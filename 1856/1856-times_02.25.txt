1 OXLyrABKTfland CITY INTELLIGENCA:. Saturday Evening. The English funds opened this morning at an pd. vance of a quarter per cent., and the market Iubsequently showved increased finnness. Consols l money vwere first qutoted 91i to i, and they 'lftDff -gt 94 to a. For the account the last pri- e to J.

Nmerous small tales of the secp -f, the luew loan, amounting in the aggregate to ax considerable siun, -were ef£ected during the day, and but for this circumstance the rise inl prices n-ould most probably have been to a Vr'-.ater extent. In the Stock-Exchange there was .aiuxch diminution in the pressure for money; but * the discount-market was wvithout any material alter- ation. The recorded transactions in Conlsol scrip were at I. and 1@ premium, and the last quotation w-as 1A; Exchequer scrip was negotiated at & and Ij premium, and left off at 1}.

Exchequer-bills improved to 2s. discount to Is. premiumi2. Eoreign securities exhibited firmness, and in some cases there was a further advanice. Several transactions took place in Tlrkish Six per Cents. at a. inprovement of about a half per cent.. those for money being at 94, and for the accotunt .at 94j, 94? 941, 94a, and 5v.

The final quotations of the French Three per C-tents, ox the Paris Bourse this evening wvere 73f. 25c. for money and 73f. 45c. for the end of the MIGnth, showing a further rise of a quarter per cent. At Vienna there is still some tendency to reaction from the recent iinprovenimnt. The mercantile advices from Paris describe increased firinness in the rate of exchange. Indeed, The idea seems to be entertained in some quarters of zending gold coin to this country. A return has just been published by the Board of Trade of the grain and floiur imported into this country during the year :155v, distingu3ishling the relative proportions from the various sources of supply. The total taken of grain of all sorts appears to have been l5,729,24. quarters, and of flour },922,318cwt. This presents a considerable diminution from 1854, when the quantities were of grain 6 850,498 quarters, and of flour 3,705,lOlcwt. Subjo3ned is a condensation of the principal figures of the list. The quaniity ordinarily to have been lookecd for from Russia, :gainst which there is nowv ablank, maybe estimated at about 1,500,000 quarters of grain:- DE the above total of grain the quantities of each description were Wheat ..67,7.02 BadIey . ... .. ... 3349,10 oat, . . ,033,727 Peas. . .. .

Of peas the iargest importation was from Denmark and the Hanse towns. The beans were Principally from Egypt. Of the Indian corn the United States supplied more than half, and the remaainder was mostly from Greece and Egypt. The railway meetings of the week have included several of the principal companies, the proceedings being in connexion with the declaration of dividends. The London and North-Western dividend of 21. 32s. 6d. for the half-year has been confirmed, mnaking, with the previous payment, a total of o per cent. for the year. The reports both of the directors and of the Committee of Consultation appear t-o have afforded satisfaction, ihe resolutions recommended by the Latter having been agreed to. The .nicable relations established between the Creat Western and North-Western Companies and {he competition by the Great Northern Company wiere the principal topics taken into consideraion; but a beneficial mediation has been accomplished. According to the South-Eastern report, the balance in hand wvill allowv of a distribution of 13s. 3d. per share, beinog at the rate of 41. Ss; 4d. per cent. per annum, leaving a surplus off6,9131. to-be carried to the credit of the next six Mnomths. At the Londonderry and Ennislkilen Tneeting the report was adopted, and it was men..ioned that while the traffic exhibits a considerable increase, there has been a diminution in the working -expenses. The payment of a dividend of 6s. on thke first preference shares is equivalent to about 3 percent. per annum on the w;hole stock of the compary, nwhich-is regarded as an indication of favourable progress, considering previous difficulties. A reseirtion *was passed to enable the company to rase theremainder of the new capitaL. The dinidend- of the East Lancashire Railway is at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, leaving 3,0961. to be Iaied to the reserve fund, which amounts to - W00L The report of the Dundalk and Ennis- ;idlln t)ompany states that the directors are in a~ vitin to discharge the o per cent, due on -thef - ie of the preference shares, besides the interx.st on the Ciovernment and other loans, ,md .iso fo continue the payment of the usual Zividei\d of Os. per share on the ordinary share capital. At-the meetiDg of the Mladras Railway the report X carried, and a resolution Was passed intimatinm thia; it is not desirable to enter into liabilities fc T a 3nev line iwithout the general consent of the propi ietors The dividend of the Blackwall Railway L as been confir=aed at the rate of 3s. 6d. Iper share.: nd the report was adopted. Since the conmmcncem tnt of the year the passenger traffic has -increased, an d the revenus from other departments has also impr wod. The report of the MAon lds Company shon's a davidend zt the rate of CA per cent. on the cowolidated shales, after providiiig, in theisualmanner, forfheloari,ldguaranteedcharges. According, to the report of the ,Great Northern Railway, the dividend on the original stock is at the rate of 6 per cent. per anna-m, making, with -the former payment, a total of 4V per cent. for the y.ear. The dividend of the Royson and Hitchin C4ompany is at the rate of 4 per cet. per annum. t-'he report of the Scinde I?ailwy hasbeen received as satisfact;ory, the pre]iminary expendture having been conduct'ed with economy. Trhe saeholders of the 1iverpeo}, Crosby, and Southport Railway }have authorized th3e director3 to settle theamount of the liabilities o-bejtcd to by the Lancashine and Yorkshire Company. a the sum is too trifling fo be lloowed to imperil the ar'ement. At the Glocekfer and Dean torest Padl.vay {he report was agreed to, and adividend of 12s. p'ersbslre was declared. The dividends of the Hull and , elby Company are at the iate of21 9s, 2 C, on :the . ihar 1, J.s s11-ho 25t. shares, and 12D. 4Ld. on the 121. los. ishnres. At the Stockton and Darlington meeting the dividend wvas at the rate of 9 per cent. ton the ordinary capital, o per cent, on the 3>2eference dhmtits, and 6 per cent, on the Wear Valley and hhIltdsborough and iedear s}hares, The sharcholders have authlorized the ivrewors to carry out the agreement for working -.ad nia ng the Darlington and Barnard Castie line.

THE PRIZE OM1INIBUS. The following are the terms of the award of the gentlemen to whom the extremely difficult task of selecting the best design for an omnibus had been delegated by the London General Omnibus Company "To THE DrP.ECTOS Or To E LOS-ION GENERAL OsiLnMUS COMPANY. "Gentlemen,-Acting in accordance with your request, as adjudicators upon the designs for an omnibus sent in reply to your offered premium of 1001. for the best, we have hadbefore us designs and models submitted by 75 competitors. Several of these baving been deposited after tho date fixed in your advertisement, or on other grounds not coming within the terms of the competition, were at once put aside; the remainder we have carefully examined with reference to the requirements set forth by you and to the police regulations; and wve have first to express our regret that, alt¶iough many of the proeositions display considerable ingenuity, and offer here and there improvements, we do not fnd any one design of supereminent merit, or calculated an its present shape to afford that increased amount of comfort and accommodation your company, with praiseworthy foresight, desires to give the pubic, and which, moreover, will doubtless be looked for at your hands. "'Inasmuch, however, as we are required to select one of the designds as the best of those submitted, considered with regard to your stipulations and wn.ts, we beg leave to pointout the design No. 04, sent in by Mr. Miller, of H memith. Inquiry of Mr. 31iler, and the examiNation of a fuli-siasd omnibus built by him (after arriving at this determination), have shown4 us that if his intentions were more completely expressed in his drawing than is the case the design wvould be more worthy of the premium. "WAe must repeat that we find no design that we con recoimmend for adojption intact, or which, to speak truly, is worth the premuim offered; but there are points about some of them which, being combined, weuld aid in producing what you and the nubIle desire-a light, commodious, and well-ventilated onujibus.

THE SUNDAY QUESTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDIES. Sir,-I am sure I am expressng the feelings of hundreds of thousands in thanking you for your opposition to the religious agitators on this subject, and particularly for ypur leading article on Thursday. The numerous petitions presented to Parliament by the ascetic party in nowise represent the opinion of the majority of the people of England. They appear to do so only because the other side is quiescent. If we may judge of the petitions by the speeches made at the meetings at which they are got up, a new religiou,s doctrine is propounded relative to Sunday-namely, that on that day "all pleasure" is inconsistent with duty. On wvhat authority is this grounded? NSot on the law of Mloses. The fourth conmmandmnent forbids " work" on the Sabbath, but does notforbid " amusament." Not on the law of Christ, who on more than one occasion showed his disapprobation of the strictness with which the Jews construed that commandment. Not on the teaching of theapostles, or the practice of the early Christians, who, so far from straitenamg the Jewish law on this head, dispensed with it altogether by appointing a new day in the week for rest and religious observances-a change which surely they would have never made if they had considered the fourth commandment literally binding on Christians, or of any further authority than as show,ing the Divine will that some day shouild be set apart for rest from toiL. The banishment, not merely of work, but of amusement also, from the Sunday oriinuated, I beheve, with John KRnox; and the Covenanters. Let Sc6tland follow their example if she pleases, the English are not Presbyterians. lscept, perhaps, to one in a hundred thousand, the day wilbe no day of rest, if innocent secular amusement be excluded. The ennui consequent on such a state of things would be worse than the heaviest hodily labour, and Monday would be regarded as a relief. A few chosan spirits there doubtless are, to whom it is the highest happiness to spend their leisure in praver and praise and communing Iwith God. HIappy and enviable are such; but it is noto- rious that they are hut few, and to insist on the multitude Iircitating them outwardly, before they have the grace for |doing so inwardly, is simply " to put the cart hefore the [ horse." Those who thinks to force a nation into spiritual enjoyment by merely debarring it from seeular enjoyment show a lamentable ignorance of human nature. If the present agitation continues and increases it will end, not by Imaking us all saints, .but by provoking a reaction which will jmake us all worse sinners than we are. The question how far, practically, every individual can have Sunday as a, day of rest, or by what arrangements the cinintumu of labour can be attained on that day, is a serious and interesting one; but it is not that which is so noisily rgitated. Amusement which involves no one's -work isas sternly forbidden as that which interferes with the rest of others. I fact, this, which is the real difficulty, is so much put on one'side that, as far as I know, the most enthusiastic have not contended for the entire suppression of all- secular work.(of that of domesties, for instance) on Sundays. Altogpther this agitation seems to lead to such bad)results tli't I A.Ttild rejoice in it, Were I as much an tnemy as J am - : , I I A ll=wp QIV WAUZ RBLIGION. I ? ,,,

STEA TO AUSTBALiA. TO TE EDITOR OF TH TIl S. Sir,-Refering to the valuable article in i2we inmes of the 19th inst. relative to a rnpid communication with our Australian colonies, as apphed to postal arrangements, E wish to mal;e a few suggestions, which, though already known to the public, have not as yet been carried out. Tho importance of the subject cannot be overrated, for not only does the continuance of Britain's influenco in the southerm hemisphere depend upon its speedy accomplishment, but her commercial and private relations with so extensive an, offshoot of her empire are to receive the fresh vigour of a new life at the same time. There can be no doubt that the ahortest and quickest route to Sydney (viz., in 50 days) is ril Panama, and the only drawback is the want of steam between Panama andi Sydney. The Royal West India mail steAmers could surely be made available to Aspinwall. Then there is the, railway across the Isthmus, and perhaps the Pacific Steam Navigation Company might think it worth its while to un. dertakce the remainder of the route. If not, enternrise andE capital, united to a portion of the Government subsidy, wmll not be lam in coming forward, I Lope, either in Great Bri. tami or America. Coaling stations in the Pacific, I think, arm thediffculty in the way, and yet there is no want of islands on which the depots could be formed. Otaheite, Ocaro, New Caledoma, Cape North, or the Bay of Isands inm ew Zealand (where one mail could bc left), are very suitable. There is coal in New South Wales and New Zealand, and surely, aided by supplies from North and South America and Great Britain, no great difficulty can be experiencea on this head. From Sydney themain ne canatoncepro. ceed to Melbourne, Adelaide, and King Gorge's Sound leaving the Tasmanian mails at the former place. I asi, ought not Sydney, the metropolis of Australia, to be cor. sidered before King George's Sound? I am. Sir. vour obedient servant. B. S. I Hu1, Feb. 2L.
FATAL RAiLwAY AcCIENT.-On Friday an a journed inquest wasterminated upon the bodies of 'Williatt Rigby and Henry Hudson, the latter the driver and thi former the stoker of a train from Derby, which came ints collision with one from Burton at the Longton station o: the North Staffordshire Railway at midnight yesterday week. The two deceased were killed by the accident, an( property to a large amount was destroyed. The circurn stances attending the collision were these --At half-p)ast L' o'clock a goods train from Burton, consisting of 27 waggons arrived at Longton, and stayed there to take up several truc 3 loads of iron, &e. The train was half an hour behind th time specified for its arrival in the company's table there wvas also some ununsal and unavoidable dc lay in shunting; and before the trucks of iron could b properly disposed m the Burton train a goods train frox elerby was found to be dne. The guard of the Bnrtoh trai thereupon went up the line a considerable distance to met the expected train. He iminediately saw the traiun, an being alarmed at the rapidity of its approach, he waved h red signal light, to intimate that there was danger. App, rently heedless of his motions, and of the danger sign turned on at the semalhore against the platform of the pa senger stion, the driver shot past nith his train, ar dashed into the Burton waggons, which were standing b tween the passenger and luggage stations. In the coJlsit the engine and teuder of the Derby train, with the driv and fireman, and a number of waggons belonging to bo trains, were pitched over the embankment, which is of co siderable elevation. Here the engine lay deeply embedd. in the soiL Its fore part was stove completely in, and varions other respects it was greatly damaged. Six seven of the naggons were smashed, and their valu ble contents, including Burton ale, hardware, Chest4 field brown ware, glass in crates, bales of silk-, &c., destroy er damaged. The destruction of property ;as aggravat by the sudden igntion of a large qan;tity of grease, whi formed a portion of the luggage. The driver and stol were found anderoeath the tender, having upon the-n eight ofnL2uto 4 tons. They were speedcy dug ont, a both were at that time alive. In a very short time tl were removed to the Infirmary. On the way thither, immediately after his arrival, the stokver, 'William Rigby single ran, 31 years of age, died.

Evidence havig been given in corroboratior the facts above stated, the jury came to the conufusiorK the collision w hich caused the death of William R-ighy< Henry Hudson was occasioned by the Latter driving his gine at a greater speed than was allowved by the regulati oftherail-ayrcompany.

All the fabrics usually exported for the markets-of India aTe ueglected, or takenonly ansmnall quantities, and after the discouraging accounts by ithe three last snails sellers have a difficulty in the preaent quiet and unexcited state of our markee in obtainig the full prices given last week. Manufacturers of these eods however, are mostly under contracts entered into ore this change came over the market. In T-cloths, in several kinds of long-cloths, and-in printers, there is a better demanud, ald prices are rather fialy maintained. Some of our largest houses engaged inthe country trade a2e rather busy, and have made considerable clearances, and the prospects of an early and fine spring are favouzable to this branch of our trade. If the negotiations at Paris should give indications of a succeoni-R issue at an early period, probably no branch of our trade would receive a healthier impulse from such a pro,pect thinv that wihich has its scat amen" our own population. Both buyers and sellers of*our manufactures await the result of these negotiations with intense anxiety. The yarnmarket continues, like tho cloth-market, to show less auimation than last week, but extreme prices have been demnded (spinners being mostly under contracts), in some cases probably to an exctent which - has checLed business.

All reports received from South Staffordshire represent the iron trade to be languid in comparison with its state a few weeks ago. lhatever may be the cause-the stingency of the mroney-market at home oran antiIpatedlrnpture with the United States-there has been a f ig off n the North American demand, and orders from the Liverpool houses are not so freely given as immediately subsequent to last quarter-day. It is stated that the price of bars has suffered a decline, the commoner qualities to the extent of IOs. and upwards; but we believe this reduction has been chiefly confined to the smaaUer class of makers, and that the first firms exact the rates fixed by the trade in January. The " marked" houses are in a condition almost at ell times, certainly unless in times of great depression, to maintain for the current quarter at least the established prices of the trade, and up to the present period nothing has occurred likely to cause an alteration of their lists. In our last we stated that no correct opinion can be formed as to the probable requirements of the spriug trade with North America until the month of March, and, as it is confidently expected that next arrivals will dissipate the gloom which ramours of war have cast over the trade of that market, renewed activity is anticipated. There is an average demand for the ironstone of the district at 2X per ton, but foreign introductions are repre. sented to beless. The coal trade, as might be expected a' this season of the year, is not so active as before Christmas, but, notwithstanding, prnces are WeIrmaintained. It is questionable, however, whether present high rates can be much lonper supported. The better descriptions of brooch coal wvMi at all times, notwithstanding, find their way to distant markets for domestic purposes, at good prices. The new regulations under the Mine Inspection Act continue to create uneasiness in the collieries, and in some districts are equaUy objected to by proprietors and men. By those not immediately affected by them they are considered wise and necessary, and likely in the long ran to produce a very salutary effect. The copper-market is firm, and those fears of a reduction to which we referred a few weeks ago are, for the present at least, dissipated. Tin plates continUe to maintain the quotations whlich have ruled for the last few weeks, and ano movement either one way or the other is considered immediately probable. There is little new to be reported with respect to the varied and general manufactures of Birmingham and the neighbourhood. They mostly sympathize in a considerable degree with the state of the iron trade. The brassfounders of the town, if we except those large establishments engaged upon popular patents, such as first-class brass bedsteads, are not over busy, and some of them are absolutely slack. Factors, influenced bye the reluctance of the ironmongers of the coulnty to purchase more than is absolutely required for stocks, are equally averse to give out orders to manufacturers. It is knowen, however, that country stocks are becoming low, and, according to the opinion of commercial men, if money was easier, orders would be abundant. Miany of our factors, notwithstandingthedulness whichprevails in some branches of trade, state that they have little reason to complain, and are at any rate, mach busier than they were 12 or 15 months ago. The tin-work establishments of the towvn and neighbourhood, unlike the brasafounders, are almost, without an exception, fully and profitably employed in the malke Icf the veryg best description of goods, and there have been some extensive orders given out in Birmingham during the present wreek for the manufacture of plated goods-a descriptionof manufacture winch was apparently being fast superseded byelectro-plated articles. Snob has been the success of the last-mentioned patent that the artisans employed in the old plated business have of late years been greatly reduced in numbers; and those still in the mannufacture have been for a considerable peiiod very indifferently employed. The orders recently received would appear to indicate a re-ival of this old and once flourishin" branch of local trade i but let its success for the future be as great as hoped for, it cannot, as is reasonably supposed, in any way mterfere with the higher descriptions of edectro-plated goods, however it may damage thosenumerous inferior productions which, to the injury of the manufacture, find their way more especially into the foreign market. The heavy steel toy trade is among those which have slightly improved, and which may still further be expected to increase as the spring advances. For agricultural implements the demcand is moderately good, but, as these are, as well as all descriptions of husbandry tools, usually greatly in demand at this season of the year, their sale affords no indication of the general state of the hardware trade. The military gun trade is increasingly active. Government contracts are rendered continual, and, so far from a prospect of peace stopping the progress of Tower work, the orders ir. hand are urged forward with renewed earnestness. The manufacturers, as well as the men, now seem to treat with indifference the new Government manufactory in course of erection at Enfield, satisfied that the Ordnance works will not be able to compete with the private gunmakers of this town. The greatest harmony appears to exist between the Board of Ordnance and the contractors. The chief event in the Birmingham District Court of Bankuptcy during the present week has been the examination of Mr. Greene, the Lchfield banker. The debts already proved under the flat amount to about 140,000?.; and, according to the evidence of Mr. Greene, there will be a deficiency upon the winding-up of the estate of 60,0001. Iadthe bank stoped earlier, when he first became aware of its insolvency, the deficiency would have amounted to 70,000t. When, in December last, Smith, Payne, and Smith, sis London agents, declined to make any further advances, MIr. Greene could have given additional securitieato that finn, but, knowing the situation of his bank, and thelarge deposits whichwere usuallylodged at the commencement of the year, he thought he shod not be ustfied i ca n on any longer, and he closed the banlc. TAe insolvency of the bank he mainly attributed to the Lrge deficiency of MLr. Palmer, his late partner. It was stated ia court, although not openly, that the assets from parties who had overdawn their accounts at the bank were coming in most satisfactorily. Mr.Chippendale, late sub-manager, has been appointed managerof the Birmingham branch of the Bank of EBgland, in the room of Captain Tindal, now of the West London Bank, and Mr. Brown, of the Liverpool Bank, succeeds Mr. Chippendale in the Birnningham establishment. The Directors of the Birmingham Town and Distriet Bank have in the course of the present week declared a dividend for the half-year of 5s. per share (201. per share; 31. paid up), with a bonus of 2s. Id. per share f;ee from income. a,andpayable on the 1st cf M1arch.- A Prospectus in favour of the establishmenteof another bankEing company in Bnmrmngham has made itS appearanee, but fiom the absence of any information as to who are its promoters it does not appear likely to meet with any great amount of encourage- The Birmingham Chamber of Comnmerce have determinedl toetition against the Partnership AmendmentBrill now ore Parliament, unless the clauses of the bill of last session in reference to regisation and certain liabilities in the event of bankruptcy be introduced. NOT-' lNGHMU, Fun. 23. The demand for lace never was Imown to be so active or so general and extensive at this early period of a year as it has been during the last week The number of buyers who have visited our warehouses is a 3nattet of astonishment. In addition to the larger purchasers, whose attendance here has been hastened by the olydays falling earlierthan usua and by the fact that goods are rising in value, andimust advance still fnrther, the cheap trains of the Midland and Great Northern Railway comaies have broughtmany smaller buyers, whose attendance here is uausuaL The last steamers from America brou*ht, further very large orders for goods'of various kinds, with the information that the 'United S-tates ' srn trade haz opened* very favourablr6 This asadded to thegbustle.and excit.emnt of the week in ourlace marts. The goods most in demand are black and white silk laces, edgings and quillings, plain nets, and to some extent curtains. There would le a very large trade oin the latter if our manufacturers would produce none but goods of the best clasa as regards workmanhip; but complaint6 are made by buyers that the quality in too- many instances is deteriorated for the pur. pose -of' cheapening them. The result is that miuslin curtans in too many instances are recommended and sold in preference, Freanch competitors axe za4. to bc preqpain; to enter into the manafacture of laco-ncu= witI the fn,'ttionof beating us both in quality and design. It is tht. fault of the Nottingham manufacturers, who at present kave the trade entirely in their own hands, if they do not attain their original position. When 'well and honedly made, and of good patterns,, othing can excel thc' beauty and usefulness of lace curtains; but, 'if deteniorted in the manufacture, few things are of less utility. Complaints are made in some quarters. that tho great business doing in lace does not yield- an adequate amount af profit. 7Lis, however, must be' expected. Though the mucch larger number of manufacturers creates a better supply, and tends to cause lace to find its way in greater abin. dance into all markets, at a time of limited demand itbrings down prices. Manufacturers in shoals, when trade is du find their way into the London warehouses, and force the sale of their goods at low rats ; and, even when business is somewhat brisk, buyes ing6eniously contrive, by pittirig one homse against another, to plant their orders on favourable terms. The jobbing which took place last winter, however, cleared off stocks, and the unexpectedly large and early demand now finds us with but few goods, in hand. To complete orders much of our machmiery has to be kept incessantlyin motion. This, combined with high wages and the advancing prices of silk and yarns, has caused t e rise in the value of goods which we have described, and prices must continue to increase. The string fashions are highly favourable to the lace trade, and it is believed will cause much larger quantities of our productions to be used in trimming than ever was the case before. In the hosiery branches, though the demand has been pretty nearly un to that of the last week, the- advances whic have taken place have somewhat checked purchases. The rise, which has been sudden and -great, and whichtookplaceatatinae when stocks in the handsof spinners and manufacturers were exceedingly low, falls with immense weight upon heavy cottots goods and- low circulars. In the higher branches of the manufacture it is scarcely felt, but in these the effect is to increase the valuo so ihmensely as seriously to injure the trade. Merino yarns have advanced this week ls. (d. per bundle, and cashmeres and fine woollens 2s. to Ss. per 101b. Silk and spun silk are 6d. per lb. dearer. Yarn and silk merchants are exceedingly busy. They have an ample choice of orders, and many are declined. This healthy and flon. risbing trad es an excellent stimulus to the new silkthrowiang mills established in this neighbourhood, inasmuch as the proprietors readily obtain from Is. to Is. od. Yer lb.more for their producethan do tlrowsters at a distance, in consequence, in the first place, of producing articles better suited to local manufactures; and, secondly, because they have obtained t'he confidence of manufacturers by avoiding the system of depreciation too generally indulged a elsewhere. Tho frauds practised upon both lace mannfactures and hosiers in past days have been fearfuL By the use of soap, white lead, seaweed, and other substances throwsters succeeded for some time in cheating their customers and obtaining undue profits. - But, others resorting to the same system, competition reduced this dishonest profit to nothing, while indulgence in such practices de- sed the workpeople, and in too many instances induced them secretly to rob the employers who systematically taught them to'rob others. Thus undermined, the houses that have cardied on their business in such a manner are either giving way or are already gone, being unable to withstand a .airly-made material at a higher price. The moral taught by the fall of a class of ap arently established houses in the silk trade, and the rapidrise of others, whose business is conducted upon an opposite system, mry serve, if rightly considered, as a raost instructive lesson to manufactures of every description. LEICESTEIR, FE. 23. There has this vweek been a decided improvement in the plain hosiery trade connected with the home market, and there is a clearing out of stocks. The prices given are, however, very low, and our manufacturers are still loud in their complaints that goods are atthe present being disposed of at the same price as was given before the advance took place in the raw matenrial. At present machinery is tolerably employed, the supply beimg fuly equal, if not, indeed, exceedin' the demand. Yarns are very firm, and an advance of a habZpenny per lb. has this week been asked by the spinners; the demand is, however, restricted. Wools have an upward tendency, holders being firm at the late advance. Farmers7 lotsrealize 3Ms. to 35s. per tod. LEEDS, F'fa. 2.3. The markets have been very animated to-day and a large amount of cloth has changed hands. The safes have exceeded those of this day se'nnight, and that was the best market this year. Prices have advanced, but scarcely equal to the increased cost of both the Wool and the dyes to be used at an early day by most manufacturers. Well-made plain woollens, as also tweeds and mixtures, have left the talls to-day in larger quantities than was anticipated from the tone of quietness which had apparently crept over the tTade at the early part of the week. The grounds for believing that the peace negotiations at Paris will end in lan honourable peace appear to strengthen, and help to give confidence to commercial enterrise, which is also aided by the strong position which the Oovernment hold on the war in the estimation of the different political parties both w-ithin and without the walls of Parliament. The ready way in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been met in his new loan and the funding of Exchequer. bills has shown that capitalists have faith in the-present Administation, and has helped to improve what may be termed the trading feeling of the country. Concurrent with these cireumstances, or rather as a result from them, the manufacturers are increasing their worlk, and the operatives are obtaining better employment; and this is to be observed as respects the vorsted and linen as well as the woollen branches. From investigations which have been made and the judgment of competent parties there seems little prospect of there being any sudden fall in the prices of the raw materials of the woollen and worsted manufactures. The stocks are far from being large, and are not above an ordidary demand. As one consequence of the rise in the price of indigo and other dye goods, itis understoodthat the dyers of leeds will advance their charges next Monday ls. per stone for blacks and 2s. per stone for blues. The Bradford markets have rather tightened in prices during the week, but only a moderate amount of business has been done in either inpieces, yarns, or wools. In pointtof fact, prices are in a transition state, but probably they rill become somewhat fix-ed during the ensuing week. A good deal of anxiety is felt in Bradford about the American question, a large trade being done vith Bradford goods in the IJnoited EStates. The report of the falifax market of this day is to the effectthat prices of goods are creeping up, and that wools and yarns are fuly as high as at the commencenient of the week. Onlya moderate amount of business, however, had been done. Anotbr (lll we&hasDUBIJN, Fsu. 23. Another dull week has passed over our commercial affairs durmin which trade maybe said to have enjoyed a repose which was not at all conducive to the prosperity in which healthy and vigorous action would place it. Credit is fairly supported, but the uncertain state of the war question, in the face of all the efforts being made to conclude the contest, maintains a timidity amid the commercial public e-xtremely hostile to enterprise; and the burdens which the public have to bear, being only slightly lightened by falling prices of provisions, act as a drag upon the operations of trade, against which theystruggle in vain to restoreordinary activity. Smithfield on Thursday was an exceedingly dull markets though prices were verymuch below even the reduced rates of the previous market-day; and in the provisionmrket also there w.as little business transacted at previous prices. The Customs' receipts for the week, to Thursday mclusive, were 13,9371., against 14,0041. last week. The following is an abstract of duties received at the port of Dublin for the week ending February 1o, .1856:-Tea, 5,1451. 8s. 6d.; refined sugar, 5281. Uls. 8d.; muscovado sugar, 1,906. 16s.; coffee, 1461. 9s. 6d. ; wine, 276L. Is. 6d.; spirits, (3311. lOs. 5d.; tobacco, 4,40it. 9a lild.; timber, 3S'71 2a 3d.; miscellaneous, 2721. 4s. 2d. The Stock-Exchange has been agitated this^ week bythe effects of the loan, but a fair share of business has een ttransacted. The dealing in shares were not extensive, and prices experienced lttle or no change worthy of notice. BELFAST, F^. 23. 3LKiwS.-The linen manufactures continue very healthy. Times of greater activity -could easily be pointed out, and seasonswwhen higher prices prevailed -would not be difficult to remember, but rarely has the trade been so frea from speculative influences or so fully upheld by its own legitimate action. - Bleachfields are at present in full operation. All the advantages of moderate weather, and al the aid of chymical science are brought together in order more effectuaUy to facilitate the progreas of finish. Stocks attho warehobses had accumulatedto some extent durng the last monthkAn improvement in thehomeas well asthe foreign demind for linens has moved off a large proportion of t1h accurairations, and ere the close of the present month it is expected that a considerable reduction of stocks will have taken place. Brown mrarkets were not so largely attended during the early part of last weelc. The weather, the munertainty felt on the American question, and the continued pressure on the money-market had each its separate effecton buyers; and until the last two days only a smiall amount of business was transacted. Fancy goods were pretty we,ll cleared off at Lurgan oni Thursday, and at Bally maena on Saturday some improvement was noted as compared 'vith the previous market. Hands still continue scarce, and if we had a definite arrangement of peace the operatives engaged at the coarser qualities of linen in the North of- Ireland would not be equal to meet above onethird the demand for that class of goods. Spinners have had more-active markets for the last ten days. Demand for immediate consmption is pretty good, and top qualities of warps; from 30 to 150 lea, sell at full rates. r X-fla -mnarkets have been well supplied. iCoarse fibreis rather fim, and fine unchanged. Handscutched old at from 6s.to 7s. Sd. per stone; and milled, from 7s. to I2i. per stone.

Corrom.-hn the cotton trade wve may note full activity, and anore espeCally in the finer departuients of the enterprise. T-he merican markets are generally looking out for superior styles of goods; and, whether in the plain or fancy departments, prime qua;itites are chiefly sought after.

Heywood, High Sheriff of the county. - - e ' - - The MYOR sad, he had- great pleasure in callig the meeting, especially when -hesaw that the requisition-had been signed by all classes of the people, whose common object was to resist an attack 'upon the town dues, the-grod amount of which,' he reminded the meetig, was not owing to increased rates, but, to the expansion of commerce. He observed further, on unquestionable authority, that there was property to an enormous amount, owned by noblemen, which was held under the same tenure as that under which they owned the town dues. If an inroad was to be thus made upon the 'igbtsof propertythose who were making this attack mightyet be iwhipped vithttheir own'rod. Seeing the number of gentlemen around him who were prepared to address the meetin on the subject, he would now call upon the Deoty Town-clerk to read communications from those who had been unable to attend. ILetters were read fromi r. Charles Turner, chairman of -the dock committee, Mr. 'J. A. Tobin, ein-mayor of the borough, and Mr... Hugh Hornby, chairman of the local finance committee; stating that they were in London in connexion with matters of importance bearing upon the bill .from lb.' Earle, a member of the council, stating that absenco from Liverpool proventedbim from attending, and from Mr. Alderman J. H. Turner and Dr. Bicha rdrool, pleading illness as the cause of their absence. The iGHr SBlnIFF of the county, being of opinion that the corcoration had a -legal right' to the town dues, and believing further that the funds derived from them had been largely applied to the advantage of the trade and commerce of the kingdom in general, and of the lancashire and Cheshire manufacturing districts especially, moved a resolution to the effect,- " Thit this meeting has learnt with astonishment that abill has been introduced into Parliament by the Vice. P:resident of the Board of Trade, by which it is proposed to deprive the corporation, and many other seaport towns, both in England and Wales, of a revenue which they legally derive from dues on goods and shipping." -Mr. G. HOLT, merchant (a member of the town-council), iiiseconding the proPosition, urged that the bill introduced into the House by Mr. Lowe was. a direct attack upon the great municipal institutions of the country; that it was an :ivasion of those rights and privileges which in all time had becn of great service in the promotion-of freedom and enlightened policy, both locally and generally. EHe did not presume to say that the Legislature in its largest sense-of King, Lords, and Commons-might not, in their discretilo deal with a corporate estate in some degree, but it was quite imposiible that they could do so unless they proved abuse or n-administration. How did this question stand in connexion with Liverpool? In this town there was a vast dock estate belonging to the nation, from which there was no private interest and no dividend assing. to LiverpooL The dock-rates were merely levied for the purpOSes of anaintainini the docks, of extending, improving, and rendering thiem useful for the whole commerce of the courtry and of the world; while the revenue derived from the town dues had been mainly devoted to purposes of a national character. If these dues should be taken away-it s im ble for such a thing to occur-ht if the were taken frm the corporation, would the gentleen oF Man Chester, Bolton, and other towns around have a remittance of their rates? Not a farthing. Did they think the Board of Trade would administer the dues bettor than the corpora tion had done? ("No, no !") Havingmadesomepassing observations upon the inaccuracies spoken-he might ahmost say the foolernes enacted-at the meeting in Manchester on Thursday, he asserted that the inlhabitants paid largely for its sewering, its own poor, and the poor devolving upon it in connexion with its peculiar 'ont on, and for its sanitary operations. (Hear, hear.) The commerce of the world passed through the streets of liverpool, which, he repeated, had used its town dues very largely for national purposes. Entertaining these views, it did appear to ff. scarcely possible that the Legislature would attuempt, with a knowledge of the whole question, to ass this bilL The resolution was put and earried unanimously. Mr. GRABVS, vice-chairman of the Liverpool Shipowners' Association, in moving the second resolution, as one largely connected with the shipping trade, desired to point out one of the fallacies into which the Vice-President of the Board of Trade had fallen. The right hon. gentlenmaii, in bring'in forward his bill, had urged that the town dnes bore heavily upon the chipping interest. The Board of Trade had been repeatedly memorialized to remove the burdens upon shi piegr consequent upon the present consular system. Intad, however, of doing that, the Vice-President of the Board of Trade had listened to the clamours of a few individuals, and, instead of paying attention to their repeated claims for redress, he got up a grievance of his own-agrievance which be (the speakor) honestly declared had never beencomplad bthe shipowners of this country, and from vwhich they had never asked to be relieved-a bill by which it was proposed to take the dues from the corporation and place them in the hands of Her Majesty's Customs, ultimateI7 to reach the Board of Trade, who should have sole and irresponsible power over them either to abolish, continue, or allocate them for their own purposes. (Hear, hear.) As a shipowner, he considered the bill, if passed, would end in increased burdens upon the trade and commerce of the country. The Shipowners' Association of Liverpool, at a meeting on Thursday, had unanimously resolved to oppose the bill. (Cbeers.) Referrin to the undertal3ng made by the corporation to comaplete the Birkenhead docks, he expressed his belief that if the dues were taken out of their hands they would be unable to fulfil the engagement, and that one of the first results of the measure would be an increase of the dock-rates to the mnazinm2ns amount, and that, consequently, the passing of the bill, instead of giving relief, would impose a burden upon the shipowners and upon the trade of the surrounding districts. (Hear, hear.) Being of this opinion, he had geat pleasure in moving the folloNNin- resolution - 11 hat the dues on goods carried in ships and on the anchorage of ships, being only Is. 3d. per ship, have existed for upwards of 6i0years, forming part of the ancient right of the Crown; that they were sold from time to time by the Kings of England; that they were ultimately purchased by the burgesses of Liverpool, and that they have been declared their legal property after a full inquiry before a Lord Chief Jstice of England and a special jury." Mr.. Blts?nrIm , a large shipowner, a resident in the town 17 years, and a member of a firm whose vessels have frequented the port for more than 40 years, seconded the resolution, on the ground that the corporation were not only entitled to the dues by right, but on the additional ground that their removal into the hands of the Board of Trade, instead of being a boon to the shipping interests ! would entail upon them additional burdens, and because the bi was based on the dangerous and unconstitutional principle of centralization. Mr.. AJ sm,, president of the local Marine Board, supported the resolution, detailing the result of the action tried before the Lord Chief Justice in 1830, when the legal right of the corporation to claim toll unon all goods entering the 3rsey was firmly established. Be viewed with astonish. ment the Government measure to confiscate their property Admit the principle, and there was no saying to what an extent it would go. The biU could not be allowed to passn, ad it would not pass; but if the Government still persevered, he trusted means would be taken to overwhelm at with evidence showing its injustice, and the injury it was likely to do to the trade and commerce of the country. (Cheers.) If it could be shown that the withdrawal of the dues would be an advantage to the general trade of the country, he would advocate their removal, not, however, without compensation. (Hear, hear.) Havin- expressed his astonishment that any member of the Government should draw a distinction between the property of individuabls and c6r,porations, observing that, accorin to Mr. Lowe's logic, if the dues had remained the property of the Earl of Soften they would still be held sacred, Mr. Aiken concluded by supporting the resolution. MEr. Snis, a member of the Deck Committee, followed in the same line of argument. The motion was thens put and carried na7n dis. MIr. A?wsmoss Lics solicitor, moved a resolution to the "That the sum of 149,000L. was levied by the corporation of the borough during the year 1855 for sanitary and other public purposes; that the sum of 123,1461. was levied in the same year for the support of the poor; and that the proposition, by a bill betore Parliament, to throw upon the burgesses of Liverpool a large amount of debt contracted on the faith of the continued enjoyment of their property, and also to throw upon them the expenses of protectig, guarding, and facilitating the conveyance of upwards of 100,000,0001. worth of property which passes from every part of the country, is contraryto the main principle of lavw and justice," (Cheers) Mr. Ranaur BSoc stmA'i, the extensve shipowner, in seconding the motion, said, thepeople of Liverpool were in the habit of putting their hands to so much paper that it was expected they would accept this bill, hut he hoped they-rwould-send it hack with -a thundering pretest wrhich would cause its speedy withdrawaL. (Cheers.) MIr. J. A. Picron, architect~, and a member of the town council, sunported the proposition ina lengthyDeh in which lie Laboaed to show that the Board of TCrade were anxious to. get the property. and docks of Liverpool into their possession in order To provide themselves with au avaIlible fund for any purpose for which it might be inconvenient toask for supplies orem- Parliament. He cautioned Manchester against being too cunning, too sharp, reminding her that there was such a thing as going out for wool and coming homc shorn. He main. tained that the tolls in Liverpool, when compared with the shipping accommodations provided, were less. than in any port in the country, and reviewed some of the clauses of the bill, showing what, in his opinion, were the disguised intentions of the Board of Trade, who reserved to themselves the modest powvers of reducing the tolls, of appropriating them to what purpose they; choseo-of abolishing them altogether, which they would not do, or of increasing them again to their full extent if they deemed fit. Mr. ,owe liad spoken ofthe trade flowing from Liverpool to the-ancient city of Chester. Why, they might depend upon it that the right hon. gentleman must have derived his infornationfrom thatvenerable;oldcladyhis graudmother,who, no doubt, remembered the day when Chester throve with a provision export trade. He warned the country that Go. vernment, if they got these dues tnd the dock estate-ia theirpossession, woulduse the power they would thus have for political purposes; twitted Government with not krnowing how to manage their own affairs, urginz that one Ealitlava was suffiient for one agec;-and, ai uding to the - origin of the bill, traced- it to the venge3ance of one dis-- appointed in former tumes (referring to MIr. CardwelrUs faluare whena acandidate for the borough).' "The voise,"' they sd, "was the voice of. Jaceb, but the hands wer I the hands of hsau." (Cheers.) - The-'resolition was cardied unaniinouslyr - 3fr.' ld'Fi of the large sugar rem*ning rin, *hose goods. he sai,paid more tom- dees than those of all the old and young ladies in Manchester,- moved the next resDlution,, to the effect-That the trade and comuerce of the lIdngdomsnhare been greatly benefitted by the expesditure of dues collectedl in Ltverpool, of whichl more tb-a l,000,000 sterling hil beern expended in widenink and forsg newfapproaches and commnunications to and from the d1ock which now. extend five muies in Jenigth, and aordl accommodation to 4,5~0,0 001. worth of shippingyearly, andfrounwhich docks the corporation of lIverpool receive no revenue whatever; more thau -7,0,OOOI. has been. expenaea for the purpowcs of the conser-vaney And improvemient of the port, that upwards of 2o,0OO. inteescontiected uwitcommerce while they are undes an obligation to'the extent of 320,W0oo. to construct a landin stage for eeagoing =ners, and aldso 2,O00,OOO. for develo ing the cominercial advantages of the docks at Birkenhead workswhich, when completed, wil renderLiverpool the most commodious port in the world, but which cannot be carriedout if the corporation are deprived of two-thirds of its income. Msir. e. SMA2DAxs seconded the resolution, which was cars-red smen. d*s. Mr. T. RITHBoxy, an old reformer, moved the next resolution, protesting against the removal of the town dues from the management of the local authorities, who were bet-ter acquainted-with thewantsof the port than aforeign body Mr. AnOX, a member of the firm of Brown, Shipley, ata Co., agents for theUlnited StatesTransatlantic steamers, seconded thie proposition, which wams supported by Mr. C. wiu,vne and spirit merchant, and c3rried imni. tions to both Eouses .of: -Parliar eat, embodying the resoutions, were adopted, arnd a vote of thanks to the mayor terXnted the proceedings.

REsroi-sMsrIY OF PA R1z-NTs.---Cnrsr!., Feb. 20. -At the Town-hall this day, at petty asons, Mlr. forgan stated that he appeared by direction of the Secretary o State to prosecute a complaint against the parents of a boy who was now detained in the Beformatory at Bradwal4 w2ich had been lately opened nnder the auspices of the excellent mregistrate then in court, and which bad received the sauction of Government. The boy bad absconded from a worhiouse in a distant part of the county, where he was mniantained at the ypublic expcnse, aud haA taken with hinx some pauper clothing. IHe had been neglected by his Iparents, who were living in comparati vy prosperous cir. cnustances in Chester. It was no donbt an act of great charitv to provide an aslum where this boy mlight b.- trained for fve years to come, and it would be a protectioss, to honest boys to remove from contact with them one v might tempt them to crime. But lest, on the other hb A. reformatones should prove too attractive, the Ipgiatp" had wisely determined to lay a pecnniary burden :pMt parents by whose negligence or connivance chiIdreonasmht flallinto crime.

LONDO2, MONDAY, FEBBUARY 2.5, 1856. Fortune proverbially favours the bold and does not always withdraw her smiles from tne rash, and so the House of Peers may boast that it has triumphed for a moment over the CRoww. We have no wish to deny or dissemble the magnitude of this victory, and as little to conceal our sense of the means by which it has been obtained. The House of Peers saw in the attempt to renew peerages for life what they believed to be an invasion of their dignity and a curtailment of the privileges of their Order; their passions were excited, their fears were stimulated, and so they took the matter, into their own hands, and assumed a position requiring an impartiality which they scarcely pretended to possess. Nor was their claim to act, as judges in their own cause better founded in right than it was in fairness and sincerity. The Hlouse of Lords, as a body deriving its existence from a succession of individual acts of a higher power, does not appear to have any greater right to exercise any control over the admission of new members into its Order than any other body similarly situated. What would be said of a claim on the part of 59 County Conrt judges to resist the appointment of a sixtieth because they considered him disqualified according to the law under which they sit, or of an insurrection of the Privy Council because some member was obtruded upon it who had not, in their opinion, the proper qualifications for the office? Upon such a foundation is built the new jurisdiction, which has circumscribed the prerogative of the CRowN, and defeated a wellmeant attempt to remedy the monstrous deficiencies of the highest tribunal of appeaL The conclusion has been worthy of its commencement. At first, denying that Lord WENSLEYDATX took by his patent any peerage at all, and speaking Of him only as Sir JTIES PARKE, in utter contempt of his writ and patent, the Peers subsequently saw fit to retreat from this untenable position, and to take refuge in one which, could it be brought to any test, would surely not be more tenable-that HER MAJESTY could, by her patent, make Sir JAMSs PARKE a nobleman, blt could not by her writ make him a Peer of Parliament. The writ, the law books say, gives the seat in the House of Peers and a Peerage in fee; the patent limits the effect of the writ. The Peers hold, on the other hand, that the writ is absolutely void, and the patent limits that nullity, or, rather, extends it into a peerage for life. The conclusion, then, is, that half the Qum's prerogative remains-that, namely, which allows her to confer honours; but that the other half, which annexed to those honours a seat. in the Legisla, ture, is abrogated by a majority of the House of Peers, unless the CaowN condeseend to comply with the conditions which the Lords are pleased to prescribe for its guidance. We know not whether the struggle will be protracted, and the Lords compelled to inflict the last indignity on their SovERsIGN by refusing the bearer of her writ and patent access to the chamber from which he has been, only as far- as words are concerned, excluded. It matters little how the dispute terminates; the victory has been gained, and we have only to consider what wiU be the next step to be taken how, that the appointment of Peers for life has been established by the same proceeding to be theoreticaUy legal and constitutional and practically impossible. The remedy is gone, but the grievance remains. To reform the Peerage, by renlering it more easy of aCceES to men of shining abilities but of moderate fortunes, is denied to us, and the House must shine on by its own light with such aid as it may gain from an occasional legal luminary who has, in addition to a profound knowledge of the. law, the equally indispensable talent of saving a large fortune. The non-legal Peers cannot administer justice ; the legal Peers are few in number and advanced in age. The House is closed for three months of the legal year, and might be closed to the suitors altogether without any' loss to the suitors. A court of appeal, unless stronger and abler than the Court appealed from, is a heavy and cruel oppression, a cause of delay and expense incurred only to give the worse reason a chance of triumphing over the better. The matter, therefore, comes to this-that there is no chance of reforming the Judicial Tribunal of the House of Lords from within, and the question arises whether it should be abolished altogether. This latter remedy would, indeed, be preferable to existing abuses, but would be liable to grave objections. Th*e constitution of the Exchequer Chamher is by no rmeans perfect, the administration of equity would suffer much' from want of a Court of Appeal, and the law of Scotland would probsbly b he far more technical and narrow in its principles than it is had it been left to'the exclusive interpretation of Scotch expositors. Is there, then, no remedy, and must we give up in sheer despair our highest tribunal because its members will not let us reform it by an exercise of the prerogative?. We think not. We believe that ancient precedent and modern practice combine to point out a simple and satisfactory solution of the difficulty. The House of Lords and the Privy Council are, it appears, ouly two branches from the same stockthe ordinary or lesser Council of the BING. Both have inherited judicial powers, but, while the House of Lords has insisted on exercising those powers itself, the Privy Council has delegated them, with great advantage to tho public, and without any loss of dignity or consideration to itself, to the Judicial Committee. Such, it appears, was anciently the practice of the Lords, who were aided by a Court of Assistants, which heard the arguments and pronounced judgment in the name of the SoVEnm3h and the Peers. This useful tribunal gradually fell into desuetude, and the Peers, by successive encroachments, made themselves masters, after the IBestoration, of the appellate jurisdiction of courts of equity, and of the right of reviewingthe decisions of the Scottish Court of Session. From that time to the present they have exercised this jurisdiction with a dissatisfaction gradually increasing as the public has become more enlightened, till it has reached its culminating point in the recent abortive attempt at correction by the establishment of a life peerage: Now, what would be easier than to return to the state of things which formerly existed in the House of Lords, and has for the last 20 years prevailed in the Privy Council ? Let there be formed by act of Parlianwent a Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, consisting partly of such members of the House as are skdlled in law, together with such other judges as may be necessary to give the Court the requisite strength, who might bear the title of " Lord," andbe members of the House in its judicial capacity, without being created Lords of Parliament. Something must be done, and we can imagine nothing more likely to extricate us from our present embarrassment without injury to the Peerage than such a proposition. It is of no use to lament past errors. Whatever be the faults that the Peers have committed they arean essential part of the constitution, and it becomes the nation to take more care of the dignity of their Order than they seem disposed to do themselves, under the guidance of rash and impetuous counsellors.
The first impression we receive from the Ca&No}LoR of the EXHQuER'S little Budget of Friday night is, that the calculation of war expenses is beyond the limit of the financial intellect. Sooner may we trust in MuRPnY or MIOORE to predict the weather in harvest, or the temperature of the ensuing winter, than rely on the figures of a Minister who tels us with exactness, even extending to odd shillings, what the cost of fleets and armies, transports and transport corps, will be for the next fourteen months. Sir ComEwrm LxEWIS comes before the House with confidence because he is only 4,000,0001. in the wrong, and when we consider from what a wilderness of blundering we only now begin to emerge we must allow he has cause for complacency. The statement referred only to the expenditure of the present year, or that which will end on the 31st of March next. It is preliminary to the great Budget which will provide resources for all that is being now executed with a view to the campaign of the ensuing summer. On the 20th of April last the CHA-NCoLLo of the ExcnEqux, in submitting the budget for the year, estimated the revenue, including new taxes, at 67,339,0001.; the loan was 16,000,0001., and there was an estimate for Exchequer supply bills to the amount of 3,000,0001. Thus the total estimated revenue was 86,339,0001. The expenditurewasthenestimatedat 81,999,0001. Thus there was an expected surplusof 4,400,0001. The revenue was s,ightly diminished by the abandonment of the intendedc stamp duty on bankers' checks, but, as may be supposed, excess of expenditure, rather than deficiency of income, overthrew the M1inister's calculations. Towards the end of the session certain suipplementary estimates for the military service were laid before the House amounting to 6,135,0001., maLing a total expenditure for the year of 88,034,0001. An additional grant of Exchequerbills and bonds to the extent of 4,000,0001. was then taken, making a total provision for the year of 90,139,0001. The increased expenditure amounting to 88,034,0001., there remained a surplus of 2,105,0001.; but this surplus was in a great measure required to restore the balances which had been assisted by bills chargeable on the revenue of the current year. The second statement therefore presented almost equal amounts of revenue and expenditure. As the end of the financial year is not distant, the CH"cLoL of the ExcnzQuLm is able to submit to the House r.n estimate of the probable income and expenditure. We learn from this table that the deficiency of income amounts to 1,600,0001. -the Customs falling short of the estimate by 850,0001., the Excise by no less than 1,061,0001., the property-tax, however, exceeding the estimate by 191,0001. On the other hand, the expenditure exceeds the estimate by 1,960,0001. The deficiency of income and the excess of expenditure make up a total deficiency of 3,560,0001. The deficiency in the Customs arises chiefly from the smaUl importation of sug,ar, in consequence of the limited production of the article; the fact that the Excise fell short by more than 1,000,0001. sterling is due to the insufficient produce of the duty on spirits. The main cause of this deficiency was the high price of corn during the present year. Wheat has been for some time above 7'5s., sometimes over 80s., ancd necessary wants have taken precedence of luxuries. The failure of the wine crops on the continent has also led to large exportations of British spirits, which, being exported from bond to foreign countries, have beon subject to no payment of duty. The excess of expenditure it is perfectly easy to understand. There were supplementary estimates for both Navy and Ordnance. Even the grant for army medals fell short by 80,0001. Sir G. Luwis gives a table comparing the eipenditure for the naval and military services during the last 22i months of war with such expenditure for a similar period during peace. For the one term the amount is 30,984,9551., for the other 74,549,3291. ; thus we learn that the difference between these sums, or 43,564,3741., is, " as nearly as can be'cealcu" lated, the precise sum which the contest ha3 " cost the country." Although we can hardly agree with the CHAiczEroi of the ExCBEQUER's political economy, or believe that the exact cost of armaments is the exact cost of war, we must yet feel gratified that the extra expenditure has been no more. Although 43,000,0001. may be a great sum, and seem somewhat disproportionate to the glory we have gained, yet it is by no means more than in commencing such a struggle we should have predicted as its cost. The tranquillity of Europe, the improvement of the Ottoman empire, the opening of vast regions to our unceasingly vigilant enterprise, may prove to have been the advantages purchased by these 43,000,0001. and the other sums which the war has cost us by the temporary depression of trade and industry. As it appears that vwe are something like 4,009,0001. poorer than was estimated in the last session of Parliament, the resolutions of the CHACzuoR of the EXCHEQUER were to restoro the finances of the country at the end of the present quarter to the position in which they would havo been if the Estimates submitted last session had been verified by the event. As the excess of expenditure and deficiency of revenue leave nearly that sum to be provided for, the resolutions were for raising 5,000,0001. for the service of the present quarter, and to meet the first demands of the new financial year. Twenty-three millions having been borrowed already, the new loan will have increased the debt of the country to 28,000,000Z. more than it was at the beginning of the war. Up to the present time it may be said, therefore, that out of the extra 43,000,0001. required for the war, we have paid 15,000,0001. by extra taxation, and 28,000,0001. by loans. This estimate, which gives about 8,000,0001. per annum as the increase of taxation borne without a murmur, shows what resources the country possesses, and how long a contest it could wage without exhaustion. On the whole, we cannot but acquiesce in the cheerful tone of the CHA CErnor of the ExCHEQUER, and rejoice that, all things considered, we have not done worse. If the war eiids here we shall be able to make up accounts with no heavy heart, and prepare for a new season of peace and prosperity.
Woe to the army that shal be marshalled as Mr. MoNossu marshaled the Arny Estimates on Friday evening. His array of figures was turned into a mob, fact and fiction flew about like masLs and dominoes at the Carnival, addition became subtraetion, and subtraction addition, arithmetfc was routed, and the ghost of CocWER dismayed. More than ordinary clearness was required; more than ordinary obscurity -was attained. Various members had complained that the estimates had been in their hands but a few hours, that they had not had the time necessary to study the numerous details, and that it was "rather sharp prac" tice" of Ministers to ask the votes at so short a notice. In spite of all entreaty the Government determined to proceed, and Mr.MoNsELL rose to throw light on the obscurities and explain the difficulties which were thus strongly felt. As hell grew murkier under the frown of its chief, thicker darkness settled over the House under the explanations of the Minister, mist was added to the darkness, what were molehills before loomed large as mountains through the gloom, confusion became worse confounded, and the end of all was, that after passing the first vote of the new Estimates Lord PAFmmsrTox was only too glad to postpone a consideration of the rest until Friday next. Mr. MoNsiL is more fit to deal with the affairs of the church militant than with those of the army. His oration, with all its confusions and inanities, is in the oratory of M,inisters what Balaklava was in their administration; the poverty of intellect that could give utterance to such an exposition being a fair type of the bewildered helplessness that entailed all the muddle which the Crimean Commissioners have so faithfuUly described. In themselves the Estimates are plain enough, but it is so impossible to get any idea of them out of Mr. MIoxsFL's explanations-in which they are as irrecoverably lost as needles are said to be in a ,bundle of hay-that, even though we repeat ourselves, it will not be ont of place to set them once more clearly before our readers. The one vote to which the House has agreed regards the number of men in the army, properly so called, which is 246,716, or an increase of 30,000 over the estimate of last year. For this large force a sum of 10,950,0001., or 1,600,0001. more than was last year required. Staff pay and allowances absorb 584,5541.; while the regimental pay and allowances come to 6,278,5761. It may be worth while to analyze this latter sum, of which 1,493,8781. belongs to officers, numbering 8,282, 563,6281. to noncommissioned officers, numbering 16,527, and 4,221,0691. to 214,294 rank and file. These items, however, donot make up the total of pay, therebeing extra allowancesfor brevet rank, for lengthof service, for good conduct, and various other cals, amounting in all to 290,8151. Agency demands 60,5001.; hospital expenses 186,0001., in which the horse mnedicines alone cost 2,0001.; for Divine service the sum proposed is 50,0001.; for the movement of troops, 180,0001.; this being quite irrespective of the estimate for the Land Transport Corps, which is 666,6001. If we compare these last two items with those of the previous estimates a remarkable difference wiU be observed, the Land Transport Corps only costing 223,6001., while in order to make up for its deficiencies 1,122,0001. was allotted to the movement of troops. The charge for the administration of martial law is 56,0001. ; for the dep8t battalions, 48,5681.; for recruiting, 453,1531., or 120,0001. less than last year; for the purchase of horses, 742,0001., or nearly double the sum of the previous estimates; for the TurLish Contingent, 300,0001. After giving these totals the estimates proceed in a series of papers to analyze them in great detail, showing how much is required for the general staff, for the Commissariat staff, for the medical stag at home, abroad, at the seat of war. The whole sum required for the home staff is 85,0001.; and for that of the army in the field 323,0001. We are also shown how much every regiment is to receive; how much every officer and man; how much all the individuals of any particular grade. Thus 178 colonels are put down for 175,0001.; 9,184 sergeants for 333,3001. TheLandTransport Corps numbers in all 24,000 men, 9,000 being European. The European portion, however, although so many thousands less numerons than the native, get 100,0001. more pay; they get 378,0001. The embodied Miitia numbers very little more than half the army-126,950 ; the sum required for it being 3,150,1291., or nearly 300,0001. less than in the previous estimates. The Volunteer Corps is 14,528 strong, and its pay is 88,0001. The Army Worls Corps is 3,470 strong, and requires 408,0001. The estimate for the War Department appears to be considerably less than by the last accounts; the decrease of expense, however, is only apparent, as postage to the amount of 60,0001. has been shifted to the civil estimates. The expense of " head-quarters," too, has in like manner increased, and now amounts to 22,7001., while the civil establishments have proportionably increased 111,0001., till they now require 514,0001.; the wages of artificers demanding 915,0001. more. The clothing of the troops is calculated at 1,830,0001.-an increase of 175,0001.; provisions at 2,268,0001.-an increase of I 340,0001.; forage at 4,862,0001.-an increase of nearly 3,500,0001. ; fuel and light at 428,0001.-an increase of 125,0001.; furniture at 370,0001.-or nearly 50 per cent. less; paillasso straw, 12,0001.-double the sum required last year. Under the head of Ordnance stores 1,000,0001. is required for the repair and supply of small-arms-an increase of 200,0001.; for the supply of iron ordnance, shot, shells, &c., 572,0001.-a decrease of 160,0001.; nearly 2,500,0001. -for saltpetre, gunpowder, timber, camp equipage, and miscellaneous stores; 211,0001. for the supply of waggons, harness, &c., to the Land Transport Corps; in a1 for this department, 4,370,0001. Besides which 2,000,0001. is required for new works and buUdings, Aldershott reqluring 230,0001., Woolwich 240,0001., ana the Militia- huts 250,0001. The educational and scientific branches of the service are to receive 238,0001., a considerable portion of which, however, amounting nearly to the odd 38,0001., is paid back to the Exchequer from the receipts of the military academies at Woolwich and Carshalton, wkhi.h are almost self-supporting. Evidently there has been no. stint in the preparations for war, and we have here a good illustration of the maxim, that it is impossible for England to wage a little war. Ministers entered into this conflict expecting it to be a little one, a short one-probably a mere sham. As cheap goods are the dearest in the end, a timid policy has cost us infinitely more than if we had at once launched out into the expenses of armaments even larger than the present ones, for it has cost us blood, it has cost us lives that taxes cannot replace, and endangered a reputation that no money can buy.
There is to be an end of the internecine warfare between the four great railway companies. The Great Northern, the North-Western, the Midland, ad the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincoln, have agreed to refer their differences to the impartial arbitrament of'3rr. GLDSTONE, the late Chancellor of the Exchequer. The ex-Minister some five years ago made an award under similar circumstances, which, if it has not satisfied every one, -ay at least, in fairness, be said to have given very general satisfaction. This is a result at which the public should rejoice, as well as the shareholders of the different companies, for it can never be the interest of the public that any one of these great coiporations should cease to prosper. No concern in the long run can afford to do business so cheaply as a thriving one. Any temporary abatement of price dependent upon the necessity' of defeating an opposition must in the end be followed by a corresponding rise. The shareholders must, and will in the end, make np their losses, aswell as replace their operations upon a correct basis. They must, in fact, be indemnified for every penny they have uselessly spent during the abnormal period of mad competition. The passengers who rejoice that they can now run down to Leeds for 5s., or to Peterborough for 2s., may feel very sure that when the period of opposition fares is 'at an end they will be compelled to reimburse to the company in some form or other every penny they now appear to have saved. This is, in other words, to say that, in the long run, the railways must be worked at a profit, and not at a loss. Great inconvenience may, no doubt, result to the shareholders in the meanwhile, and many who had placed their money in the concern as a permanent investment will suffer great inconvenience. Sellers will be many-buyers, save on speculation, will be few, and altogether the great lines of communication throughout the country will be affected with the taint of jobbery. This cannot be a wholesome state of things, and therefore we ought all to rejoice that good sense has prevailed, and that the chairmen and directors of the four companies have perceived in time that the interest of their constituents is best consulted by compromise and reciprocal concession. A scheme of a traffic arrangement, which is to be binding for 14 years, istobe submitted to Mr. GLADSTONE, and his award is to be final for the period named. It was at the meeting of the proprietors of the Great Northern line, held on Satturday at the London Tavern, that the opening of the RailwayPeace Conferences was announced. The proposition to which we have just referred was first proposed to a deputation from the other companies, and by them rejected. After a little time for consideration better counsels, however, prevailed, and the original proposition of the Great Northern directors was returned to them as the basis of a settlement by the very persons who had previously rejected it. When the measure was laid on Saturday before the general meeting for their approval or rejection, it was carried by acclamation, followed "by long "and enthusiastic cheering." Thus far, then, the matter is in good train, and there is every reason to believe that the three other companies are quite as much in earnest as the Great Northern. It is only from compromises of this kind that any safety or stability can be looked for in our English system of railway property. There must either be Parliamentary control, or competition for all practical purposes inchecked. With us the latter system has prevailed, and, whether for good or for evil, we must accept it with all its consequences, and the good sense of the shareholders must supply the place of legislative check or controL A district which is traversed by two, three, or four competing lines must be worked, in fact, as though the lines were but one concern. Opposition begets opposition, to the detriment of all the competing parties, until they are driven in the end to do that which they might just as well have done in the first instance-namely, accept the decision of an impartial arbitrator, and a scheme for conducting their traffic which shall offer equal advantages to alL The pity is that the same principle has not been applied to the allotment and construction of lines as to their working. A district must be preoccupied. The directors of lines which appear to be remote enough from the scene of action rush into mad contest. Branches are formed long before the districts upon which they are thrust are really ripe for their reception, and the trunk lines are bled that the useless suckers may flourish. It is most unfortunate that some form of arbitration could not be applied to these ruinous contests for priority of occupation, as wellas to the strugglesfor the monopoly of traffic when the Enes have been once formea. Before concluding our few remarks upon this very important subject we would draw attention to the financial result from the reduction of fares in the recent instance of the Great Northern. It appears that during the first week of the cheap trains 5 56 persons were booked from Doncaster to London-the total receipts being 1041. 2s. During the week ending on Saturday last there were 775 passengers booked as before-the total receipts being 1461. ls.; total for the two weeks 2501. 19s. Before the period of the competition the same station produced as the result of its London traffic about 601., the number of passengers being, on the average, 40. Of cours3, on glancing at arithmetical results of this kind, the expense of extra trains, additional staff, wear and tear of the line, &-c., must be taken into account ; still, on the whole, do not the calculations seem to show that upon a system of far cheaper fares the railway traffic mightbe made much more productive to the shareholders ? The custom of more frequient travelling would beget the necessity for it. If such results were obtained in a fortnight, what might not a year'produce? If this contest tends to prove that cheap fares are not inconsistent with good dividends, both the public and the shareholders will have no reason to regret it.

ADBLPHI THEA TR. On Saturday afternoon Ber 31ajesty paid her first viit to this theatre to witness the pantomime, Jack and the Bean Stak. The performance was exlusively for the amusement of tho Royal family, and such of the nobility and gentry as are attached to the Court. The centre of the dress circle was converted for the occasion into one large Royal box, the arms being placed in the middle panel, nd the draperies being festooned ulp with crowvns and other devices in gold, and vwith gold and criroson cords and tasseinls oreover, the boxc was decorated with crimsonL velvet, gold, and white sil in the most costly style, the passages were lined with velvet, and the floors and passages were covered with crimson cloth. At the conclusion of the performance -Her MIajesty is said to have expressed to lir. Webster the gratification slie had received. She vwas enthusiasticaliy cheered when she quitted the theatre.
FEES TO BOXEEPEBS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T3IEwS. Sir,-I hope you will give publicity to the following imu position upon the public, the truth of which can, I am sure, be attested by many fellow-snfferers. Last night, accompanied by a friend, I visited Covent-garden Theatre, and paid for seats in the dress balcony. Upon tendering our checks to the box-.ceper we were informed that there were no seats, but that we might have standing room. In the lobby were many in the same predicament, a few of whom, by significant gestures tothe Cerberns ofthe boxes, were accommodated with seats. As we, however, obstinately kept our fingers out of our waistcoat pockets, there was, of course, no chance for us. We then requested that our money might be returned, but this was refused; the moneytaker had no orders to refund. This being the case, after standing till tired, we returned home disgusted, feeling that our only recourse lay in an appeal to your columns as to the fairness of managers of theatres taln more money than they can give an adequate remuneration for. Such a system does not exist (out ofEngland) in any theatre in Europe. I remain yours obedientlv. Army and Nary Clnb, Pall-mal% Feb. 23. R. L-EE. A Cabinet Council was held. on Saturday aftemoon at the Foreign-office.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES OFFICE, Monday.1fMorning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correipondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. The important moment when the great question tf peace or war is to be decided is rapidly approachIng. The Conferences open to-morrow at 1 o'clock precisely-on the day (the 25th), and in the place (the official residence of the Minister for Foreign 6ffairs) which I announced to you weeks ago. In Consideration of the momentous subject which will Lave to be discussed, every moral and material preCaution will be taken to prevent what posses in the tongress being prematurely disclosed to the world. Doors and windows are to be closed, people sent DlIt of earshot; the very air itself, which might baear to the profane the slightest whlisper of a secret, WMl be almost excluded, and thick blinds wiU shut out from that varied conclave any chanice simbeam that would obtrude its light on their deliberations. During this anxious period the inventive powers of 3eiwsniongcrs will be taxed to the utmost, and it loould not be difficult to indicate even now the particular channels throught which imaginary debates Wil be given to the world. Of course all these tvill be received vith caution, when it is known that the strongest obligation has been imposed and acCepted reciprocally to say nothing which would be likely to endanger the tranquil course of the Conlerences, or to reveal before the proper time the testult that may be arrived at. As the deliberations have not yet commenced, I owever, I may profit by the interval to say a word relativeto the formn in which they wiU be carried on. The sitting of to-morrow wiUl probably be occupied for the greater part, if not entirely, with the verification of powers of the Plenipotentiaries; after tvhich, it is said, that the President of the Congress, that is, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, will present a communication in the name and on behalf Df the allies, containing in precise terms the conditions on which they will agree to make peace with Pcussia. These conditions will be discussed, and Uny objections offered to thene answered. In the communication thus presented the stipulations Df the preliminary convention of peace wiU be so Clearly put as to admit of no doubt or of no misapprehcnsion asto the definitive conditions of peace. T lnderstand also that the Russian Plenipotentiaries will have to make their communications in writing. The process would perhaps be tedious in negotiations of a complicated charactar-no such character, how ever, belongs to those unider consideration ; nothing Can be plainer than what we demand, and nothing Ought to be plainer or more brief than the reply, whethernegative oraffirmuative. Bythismodeof acting the Plenipotentiaries of Russia, if it be true that they iave come furnished w ith full powers to deliberate 2nd decide, will not be under the necessity of having recourse to that hackneyed trick of diplomacy, the referring home for fturther instructions. This plan Uill, in reality, be more expeditious than any other, and, if it be carried out in the manner I state, we ought to be able to give a fair guess, after the first eight or ten da ys' sitting, as to what the result will be. Tle sittings of the Congress will not take place consecutively day after day. In some few cases it 3nay be so, but such is not the present intention. The number of times in the week that the Plenipotentiaries wilr meet for despatch of-business is not fixed; it may be three or four times, or oftener, and three days or more may elapse between two sittings; but this will depend a good deal on cir- cumstances. A wt ord or two about Prussia will not be out of p'ace here. I learn from two excellent sources, one confirming the other, that that Power has novw at least a chance, I may say certainty, of taking a part, thoug.i not immediately, in the business of the Congress. She positively declares that she has decided on accepting the " principles and obligations of Austria in the Eastern question," and she awaits the moment for Austria to facilitate her admission to the Conferences-a privilege which Austria has Vledged herself to obtain for her. Iam unwilling to discourage the hopes of peace that may be entertained by a great portion of the public, either in England or France, or to excite exagger.ated expectations of its being easily and speedily ealized. I have long ago expressed an apprehenSion that the object of the Conferences was likely to be seriously interfered with, if not imperiUled by the indiscreet, and I must say, undignified and sunnanly songs of tritumph chanted by the French press. In the idurnals thait are mnore Russian than national, end that seemed to prefer Russian honour to the honour of their own country, there might be some excuse. But for that part of the press which is sutpposed to be more or less under the inspiration of the Government to wlhose care the honour of the nation is for the moment confided, to exhibit an unseemly exultation whicl would hardlybe witnessed in a Power reduced by a long and desolating war to the verge of ruin, is incomprehensible. Such nongs of triumph could only be interpreted 2nf one sense by Russia, namely, that the French people execrated the war, and were ready to accept any conditions, however onerous, that afforded a prospect of peace. If Russia show herself obstinate in the coursd of the Conferences I have the moral certainty that it is traceable to the cause I have indicated. It was stated the other day, on the authority of a person usuaLlywellinformed,-that one great difficilty had been removed in the renunciation by Russia of Wicholaieff, and the statement has been since corroborated by a3Iinisterialjolimal. Ifear,however, from something which transpired yesterday that this statemeut is premature, and that this -point also will lhve to be discussed by the Congress. Under all circumstances it will be well to abstain from pronotmcing that peace is certain, or the contrary. Out of a hundred chances by farthe greater part are in favour of a pacific solution; but I cannot conceal from myself the fact that all are not so yet. The best thing we can do is to maintain the posi tion we have taken up. Ve need not be arrogant -or overbearing, but there never was a greater necessity for firmness and *ulion between the aUies; and I have no good ground for believing, whatever suspicions may have existed to the contrary, that England, France, and Austria wvill be wanting in either. I Count Orloff, w-hose arrival I have already an0ounced, had his audience of the Emperor, having had previously an interview wvith the 31inister for Foreignl Affairs; and Aali Pasha, who arrived the night before last, was received this day, at 2 o'clock, by His Majesty. Count Buol is the bearer of an Austrian decoration, the Croix iWigee, from the Emperor Francis Joseph to the Empress Eugenie. The decoration, like the Spanish one of ! laria Luisa, is exclusively conferred on ladies (les pctit,s cade4zx, enfetienlent l'amitie). It is further said that an Austrian Archduke will come- to Paris to represent tho Emperor of Austlia at the baptism of the future heir to the throne of France. This inteigence, though comnrunicated in a private letter from Munnich, emanating fronm a good source, I do not Touch for. The account of the affair as between the .Si7e, Cowi.tift(itionail, and Monitem;, which I gave on FridaY, has been coiinired this day in every important' relpect. There was, however, no resigna- tion, nor intimation of sueh, on the part of any of the Ministers. No diisension has been occasioned by it, and I am assured on good autho_ rity, that at no period since the commencement of the important questions which have soon to be resolved, have the Government been more united than at this moment. I think it right also to add that the error as to date of the Mlinister of State was involuntary. It was the article of the Si&ckt replying to The Times that the Emperor wished to have published in the Moniteur, and not the one referring to the " nationalities " and in reply to the Journat des D¶ba&.s; The saloons of the British Embassy were crowded last light-Saturday being substituted for Thursday for Lady Cowley's receptions. It was expected that the Plenipotentiaries would be there; and as you may suppose, there was great curiosity to see the men on whom so weighty a responsibility as the peace of Europe rests. Count Buol, Count Cavour, Baron Brunow, and Lord Clarendon were present, and remained some time. AL Brunow entered rather late. As a matter of course, their every act, their every look was observed, and from the placid smile of Count Bnol, or the peculiar style in which Baron Brunow wore his cravat, inferences were drawn as to the probabilities of peace or war. I believe Cotnt Orloff did not make his appearance. Tha following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- "MARPSEILLES, FEe. 23. "The Thabor has arrived, with accounts from Constantinople of the 14th inst. That capital was on the eve of a financial and commercial crisis The price of goods had considerably fallen, and transactions were thereby totally para lyzed. Meat and flour had dnminished by one-half, sold by wholesale, but the retail prices continued as hi6gh as ever." " The pubUc, the journals, and merchants, loudly demanded the establishment of a bank, in order to reduce the difference of exchange between the Turkish and foreign coins, wvhich alrcady lost from 15 to 20 per cent. The Divan had not yet replied to ML de lothschild's proposition. "A disease among cattle was extending its ravages all over the empire. " The Hatti-scherif, regulating the position of tho Chris tianis, was being translated into several languages, and wilI soon be published. "L Letters from the Crimea of the 10th inst. state that the de,'arture of Marshal Pelissiei for France was talked of. General Matimiprey, Chiefof the Staffof theEastern army, had returned from his joumney to France. The northern fort continued to fire upon Sebastopol. The gunboats stationed at Kiahurn had arrived at Kamiesch to undergo repairs. The English anny ardently desired the continuation of the war. " An order of the day, issued by General Codrington, at Balaklava, recommended the English officers to provide themselves with the articles of equipment necessary for a forward movement. " It was believed that Mir. Murray had proceeded to Eagdad. " Ismael Pasha had been sent to Asia to replace Omar Pasha, who will probably be superseded in the command of the army." ""MADRID, FEB. 22. "The. report in circulation for some days, that the Great Central Company was not to bid for the Madrid and Sarragossa Railway, has been contradicted. It is stated, on the contrary,,that the propositions of theCompanyarecalculated to secure to it a preference over its competitors. Nine of the Directors of the Bank of Credit Mobilier are Spaniards." The steam frigate Montezuma left Toulon, for Kamiesch, on the 23d inst., with a cargo of provisions and war maU id. The Mon-iteur publishes the returns of the produce and consumption of beetroot sugar since the commencement of the season, from which it appears that on the 1st inst. there were 274 manufactories in full operation, or 66 more than at the corTesponding date of 1855. The quantity of sugar manufactured, including 2,359,141 kilogrammes lyingover since last year, amounts to 71,375,189 kilogrammes, being a difference in favour of 1856 of 26,009,402 kilogramaes; and that sold for constumption or deposited in the Government bonding stores is set down at 53,527,920 kilogrammes, or 24,698,294 more than last year. THE' ARMY IN THE CRIMEA. (ERomr OUR OWN- COP.rsPONDEUT.) CAMP BEFORE SEBASTOPOIS FEB. 11. The sole incident that has occurred here since my letter of the 9th is the destruction of Fort Alexander, which was blown up, in three explosions, at 1 o'clock this afternoon. The destruction was very complete, but the place does not look such a perfect level as the site of Fort Nicholas, and the sea face has been intentionally left standing. The explosions were the loudest we have heard this year, especially the first of the three. The day was dry but not bright, and the absence of sun detracted from the striking nature of the spectacle, which was, however, sufliciently imposing, but not equal to that of Fort Wicholas's downfall. Notwithstanding the distance, the explosions sounded very loud up in camp, and persons who were well in rear of Catheart's-hill assure me that they felt the ground tremble, and the huts they were in seemed to rock. The Russians, who had been firing a little from the Inkermann Batteries just before the fort blew up, were perfectly silent for some time after the explosion, apparently thinking it more dignified camly to contemplate the destruction of their fortresses than to exhibit impotent wrath and unprofitably to expend their ammunition. At a later period of the day they fired more than usual from the north side. In the Karabelnaia our engineers continue to amuse themselves, and small explosions are not unfrequent. Tkis- afternoon, the White Buildings, as they are generally called, adjoining the dockyard, were partly on fire. The question of peace or war is still the one engrossing topic which occupies all minds and comes uppermost in most conversations. Every post is looked for with the most intense anxiety, and thousands of tines daily is the question asked " When shall we know positively whether this year will witness a bloody campaign or a peaceful return home ?" The camp is divided into the peace party and the war party, each predicting in accordance with its wishes. The ambitious, the needy, those who think that another six months of war wil give them the promotion they may await for years, if peace be made, those whose sole patrimony is their sword, and those born soldiers who love war for war's sake, are full of fight, and adduce the most cogent arguments in favour of a continuation of hostilities. It is curious to hear the diametrically opposite opinions that are emitted:l "Peace is certain, we shall al be home in a few weeks," is the assuranceyou receive fiom officers who did not enter the army to fight, and whom honour alone, and no taste for the work, has brought and kept so long out here. "The Russians are only trying to ain time?," says the next man you meet, a thorough soldier, to whom hardship and danger are as nothing, and who covets promotion and the higher pay it *ill bring, for he has a wife and children at -home, and little but his pay to maintain them with; "the report of peace is all humbug. See yonder, they are erecting platforms in Balaklava harboiur, to ship the troops to Asia." Each man sees through his own glasses. The platform would serve equally well to ship troops toEngland. Among the mercantile community in the Crimea, the vendors of wines and spirits, sauces; pickles, preserves, biscuits, tea, coffee, hnams, crockery, butter, cheese, and a multitude of other groceries and Italian warehoiiseries, great alarm has been spread by the announcement of probable peace. Forgetting their enormous past profits, they think only of their approaching los3. As far as concerns the English dealers and sua'lers at Kadikoi and Donnybrook, and a few -isolated shops scattered through the camp, their case does not call for, nor is likely to excite, much commiseration. With very rare exceptions they have sold bad things at exorbitant prices. At Kamniesch the French reckon on getting rid of their good qualities of wine to the Russians, but there is an immense quantity of fin ordinaire (most of it extremely ordinuaire and rather logwoody), concerning the disposal of which they are very uneasy, since they know the Russians to be too good judges to buy it, and they fear they will be obliged to incur the expense of shipping it to Constantinople, where they hope to find customers for it among the principal hotelkeepers, -who will bottle it, put seals on the corks and labels on the glass, and retail it at 6f. or 8f. the bottle, as the choicest produce of Burgundy and Bordeaux vineyards, sacking, with that peculiar calmness and complacency which are characteristics of your thorough-bred Constantinople innkeeper, some 500 per cent. profit, and grumbling the while at the hardness of the times. The half-yearly inspections continue. To-day the 48th and G8th were inspected and reviewed on Cathcart's-hill. They turned out extremely well, went through some evolutions in a highly creditable manner, and gave perfect satisfaction to General Garrett. I l:ave accounts from Kertch, but no later than the 1st inst. The Weser gunboat had been on a reconnaissance inito the Sea of Azoff. At Arabat mortar batteries had been erected pointing seawards, but nothing was seen of the hosts of Russians reported to be in the vicinity, and the Tartars said there were only 12,000 in those parts. The post from Constantinople, due this morning, has not arrived. The weather continues mnild and fine, and the groumd is drying up. TUESDAY, FEB. 12. I have nothing to add to the above, except information of the opening of the New Theatre Royal, Fourth Dhinsion, which took place last night, when John1 Dobbs and Going to the Derby were perfonied to an admiring audience of about 300 soldiers and non-commissioned officers. There has been rain in the night, but it is now fine and remarkably mild. It is 9 a.m. and the thermometer stands at 470 out of doors. TURKEY. (FRom oun OWN coRnEsroNDmN-r.) CONSTANTINOPLE, FEB. 14. For the last few days the rtumoiur has been current that Omar Pasha was coming to Constantinople, and that he had already sent his baggage before him. Some interpreted this rtmour as a recall, others as a wish on his side to regain the lost ground at the Porte. The real state of the case is that he sent in, for the 999th time, his resignation, with the clause, as usual, that he would only remain with the army if certain conditions, which he had long ago urged, should be complied with. These conditions have reference to his position with regard to the Seraskierate, or Ministry of War, with which helms had a standing feud, no matter what person was at the head of it. Quarrels between Commanders-in-Chief and War Departments, however dangerous, are nearly always sure to arise in case of ill-success; but with Omar Pasha it is a chronic disease. No man ever had fuller powers, if he chose to use them, thian the Sirdar Ekrem possessed when at the head of the army of RoLumelia, with the revenues of several provinces assigned to him, and even the power to issue paper money, and yet the Archives of Stamboul teem with his lamentations, which would be difficult to understand were it not for the solution which he himself proposes. This solution consists in his being Commander-in-Chief and Seraskier at the same time, and then his naming a kaimakan, or lieutenant in his place, while he was with the army. Unfortunalely this solution is by no means to the taste of the Government here. He has therefore received ordersto remain where he is, especially as letters lately received from Sugdid.i report that General Bruinner, who has replaced Bagration Moukhransky, the late Russian Commander in Minogrelia, was collecting his formcs and threatening the Turkish position. MIost of the baggage which has actually arrived consists of the furniture found in the palace of the Princess Dadian at Sugdidi, and valued at several thousand pounds sterling. When the Turks reached this latter place Omar Pasha ordered that the furniture should be removed to a church out of the palace, which Skender Pasha converted into a blockhouse. The latter, with his usual energy and honesty, had everything removed and sentries placed over the church; so nothing was lost, and the whole furniture has now been removed by the orders of Omar Pasha. The French Consul at Suchum-Kaleh has made a report about the affair, whicli has made a great deal of noise in the country. Besides this, there is likewise a complaint. lodged against Omar Pasha by Coumt Rosemaduque, a French subject, long established in MUingrelia. He had established a silk manufactory in the country, and was in continual relation with the Princess Dadian. WVhen the Turks passed the Ingour he was with the Russians, having found no opportunity to come where his inclination lay. Finally, towards the end of the month of Nlovember, he rejoined Omar Pasha's arnmy, and gave some valuable information about the state of the country people as well as of the Russians. Omar Pasha promised to make such arrangements that his property should be respected; but despite of this promise, he complains now, as a French subject, against him for having allowed his property to be pillaged. The fall in the exchange is still continuing; yesterday it reached 12C piastres for the pound sterling, and the French napoleon at 98. It is, however, only felt in wholesale transactions. The retail market has not been affected at all. Thus, for instance, according to the Journal de Coizstaitbiwple, the beef and mutton, which until lately have been sold on the animal at 5;f. the ocka are now at 31f., and yet in retail they still cost 12f. 15c. the ocka. Flour, vwhich cost 9f. the ocka, has likewise fallen to 4-kf., and yet the price of bread has not been affected. Similarly in all other things. The Crimean mail has come in this morning, at 9 o'clock, bringing news up to the 12th inst. General Shirley returned from Shumla on Tuesday last. Brigadier-Genelml Watt retains the command until further orders. An accident of a very selious character happened to one of the Bashi-Bazouk squadrons. They were quartered, men and horses, in a wooden shed; the Bashis, who seemed to have forgotten, if' they ever knew anything about, the laws of gravitation, were in the habit of cutting out pieces of timber from the sides of the shed, and of using them for firewood; the consequence was, that one fine morning the shed came down over their heads, killing eight and wounding 11 men, and killing and wounding 42 horses. The first idea whichtook hold of theircomrades outside vwas that some diabolical scheme had been devised by the Inglis to make short work of them, and they began to look for their pistols, but whhen they saw that the officers, who had hastened to the spot, threw off their coats and began to work to get out of the ruins what was to be saved, they laid on. hard too, and worked with a zeal quite!astonishing in them. The only thing to be regretted is that the officers did not look before to the state in which the sheds were. This has now been ordered. -AUSTR.A. (FROM OUR OWN' CoRRsPoNDEN-T.) VIENNA, FXB. 20. The news, received from Paris, that the Porte will insist on the destruction of the dockyards of .Nicholaieff, has caused some little tribulation here, aund this "new caprice" of the Turkish Gover. metit is attributed to' that " everlasting agitator" Lord Redcliffe. You will doubtless ere this have learned by the Moieifeur that the Empress of the Frenchhas received the order of theStarCross(Stern KreACz Orden) anda letter from the Empress-Mother, 'Caroline Augusta, but the official organ wil hardly publiih the Impelial epistle, although it must have made an extremely agreeable impression on the Emperor Napoleon. You have frequently been told that the relations between France and Austria were far more intimate than was generally supposed, and the information which will now be given is well calculated to remove aU doubt on the subject. When it was settled that Count Buol shoulld go to Paris, His Mlajesty the Emperor wished to give his brother MIonarch some striking proof of the high consideration in f ihich he held him, and it was thought that this could not be better done< than by treating his consort as if she had been of Imperial or Royal descent.* The. " 8ttern-Krce" is only worn by those ladies whose pedigree has during a]ong series of yearn been without spot or blemish, and it was resolved that this high order should be presented to the Empress of the French. In order that the impression'produced on theo Imperial pair might be the mtore agreeable, the badge of the order in brilliants was accompanied by a letter from the :Empress Caroline Augusta, who is Protectress and Superior of the Institution, in which it is said-that the attention has been shown "in order to consolidate the intimiate relations already subsisting between the twof amilies." The other parts of the letter wvere of little moment, but the passage quoted appears most signiufcant, when it is considered that it -was written at the express desire of the Emperor Francis Joseph. The imnoderate zeal of the Italian bishops is a source of extreme annoyance to the Anchbishop of Vinnia, who is a good Austrian, althougha ditifulsoR of the Churchl, andhe is said to fearthatthe behaviour of his bretlhren in Lombardy and Venice will excite the suspicions of this Government. The Bishop of Bergamo and the other Italian prelates have already caUed in to their aid some talented young priests from the Propazanda at Rome, and it is a notorious fact that most of the persons brought u1p in the inlstitutioii in question entertain ideas relative to Italy which are not in favour at this' Court. Mazzini and his friends woould fain see all the Italian States united upder one President, but there is a powerfil party, vwhich las its head quarters at Rome, whose aim it is to place the whole peninsula under the sceptre of the Pope. Tbat this last faction has no chance of success need hardly be said, but stil its agitation will contribute to keep iip the ferment which is going on in Italy. The Contc Albani, tle Podesta of Bergamo, who, by the by, is a most zealous Catholic, has come to Vieina in order to call the attention of the Government to the evil consequences which are likely to arise from the strange condtict of the Bishop of the see. The excitement is general and great, as the people are well aware that the civil po-wer never intended that the so-callcd " preventive censure" should be introduced by the priesthood. The excitement has greatly suibsided in Bohemia, where the bishops proceed with extreme caution. The pastoral letters of the Hun,garian prelates are in. a tolerant spirit, excepting one which was published by the Bishop of Temesvar. The Archbishop of Agrarn has also displayed a most conciliatory spirit, and wveU it is for the State that he has done so, as one-third of the population of Croatia and Slavonia belongs to the schismatic Greek or Russian Church. As Sir Hamilton Seyniour has been unable to find a suitable house or apartments, lie has been living wmith his family in an h3tel, -where he has made the most unpleasant discovery that his goods and chattels are not in safety. A few night3 since some one entered his room, and carried off all his linen, with the exception of one shirt, one pair of stockings, and one pocket handkerchief. It muist be supposed the malefactor was disturbed, his operations, as the writing desks, containing State papers, money, &c. ,were untouched. WVhen Governmcnt has leisuire to tlhink of such matters, it would, perhaps, do well eitlher to prchase a house here, or to take one for a series of years, as a Vienna hotel is no fitting place for a man in whose keeping are State secrets. It is not necessary to say muore on this subject, but very singular and authentic stories might be related if prmdence did not bid me stay my pen. For a long time a Riusian prince, -with a pollysyllabic name, which has escaped iny memory, had the very next room to that which served the British Minister for his salon de reccptiomc, and it is highly probable he heard a great part of what was said, as Vienna doors are by no means remarkable for their thickness, or for being good fits. *The Gennan word ebenbaArtig, literally tranwlated, mealis "' of equal birth."

AMERICA. (BY ELxcruo TELEGRATH.) ITVERPOOL FAa. 24. The Arabia has arrived with advices from New York to the 12th. She has-brought no specie. The Union had arrived at New York on the 7th. .Tho Persia arrived at New York on the 9th inst., after a very-boisterous passage of 14 days, from Liverpool. In lat. 46, long. 46, she encountered heavy gales and: fields of ice, which detained her 36 hours. About one-third of her paddle-floats were carried:away, and the huge iron bars which coinposed the fiame were turned up and twisted as if they had been pasteboard. The serew steamship Canadian, from Greenock, had arrived at Boston. The Pacific, which left Liverpool on the 23d ult., had not arrived at New York; it was believed in that city that her non-arrival was caused by the ice. Mr. Collins had despatehed the steamer Alabama, with a large quantity of provisions and clothing on board, in search of the Pacific, and for the purpose also of conveying relief to other vessels presumed to be detained inthe ice in the vicinity of Newfoundland. Lieutenant Hartstein, of the United States' steamer Arctic, had also started on a similar errand on receipt of orders from the Secretary of the Navy. - In the Senate a motion had been made by Mr. Cass for an increase of the navy; the Secretary-of-War w.as requested to. report whether any, and, if so, what additional fortifications were necessary for the defence of New York and Brooklyn Navy-yards. The debate on the Central American question was resumed y Mir. Wilson, wlho said,- *' He gave little heed to the apprehension of war with England; merchants continued their trading vwithout any suncl fears; it was not very probable the Esecntira desired a war which would estend from the bolndaries of that country to the shores of the- Polar Sea, gazed at by Dr. Kane. The only result attained by tho Clayton-Bulwer Treaty h3d been a prolific correspondence and an intarminable discussion, wlich had settled no point in dispute and led to no restult. Tho treaty had not accomplished what thepeople of this country expeoted. He thought this Government had been orer.eached in negotiation, and that the United States ought at once to declare it null and void, and stand then just as they stood before it was made. 'The course of Great Britain justified us in abroating the treaty altogether. We need not fear her in Central America, let her send as many Anglo-S,a-ons there as she pleased. No doubt they would miake good citizens of tlis country when we hereafter came into possession there." Mr. Ma=on thought that the discussion of the subject rather embarrassed than aided the solution of the difficulties surroundiEng it. Mr.. Butler dlid not look on this question as likely to issue in a wvar w ith Great Britain. He concurred in the American interpretation of the treaty, but hoped the matter would be referred to the Committee on Foieigni Relations, instead of being fiuther discissed in the Senate. MIr. Foot said Mr. Clayton wished to be heard, but was detained by indisposition. He moved a postponemeint of the subject to Monday, which was agreed to. The Washington correspondentof the Courie-r nnd En qairer says,- "Tlhe despatches from the British Cabinet to their Minister are zsaivl to be pacific and cordial towards the United States, anid to be of such a character as ought to dissipate the slightest shade of doubt that any difficulty endangerinthe peace of the two natious can grow out of the Central American questions, It is astonishing howv coldly the public receive all belligerent demonstrations on threse interruptions to the evell Pnev of British and American diplomacy. The difscussion in the Senate, illustrated as it has been by the learning, ability, and elouence of the leading members of the body-dessrs. Seward, Clayton, Cass, and Foot-has not even arre.ted public attention. No one seems to care what the President or any of the war party in Congress have said or may say on the British question. Nobody understands why tlsere is or how there can be any, and the reason, probably, is thas mnst of our grown-up population remember the wretched farce of 54' 40, or fight." General Cass had fract-ured one of his arms by falling dowrn the steps of the Patent-office. Mr. Mfarcy continued to decline receiving the credentials of Colonel French as Nicaraguan Minister. The Legislature of Texas had passed a bill accepting from the Government $7,750,000 in full payment of the Texan debt. The money goes to the crelitors of the State. About -one-half of the $3,000,000 due to the MAexican Governiment, which had been advanced to Santa Anna by certain capitalists of New York, hal been paid to Hargrove and Co. and Howvland and AspinalL The Irish re3idents of Cincinnati had had a demonstration in honour of the Filibusters acquitted of an intention to invade Ireland. Much by-talk was indulged in, and, in case of a war between Englaid and the United States, 160,000 Irish-JAmerican bayonets were promised. About 300 very poverty-stricken looking persons had sailed for Pqlnta Arenas, to join Walker in Nicaragua, withotit hindrance from the Government. Tne Neso York} Herald, in a leading article on Central Aimierican affairs, says that ni the treaty between Sir H. L. Binlwer and Mlr. Clayton the former completely outwitted the latter. The Alabaama State Convention had passed a resolution denving the right of Congress to legislate on the subject of slavery. The President had issued another message on the subject of the disturbances in Kansas, callmig [upon all peaceably-disposed persons to support tlle laws, ana admonishing citizens of adjoining or distant States to abstain from unauthorized intermeddling in the local contcerns of the-territory. The New York commercial advices report that on the 11th inst. the excitement and activity in Wallstreet had been greater than known for years past. Crowds collected in all the brokers' offices long before the adjournment of the board, auxious to get the first intelligence of prices and sales. Outside orders to buy were poured in with great rapidity, and orders " Withdraw my stocks from the market' were plenty enough among the brokers. The market on the following day closed heavy and quiet. The.money-market was abundantly supplied. The bank returns for the past week show a sli.ght increase in cash. Foreign exchanges were in brisk demand, and bankers were realizing higher rates. There are but few first-class houses drawing sterling bills below 109.

The steamer Northern Lightleft San Juanonthe 5thfor New York with $350,000 in gold in freight. The news from California is not important. The accounts from the mmies continued encouraging. The markets were unchanged. The bark Isabella Heyne was wrecked on the 8th, and the captain and mate lost. The vessel and cargo were a total loss. Affairs at Nicaragua were quiet. The Government had suspended its relations with Colonel Wheeler, the Uinited States' Minister. More fiLhting had taken place between the volunteers and the Indians at Wallawalfa, Orecon. 23 of the troops were killed and wounded. Z L&EIBY TELEGRAFH, VIA IL&IAX. IIEW YORK, FE 14, EVENeG.

THE DEBATE ON LIFE PEERAGES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to caUl your attention to an accidental error in your report of the debate on Lord Glenel.s motion. In referring to Lord Campbell's admission that it was in the poirer of the Crown to create a peerage for life, although that peerage wvould not give a right to sit or vote in Parliament, I am reported to have quoted a passage from Mr. Macaulay's Hifstoryi of Eng1yksd which was used by Lord Lyndhurst for another purpose. What I said was to this effect :-That I thought Lord Campbell's admission was of great imiportance, and that I should like it to be confirmed bv the judges, because I found in the Third Report of the Lords' Committee onthe Dignity of the Peerage, in 1S22, knowin to have been drawn up by Lord Rledesdale, the following passage:- " That, wlhatever may have been formerlv the constitution of tUe legislative assemblies of the realm, the dignity of Peer of the realm, from the time when the present constitution of those assemblies was clearly established until the union of England and Scotland, gave to the possessor of that dignity, as one of its inherent rights, the character of a niesber of such assemblies."

RAiLwAy CoanTIoTI.-Saturday completed the second week of the competition at low fares between the Great Northern and the MIidland, the London and NorthWVestern, and the Manachester, Sheffleld, and Lincolnshire Railay companies. A day or twvo previously the three junited companies made a fmrther reduction in their fares, which, notwithstanding the announcement of LSord Chandos, the chairman of the London and wNorth-WFestern Company, at their half-yearly meeting on Friday, to the effect that the dispute was settled, was followed by a similar reduction on the part of the Great Northern Company, the bills of~ annoncemenlt being dated the 23d inst. The fares on the Great Northern hine now stand as folIowr :-York Hull, Milford Junction, Bradford, Loees, Wakefield, Knottingley to London, first-class, 5s, secondclass, 3s. Gd; Doncaster, 4s. and 2s. 6d.; Sheffield, Gs. and 4s.; Retford, 4s. and 2s Gd.; Nlewnrkl, Nottingham, and Grantham, Gs. and 3s.; Lincoln, Eirkstead, Boston, and Spalding, 4s. and 2s. ; Peterborough, 2s. and Is, It is said that the Great Northern wi in all probability continue their cheap trains until the end of the present month, but that, at any rate, due notice will be given of their cessation. The *omcetition appears to havo been rather the reverse of "rmous " to the Great Nlorthern Companv, if we may judge from one example. Dunrmg the frstweekof the cheap trains 556 persons were booked from Doncaster to London, 138 by first-class, and 418 by second-class the total reocipts being 104?. 2s. ; during the weekl; ending §aturday last there were 775 passengers booked from Doncaster to londonviz., 204 by first-class, and 571- by second-class, and the total receipts were 146. 17s., which, added to the receipts of the fi-st weelk, makes 2501. 19s. The average number of passengers booked from the same station to London for several week;s previous to the competition was 40, producing about 60?., so that at this station 30one there is an excess of receipts on the two weeks of the competition, as compared with two ordinary wee s, amofntindsto rFor. st If this sum, or anything near it, may be multiplied by the number of stations at which theGreatNorthern cheaptrains have taken up p.assengers, the shareholders in that company 'will have no reason to complain at the pecuniary results oi the contest which is now, it may be supposed, En-o tually ended.

- FOBBEIG INTELLIGENCE. TRANCE. (FROM 0o OWN coRioSD.v TA portio of the following appeaIrd our seco4ndedito *fSaturdar :--- PARIS, SATM&DAY, FxBn 23, 6 P.r. Ash Pasha, the rkish.Pienipoteitjary, and suite arived in Phins last night. The Mon ur announces of ficially that the peace sconferences will open on Monday at the hotel of the STinisterof Foreign Affairs. The Moniteur publishes a decree orderinga census of the population of France to be taken, under the Superintendence of the m-ayors, during the course of the present year. The Minister of the United States in Paris and !Ihe American residents gave a grand ball last night in commemoration of the anniverary of Washing$ton's birthday-the 22a of February. It took place Sn the magnificent apartments of the new Hotel du Louvre. The saloons were thrown open at 10 o'clock; before 11 not less than 500 or 600 persons 1iad arrived, and up to an advanced hour company continued to flow in. The ballroom, which is one of the finest in Paris, was most brilliantly lighted up. At the furtherend, and imnmediatelyover the gallery where the orchestra was stationed, hung the portrait of WVashington, surmounted by the American eagIe, and by clusters of flags, with the well-known "1stars and stripes:' On the right was the portrait of Franklin, and on the left that of Lafayette, all in richly gilt frames, and adorned ,ivth similar national emblems. At the other extremity, immediately over the entrance, was the 3ortrait of President Pierce. To the right was the full-length likeness of the Empress of the French, and on the left that of the Emperor, habited in military costume, and wearing the Imperial mantle. In thq anteroora the M1inister of the United States, and the gentlemen who acted as commissaires-a rosette of blue riband on the breast being the dist;htctive maik of their offlce-received the company. The refreshment-rooms were amply supplied, and the attendance all that could be desired. Among the gruests were members of the Cabinet and of the diplomatic corps. General Canrobert, who arrived about 11 o'clock, attracted much attention. He appeared in plain evening dress and wore the Star of the Leagion of Honour. One of the earliest 'to arrive was Senor CaIderon de la Barca, who was so Iong Spanish BMinister at Washington. On the whole, the fete was one of the most brilliant of the season. The Mroniieturde la M7otte, under the head of " La Verite sur Nicholaief," contains an article, from which we extractthe folowing portion *- " Nicholaieff is not merely a port of construction, as is generally believed in Europe, but a port for arming vessels of war. In difficult circumstances the Russian squadron of reserve used to be stationed there, and if that has not taken place during the present war the reason is that Prince Menschikoff desired to have, from the begnning of the war, tnuder his orders in the port of Sebastopol all the armed vessels which were in the Black Sea. In order, too, that vessels of war should be able to navigatoehetween Nicholaieff and the sea the Russian Board of Admiralty has had a channel made the whole way dow, from which every rock or impediment has been carefully removed, and in which, during eight months of the year, there are 23 feet of water. !rhat depth becomes considerably greater when the river rises. The Russian fleet in the Black Sea at the com:nencement of the war consisted of 16 ships-of-the-line, among which only threewere of the first class; the others, all of tiethirdandfourth class, dre-only22 feetof water when sully armed. The arming of thesevesselshad been effected altogether at NicholWieff, and they a-mvired at Sebas. topol without the slightest difficulty by following the channel already mentioned, each having her guns on lboard, as well as her full complement of men, and an entire supply of provisions and stores. It results from 'what h-as just been said, that ships of the line can be built and armed at Nicholnieff, and can then, during the greater 3part of the year, proceed to sea quite ready to fight. As to 'vessels of 120 guns and upwards, they can take all their gns oa boardwith the exception of those of the lower deck, and complete their armament at SebastopoL It mnay thus be seen what advantages can be derived from aTicholaic. Both that place and Sebastopol are classed in Russia among the ports of the Black Sea, just as Pchrfort and L'Orient, which are some way inland, are in the list of the ports of France."

(Eoat oun oWN CoRNmSPOaDMST.) BERLIN, FEB. 21. In May, 185D, this Government obtained from the Chambers a loan of 30,000,000 thalers, to enable it to pu the army into a state of readiness for 'war. As only a small portion of this amount was excpreded in the remaining months of thatirast year, theaC(amber required an account tohbe given in of the outgoing, and reserved to itself the right of empowering the Government year by year to continue to apply any remaining balance to the same object, or to divert it to another in case the emergency should be no longer the same. Tln the first year the amount expended 'was only 4,350,723 thalers; for the second, however (1855), it rose to 10,420,457 thalers, leqving a balance in the hands of the Government (for the loan had in the meantime been issued and the money paid in) of mora than 15,000,000 for the expenses, of the current year. In aplying to the House of Deputies in this session for leave to continue to apply this bal3nce to the purzposes of keepmng the arm uprepared for war, the Government submitted a memorial to the members, showing how the money had hitherto been spent, and statng its reasons for continuing the expenditure in this year The memorial itself only detailed these reasons in a very general and cursory manner, but at a meeting of the committee to which the subject was referred for preliminary investigation the President of the 3lini.sty, Baron von Manteuffel, went somewhat more into particulars. He showed that in the presence of so many contending impulses, it had been anythingt but an easy task to maintain unmoved the position that Prussia had taken up, and, undoubtedly to the advantage of the country, preserved. The credit that had been voted and the readine3s of the army for war had doubtless contributed very much towards enabling the Government to do this. Just of late, it was true, the prospect of a pacific settlement of the conflict had attained a great degree of probability; but, nevertheles;, things had notyetbeen sufficientlyfararranged for them to look upon the European crisis as at an end; it was, however, not possible for him at the present moment to enter into further details in this respect. But as the belligerent Powers had found in the opening of anegotiations no occasion for discontinuing their preparations, and tne Queen of England had, in her last speech from the throne, specifically stated that these preparations would be continued to their fullest extent, people's eyes were naburally turned towards the Baltic. The possible development of war on the rontier3 of this country was the most urgent call on :P±-qaia to retain her state of readiness for war, and, in case of need, to increaae it. The committee coincided in these views, and agreed that, under the present circumsrtances, it was incumbenlt on the country,not only to be prepared to resist any attack, but also to take that part in thue Iconflict of the E uropean Powers which accords with it interests and its duties as a federal State. It saidthat the country was bound to express its gratitude to the Government for having succeeded lin a period of such difficulty in preserving to Prussia not only peace, but also her freedom of action, and came to thei unanimous resolution of recommending to the Hotu- to pass the bil for empowering the Ministry to continue to make use of the balance of the loan for the purpose of keeping the army in a state of readiness for war. The memorial, although it says but. little about the motives for the oontinuation of the KriegslxreitscAaft, gives a number of details as to what this readiness for war has consisted in, ana though they have nearly aU of them been already reported to you at various times, it may not be without advantage here to recapitulate them. All the regiments of cavalry and all the batteries of horse artillery were kept at the full war complement; all the recruits that should have joined at April of this yearwere summoned totheir regiments i m October of last year; and, furthermore, the deficiency of complement that usually takes place in winter has not bden allowed- to occur. This increase of force caused an increased outlay of 4,600,000 thalers ior keep, fc; and, together with extraordinary outgoings, 4,630,000. Further, every regiment of artillery has had a 5th foot battery of 6-pounders added to it. FBor the purpose ofproviding the whole armywith firearmnswith riffed barrels, all the percussion muskets have been altered into Mini4s. The manufactories for the production of the needle-guns have been extremely enlarged, so as to turn out increased numbers in shorter time. In connexion with these preparations, large quantities of ammunition for the 3Mini6rifles and -the needle-guns have been manufactured, and new practising grounds laid out, suitable to the longer range now attainable. Additional artillery has been procured, of greater calibre and longer range; this has entailed the necessity of increased outlay for ammunition, and for the exercis2 of the men on an unusually large scale with the new guns and rockets. The stock of cutting weapons has been much increased. One year's supply of bullet proof cast steel cuirasses is already in store. Above 50W,000 thalers have been expended, in addition to the usual outhay, upon the fortresses, more particularly Konigsberg and Boyen (L5tzen). An electro-magnetic telegraph for use in the field and active service has been constructed and completed. A special corps of "bearers" for the sick and wounded has been organized, clothed, andexercised. Afull complement of surgicalinstrumentsandeverything necessary to surgical practice has been laid in. These, together with various other outlays, for improved clothing and arming, have amounted to 2,790,45' thalers The fortress of Spandau has of late gained increased importance from the circumstance of the gun foundries of Berlin and also the manufactories of smnall arms and percussion caps having been concentrated there; 150,000 thalers are therefore to be spent on it annually until its fortifications have attained the degree of security which the importance of the place calls for. A similar want of additional security has been felt of late with regard to 3Iagdeburg; it is, therefore, intended to construct there a new bombproof arsenal and ordnance dep0t, to which the important stores of arms and ammunition kept there can be with more propriety intru;sted than to the present old-fashioned citadel and keep.

IBELA7D. FORGED CONVEYANCE OF Tr'TLE. (Fno: our. OWN CoRnrFogJnrvNT D7UBL]N. SAT'rnDAV 7fnP'r There is, unfortunately, too much truth in the followng extraordiary statement, which appears in the Du, iu Mercantile Adtertiser of yesterday even- " We have learnt that during the present week a deed of conveyance of a portion of the Coo"nu'nckestate, county of Waterford, was sent over from London to a solicitor in this city to be registered. It purported to convey certain townIands or a consideration of 35,000h. It bore the signatures of two of the Commissioners, Dr. Longfield and Mr. Hargreave; and of two attesting witnesses, Mr. Keith Hal. lowes, of the eminent frm of Messrs. alla,owes and Hamilton, solicitors, and Mr. Arthur Bushe. It turned out that all the signatures were forgere, and that no such conveyance had ever been made. The document was not drawn with formal correctness, as the signature of the secretay, Mr. Henry Carey, was not attached and in other respects it was not in accordance with the proper form of conveyance used in the Encumabered Estates Cort. It appears that one of the earliest sales in that court was of a portion of the Coolnaamuck estate, for a sum of 8,0001. and that in that case a regular deed of conveyance was made at the time. It is stated that a gentleman of large capital named Padwick, residing in London, had advanced 10,000. upon the forged conveyance, which was assigned to him, duly stamned, and that the discovery took place on his for. warding it to Dublin for registration." The derangement of the affairs of the Tipperary Bank continues to be severely felt in the several branches throughout the southern and midland counties, and no one can predicate what the end may be, or even faintly guess the actual amount of the liabilities for which the proprietary may be made responsible. The petition presented to the Court of Chancery for winding up the concern cannot be he4rd before the 4th of next month, and until then nothing reliable can be ascertained with respect to the affairs of the bank. Messrs. Morrough and Kennedy are the solicitors for the petitioner, one Danid Rafferty, described as a farmer, residing at a place called Ulla, in the counnty of Tipperary, and it is believed that the proceedings have not been instutted with any hostile intention.

iYA YAL AND MiLITARY InTELLIGENCE. Her M4ajestys steam transport Himalaya, Commander B. Priest, I.N., arrived at Spithead on Saturday from the East. She left Malta on the 12th, passed Gibraltar, witholot communicating, before daylight on the Sunday after leaving Malta, and arrived at Spithead at 8 a.m. on Saturday; almost constant head winds and heavy head sea retarded her voyage. The bottom of the ship has got very foul, so that her speedisdecrea3sdnearly3 knots perhour; soapparent is her diminished rate of steaming, that even the Jura best her nearly tbree knots in a run of 300. She wants but a trifling refit, and as soon as she is docked and cleaned she wi again be as efficient as formerly. Since March last xhe has run 35,000 miles, aud has carried 4,000 horses and 5,000 men, besides vast cargoes of stores. The engines hava performed nearly 9,000,000 revolutions during this period. She left Portsmouth yesterday morning for Southampton. The Sprightly steam, tender,I Mr. George Allen, master commanding, went out to Spithead on Saturday, and brought inx all the superumeraries from the Himalaya. Her Majesty's ship Imperieuse, 51, Captain IL B. Watson, C.B.; Pylades, 21, Captain JYEyncourt; and the Falcon, 17, Commander Pullen, all screw vessels, forming a portion of the advanced squadron of the Baltic fleet, left Spithead for the Downs (where they will await futther orders) on Saturday, and the Harier, 17, Commander Deriman (which arrived at Spithead from Dartmouth on Saturday), was ordered to follov them yesterday. They will be joined by the Euryalus, 51, Captain Ramsay, C.B., and the Arrogant, 47, Captain Lyster. The Blenheim, 60, screw block ship, Captain W. E. Hall (Nemesis), C.B., left Spithead at daylighnt yesterday morning for Lisbon. - - The Dragon, 6, paddle frigate, Captain H. Stewart, left Spithead on Saturday to follow the advanced squadron. The steam transport Telegraph left Spithead on Saturday for the Thames. The Hawke, 60, Captain Ommauney, has left her berth at the Motherbankand returned to Spithead, leaving there, in charge of the gunboat flotilla, the Colossus, 81, Captain the Hon. H. Keppel, C.B. The Thames steam transport embarked on Saturday it Portsmouh. the following officers and troops for the Crimea :-Ensigns Hunter, Johnson, Thompson, and Kershaw, and 88 men of the 1st Royal Regiment of Foot; Captain Pownall, Ensigns Brace, Huyshe, Torriano, and Hotehkin, and 136 men of the 3d (Buffs) ; Captains Tryon and M`Henry. Lieutenant Disney, and Ensign Franklin, and 37 men of the 7th Fusileers; Lieutenant Hackett, Ensigns Fitzroy, Walwyn, and Richards, and 70 men of the 23d Royal Welsh Fusileers; and Lieatenant HeJlyer, Ensigns Kentish and Carlow, and 120 men of the 46th Regiment. She went out of Portsmouth harbour, 'and direct for Balaklava. The Algiers, 91, Captain Codrington, C.B., was taken into dock on Saturday at Portsmouth, and the Shannon, 51, taken out. The Fury, 6, paddle-sloop, was also docked on Saturday. The screw steamship Orion, 91, Captain John E. Erskine, left Plymouth Sound on Friday, for a cruise in the Channel, to try her engines. The hospital-ship Belleisle, 6, Commander James Hosken, was towed from Plymouth Sound into Hamoaze on Saturday by the Confiance and Zephyr steamvessels. Tne screw steamship Nile, Captain George Mundy, and the screw steam-frigate Euryalus, 51, Captain George Ramsay, steamed from Hamoazo into the Sound on Saturday. The London, 90, Captain Augustus L Kuper, will be placed in the basin dock at Devonport to-day. The Forrester gunboat has arrived at Woolwieh from Messrs. Pitcher's building-yard, and is commissioned by Lieutenant Innes. She is under the hands of the riggers. The gunboat Bouncer, 4 guns, 232 tons' burden, launched at Blackwall, and taken to Messrs. Penn's to receive her engines, is expected at Woolwich in a day or two. A large number of 10 and 13 inch mortars have been proved at the butt at Woolwich during the last few days, which have passed through the trials satisfactorily, with but two exceptions. A day or two since a 10-inch mortar, loadedwith the usual proof charge of 931b. of powcder, &c., completely reversed its position, and pointed the muzzle towards the arsenal, when it burst into 13 large pieces. The shot had fortunately escaped before the movement took place, and no accident resulted. A 10-inch sea service mortar also burst under proof on Friday. The proofs are to be conducted in future in an experimental manner by firing the various pieces singly, in order to avoid any accident which might be producedby thefragments striking the other pieces whose fuses were formerly lighted to be fired at the same time. An Admiralty order has arrived at Sheerness promoting Commander John B. Marsh (who has held the rank of Commander since the 20th of 3May, 1844, and Commander's command of the flagshipWaterloo), to be Captain. Itis reported that Captain Mlarsh is to be appointed immediately to one of the new screw steam frigates fitting to join the spring fleet. Her Majesty's order for the admission of strangers to view the trophies was on Friday issued to the police at the Royal Arsenal-gate at Woolwich, and so great is the public curiosity with regard to the various articles captured at the seat of war that numbers of persons are constantly arriving. Her Majesty was so impressed with the sight of her brave soldiers thus surrounded by the Russian trophies that she resolved to retain some mementoes of her visit to Woolwich ArsenaL An order was conveyed the same eveningfromWindsor Castle tothe household photographer, lEr. J. E. Mayall, to proceed to Woolwich and produce several groups of faces and whatever he should consider most interesting. Accordhigly, the artist, with his assistants, was employed throughout Friday and Saturday in striking off the most prominent features of the trophy ground for Her Majesty. An ambulance wangon was brought to the spot for Mr. 31ayall's laboratory, and measures were taken by the police to prevent any obstruction by the crowd. Six Russian prisoners of war, soldiers and sailors have, at their own earnest request, been sent on board the Waterloo from the Devonshire, having volunteered for the service. There are now only 25 prisoners of war, including merchant seamen, on board the Russian prison-ship Devonshire, Lieu. tenant-Commander John H. Lloyd. The officer commanding the depot of the 22d Regiment, at Chatham, has been directed to select a certain number of the non-commissioned officers of that corps to be transferred to the 2d West India Regiment, where they will be appointedtothe rank of company sergeant-majors.

The President tool the chair at 11 o'eclock. LKCrION OF SOLICITOR AIMD ASSISTANT-OFImCRS. Mr. Woolrych, the secretary, read the report of the com. mitteeof the whole board appointed for the nomination of assistant-clerks and officers, and of a solicitor to the board, and to elect such officers The report recomnmended the appointment of two principal assistant-clerks by name, to assist in the clerk's department, and six assistant-clerls; three elerks to assist in the accountant's de)artment, three assistant-engineers, Bix clerlks of works, smx dranghtsmen four engineers' clerks, and two in the superintending architect's department. They also recommended that esr Smith and Son be solicitors to the board. The -whole of the appointmentswere recommended ho be mado during tho p leasure of the board. Mr. Wrai;esoy moved, and Mr. BRISTOWV seconded, tho reception and confirmation of the report. 3Fr. Deuaty HAR1U SON moved, as an amendment, the ubOstitution of the nameo of Mfr. Donldson for that of Mr, Grant, as one of the assistant-engineers, on the ground that the latter gentleman might not cordially co-operate with the engineer-in-chief Several of the members suggested, as a mode of getting over the diffaiculty, that it be left to Mr. Bazalgette, the engineer-in-chief, to say which of the two gentlemen in question was likely to afford him the most efficient assistance, and then to appoint the one which he recommended. The PRxsmgrNT' said he apprehended it was the duty of this board in electing its] officers to take care that, when a chief officer's opinion was sought to be taken as to those most likely to serve him efficiently, that chief officer did not recommend a yerson merely because on the onehand he might have a partiality for him, and therefore bo desirous of securing an appointment infavour of a person who might not be so competent as another; nor, on the other hand, to reject an old and tried officer. (Hear, hear.) He therefore he d, as a publie principle, that the board was bound to see that no one was appointed or rejected merely becanse there was a bias of feeling among the heads of departments. (Hear, hear.) With respect to the gentlemen in question, he felt bound. as an honest man, as ehairman of that body, and as having specal knowledge of the qualEfications of Mr1. Grant, to say tat he was in every respect an able man, and was, besides, exceedingly anxious, if elected, to afford efficient assistance to the engineer in chief; and he could not help thinking the present opposition had its origin in some personal feeling. MTr. Deputy HARIaaSON i'ndignantly denied that he was actuated by any other feeling than a regard for the public good in moving the amendment under consideration, and he would not sit still and bear his motivres misrepresented, even by the chairman. The PRESTMENT disclaimed the slightest wish to mis. represent the hon. deputy. The discussion, which eventually assumed a tone of some warmth, was continued by Mr. . L. TAYLoR, Mr. aln,d hr. SAVAGE, Mz. BIDG00D, Mr. DAVIS, MEr. Hows, Mr R1. TAYLOR, 33r. 1NIcuOLAY, MEr. D'IFANGER, Mr. HUNT, rid several other members, and ultimately the appointment of Mr. Grant was confirmed by 21 votes against 15 and the report was received and adopted in its integrity. I5MSEA*HATLH.S Mr. D'ITu.&?R begged to ask the hon. member for raipotead (Mr. Turner) if he and his constituents had taken any, and what, meaes to oppos a bill introduced in the Houen oaf Lords which, if cathed, would enabMe Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson to build over Hlampstead-heathi which o mght he saidtobe one of the lungs of London e He also reminded the hon. member and the board that the title of the bill in qhestion, which was caDned the "Leases and Sales of Settled Estates Bill," was such that the general public woald never imagine atfirst sight that the apnropria. tion of Hampstead-heath for building purposes colfd ever take place under it. MEr. TuiR said the hon. member and the hoard would recollect that, when this bill was bronght forward in the last session of Parliament, a. clause was introduced by the Solicitor-Generaltothe effect that the exemptions proviously made by Parliament shonld he xemptions under thise bilL The lord Chancelor in introducingt the sresent bill bad done so omitting those clauses, hut the inhabitants of Han pstea d had represented to certainmembersof the House of Lords their opinion of the justice of reinsertig in thebill clauses similar in spirit, if notinterms,tothose proposed by the Solicitor-GeneraL. The questionwasnot yet determined by the House, but hon. members might rest assured the inhabitants would not lose sight of the subject and would do their best to have such clauses inserted.

Mr. Woolrych read the report on the state of the colections of the distictsewers-rates for January last, from which it appeared that the total amount of those rates over the whole of the districts was 241,67wc 3s. 2Ld, of which 190,96a s 14s. d. had been collected and paid touthe trheIsurer, and 60,7151. 9s. ld. remained uncollected.

They lsad of the a at present was the finance committee, and heathoght they might fairly appoint another permanent committee n refe once to public works without laying themselves open to the charge which was occasionally made at the hoard, that they wer reelinquih ng any of the functMons which belengtd to them in their collecetve capacity. If 1hi moton should be successful he aould divide the metropolis for the purpose of such a committee into about l6 districts, and have each of them properly represented intthe committee. Mcr.

Bieamfr, thea ommo Mr. BnIDG0D said he could not agree with MEr.

By the act of Parliament under which they were emboied all committees appointed by the board sat oly by sufferance. He thought great public good Would result from such a committee, and he cordially supported its appointment. MEr. Buaisnn also supported tha motion, and denied that in the appointment of any previons committee the hoard had ever delegated any of its pow era to them. Mr. Hal s objected altogether to the system of appoint ingcommittees on almost every conceivasle occasion, and contended that in delegateig their functions to such crommittees the members of the hoard were neglectng the duies they owed to those whom they represented.

I THE LOA JA. (Fromnthe Econom? t. IAnY one -who had attentively studiid the finiuancokeoun~s AS they appered in the anua balafce4heetwhen prented to Parliamient and mnade up to- the close of the year auFht tG havebeeni prepiared. fora&very smrall loan, if anL, ore. the clo6e of thefioandal year on the 31st' of Marchl In an analysis of that account in a recent,number we showed that the re'venue had yielded- for the three quarters &lready e-xpired nearly the full proportion calculated upon at the time of the budget, and that the expenditure was not very periously in excess. From the two -fiources-thatis, from .defici is vncome andcexcess oe expnditure-it appearedthat, Leven making f& very liberal 2oewmro for the unexpired tquarter of the year, the entire deficiency could not be estirated to'exceed frnom 3i500,ODO0. to 4,000,00!. ; and the fair iniference therefore was, that if an operation of borrowin in any form took place, nufder present circumsLanom ~ it would not be to-an extent much greater than to cover such estimated deficiency. It is true that there are thoe who think that another lonl nus shortly be made whether we have peace or war, and who blame the Chanceuor of the Exchequer for not at once maldag the present one larea enough to include all his posible requirements for tuh present year. But such posons assume two things, one of which is very uncertain, and the other that the Minise shoula miake a bargain which would obviously be to the disadvantage of the public and to the gain of the contraotor. If we are to go on with the war, no doubt we shall Tequire another loan to aidc the expendliture of 1856-57 to rome extent ;-for though it is probable. that in that ewe Parliament would sanctiotnsome further increase of taxotion, yet it is also probable that a portion of the expenditur would b e met by a - loamn. But surely no 1intrwould- be justified in making a large loan for awaUr expendiatufre for next -year, when it is 2o Exghe prbbe6on spthats we sallhave concluded a peace;oand whien on that event, id hfe; shold even requtre -alVan,hew begablet tocfis obtiftuo thee-thcs much moret il But is it quite tain that in the event of peace being concludedaPasafute loan will be required) Tbis 'we think is fairly a debateable point. No doubt, even thoreh peace should be concluded in April, avery large expenditure must be incurred during the folloeing six months tn bringing home the army, and before the establishxments can be reduced to their permanent position. On the other. hand, the expenses of such operations will bear but a small proportion to those ofactivwarfare. Atpwhatever sumiwe assume the extra expenditure of the pat year on account of the war, it is important to bear in mind that it has been providd forin art by additional taxes to the amount of other d000es The point -which we think -has not been sufcciently adverted to.is the large tnortion of the war expenditure that has thus been paid bjy taxation, and the fact thate byfor the y act l of Pa reducedwilamentogr n taxes they must cOntinu whinh full force somer time after^t^ conclusionofpeace . Theex n y consest NofI dthe malt duty; 2, xcie dtie onspiitsin relndand Scotland; 3, Cusom utis o te, sgar an cofee 4, the property 'With regard to the first of these-the malt duty-it will expire, aecordingto the act, on the 5th of July next succeeding the ratification of a definite treaty of peace. If, therefore, peice shall be conclucded in Aprl, it will expire in July,next ; but, inaumuch as considerable credits are given upon this duty, the payments into the Exchequer wim continue much longer. With regardl to the second-the spirit duties-theme are permanent, no provision existing for their reduction; and with regarl to the third andefourth classes-viz., the Customs' duties and the income-tax-they expire only on the sfifth day of April which shall first happen after the expiration of one year from the ratification of a definitive treaty of peace" Therefore, supposing such ratification to take plaoe in the course of this summer and after the 5th of April, and it cannot be before, then these large branches of additional revenue wil remainin fu0l force until the 5th of April, 1858-that is, for two ffrU years. The additional malt duty tmay be taken at 2,500,000i, and the ether duties at 12,500,0001. Taking it for granted that 1,000,0001 of the additional malt duty wll remain to be collected after the 31st of March, then the produce of the war taxes before they will be reduced wil amiount to 26,000,000!., whichl wil be avaable after the conclusion of peace for extraordinary purposes. No doubt this large sum lcome into-the or-chequer only as the taxes are colleated duccording t the nextatwoyears, o the largest part of eeeLtutthe expenditurewlapy a mtof the dfirst si u months. As soon, hSowever, aS ihat becomescertain that the aris reay concrate luded, it is but reasonfble to infer that therewill bxendituffenet facilies i^Ther m tey-mket to enat Government to anticipate terevenue some 3months before itisdue by ieans of consolidated fundbills or otherwise a and it would certainly be very undesmble to increase the amount of the funded debt only for a temporary use. It would, indeed, obviously, as a nmtter of economy, 'be much better to resort to axchequerbia or bends, or oiher short securiti, even though at a comparatively unfavourable rate, than to increase the permanent debt. The portion of the -war taxes which will become payahbe in the six months after the 31st of March may be estimated at 7,500,0001. at least, and, even though the additional expenditure should reach 10,000,000!. or 12,000,00I. during tlhat period, the difference would not be o great but that it could in all probability be easily raised i some temporai form, especially as the large revenue of the folowing six months and the year 185o-5n would be more tlha sufficient to liquidate such temporary obligations. We have this broad fact to deal with-viz that if peace be now made, we are secured of additioa revenue in the next two years. to the amount of at least 26,000,000!., available tomaeettheemergenciesof themoment in cindingted the war. And, it ought not to be difrault with the credit of the Governlent to render such ga income available by anticipation, without contracting any further permanent debt, or, at all events, to a very small amount. According to the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer last night, the exact amount of the deficiency upon ths year is 3,560,000!., so that - the loan of 5,000,000! jUSt Contracted whil leave a susrplus of 1,50,0001. towards the expenditure of next year. There is little doubt that the chief pressureo for money during the next year, shoulde peae i he concludced,will hevec inue,d to the first quater ofe byea aede-that watrever caithe Government may require wil bhe chidefl zthens felt.chwe operation, thidafowof hos seuriiesin he and ofthepublic considerably below the ordinary sum. It is taue there are now Illoating 23,00,000!. of Exchequer-bills, but, as it cwas state lamst night, 5,000,000!. are in the hands of the Commissioners for the Reductionof the NationalDebt, leavin- only 18,000,000!. with the public, including the amount heldy the Bankl;-so that when 3,000.000f. have been funded, the wholeamount in circulation willbe only 15,000,000. With this diminished amodnt, it is not improbable that theyd will, as peace becomes more certain, rise to a considerable premium at the present high rate of interest. Referring to the terms at which this twofold operation has been concluded, the pubnic have certainly a right to be satisfied with them. Wit hConsolsat9 , the double opera-tion has been accomplishedl at 90, lea ving a maigin of It. 5s. per cent-the sam et we seieve, upon which a loan was ever contracted. The only inference which is to be drawn from such terms is, that all parties entertain great confiLdence in-the success of the negotiations at SPars. The btatement of the Chancelior of the Exchequer on F'riday night in many ways went to p rove the truth of that passage in the Queen's Speech at the opening of Parliamaent which stated that "1the resources of. the emp ire ere unimpaired."

It is gene. raly supsposed that the Government will take advantage of this resignation to carry into execution the reforms suggested by the Royal Commissioners of 1850. The Commissioners say :-" With respectto the executive management, your commissioners are unanimonsly of opinion that a change sbould be adopted involving the abolition of the ofices of pncipal librarian and of secretary as they now exist, and the establishment of a responsible executive ouncil. The view wrhich has met the approval of the majority of your commissioners is that an executive council should be formed, consisting of a chairman to be appointed by the Crown, and wo, if not already a trutstee, should beome atrustee by virtue of his office, asnd four members to be c hosen bythe trustees fromamong theirowlnnumber, andtwo o)thermemberstobe appointedbythceCrown,enedistingmished for attainment in literature, and the other for attainment in na l history,-the former0of whom should be considered as having a more immediate and especial supervision of those departments of the Museum connected with literature%-namely, the library, the manuscripts, the prints, antiquities, and medals; and the latter, of those depaitments which are devoted almost exclusively to natural history. The chairman, in our opinion, should hold not for life, or merely during pleasure, but for a definite term, such as five years, being reeligible-if his re-appointment should be thought expedient. We think he ought to be a person of such position in socictyand influence as may be naturally looked for in any one .holdino' so important an office, &c. The executive council, as wo'lsvre newv proposed it, carries vrith it in the opinion of all of us this great and leadmng advantage, without attaining which all other reforms in the constitution of the Museum are in the view of your commissioners comparatively of little consequence-th t it commits the ordinary and daily recurriag business of the Museum to an execative council consisting of a number such as must leave upon each andc all of them individual responsibility, insure k-owledge and 'careful consideration of the businesi of the Museum in its whole course, and prevent that change in tho view and uncertainty of decision which cannot but be the consequenco of a fluctuating board."

The petition stated that on the 28th of January, 1856, the petitioners presented their petition to the district court, alleging that W.il 11am Palmer, being a trader, and haVing- resided for six calendar months vwithin that district-that is to say at iugeley and Stafford,-was indebted to them in 1001., and had, s they had been informed and believed, committed an act of bankruptcy, and praying for an adjudication; that the same petition was filed oh the same day; that upon the hearing of the petition the debt and trading were proved, and the act of bankruptcy was proved by the deposition of lMr. William Fulford, the governor of Stafford gaol, who swore that ho received WilliamPalmer into his custody under a warrant issued upon a capias at the suit of Henry Padwick, and also under the coroner's warrant on a charge of murder, on the 17th of December, 185, and that he had remained in custody at Stafford gaol ever since, and now is in the crininal sideof the sme, the capias on the debt being stinl nndircharge;a that tho act of bank. ruptcy was also proved by the deposislon of Henry Gilhard, the assistant of a sheriff's officer, vho deposed that he arrested William Palmer at his own house on the 13th of December, 1855, and remained with him there until the 17th, when he was removed to Stafford Gaol on the coronets warrant, which issued after the capias ; that Mr. Commissioner Balguy decided that the fact proved did not constitute an act of bankruptcy committed by William Palmer, and made the following minute:-" Ithink there is not a good act of bankruptcy, being of opinion that the lying in prison was under criminal as well as civil process - hut 1find there is suffident evidence of an act of trading." The Commissioner therefore refused the adjudication, and the petitioner now prayed that such adjudication might issue. The 69th section of the Banraupt law Consolidation Act enacts, " that if any such trader having been arrested or committed to prison for debt, or on any attachment for nonpayment of money, shall, upon such or any otheranrest or commitment for debt or non-payment of money, or upon any detention for debt, lie in prison 21 days, or haring been arrestcd or committed to prison for any other cause shalt lie in prison 21 days V.pon any dctainer for debt lodged against him and not disclzarnjd, every such trader shall thereby be deenmed to have committed an act of baik. ruptcy." Mr. DAnaL and Mr. AxcIsAriD SarTir openedthe appeal, but lord Juice KSIGHsT BnucE intimated a doubt, as there was no adjudication, whether this Court could hear the matter, tho effect of which might be that the Lords Justices would be performing the office of adjudication, which it did not appear to his Lordship wasw ithin the power of the court. Mr. DAn L observed that the 14th section of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act gave the Parties powver of appeal against all orders and decisions of the Commissioners. lr. DE GEX, in answer to a question from the Court, said that he was not instructed to consent that the appeal should be heard on the assumption that the Commissoner had adjudicated.

After the Vice-Chancellor had disposed of his list of petitions his Hlonour proceeded to hear causes, but no case requiring a report came before the Court. (Before Vicc-C7tancelWor Sir W. P. WooD.} : THER V. FRASM The arguments in this case, which we have alrady noticed, were this morning resumed. The plaintiffs, Messrs. John and William Wather, of Liverpool, had, in August, 1854, agreed to lend 7,000W to Messrs. Barton, who were copper roller manufacturers, and who cTrriedon business at Broughton-bridge at Salford, in Lancashire, their manufactory, of which they were owners in fee, being called the Broughton Copper lWorl. By indenture dated the 24th of August, 1854, which recited that the Bartons were carrying on business at their mills or factories as copper roller manufacturers, and in such capacity had lately affixed to the plots of land, mnils, or factories, and herecditaments a steam-engine and boilers, together with a 1re quantity of miligear and millwright worl, in consideration of 7,0001. hesws. Barton conveyed to therplaintis, their heirs nd as5igns, byaway of mortgage, the said plots of land, mills or factories, dwelling honses, andahereditamnents in the occupatien of the mnertagors, and also al and singular steam-engie, steam nolers, miligear, millwright worlr, and eachinery, then or thereafter to be fixed to the said ands, hereditaments, and premises or any of thes, or ny part thereof, together aith all houses, fxtures, rigets, anauhers, aed appurtenances to the said plots of and,mi or factories, or any of them, or any part thereof, belonging or appertaening, subject to w proviso for redemption. A covenant was also contained in tho deed that the mortgagors would not pull down or remove the mills or factories, dwelling-houses, erections, or buildings, steam-engines, boilers, adingear, milwright work, or premises vnithout the pmchission in writing of tle plaintiffs. Before the moneyhad been advancei the plaintiffs caused a valuation to bsmad of the premises, including the machinery so afl taed, and it was alleged that the advance had been made entirely upon the faith of the machinery havint been included in the security, which would otherwise have been wholly insufficient. On the 23d of May, 1SSS, Messrs Barton were, upon their petition, duly adjudicated bankrupts. The defendants, the assignees in bankruptcy, bad i' October, 1855, advertised for saile all the machinery belonging to the firm of Barton and Co., a great portion of wbich consisted of brick erections secured to stone foundations, or was deeply sunk; in the ground and secured to the freehold, and in some eases secured with bolhs and lead, and attached by pipes. The plaintifs, after some correspondence, had filedtheir bIlli to restrain the defendants from selling such of these particulars is wvere eomprised in their mortgage, and any thin"s comprised in the follown description:-" The steam-en ie, steam beoiler, miligear, m.illwright worl;s, and machinery," which were ou the 23d of August. 1854., or since, fix;ed to the lands, mills, and premises comprised in the mortgage deed. lYfr.

Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn appeared for the Plaintift and Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Katyo for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action was an Irish merchant, who sued the defendants, Messrs. A. Rblli and Co., Greek merchbani, of London, to recover daniages for the breach of a contract into which they had entered 'with the plaintiff to eell him a cargo of wheat as per bill of lading, &c. The te:ins of the contract were contained in the sold note, vhich had this condition, that " should any difference arise as to this con!tract, the szame is to be left to arbitration in L;ondon in the usual mnmner." The breach relied rpon was that a difference as to the contract had arisen, but the defendant refused to refer the difference. The declaration contained a second count for money had and received. The defendant, as to the first count, paid into court the sum of 20s., and alleged that the plaintiff sustained no further damiage; and, as to the second connt, he pleaded that lie never ws indebted. It appeared that the goods in question were deficient in quantity, the deficiency amountinrg to as much as 34 quarters, valued at 100l., and this value the plaintiff now sought to recover as damages for the defendant's breach of contrac in refusing to refer the difference to arbit ation, as ho was bound to do by the terms of his contract. No question was now made as to whether an action could be sustained upon sucb a refusal, the Court baving decided :pon demurrer in favour of the plaintiff, though it was hrown otf that the defendant did rnot consider himnself bound by that decision, but intended to take the case to a Court of Error. The only question now was whether the Plaintiff was entitled to any more damages than the suumof s. p.ad into court, and, if -o, to what amount. Evidence was given to show that arbitrators on the Corn Kxchange, to whom such questions as the present were submitted, acted rpon a certain customary rule, according to which the plaintiff contended he would have been allowed the full value of the deficiency. On the other hand, the defendant denied the existence of such a customary rele, and he fnrther attempted to show that the plaintiff's loss was only imagninary, inasmuch as the full quantity specified in the bill of lading had been put on hoard the vessel at Tagaurog, and that if there Was any deficiency it arose from some cause which the defendanW itnesses failed to explain. Lord CArPBELrL said the first question he should leave to thejury would he whether the full cargo specified in the Lill of lading had been loaded at Taganrog. The jury answered this question in the negative. Lord CAsSiPBZLL then summed up the evidence, and said that when this case was in the Court of Queen's Bench he -as of opinion that it should he left to mercantile men, if thecy thought fit, to introduxce such a clause as the present mnto their contra.cts, v<, that if any difference should arise respecting the contract, it should he referred to arbitration. A clause of that kind oght to he respected.; here the defendant had refused to refer the differencetoarbitration,andthe question now was what damages the plaintiffwas entitled to recover for the breach of promise. h was stated in evidence that if the difference had been referred under that clause the plaintiff would have recovered by the award of the arbitrator the amount of the deficiency, a"cordinJr to the custom which prevailed in the corn trade. His 1ordship then asked the jury whether they agreed in that opinion. Thc jury answered that they did. Alfter some farther discussion, Lord Cl Q rnEriL directed that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff on both issues, damages 991. odd, givi the defendant leave to move to enter the verdict iu his favour. MGR.Ua V. nLtIsO-. Mtr. Knsowles, Q-C., and Mr. 'Untliank appearedl for the plaintiff; and Mr. J. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn for the defendant. The plaintiffin this action, CharlesIngram,wasthe owner of the ship Forfarshire, who sued the defendant, WilliMim IHarrison, one of 6S underwriters, rpon a plicy of insurance which had been effected upon the Forfarshire, on a voyage to India and China, but which had been totally lost, by being wrecked on a reef of rocks off Bomnbay Roads. The defendant, who had underwritten the policy for 3001., adanitted his liability for 66W. S.. Od., bht denied any liability beyond that sum. The prineifnl question depended on whether cast-iron ballast, technically caUed " kentledge,n was to be considered part of the " ship," like the ropes, anchors, &c., or was included in the terms " stores, furniture, and apuarie," so as to entitle the defendant to the benefit thereof by way of salvage. It appeared that the vessel in question had been sold by imbue auction at Bombay, and the " kentledge, which consisted of about 130 tons of castiron, had been sold alongt with it, as part of the SowS~ now cited a decision by Lord EUenborough (in 2, Starkid's Reports), that in a bi of sale of a " asip, tackle, storeNs, and apparel," the "kentledge" did :ot pam. He therefore contended that the defendant mus rely upon a custom that in a policy of insurance it was included intre terms "ship, store, funiiture, and appareL"y The learned counsel cilled several witnesses to show that betweeen the srer and assured " kentledge" was no paxt ef the "ship, store-, f4rnitAre, or apparel, 2and conse- quently. nostbeing covered by the policy, the defendaut Wa not entitled to-the value tbtereof by way of salvage. J. Mr. W%th called several witnecseafor the defeuce. They were gentermen who had been for many sears engaged At Iloyd! as Matters of average, and incl T.% also the eecretary Of the M{arine Isurance Society. ey united in epinion that in policies of insurance "kentledge" was sPsavs treated t a par;t of tue thie. They stted that theyrhad neverkno it t be separdtele insured or held liablc to generl tverage, which, at was contended, it would have been if it had not been cowsidered as included inl the policy. f oerd JxatBEhat in summing up the evidence, s id it was sdmitted in this case that there had been a total lees; and the qucstion- wras whether the defendant was to have credit for thesalvage of the"kentledge," xnd that depended on whether it ws covered by the wdlicy as parteof the ship. It appered that the " kentledgei' was used to navigate the ship, though it was soentimes not necess ry. Still, when it was necessary it seemed to-be a part of the ship as much as anchors ana ropes If it was not a wrt of the ship, it wu a part Of tae cip, ancl as such slould be separately insured but none of the witnesses had ever known an instanee of its being sepirately insured, so that if not covered by the insurance of the ship it had always been altogether uninsured. If it vas not part of the ship, it would be Liable to generxl average, for everything on board must contribute; but such a contiution hadl never been heard of. In the p resent case, if the vessel had gone on to China, the " kentledge" would have been necessary until it had reIturned into the Thames. Whsen the ship was sold the " kentledge" also was sold as part of thesinp;and thevidence which had been given for the defendant s very strong to show that it was generally so considered, for the witnesses all stated-that they had never known an instane where it bad been separately insured, or bad contributed to general average. The jury found the verdict for the defendant, subject to a reference as to the value of the " kentledge," upon which would ultimately depend how the verdict should be entered, whether for the plaintiff or defendart. SECOND COURT. (SiUingJ at Aisi Prius, 6eforc fr. Ju.ticc WIxourrAS and Common Juries.) The eases taken to-day were of consequence only to the parties interested in the cause. In consequence of the Court having to deliver judgents at Westminster there will not be a second Court of Queen's Bench at Guildhsll to-morrow, butthe sittings in the Second Court will commence again on Monday. SATUDAY, FEn. 23. (Sisttingu in Banco, afcr Term, at Westminster.) This Court sat this day for a short time, to give judgment in several cases which bad been previously argued. PA4RXER V. TEEE GREAT WESTEM1T RAILWAY OWIPALtTY. This was a special ease stated for the op: aion of the Cout, and was argued lat Michaelmas term by Mfr. Knowles, Q.C. (with Mr. J. 0. Griflitsl, for the plaintiff; and Mr. Draiwell, Q.C. (with Mr. Kleating, Q.C., and Mr. Un' thank), for the defendants. The pIaintiff, who is the well known carrier, brought his action aainst the defendants for overcharges in the carriage of parcels. The defendants were incortornted by the ;5th End 6th of William IV., chap. 107, and the Great Western wailway fromn Paddington to Bristol was made under that act. The public have a right to use the railway, the act preseribing the maxsrieuns rate of tolls to be taken, dividing them into classes, and fixing a maxirnunt sum for each class; but for the carriage of goods as carriers, as distinguished from "tols' for the use of the railwayby other persons, the act fixed no limit further than directing that the charges should be "reasonable." After the railway-the "- Great Western proper,"as it istermed-was formedseveral other railways were transferred to the company; and by the 10th and 11th of Victoria, chap. 226, which came into operation on the lst of November, 1852, the rates of toll were reduced, and a inaeinu,ue. was fixed for the charge for carriage, such for the goods traffic being divided into five classes For instance, the first class, the lowest as to charge, included { coal, coke, culm, caunel, ironstone, iron ore, pig iross bar iron, rod iron, sheet iron, hoop iron, plates of iron, slabs billets, and roled iron, limestone, ime, bricks, salt, sand fireclay, cinders, slag, and stone," and the snazimun toll w-as not to exceed one alfpenny per ton per mile, ad if conveyed in carriages belonging to the company, an additionalsum not exceeding one farthingtper ton per mile might be taken. And for theconveyance of such goods, including the tolls for the use of the ralways, and waggons or trucks, and locomotive power, and every expense incidental to such conveyance, the sum of one penny and onteeighth per ton per mile, if conveyed any distance not exceeding 50miles, and if above that distance, then a surm not exceeding seveneghths of a penny. Under both acts the charges for small parcels were left without any limit, the section in tho last act, and which is nov in operation, stating that, notwithstanding the rate of tolls prescribed, the company might demand for the carrage of smaRl parcels (that is to say, parcels not exceeding 5001. weight each) any sum which they should think fit, provided that articles sent in large aggregate quantities, aRhough made up of separate parcels, suhasbagsof sugar, coffee, meal, and the like, should not be deemed small parcels, but suchterm should apply to simgle parcels in separate packages. The company have aIl along divided their charges into two kinds, technicallytermed "mileage rate" and ntomna rate," the fonmer being much the lower, and applying to the cases of special contract where the company restTict their liability; the latter applying to their ordinary business as common carriers. These rateswere applied to small parcels as well as large ones, being cailed "parcet rate;" theyare much higher than the "tonnage rates," and higher than the maximum rates under the act of Parliament. The points raised were upon the tonnage and parcel rates both ofore and after the 1st of November, 1852, no question bein raised upon the miteage Tates. Although in the act of incorporation there was no classification as to carrige, the company issued a table, dividing the goods into six classes, and on the 1st of November, 1852, they reduced the classes to five, the number in the act, which then came into oration. The company were bound to treat asl persons a -e, but they were authorized to make special contracts for the collection and delivery of parcels, and any person aggrieved thereby might aye to the quarter sessions. Th lantiffcollected goods in Londol, and tooktherto the Padding. ton station in his own waggons, and then consigned them to himself at various stations on the defendants' railway, his agents receiving them at those stations. He had an extensive business, and on most days sent several waggons at shorl intervals. The company required Inm to deliver a ticket, called a I ticking-off note," with each load, stating the weight of each parcel, its distinctive mark, andeontents, and the plaintiff carr id the total from one note to the other. The company themselves collected sorae goods in London, and, in addition, they entered into contracts with Mr. arnis, Messrs. Blonfield and Son, Mfr. Wright, and Mr. Seaward to colleat and deliver goods in London for them, agreeing that they should receive from the consignors the rate of 3s. 4d. per ton, and payigy them out of their own revenue an additional sum of Is. 6 e. uer ton. It was found and stated that the collection and delivery could not be done at a less rate than 4s. lOd per ton. Nearly all the parcels sent by the platiff were small parcels, and the company charged each parcel separately, with the exception only of parcels delivered toGether and containing an article of the sue kind in essence and quality, as, for instance, several bags of coffee, in which case they charged for the aggregate weight of those bags. The plantiff Paid these charges under protest, contending that the defendants were bound to charge for the aggregate weight of the several parcels in each classwithout reference to essence and quality, and that the several waggon loads going on the same day by the sametrainshould be treated as one coni ent; and he also complained of the arrangement with =essrs. Harms on the gound of inequaliy The several points raised are fully noticed in the judg-ment of the Court. The Court took time to deliver its judgment. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE now delivered judgment. A gi et number of questions had arisen chiefly as regarded the charges made by the defendants, and the Court rwould take them in theirorder. After thelstofNovember, 185, the plaintiff sent to be carried several parcels of goods,each weighing less than 50ib. - the contents of each being of the smme class, but each tobetakentobeaseparatepackage. The defendants h3ad charged each separately, and the question was a7hether they were entitled to do so. The question arises under the parcel rate. The power of the defendants to charge depended upon an enactment which authorized the defendants to charge for small parcels anv sums they might think fit. It was clear that to be a smialll parcel it must not reigh more than 5001b. ; it mnstbe a single and separate parcel ; unless these conditions were compiied with the denomination of small parcels did not apply. 'imheplaintiff contended that the contents of each -were of the same class. The Court considered that the defendants were entitled to charge for each parcel separately. The only distinction between that and the next euestionwvas, thit the parcels were not within the weight of o001b. The Court did not consider that difference material, and therefore that queston would be in favour of the defendants. The third question supposed all the same facts, blut it was stated that the transaction occurred between July and October, 1852, and alluded to the 171st sect. of the 5th and 6th of WilliaM IV., chap. 107, and that enacted that the provisD requiring the charge for carriage to be reasonable should not extend to articles packed up in one large paekage, but only to single parcels, nunconnected with pareels of alike nature which might be sent at the same time. The plaintiff contended that wvhen he sent the several parcelsunder SQIb. in weight, and each falling under the same class in the defendants! classifcation, they were in one sense a single parcel unconnected with parcels of a like r nature. The Courtconsidered that this must be decided in favour of the defendants. The plaintiff sent three parcels of goods, e^ah being a parcel of coffee, and going by different aggons at short intervals, but on the same day; each was to be forwarded to the same station by the same train; each package weighed less than o001b. The plaintiff gave a note in:which was entered carried forward, as the goods- were not delivered at the same time. The defendants, however, who had no other notice of an intention to send any other goods. and certainly not of any other bag of coffee, placed each load in trucks ready for the train, that being necessary for their business. 'Upon these facts the gnestion was whether the defendants were bound to charge in the aggregate or for separate parcels ? The Court were of opinion that the defendants were not bound by that note, but might charge each package as a separate parcel- cer- tainly they would have been bound by the tonnage cassaication if the packages had been delivered at the same time. The defendants were not bound to send allthe three paclrages by the same train. The 6th question depended upon the construction of the 10th and th of Victoria, chap. 226, as to what were manufactured goods. On two several days after the 1st of November the plaintiff had sent at the same time several packages of eoods to be forwarded by the same train. The defendants bad charged for them as parcels The plaintiff contended that the whole should be charged at the tonnage rate. It depended upon the 49th section of the The Court considered that the term, "manufactured goods" mnst be taken in the popilarsense. They should exclude stationery, but should include, glass, draery, and shoes, and these mast be charged in the ag ate e th questionas- sumedthatthe gouhdenrcryhaoda h onv rates but it was said the defendants had charged beyond tint rate for loadling, covering, and unloading- The Court intimated} durnDg the argument, that the de- - e;- i fendants were entitled to a reasonable sum for such of those services as they performed; the case stated that the plaintif contended that the chargo made was unreasonable,-but the arbitrator had not found either way, the cornany would only bo entitled to p reasonable sum. The eighth and last qu2stion was, 'whether there wa an inequality by reason of ihc contracts with Metrs. Haims? The Court fully agreed with the Court of Exchequer ine tho es "Picy.ford_v the Grand Junction Rallway CoiupanyI (10 M. andA '. M99), which was relied on by the plaintifi but wrere of opinion that the present cue was distinguishable. The act gave the defendants power to make special contracts for col. lection and delivery, and with referenoc to those contracts the plaintiff Stood in the same position as the public. He milt t send bis parcels by those agents, and if they refuso to take them he might appe.L The judgment of the Court therefore would bc generaSly for the defendants, but the case must be referred back to the arbitrator to ascertain if there "were any overchrages wvith reference to manufactured goods, adopting the construction which the Court had laid down, and to find the amount which the plaintii would be entitlecd to. Mr. kiowns said, it woaia be important to have the option of the Court as to whether articles of the same kind such M sovaral baa of cotefo ent at the same time, should aged in the aggrepte s. Jutice Cor.mumr.-We have expressly said that it Eis so in our judgmnent. MIr. Kiowr.Es.-It would assist the parties if tho Cosrt would say whether the arbitrator ought not to find what would be a reasonable snur for loading Ho has expressed some difficulty with reference to it. MIr. Justieo COnF.BIncn.-Tho parties are not before the Court, and the question must depend upon the order of reference. Mr.KsOWLMS.-After we have been beforo the arbitrator, we can come before your Lordship if any difficulty arises. MIr. Justice CoLEswoz.-Certsinly. THiONPSONs V. HOPr P.. The sole question in this case was, whether in a time policy of insuranee upon a ship a warranty of seaworthiness was to be implied. Lord CAmr.xLr, Mr. Justice COLERIDGE, and Mr. 3ustice WIGn'nuL£N were of opinion that in a time policy a warranty of seaworthiness vwas not to be implied. The plaintiff would, therefore, be entitled to judgment upon the first two issues. The third plea alleged that the wrongful act of the plaintiffled to the damage, inasmuch as he sent the ship to sea without a master, and with an insufficient crew. hat plea operated as a bar to the action, and judgment on that plea must be for the defendant. MIr. Justice ERLE dissented from the judgment. Judgment on the first and second issues for the plaintiff and on the third for the defendant. (Sittings otatitirits, at GasidihAtt 6cforc Iord, CANBI:L and a Special Jhlry.) p55! V. CA34pBELL AiND OTHERS Tfr. Sesieant Thomas and Mr. H. Hodgson appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Watson, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty for the defendant. The trial of this cause, which began yesterday, was concluded this day. The plaintiff, John Pym, was the patentee of certain "improvements in machinery for grinding auriferous and other ores, and separating the metal therefrom," and he sued the three defendants, I. J. R. Campbell, J. T. MIackenzie, and R. P. Pritchard, to recover damages for their refusal to accept an assignment of an interest of threeeighths in tho patent. It appeared from the statement made by the plaintiSf, that on t lGth of January, 1854, he was introduced by a minmng agent to the defondant Campbel, who, having examined the model, agreed to become the purchaser of one quarter share in the plaintiff's patent for the sum of 5O0t. The twvo other defendants were present, and seemed to take an interest in the invention, and as the result each of the parties agreed to Purchase one-eighth share for a total sum of 800t. Sn agreement was thereupon signed, and 51. paid by tho defendant CampbelL The plaintiff subscribed the foDvowing postscript to the agreement :-" In reference to the above agreement, and in consideration of 51., I engage within two days to execute the legal documents to tho satisfaction of your solicitor, to complete the title to your respective interests agst your nanmes." The defendants having signed the agreement, which was executed in duplicate, were very anxious to have a machine made without delay, and, for that purpose, waited lupon Mr. Abernethy, an engineer; but that gentleman e.xpressed his disapprobation of the machine, and said the defendants were very foolish to buy such a patent, for he could make a machine of a similar kind without a patent. The parties -met again the next day, and the doendant CampbeD was willing to have drawn a check in payment of the amount, saying that he did not thinrk they ought to be swayed entirely by Mr. Abernethy's opinion; but, as the other defendants opposed his doing so,tho monoy was not paid and the present action was brought. The plaintiff, on cross-examintion, stated that he was now a prisoner in White-cross-street Prison, where he had been once before, and he distinctly denied the suggestion I which was made, that when the agreement was signed it was op the understanding that it was not to take effect unless the machine was approved of Mr. Abernethy. Mr. WAiTSOx applied to the Court to nonsuit the plaintiff apon the ground that he had sued the defendants on a joint contract to accept an assignment of three-eighths of the invention, whereas the evidence was that each had agreed to purchase one-eighth only. Lord C,UIPBELL declined to nonsuit, but reserved the point. Mr. WATSONc then called all the defendants, who stated that the contract was made subject to the invention being approved by Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Abernethy- and that though MIr. Ferguson, after examining the modei, had said, that"'ifitwas rginal,itwas a nice thing," it had never been approved by fr. Aa=rnethay Mr. Abernethy was also called, and said that there was no novelty in the invention. He contradicted a statement madeby the plaintiff as to the object for which the parties waited upon him, which he said was not to get a machine made, for he never made a machine, but to obtain his opinion of the patent, which was unfavourable. Mr. Serjeant TsoSsAs having replied, Lord CQnaBELL said, the question for the jury was whether, previous to the signing of the agreement, the plaintiff had told the defendant that it was only to take effect in case Mr. Abemnethy approved the invention. If he had done so, his Lordship thought the defendants were entitled to a verdict. Ris Lordship then read over all the evidence on both sides. The jury found a verdict for the defendants. STATE OF E COURT. In the course of the day the court became insufferably hot and close, arising partly from a want of ventilation, and partly, as it appeared, from the escape of foul air into the court from the lowvr regions. Lord CA,IPRELI gave orders that the doors and windows should be opened in order that the air might be changed. Eut his lordhi/sorder not being attended to it became necess to adlomni the court. Lord CNTf BB said, the state of the court was such that he felt it impossible to go on. He would, therefore, adjourn the court till it could be ventilated. This was accordingly done, and all the doors and some of the windows having been thrown wide open for five or ten minutes business was reumed. We may here observe that the state of the courts hasbeen a constant subject of complaint during the present sittings, but notattentioeemto be paid to any complaints, however well founded. S OiHV LOVER. 31r. O'ralley, Q.C., Mr. Hawkins, and Dfr. F. N. Lords arpearedforthe plaintiff; M. M. Chambers, Q.C., Mr. Creasy, and Mr. }arry for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action described himself as a dealer in metal, living at No. 2, Spa-cottages, Clerk-enwehl, and hC sued the defendant, Thomas Glover, his late master, to recover damages for false imprisomnent and slander. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and also a plea of justifihcation. It appeared that the plaintiff had been in the employ of the defendant as time and gate keeper, and as an agent for the purchase of metal, from March, 1854, to April, I 55, when he was discharged for carrying his own metal in his master's cart. After his discharge the defendant caused him to be arrested at 11 o'clock at night, at his house at Clerkenwell, and tal-en to the stationhouse ont a charge of embezzlement. The defendant searched the plaintiffls house, but found nothing; and he also several times searched a shop which the plaintff used in a metal business which be carried on of his own, but claimednothing. The plaintffwas taken before a magistrate upon acharge ofembezzling theproduae of some leather cIttingsbelonetagtohismaster, which ho had sold; and at the request of the defendant, who said he could bring forward many more charges a ainst the plaintiff, hewas remanded for a weel He was agan remanded at the defendant's request, but no other charge being brought forward the plaintiff was committed, tried, and acquitted. Theplaintiffnow swore that he had purchased the eather cutting in question frmm the defendant's brother; and other witnesses proved the slander uttered by the defendant, charging the plaintiff with having frequently robbed him. Several witnesses were called for the defence in support of the lea of justification. The defendant, his brother, and the suopman all swore that they had not authorized the plaintiff to buy the leather cuttings on his own aeceount, but they contradicted eneanotherinsomo material particulars. Lord CASIIPnEnr having summned up the evidence, The jury retired at 6 o'clock to consider their verdict;* at half-past 6 they returned into court with a verdict for the plaintiff,-damages 5l.

(JCIore AMr. Jostfe CPOWDER and a Sneciar Jumr',A 11his case was called on this morning, but after a lengthened consultation between the learned leaders on each sido it was announced that this multifarious and complicated litigation was entirely put an end to by the agreement which had just been concluded. The Foreman of the Jury said that he was desired to express the thanks of the ury to Messrs.

I C013RT OF EXCHEOTR- -mm 99 THE NION STEAM COLIER COMPANY V. T cTmPv. (Sttings at Nisi1Priust befor c 1CH BARO and Spcci .Turieg. at Guildhall.) Mr. Montague Smith, Mr. Barstow, and Mr. RI. James vere counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Keating, Mr. Lush, and Mr. Beahby appeared for the defendants. The plaintis sued in this action to recover damages estiMated at 3,O000. from the defendants, who are engineers, for the non-completion of two iron screw colliers within the time stipulated by their contract. It appeared that at the time when the contract was made a reat emcd had sprung up for a regular and large supply of coals to the mail and other steamers frequenting the rpidly.ris'ng porb of Southampton, and the Union Steam Collier Company having been got up for the supply of that demand, they bounn the defendants to construet and deliver two iron colliers on the 26th of June, 1854. After tho contract was made agreatpreSs ae toseinthelabour-maerketl and the defendants, though the ships were ready, were mnabloto Pat in the engines, go that the vessels were not deliveredtill ate in the autumn, when tho defendants preferred a demand for extras occasioned by the alleged exoessive masts and rieg insisted on by the company. This demand was not satisfied, and after a while the company preferred complaints against the defendants of losses allegd to have been anxtaled by reason of the deLay abovessentioned it appearing that the plaintiffs had host the opportunity of chrering these two vessels, as they had others, to the epvernment as transports, the aesult oE such charters being tnet thee had been enabled to declare a dividend of 2wn per ecnt, for tce half-year on their cxistinz vessels. The dweendants dis. puted this chiai, and hence this action. The CEIIE BAIIoN throughout the cause expressed it to boehis opinion that the damages mnust be confined to the Iccacs which were sustained in the wrant of the ordinary oceupation for which the vessels in question were required tnder the contract, and held that tho extraordinary profits which would have arisen from their conversion into Go. vernment transports could not influence the verdict. Tho 'ury eventually retured a verdict for the plaintifs Ifor 1,3DOZ, z ~ ~ ~ LCBOn V. FOUER. Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. Bovill, and Mr. Malcolm were counsel for the plaintiff; Sir F. Thesiger, MSr. H. 11, aud Mr. Aspland were counsl for the defendants. The plaintiff and defendant are large ylove-mak-ers, and this was an action directed by a Court of Chancery to try the question whether the latter had pirated the trade marrk on certain gloves invented by the former and styled tho '" Dauphine glove." The cause at one time threatened to occupy a vast portion of the day or more, hut at the suggestion of the learned judge the parties, who were represented to be on the boeat possible terms, ag reed to arrange their differences; all that tranpired was that a juror wfas withdrawn. IIALL DARE V. HEATICOT Mr. Serjeant Shee, Mr. Allen, and Mfr. P. Francis appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Scrjeant Channel, Mr. Hender son, and Mr. Bullar eppeared for the defendant. This was an action for trespass to two marshes in EAsex, to which the defendant pleaded a right of way for 20 and 40 hyears, an immemorial one, a right of way of necessity, and a right of way by lost grant. When the counsel for the defendant, on whom lay the onus of proof, was olenint the case Mr. Serjeaut Channel, to save tbme in proof, admitted that a right of wav of necessity eisted over the plaintiff's two marsLhes to other marshes of the defendant's, but stated that it had onlyexisted for certain purposes, such as the adrnissionof cattletothe defendant'slands; hut that sinceothe defendant had erected a house on his farm that litnited way had been converted into a larger one for carts and horses,in fact, for all purposes. The CIrar BARtoN said that he thought the leanred serjeant had indeed saved time, as, in his opinion, ho had admitted his client out of court Much legal discussion then arose between the bench and the bar as to the legal rights of the parties, which termainated in a verdict being directed for the defendant, subject to future discussion.

This wss a business of granting letters of ndminisaration of the goods of Constantia Campbell late of 24, Comber. land-street, St. MIarylebone, widow, described in the cause as Constantia Corloy, wife of John Corley, formerly Camp. bell, widow, to Mr. Corley, her alleged husband, and was promoted by him against Mr. Alexander Francis Campbell, her only ehild. The suit has been pending before the Courb nearly five years, duning which there have been two appeals to the Judicial Conmittee of the PrivyConncilj; the pleadings wero very pengthy, and the exhibits and evidence extremely voluminous. The following are the principal facts in the case. The deceased died at Brighton on the 11th of January, 1851, aged 81, leaving personal property valued at about 7,000g. She was also entitled for life, under the will of her father, Mr. Francis Gosling, which was proved on the 8th of September, 18W0, to the interest of 12,50W. Three-and-a-quarter per- Cent, Annmmties. The latter smn was bequeathea at her decease to her issuo absolutely, subject, however, to a life interest in the dividends in favour of any husband Ehe might leave her surviving. On the 7th of M1ay, 1810, the deceased, then Miss Gosling, intermarriad vith Captain Alexander Campbell, of the Royal Artillery, but who was subsequently promoted to the rank of major. lIe dieed on the 7th of May, 1819, leaving by her an only child, the party in this cause. On the death of MErs. Campbell, otherwise Corley, no will was fotud, and her son, as alleged by him, as a matter of course, assumed that he succeeded to the property of his mother, and to that bequeathed to him by the will of his grandfather, when MIr. Corley, a barrister-at-law, of Gray'sinn, came forward and stated that he had been married to her in June, 1850, at tho Register-office of marriaes, in the district of St. Lauylebone. Down to the time of her death, as asserted by the son, the deceased acknowledged and was known by no other name than lrs. Campbell In that name she continued to sign checlks, and in every resect to transact business as a femme rote. She gave no intunation of her inarria,Cto her son or her servants, or any of her nnnerous bn ighly respectable circle of acquaintances. Mr. Corley became acquainted with her in Paini 1845, renewed the acquaintance, which had been dropped, in l147, and from tthat time down to her death continued to visit her as a friend. Though the deceased continued to reside with her three servants in Cumberland-street from the preriod of the alleged marriage until the 6th of August, when she proceeded with her servants for the autumn to Brighton, yetMr. Corley never slep tat her houseintown, and only for two or-three nights together at Brighton, and then on a different floor from thedeceased's. To the period of her deathhecon. tinued to occupy chanmbers in Gray's-inn as a single man, and to be received as such at the deceased's house and elsewhere. In an slleo"tion given in by Mr. Corley it was pleaded that the afection of the deceasedfor her son had been gradually diminishing for some years before her death, particularly in and after the year 1846, in consequence of his nisconduct and of his violent and outrageous behaviour to her. Several specific instances were set forth:-that the ldeccased, being of sound mind, expressed to several persons, after 1846, an intention of seeking in mariage that comfort and security of which, througb the conduct of her son, rhe expressed herself as being undeservedly deprived; that after 1845, the deceased and Mr. Corley were on terms of intimacy and friendship - and in 1848 and 1849, being in full possession of all her mental faculties, she proposed to Mr. Corley that he should marry her, and repeatedly entreated hini so to do, and to which he assented; that the intimacy between the deceased and Mr. Corley having been temporarily&interrupted, on tho 27th of September, 1849, she wrote him by post expressing a wish for its renewal ; that lr. Corley aving been requested by the deceased to fix the day of their maniage, and having fixed the 17th of June, she stated that day would be inconvenient, but offered to bein readiness on the 19th - that lhe cohabited with her at Brighton, but it was prevented from being more continuous than it was by the deceased declaring that Mr. Campbell had threatened her with personal violence; that it waswith the consent of Mr. Corlcey that she signed her checks in her former name of Campbell; that in consequence of the violence of Mr. Campbell towards the deceased, and the fears and alarms which she expressed for her personal safety and that of MIr. Corley, she arranged that the marriage should be strictly concealed for a time until a convenient opportunity should occur of solemnizing it according to the rites and cerernonies of the Roman Catholic Church; andtherefore, inthepresence of third persons,they conducted themselves with a view to such concealment. A further plea was then given in on behalf of Mr. Campbel, denyig the diminution of his mother's affection for him, and alleging that from first to last it could not be exceeded by any mother; that frorm the years 1835 to 1850 Mrs. Campbell, together with her servants, resided with him at his hious for about six months in each year; that she was fearful lest he should injure his property by various mechanical pursuits in which he was greatly desirous of success; that he could not bring himself to relinquish them; and, consequently occasional misunderstandings arose thereon, hurT which were merely of a transitory character, and such only as consisted with matual attachment and regard; that upto her death she constantly reserved in her own residence, in Cumberlandstreet, a bedroom for his special use, and when she hired apartments at Br hton, in 1850, engaged an extra room for hlm that she migKht not be deprived of his company ; that he evinced great affection for his mother for many years, nothwithstandingthe differences of opinion on certain matters which existed between them; that conntly to the hour of her death, and especiallyin her last illness, e treated her with much kindness and attention, visited her on several occasions, and was received with the greatest possible affection. When the case was called on for hearing, Dr. Twiss, on behalf of Mr. Campbell prayed the Court to allow the witnesses who had been produced inthe cause in the usual way, to be called before it and examined vivo The CouinT consdered that it was unnecessary, the only point at issue being the alleged marriage, and consequently refuwsed the application. Dr. JeRM (c with whom was the Admiralty-Advocate) appeared on behalf of Mir. Corley, and said, that it would be an utter waste of time to go into any other part of the evidence than that which Telated to the marriage. A marriage, whoever were the parties, took place at the office of the superintendent-registrar of the district of St. Marylebone, on the 20th of June 1850. They answered tri the names of John Corley, and Constantia Campbell, ividow; and it was proved that the ladvwas advanced in r The certificate was proof of the marriage. Te Sand writing of the parties who signed the entry ^' the marriae was proved to be that of Mr. Cone7 and Mrs. CampbelL The maan who drove the the office of the registrar, and who knewthem, estsblsbsc that they were the persons in question.

I JamesXenyon, aged 38, a respectable-lookingrman, a plasterer by trade, was indicted for the iansaugElter of Betty Kenyon, his wife, in September lat. Mr. Blair and Nr. Aston prosecuted, and Mr. Monk defended the prisoner. It ap,peared that 6he -ri:*ner lived at Blackburn, where he caried on the business of a plasterer, and also that of a publican, at the Victoria Inn, in that town. The risoner and his vwfe, in August Lst year, appeared to have had fre- uentquarrels ,arising,itwassuggested, fromthewifo's being given to intemprance. In the course of these qnarrels the prmsoner was shown to have truc- hi t wife ith his fists on the chest and back about five weeks before her death. On another occasion he had thrown a bottle of Einger beer at her, which struck her on the side; on a third occasion he had struck her -with a brush on the band; and he had als been seen to strike her with hisfiste on the face, in the street, using the expression at the time that abe was a d- drunken -, and he would murder her before morning. The deceaed died on the 3d of September last, the inme. diato cause of death being suffocation from consumption. A. post mortem examination discovered no marks of external injury whatever on the person of the deceased, but the lungs exhibited extensive disease of about a ycar's standing, and a clot of blood in the throat, proeeedings from the air t.bes in the lungs, wlich the deceased, fromn exiaustion, hadlbeen unble to get rid o by coughing and e,pectoration, had caused suitocation and death. An exa. mination of the lungs sbowed numerous tubereles, andthere as a large ulcer in the right loug, w,hich had destroyed a small blood-vessel, and from this the blood found in the air tubea had proeeeded. Twvo medical men-Dr. Marl-and and Mr. Morley, of Blackburn-gve their opinions in evidence that the violence to whEich the deceased had been subjectel might have aggavated the disease under whicbthe poor woman laboured, and havo accelerated her death Do, IWarldand tbonght it might do so, and probably would, but would not swear positively that it had Mr. Morley had no doulbt 'whatever that it would, pattly by the nervous shock and the reaction consequent upon it causing weaknes and depression, which would render her less able to resist tho ravages of the disease, and partly by the irritation caused by such conduct increasing the action of the heart and the flow of blood through the delicate and diseased texture of the lungs. MisLssm, in sumusing up, lelt it to the jury to sky whether, on the facts proved and on the medical evidence on those facts, they 'were of opinion that the death of the deceasedhadbeen accelerated by the violence of the prisoncr towards her- if they thought it had they must findhimu gilty of manslaugiter, and his Lordship referred to a dictum of Lord Hale as warranting such a finding. If, however, seeing that the medical testimony on the puint was not unanimous, theyhad any doubt that the deceased's death had been accelerated by the violence to which she had been subjected, the amount to'vhich ahe wouldbeaffectdby that volence depending on her degree of sensitiveness and refinement, or on the absence of those feelings, they must acquit the pri. roner. The j3uy retired, and after an hour's absence found the prisoner Guihfti. His LoRpDsirp, in passing sentence on the prisoner, sail that cases of brutal violence to women were now so commnon that he thought it necessary for the ends of public justice, and -with the concurrence of his brotherjudge, whom he had consulted on the matter, to pass upon the prisoner the heaviest sentence which the lawv allowved. The sentence of the Court was that he be transported for the term of his natural life. The sentence appeared to create much sensation in court, and concluded the criminal business. The causes tried in the Civil Court to-day were of little interest. Mr. Justice WIlles, after trying one cause, proceeded to A=pleby to open the commission there, leatving Mr. Baron to finish the civil business. APPLEBY. FBsnUARY22. Mr.BaronMartinandIMr. Justice Willes arrived here lastrnghtlate from Lacaster. Mr. Justice Willes,this morning, having heard divine service at the church, pro. ceeded to the Courthouse to dispose of the assize business, There was no cause to try, and the calendar contained thenames ofthree prisoners only-one charged with lareny, ard two with offences under the Post-office acts. The prisoner charged with larceny pleaded " GnUilty." Vlliam Brown, aged 35, a post-office messenger, was indicted for stealing a post letter, containg eight halfcrowns and a halfsovereign, the property of the Postmaster-GeneTaL Another count laid the property in Mmrs. ogartb, the postmistressof Bampton. Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Dykes prosecuted, and MIr. Scott defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prisner was employed as the lettercarrier between Asllam and Bamapton. On the 3Lst of January last Mrs. Hogarth, the postmistress of Banipton, wanted afresh supply of postage stamps, and requested the paisoner to write a letter for her to the postmaster at Penonth, specifying the quantity and description of stamps abe wanted, amounting altogether to 30s. worth. This letter Mrs. Horth enclosed in a piece of brown paper, with eighthalfcrowns and ahalfsovereign,and,havingnddrescd it to the postmaster at Penrith, wrapped a piece of string round it and handed it to the prisoner, requesting him to give it to the postmaster at Askbm to forward. The prisoner placed itin his letter-bag, promising to do so. This parcel had no postage sInp upon it, nor was it stamped with the Bampton postmark Mi-s. Hogarth had been in the habit of sending for stamps in a similar way before, the postmaster at Penrith furnishing the stamps and destroying the letters ordering them, without charging them with postage to the revenue. No letter contaming thn stan arriving next day, Mrs. Hogarth inquired about'them oftTe prisoner, and he told her he haa given the parcel containing themoney to another lettercarriernamed NichoLon to take to Penrith, and tibat he had forgotten to deliver it and had bronght the parcel back in his hag, but she would get tha stamps next day. The prisoner not appearing to perform his usual duties, inquiry was set on foot about him, and, no parcel containing money having been delivered by hun to Nicholson, he was taken into custoday on a charge of stealing the parcel andmoney,'and, on searching a bor in his room where he vwas living, the letter, ordering the stamrs and its brovwn paPer cover were found in a box without the money. The prisoner then stated to the constable that havingbeen met by acobbler, towhom he owed 4s. 6d., he wvas askedfbr the money. andtoolcit out of the parcel; that be then wvent to a publichonse and drank the greater part of the residue, and was afraid to face lfrs. Hogarth afterwvards. A few days after the whole of the money was sent to Mrs. Hogarth by the prisoner or his friends. For the defence it vwas urged that the parcel was naot intended to be sent by the prisoner as a letter, subject to the regulations of the Post-office, but was sent by 3Mrs. Hogarth as a private parcel, unsealed, which the pnsone undertook goodnaturedly to carry for her as a voluntary carrier; that this was evidently her intention in order to save the postage, and that previous parcels of the sam kdnd had been treated not as letters, but as private parcels by the postmater al Penrith, wohad not chaed postage upon them. Theparcelwasnot, therefore, intrustedtothe prisoner as a lettercarrier, and in respect of it he was not; subject to the Postoffice statutes, nor ;was the letter the property of the Fostnsster-GeneraL. As to the count charging a stealing from Mr. Hogarth, the intention to steal wvas denwied, and he had returned to her the whole of the money. Mis Losmimp having left the facts to the jury, The jury found the prisoner GuailEv Another charge was preferred against the prisoner of receiving letters andupernies for the purpose of buying stamps to put on them, and keeping the setters in order to pocket the penns. Forty-six unstamped letters were found ia his bone which he was now charged with dtealing. His LonDsmp thought it unnecessary for th'eends of justice to proceed with this case, and sentenced theprisoner for the offence of which he had been found Guilty, to six yea.a penal servitade. This concluded the agizes. To-morrow their Lordships open the commission at Carlisle.

The report, an absract of which has appe,ared in TAhc Timies, was taken as read.I The Cs aatar. said he had great pleasure in~ to theni that the dis-pute Which had Ieen g -41 nounforsom few wek ast betwcen the London ar'-NrtWstr, th ida and tllo Manchester am Sefelcopns aLnd the Great Northern had be~ir,' broughtd topa termn tion.

H 3 Peit er wanted toheiu.r tporejeie ovr thetact bn -t w,xas his duty to St,ate e-xactly liat bud ocetiz-red aud vLo more.Terpot.stieal the corresponadence jaithel had takenI ePlace Co thded subec with1iT theA laSt -six '"elm. He was ApproWhe~d yesterday xxirninr by a. gnulcanwho had taken Tain'ht interest in the V~'Ospenity of thekc~reat Northern RaitFwiy, and a fair and reaseaubio irittsi~~st in the prosperity d the other railways and was askad ny him whether he (the'chairman) would re.propose to ftbeir- opponeats the letteoi'r offer-which he (the <hi1rmiii)sybad made onx the Sth ol Slebruary? On thatt day, in conjunction -with Alderman Mfeed, of York, he made the followuiik- proposal. "The Gres,t Northemn Comipany atre reallytLo refer to 211r. Glvkiis,taue the re-distribution of the 'traffic conpri-ed in lils former award, and .of 't-e towns added thereto, end such other places as can be reached by the twvo pastiies, sucli as Hull, Bradford, &e.-, axiii which is all that issssow-'rally.in dispute ; the award to ,il4e from the 21t of Jawrary, 1856.1 That was the proipou3al. they made to thete, together with a memorandum -svhich the deputattion &Zl not, consider acceptable, and which was declined and tlI~ parted. He was asked yesterd aY morning if he would renew that proposal ? He said, " No. really I cannot ; it hiss been proposed once and rejected; I don't presume tofhil fault with the parties for rejecting, but cannot ronew it." Hewa then- askled if he Would accede Lie the proposal if it was mavde to him? He said, 'I wil reserve my answer until the prposal is M&Mi." (Hear-, hear.) In the course of the day when th-, board was sitting, adoueteacl the same as 'shat to which he had referred was sent to himi, signe-& by the M1arquis of Chnndos, Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Ch#Lman. That dlocuiment he (the chairmnani) looked upo er s a proposal to their board, and accordingly he signed it on behalf of the cornp any. (Cheers.) That was a fact which ho wished to have clearly understood. He did not wish to express any feeling of exultation over their opponents; but there was no dispute about the fa-t, tha%ttheyv haliopoed to the Great Northern the acceptance of that 'whic7 they (the opponents) had previously refused ; and it was his dluty, as a matter of policy, to accept it, so that he atahoped the dispute between the' respective parties was ata n. (Applause.) It was intended to refer the miatter to Mr. Gladstone, if he would undertake the duty, his award to last for fourteen years ; and he hoped during that perod they would be very good friends, and do everything they could to get as much traffic for all pcarties as they could, andI he sincerely trusted thle arrane-- mente would have the effect of raising the dividends of t'lse other companies concerned as well as their own. In reply to a quiestion, he stated that what they asked Mr. Gladstone to do was, if he wouldt condescend to do so, to revise his former award under the atltered circumstaLnces of the case. It did not touch the priXvate agreements between the other companies, but left themn exactly as they stood. Mdr. BxLWrGs thought that Ur; Gladstone, 'in his formier award, had made a serious mistake in rega rd to the working expenses, by which they hadi lost i~ good deal of money. He wished to k-now whether the working e-xpenses were to be consideredfin the newv a-n-rd ? The Cscrsr.3rAie explained that the matter to be referredl to Mrr. Gladstone n-as to revise his former award, and to extend his arbitration to other Places which were not included in that award there was n5 basis fixed upon except the result of the last five years working of his owvn award to refer to for hi. md-nice andI judgment. Mr. Gladstone had taken a g-reat AZia of trouble on. a former occasion, and which he trused hewould notgrudge todo again. He (the Chairman)l thought it but fair to say, in reference to Mir. Billings' ob servations, that the matter of working expenses -was not referred to 3L-. Glads-tone, or touched upon by him at all. He (the Chairman) did not arewt r Billing's that Mr. Gladstone haid made agramitk;o the conti-ary, he had been ofteni surprise a eryloestmate he hiad made fivie years ago of thepooto hc the r,es.ctive railways would carry. ItwatrehtteGet NKorthern had catrried more than any onLe had expected, but they had no reason to complain of that. After somne further explanations, Mr. BrILreGS expressedl himself perfectly satisfied w~ith the explanation. TheCIA ea then referred to the report of the directors, which lie hoped the shareholders had done them the favour to read. The receipts of the railway for the last half-year haid, accordin- to his view, bee-n exceedingly satisfactory. They receiveci a larger sum every ha-lf-year thaLn they did on the prececding- half-year; -judging froni the past, and lookinig forward to the future he tlouight their property stood in a very safe and sound position.- (Hear, hear.) Thley b-ad got over very considerable difficulties; their net receipts would be better than they had been, because he believed they wonld not have to pay over to other coimpanies so iuuncli as they had hiitherto done, and, while thle agg regate receipts would be lar-ger, he trusted if they had pme.uethatthmeexpencecswould decrease. The working expeiises in their accounts appeared to be nearly flO per cent., which was in consequence of the sums they had to pay over to other parties. The expense of earning tllat amount formed part of the a;-.regate of the working expenses, and increased that item, while the gross reeits were diminished by the amouint paid over. FInfc, if tey were to gocarefuly into the accouints of the past. half-year, they would find that the working expenses of the Great N orthern Company did not amount to 44 per ecnt. of the receipts. They had made a new contra-ct for coke and other materials at a much chseaner rate than they had been paying for the last half-year, ancthe believed,. the percentage of working expenszes would be reduced. The disposable balance would allow of a dividend at the rate of (6 per cent, per annum for the half-year, on the ordinary stock-, on the B stockof 3` per cent, for the half-year, and on the A stock, of 2.t per cent, for the year, leaving a small surplus, which, in justice to the claimis of the A shareholders, they were bound to reduce as mnuch as possible. The plan they had resolved to follow was to keep the railw6ay in as good order as they could out of the current receipts of the half-year. It w-as in consequence of the railway being in tIle first instance well construictedl and admirably man-ged that it haid a superior clain. to others, and the travMln.- portion of the public acknowledged its efficiency by coming a. distance to travel upon it. The comfort of the carriages, and the manner in which everything was conducted en the line, had earned for it a reputation wvith the public, and he candidly told them that unless they approved of the present state of its efficiency he would respectfully decline to have any thing to do with the line. He concluded by moving the adoption of the report. I Air. G. H. PACIcE seconded the motion. Mr. 3UL1uxs expressed his satisfaction at the termination of the contest betweent the Great IYorthern and the ether companies, He hadl expressed an o,pinion the day before, at the mneeting of the London and 2North-Western Company, that no such competition as that in which they had been engaged should be entered into without the consent of a geeral meeting of the proprietors. He was glad the blame did not rest with the Great Northern, and he was persuaded thant no comp- ny could bear the effects of such competition ; for it was the last portion of the earnings out of which the plroprietors who found the first capital had to look for a dlividend, and if that wvere dissipat-ed nothing remnainedI for thesin to divide. (Hear, hear.) In assumaing the position of a railwvay reomr he had not done so to findl fault or enfairly to cast blame where none existed, but his motive hadl been to elicit the truth. (Hear, hear.) He believed, if the directors persevered in the policy they hadi laid down for their guidance, that in a short time, instead of dividina miseraol e or 4 pxer cent, they would have a commercMi remuneration worthy of the splendlid property they had obtained, and of the infinite benefits it kad conferred on scciety. Mr. GAsqKILL called attention to the system of grantingfree passes, which he said he believed had a serious effect -sipon the receipts of railway comnpanies. He hoped that this boardwouIdunite its effortswithithe boards ofotbercoinpanies in obtaining a more equitable system of assessment to the poor-rates. The law mn that respect, as also in reference to the tax on passsengers and to compensation in case of accidents, required amendmient. The state of the law with reg-ard to proxy stamps had an inijurious effect on railway companies. Ale ome observations from M1r. TucicETT; in respect to a paragraph in the report, it was adopted. M-r. C. -NeceOLSOY, in reference to the correspondence a,ppendedl to 'the report, said, it was of vast importance to thei.nas shareholders to know that the conduct of their cha-irman with respect to it, from first to last,had been most highly tohis credlit, and at the same time calculated to protect the initerests, of the shareholders. He believed he wvas only expressing the feeling_s of the meeting by propo§ing--;i resolu~tion he had just prepared, "Resolved, that the shareholders at this meeting- assemkied highily approve and applaud the conduct 'of the cliairman of this company m his manly defence of the interests of the compny peding the recent disputes wT..h the London and Noth- Western, the MidllandI andE the 3anchester and Sheffield Railways; and beg especially to acS=owledge their gratitude to him for thus adding another to the manly obligations which he has rendered to the Great Xur!tiarn Railway Company." (Applause.) Itu-s6 gmtifying-toperceive that onefortnight's competition w.ith nea Great Northern hadtaughttheiropponents pmdenee, and that discretion was the better part of valour. T1hey esime propositpan which their opponents had before rejected. 3ir. BrLuJGs seconded the motion, which was put and cars-led unanimously, amid considerable applause. The CIMrI.rLw, in acknowledging the complinent, said he begged it to be clearly understood that the whole board had acted whhU bins; that they had been perfectly unaninmims upon tie subject. Formal reolutions were then passed, declaring the usual Aividends on the .5 per cent, and 4A per cent. preference .Jinras,3 per cent. for the half-year on the original stock per cnt. for tLe half-year on the B stock, making for the hsaile year G per cent., as guaranteed by the A stock; -and ,t' te rate of 2, per cent. upon the A stock as the result of tJ.e 7nar after paymeut of G, per cent. to the B stock. 'llme CHrAsIRAN then proposed a resolution, authorizing tIme dirastors to expend annually a sum not exceeding 200 in rexnianarating a clergymnan, for conducting Divine service, and givirg~ spiritual inatsttetion to the company's servants at Doncaeter. This gave rise to a long discussion. Mr. TcCizrr opposed the resolution, principally on the ground that the expense would fall upon the original and A &12reholders. He concluded by moving an amendment to the effect that the remuneration Df 200r. to the clergynan be omitted. 1r. siazLEx seconded the amendment, and uggestedthat thCe mo rLeJnight be raiedby subgcriptioa atDonecaster. :D.e Cirsls.e? defende4 the propoeitioff and 5<tended a ou ey had aperfect right to object to it vr.

The resolution was carthem Aresolution, authorizing the diree,tor to expend a sum not exceeding 230l. in remunerating s .choolmaster and schoolmistress, a providing books, &o., for instructing the children of the companys servants at Doncaster, was carried umnanimously, as w,as also one ftor repayingill2k, expeadedhy AMr. Denison in enlargingthe schoors at Iloncaster. The Csrannsr±L stated that he had been reminded by the general manager that, notwithstanding the agreement w hich they came to yesterday with the LondonandNorth.Western and the Muidland Counties, the latter had determined not only to continue the low fares for another week, but to reduce them stil low er. The annonnemdut was advertised yesterday (Friday) and it apsuhed tl fare for the nexrt week would be, froem London to Peterborough, 2s. :fistclass, and Iss second-class' from London to Yorkc, firstclass, 6s., and the secoud0c0ss, 3s. 6Id. He had done what he coula to put An end to that foolsh competition, and he had no doubt that a large nmmba.~ of his constituents wvould visit london in the course of the 'week, as these reduced fares would last till the first of March. At the commence, mcnt of the competition the Great Northern fares remained at the old rates during the first week, while the other:cpipanies'fares were at the low rates; the consequence was that the latter hatd fhUl trains, and those of the Great. Northern arrived in London ithoutapassenger but at 'the end of that week they "Sfolow ed suoit," ad the consequence s that the, Great Northern trs carried all the passengers, and the trains of the other companies wver empty. Mr. MiAmcs proposed a resolution to the effect that, in the opinion of the meeting, competition ought not to be entered into without the conzent of a general mueting of proprietors. W CstArnJncti wonld not advise the meeting to pass it, for, if such a resolution were passed, its effects wold bec to tie the hands of the Great Northern directors, while those of al other companies were free. The board represented 1u,0lO,OO,Ol of capital, and, if such a resolution were agreed to, they would be cornletely left at the mery of companies representing o0,000,f00. of capital If the heads of the Railway Rheform A ssociation did not act with more caution in bringing forard resolutions, he feared they would either fpa,l in their object, or o a great deal of damagne to the intoseats thcy proposed to 34rotedt. The retiring directox Mr. Denison, Mr. earff, and Mr. Pym wrera re ec-leted as was also Mnr J. Chpman, one of the auxditors. The nieeting then separated. NORTH LONDON. The hall-yearlymeeti,n of this company wasr held on Fridvcay at the Euston Station, er. 3. Scott in the chair. Mefr. H. Cepubb, the secretary, read the report, which stated that, at the desire of the proprietcrs, the charge for double-jomrney tickets on the line had been reduced to the original rates, but that it did not produce the expected spresl teeceipts forhpassenger traffic on the main line duming thephalf-yearhadbeen less by 2,2a54v than duing the corresponding period of 154. The sum of 3,0418 ., which made rup the gr°oss receipts from passengers to S9,2G87., arose from traffic in connexion with the North and SouthWestern Juntdion, the Tilbury, and the Eastrn Counties Railwvays, all of wvinch sources of traffic are less remunerative than the proper trafic of the main lin. Aithouigh some of the deficiency above referred to may, no doubt, be attributed to the alteration of, the f.ares, the directors are decidedly of opinion that the high prices of the necessrcies of life and the increase of taxation have affected the receipts fromthehpassengertrafic on this suburban line to a greater e.xtent tha^n on railwarys in general. They, therefore, see good reason to hope that, with the return of peace, the passenger trafc on this line will not only recover from its present depression, but will exhibit, as in former times; of prosperity, a progressive increase. The receipts from the goods traidic have increased by 3,447?. over theacorrespondivigsi months of 1854. Toere has been a consderalle increoase in the expenditurie of the company dsurno the last hall-year, ariamg mainly from the becometirexchnrge and the maintenance of the permanent weay. The extra expense of thoroug,ny repairing the overlworked steckimnl8l and early part of 185e the directors propose to spread over five hall-yearly periods, one-fifth of the whole snm to be charged to the past half-year, le.avinrg 1.0a? to be liquidated in 1850, and an equal su4m in 185. The engineer reports that it is necessary to begin to renew the rails to some extent, and to continuie this process periodicallyv until the whole line should he re?aid with the most substeatialo metal, fixed urpon the latest approved priariples T2e directors are satisfied that the result of this outlay will be to place the property in a g"reatly improved condition. The revenue account for the hat-year showed that SS,494?. had been received and 33,.530?. expended, leaving 24,964?., to whtich as added 2521 from the last account, making the disposable sum 2S,216?. From this sum was dedumcted a,OGlL for interest on the debenture debt, leaving 18,1.5?. available for dividend The directors recommended a dividend at the rate of 2 per cent. for the half-year leavig a balance of 148?1 fort te next account. The capital account showed that 1,279,87?G . had been received, and 1,01,802!. expended; of mhich 708,067!. was for hLnd and comnensation, 52G,605,. for works, and 67,084?. for rolling stockleaving a b.alace of 21,926!. due to revenue. Ten passenger engines wnere added to the workint stock dtung the halfyear,nmnaning thetotal number 20. The average rate of interest Paid on borrow,ed money was 4 2-5 per cent. The halfa.rly in moving the adoption of thereport, stated that the increase in the receipts for passeners since the 1st of January last amornted to 6821., and for goods to 762r. over the corresponding period of l h 5. That increase has on seven veeks' traffic. They had attended to several suCgestions of the proprietors, and adopted sonic of them. Alongdiscssion ensued onthe affairs of the company andmanagemntof the traffic,in which lr. Onyon, Mr. Parsons, 31r. Hierapath, t r. Beattie, and the Chairaman took part. Resolutions xere passed adomting the reap rt, declarno a dividend at the rate of 2 per cent. for the hall-year; reelectinmg Mro. mp. Glyn, the retiring director; and electing nr. G. Allender a director of the company. The proceedingsconclude with avote of thanks to the chairman and directors. RUCINGHAMrSHLRE. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held en Friday atrthe Eston-sqiare station, Sir Harry Verneym i the char.cmaiscagdi h itit h opn Ir. W. Ding, the secretary, read the report, rhich stated that the rent received from the London and North-Western Conipany to the 50th of June, 5ld5, added to 1,578?., the balance from the former account, amounted to 26,478? The dividends paid to the proprietos durig the hall-year amornted to 25,336k., leaving a balance of 1,1421. The dividend aould be payable on the 28th instant. The traffic of the line continued to sho an increase as compared with the corresponding period of 1854. The CAnieaLx3S on moving the adoption of the report, complained that the authorities of the London and NorthVestern Company had raised the fares on the line without consulting the directors of the Bncdoughamthire Company Hfe also complained that proper arrangements had not been made to meet the trains oa he main Immie. Mr. D. lictra ss, the Hon. t er. PlERREPONr7, and other directors. expressed their surprise at the statement of the chairman, and contended that so long as the London and North-Western Corn3ny sustained the annual loss by leasing the line, they had a right to do everything they could to reduce the amount of that loss. The fares had been all along ridiculously low, and, they wvere not nowr higher than other companies charged in the district. The company had no right to cornp lain so long as the rent of 4 Per cent. per annum was regolarly paiud by the London and NorthWVestern Company. Resolutions w-ere passed adopting the report and re-electing the retiring directors and auditors. T he meeting then separated. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Sat-urday at the office, 24, Old Broad-street, Sir J. 1V. Lubbock; in thme chair. The report stated that the wvorkcs of the line had been commenced by Mressrs. Smith and Knight, w ho were prepared to carry on the wrorks with rigour. The directors adhere to the bcelief expressed in their last report that the entire cost of the undertaking will be covered by the capitaL. A bill has been introduced into Parliament byan independent cornp.^ny for a railwvay from the Bromley station of the Wes,t London and Crystal Palace Company's Fasuborouigh Ex;tension to St. Mlary's Cray, which, touching a populous and beautiful district of Kent, is calcuLated to pro^ve a v-aluable feeder to the line. MIrZ Fowoler, the engineer, stated in his report that the contractors had possession of land extending one mil e and a-.hall from Becleenham to near the Bell-greenroad, and that it wras confidently e.xpected that the whole of the land required for the line wvould in the cormse of twro or three months be in tIme possession of the contractors. He saw no reason to doubt that early in the spring of 1857 the line wvould be opened throug-hout for public traffic. The accounts showed that 6.8751 had been received to the 31st of December laPst, and 780?. ex pended, lzeaving 6,094?, ofwhich 5,925!. conhsisted of the Parlia On te mtio oftheCaLunra th reortwasadopted.

The net balance is 23,9591., which would pay' to the holders of the first preference stock A dividend at Pthey rate of 51 'per cent. per annum. The directors proposee to' declare mCdavidend to this extent, but ud6t to pay it until they can do so without detriment to the interests of the co=nay. The agreement contemplated in AuguLst last fo working the line more closely in connexjon with the Lo)ndon amidNorth-Western and Mdlandl Companies failed finDecembea. The branch to Chipping-Norton wa~s opened in August last. The agreement forthe purchase of the Stratford canal (made ina 18416) is on the eve of completion. The- purchase- money^ is 108l5001. Proprietors holding 95,580. have agreed to take rent-harges for three1 five, or seven 3ears, at 5 per cent, per annum, redeemable at the option of either party. It statesthat, with the concurr-~;00 of the Great Western Company, the Board -' Trade have agreed not to pursue the con-, Or jn? y t icrhe '- dn tot!A aya _ y upenialties inurred ..22~dp tot_ end of the present month, and that the Great 'Western ] - 'h -'- O 4slscompany's bills inPFar-- - agrees. nosm zo oPPOse"rop furt)b - l -ment if confined to seeking pOweli- Zr raising -r capital to the needful extent, frther time for executing the broad gauge works, and the remission of all past p:ralties. The further amount required for the broad gtu;e works is estimated at,150,000?. The bill provides .,r raising further capital to the extent of 200,000!., for the completion of the undertaking. At present the net revenue is tAaen week by week to pay existing liabilities. The sum thus provided is insufficient to meet these demands. The directors will -offer every facility to any committee which the proprietors may appoint to investigate the affairs of the company. The capital aeomunt shows that 3,930,548. had been received and expended, including 22,0361. received from revenue. The revenue account shows. that 102,0171. had been received during the half-year, and 54,8761. expended, leaving a balanice of 47,1411. The assets and liabilties. are heavy, the former showing a deficiency of 352,017?. BRISTOL AND EXETER. The report of the directors of this company states that the gross traffic reeeipts for the half-year ending the 31st of December last, including those of the Exeter and Crediton and the-Somerset Central Railways, amount to 173,481t., which is 8,5981. more than in the corresponding half of the year 1854. The working expenses amounted to 81,5271., or 46-24 per cent. of the gross receipts, or 6577. Per mile on the 124 ailes of railway. The n=aber of parcels conveyed by the company in the past half-year was 173,478 against 106,348 at the corresponding period of 1854-the receits 6.525!. against .5,2841., showing an increase of 67,130 in the number of parcels, and of 1,241?. in the receipts. The balance of the general revenue account, including 1,477?. brought from the former half-year, amounts to 64,094?7 The twvo suspense accounts are 8,632?. still uncovered for the cost of the Devon and Dorset bill, and 11,4871. on account of the line, making together 20,1191. which it is desirable to write off as soon as possible. The directors recommend a dividend of 4a per cent. per annuam on the 2,000,0001. of consolidated stock-, which will require -45,0001., and to appropriate 10,0001. of the surplus of 19,094?. towards the extinction of those suspense accounts, which will then be reduced to 10,0191. The consumption of cok-e for passenger engines as 3,723 tons, or 24671b. per mile; for Zoods engines, 2Z600 tons, or 50'031b. per mlz -; and for pilot engines, 458 tons, or 95-60 per mile. -The locomotive stcek consists of 52 engines, and the carriage stock of 760 carriages of all kinds, of which 49 have been built in the company's workshops during the half-year; and 57 others are inecourse of construction. Thedirectors recommend the advance of 5,000!. and 8,100?. to the Plymouth Great Western Docks Compny, to enable them to complete the works, npon which ,000. has already been expended, and towards that object the Great Western Companyhavelent them 5,000!., and the South Devon Company 20,000?. upon the security of debentures. The South Devon alsoprepose to advance a further suns of 8,100!. towards the completion of the docks, in which the Bristol and Exeter hoid shares to the ansount of 12,500?., the Great Western, 12,500?., and the South Devon, 15,000?. HULL AND HOLDER1NESS. The report of the directors of this company states that the traffic receipts for the half-year endingthe 31st of December last amounted to G,899!., anid for the corresponding period of 1854 to 6,5691., showing an increase of 3301., but, as the latter period contained six days' traffic, or 181?., that did not belong to it, the actual increase during the past halfyear was 511!. The depression of the trade of Hull, and the high price of provisions consequent upon the war, have tended considerably to restrict the traffic to the seaside, or pleasure traffic. The directors state that they have entered into a satisfactory contract for the mnintenance of the permanent -way and works for seven years from the 1st of Jan. uary. It is intended to make a seventh call of 21. 10s. per share, payable in next month. The disposable balance for dividend amounts to 1,8900., out of which the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on 80,1751., paid-up capital, leaving a balance of 286?. The total expenditur of capitalis 141,3357 The revenue for the half-yearamounted to 6,898?.; the working expenses to 3,560?.; the interest on loans to 1,497?.; and the balance to 1,841?.' DUNDEE AND PERTH AND ABERDEEN JUNCTION. The report of the directors of this company states that the traffic receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of January amounted to 22,424?., the surplus of revenue on the Newtyle line to 403?., and the balance on hand fromn last account to 8397., together 23,6ffl. The working expenses amounted to 9,20G6., the interest on mortgages to 5,1031., the interest on other debts to 1,676!., and expense of loans to 119!., together 16,1051., leaving 7,5611. available for dividend. From this sun is deducted 1,3921. for interest on 1st class preference shlares, and 3,460?. interest on quarter sh.ares, leaving 2,70S7., out of which the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum upon the ordinary stock, which wil absorb 1,348? and leave a surplus of 1,300!. for the next account. The increase in the revenue over the corresponding period of last year amounsits to 2,7941. Under the opetation of the act obtained last session the financial affairs of the company have been placed on a satisfactory footing. The capial account shows that 7m34,94?.f had been received, nand 753,91447. expended, leaving a balance against the dompany of 18,990?. SOUTH YORKSHIRE. The report of the directors of this company states that the increase in the passenger and goods traffic of the railwvay appears very satisfactory. The progress of the mineral traffic as also rsy encouraging. The first six; months of the past year, being the only half-year preceding the one just closed within wnch the company has worked independently of the Great Northern contract, gave a p reduce from minerals of 12,147?., whlile the presenthas yielded 20,012?. The supply of the GreatNorthern has increased from 145,OiOtons to 219,717 tons. Thetrade to Camden-town is teadilyprogressing. The Birmingham trade has been principally t t the gasorks. Agreements have been made with neighbourin companies for regular transit by railw ay to Hull and to Grlimsby, with a view to promote an export trade to the continent of Europe. A regular traffic in coal has been opened with the district of the Eastern Counties R>ailway to the east through Peterboroughs, and with thle district of the South-Eastern Railway through Guildford. The supply of coal, from the opening of new pits and the increased activity of the older averkis, is now much siore than equal to the demand. The available surplusfor dividend amounts to 16,355?., which, after paying the guaranteed dividend, will enable the directors to recommend a dividend upon the ordinary stock at the rate of 3! per cent. per annum. The capital account of thc railwav shows that 1,197,017!. had been received, and 1,213,9581. expended, leaving a balance of 16,9411. against the company. The capital account of the navigation shows that 928,187!. had been received and expended. The revenue account of the railway for the half-year ending the 31st of December last shows that 33,216?. had been received, and 15,5S0?. expended iii working the traffic, and 8,456?. for debenture interest, leaving a balance of 9,180!. The receipts on the navigation fortlhe half-year amounted to 24,597?., and the expenses to 17,9621., including 5,541?. interest on loans, leaving a balance of 6,634?. BLACKBUPN. The directors, in their half-yearly report of this company, regret that they are not able to announce any improvement as compared with several preceding half-years. They repeat the opinion that the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company, if they intend to act justly, should puttheBlackburn Company on a footing of equiality with themselves-that is, that the saue proportionate increase of traffio should be allotted to the Blackburn Company wvhich the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company have, under the operation of their unfair agreements, succeeded in acquiring to themselves. The company is at present suffering, in common with other companics, from the state df the money-market ; but when the cause ceases they will not adlow their property, which is placed in a populous and manufacturing distict, to remain unproductive. The capital account shows that 1,040,513?. had been received, and 1,056,397!. expended, leaving a balance of 15.884! against the company. The assets amounted to 45,708?., and the liabilities to 61,592?.. The revenue account for the half-year endingr Dec. 31 shows that 22,961?. had been received, and 10,989?. e.xpended, leaving a balance of 11,071?. DUBLIN AND BELFAST JUNCTION.. Thehalf-yearlyreport of this companystates that the receipts for passenger and merchandise traffic during the haltf-year exceeded those forthe corresponding half-year of 1854 by 4,090?., the increase consisting of 2,438?., derived from conveyance of passengers, and 1,652?. for carriage of goods. The accounts exhibit a tot.al revenue of 32,429?. and atotal expenditureof 10,1683., leaving a net balance of 22,260?., by adding to which the balance brou"ht forward fromthe preceding half-year, amounting to 5,l3i?., a sum of 27,3911 is left avalDable for dividend. 5he directors recommend that a dividend of 17. 2s. 6d. on each share (being at the rate of 5?. per cent. per anmum on the paid-up capital of the company), less incoene-tax, be declared and paid to the proprietors entitled thereto, after which there will remain a sum of 8,103?. to be carried to the current lialf-yeafs account.

- THE JOSEPgH1rYV WILLIS. Thie 2oikwM , offliai id. ports have been gent to. the 33oard of Trade fronf the gensti- with the late offrcial i a .--lea charged stances of +`- --ogation into the eircum..,a.ne Af O ycollision vith the Mangerton nueV, bf the above vessel:- " MR. YARDr Y'S REPour. " Thames Police-court, Feb. 20. "My lords,-I beg to state that, purauant to the instructions contained in your Lordships3 letter, dated the 6th inst., assisted by Commander Robertson, -R., acting as assessor, I have made inquiry respecting the loss of tho Josephine Willis on the night of the 3d inst., and to report as follows "The Josephine Wilis was a British ship of 786 tons register, whisk, manned by a crew of 40, including all hands, and carrying 70 assengers, sailed from the port of London, bound for Auckland, lfew Zealand, on the 2d inst. . "Immediately before departure she was surveyed and in every particular approved by an authorized emigration agent. About 6 p.m. on the 3d she assed the South Foreland; the wind was south-east, the sty was clear and starlight; the atmosphere hazy on the water and horizon. Soon after passing the South Foreland the wind changed to south-south-east. The collision which led to the loss of the ship happened a few minutes after 8 p.m, the direction of the vind and the state of the atmosphere beingt hen as last stated. The shiB's course was W.S.W., the regular channel course to clear uingeness. The rate of sailng-all nlain -sail being set-was seven knots. Folkestone bore 9. by W., 41 miles distant. The towvn lights and harbour light were indistinctly visible. The chief officer, Kester Clayton, was on deck in command. The master was below; two men were forvard on the look-out. One of the lookout men now reported 'a light a-head on tle stirboard bow withaL' The chief officer ran forward fromn the poop and observed a bright light a-head, and, mistaking this for Dungeness light, ordered the helm to be starboarded, so as in his judgment to bring the ship a poinit to port, and steadied the helm. After a tune he saw a red light on the starboard bow, according to his statement, as much as four points, and very shortly afterwards a green light also. As soon as the red light and bright light were visible, theywere known to proceed from a steamer. The green light being in sight, and all the lights being visible, showed that the steamer -was coming directly on the sailhig ship; but, according to the chief officer's evidence, the direction was abaft the stem of the ship (see vol. 1, p. 102) ; the ships being now very near, the steamer's heln being hard-a-port, that of the ship, by order of the chief officer, was put harda-starboard, in order to case the blow. The steaimer struck the ship stem on, just before the main rigging. The steamer was the Mangerton, of 363 m tOnis 1egister, commanded by - Bourchier, trading between -Limerick and London, worked by a screw of 130-home .power with a crew of 25, earrying on that voyage about 40 passengers, 25 of whom were women and six or seven children. At the time of the accident the deck was in the temporary command of the boatswain, stationed on the bridge, who was acting second mate, and assisting in the captain's watch. There was a look-out forward, and also another on the bridge, and a very experienced seaman at the helm. Tho captain was justifiably below for a short time, with the irst mate, for the purpose of consulting the chart, to be prepared in the event of not obtaininr the assistance of apilot. The steamer was proceeding in a course BE by N. N ., under easy steam, at about eight knots. Seven or eight minutes before the collision a bright light was seen at an appaient distance of a mile to a mile and a half, about a point and a half on the port bow. After a few minutes this vanished, when the helm was put a-port. The light again became visible, and also the sails of a large ship, when the helm was put hard a-port, and the collision took place as above described, Immediately before the collision the engine was stopped, and immediately afterwards backed. The bowsprit of the steamer being foul of the main rigging, the ships were not got apart underlO minutes. I will now venture to express my opinion as to the causes of this disaster. This I do with the greatest diffidence, inasmucs as the question involves con,siderable nautical knowledge. It may safely be said that if the chief office r of the Josephine Willis bad not mistaken the nature of the bright light which he saw, and if he had followved literally the 'rule of the road,' s prescribed by section 296 of the Merchant Shippig Act, this accident would have been avoided. Considering the haziness of the atmosphere, this mistake, notwithstandig the disparity of the distanees, seems excusable. Havin starboarded his helm upon the assumption that the light seen was that of Dungeness, the red light and soon afterwards the green light were visible. In fact, the three hghts were together visible, and so as to seem to indicate that, by pursumng her then course, the ship would have easily cleared the steamer if the latter, instead of porting, had starboarded her helm. This brings me to wvhat I conceive to be another cause of the aceident-viz., the deficient liglht on board the Josephine. Willis.. This li"ht wvas placedon the bowsprit, and efonsisted of a lamp vith three panes, each shoveing a different light, the centre one being bright, and th6 others red and green respectively. This undoubtedflyis not such a light as ought to be shown when dapger is imminent. It, however, unfortunately ham pens that it had received the sanction and approval of the emigration agent who inspected the ship, and was thus calculated to mislead the commander of the ship into a confidence of its efficiency. Moreover, it appears that there is an ambiguity inthe Admiralty directionson the subject of ships' lights; one clause mentioning ' brightwhite lights,' another 'brightlights.' Ithink that itwillappearfromtheevidence that the lits of the steamer were seen before that of the Josephinoevillis; and that of the latter the coloured sides were imperceptible. The officer in command of the latter ship having confidence in his light would probably assume that it was -isible as soon as the others, and that the commander of the steamer would shape his course according to that of his own ship. Another concurring cause I suggest with great diffidence is the order given on board the steamer to port the helm, instead of the contrary order. If these causes all concurred in producing the accident, we cannot, I think, concludo that it was solely caused by the blameful conduct of any one in particular. After the collision the Mangerton proceeded a short distance from the Josephine Willis and lay to. Her commander, notwithstandiDg the urgent request of his passengers that he would proreed forsafety towards shore, expressed a detennination to remain to assist the damaged ship. He, however, had reason to fear that his own shmp was in considerable danger, and was compelled to devote all his attention to her safety. Two of tho boats of the Mangerton were lowered, not without difficulty, on account of the improper manner in which they were stowed and secured; and when in the wvater were found wanting in plugs and tholes. One of them, manned by two passengers of the Mangerton (very young seamen named Newbam and Anderson), proceeded to the Josephine Willis and rescued seven of her crew and passengers. The effedt of the collision on the Josephine Wilhs was a breach on her starboard side, which allowved the w ater to rush in and throw the ship on her beam ends. Proceedings were immediately taken to lower the boats; one-the lifeboat-was successfully lowered. Thisalso wanted its plug. Another quarter boat was partially stove in the lowering, but it was not rendered quite useless. There seem to have been saved inthese two boats 26 of he crew and passengers. The lifeboat, with a portion of the ship's crew, after having placed her passengers in the Mangerton; lay off for nearly two hours, within hearing of the cries of 40 persons clinging to the wreck, without an effort being made to afford relief. The chief officer was taken on board the Mfangerton, where he remained without maling an effort to succour the crew and passengels of his ship either by his owvn exertions or by commands or entreaties. It is true, he was at first benumbad from immersion, but from this he soon recovered. The second officer showed equal apathy and want of feeling. A Deal lugger, conimanded by the vitness Pearson, rescued seven-all that remained on the wreck. 69 perished, of whom 57 werepassengers, and 12 including the commander, of tho crew. "I have the honour to be, my Lords, "Your obedient servant . E. YARDEY ." " CirrAi RaOnERTSO'8s REPORT. "My Lords,-Referring to the 434th section of the MerchantShippingAct, w hichprovidesthatan assessor appointed by the Board of Trade to assist at an investigation shall, upon the conclusion of the case, 'either signif his concurrence in the report by signing the same, or, if he dissents therefrom, shallsi4gnify such dissent and his reasons therefor to (the Board of Trade,' I beg to submit that I differ from Mr. Yardley in the conclusion come to by him respecting the cause of colDision between the Josephine WVilis and the Mangerton, and consider that, so far from the chief officer of the Josephine Willis, who wvas in charge of the deck at the time, being excusable, the collision wvas caused by his wrongful act and default, and I submit the following reasons for forming that opinion, viz. *- " L That the chief mate of the Josephine Wilis, at the time of a light beingreported a-head, rather on the starboard bow, was in charge of the deck of that vessel, and ought to have known, from the bearings and distance of Folkstone, that the light on Dungeness was some 12 or 14 miles to the westward; and if the night was such as is described it was impossible to see so far; consequently there could be no necessity for immediately altering the course of the ship for the reason stated by himL " 2. That he should have carefully wvatchied the light, and upon seeing a red light ought then to have known that it was the port boiv of a steamer crossing or edging to starboard; that there was a risk of collision if they continued their respective courses, and have ported his helm in accordance with tho 29Gth section of the Merchant Shipping Act; they would then have passed on theport side of each other, and thus have avoided a collision. The evidence of M1r. Ray, late chief officer of the Josephine Willis, is confirmatory of this in a great measure, as ho admits that had the Josephine Willis posted her helm no collision would haotknpace. "3. With respect to the chief mate's evidence as to his seeing a green light, I cannot conceive that was possible until the vessels were so close that a collision vas inevitable. " 4. Wlith respect to the course pursued by the Mangerton, I think they did perfectly right in porting their helm after losing sight of a light they had just before seen a poit to a point and a half on their port bow, as they could not possibly tell the w ay the vessel maight be standing, which they could have done if she had been a steamer. It is to be regretted that the helm wvas net put hard a-port at first. "I am also inelined to'think that had a bright light, such as isrequired to be used*byallsaingvessels, been shown, the colision maight not have taken place. The steamer langertDn losing sight of the light of the Josephine Willis arose, n my opinion, from the latter starboardinm her helm, therebypretenting to the steamer a green lght, and that being a fainter light accounts for its not being again seen up to the timeofthecollision, as stated by some of the witnesses. The lantern inquestlon was fixed at the bowsprit end of the Josephine WliDis, and showred a bright light a-head, a green lghteon the starboard bow, and a red light on the port, certainly not such a lght as is required to be shown by the Admiralty regulations.. Iconsider, therefore, that there is no blame .to be attached to any person on board the Mangertosi as regards the collision. " With regard to the conduct of the captain of the Mangerton after the collision, I coincide in the opinion ex- pressed by Mr. Yardley, excepting that I consider him +- blame forhaving all his boatspinboard or' A - theboatswhich was ttoE' anj by - K; end one of . - -&--- .X. , _Tn bey which seven persopA- were save - neiner Luoles or even a nlrU tn 't water from coming in. This is notiQd ID * - Yardleeyp re port. "The conduct of thc jw6 MateU and part of the crew of the Josephine WillMs, after getting on board the Mangerton, seems to have been very reprehensible, no attempt having been made by them to go to the assstance of the persons left on tho wreck of the osepline Willis " There are four particulars elicited in this evidence to vhich I would beg to call their Lordlships attention:- " L The state of the boats and their being carried inboard, which is said to be very common. " 2. The particular kind of lantern carried by the Josephine Willis, and which is said to be coming into general use. "3. To the very unsatisfactory answers, given by the several witnesses as regards the lights and the rule of the road. "4. The creditable conduct of two young seamfen, passengers by the Mangerton, named James ewham andAnderson, who went in the Mlagerton's boat to the wreck and saved seven of the crew and passengers when no one else would go, andwho are, I submit, deserving of such a reward as their lordships may deem fit.

Bat there is an inveterate prejudice in this country a2ainst people of high rank with a low education; and when we see common soldiers writing letters that would not disgrace a general, and generals wnting letters that woould disgrace a common soldier, the cant inquiry whother the right men be in the right places comes nito remembrance, defyinm all attempts to shut it out. That General Sir Villiam eJodrington, H-C.B., cannot write a sentence in intelligible English is one of those unpleasant circumstances which the prominence of his positionZas made conspicuously evident -to everybody. But a repeated perusal of those remarLable documents caUed " despatches," which Lord Panmure with wicked alacrity insists on giving to the world "Iua-ct simp?c," has satisfliedus thatthere rS much more wautingin thegenereathana knoviledge of the ordinanr roles of grammatscalcoustrnetion,andthattheydAiseoseasha11ow,conlfused, peddling mind, the possessor of which is and must be unaequal to the high and onerousduties of commander-in-chief. let any one read the despatch of General Codrington giving an account of the destruction of Fort lEicholas, and say if there be not reason to fear that the estimate we have formed -harsh as it may seem-is not without oecasion.

But we may not pursue this vein farther. There seems to us tobe clear indications in these despatches of a want of manliness, of nerve,ofnmoralpower, of greatness-of those qunaties of mind which, in a man placed in General Codrington's pDsition, are indisvezsable. The circumstance that wo are hopng and praymg for peace should not abate our anxiety to epreusred for war, and we repeat again, wiith every emphasis that we can lend to the statement, that- while lord Clarendon and Lord Palmerston are concentrating their thoughts on Paris and peace, Lord Paumure might bo worse~ employed than in recasting in hismind whet he is justified in entrusting the prime command of our torees to this sentimental General.-ScoUtis7s Prcess OrnCnuS OF MxuRm IN ThE BUSIrES;E W , '.-A return moved for by Major Reed, At.P., gives the followdng list of officers in the lRoyal.

Z M WR ' l-'.COm - - This wretched criminal, who was to havo boef executed to-day for the mnurder of his wife, was reprieved at a late hour on Saturday. It was knowm that petitions had been Sent to the Government froDm a portion of the jury who triea the case, and also froma the prisoner himself and some of the relatives of the deCeased woman, praying for a commutation of the sentence; bnt no notice was taken of them, and it was generally considered, from the nature of the case and the circumstances: under vhich the crime was conmmitted, that they were not likelyto have anyeffect. Every prepaation was consequently made for carying ont the sentence, and workmen~ were employed duming the whole of Satarday in fixing thet usual barrers for the prevention of accidents from the pressure of the crowd. Theanost extraordinary part of thet proceedmg is the suddenness with whichthe executionhas been countermanded by Sir G. Grey and the unusual charaeter of the proceeding. The feelings of the wretched prisoner had been wound up to an extreme pitch. On Thursday and Friday he had taken, as he thought, a last farewell of his children and some other relatives. Even on Satarday morning he had been visited by some remaining members of his hamily, and he was faully prepared for the fate which he considered inevitable, and haA repeatedly acknowledged the justice of his sentence. The authorities received no intimation from the Secretary of State for the Rome Department of any intention on the part of the Government to interfere with the course of the law until late in the afternoon, when the sheriffs received the usual formal notice that the execution of the prisoner was respited during Her Majesty's pleasure. At this time the whole of the ontside preliminaries had been completed, and it was too late to take any steps to remove the barziers that had' been prepared, and yesterday be Sunday they of course remained during the whole of the day. Crowds of persons consequently assembled, and the general impression among them was that the story of the reprieve was a hoax, and the preparations that had been made for the execution con. firmed this opinion. The wretched prisoner was in a cdam and resigned state, but, when the news of the reprieve was communicated to him, he at first nearly fainted, and a considerable fime elapsed before he recovered his consciousness. A similar instance of a reprieve being sent so shortly before the day of execution, except under particular circumstances, and where theres adoubt as to the guilt of the party, hs never before occurred. (From tho Obscvre:.) In the case of W. J. Corrigan, whose execution for fhc murder of his wife was ixed for this morninj, the Secretary of State, after much anxious consideration and, discussion with the lcarned Judge who presided at the trial, has arrived at the conclusion tlat public justice does not call for the infliction of the extreme s.ntence of the laSv. The sucddenness of the act, the entire \bsence of any evidence of premeditation, or of any possible motive for it, coupled with his uniform Idndness and good conduct towards his wife, distin'sh his case from all those which have previously occured, and in which the sentence of death has been carried out. The jury, upon further reflection, expressed in a memorial their opinionthat the prisoner, at thetime of committingthe act, had been deprived of the use of his reason; and Nfr. Justice Wightman inclined to the same view of the case. The safety of the public from the recurrence of a similar attack will befully provided for byhis imprisonment for life. It may he as well to add that the authorities who have come in contact with the prisoner since his conviction, as well as those cho knew him best before, all concur in the conclusion that he was not a person lkely to commit a crime so heinous under any other circumstances than in a state of mental derangement.
ALLEGED MURDER ST PORTSmO .-A very shockmng occurrence, involving a charge of murder, took place last Friday night at No. 15, Elettering-place, near the cemetery, in the EIdie-end-road. The person whose life has on this occasion been destroyed was Anelia .sAnsell, wife of Wlliam Ansell, who is a steward inthe navy, andrecently returned to this country in the Albion, 9Q, on board which slhip he was captain's steward. It appears that Ansell and the deceased had been out together on Friday afternoon, and that she returned home earlier than be did. Between 10 and 11 o'clock a next-door neighbour heard Ansell and his -wife quarrelling, and soon after the report of firearms. Some neighbours thereon went into the houso and found the unfortunate woman lying on the floor quite senseless, and bleeding profusely from the temple. Ifedical assistance was immediately procured, but death ensued in about an hour. The police being informed of the tragedy, police-constable Fendlon proceeded to the house and took Ansell into custody. The latter told the constable that it was an accident; he happened to have the pistol in his hand and his wife touched the cock; ho did not know at the time whether it was cockled or not, and when it went off he was so overwhelmed that he did not hear the report. When he recovered himself he saw the blood gushing from her temple, andhe put out his arms and said, "Amelia, what have I done?" He ran downstairs, he said, to send for medical aid. The ball enteredajst above the left temple, -nd lodged between the right jaw bone and right ear, but here were some of the fingers of tho left hand shot awvay, as f iough the hand had been raised to protectthetemple. TheprisonerwastakenbeforetheBorounh 'gistrates on Saturday morning, but nothing transpiredbe. fore them, there being only a formal remamd tillthis day. It is rumoured that one of theneighboursheard the deceased exclaim just before the report of the firearms was heard, " Oh, William, give me time to mak-e my peace !" Deceased appears to have been in bed at the time of the pistol being discharged. There does not appear to have been any premeditation on the part of the pnsoner, supposing the charge, against him is true, for he and his wife had arranged to take possession of a beerhouse on Saturday, of which they had become tenants. In the possession of the prisoner was found a magnificent shrine, made of silver, ad wahich had been taken by some sailors from a church at Kertch, and from whom it had been bought by the prisoner. It is a beautiful work of art, valued at 400t. GEORGE BmiDDsP.-Last Tuesday evening, at the Institution of Civil Engineers in Great George-street, there was something new under the* sun. Contrary to rule and order, an oral lectire was delivered byGeorgeB'dder, On the faculty of mental calculation, illustrative of the peculiarity which, in bygone year.; rendered him a mark ofT wonder, like X;erah Colburn and Jedediah Buxton. .This faculty he prnounced capable of being acquired by many persons unter teaching, to the extent of multiplying three figures by three figorca, and by others to a greater extent consistently wvith the powver of their memory to hold facts; but that in his ow;n case the stress of mind became very great when greatly increasing the numiber of figures. Xor did he consider the faculty very advantageous beyond three figures. But all this teclnicality was a verysmallpart of the pleasure felt that evening by an andience more crowded than ever was known in that theatre of science for practical objects. We remember to have read years ago a magazine article on calculating boys, in which the writer laid it down as a kind of law, that one facultv absorbed all other faculties, like the snakechanged wand of Mmoes, and that George Bidder, having become an engineer, was in nowvise remarkable in this vocation. The critical faculty of the writer was certainly not remarkable. But one thing is -worthy of remark-that. Georgc Bidder and Xerah Colburn, after being exhibited to the gaping crowds of curiosity-mongers, both became engineers; one in England,joining himself tothe fortunes of Robert Stephenson; the other in America, -whither he returned with his father, a poor man, after the late James Mill, Jeremy Benthain, and Francis Place, had vainly tried to stir uip people here to a subscription, for the purMose of superadding uipon the natural faculty the highest lhnd of education, as an experimental test. He now conducts a weeklly journal of practicalscience in the United States. But the charm of Tuesday evenin'v.asotherthan calculation. It was the talc, told with modestW y and simplicity, of early struggle, from the condition of a labourer's child to that of a foremost work-er at the great lever of modern civilzation -the iron railway. The whole man was changed. We had seen him, known him, again and again, in Parliamentary committcees, fighting railway battles inch by inch, with a face as hard as tunnel rocL, with no outward indication that be had a heart within him, or any perception other than that of money to be gained. We beheved in him only as a machine for calculation. But Othello's story was not more moving tham his tale of life struggle. There was no oratory no trick, no boast, but an even flow of words without a fault in grammnar; all so true, sO simple, that the, very -words were witnesses to their own truth. The -world was gone, and the child lived over again without calculation ; and those who had never before recognized anything but a rongh and unscrupulous antagonist marvelled as they lihtened. It was the triumph of nature over artificiality. The brother who taught him first and last to count up ten, the blackmslith -whose forge he sat on with otherboys, and whose bellows he was sometimes permitted to blow, and his subsequent lifelonc attachment to his "earliest and best friend,' Robert btephenson, all presented a perfect picture to the mind's eye, and the speaker stood forth in Isi tiueC form, with the outer husk removed, a manlyminded Enlshman, -with calm philosophic power of analysis, and yet withal a strong gushing heart. In truth there has been in the lives of these two men, Robert Stephenson and George Bidder, the old heroic spirit in a modern garb; Orestes and Pvlades bent on railway-making -money-making also-but still doing the world's -workc and not with a view to obtain false titles to shame their origin. -Spedator. THE iN w LORD AvEr,xD.-At the rely moment that the House of Lords wvas sitting in judgment on the Wenseydale Peerage the Lonodon G(azctec announced the elevation of Sir Gilbert John Heathcote, Bart., to a seat in tie Upper House, by the " name style, and title" of Baron Aveland, of Aveland, in the county of Lincoln. It is worthy of note that on this occasion the Crown has conferred the title on Sir Gilbert, not "for the term of his natural life," but to him " and to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten." It is 'Well known that this peerage is a digntyto which the late and the presemt baronets have always looked forward as an end in view, and that. they have now their reward for the constant support which they h%ve given to the Liberal intcrest, father and son having continued to have one seat in Parliament for upwards of 40 years, and two seats during a great portion of that time. The late Sir Gilbert Heatheote, who -was well known in the sporting world as the model of an old Etiglish country gentleman, was one of the wealthiest L-anded proprietors, and represented the comity of Rutland firom 1S12 to the dissolution in 1841, -when he retired from public life: he died in 1851. The present baronet, now Lord Avelanl (his son by a daughter of the Late Countess of Dysart) was member for Boston from 1821 to 1832, and sat for Soutlt Lincolnshiro from 1832 t4o 181, when he succeeded his father in the representation of Rutland. Though a liberal on other points, it is remarkable that he always epposed the-repeal of the corn laws. He was born in 1795, mid in 1827 he married the Hon. Clementina Eliabeth Willoughby, eldest daughter of the present Lord WillonXhbv 'Eresby, Hereditarv Joint-Great-Chamberlain of gland. - is lordship has issute, a fanily of two daughters and an only son, now the Hon.
