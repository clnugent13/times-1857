MONBEY-MARKETaGd CITYINKBLLIGBNCE.. I l~~~~~~~~onday F,yezdag. Although all doubts as to the completion of the treaty of peace were removed on Saturday, the announcement this morning of its having been. signed was followed by a fresh rise of three-eighths per cent. in the Englishfunds, and the market at the conclusion showed a furthor tendency to improvement. Consols for money were first quoted 924 to 93k., and, aftertthere had been alternately buyersand sellers at 93 throughout the greater part of the day, the closing quotations were 93 to i for money, and 931 to i for the 10th of April. The next account is fixed for the 8th of MIay, and for that period the final price was 93i to J. The transactions generally wero of a very animated character, and a greater rise would have been witnessed but for an increase which was observable in the pressure for money. Short loans until the paymnent of the dividends were in eager request in the Stock-Exchange, and the demand in the discount-market and at the Bank oI England was likewise very active, India Bonds left off at 11s. to 6s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to g; and Exchequer-bills (March), 2s. to 4s. premium, (June) Is. discount to par. The expectation that the announcement of peace would be immediately succeeded by a reduction in the rate of discount by the Bank of France has been realized. It had stood at 6 per cent. since the 18th of October last, and is now put at 5 per cent. Looking at the fact that only a few days have elapsed since the Bank of France was purchasing bullion at a loss, in order to keep its supply at a point to prevent uneasiness, and also at the mania for speculation, which is now likely to rage with increased force, the step seems in some degree premature. There is every reason to suppose, however, that the natuiral return of specie to the country will be rapid, nd that under the most prudent course the alteraition would have been called for within two or three weeks. At the Bank of England the relaxation will probably be more gradual, but a prelimiinary movement must be expected almost immediately, since the reduction in Paris must exert a further influence upon the continental exchanges, which were already generally favourable. There was a further improvement this molrning of I per cent. in Turkish stock, and considerable purchases were made at the advance. The transactions in the Six per Cents. were at 99§, 98g, and 100 for money, and 100, 99k-, 100, 99s, and 100 for the account. In the Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock there was business at 1014 for money, and 102, 1024, 101g, and 1024 for the account. Sardinian and Spanishl also exhibited greater firmness, but the operations were less extensive. The general business included:-Buenos Ayres, at 59%; Ecuador New Consolidated, 144 and ; Mexican, for account, 20k, J, i, J, and 4; Peruvian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 79 and 784; the Three per Cents., 57; Portuguese Four per Cents., 494-; Sardinian Five per Cents., 944 for money, and 95, 954, and 4 for account; Spanish Three per Cents., 45 1 and ( for money, and 45Q and 46 for the account; the New Deferred, 25a, 0, 4, and 4 for money, and 254 for the account; Passive, 74, 4, and i; Spanish Certificates, 604 and 54; and Belgian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 96. The corn-market this morning was steady at the rates of M,onday last. The final quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening indicate that the completion of peace and the reduction of discount by the Bank of France have been followed by numerous realizations, the Three per Cents. having experienced a decline of a- half per cent.-namely, to 72f. 70c. for money, and 72f. 9Oc. for the account. Some misapprehensions appear to prevail with regard to the period after the conclusion of peace at which the augmented rate of income-tax granted by the act of last year is to terminate. An impression is entertained by many that it is not to extend beyond six months from that event, and the public generally will probably be surprised to learn that, as the law stands, it will continue tiU the 6th oi April, 1858. The increased duty was granted " during the war, and until the 6th day of April which shall first happen after the expiration of one year from the r-atifwatioab of a definitive treaty of peace." This ratification, it isstated to-day, will probably be delayed for four weeks-namely, t,o the 28th of April. The expiration of one year from that date will fall on the 28th of April, 1857, and the duty is consequently to expire on the 6th oi April, 1858, which will be the first 6th of April that will happen afterwards. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will most probably not avail himself of the peculiar extension of time given to the operation of the act by the delay in the ratification, but it is desirable that the public should be informed of the exact position in which the matter is at present placed. The suspension was announced to-day of Messrs. H. M. Marley and Co., silk brokers. The amount of their liabilities has not been stated, but it is supposed to be about 25,0001. The telegraphic accounts from China to-day are to the 15th of Februarv, and show a slight decline in the rate of exchange at Shanghai, wliich will lessen tne profit of sending silver from this side. The quotation last month was os. 9d., and it is now 6s. 7d. At Canton it remains at 5s. Old. The exports of tea to date were 63,588,3001b. and of silk 31,750 bales. The exports of silk, it is alleged, were likely to be less than had been anticipated. Attempts on the part of the Government officials to equalize the silver currency at Shanghai were still in progress. The accounts of the manufacturing trade of the country during the past week are satisfactory from all quarters, although a partial interruption has been occasioned by the Easter holydays, and the coldness of the weather has continued to exercise an influence. At Manchester the market has been steady, and the principal houses are fairly supplied with orders. At Birmingham the preliminary resolution of the ironmasters not to make any reduction of prices for the coming quarter has given stability to the trade, and it is also stated that the recent advices from America are less discouraging. In the potteries the agitation commenced for fiee trade with France has been encouraged in a manner which gives hopes of its extension. The Nottingham accounts describe a partial diminution of activity. In the woollen districts there has been continued steadiness, and in the Irish linen-markets the transactions have been numerous, with a good proportion of foreign orders. The Hamburg advices state that the rate of discount has again risen to 6 per cent., in consequence of a renewed export of silver. According to a telegraphic message to-day fiom Constantinople, M. Zohrab, who is understood to be acting in connexion with the Ottoman Bank, has olbtained a ifiman for that undertaking. It is said, also, that the finnan has been granted to him in preference to other competitors, but whether it confers any permanently exclusive privileges remains to be ascertained. The Bank has received a Royal charter in this country, and is known to be favourably regarded by the Turkish Government. Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in the stock and share markets during the month of March. Although it has witnessed the consumma- tion of peace, the range of prices during theperod has been less than in several preceding months, the extreme difference in Consols having been only 21 percent. The movement, however, has been af one way, the lowest point having been touched on the 1st inst., and the highest on the 31st. Railway shares have fully participated in the continued buoyancy, and many descriptions show a rise of betwreen 5 and 10O per cent.: FLUCTUATIONS aN THE STOCR AaN-D SHAR MARKETS DURING THE fONTE OFMAR. 185a:- Annexed are the railway calls for the mouth of April so far vs they have yet been advertised:- According to the report of the New Granada Company, presented at a meeting to-day, the operations for the first six months of the past year were satisfactory. The returns, however, have since fallen off through the mismanagement of the superintendent, and it has been found necessary to remove him and reinstate a formermanager wvho had retired from the company's service. The general net balance of profit is 4771., which it has been agreed shall be carried to the credit of the profit and loss account for the present year. The mines of Frontino and Bolivia are stated to be capable of great development. A meeting of the Linares Lead Mining Company took place to-day, when a dividend of Bs. per share was declared, and the report adopted. The result of operations is represented, on the whole, to have been satisfactory, but the profits are diminished through the heavy cost of transit to the coast. At a meeting of the Provincial Bank of Ireland this morning Mr. T. Chapman was elected a director in the rcom of Mr. J. P. Muspratt, deceased. It was stated that the progress of business is satisfactory, and that two new branches have been opened, one at Templemore, the other at Nenagh. At a meeting of the Wailer (Virginia) M1ining Company held to-day, the report of the directorsvwas received, and a committee was appointed to act with them in raising 5,6001. as additional capital to carry out operations. The claims against the company are about 2,0001., and, as someof the works entered into have not proved secure, a further outlay will be necessary. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the week have comprised only two vessels, one for Sydney, the other for Adelaide, with an aggregate capacity of 1,058 tons. The rates of freight exhibit a tendency to increased firmness.

THE COY TRADE. -. P MAXA .MN;A:L AY=N03n1Y T. MAC .1 1ist weeles arriv.ls of grain and flour were good, peas' alone excepted. Thit exports were small-viz., 170 quarters' of wheat, 17 quarters of cats, and 71 sacks of flour. The supply of native wheat was 6,gM quarters, the foreign beinj 24,661 quarters, of whicl. 8,000 were from India, 3,500 from Tlainurg, and the rest from the Peninsula and IIediferranean. The mornings show from Rent and Esser was fair. kt the opening, the conclusion of peace brought a calm, but the tone of the mark-et gradually improved, and business done was at the previous rates, both for English and foreign saples. Of country flour there were 15,016 sacks, with 11,176 sacks foreign, nearly all from Spain. Trade was limited, but no alteration in quotAtions was made generally, bat Nortolk-s were held in some instances at Is. more, The barley supply conusisted of 4,827 quarters English, anid 9Sa quarters fromq Odense. The few sampIe!s of fine ma7itinF that appeared were quickily taken at full rates, and the pnsces of other sorts were sustained. The malt trade evsnced no newfeatares. Of oats, the receipts from abroad were 15,715 quarters; from Ireland, 4,122 quarters; from Scotland, 414 quarters; with 2,008 quarters EngiLsh; in all, 22,259 quarters. Busi ness proceeded at a steady rate, without any abatement of price on good corn. There was a large influx of beans from Alexandria and Trieste-viz., 10,124 quarters, with 626 quarters from our own coast. The arrival of peas, exclusively Englisl, was only 513 quarters. The arrivals of Egyptian beans being anticipated, rates were no lower though sales were difficult. P'eas were unaltered. A plentiful sapply of linseeadwas reported-vi-, 13,5SS quarters, nenrlyall fromtheEast Indies. Crushers being greatly in wants no reduction of rates took places. The cloverseed trade has scarcely been so active, some rain being wanted. Tares are vexy dula, and cheaper. Hempseed, mustard-seed and other iinds much as lat quoted. The cold weather has checked the demand for seed during thepastweek, butthismorning therewaswas moreactive inquiry, and )prices of all desmriptions were fulIy maintained. There is a fair demand for most agricultural seeds at full quotations. lapeseed is lower to purchase for forward ship. ment. Ca-es command previous-rate.

Home, the secretary, read the iainutes of the lhat ancetig, which were oonfirmed. The report stated that the progress of the worklsad, nunder all the circumstanoe3 . of the case, been satisfactory to the -diectors. The works nowextend almogt continuously from the junction with! the London and South-Western BailRwa at Godalminig ts- aislemore. Ground has been recently ibroken sIso beyondc that town, and arrangements for a consIderable length of land at Liss are nearly completed, which will enable the; contractor to rommence the works in that neighbourhood. It is expected thbt the firEt section of the line from Godaliing to Witlev will be ready for tiaEo next autumn, and that ani arringement for tGe, working of the traffic conducive to the public intereft5 and satisfactory to the shoreholders will have been mader by that timae with one of the existing r:ailway cornpanies. the directors remind the shareholders that ever sincether inoorporation of the company in 1853 circunstances highly adverse to the construction of a 'new railway hav4. been mn operation. There was novw, hom:aver, a prospect of a favourable change, and, the directors were prepared toF avail themselves of it in order to press i.orward the worli to as speedy a completion as the extent it improvement ha the money-market would justly warrant. the directore wish it to be understood that their opinions in respect tci the intrinsic charaoter of the underteking remain unchanged; and that its completion alcmne is needed to demonstrate its usefulness to the G,overmment, auil to a large population hitherto insufliciintly supplied with railway accommodation, or altogetlier without it, as well as its value to the shareholders. ThAtt report of Messrs. Locke and Errington, the engineers, statel that at Buritom the tunnel, 480 yards in length, through the chlulk, is nowr finished except the faces. At fEaslemere siome hindrance Lhae c'curred from sli,s in the embankment, but nowI the work is proceecUng more rapidly. Considerabl% progress has been made at Vitley. Severn bridge& and the requisite culverts for the emibankments have, been built. Upwards of 500 men and 15 horses are nowemployed upon the works. The capital account to the 23M of Mahrc-showed that 108,789Z. had baen received oans 101,9541. expended, leaving a balance of 6,.1351 The CipumAIRk congratulated, the sh.areholders on the recent announcement of peace, and hoped, among other inestimable benefits, they wold find the. noney-market in k more easy position, sO as to enable them to raise the requisite capital to push forward the works wsith vigour, and to Comne earlier into dividends. They' were at present :in negotiation for terms of ar.rangement with other conspanics fo± working the line. TXhey hadposrer to formjn unctions with the South-Eastern line at Shalferd, and with. the South-Western at Godalming, and they hoped to make terms with one or both of those comPanies which would be satisfactory to the shareholdersand iiefiul to the public and the Government. It was daeirehle the proprietors shouldrefrainfromas;kingindiscreet questios onthesubjct and he theught they had very much better leave the matter entirely in: the bands of the directos. IrIr. Sor,omo?s thought they should endearour to open the line in the first instanue from Havant to Petersfield. Mr. BEST was of opinion that it was the interest of thn South-Western Company to work the line. The CMUn'3r.s explained that they had considered evel7 point, and that by an arrangement with the South-Western Company they migh't formnsuch a junction with the SouthEastern line as would save them an outlay of 20,000?. The report was unanimously adopted, Mr. E. Robins was re-elected a director, and the allowauce to the auditors was reduced from 501. to 251. each oer annumn Mr- SoLomo-N expressed hinself satisfied with the proceedings of the directors, and stated that he had full confidence in them. He concluded by moving a cordial voteof thanks to the chairman and directors for their able management of the company's affairwhich s carried unanimously. The Cn.IRA , in acknowledging the complimeut, vished it to be understood that he had not taken the chair as chairman to the company; he merely performed theduties for the present, as he was anxious to give them all the assistance he could, but lis other avocations would not admit of his being chairman of the company. The directors had very difficult and anxious duties to nerform, and. they required the frank and hearty suppore of the proprietors to enable them to carry out the ndertaking, in whichL they were all deeply interested. The meeting then separated. PARIS AND ORLEANS. The annual general meeting of -this company was held im Paris on Saturday. M. Bartholony, the president, took the chair. The meeting was also made special for the purpose of authorizing the directors to issue additionalcapitaltomeetthe cost of the extensions of therailwaynown corse of construction, or which this company have undertak-en to execute; toc purchase certainfreehold properties, centrallysituate in Par, for the purposes of this railwav, and of other lnes havi-ng their terminiain Paris; to form a grand central merchandise station; to sanction the cession of a portion of the railway of this company to the Great Cental -daily Corpany ; to rtify the arrangement made with the Paris and Lyons andthe Great Central Bailway Companies for the joit constructionby a3l three of a new line from PaSis to Lyons by C-orbeil, -through the Bourbonnais; and on other special busne3ss The Orleans group of railways is, perhaps, the most extensive in Europe under one management; it comprises no less than 2,266 Idlometres (14416 English miles), of wvhich 1,277 Ikilometres (798 miles) are now in full work; 89S ldlometres remain to be made, and are partially in course of construction; it embraces the richest and most populous regions or the north-west, wedt, south-west, the centre, and south-east of 'rance, radiating from Orleans, and brings the porEs along the whole line of tie western coast, from Quimper toBordeaux, into direct communication with the metropolis. The meeting was held in the spacious hal which forms part of the central offices of the compmny. It is capable of containing 2,000 persons. Owing to the plan adopted by this company of giving a jcton (representing six francs) to each shareholder present, there is always a full attendance. U pw ards of 1,400 shareholders werepresent at this meeting. The directors' report showed that the balance to the credit of capital account was 3,000,000f. (120,0001). The revenue account for the past year showed that a, very large sum was expended in the renewal of the permanent way, the invariable rale of this company. It was explained that the - company would receive upwards of 40,000,000f. on the obligations of the Great, Central Railway Company for the portions of the railway ceded to that company; that the New Paris and Lyons Railw-ay would be made by obligations guaranteed by all the three corapanies jointly; and that, in aUl probability. for the sake of convenience, -the whole sum to be raised for this branch of the expenditure, including the 40,000,00m, would be by obligations of one and the same form.. The preference would be given to the shareholders of the three companies in the distribution of this stock. The revenue account for the year 1855 showed that 57,378,27f.{2,295,14S&).had been received, and 30 %01,762f. ,2$S70l.) ernded, leaving a net profit on the workina of 26,426,95- |,7,WSl.). Of this sum 254875f. (10,195?4 was appropriated to the sinking fund to redeem the cap.tal 12,O00f. (4801.) annuity to the original concessionare; 1,S73,906f. (74,9561.) to the officers and servants of the company, leaving 24,296,176f. (971,447L)for distribution among the sharcholders, of which sum 9,000,OOHf. (3600301.), being at the rate of 30f. per shaRe, was paid on the l1t of October last, and it was now proposed to pay them a further sum of 15,000,O0Df. (600,000 .), being at the rate of R)f. per share, leavinga balance forthe next account of 286,177f. (1,4171.) The dividend forthe year amounted to S0f. per share, or la per cent. The report, and the series of resolutions proposed. thereon, were adopted un ously. Messrs Barry, Cochin, CailLard, Count Benoit d'Azy, and Dnofour, the five directors ret-iring inrotation and by lot, were severally reelected for five years The reelection of the auditors, and. a cordial vote of thanks to the chairman and directors, closed the proceedings. 1ANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, ANID LINCOINSHIR The vorling expenses and other outgoings of this company's railways (exclusive of the llanchester, South Junction, and Altrinnham, stated beowv) have amounted in the fortnight endinMxrch 23 to S,3921. 15s.

THE 1IMPERIAL OTTOMAN LOAN. Mr. OLIVEIRA asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer -whether the Government would sanction (in such cases as might be desired by the holders) a registration of the bonds of the Imperial Ottoman Loan of 5,000,00o0., 1855, underthe joint guarantee of England and France? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER replied, that the question related to a subject over which the Government had no drect control. It was a matter to be settled between the Turkish Governnient and the Bank of EnLind. The Government would offer no objection to such an arrangement as the hon. member had described, but it -was surrounded wvith greater difficulties than he probably was aware of. (EHear, hear.) MALT DUTY. In reply to Mr. Sroo-s-R, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER observed, -that under the present act the war duties on malt would de-termnine on the 5th of July next after the exchange of the xatifications for a definitive treaty of peace. It had been customary to allowr a drawback for the stock on hand at the time the duty ceased, and from this practice there would be mo deviation when the war duties expired. COUNTIES AN'D BOROUGHIS POLICE BILL. In replp to Sir J. PAxuxoro-, Sir G. GREY stated that the Government meant to proceed with this bill on the 14th inst. CIVIL SERVICE ESTIMATES. At half-past 4 o'clock the Clerk called the order of the dlay for " Supply," and Mr. WILSos immediately moved ;that the Speaker do leave the chair. This motion, which Was carried instantaneously, excited much laughter and took the House by surprise, it having been generally expected that some Ministerial statement would have been made on a subject which occupies so much of the public thoughts as the conclusion of peace. When the HIouse had been in committee for a few minutes Lord Palrnerston entered, and amid cheers and laugliter took his seat on the Treasury bench. The first vote was 195,1411. for Royal Palaces and public tnildings. BMr. WILLIAMS remarked with displeasure on the large increase in the expenditure on account of the parks and palaces, and thought the items for Hampton Palac particularly objectionable, inasmuch as that establishment wsas not a Royal residence, but was simnjly reserved as an asylum for poor and decayed members of the aristocracy. Since the accession of Her M1ajesty to the Throne more than 200,0001. -.had been expended upon the repais of BncLingham Palace, the purchase of lard, and the extension of the buildig. He -wouldbe the last ian to grudge any espenditure which -would promote Her Majesty'sconfoft, but he thought some explanation should be afforded with reference to the expenditure nowr proposed. Sir B. HALL replied to the inquiries of the lion. gentleman, bet in so indi,-inct a tone os to be almost inaudible in the gallery,. He was understood to say that, although an increase of expenditure f or the Roya] palaces was proposed in thcse estimates, tt would be found that, upon an average -of years, this branch of the pulxic expenditurehadbeen considerably reduced. Under the head of "Public Buildings *nd Royal Palaces," there was an increase of 40,1891. in the preSent estimates, asf compared with thos e of last year; but a very small proportion of this expunditure-about 3,0001. -was connected with Royal palacc. rartly in the personal occuation of Her Majesty. T'he l.argr portion of this vote was for public buildings and offic-,4 including the War De- prtment, 7,075t. r the Tower, 2,443!.; Chelea Ho.pita, 2,0 2D,; and the distribution of the Crimean medals by Her Alajesty in St. Jamess Park, 1,615!. About 18,0001. (as --we understood) of the amount of this vote waa for works which had notpreviously'beei,brought into the accounts of his department. He might observe that the appointment. to apartments in Hanpto Court Palace iested entirely with theQueen, and helwould inform the committee in what manner such appointments had been conferrtd during the -last year. -- 2"Ir. SPOONER here observed that the right hon. barouet spoke hi so low a tone that hon. gentlemen on the Opposition benches could not hear a word he said SiT' B. HAL., slightly raising his voice, proceaded to say that, on the 4th of May Mrs. Fox Strangeways, the *idow of General Strangeways, received the grart of apartments in Hampton Court Pa!,.ce. (Cheers.) On the 19th of June a similar appointmrnent wras given to Mrs. Cureton, on the 9th of July to Mrs. Boxer (cheers), subsequently to -Mrs. Shadforth, andon the 9th of Decemberto Lady Torrens. 'Cheers.) Mr. BLACKBURN thought no one could object to the bestowal of such appointments upon the ladies wvhose names lad been mentioned by the right hon. baronet. (Eear, hear.) Those appointments, howeve mr, did not explain the necessity of expending 5,Q0001. uLpon the repair of Hamnpton Coart Palace. He might observo that the increaso upon this *voto during the last to years had been 60,000!. He 'wished to know why so large an amount as 10,000t. Was required for Chelsea HIospital ? Sir B. HALL replied, that the alterations in connexion with Chelsea Hospital had beenin contemplation for seve"al years, and included the formation of footpaths and terraces, with the erection of flights of steps and iron railings. MLr. W. WILLIAMS was not satisfied with the explana tion given by the hon. baronet reJative to Hampton o Hie found that a sum of 5,28$!. was required for the stables and outbuildings connected with tbat palace. What advaniage, he wished to know, would the widows of distinguished oflicers derive from that expendituro? Again, a sum of 496l. was asked for a stud-house and other buildings anproIrisated to the stud establishment, and another of S73. for farm ildingsat Hampton. How could those items contribute to the comfort of the ladies whose names had beei mentioned to the committee? It would have been far betteto give the widows an annuity of 2001. each for the purpoe of providing themselves with apartments. The country would have saved nearly 10,000l. by that arrangement, and the ladies would not have been exposed to the insults which they might have to bear from the poor but haughty mem, bers of the aristocracy among whom they were placed at Hampton Court. (-Oh !oh P") M5r. ADDERLEY said, that last year a sum of 17,00. was voted for the formation of a carriage entrance from Buckingbam-gardens to Grosvenor-place. That entrance had since been opened, but he ventured to say that it did not cost abovo 4,0001. or 5,000l. He wished to know what had become of the balance ? Sir B. H ALL was understood to answer the question, but he spoke in so low a tone of voice that it was impossible to catch even the substance of his xeply. SirH.WILOUGHLBYcalledattentiontothecircumsnce that, last year, a sum of 19,000!. was paid out of the revenue of the Woods and Forests for improvements in the park at Windsor Castle, while in the present estimates there was an item of 1S,000!. for the same purposes charged upon the department of Public Works, He thought it was desirable that repairs and improvements upon the Royal paaces and parks should be paid out of one fund, and one onily, Sir B. HAIL said that, two or three years ago, the office of Public Works was separated from that of Woods and Forests. He knew nothing of the expenditure of the latter department at Windsor Castle, and held himself responsible only for the vote of 18,000!. included in the present estimates. *fMr. WISE said, that no satisfactory answer had been gvon to the important question, what became of the balance of sumis voted by Parliament for specific objects ? last year a vote of 3,0001. was taken for repa-ring the statue of Charles I. at Charing-cross. All the money was not spent, and he would like to ascertain how the surplus was disposed of. He begged also to call attention to that portion of the vote now before the committee which related to furniture for public departments. During the last six years the House had voted 156,000!. for that article alone. For the last two years the estimates for furniture had been 57,0001. Now, he was not one of those who complained of expenditure for the departments, but when he foeud that upwards of i,000. ha been expended in converting theAoffice occudied by the Copyhold Commission into a Wgar-office, and more than 3,000!. in furnishing another housefor the commission, he thought that some endeavour should be made to check lavish and unnecessary expenditure. He likefise complained of the seemingly extravagant item of 19,000!. for lamps, candies, and towvels for the public departments. jSir B. HALL stated that the difference betwveen the sum voted for the repair of the statue of Charles L, and the actual cost was not asked from the Treasury. With respect to furniture for the public departments, the committee would see that there was a decrease in the expenditure this year of 8,600!. M fr. W. WILLIAMS reminded the committee that upon a former occasion the Secretary of the Treasury stated that when a siim voted for a particular purpose was not required for that purpose it might be devoted to some other obiect different from that for which it was originally intended. He did not believe that a single sLxpence of thAe sum voted for the repair of the statue of Charles I. remained in the Elxchequer. 3r. WILSON had great pleasure in assuring his hon. friend that the money not expended on the statue was safe in the Treasury. It was true that he stated upon a former occasion that when a sum was voted for one purpose and not required it might be diverted by thel'reasury to another. But there; was a limit to that rule, for while money voted for a particular service-for example, the army or navy-might be applied to any branch of that service, it could not be diverted to any object out of the service. With respect to tho civil service estimates, every item stood by itself, and, therefore, money voted for one purpose could not be applied to another. The answer to the question relative to the entrance from Buckingham-gardens to Grosvenor-place was a veery simple one. A vote of the House in Committee of Supply was a mere estimate of what the expease might be, and it was the duty of the department, in carrying out the wishes of the House, to make arrangements with tradesmen for performing the work. That done, the departmet asked or an issue from the Treasury to the amount required, and the difference, if any, between that amount and the sum voted never left the Exchequer. Sir H. WVILLOUGHBY asked* how it was, then, that there were three instances in which such transferences as Ihe had alluded to had taken place-namely, of 3,015!. in the Buckingham Palace vote, 401. in the vote for the statue of Charles I., and 141. in the vote for the Indian Law Commission? Mr. WILSON was not aware that any such transferences had taken place, but he would inquire unto the matter, and -would give an anu-wer on a future day. Lord J. MLAINNERS directed attention to the removal of the Enclosure Commissioners from Pembroke-house to St. James's-square, in order to make 'way for the War Department, and contended that this was an nnnecessary and expensive transference of offices. Vere the Enclosure Commissioners to return to Pembroke-house? Sir B. BALL explained the circumstances under which the change of offices had taken place, but was not able at present to answer the question. Mr. H. BAILLIE inquired what the Government intended to do with Barlington-house ? Mfr. WILSON said, that at this moment it was occupied by the senate of the London University, but that a plan was under consideration with the view of affording accommodation in Burlington-house'to all the societies which at present had apartments in Somerset-house. Lord W. GRAHAA1 asked whether the red cloth which had been used at thc distribution of the Crimean medals had been supplied by any Government office or by contractors, and what had become of it? He hoped that it had not falen into the hands of any army contractors, because, if it had, he feared that it might be used for clothing either the army or militia. Sir B. HALL said, that it had been hired aud returned to the owner. Mr. WISE, with reference to a vote of 1,053!. for repairing Glasgow Cathedral, said, that he did not object to the grant of small sums for preserving interesting ruins such as Dunfermline Abbey or Elgin Cathedral, but he asked whether Parliament was to be called upon from tine to time to vote sums of money for the decoration and repair of Scotch cathedrals when English cathedrals were maintained from a different source, and never thought of applying for any grant of public money? Sir B. NALL said, that Glasgow Cathedral was the property of the Crown, and that there were no dean and chapter with funds at their disposal to preserve the cathedral. Mr. GLADSTONE said, that he had heard in that house for many successive years, a great deal of censure lavished upon deans and chapters in England for levying fees as a condition of entrance to their cathedrals, and he never recol- lected a Government that had not entirely coincided with the opinions so expressed and that had not strongly urged that the admission ought to be gratuitous. Happening, however, in the autumn of 1853 to be travelling in Scotland, he visited Glasgow Cathedral, and the first thing which was demanded of him there was 6d. for permission to enter. He had immediately written to his right hon. friend the late Sir W. Molesworth, and he had promised to look into the matter, and he hoped that the fee for aduLmssion had been abolished. Sir B. HALL could not, fromz memory, state that there was any fee for admission. Mr. GIADSTONE.-Oh! I can speak to that. (A laugh.) Sir B. HALL would himself shortly be going to Glasgow, and would then personally inquire into the matter. The vote, reduced by 5661., was then agreed to. On a vote of 7,8681. for the works in the south front of Buckingham Palaco, Mr. BLACKBURN said that, from a return which he held in his hand, it appeared that in March, 1855, there was a sum of 15,0001. in hand, and he wished to know what had become of that money ? Sir B. HALL s-id, that it was truo that in M3arch, 1855 there was a sum of 15,000!. in hand, but that was more than a year ago, and the money had since been expended upon the purpose for which it had been voted. The vote was agreed to. On a vote of 91,684!. for maintaining and keeping in repair the Royal parks and gardens, Sir R. WILLOUGHBY considered that the srmn proposed was excessive. The committee should be cautious in voting sulch large sums of money, and he certainly thought that they should require some explanation Of the necessity for so great an expenditure. The amount proposed to be spent in HIyde Park appeared to him not to bo essentially necessary, and he should move that the vote be reduced by 5,000!. Sir B. HIALL said that this veto liad been so framed that the comnittee could, by zeferring to the itews of it, at enuo ve'ry uceless. Indeed, he believed the country hsad nothin, like theire oney's worth for the high salary of the LordI^eubeant. Thevote was then agreed to; and, also, votes of 15,1641. for the salaries and expeuses of the offices: of the Chief Secretary of the Lord-Lieutenant in Dublin and in Loiidon; of 6,9l24. for the Paymaster of 'Civil Services office; and of 2,5W. for Lunatic Asylums in Ireland, UFon 5 vote of 22,57G1. for the salaries and expenses of the Board of WYorks in Ireland, Mr. WII.IAMS complained that the e:qpenses of drairage works and the general valuation of Ireland were charged to the publc instead of to the individuals who wouldl be benefitted, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, the general valuation of IreLnnd was originally ordered with reference to the county cess; and, with respect to the drain eg works, they were paid out of public grants, and were, therefore, executed under Governnnent superintendea. Mr. VILLIAMS contended that the county cess in Ire.' land was the same as the county rates in England, and that the e:ipenso of a valuation for that purpose ought to fall' exclusively on the landed proprietors of Ireland, and not on the public. Mr. hlACARTNEY said, although the Government advanced the money, the Irish counties had to pay for the valuation. Mr. BLACKBURN thought it very extraordinary that public works in Ireland shsould cost as much as public works in Eadland. The vote was agreed to. Upon a vote of l0,3011. for salaries and contingent expenses in the department of the commnissioners for auditing public accounts, Mr..SOWYER called?attentiontotheGovernment neglect of two important subjects. In 1831 the matter was referred to a ci)mmission of which Dr. Bowring .,was a member. Dr. Bawring reconmmended uniformiity in the method of keeping the public accounts, and the introduction of the system of double entry. Since 1847 there had been no return of the state of business in the Audit-office, but at that period the office was greatly in arrear. Dr. Bowring reported that in France and Belgium there were no arrears, the accounts being audited in those countries by what were *alled Chambers of Accounts. The accounts in our own Audit-office had been 'Iwo years in arrear, and the commissioners complained that they had no means of remedy-ing this state of things. The great evil was that the public accounts werer brought to the A udit-offiee in a particular form, and that the office had then to put them in the entirely altered form required by the Exchequer. If a uniform system of keeping the publicaccounts were adopted, they could be carried into the Board of A udit, and there audited without any alteration of form. The Commisioners of Audit had no power to compel any accountant to bring in his accounts for audit, They had no compulsory powers by which to expedite the process. All that they could do -was to represent the matter to the Treasury, who might order the Attorney-General to exchequertheaccountant. But in the system adoptedin France and Belgium this evil was obviated, for the Board of Audit had a contentions power. They could make orders upon puLblic accountants to bring in th-ir accounts, and, if they did not, they were armed with proper powers to compel them to bring their accounts before them. If the accounts being brought in did not satisfy the contentious branch of the court, it had the power of compelling the accountant duly to account before the board. He should like to keow whetheranything had been done to fulfil the promise made on this subject by the right hon, gentleman (Mr. Disraeli) when ho held office, and whether the Government were willing to consider the necessity of applying soeie remedy to the inconvenience? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, thatthe subject had already received his attention, and he had framed the outline of a measure for consolidating the acts relating to the audit of the public accounts, and he hoped to lay be. fore the House the details of the measure at an early oppor-tunity. Mr. MACARTNEY obsrvede that 36 clerks in the Auditoffice had been transferred to the War Department. Had -taxt transfer anything to do with the intention said to be entertained, that the War-office was to audit its own accounts? Mr. WILSON.-The War-office will audit its own accounts. Mr. MACARTN'EY.-That cannot be done without a -Treasury minute. M1r. WILSON.-There is a Treasury minute. Mr. MACARTIKEY should take an early opporttunity of moving that the Treasury minute be laid on the table. Mr. W. WILLAMS held it to be most objectionable to allow any department to audit its own accounts. (Hear.) He hoped that the House would never sanction such a system, and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would reconsider this subject. He complained that the salaries of -the Comaissioners of Audit, amounting to 6,3001. a-year, were not brought before that House, but were charged upon the Consolidated Fund. The CSANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER agreed with his hon. friend that departments ought not to audit their own accounts (hear, hear), but his hon. friend had overlooked the important fact, that the accounts audited by the War-office were accounts not of expenditure made by persons who conducted the audit, blut, for the most part, of expenditure incurred upon foreign stations and in colonies and places remote fromn the department. Thus the persons who conducted the audit were quite unconnected with those who made the disbursements. It was a mere question of convenience, and in the consolidation of military departments which had recently taken pilace it w;as thought that certain details of military expenditure ought to be audited, not by the Audit-office, hut by the central military department. He wiasprepared to lay upon the table the Treasury minute by w hich the transf'er was effected and in wrhich the nature of the change was explained. The salaries of the Commissioners of Audit were charged on the consolidated fund, instead of being includedin thevotes, upon the long-established constitutional principle that the Audit Board should be placed upon the same footing as the jud'fles. They occupied an inde.pendent judicial position, t!ey held their office not at the pleasure of the Crown but during good behaviour, and their salaries were excepted when the act was passed transferring a number of charges from the consolidated fund to the votes. Mr. HENLEY thought the right hon. gentleman had not given any reason for transferring the audit of the exuenditare of military departments from a properly constituted judicial tribunal to persons who might have caused that expenditure. Mr. W. WILLIAMS wished to knbw by what department the military expenditure was in future to be audited ? Lord PALMERSTON said, great misunderstanding seemed to prevail with regard to this matter. The expenditure of the army was the expenditure of the regimental officers; accounts of that expenditure were rendered by the paymasters, an d those were the accounts audited at the War-office. They amounted to a very large sum, but they _consisted of very minute items of expenditure, which had taken place in accordance with regultions made by the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary for War, and it was quite impossible that they could be audited by auditors who were not cogynizant of those regulations. They consisted of items relating to each, separate soldier in the service according to his position, from time to time, in quarters, in the -field, or inbarracks, and they were not therefore accounts of the War Department. MIr. HENLEYsaked how these accounts had been hitherto audited if it was impossible that they could be au&ited by the Audit-office ? Lord PAJ2AEBllTO1 said, his meaning was that the great hulk of expendture being regimental qxpenditure, it could only be audited by the War Department, as it always had been audited from the earliest time by persons acting nder the Secretary-at-A-ar. Mr. HENLEY said, tho committee wished to ascertain the exact items of expenditure which had been withdraw;n Wrom te cogiae of the lComissioners of Auditi? IMfr. NVIISON said, he would endeavour to explain the -matter as far as lie understood it. In regard to the commnissariat accounts, it had been the practice for the commissariat officeis abroad to send their accounts to the Audit Board without communicating with any department at home; but when the commiissariat department was separated from the Treasury and removed to the War department, it was thought more proper that the latter should receive the whole of these minute accounts from their own officers and audit them in the first instance, but, finally, they would be audited by the Audit Board. Mr. HENL-EY thought the committee should be perfectly satisried on the point whether these accounts were to go to the Audit Board at all, for it seemed extraordinary that, at a tine when more than ever a strict and proper audit was needed, about one-fourth of the staff of the Audit board was transferred to another department. (Hear, hear.) It wag impossible, under these circumstances, but that the public should entertain the idea that something was going - to boe hushed up. He hoped the HIowe would be furnished with more information on the matter than it possessed at present, and the best plan now to adopt would be to post-pone the vote. The CHANCELLOIR of the EXCHEQUER assured the -committee that the change had been made to render the audit not less complete but more efficient; and it was in sitbt spir and belief that the alteration had been effected with the full concurrence of the Audit Board and the War Department. He was not sifficiently acquainted with the -details of military expenditure to be able fully to explain -the matter perhaps, but it had been minutely investigated by-pegns competent to forma judgment on the subject, had he repeated that this transference from the Audit Board had teen made, not with the view of hushing up or hiding anything, but to make the audit as efficient as possible. As this subject was connected with the vote for the War Department, he hardly thonght that there would be any advantage now in postponing the present vote. Mr. DISRAELI was sorry to press the Government to postpone the vote, but when tfie Chancellor of the Ex-- chequer confessed that he could not explain it there existed a1prm4facieground for asking for its postponement. He onoe bshd occasion to consider this question of audit, and his inipresionA -was that the greatest fault in our administration 'was the limited system of audit, and if any chau"e took place it should be to increase the powerandindependonce of -the system of audit. (Hear.) In the course of the present dicussio4 iA appeared to be acknowledged that the audit was incomplete - and the change now proposed, instead of increasing the towers of the audit, oiiud dimish them, while at the same time the expenditure of the country was 7 n re55;,g:-TheTChancellor of the Exchequer, admitting that he knew niothing about the question, saild that, in the opinion of pWons of the highest auathority, the arrange. ment was advantageous to the public service; but he (Mr, -Disraeli) remembered a public servant of great reputation and experience ssting that he did not care if the commissariat weretransferred to the War Deparment, but he hoped that care would he taken that the audit should not also ba transferred. The audit in this country, which ouglt to be opletesad independent, bad alwaysbeenunequal to the of a German princo. The duty of tlqeMiuse_of Cemioiiir was to tnscertain: that the pubic money was- applied to suitable objects, seid to tako care that those objects werer carried out as efficiently as possible. He thoughut this vote ought to receive the sanction of the commnittee, because its object was to afford infonmation which not only !guided their-decisions as legislators, but which might materially influence the prosperity of the country. Xr. WALPOLE hoped hEis sight hon. friend did not sup!pose that he, or any one wrho advocated a proper control over tU:e expenditure incurred in printing, wishedb to deprive the House or the country of any information which it was uecessary they should posess, All that he (Mr. - Walpole) desired was, that some person should be made responsible for the -uass of matter which was constantly printed, and which was as constantly read. (A bugh.) i ,a,ny bon, IlqWbEr w24=s, 4 2hi'y9 e'd I.II ,M- ra;;,3U 01f hi~ meaning he could give one. It .as stated by Mr. MICulloch that in theappendix to the second volumne of the Wine Dutles report there w,ere tables occupyig 234 pages, describing the vattings of wine in different docks; and Mr. I'Culloch o.b served, " Thereis not, I behieve, *sane person in the empire bho ever read a line of it, or ever will." (Laughter.) No less than 1,750 copies of this report were, however, printed and circulated at the public exponse. Mr. DISRAELI reminded his right hoa. friend that the chairman of the committee had. practically the power of preventing an appendix of unreasonable hulk from being printed. So document could be printed without the sanction of the Printing committe, and they were bound to assume that the committee would not permit the publication of papers which they did not think necessary for the information of the House aud of the country. Reference had been made to the publication of documents by the Poor law Board, but the printing of such documents might at any time be checked by the Treasury. He thought, jtherefore, that sufficient means existed for preventing the abuse of a privilege which he regarded a5 of great publc importance. Mr. WILSON stated, in ieply to Mr. PELLTTr, that the specifications of patents were printed and sold to the public at a very low price, under the provisions of an act of Parliament passed within the last three years. Mr. HADFIELD expressed his hope that copies of these specifications would bo furnished to mechanics institutes and public institutions in all the manufacturing towns of the country. The yoat was then agreed to. The foUlowing votes were then agreed to 140,410?. for postage of public departments. 36,0411. lOs. for Law charges in England. 250,000?. for prosecutions at a.sizes and quarter sessions. 1,100L. for Crown-office, Chancery. 2,0501. for Crown-office, Queen's Bench. 16,340?. for sheriffs' expenses and office of Queen's Remembrancer ofthe Court of Exchequer.

And 1,832?. for the Four Courts, Marshalsea (Dablin). TICKETS OF LEAVE. On the motion that the Chairman report progress, Mr. WALPOLE said, he presumed the next vote, which was for prison and convict services at home and abroad, would be taken npon Friday. As that subject was one of vast importance, and as he believed that a very exaggerated idea existed out of doors with respect to the effects of the ticketof-leave system, he suggested that it would be desirable that the Government should afford some informa. tion relative to theo worldng of that system, and should explain whether thev proposed to take any precautionary, measures in order to prevent any ill results following upon! the emancipation of a large number of convicts. Sir G. GREY agreed with the right hon. gentleman that exaggerated notions did prevail throughout the country with regard to the evils of the ticket-of-leave system. He believed that an inouiry into the matter was desirable, but as he thought that the motion which had been given notice of by the hon. member for Berwick3hire was too vague in its application hehadplaced upon the table an amendment, which would limit the inquiry to the act of 1853, which abolished transportation.j The CHAIRMAN then reported progress, and obtained leave to sit again. VACCINATION BILL. Mr. COWPER, in moving the second readin- of this bill said that it was intended to consolidate and amend the existing law upon the subiect of vaccination, which was contained in three acts of Parliament, the first passed in 180, and the last in 1853. By the law as it now stood gretuitous vaccination was provided for every one who chose to avail himself of it, and parents were compelled under a penalty to have their childrer' vaccinated. 'There were, however, defects in the details of the law which it was necessary to amend. It was a fact established beyond dispute by medical testimony that vaceina- j tion propcerly performed was almost a certain spcecificX against smallpox, and statistics proved that in pro- I portion to its adoption that disease had very sensibly'l diminished. Such had been the case in this country, but it~ had been so to a much greater extent on the continent. In England. in the year 1852, the number of births wa 3 601,839, and the number of children under one year of ags vaccinated was 200,36; in 1853, the number of birt:3 being about the same, the number of vaccinations wa; j 201,271; in 1854 the number of births was 623,699, and the number of vaccinations 408,824; in 1855 the births were 623,181, and the number of vaccinations 354,979, showing aI decrease which led him to the conclusion that the existin, law required amendment. What was the state of affairsi foreign countries? Before vaccination was introduced in Austria the average mortality from smaUpox was 67 to 1.000, -while afterwards it fell to 6; in the district of Trieste it was 141-it fell to 5; in Bohemia, from 58 it fell to 2; in the Rhenish provinces, from 32 to 4; in Sweden, from 71 to 2. It appeared, therefore, to him that something should be done to render the system of vaccination in this country more complete than it at present was; for, although to a certain extent the existing act had produced a good result, for in 1838 the mortality in England from smallpox was 16,268, while after tho passing of the act it fell to 6,368, and at present was about 5,000, the benefit would be largely increased by improved machinery. One defect of the present law was the system of registration, and he proposed by the present bill to introduce au improved method. He proposed also to give the board of guardians the power of defraymg the expenses of prosecutions, and, at the same time, to transfer from the board of guardians to the General Board of Health the power of laying down such rules as they maight think fit regarding the qualifica- tion of the medical men employed. The present minimum j rate of remuneration appeared to him to be fixed too low, and he proposed to raise it from ls. 6d. to half-a-crown. Objections had been raised to making vaccination com- pulsory, but by the present law it was compulsory, and' for his part he could not understand that a parent should be allowed to have the power not only of risking the life of his child by neglecting to apply to it'-uhat was almost a suire specific against smallpox, but also of risking the health and lives of that part of the community in his immediate neighbourhood. X He thought it quite an abuse of the "voluntary principle" so apply it in cases of this sort, and to allow a man what was neithermore nor less than the freedom to spread disease. In every country it was held that smallpox ought tobe guarded against, and he did not see why this country alone should ileave such a disease to extend its ravages far and wide with- out an attempt to check them. As the principle of the measuro now before the House did not go beyond the existing law, the object being merely to amend and improve that vhich had already received the assent of Parliament, he trusted the House would pass the bill, subject to such alterations in its details as mught be thought expedient in committee. He now, therefore, begged to move that the bil be read a second time. Mr. HENLEY said, it was true that the principle of this measure had already been assented to by Parliament, but some of the details were very objectionable. Two confficting authorities would be set sp-the Poor Law Board and the Board of Health. Now, that would be a most inconvenient arrangement, and, therefore, in committee he should strike out all which related to the Board of Health, and leave the question-as it ought to be-in tho hands of the boards of guardians and the Poor Law Board. There-had certainly been a good; deal of dissatisfaction throughout the country as to the mode in which vaccination had been performed. In his own neighbourbood, for example, the poor people com-. plained that all sorts of eruptionis had made their appearanceupon their children after the forced vaccination they had had to undergo; and though this might have nothing to do with the vaccination the poor could not be sopersuaded. Such being the case, he was glad to sce a provision for increasing the fees to be paid to the vaccinator for, as work badly paid was genera lly-done, the smaU remuneration given to medical meni was probably one great reason why the operation was so much complained of. The present system of compelling mothers to leave their homes and take their children to the vaccinator was a very inconvenient one, and some consideration should, lhe thought, be given to this point in committee. Then, again, the provision by which the Board of' Health was to eertify who were competent to fill the office of vaccinators was very objectionable, and he hoped the right hon gentleman would withdraw it. Dr. MICHELL said that,. had not vaccination been introduced, smallpox would scarcely be heard of at the I prosent day. (A laugh.) Vaccination for the last few years we the object of it - and if the hon. bronet found any it¢on objectionable he aiould be glad if he would point it out. During the period in which he had had the honour to hold the omoe which he then held he had miado certain improvemnilts in Hyde Park which he beloved had given general satiifactiQn. Those improvements, however, had necearily entailed conderable expense. Thus the expenditure upon Rotten-row was 2,5001.,which sum bad been laid out upon the wideninganc remaking of the Rowand forthe.necessary fencing; and he did not think any gentleman who was in the habit of going into Hyde Park would very mnuch object tothis. Then, again, the pavement of the footpath in Birdcage-walk, had cost 1,600!., and * now pavement from Apeley-house down to Kiightabridge, 5751. The agregate amount of the vote mlight be large, but he did not think any item could be pointed out which ws really objectionable, Mr. BONHAM-CARTER called attention to tha following passage in Sir W. J. Hooker's report upon Kewgardens "I wish I could say that, what were once the pride of these gardens-I mean, the numerous conifers, and the trees and shrubs from Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, Temperate Mexico, &c., which demand space (especally height) and greenhouse protection, wero better provided for. Many of them are sufferin, beyond recovery for want of suitable winter shelter. ihe great need for other buildings to acoommodate our increasing palms and other field plants of tropical countries has been the cause of deferring the erection of a greenhouse adapted for conifers, but I cannot on the present occasion urge too strongly on you as First Commissioner (what, indeed, you must yourself see) the imperative necessity for such a structure, if the remnant of these splendid specimtens is te be saved," HIe trusted the right hon. gentlemanwould take some means te Prevent the destruction of these specimens, in accordance with the suggestion of Sir William ifooker. Sir B, HTALL replied that the constraction of this greenhouse had been pressed strongly upon hin, but he haa felt tbat, owing to the large expenditure under the vote now being discussed, the money could not bo asked for before next year. 31r. J. L. DAVIES complained of the large expenditure included in the vote. MIr. BLACKBURN said it was very well to keep the London parks in good order, but it was not fair to the, rest of the country that there should be such a lavish expenditure upon them. There was an increase of 22,1401. as compared with the expenditure under this head last year, and he certainly felt inclined to move that the vote be reduced by this amoiut. (Hear, hear.) Lord J. MANNERS thought it should be remembered that a great many of the improvements in the parks were pressea uponthe Chief Commissioner by members of thiat House, and by other persons who had a sort of persomnl interest in the matter. Mr. BOWYER said, the pavement of the path from Apsley-house to Knightsbridge night be an improvement, but nooneconldsay it was necessary. This was a period of time at which Government should avoid every expense that wvas not absolutely necessary. Mr. SPOONER said, that the remarks of hisnoble friend Lord J. Manners) made it absolutely necessary that the 5ouse should impose some restriction on the expenditure on account of these Royal parks and pleasure gardens, for his noble friend had said that the pressure from without was so great that it was almost impossible for the Government to resist it. It was fitting, therefore, that the House should interpose and put an end to this external pressure. Let those who more particularly enjoyed the advantages of the parks payforthe expense ofthe alterationsrequired fortheir convenience. By the system now pursued they were taxing the whole community for the benefit of a few. He wished to ask whether the paving of the footpath from Hyde Parkcorner towards Knightsbridge meant the footpath within tho park or outside of the park? If outside of the park, it ought to have been paved by the parish. Sir B. HALL said, that a portion of the pathway belonged to the Government, and that the parishioners had called upon him to pave it, they being ready t6 repair that part of it which was within the parish. Mr. BOWYER said he should move that this vote be reduced by the sum of 22,1401., being the amount of the increase of the vote this year as compared with the vote for 1855: Mr. SPOONER observed a charge of 1,454!. for filling up the basin in the Green Park, opposite Devonshire-house, and improving the adjacent ground. This appesred to have been done by an order of the Treasury, vithout th* sanction of Parliament. Sir B. HALL said, by the act of 1852 it was enacted that there should be no reservoir within a certain distance of Buckin-ham Palace, it was therefore necessary that soniething siould be done vith respect to the reservoir in tho Green Park. On his coming into office he made arrange. ments with the Chelsea Water Company to obtain posses. sion of the basin on the part of the Crown. Complaints having been made of the existence of that reservoir, and a strong desire expressed that it should be filled up, he obtained the assent of the Lords of the Treasury to incur the necessary expense forthatpurpose. The basin had been emptied, and it was intended to restore the locality to the state in which was in the year 1726,when the Chelsea Water Company first obtained possession of it. Mr. BtRROW said, wvith reference to the paving of the footpath from Hyde Park-corner to Knightsbridge, he did not think it a good reason whythe countrv should be put to that expense merely because the inhabitants of Knghtsbrndge preferred walking on a 'dag pavement rather than on a gravel wvalk. He did not object to niprovements which were for the benefit of the whole of the metropolis, but ho could not understand upon what principle it was that the public should be charged for works intendedonlyfortho advantage of a particular locality. Sir B. HALL.-Does the hon. member wish the inhabitants of Knightsbridge to take legal proceedings to compel the Government to do that which they are bound to do I Mr. BARROW.-I should like to ask the right hon. baronet by what process of law the inhabitants of Knightsbridge could compel him to lay down a flag pavement where no flag pavement had previously existed? (Hear, hear.) 3fr. W. WILLIAMS agreed with the hon. member for North Warwickshire, that the pressure upon the right hon, baronet was almost irresistible, and, unless the Government were backed up by the House of Commons, there would be no end to these extravagant estimates. They were called upon to vote large sums without any explanation whatever. He wished particularly to ask why the cost of Windsor Park was not included in these estimates ? For instance, the public were called upon to provide winter quarters for the deer, food for the birds, and powder and shot for the keepers, and even for fishing taclde. These were items which demanded inspection. Mr. L. DAVIES asked, whether the Governxnent was legally bound to repair the footpath from Hyde Park-corner to Knightsbridge ? Sir B. HA L said, no one could be called upon to repair it except the Government. It was not under the control of the 3Metropolitan Roads Commission, but was under the control of the Office of Works. Sir J. PAKINGTON\ objected to a charge of 1,6001. for paving the footpath of Birdca-e-walk. At present the footpath was part pavement ana part gravel. The public seemed to prefer the gravel, and he should, therefore, vote against that item, as well as against th.e item for the pavement at Hyde Park-corner. With respect to the improvemen ts in Hyde Park, he thought that the proposals of the right lion, barornet were in accordance wfith good taste and good judgment, and that from no expenditure would the public derive more enjoyment. (Hear, hear.) Mr. DRUMIO?ND said, the right hon. baronet (Sir B. Hall) had a great hole opposite Devonshire-house. All he had to do was to write up " Rubbish may be shot here." Instead of which he proposed to expend 1,400!. in filling it up. (A laugh.) Sir J. SHELLY was in favour of flag pavement as the most eoonomical. The committee divided on the amendment of Mr. Bowyer, and the numbers were:- For the amendment ... ... ... 35 Against ... ... 119 majority against the amendment -84 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TREATY OF PEACE. On the question that the vote be agreed to, Mr. F. FRENCH said, it was without precedent that the war should be concluded without Her Majesty'sMinisters condescending to inforni the House of the fact. It was true that the noble lord at the head of the Government had entered the house after the House had gone into Committee of Supply, but if the noble lord did not think it worth his while to make the announcement of the treaty of peace after the House had gone into Committee of Supply, it would only have been decent and respectful to the House if his colleagues had waited a few minutes until the noble lord arrived. In order to give the noble lord an opportunity of declaring what had taken place, he would move that the chairman report progress. He might be told that the signing of the treaty of peace had been announced by firing the guns, but the House would re. member that the same guns had fired for Sebastopol when it had not been taken. (A laugh.) A communication was made to the House when the war was commenced, and the Government were, he thought, bound to make a similar communication to the House if peaco were concluded. (Hear, hear.) Lord PALM E RSTON. -Sir, I was in the house not three minutes after the half-hour, which is. usually the time for notices of motion being given and questions being put. There were notices of motionprevious to going into Committee of Supply, andthere were also notices of questions, and I was as much surprised as other members could be to find the House in Committee of Supply at so unusually early an hour. (Hear.) If I had come down to the house three minutes sooner I should have made a statement which I am quite prepared now to make. (Hear.) It is a very short one, and will convey no information to the hon. member beyond that which he already possesses. (A laugh.) If it be any satisfaction, however, to my hon. friend to be informed officially of that which he already knows individually, I shall have very great pleasure in enlightening his nmind. (A laugh.) The House is perfectly aware fromn the Gazdte that yesterday, at 2 o'clock, a treaty of peace was signed at Paria. (Cheers.) The House will have seen by the ainoiucement in the Gazette that it was determined by the Congress that the particular conditions of the treaty should not be made public until the ratifications had beenexchanged. And that. indeed, is the usual course, 1,r it is a mark of obvious deference to the Powers who arm parties to the- treaty. At the same time, without goiP4 into any details of the conditikms, the main substancq, of which is already 1nUowm to s11 the b->vi becausei it has been om- bodied iA protocols and published kn every country inE urop I may may at loast that my eonviction iE, that that treaty of peace wi be detmed satisfactory by this country and by Europe. (Cheers.) Sir, it Will be found that the objects for which tho iar wax aundertAkes have been fully acconopli-hod. It will be found that by the stipulationa of that treaty the integrity and in. dependence of the Turkish ompiro wil he-secured,-as fras human arrangementscn effect that purpose. (Cheers.) It will be found that that treaty is honourable to all the Powers vxo ara contracting parties to it, and I trust thxt, while, on the one hand, it has put an end to a war- which every friend to humanity must naturally havo wishod to see concluded, on the other hand it will lay the-foundation of a peace -which I trust, so far at last as regards the circumstances out of which the War beganwill be lasting andenduring (Hear, hear.) Sir, during .the negotiations which have led to this pe*ce I am happy to say that the sa-me cordiality which has prevailed among the allies in carrying on the war has also mainly contributed to tho conclusion of peace, and that we shall leave off at the conclusion of this war in a stricter and closer alliancoe with them-and in a more extended alliance-than- existed during the continuance of the war; and, that therefore, tho future permanence not only of a good understanding but of an intimate connexion botwaen the great Powers of Europe will have been cemented and strengthened by the c6mnunications that have taken place "during the negotiations. (Hear, hear.) Sir, I have nothing more to say, except that it must be gratifying to the country to know that nothing could exceed the ability with which the British negotiators havo performed their arduous and difficult task duringtho negotiations (cheers), and that Lord Clarendon andc Lord Cowley have not only maintained the honour, dignity, and interests of the] country they represented, but by their conciliatory conduct have secured for themselves and their country the respect, esteem, and goodwill of those with whom they had to do. (Cheers.) The ratidcations are to be exchanged as soon as theyrn be received at Constantinople andUti. Petersburg. The limitation of time has been four weeks, but I should hope that at leasd within three weeks the ratifications will be exchanged at Paris. (Cheers.) The amendment was then withdravwn. Colonel DUNNE objected to the public money being altogetherwithdrawn from Ireland and spent in embellishing the metropolis. He should divide the committeoagainsttho vote. Tohe committee again divided, when the numbers thre- Forthe amendment ... ... ... 28 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 97 M1ajority against the amendment ... 69 hir. BOWYERb moved another amendment, to reduce the vote by 2,1751., the sum required for paving the footpath in Birdcage-walk and the footpath between Hyde Park. corner and Knightsbridge. Mr. Mx CHAMBERS had observed with great satisfac. tionthe numerous improvements which had taken place in the parks, but many of those improvements could not be enjoyed by the multitude, and he hoped that the committee would not refuse to sanction this vote, as it was intended for the benefit of the multitude, Ho wished, however, to know why the Crowrn, instead of the parish, was called upon to keep in repair the pavement between HydeParkcoruer and Knightsbridge, and, also whether the existing pavement in Birdoage-walk was to be widened, or a new one was to be made?m Sir B. HALTT said that Lord Carlisle had put down the small pavement nowf existing betweoen Great George-street and Buckingham -gate, and it was now. roposed to widen that pavement. '$he pavement betwreen Efyde Park-corner and Knightsbridge had -alwrays been tnder the control of the Government, and they were caLled upon year by year to repair it. Mr. BARROW thought that the right hon. baronet had .ot given a satisfactory explanation of the liability of the Crown to repair the footpath to Knightsbridge. He denied that the widening of the gravel waLks and the erection of iron railings in the parks would be an accommodation to the million. T$hey would prefer -walk ing on grass to walking on gravel Mr. BIGGS said that he, for one, had the same feeling with respect to the metropolis of Great Britain as a Frenchman had with respect to Paris, and should like to see it made the finest looking city in the world. He therefore had no objection to spend money for its adornment, and especially for such improvements as would be subsidiary to the health of the inhabitants. The committee divided, when the numbers were,- For the amendment ... ... ... ... 19 Aguinstit ... ... ... ... ... S3 Majority ... .... ... ... -C4 Mr. BLACKBURN then proposed to reduce the vote by the sum of 2,570!., which was required for making a new road threugh Holyrood Park to D)uddingstone. It might seem strange for him to object to a vote of money for Scotland; but though he did not think the whole sum assigned to Scotland too much, yet he thought the proposed road not wanted at all, and he wvas fearful it might spoil a portion of the park. At all events, if the Government insisted on spending this sium on a new road, a plan of the road ought, in the first instance, to be laid before the House. Sii R. BIKELEY said that, as they were voting large sums for beautifying the metropolis and altering the parks for the convenience of the public, ho should like to-know what objection there could be to the pulling down of St. James's Palace? (Hear, hear.) The question of affording to the public a convenient carriage-road to Belgravia had engrossed a great deal of the time of the right hon. baronet (Sir B. all), and had ocasioned much public discussion, and the pulling down of St. James's Palace would be the means of providing the desired thoroughfare, would enable a beautiful approach to the park to be made from St. anies's-strees, and w. ould leave at the rivat hon. baronet's disposal a vast apace for the erection of public buildings more in accordance with present style and taste. Eistorically there waS nothing of interest in the palace, and as a building it wvas most hideous. (Htear.)C Mr. H. BAILLIE said, he believed this vote was a complete job, the object of which was to improve certain private property which at present did not possess any outlet. He was informed that the peoDle of Edinburgh did not -wish this road to be made, and that it could- only be made by blasting through a portion of Arthur's Seat. Sir B. HALL said that, from what he could learn from the communications whichhe had hadwith the Lord Provost of Edinburgh on the subiect, there was a strong feeling in Edinburgh in favour of the making of this road, and he belioved it would be a great improvement to the city. Mfr. E. LOCKHART understood that this road was merely a job to imProve certain property which la'y beyond Arthur's Seat, and, unless the right hon. baronet could assure him to the contrary, he should certainly oppose the vote. Sir B. HALL was not aware of anything which could give this vote the complexion of a job. He believed it to be a perfectly bon& fide improvement, 'specially desired by the authorities and inhabitants of Edinbuh. Mr. VANSITTART said, if that were so, it was strange that no Scotch member had spoken in favour of the-vote. Sir IV. JOLIFJFE thought the Board of Works ought not to have undertaken to propose this vote to the House without having sent a Gover-nment official to report on the project. Sir B. HA Ll said, that had already been done. The pro. position, when first made by the Lord Provost, and townicouncil, was referred to the office of the Board of Works ini Scotland, and his report to the department on the subject might be seen by any one who desired it. Mr. STIRLING wished to know in what proportions the road was to be made ? Sir B. HAT AT said that the arrangement was, that thle road would be made, so far as the property of the Crown was concerned, with the money now asked for, but that no expenditure would be commenced by the Board of Works until they saw that snfficient money was provided by the persons interested to complete the remainder of tae road outside the Crown property. Mr. BARROW thought it would be time enough to asik for this vote when there was some certainty that the remainder requisite to complete the project would be forthcoming. After some further conversation, Mr. DISRAELI pointed out the inconvenience of discussing this item in the absence of the members for Edinburgh, who could answer for the feeling of that city on the subject and explain the facts of the case. Sir B. HALL said, ho would postpone the item, and The voto was then agreed to minus the sum of 2,570!. for the making of the road in question. On the vote of 99,3831. for works and expenses connected with the new Houses of Parliament, Mx. SPOONER inquired why one of the courtyards had been already repaved? Sir B. HALL said that this court was originaly paved, as an experiment, with some preparation of indiarubber. The experiment had not been successful, and for the indiarubber a wooden pavement had therefore been substitutedL It was not at the suggestion of Sir C. Barry that this experiment was tried. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY wished to be informed what sum would suffice for the completion of the Houses of Parliament, and what was the present position of the question as to the commission to be paid to the arclhitect ? Sir B. HALL said that, in a report dated tho 9th of Janr- ary, 1855, and laid on the table of the house by his predecessor in office, Sir . Molesworth, it was stated that a sumof 280,270.would berequiredfor the purpose of completing the houses. Since then a sum of moneyhad been taken on account of this amount, and it was now proposed to take a I further sum of 52,1540. Upon inquiring of SirC.Barry,he I had been informed that the sum set down in the report of the 9th of January, 1855, would be sufficient for the completion of the works. MIr. Ho BAIILIE asked whether this estimate was confined to the cost of the works now iLn progress, or whether it would also cover the expense of catrying buttheadditional plans laid upon tbe table by Sir W. Molesworth, which included the removal of the courts of law ? As a site for the now- courts, he recommended to the consideration of the rght hon. baronet (Sir B. Hall) the ground occupied by Covent-gaTde Theatre. (A laagh.) Sir B. HALL replied that the sum of 280,2721. was onlyr for the conipletion of the works now in progrees. Sir W. Molesworth had laid upon the table some further plns. which had been suggested to him by Sir C. Barry; hixt he (SirB. Ball) would not sauction, or recommend the Government to sanction, any new plans until those which wero in hand had been carried out. THear, hear.) The sum required for tho execution of the works proposed in tie additional plans would be froni WC00.00. to 800,0001, Mr. W1, WITAJAIS called attentio to the iWin of 5,269h. "for casul internal re"par to those parts of the building delivered oyer to the Department of Work, and Buildings, and-for the repair oicial housesand xaniao4 .JCou.Y charges." Consi,dering w rae,entl, these b'uild. iogs hi en ereced ths amount ws ery lae. When thewhole palace w completed the eost 'f repairs Wouldbe prod,~gious. Surely the- necessity foril these ropairs must arise from some defect' of construction- ----- Jr. F. WII:ON, in reply to the question of Sir H. Willoughby as to the architect's commnen, tated 'that when it was estimaxted that -the whole -cost Do erecting the Houses of Farliamentwouldbe about 700,00W., Lord 'Beeborough, then First Commissioner of Work4, made-'a arrangement with Sir C. Barxy to perform all the duties of the architezt for a smm of 25,0D01. In th5 tonrae of time it becara apparent that, instead of 700,00DW., the houses would cost about three times that rm. Sir a. Barry meawhile received payments on account. -When the Treasury came to settle the rate at- which he waato be' paid, they looked to the principle on which Lord 33esborouh had originally lixedhis remuneration, and, seeing that the sum greed to be paid to the architect was at the rate of about 3 per oent. on the outlay, they offered to re Sir C. Barry at that rate upon the whole cost of the budings. That offer Sir C. Barry had refused, and still refused to accept. There w also a question as tothe measurement of theworL. Sir C. Birry had, Par with the officers of the Board of Works, performed a great portion of the measurement in atmanner vey unsatisfctor to the Board of Works and tothe Tsury. Binding that a professional measurer would not have chd more than three-quarters per cent. on the outlay forthe performance of this daty, he (Mr. Wilson) proposed to Sir C. Barry to pay him, inconsideration of is personal trouble, atth Tate of I per cent, Up to the close ofm the year 1852 there had been paid to Sir C Bary a sum of 44,000!., to which there must be added 15.000W. for merement, malsnP a total of 59,000W. There had been a great deal of negotiaton and discussion uthn is subject between Sir C. Barry and the Treasury. &Es noble friend at the head of the Government (Lord Palmerston) had given his attention to the claims of Sir C. Barry, and was satisfied that the proposal which had bear made by the Tre was a reasonable and indeed liberal one; and under these circumstances th Lords of the Treasury had come to the decision, embodied in a minute which had been laid upon the table of the House, that no further sums on accountshouldbe pad to Sir C. Barry until he accepted this as a definite araneenient. Whether or not he would so aecept it he (Mr Wilson) of course could not say. Mr. LLOYD DAVIES wished to be informed how mnuch of the stum of 280,272l., referred to in the report of the 9th of January, 1855, remained to be voted? Sir B. EALL said that he believed this sum included 107,1751. which had been voted before the report was preseated. Itivasnowproposedtotake52,540!. The sum remainng unvoted would be the difference between the total of these two items and the sum of 280,2727. Mr. D)RUMMOND denounced the conduct of the Government in their dealings with Sir C. Barry as scandalous and unprincipled, and observed, that everyone who had ever employed an architect or even known a person who had done so (a laugh), was aware that it was the custom of architects to charge 5 per cent.- on the money expended. If the Secretary of the Treasury was not cognizant of that fact, allthat coild be said was thatin matters relating to the erection of edifices he was the most profoundly ignorant man in England.- (Larughter.) The Government, enraged to find that 700,0001. would not cover one-third of the cost of the new palace, hit upon the singular expedient of cheat. ing Sir C. Barry (laughter)yes, of cheating him, of practising a positive fraud upon hum. (Laughter.) There bad beon a lavish and profligate expenditure from first to last, but they would not mend matters by actinrg dishonestly towardstheir architect. (Hear, hear.) Mr, WILSON denied that the Goverment had ever entertained any such intention. They desired to act most fairly by Sir C. Barry, and had proposed to allow him exactly the same commission, in proportion tothe increased expenditure that Lord Besboro agreed to pay him on the smaller amount. (Hear, hear.) It was;a mistake to suppose that per cent ontheoutlay was thealrate of remuneration to architects for national edifices. The architects of all the great pubEi buildings erected during the last half-century had been paid at the rate of 3 per cent. (Hear, hear.) Ir. WILLIAMS thought that the proposition made to Sir C. Barry was a most generous one, and that that gentle. man would do weUl to close with it at once. Ir. SPOONER was of the same opinion. The offer made by the Treasury was large and liberal, and it -was to be hoped that they would stand manfully by it. Iffr. MALINS suggested that the question should be referred to arbitration-a mode of settlement at once expeditious and inexpensive, and one which Sir C. Barry was qulte willing to accept. (Hea r.) It wasthus that a dispate between the samearcitect and the committee of the Reform Club was decided before Judge (then Mr.) Erle in a single sitting. Mr. DRUMMOND observed that it was the universal la-w of the Society of Architects that maembers of their body should receive remuneration at the rate of 5 per cent. on the outlay. He thought Sir C. Barry was fully entitled to a commson of 5 per cent., and that it was most unjust to endeavour to filch from him such fair remuneration for his labour. MEr. WILLTArS said that, in the case of the Reform Club, Sir C. Barry, along with a great number of other architects, sent in plans. The plan of Sir C. Barry was accepted, and it was arranged that he should receive a certai sum for carrying the plan into execution. Sir C. Barry, however, suggested certain alterations in his -plan, which were to a certain extent adopted, andthe contract being thus brok-en Sir Charles claimed to be remunerated by commission. The Reform Club proposed to refer the matter to arbitration on cortain conditions, to which Sir Charles Barry refused his assent, andcur ed thatitshould be referred to a barrister named by himnself. This course %as ultimately adopted, and so the affair was settled. 3Mr. LLOYD DAVIES observed that the case of the Reform Club could not, in his opinion; be put in comya%on with that of the Houses of Parliament. fVhat Would be a fair remuneration, at the rate of a per cent., upon anexpenditure of 80,000L, would be an extravagant charge upon an expenditureof2,000,000!. or 3,000,000!. hne commiission upon the expenditure incurred for the Houses of Parliannent, at the rate of 5 per cent., would, he believed, amonowt to about 1u0,0900. He hoped the Government would not rGeffertthis question, but would stad upon the high ground Mr. WILSON was ready to admit that Sir C. Barry had repeatedly urged the Government to refer the dispute to arbitration, but he (Mr. Wilson) thought that, if it would be objectionable for the executive Government to submit themselves to a trial at law, it vrould be still more objection. able to submit themselves to the decision of a professional man. (Hear, hear.) The Government felt that the pro- they bad made to Sir C. Barry vwas fair, and even lberal. i'hey kinewv that i they attempted to act unfairly that House would not tolerate such condnct and it ws the tribunal to which Sir Charles could legitimately and'hafely appeal. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MALINS would put it to hon. gentlemen whether an appeal to that House on the part of an individual, against whom all the influence of the Government would be arrayed, was likely to be attended with success ? (Hear, hear.) It was not necessary to refer the question to the arbitration of a lawyer, for he had no doubt Sir C. Barry would be perfectly ready to abide by the decision of an unprofessional arbitrator. The committee must remember that Sir Charles was. asking for remuneration for his laboiur during a period of 20 years, and now the Government said to him, "We vilI prescribe what you shall receive, and, if you are not sat wied, we wil neither go to law nor submit the matter to arbitration." He hop,ed the Government would assent to some mode bv which the question might be finally determined, and that nothing more would be heard of it in that house beyond the statement that the dispute had been settled. Mrr. IL. CAMBERS said that, if Sir Charles Barry was desirous of maintaining the high position of the -Institute cf Architects, of which he was so eminent a member, he would do well to accept the offer of the Government. (Hear, hear.) There was a report to the effect that it would be necessary to incur a large additional expendituro in putting the clock- into the tower preDared for its reception. It appeared that, like Farmer Flamborough's picture, the clock had been made too large for the place intendedfor it, and howas anxious to know whether it would be necessary to erect a scaffolding for the purposeof raising te clock to the top of the tower. SirDB.IHALL said, the clock silreadyfinishea, was goixie remarkably well, and - would be placed in the tower without difficulty. He added, in correction of a rumour which had been extensively circulated, that the bells had not been cast, but that they would be so before the end of the year, and would be made of a convenient size. Mr. WISE said, that two or three years ago some uneasiness was felt with respect to the chacter of a good deal of the stonework in the ouses of Parliament, large masses having peeled off on- the side- facing the river and in manyof the courts. Underthese circiunstanoes the late Sir WiJiiai Molesworth ordered that a strict supervision should be exercised over the selection of atones, and it would bo satisfactory to the committee to know whether that supervision was continued. He wished also to ask whether the smUl of 1,6001. in the vote under discussion " on account of the clock for the clock-tower in New Palaco-yard" included the total cost of the cloc}k? Sir B.

Mr. SPOO-NER inquired whether the sum of 3,7W- for the salaries of persons in charge of the maintenance and repair of the building included the salary of the genkieman in chargo of the ventilating ? Mr. Gurnoy was aIpolnted upon the recommendation of a committee of the House, and there seemed to be a difference of opinion leenthe Treasury and him as tothe salary which he wa. iet eceive.

WLLIAXS observed that Mr. ben*del, the esvneer to the harbour of refuge, appeared tobe much in tle position of Mr. Barry, having already eceeded his estmate. How much more would have to be voted for the poxpoeew i queshon ? Sir C. WOOD said, that about 26,00V. additional would ba required. It wav but justice to MLr. fendel to say that hi's oniginnl planIs and estimates would have been ample for the objects contempLated; bu±,owig to.th1>econoeny odth' Hfouse, those plans and estimates had been cutailed to sc an extent that the harbour was found to, be nuch too sMIal for the reqturements of vessels. The-ue, however, which had been made of it as a harbour of refuge fully juatified Air. Rendel's orignal proposals. (Hear, hear. - Mr. WISE bore testimony to the vahue of the harbokr and the vote was then agreed to. So also were the votes of 233,0D00. for other harbours of refuge; and 3S84. for PortPatrick Harbour. Onthe vote of 41,2212. for public billdingsin. I-eland, Mr. BLACKBUEN pointed out an error-in the account connected with Dublin Castle, and, at his suggestion, Mr. WLSON consented to reduce the vote by 20010 The vote thus reduced was agreed to, as-was alss a- -ote of 19,350l. for expenses connected with Kingstown harbour. On the vote of 83,6W. for salaries and experses connecteA with the Houses of Parliament, lMr. PEIL2AT complained of the excessive fees which must be paid before a erson who felt himnself aggrieved could appear and state his grievance before a conmittee of that House. wr. IL CHAMBERS wished to mnow if any arrangement had been made since the death of l!r. Gurneywuithreforence to the shorthand writers employed by committees of the House ? He had been informed that, underthfe old arrangenent, there was a certain charge per day, and that Mr. Gurney received half of that ch3rge, while the other half was given to those by whom the real work was done. Tnat ap ed to him to be a very inequitable arrangement, andhe should like tok lmow if any derent one ha been made ? Mr. WIlSON said that on the death of Mr. Gurney-the Speaker sanctioned a new arrangement with Mr. Gurney, Jun., and no alteration was made as regarded the terms ulpon which Mr. Gurney should remunerate those whom he em- .That 'was not a matter to be arranged by- the Spe or the Clerk of the House, but rested entirely between Mr. Gurney and those psrsoes whom he employed.. The vote was then agreed to. The following votes were also agreed to:- -52,0951. for the salaries and expenses in the Treasury. 24,204. for the Home Department. UTpon the vote of 6S,2411. for the Fored-n Depariment, 3Mr. BLACKEBl N: remarked upon the large amount (35,000!.) set down for messengers' bills and expenses of extra couriers. F Mr. WILSONT said, the increased expenditure under this heAd was caused by the state of war, which of course led to the more frequent employment of couriers. The cost of ill these communications s borne by the Foreignoffice, not by the War-office. The vote was agreed to, as were also the following: 28,4521. for the Colonial Department. 6'1,0671. for the Privy Council and Board of Trade. 2,7001. for the Lord Privy Seal. 24,594!, for the Paymaster-Gener0a's Department. 6,4S31. for the Controller-General of the Exchequer. i Upon the vote of 23,313! for the Office of Workis and Public Buildings, Mr. WISE complained of the new appointments stated to have been made in this departmnent without submitting them to the Lords of the Treasury. Mr. WILSON denied that any such thing had taken place lately. Two years ago considerable alterations took place in the department, but all those alterations had the sanction of the Treasury. _Mr. WISE could only say that he held in his hand a despatch, dated January, 1856, addressed to the Lords of the Treasury, and signed by Mr. Romnilly, M. tRoss, and Colonel Mberly, who stated decidedly that there were several cases of new appointments and increase of salaries w, hich were not supported by their lordehips' authority ; ana thisalluded especially to the Board of Works and to the different departments under that hoard. the vote was agreed to, together withl 21,66-1 for the office of Woods, Forests, andLand Revenues; and 16,447!. for the department of Public Records. On the vote of 20S,993l. for expenses connected -with the adiministration of the Poor Laws, Mrr. S. FITZGERALD said that, though he believed reductions had taken place in the staff of the Poor Law Board in Ireland, the state of the country was so satisfactory that there was not sufficient wvork even for those at present enmploved. He hoped to see further reductions effected under this head. Mr. HORSMIN observed that the expense of the Irish Poor Law Board was now only one-half what it Ws four years ago. The vote was agreed to. On the vote of 48,8291. for the expenses of the Mint, including coinage, Mr. PELL_TT asked in what way the increase of., 10,0004. for coinage had arisen ? -Yr. WILSON replied that the expense of the coiny- depended entirely upon the amount coined. The Master of: the Mint had reason to anticipate a much larger co nage. than in the past year, and, therefore, the estimate was pro-. po-ionately large. Mr. SPOONERX inquired how this estimate s arrivef at! ]Mr. WIL,SON said, the Master of the Mint usnually Pu! himself in communication with the Bank on the subjecd In the present case, the belief was that if gold came in' a this country in large quantities, as it was likely to do during the ensuing year, and, at the same time, th ere was no commensurate return of the rmoney sent out to the East, it would be necessary considerably to increas . the coinage. The vote was agreed to. A vote of 23,145!. for sn?eCt0or; of factories, - - sa *hen agreed to. On a vote being proposoa- of 35,96. Is. 4d. for the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Bemembraucer in the Exche quer and offices in Scotland, lOr. W.

Mr. WISE observed that-the sums voted for the Queen's Plate for- zces. ai Scotland. as well a& in Ireland were no charge o the country, an they were fermerly charged onthe hereAi tard revenue. The sums reQired under this head for iSoilandwere7. lSs., whereas the SlUnI annually voted for 15 Queen's Plates to ho n for in Ireland wa 1,6741. fs. 2d. The vote was then agreeZa to. Upon a vote of 6,431!. lIs. 6d. for the household of the Lord- ieutenant of Irdand, Mr. WI nAM inted out some of t'he items eompaodg the vote--for che as tr of the Horse two gentlenmen-S large, Cork herald; onec lettle drummer, and thee StaW truspqetass,&e.-nnd dcSSi any .no to defeud thisridienloua srlipberaalia of msock Roalty. 1 Ir. iIILACKIITltX onculrred in i-hiiiking such ubargC occasion, aud he thought that the present discuss3on showea that at no moment had it been more imperfect and sfeeble than at the present, when the public expenditure wasgreatly increased. He trusted tbe Govermuent would not press the conniaittee to come to 'an immediate decision on the vote. Mr. WILSON acceded to the postponement of tho vote. Mr. WILLIAMS thought that the noble lordat the head oftheGovernment,theChancellor of theExchequer, and the Secretary of the Treasury had all three completely broken down in their attempts to explain this vote, and they. had therefore done wisely in acceding to the suggestion of, the right hon. gentleman opposite to postpoie it for the present. The vote was accordingly postponed. On the vote of 17,7101. for the Copyhold Enolosure ai d Tithe Commission, Mr. WILIaAMS thought it wvas quite time that this commission was wound up. at any rate, there was no need for three commissioners. Their dealings were entirely with private property, and it was unjust that the public funds should be called on to defray an expenditure which merely benefitted private proprietors. The CHAINCELLOR of the E{XCHEQUER said that the functions of the commission, though relating to private property, were essentially public functions, which , until intrusted to this commission, had formerly been exercised by the Legislature. The commission was of the greatest benefit to tho pubEc and saved considerable expense. The vote was then agreed to, as were the following votes:- 11,7101. for the expenses incurred under tho Enclosure and Drainage Acts of this commission. 38,2341. for the salaries and expenses of the General Re. gister-office in England and Wales. 3,388. for the expenses of the General Register-office in Dublin. 6,6651. for the salaries and expenses of tho General R;egister-office in Scotland. 13,8S01. for the salaries and expenses of the National Debt-office. 2,8401. for the expenses of the Public *orks Loan Comnmission. 1,5701. for the expenses of the West Indian Islands Relief Commission. 1,3101. for the expenses of the office of the Commissioners in Lunacy. 9841. for the salaries and expenses of the general superintendents of the county roads in South Wales. 1,4051. for the salaries and expenses in the departmnent of the registrar of friendly societies in England. 32,0001. for secret service. Mlr. W. WILLIAMS congratulated the House upon the fact that, not only had there been no increase of this last vote in consequence of the war, but that there was actuaUy a considerable reduction in its amount. On the vote of 458,2751. for printinr and stationery for the Houses of Parliamnent and the pubMic departments, MIr. WALPOLE called attention to the very large amount of the vote. Last year there was a deficiency of 50,0001., which had to be provided for now; and the increase in the vote, as compared with that of last year, including this deficiency, was 40,000!. During the last session there was a committee on the subject of printing, which reported that the contracts with the printers to the two Houses could not,'.without violating the understanding that they should continue as long as the patent of Mr. Spottiswoode, be altered umtil the year 1860. At the same time there was one portionof printing,thatwhichincluded works printed by the public departments, and the reports and appendices of commissions and committees, in which a very considerable saving might be effected. (Hear, hear.) There were appendices which noble lords and hon. gentlemen in that house read which contained pages upon pages of figures and names, the general results cf aU which information were given in the reports. When examined before the committee, Mir. hl'Culloch, who had carefully and attentively considered the question, suggested that either that House or the printing committee should exercise some control as to the occasions on which these appendices should be printed. The chairman of the coinmnittee might decide whether or not the aDpendices to the evidence should be published. It was most important that attention should be paid by the Government, or, failing that, by the House, to the revision of tho thlce classes of printing to which he had referred, especially of that connected with commissions. Almost all cominssions now 3eported to the Secretary of State for the Home Department5 andtheir reports were then laid upon the tables ofbth houses. All the evidence, let it be ever so voluminous and ever so immaterial, was appended to the reports and printed at the expense of the public. He (Mr. Walpole) thought that the chairman of a commission ought to communicato with the head of the department to which he reported as to the evidence which should be printed, and that his recommendation, subject to the control of the head of the department, should be acted upon. As to the reports of committees of that house, he thought that the reccmmendation of the committee, that the chairman should in every instance recommend in his report how much of the agppndices should be printed, might well be acted upon. (Hear, hear.) The CIANCELLOR of theEXCHEQUER was glad that his right hon. friend had called attention to the large amount of this vote, which equalled the entire income of a small German principality. There was, he thought, great reason why an attempt should be made to reduce it within moderate limits. As to the reports of commissions, an order was some years ago given by the Home Department that no com. mission should insert any document in an aFpendix or send it to the printer, without an express autnori'y from the Secretary of State. HIe wasnotsurethat thatorder had always heen obeyed, but it was givenL §ve or six years ago, and bad the effect oE materially diminishing the bulk of the appendices to reports. As to the reports of committees of that House no 'such control had ever existed; and it would be a very delicate matter to interfere with the authority of committees to insert what documents they pleased in their report. NTevertheless, he thought all members would admit that many documents found their way into appendices which were not worth the expense of printing. It would be very aseful if either the printing, or some other committee, would exercise a control over the documents which -were inserted in reports. The great bulk of the reports, both of commissions and committees, however, consisted of evidence, and he did not see how it would be possible to make a selection of evidence to be printed, without leading to never. ending charges of partialty and unfairness. The expenses of printing in the public offices had of late years increased, owmg to the habit of printing great numbers of forms of eccounts. That had arisen from the great increase in the amount of statistical information called for by that House, and indicated a laudable desire to furnish to Parliament ample accounts of the expenditure of the country. Mr. WALPOLE; mentioned as instances of unnecessary expense the volumes issued by the committee of council on education. The reports contained in these books were very valuable, but thelong lists of names appendedto them were worth nothing at alL Yet the great expense arose from the printing of these lists, The Board of health had also expended large sums upon Printing. The present estimate for that department was 1,200!.; and he had been informed that there were of the books published by that board 30,000 copies stDIl unissued. Wr. CRAUFURD reminded the House that it was necessary for the convenience of members thlat the evidence taken before a committee should be printed during the progress of the inquiry; and that, therefore, the principal portion of the expense, that ofsetting up thetype,mnst be incurred, whether or not the evidence were afterwards reprinted withthe report. A great evil of the present system was th..t no attempt was uade to regulate the issue of Parliamentary papers according to the intrinsic attraction of the topics to which they referred, papers of merely local interest being circulated as profusely as documents of historic importance. Tne papers relating to the capitulation of Kars were already out of print. Mr. V. SMITH commended the zeal of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Walpole) on this question, and suggested that he should make it the subject of a resolution, and so obtain the formal decision of the House upon it. The real sinners were the members themselves, who were continually calling for all manner of returns. (Hear, hear.) It should be left to the decision of the Printing Coommittee, or of some other body to deterniine what docunients should be printed. (Hear.) Mr. HENLEY would be glad if it should be found possible to reduce the vote -without injury to the public service, but confessed that he was no advocate for cutting down the printing too much. Mr. WILSON explained that in the military and naval departments there was an increase of expenditure from 32,0001. to 107,0001.; but this was solely attributable to the war. Mr. DISRAELI regretted that he could not view the question in the same light as his right hon. friend (hrr. Falpole), and obsenred that, even though half-a-.ilon sterling had been expended in publishing the result of the. inquiries instituted by Parliamentary committees, and in obtaining the information on which those tribunals had founded their decisions, he should hesitate before. he sanctioned a reduction i that expenditure. (Hear, hear.) If in their attempts to procure the most faith-worthy information on question8 of the most momentoes importance committees were to be hampered by considerations of expensc, a serious restriction would ho im- posed on that publicity which was the soul of good government. (Hear, hear.) The money was not misapplied that was devoted to the production of that great body of Parliamentary literature which was one of the most remarkable characteristics of the day, and which contributed not a Ettle to the sound and judicious administration of pubEc affairs. (Hear.) Thero could be no second opinion as to the necessity of printing, not only the reports of committees, but tho evidence on which those reports were based; the only objection was to the appendices. These, it was said, were of little interest or value. He did not think so. (Hear, hear.) It would be no difficult matter to enumerate manyoccasions on which the facts and statements contained in those supplements had influenced the debates in that house and the deliberations of Ministers. If the whole expenditure upon Parliamentary publications was 100,0001. a-year, and if the g-reater portion of that amount was expended upon reports and evidence, a small sum only being devoted to explanatory documents, he did not think the expenditure could be regarded as excessive, when they remembered that it afforded to the House and to the public accurate and ample information with regard to important subjects which affected the destinies and fortunes of the country. They might be assured that if they. reduced the importance of the documentary evidence taken by their committees, which guided the opinion avMd the judgment of the House, they would materially diminish their influence. They had been told by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the amount expended in printing and publishing papers for the information of the House of Commons exceeded the revenue of many German princes; but it must be-remembered that this expenditure was incurred not merely for tho information of members of that House, but for the information of the country. He might remind the committee that, during the last year, expenditure had been incurred for transports, and for many ether purposes, wrhich might as justly have been met by the argument that the a-mount expended exceeded the revenue

LONDON, TUESDAY, APRTL 1, 1856. The House of Cornnons re-assembled yesterday, and, having resolved itself into a Committee of Supply, entered forthwith upon the consideration of the Civil Service Estimates. In the course of the discussion, Colonel FEnaxCH complained that no conimunication had been made to the House relative to the treaty of peace, and moved that the Chairman report progress, in order that the Fasr Mnsr -of the CRow-N might offer some explanation upon the subject. Lord PAiuaS?TOx said the public business had -commenced that evening at an unusually early hour, and he had been detained until a few minutes after the House had resolved itself into a Committee of Supply, otherw-ise he should have made the statement which he was now prepared to make, and which was a very short one. The House was aware, le observed, that a treaty of peace had been signed -at Paris, and that it had been determined by the Congress that the particular conditions of the -treaty should not be made public until the ratifications had been exchanged, which was the usual course. At the same time, -without going into any details, his conviction was that the treaty would be deemed satisfactory by this country and by Europe; that it would be found that the objects of the war had been fully accomplished; that the independence and integrity of the Turkish empire hacl been secured, as far as those ends could be -effected by such arrangements; in short, that the treaty was honourable to all parties, and that it wouild lay the foundation of a lasting peace. The ratifications were to be exchanged as soon as they could be received from Constantinople and St. Petersburg, and he hoped the interchange would take place at Paris in three weeks. Colonel FsRxcH thereupon withdrew his motion, zand the Committee resumed the discussion of the Estinates. Certain votes having been agreed to, the Chairman was ordered to report progress. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to. P.r. CowiER, in moving the second reading of the Vaccination Bill, explained the provisions of the -3Xisting law,-and stated that that law having been found defective, and further provisions being required in order to makle its machinery work pro: perly, this bill repealed the existing acts and consolidated their enactments with the new provisions, under wvhich the system of vaccination in this country would be more complete and satisfactory. He specified the causes to which he ascribed the imperfect action of the e.xisting law and the mode in which it was proposed to remedy it, justifying the qualified compulsion umder that law, with the principle of which the bill did not interfere. Mr. HEs-N-L thought some of the details of the bill, especially the introduction of two conflicting authorities-the Poor Law Board and the Board of Health-extremely objectionable. Mr. MiscuIE= spoke at much lengtlh against the bill, contending that, while vaccination was no protection against the small-pox, it imDorted hereditary and other diseases into pure bloo^d. After a few words from Mr. BRADY, 31r. BAuRRow objected to the bureaucratic prin-ciple of the bill and to its compulsory principle. MIr. MIIL likewise entered his protest against the compulsory principle, which, in his opinion, impeded the progress of vaccination. The bill was read a second time. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency (Ireland) Bill was also read a second time. Sir S. JfORTahCOTE obtained leave to introduce a blll to amend the naode of committing criminal and vaggrant children to reformatory and industrial schools. The remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at 20 minutes to 2 o'clock.
It is a painful satire upon human happiness that. peace, so dear to nations, is, after all, only a negative blessing. Certainly it is a matter of inmmense congratulation that men should no longer devote themselves to mutual destruction, and that is the state we call peace. The sufferers by an acute disease declare that there is no pleasure like the cessation of pain. Be it little or much, the whole of the matter for which the guns have been firing, the bells ringing, and people have been going about congratulating one another, is the cessation of a horrible social disorder. We are now only as -we were three years ago, except with some corrected tendencies, some reformed habits, and some improved experiences. Could the nations of Europe have learnt wisdom more cheaply than by emperience,-could any nation, or anybody, learn wisdom except in the old fashion, Europe would now be the better by more than half a million of mnen, a hundred millions of money, and much more that cannot be numbered, or even named. The proclamation of peace is nothing more nor less than the exposure of a colossal haUucination, or, to resort to our first image, the cure of a hideous disease. MIortifying indeed it is to human pride that the very best thing we have to boast of, and the happiest thing to be thanliul for, is that tne principal nations of the civilized world are no longer doing that which is the. ordinary employment of the most brutal savages. This is the utmost that can be said. It is onlya .lucid interval in the history of the worlds madness. Indeed, this particular evil, the design of one gigantic empire against the liberty. of Europe, has Len a whole century in progress, grfidually, and of late rapidly, -ripening into action. Twoyears of war have dissipated a century of preparations, and brought the East and the West of Europe to the same point of common understanding anid mutual respect at which they stood at the beginninig of the period; so vast is the accumulation of thought, industry, providence, and natural resources thus throw-n away, all for want of a little common sense, as we now see in this instance; though the same foUy may recur any day in any other quarter. When a bubble of a century's growth has thus burst in two years, and the greatest military Power in the world has received so sharp and sudden a check in its long career, it would be expected, perhaps, that other nations would take warning. Unfortunately the national vrits, for such we must call it, which, after woiking a century in the constitution, breaks out in this violent form and demands this rough remedy, is so subtle, so fertile in flattering illusions, and so apt to assume an apparently exceptional form, that the most fearful example may be lost upon it. There are two empires in modern times which have been regarded as similar in many substantial circumstances, and even in some points of policy, and which have ever cherished themselves the idea of their similarity. Russia and the United States have avowed a sort of particular respect for one another, as the Cossack and the Republican in the political scale. With the single exception that they carry out the opposite extremes of government, though equally without constitutional balance or check, they equally boast unlimited territory, rapid growth, great military success, and an opinion of their resources and prowess which has hitherto met with no check. They have hitherto been equally confident of their destiny, that old stumbling-block of new nations. They have equally fostered maxims that cannot be admitted by their neighbours without a sacrifice of self-respect. Ever since the year 1775the two Governments have been interchanging compliments. It was only on Saturday that we inserted the harangue of an American senator, containing a favourable comparison between the two Governments. Now, it is rather a remarkable thing, and to be noted in the history of human delusions, that at the very moment when the one bubble has burst, when Rlussia!s dream of irresistible power and endless dominmon has been rudely and finally dispelled, the other Power, the self-boasted parallel, the brother in boundless pretension and special immunity, so far from taking warning by the fate of its compeer, is at this moment verging to the same suicidal follya war, not of self-defence, but of wanton defiance, the sole and avowed object of which is the assumption of a political position above all the rest of the world. The phrase two years ago was that we had "drifted" into war. No doubt, there had been such a gradual and almost imperceptible current, latterly assisted by timid and irresolute counsels. The contrast between the causes and the event is that between a. drift and a collision. A thousand ebullitions of national vanity and imperial ambition, golden reveries, confidential conversations, diplomatic insolences, overreaching negotiations, Ene upon line and precept upon precept, have constituted the current on which Russia has drifted to where she now lies. We have no wish whatever to deny the faults of the Powers who have had to teach her this lesson. They have suffered, and probably will suffer in turn, for errors which are shared by all States in proportion to their spirit and their power. We have only to do now with the one gigantic folly which led Russia to imagine herself exempted from t.he common lot and common law of nations. Such notions have been cherished by some State or other in every age since the beginning of the world. We believe there never was a time since t he beginning of history when there was not one, or more than one State, which conceived itself either so numerous, or so well situated, or so rich, or so ingenious, or so united, or so martial, or so pious, or so favoured by Hx&EAvr, or so pre-etninent for some other great quality, that it might safely defy all the rest of the world, set up its own rules, be its own law, and entertain schemes incompatible with the peace of the world. No such nation ever yet succeeded in this course or escaped the most signal chastisement. That has now fallen upon Russia, even at the hands of neighbours who have good reason to admit the martial virtues and the almost unlimited resources of the delinquent. Is it possible that any other empire in the world, especially that empire which is ever matching itself with Russia and claiming the benefit of the Russian example, should choose this very time for asserting its most preposterous claims? All Europe is now resounding with the gratefiil notes of peace. Every State rejoices for the event which secures " the inte" grity and independence" of a weak people against the schemes of a powerful neighbour. We trust the triimph will not be marred, the hymn of praise jarred, and the universal judgment defied by the appearance of a new dictator in the Western hemisphere, as imperious, as egotistical, as resolved tc give its own law to the world, and as certain to be brought under the world's law, as that which has just made its timely submission to a European Congress.
Powerful friends can, no doubt, confer great benefits occasionally, and it is well for men or nations to have them, but when potentates condescend to interfere in the concerns of others their kindness, not unfrequently, iz of a somewhat offhand and cavalier nature, and the protected party, though grateful, no doubt, is still apt to sigh for its old independence, however unstable and menaced. France and England entered into their late war with such earnestness as almost to forget that they were only seconds, and that the principal in the struggle was the old and spirited, though much maimed, antagonist of Russia. By their interference the war, in diplomatic language, attained European dimensions, and was pursued as if Turkey and her quarrel only gave the occasion for carrying out a grand political design. England has had her vague purpose of quenching the spirit of Russian aggression, and the world has attributed to her more definite plans of checking her adversary's progress in Asia, and guarding against a march to the Indus. For a quarter of a century France has spoken officially of Poland, and recognized the rights of what the CzAR has declared to be a defunct nationality. Austria has looked for emancipation from the uneasy tllraldom of a too powerful ally. German Tiberals in general -have hoped for mighty consequences. Sweden - has not wholly forgotten the province which was hers less than half a century ago. Constitutionalism, democracy, and socialism have had their aspirations, all only remotely associated with the immediate concerns of Turkey and the strict motive of the war. But the Turks have confined themselves to the original question with characteristic tenacity. Poland and Finland, popular progress and liberal principles, have been the subjects of no speculations among them. They went to war to oust the Russians from their territory, and with this result they have been quite content. As far as they have had an ulterior object, it is to manage matters so that with decent haste their allies should followv the example of tlleir enemies and withdraw 'their legions from the' SurMTAN's neighbourhood. If we may guess at the feelings of what is called an ,jlightened-Pasha on hearing the news-of peacc, WC Xji, uld attributo to him a somewhat complacent ;elief thlf' whatever his faithful allies may think of their tlc. luoes, Turkey-probably will have no causeto compia;n of fortune, or of her own statesmen'sskil. She ad not desire much, but all that she wanted she is ukely tD obtain. A comparison of what ihe pdrTEr wis willing to assent to in 1853 and what it lay;! claim to now will show any politician that his an is not ill understood by the calm and stolid fun,tionaries who administer affairs in Stamboul. We can well fancy thatjthe cannon of r-oicing will awaken the echoes of tho Bosphorus, aiad that mosques and minarets3will be in a blaze of light. The Mussulman will forget his early hours, for in every coffeehouse there will be much to communicate. The news may not be the most accurate, the speculations may not be very profound, but politics will be discussed everywhere, and the anticipations of the Moslem will be by no nmeans unpleasant. Turkey has had its war of two years and a-half, and the results are intelligible to the most simple mind. The Russiaiis were to march on Constantinople, and they have not come; the allies were encamped about the -city for an indefinite time, and now they are -likely to depart. The latter blessing will be the morc appreciated as it has yet to be enjoyed, and as the deliverance will be from a pressure whick is present and obvious. But even the check which Russia has received will not fail to be valued. The poorest Turk has heard from infancy of the dreaded race which had torn valuable possessions from the SuLTAN, and with wonderful art, tuned each new fortress or harbour into the means of further menace. They will now be told that the danger is over, and that they have won enduring victories over the only great State with which in late ages they have been at war. WVhile the thoughts of the WVest once more revert to their accustomed topics, while the name of Peace falls tamely on the English ear, and finds even the Continent only compensating public disappointment by private ease, the cannons, the illuminations, and gazettes of Constantinople will not unjustly give to the Mussulman the notion of a triumph. He has gained something, and may hope to gain more. Such hopes are, perhaps, doomed to be transient, but certainly no man can at present pronounce them baseless. The more educated Minister of the PORTE will not be indisposed to thank PROVIDENCE or Destiny. He will think that Turkey has come very well out of a terrible danger. Three years since a spirit of fanaticism was roused by the agt%gression of Russia. Turkey, though poor in wealth, had been, tranquil for many years, the SuLTAN's authority had been acknowledged in the most distant provinces, and a large population was ready to supply men for a war. In a sudden fit of boldness the PORTE declared war against its powerful enemy, and took the lead in Europe. It was a perilous step, antd when the consequences wvere seen few were the Turks who did not stand disuiayed. France and England with large armies occupied the capital and every important point of the coast; Russia was bringing her whole resources into the field, seemingly resolved on a struggle of years; Austria was ready with immense forces on the frontier, and the only hope of ex-pelling the CzAR from the Principalities was by ceding them for a term to a Power which was supposed equaUy to covet them. As time advanced the prospect darkened. Battle, famine, neglect, destroyed the Ottoman levies; on the Danube, in the Crimea, in Asia, thousands perished who could never be replaced. The resources of the country failed; war could only be continued by loans, which would give the Christian Powers a lasting lright of interference in Turkish concerns. More. than these was the changed feeling of the allies a matter for apprehension. England, at least, had commenced the war with loudly expressed admiration for the Turks. A few months had seen these favourable opinions vanish, and unconcealed dislike and contempt tak-e their place. The alied Generals almost took the command of the Turkish army, and directed the Turkish Councils. Every man in office desired peace, for in the gains of merchants and contractors he could not participate, while the dearness of every necessary made it more difficult to live. We may judge then of the satisfaction with which the news of Russian concession was received. The war has just- lasted long enough for the allies .to destroy Russian supremacy without having substituted their own. The CzAR is expelled from the Principalities, and nowthe PoRTz talks of the edicts of AHorE;T rI., and is resolved to oppose any foreign interference in Moldo-Wallachia, just as if four centuries were a dream. The SuLTAx publishes an edict, which does little more than recapitulate what was granted to the Christians many years since, and, though we have been talking for three years of reform and regeneration, yet we are told that it is a mere internal arrangement, and that its execution must not be guaranteed by treaty. Servia and Montenegro are no longer under Russian influence, and we have no reason to believe that any foreign protectorate will take its place. In facts the Turk has kept us to our word about the independence and integrity of his empire. We promised that; he in return made no stipulations, and will try to make no concessions. As far as we can at present judge our Eastern allies have cause to congratulate themselves, and will, no doubt, celebrate the advent of peace with greater exultation than ourselves.
The return of the revenue for the quarter ending last night is very little more than a simple record of increased taxation. The total net increase on the quarter, compared with the first quarter of last year, is 1,477,6451. In the Customs the increase has been 497,0581., and arises from a greatly-increased revenue upon tea, coffee, tobacco, wine, and other items, while there has been some decrease in the revenue from sugar, spirits, andc timber. There has been an increase of 37,0821. on the quarter's Excise. In the Stamps, on the other hand, the partial repeal of the duty on newspapers has caused a decrease of 55,7681. on the quarter. In the receipts from Land and Assessed Taxes, the Propertyand Incometax, and the other heads of revenue, there is nothing worthy of remark, the increase on the Property-tax being simply the doubling of the old rates. The difference of the receipts under the several heads of revenue for the whole year ended March 31, 1856, compared with the previous year, has already been, comprehended in our remarks on the last three quarters; we have therefore only to observe that the net increase of revenue for the whole year has been 4,497,6711. If this does not seem so satisfactory as miight be expected, it must be remembered that the total revenue for the year ending March 31, 1855, was no less than 61,206,8181.; and the revenue for the year just ended-viz., 65,704,489.-ias unewampled since the close of the last war.
The convict BousFrY: was exocuted, or tortured to death, yesterday morning at the Old Bailey. It is our most painful duty to lay before our, readers an account of what passed on the occauion, and long may it be before a duty of the same Idnd may devolve upon us again! Such a spectacle as the one which was presented yesterday morning to the eyes of some four or five thousand spectators has not been seen in England in our time. The f-ts of the ase stand as follows .-For the two dayx pr6oge his remutlon the wretched muirderer, BOuSFIELD, seems to have sunk under the horrors of his -position. We have no wish to repeat here what will be found rebted at length in another portion' of our columns. We pas -therafore at once to yesterday morning-4he morning of his execUtinn.- - As thie fatal hour ipproached BOUSFrIxa'S strength and resolution entirely =:ave way. When the Sheriffs and Ordinary entered hi cell they found him seated on a chair, supported by itwo men. He neither spoke nor attemptea to speal. Restoratives were administered, but without any effect, and then the Sheriffs most prudently and humanely resolved to cut short the dreadful acene, and gave the signal for the procession to move on. BousFrxa could not stand. One of the turnkeys took hold of him by the shoulders and another by the legs, and in this condition, " nearly doubled up," the :wretched creature was carried to the scaffold. All this while the prison bell was tolling-the Ordinary was reading the funeral service. A difficulty arose. How was the murderer to be carried up the steps which led to the platform ? Some one suggested that a chair should be brought. A high-backed chair was. accordingly procured from the Governor's office; BOUSP3riD was placed upon it, and so carried up, and seated upon the drop. So far no blame is attributable to anybody. To the officers of the prison and to the Sheriffs the discharge of a most painful duty had been intrusted, and. they were bound to carry it through. lVhen matters had proceeded thus far the executioner came forward to perform his part.- It is said to have been remarked by the bystanders that he was under the influence of great nervousness and agitation. In a hurried manner he pulled the cap over BousFiEL'S head, adjusted the noose, and ran down below. It must be remembered that all this time the doomed maan was seated upon the chair. On a sudden, and without waiting for the signal, the executioner shot back the bolt, the chair fell through, and the miserable creature was suspended by his neck. At this moment began the unusual horror of the scene. Scarcely had a second or two elapsed when the wretch.ed man's strength, which for 48 hours previously had been so completely prostrated, seemed to return to him in a preternatural manner. His convulsions were awful. Hle succeeded in placing frst one foot and then the other on the side of the scaffold. The turnkeys went on the scaffold, and pushed his legs away. Again the effort was repeated, and with the like success. The executioner clung to the man's legs. As soon as he rel-aed lils hold the same convulsive effort was repeated, and again the wretched creature regained his foothold. Again he was cast off, and a fourth timae-happily this was the last-he planted his feet on the edge of the scaffold. A fourth time he was cast off; and with a few more feeble struggles the horrid scene was brought to a close. If we recapitulate in this prominent manner the details of this di3gustin.- story, it is because we earnestly trust that publicity is the best guarantee against the recurrence of any similar horror. If we cannot, from regard to the safety of society, assent to the opinions of those persons who wish to see capital punishment abolished, even in cases of murder, we are of course desirotis that no effort should be spared to make the violent passage from life to death as instantaneous andw painless as possible, even for the most atrocious criminal. Nothing horrible of this kind has occurred in England in our recollection. The fair inference is that the machinery is generally complete enough, and on this occasion it seems probable that the main cause of these convulsive struggles arose from the fact that the wretched prisoner was seated upon a chair, and not standing upright, when the, bolt was drawn. The body, consequently, had a shorter fall, and life was not destroyed at once, as' has hitherto almost invariably happened. It is not, :however, either our wish or our duty to criticize the details of such scenes, to point out. what was wrong, or to sugggest how it should be made right. The smallest effort of commoi sense should surely enable those persons whose duty it is to preside over such mattersto guard against the recurrence of such dreadful and afflicting scenes as those of yesterday. Having said thus much, we will venture to add that, in our opinion, if capital punishment is to remain as part of the law of the land, there was no possibility of relieving Bousrirs from the penalty. Even in the midst of our horror at the method of. his death we cannot forget that far more terrible and awful scene in which he was the chief actor. Let those who shudder over the details of his fate give a thought to the ghastly bodies of his wife and three children as they lay weltering in their blood. It was he, the husband and the father, who destroyed their innocent lives, and therefore it was that he in turn forfeited his life to the violated laws of his country and of humanity.
THE PRUSSIAN MARRIAGE. (From the Economist.) it is understood that rxince Frederiok of Prussia has formally asled and obtained the sanction of the King to his regneetingo in marriage the Princess Rzoyal of England. The pu]ct fthis proceeding is sup posed to imply a know. ledo tat heEnglish Court aj app rove the union proposed. A choice in every wfay more suitable and satisfactory, we think, could harly have been suggested; and 'ie are at a loss to account for the indignation felt or assumed some time ago in one isolated quarter by the rumour that such an alliance was in contemplation. At that time, it is true, Prussia-or rather the Prussian Court -was generally suspected of an unfriendly feeling towards this country, and a leaning towards our enemy. Yet, even then, report affirmed that both Prince Frederick and his father look-ed with suspicion upon the designs of Russia, and were favourably inclined towards the Western Powers. It would have seemed, therefore, that, iDA proportion to the mischievous effects we felt and apprehended from the family influence brought to bear by Russia upon the mina of the King, should have been the diligence of our endea vours to cultivate to the utmost the friendship of his probable successor. Now, at all events, when the prospect of peace seems certain andimmediate, we caunot but rojoice at the announcement of a marriage which will cement our allianoe'with the second Protestant Power of Europe. We have spoken on a previous occasion of the difficulties attending the selection of a consort for any member of the Roval Family. Marriage with a subject or with a Catholic Prince is utterly out of the question. Their choice, therefore, is limited in the extreme, and has for the most part been limited to the- petty Protestant Princes of Germany T'lhe disadvantages attending this limitation are =uficientl evident, and we do not wish to dweUlnponthem. We would merely remark that, if nothing else were to be hoped from the marriage in question, it is a matter of no trifling importance to break through the narrow circle by which the matrimonial choice of our Royal Family has hitherto been circumscribed..- There is not, and never can be, any serious danger lest English politics should be mischievously influenced by the foreign connexions of our Royal FanUily - and we think that those who entertain any suspicion of the lind must have formed a very low idea of the character of the British Court and the independence of British statesmen. There is no reason to apprehend lest, in this country, the personal influence of the Sovereign should eYer be exerted to the detriment of the public interest. On the other hand, that influence might often be of mnaterial service to us in our relations with countries where the supreme tower is practically vested in the Crown, and where the individual will of the Monarch determines the policy of his Government. A cordial alliance with Prussia-would befor England an acquisition of no trifling importance. It is;in the highest degree necessary to ustowecure aninfluenceinGermanywhichwould einable us to counteract any future machinations on the partof Russia, whose power in German affairs has been for a longi stedly increasing. In this respect the interests of Pussia are identical with our own. She has I far more to fear than we have from the encroachments of her restless and ambitious neighbour. As the most powerful Protestant State in Germany, she is at once our natural ally and the natural leader of by far the greater portion of the German States, with most of which she is moreover connected by the comu-ercial federation of the ZoUverein. Her support would enable us to obtain a position and influence in Germany equal, if not superior, to that of Russia. Sach influence-would be an invaluable acquisition for ourselves, for the German People, and for Europe at large, assuring to ns the cordial friendship of a nation umited to us by the ties of commcn blood ind common interest,. liberating Germany froni the baleful as cendancy of the great representative and upholder of despotism, and constituting her a reliable barrier against Russian encroachments to the westward.
-TE - --THE --PEACE. - - . porion of the following wpeared In ow ue#ond edition of yesterday:-- (From the london GazdteMc Bzraordinary.) FOREIGN-OFFICB, -I&iCH 31 1. A despatch has been this morning received from the E:arl of Clarendon, Eer Majetys Principal Secretary of State for ForeigniAffairs, dated Paris, ,March 30, announci ng the signature of peace at 2 0'clo0k on that day, at the Foreign-office in Paris. The Plenipotentiaries of Great Britain, of Ausria, of France, -of ta,ssia, of Russia, of Sardinia, and of Turkey, have affixed their signatures to the treaty which putg an end to t1he war; and which, while definitively settling the Eastem qntion, estsblishes the tranquillity of Europe on solid and durable bases. The exchange of the ratifications will takeplace at Paris in four weeks, or sooner, if possible; until that time the stipulations of the treaty cannot be made public. (From the' Supplement to the London Gazedt B-draordinary of Monday, March 31.) FOREIGN-OFFICE, M&uc: 31L The Hon. Spencer Ponsonby arrived at the Foreign-office this morning from Paris, with the defnitive treaty for the restoration of peace, and for the maintenance of the integrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire, which was yesterday signed atParis by. the Plenipotentiaries of Her Majesty, of the Emperor of the French, of the King of Sardinia, and of the Sultan, and also of the Emperor of Austria and of the King of Pru.ssia, on the one part, and of the Emperor of all the Russias on the other. We have received the Monifeur of yesteraay. It publishes the official announcement of the signature of peace precisely in the same terms as Lord Clarendon's despatch announcing the fAct to the English Government. The Moniteur adds s- " The Plenipotentiaries of the Congress met at noon yesterday, in uniform, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to sign the treaty. Immediately after the sitting althe Plenipotentiaries proceeded in a body to the Tuileries, where they had the honour of being received by the Emperor. "1 At 2 o'clcck a salvo of 101 guns announced the conclusion of peace to the population of Paris. " In the evening the whole city was spontaneously illuminated in the most brilliant manner." (aoxr OUR OWN COn ZSrOET.) PARIS, SuNDAY, )ARCH 30, 6 P.i. The great question that has kept all Europe in sspense for weeks past is at last resolved. The treaty of peace with Russia was signed between 1 and 2 o'lock this day, itt the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The guns of thu Invalides have announced the fact to the population of Paris, and before the hour at which I am now writingthetidingswilhave been borne on the electric wires to the remotest part of the French territory. I telegraphed to you at midday that within an hour or two Peace would be concluded, and again when the intelligence was communicated in a supplement to the Moniteiur. A 'Council of Mnisters was held at the Tuileries at half-past 11 o'clock, and remained sitting till a quarter-past 12. The Emperor presided, and gave his last instructions, and Count Walewski returned to his official residence to receive the Plenipotentiaries. They appeared in full uniform, and wore all their orders and decorations. They assembled in the SaZIe des Conf6rences before half-past 12, and after the treaty was read over proceeded to sign it in the same alphabetical order in -which they have been wont to talke their places during the conferences. Crowds of people had been out from an early hour, as it was known that something important was to occur, and numerous groups of spectators gathered on the quays opposite and close to the Foreign-office to see the Plenipotentiaries pass. These were received, both on going and returning, with marks of great respect from the people. Everything took place as I had mentioned. The moment the signatures were completed the expected signal was given, and the cannon fromthe esplanade of the Invalides proclaimed the news before the Plenipotentiaries had quitted the hall. Soon after the following notice was posted up on the waUs of Pais .- "CONGRESS OF PARIS, ?Ancn 30, 18.56 "Peace has been signed this day, at 1 o'clock, at the Mrinistry of Foreign Affairs. *ThePlerapotentiaries of France, Austria, GreatBritain, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and Tulrkey, have affi;xed their signatures to the treaty which puts an end to the present war, and which, by settling the question of the East, establishes the ropose of Europe on solid and durable bases." The notice was signed by the Prefect of Police,. and, I need hardly say, was read by thousands -with intense curiosity, and with great satisfaction. Soon after appeared a supplement to the Monittev-, containing the same announcement. The effect produced is of course all that could be imagined, and the feeling would very probably have been much more strongly expressed, had it not been that for two or three days past the conclusion was confidently expected for this day. The weather is fine, the sk-y serene, the san warm and undimmed, and all the thoroughfares are thronged with people. Already preparations are made for the illuninations of to-night, which, it is expected, will rival the dispLay on the birth of the ImperialPrince. I should not omit the coincidence that Countess Walewalki, wife of the Minister for Foreign airs and Presi-' dent of the Congress, was delivered of a girl this morning at 9 o'clock, only three or four hours before her husband affixed his signature to the treaty -of peace. hePlenipotentiaries will continue to meet during the present week, as before, for the settlement of other matters, not of a light or unimportant character, which have not yet been settled. They and the resident members of the diplomatic corps dine, in full uniform, with the Minister of Foreign, Affairs to-morrow. The treaty will not be mado public until the exchange of the ratifications, and, as Constantinople and St. Petersburg are distant fom Pars, the Plenipotentiaries remain still bound by their obligation of silence for two or three weeks to cnme. The so-much-discussed treaty of peace, then, is signedat last,and signedonthe anniversary of a great event. On this day 42 yearsago was fought the battle of Paris, the last. act of the great drama of which urope was the theatre; and -on the following day the Russians entered the capital, and dictated terms of. peace where now their Ambassadors have come toaskforit. Onthefollowing day, which many stil remember as cold, sombre, and cheerless, the allies entered Paris. That France is now able, in concert with her allies, to dictate peace to Russia may be considered as full satisfaction for the past, and I am not quite sure that it was without design that the 30th of March was selected for the occsion. Orders have been sent to the transport scauadron at Toulon to be ready to proceed to the Black Sea to bring home the troops, At the review, which is to be held on Thesday, places will be reserved for such of the diplomatic corps as do not wish to follow the Emperor onhorse. back. I alluded some time since to an idea long familiar to-the Emperor, of a Congress in Paris on the general state of Euxope, with a view to certain modifications. The real object, perhaps, is to efface in some measure the Congress of Vienna. -I believe it has been communicated to the English Government, but has been coldly received. The Emperofs tenacity in such matters is well known, and, though the plan may be postponed, I donbt whether it is entirely abandoned. Another Congress is spoken of -with another object, but on this I must-not.say anything at present; all 'will come in good time. I mentioned in a recent letter that aonnng other facs reported to me relative to the proceedng,s of the Con&>-ess, a clanse favoiirable to Sardinia wa s, or woul ble, In<ted in the protocols. This clause, if I may credit my lpntvant, has reference to the commercial interexts of pfe&ni)1V in conne' on wicih theIDanube. Count Cavouris sald eoiii,vo Sp¶ ,j in an auimated and forcible address th6 t'r- of his Government to participate in the adi e accruing from the throwing open the months SrA freeing the navigation of that river. He d nnnde it is sid, that Sardinian vessels shouid on entering or quitting, on ascending or descending, the Danube suffer no impediments of any kind. -Count Buol is described as havifig offered some opposition to the demand of the Sardinian Government for these immuniities, which -were also supported by the Marquis de Villa Mlarina, the resident Sardiniain Minister in Paris. They were favourably viewed by England and France, and even by Russia, who does not omit any opportunity of showing her resentment to her former friend. Ile conclusion of the discussion was therefore favouraTble to Sardinia. This, I blieve, occuired at the close of the last, or the beginming of the pTe;A week But another and more seriots topic was, I arn told, subsequently brought forward by the Sardinian Plenipotentiary, nmely, the state of Italy. 3X. Cavour drew the attention of the Cbrngressto the present condition of that country. He entered into details, dwelt on the danger of leaving scimportant a qrestion undecided, and declared that the Congress ougbt not to separate without coming to some decision on the question. Count Buol expressed his surprise tlbt a-uh a subject houldbebroughtbeforePlenipotentiries assembled. in congress on the Eastern, and not on the Italian question, andmaintainedthat it was motwithin their functions. Count Cavour disputed that onion -; he denied that the question was less Italiait thars EurbO pean, and maintained that,as they were the et on matters relating to the general interest and weLfare of Eu7rope at large, Italy wras a perfectly legtimate subject for their consideration. He decrda that, if something were not now don1e, another Cimgres would have to assemble soon agai. Count Buo1 disputed the right of Count Cavour to speak in the name of Italy; he (Count Cavour) was in Paris simply as the PleniDotentiary of the Piedmontese Government, and he had no authority to speak in the name of the Pope, the King of Naples, or the Grand Duke of Tascany. Count Cavour repled, that he was there as an Italisn and that his right to speak for Italy was not ess than that assumed by Count Bnol, who spoke broughout in the name of Germany, whereas Auisria was but a single member of the Confederation. Count Buioldenied the analogy sought to be established between the two countries; the States of Italy had no resemlAance to the Germanic Confederation; Austria was the 3nost important member of that Confederation-as such she presided at the Diet, and therefore wherever Germanic interests were discussed the Plenipotentiary of Austria was perfectly entitled, v,here no other Germanic representative was present, to speak in the name of the whole; but such was not' the case with Sardinia. With respect to the oCCupation of part of Italy by foreign troops, which, he presumed, was one of the grievances it hardly became the Congress to discuss that point, seeing thap one of the first effects of- the resolution adopted by the Congress would be the occupation of part of the Sultan's doniinions by 1rench, Einglish, and, if need1 be, by Sardinian troops. He again questioned the propriety of introducing a topic with which in no wise the present Congress hid anythgin to do. Count Cavour said that the object for which the allied troops were' to occupy the Sultan's dominions was very different from the occupation of Italy by. foreign troops. The allies had made war in defence of the independence and integrity of Turkey, that independence and integrity having been endangered by Russia. The situation of Turkey as it was, and the peculiar condition of the subjects of the Sultan, -were among the causes of that danger. The obligation imposed on the allies was to protect the Porte not merely from immediate but from future peril, and the way to do so was by the removal of the causes which led to it. The allies were not bnly bound to aid Turkey in her resistance to Russia, but also to aid her in preventing the recurrence of aggression. This prevention was by means of the reforms in the internal administration of the country, which the Ottoman Government had resolved on adopting; and the occupation of Turkey by the troops of the :Powers in alliance with her vwas only with the view of enabVing the Sultan to varry out those reforms. The Italian occupation was for a different object; it was for the protection of Governments who refused to introduce any reforms. M. Cavour also denied that the introduction of the Italiau question was inopportune, or that it took the Congress by surprise. The observations -which, he contended, he had a right to make, were notning more than the development of amemorandum which had been drawn up by the Sardinian Government, at the request of the Emperor Napoleon, and presented to His Majesty. He made somefurther observations in the same sense, and again entreated the Congress to take the question into consideration, as, if they did not, he feared that before two years passed' away the Italian question would force itself on the attention of Europe. The proceedings of the Congress have been generally kept so carefully secretthatno one, will be espected to vouch for any statement of what passed. Nevertheless, my information comes from so respectable a source that I think I may. venture to say, that if not the exact words spoken by the parties, something of the kdnd took place, and I believe that, at all events, the substance of thle report is correct. I cannot say whether the discussion on Italy will be found to occupy a place in the minutes of the sittings. It is said, that the animated conversation which took place on the admission of the Prussian plenipotentiaries on Saturday, and which occasioned so unpleasant an interruption to the conferences, will, by common consent, be also omitted. No resolution probably has been oome to by the Congress on the question brought forward'by Count Cavour, and I am unable to say whether it will be one of those which still remain to be settled by the Plenipotentiaries after the signing of the treaty of peace. The memorandum said to have been alluded to by Count Cavour was asked by the Emperor from the King of Sardinia the day before the departure of the latter from Paris on his return to his own States, and it wvas the result of several conversations between the two Sovereigns on, the affihirs of Italy. THE PROCLAMATION OF PEACE.. The Lord Mayor yesterday morning, at a few minutes before 10, attended by Sheriffis Rose aun Kennedy, the Sword-bearer, Mace-bearer, and City Marshal, proceeded to the stone balcony in front o£ the .Mansion-house, -where a raised dais had bben erected, covered, with crimson cloth, whence his Lordship read the following despatch:- 'Home-office, 3arch 31, 1856. "My Lord,-I have the honour to acquaint your Lordship that a despatch has been this morning received from the Earl of Clarendon, Her 2tIajetys Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, -dated Paris, the 30th, announcing that a definitive treaty for the 'restoration of peace, and for the maintenance of the integrity and independence of the Ottoman empire, was yesterday signed at Paris by the Plenipotentiaries of Her Majesty, of the Emperor of the French, of the King-ot Sardinia, and of the Sultan, and also of the Emperor of Austria and of the King of Prussia on the one part, and of the Emperor of all the Russias on the other. I have tihe honour to be, my Lord, YourLordshi*' mnost obedient, humble servant, "G. GREY. "The Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, &c." An immense concourse of persons had assembled in front of the MIanLsion-house to hear this despatch read, after which there was a general huxzah andc waving of hatt and handkerchiefs. Precisely at 12 o'clock the civic functionaries, preceded by the Lord Mayor, left the Mansion-house, and proceeded on foot to the Royal Exchange, whence, amid much enthusiasm and. loyalty, his Lordship read the despatch.' The roofs and windows of all the houses intheimmediate neighbourhood of the Royal Exchange were crowded, the greater part by ladies, who evinced lively interest in the proceedings. Standards and union-jacks were floating from most of the public and Gover ment buildings, as also on the mastheads of the ships in the river. As soon as the official proclaumtion had een made at the Royal Exchange aid G;u,ldhalljjge -guna were fired at the Tower.
FORBEIGN ITBLLIGBNcE. PRUSSIA (PiOX OUR OWN COoESONIz.1 [. portion of the foUowing apeaped in our 300ond edition Of YeGUdxF.-- ]3ERLIN, MsARc 29. In the Herrenhaus yesterday an application was tead by the President, emanating from the headquarters of the Third Corps d'Arm6e (Berlin), for the permisrion of the House to the militry authorities' to enter upon the trial of two of its members, Herr Von Rochow and Herr Von der Marwitz (as umpire),, for their paricipation in the late Hinek-eldey duel. The preliminary investigation has been finished, and, as we should say, a " true bill has been found against" the parties concerned; the usaal process of law will now taXe its course. The punishment affixed by the penal code of Prussia to the survivor of a duel which has ended fatally to one of the parties is imprisonment in a fortress for a term varying from two to 12 years. Hinckeldey's second, Herr on MIunchausen, has been suspended from his functions in the Ministry of the Interior. In yesterday's sitting of the House of Deputies a statenment was made by one of the members, President of the Chamber of Commerce in Brealzu, that he had been subjected to a domiciliary visit from the police; he was unwilling to moot the question for the present as to whether it was competent to the police to search the dwelling of a deputy without first obtaining the consent of -the House, nor did he propose himself to make any motion on the subject, or wish any other member to -do so, his great desire being that he should be put on his trial as to whether any sufficient grounds existed for the steps taken against him. This affair, so obscurely alluded to in the House, refers to an unsuccessful attempt made by the police to ascertain who it was that circulated the anonymous paper containing Seiffart's defence, as regards his complicity in the Potsdam theft of papers, together with the insinuations appended to it, and levelled at Baron Von Manteuffel. The document itself wvas anonymous, and without printer's name and address. The nature of it's contents led the police to the conclusion that it had been printed in some place beyond the reach of the Pros.sian laws. Hamburg, Brunswick, and Leipsic were *the places first suspected by the police. A compari-. -son of the type used in the newspapers and literary M orks published at these places w;ith the types used in this document led to the suspicion being fixed upon Brunswick. That suspicion was strengthened by inquiries made by a police agent on the spot. A -rough computation of the number of copies distributed here having been made by the inquiries of the police, the size of the packages containing them was easy of estimate. The probable size and weight of the packet, the place where it came from, and the time about when it nmust have reached here formed the data on which the police proceeded to search the books of the goods department of the railway that passes through Brunswick. This led to the discovery of a parcel answering to the assumeed data of the police having been delivered to a tradesman in this town about the time suspected; an official inquiry addressed to this person led to the admission that this parcel had been delivered to Herr Molinari, the member for Breslau. The domiciliary visit to his dwelling 'showed, however, no traces of any such document having been there. I mention the above as an illustration of the manner in which the Prussian detective police go to work. They had other grounds than those mentioned above for not thinking it improbable that the abovementioned gentleman had been concerned in the affair; and the fact of nothing incriminatory having been found at his dwelling does not necessarily show them to have been incorrect. In addition to the above domiciliary visit the correspondent of a German newspaper has had his lodgings searched, and another, or the same individual, has been put into prison for making "C false cornmunications" on the subject to the paper on which he is employed. The general subject of the police, or rather its great increase of power and functions of late years, -together with the sums expended by the Government on the press, were forced upon the notice -of the House at the same- sitting, by a Liberal member named Harcort, who pointed out that the item of Secret Service Money in the budget of -the Milnistry of the Interior had risen of late years from 40,000 thalers to exactly double that sum ; he averred that the whole country was now covered with a net of espionage, and pointed out more particularly the attempts made to " pervert" -public opinion by forcing certain men as editors upon various papers. (The Government is in secret accused of having in various instances persecuted journals by repeated confiscations up to the point of their getting rid of their editors and takingr on nominees of. the Government, -who 'would, of course, conduct the paper in a sense favourable, or, at the most, not inimical to the Government.) It must be admitted that the institution of police has been brought to a great degree of perfection here by the late Herr Von Hinckeldey; but, asthe overwhelmingmajority of the population consists of honest people, the innumerable measures taken for the control of the very small minority, the rogues, are found to be -eryirksome. Takle the following as an illustration :-Any Prlssian desirous of visiting any place bevond his usual place of residence must have the permission of the police authorities to do so, and the police official in whose more immediate district he resides must give him a certificate that he knows of no reason why the superior office should not issue a passport to him. That was formerly enough; but within the last few weeks fresh orders have been issued, requiring every married man who wants to leave home to bring 'with him to the police-office the certificate of his wife's having no objection to his doing so, a measure evidently directed against the millesimal portion of the population which is in the habit of deserting wife and family. Not only are policemen stationed to inspect all the passengers who arrive at Berlin, and require their passports, but there are also policemen placed at the paying offices of the railways to require men's passports for examination before they can be allowed to start with the train. In the case of foreigners staying here theirpassports are always deposited at the central police oflice, and any creditor having an unsatisfied demand upon them may lodge a detainer against the passports, and so prevent the parties leaving. The intention is to protect the home tradesman from the malpractices of the travelling swindler; but the result in praqtice is to put the honest traveller into the clutchesz of the resident cheat; the tailor Unter-den-Linden sends you in a rubbishing coat at an exorbitant price, and lays an embargo on your passport tiUl you. pay it.- - The inhabitants of Hamburg have been greatly scandalized and vbxed by the attempts lately made by the paper called the Hainburger CorreMoiident, in connexion with the late exposA in London, to defend or palliate the system of prostitution that exists in that town under the cognizance, and it may almost be said the patronage, of the civic authorities. To the latter the apology in question is attributed. One of the most fruitful sources of civic revenue in Hamburg is the tax on prostitution, paid by the wretched women themselves or the imloresarii who speculate on their attractions; and thus it comes that neither the constantly increasing immoralitv of the town nor any "pressure fromn ithogt" avails to procure any reform. The only source of revenue more fertile than the above is the Thorsperre,-a toll levied on al persons fromHamburgtoAltona, or vice verset, after a fixed hour of t}.e evening. As the two towns or territories abut on each other as closely and inti- mately as Fleet-street does on the Strand the nuisance of this imposition may be easily conceived. To-night there is to be an equestrian entertainment ofiered to the - King and Court by the Master of the Horse and the whole versannel attached to the Royal stud in the Royal Mews. On the present cccasion the costumes will be taken from the. time of Frederick the Great; Ziethen's Hussars and Seidlitz' Cuirassiers will perform the usual evolutions of a carratsel, while Grenadiers of that time vwil mount a guard of honour at the portals. AUSTRIA. (FROMr OUR OWN CORBESPONDsTT.) VIENNA, KBLuRu 27. A semi-official article in the Wieter Zeih;)ng of -this morning fully confirms information recently received from me relative to the Synod wlich is to meet in this city in the course of next month. The Austrian publie is told that there can be no question of a conufict between Chuxrch and State, The assembly of bishops will not have the character of a 44 National Council," and the Cardinal Pronuncio Viale Pr7elA will of course preside over it, as it will be jj ditytq ,t 1QWmuncate to tlhe churchl diguitariel the intentions and wishes of His Holiness the Pope. " However," continues the Wiener Zeitung, "there are various matters oni which the bishops will ba required to give information and explanatioii -to the Imp,erial Government, and it jhas been arranged betw,veen the Papal Chair and His MI:ajesty that whenever such is'tho case their Emin-eces the Cardinals of Prague,-Gran;amd-Vieina shall preside-over the epiopalassembly."XYousomedays sincelearnedfrom *me that both Church -and State were likely to make concessions, and it is evidesit fromithei foregoincg that they have already -dotie so. --The Pope conivokes the Bishops, and his.represeiitative ope',the assembly, but Austrian subjects are to preside oyer it whenever its members have to discass matters which concern the.Stato as well as'the C£hfrcE.I The Oesterreichische Co'respondenz has received -the following despatch frm Qdessa : "ODESSA, MACii 14. "Unfortunately the ravages- of the hospital-typhwu continue, and many soldiers a4d physicians have been carried off by the disease. Among the,victims are the quarantine physician Arpa and General Engelhardt. The malady is said to commit still greater ravages at Nicholaieff and in the -Gernnan colonies, but the assertion that the southern army loses 1,000-men a-day is perhaps an exaggeration. -The military authorities make great exertions to put an end to the contagion by providing more roomy quarters and removing the hospitals, but their me asures are not attended with any great success. Of 300 sick men who were trans;ported to this place from Oczak-off 20 died on the road, and more than 50 after thIeir arrival." On the 16th Colonel Turr reached Corfu. He was accompanied by an Austrian Guard, who delivered him into the hands of the British authorities. Soon after his arrival the Colonel left for Constantinople. TME MLEDITERRI&NEAN. ("sOM OUR OWN CoREspoXDZrNT.) MARSEITLES, Min.ir 29. Travellers from the East will learn with pleasure that the French Government has commanded that the practice of sending invalid soldiers by the -mail steampackets from Constantinople to Marseilles shall be discontinued. The Sinai, which arrived this morning with the Crimean mails of the 18th and those from Constantinople of the 20th inst., was immediately admitted to pratique. General Vivian and Colonel Wetherall, who arrived here from the East by the Gange on Wednesday last, suffered the inconvenience of being sent with the ship to the quarantine station at the Frioul, in consequence of two of the passengers having fallen ill on the voyage. They were not, however, long detained. When the sick had been conveyed to the hospital and the Gange fumigated all the passengers were permitted to land. Two medical inspectors arrived here from Paris a few days since, with instructions, it is said, to modify the sanitary regulations, if expecient. As all the precautions adopted by the board of health have been approved by the medical inspectors, it is supposed that no further relaxation vill be permitted. Two steamers, which arrived from KRaniesch wvith invalid solcliers within the last few days, were commanded to land the worst cases at the Frioul, and to proceed with the remainder, one to Port Vendres, and the other to Cette. The Minister of MIarine is said to disapprove the transport of invalid soldiers in ships of war, in consequence of the number of seamen who have fallen victims to the Crimean fever, and to recommend that a number of hospital-ships shall be fitted up for bringing home the sick soldiers from the EIast. Fever declared itself among the crew of the Steam corvette Sand, which brought Aali Pasha to MTarseilles. The Sand was placed in quarantine at Totulon, and 40 of her crew died there. The mortality has been so great among the crew of the steam fligate Andromaque, which left Marseilles some time since with stores for the army in the Crimea, that it was found necessary to send a number of fresh hands from Toulon to join her at Messina. Scarcely any of the British steamers chartered by the French Government arive here with invalids from the Crimea, without having more or less of their crews sick of fever. The sailing transport Kossuth, which arrived from Kaamiesch some days since, was forced to land six of her crew at the Quarantine hospital in the Frioul. Fortunately the disesse h-is not spread much in the town, and altogether the sanitary condition of the place is better than it was. Troops for foreign service are again beginning to arrive at Marseilles. A detachment of the Gendarmerie of the Imperial Guard and a company of the 71st Regiment of Infantry aived yesterday. The captains of the few steamers in the port of the Joliette, chartered by the French Government, have received orders to prepare to embark troops for Algeria. There are few towns in France in which so many local improvements are beiing carried into execution as Mlarseilles. Anong the public buildings in process of construction I may mention an Imperial palace in honour of Louis Napoleon, a cathedral, and an exchange. A new boulevard is being opened in front of the port of the Joliette, which will comniand a fine view of the Mfediterranean, and wvill be from its extent and position one of the most splendid promenades in France. It is further contemplated to construct a gigantic breakwater, on theplan of that at Cherbourg, for the protection of the port and ship; ping at Marseilles against an enemy's fleet. The corn-market has been particularly quiet this keek. Purchasers are few, and holders of grai are unwilling to reduce their prices. A letter from Toudon, dated this morning, announces that the captains of the ships of war in that port h1ave received orders to hold themselves in readiness to sail at a moment's notice. THE BALTIC. We read in the I-zJpiedaiwce Belqe, under date Hamburg, 26th inst.:- "The English vanguard squadron, commanded by Commander Watson, consists at present of four corvettes of 6 guns each; four frigates, two of 51 guns, one of 34, and the other of 21; and two liners, the Caesar, of 91 guns, and the Majestic, of 81,-in all, 10 steamships. The officers of the squadron, who Nisited Hamburg during its stay at idel, stated that it would soon be joined by 10 other ships from England. After the junction of the latter the squadron is to assume the name of ' fleet 'of observation,' and a Rear-Admiral is to be sent to command it. The navi gation in the Baltic is still extremely dangerous. The Eng. lish squadron, which, after meeting at the island -f Moen, had taken advantage of a few spring days to procoed to the coast of Courland, -vas obligid by the retarxif of frost to 'withdraw and steer for its former station at Farosund, near the island of Gothland. - Tho comununication between the coasts of Sweden and Finland, in the Gulf of Bothnia, continues to take place on the ice. The Gulf of Pinl,nd has also become unna-vigable for the last.-10 days. VeEsels cannot reach the port of Boldera3, and maritime transactions are completely suspended at Riga. This state of things may last, in consequence .of the severityof the frost, until the close of April after which it will require at least a fortnight for the uce to disappear altogether-in the two gulfs. During that peri6dthonavigation is sodangerous that no vessel ventures to put to sea. It maiy consequently be exr,ected that the English squadron will quietly reiain at Farosund until all danger is. over. I informed you, in ono of my last letters, that Count Kielmnnnsegge had been elected by the inhabitants of the German duchy of Lmuenburg member of the Supreme Council sitting attCopenhagen, inthe room of Count do Reventlow- Criminil, former Minister, who declined accepting that mission. I have heard to. day that 31. Kielmannsegge has followed the example of his predecessor. In the present state of public opinion it wil - be extremely difficult, if not impossible, tofLnd in the duchy a man of some political weightwho wil consent to represent the country in tho Grand Council of the MIonarchy." SARDINIA. (mROM OUIROVN- consRSroNnsDN.) TURIN, 3IARLc 27. In a few days Count Cavour is expected to return from his important mission as representative of this. country at the Paris Conferences. That he vwill bring back with him suclI tidings as his fellowcitizens had hoped for seems more than doubtfil.; but that if he fails to do so it will not be his fault I believe no one questions. At the same time, it is pretty certain that the stability of- his Government will be seriously affected should he return emptyhanded, as in such case he would have to encounter again the united attacks of those parties which coalesced to oppose the treaty of alliance, and rhich wiUh:ve gained streng,th since . then, if it appears that theirdenunciation of the war policy was wrell founded. The cause of this is evident enough. On the discussion of the treaty one of the strongest inducements brought forward by the supporters of tho measure was that the fact of Sardinia entering into a close alliance with France and England would be for the welfare of Italy, and there was good reason to believe that the Government itself received such assurances at the time from those Governmentsa-with which it was about to join its fortunes in the war as gave much additional force to this argument. Now, when Italians talk of tho welfare of Italy they generally understand, intlhe first place, " independence," which is the one sentiment common to.all, high above every othei,.and free from all ia,ll egotisms; and what they mean by "independence" is the emaicipation of 'their coimtnty froni foreign interventiona aind 'foreiga: 6ccupation; ,id, it is worthy, -of observation that whenever they have exhibited what may. perhaps have been considered 'vacillation in the choice of their le'adbrstheyhave ifever'swerved frnom this fixed idea 'and that when they worihibped Pttius -IX. a's a demigod, 'or ~mAde a.hero: of' Charles Albert; or reverenced NIaz-M zini as a prophet;it was that they believed each at 'the moment -to be the. person most. fitted to . work out their deliverance.Q.On the'question of independence it may safelybe said that Italians are nanimoua-on that alone, unforhuiately; 'and therefore it is not dificult to foresee that if Sardiniashall not have obtained sone concessions on this point by her sacrifices in taking the field, not only will the whole policy of M. Cavour'sGovernent' ,be exposed to very' strong, anid possibly successful opposition in Parliai;aent - here, but the influence which Sardinia had gained throughout Italy at the expense of the Republican party will reccive a severe check So lpng as- there was a prospect of .the Sardinian Government gaining by its alLiances a relief for them from the evil of foreign intervention. all Italy was constitutional, and the Republicans were completely 'powerless; but there is too much reason to fear a disappointment of those hopes now would soon revive the almost extinct embers of that-.party whose whole theory ofI sulccess is founded on revolution. We have lately seen crimes of startling audacity comniitted in. Parma, and 'which .the friends of despotism ascriDe to Republican plots, and Austrian military authorities forthlwith.step in (uninvited, perchance) to counsel the old remedies of martial law and wholesale arrests. The whole of Central Italy is unusually excited just now, aid it may be that the Governments there seriously apprehend a repetition of the scenes of '48; but after seven years of restoration they find themselves as helpless as before, and their only hope of salvationis'in foreign aid. Every one acnmowledges that if the armies of occupation were withdraWu from the Papal States the Government, as at present constituted, could not last 24 hours, which, is the natural consequence of the memorandum of the five Powers to the Papal Court on this subject in 1831 having been treated with contempt. It would be -ridiculous to say, therefore, that these Governmentsrequire time to make arrangements before it would be possible to withdraw the foreign armies, since delay has onldy served to confirm them in old habits. The real merit of the question of the pacification of Italy lies between the principles of Austrian or Sardinian'influence, the former of which means constant ill-feeling between Goverunents and people, because it necessitates foreign intervention, and the latter selfgovernmnent, because it vould maintain independence. It may be added that these views are not confined to this part of the Peninsula alone, but are common from n;orth to south.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Sir Baldwin Walker having this day called my attention to statements made by me relative to the attacl; on Acre being at variance with questions he had been asked, I have looked over the different reports of my speech in reply, and Ifind in The Timzes I am represented to have said, that I led tVie storming party and succeeded in capturing the place. I beg to say that is quite a mistake-Acre was neve 'r stormed. My speech is corroctly reported in the Morning Advcrtiser, where there is not a word about storming. Sidon was stormed, wlhich probably caused the mistake. I remain Your obedient servant. CHARLES NAPIER. Albemarle-street, March 31.

EXECUTINY FOR MURDBR. One of thoe dreidful spectacles,' happily iiow of rare .occurrence, a publio execition, took plac e erday morn ing in the met;opol ,Jin_Te fsontrpt the gaol of lNewgate. ' .The culpritaS' Williaim 'Bousfield, -Ed lx&was convicted at the d=ar. session of .the -Ce'ntra3i C 6AI ii 'ourt of mu±deli4g his wife iiinamno4t hoftiblo 3ianer;, bycauttingher tbroat and wuindiQ1g hei i'ster' other pa*s of'the body with a chisel; there b:Wig :dso -threef other indictments against hind, for muidering, ils three children at tbe same time, and .withAthi same .inStmieiint.` The. dreadful acts appeared to have been' commnittedvwithout' any motive that was apparent, and the wretched nhfa, after hiving' destroyed his wife anud children, went sSraight 'to the' police station ini Bow-street and aiowed the fact,' and delivered himselfup tothe police. .Tho learned: counsel who, defended him at the trial (Mr. Ballantine) admitted that he was entirely helpless as to a defence, except that the enorinity Qf the criime was in itself a proof that LL3'-prisoner could not have been in his right senses when he cominitted it, and, - the jUir laving at -ollC^ rettirned a -verdict of guilty, the law was left to take its course. Almost from the moment 'of his being committed for trial the prisoner has exhibited a peculiarly sullen and taci. turn demeanour; he has' evaded every attempt to obtain a clue to the caihses that. coild.have induced him' to commit such atrocious crinies'; -and, although the Rev. Mr. Davis, the Ordinary of the gaol> has paid hind unremitting attendance, and has frequently conjured him not to leave- the world without- giving some explanation upon the subject, it has been of no avail. Upon some occa. sions he appeared as though he was about to make a confession, but after 'saying a few words he would suddenly appear to check himself, and not a syllable more would escape his lips. i Enough, however, has transpired to make it appear that jealousy was the primlary cause of the dreadful tragedy, and -in a letter written by the prisoner to his father he accused his wife of having committed adultery; and it appears that one of the unhappy children who died by his hand had informed him, a few days before the fatal occurrence, that she had seen a young man who was in the habit of frequenting the cigar shop kept by his wifekiss her; and this, it wouldappear, greatlyinfuriat6dthe prisoner, andvery probably led to the fatal result. It was veryovident for sometime that the prisoner entertained strong hopes that his life would be spared, and he appeared desirous to impress the authorities of the prison by his conduct that his mind was affected. Hs proceedings in this respect were, however, of so clumsy a character that the deception was immediately detected, and upon his being remonstrated with, and reminded that such a course could not by any possibility benefit him, he at once desisted. The Ordinary was constantly engaged in reading to and conversing with tho unhappy man, in the hope that he might be brought to a proper sense of his awful position; but it would appear that hisexhortationsw ere attendedwith very little effect. On Saturday the prisoner made a most desperate attempt at self-destruction. The public is aware that the " condemned cell," which was formerly the recep. tacle for prisoners condemned to death during the short period then allowed by the law after sentence, is no longer made use of; but the prisoner is placed in a 'sufficiently comfortable room, with a good fire, and watched night and day by one of the officers of the gaoL It appears that on Saturday afternoon the prisoner was visited by two of his sisters. They were very much distressed, as may be conceived, but the prisoner exhibited a a good deal of indifference, and very little passed at the interview. After his sisters had left him Bousfield was seated upon the edge of his bed, which is close to the fireplace, the officer being quite neai him, when he suddenly started from his seat and threw himself head-foremost upon the grate. The officer immediately rashed upon him and dragged hin from his perilous position, and with assist ance his clothes, which were on fire, were pulled from him, and he thus escaped without receiving material injury. The prisoner, however, had a good deal of hair under his 'chin, and this had ignited, and the moutn and lower parts of the face were severely burnt. Mr. Gibson, the surgeon of the gaol, was at once sent for, and he found that all that could be done was to apply cooling lotions to the face to relieve the pain, and these were continued almost constantly during the remaining period of the wretched man's existence. It appears that from this time the prisoner refiLsed to take any sustenance, and the only nutriment he received from Saturday afternoon to the time appointed for his ececutionwas a smaU quantity of millk,which was almost forcibly administered to himn with a spoon. It is due to the Sherifsi, Messrs. Kennedy and Rose, to state that they have taken a most painful interest in the unhappy man, and have granted every proper facility for representations to be made in the proper quarter, with a view that if any facts existed that vwould justfy a commutation of the sentence they should be made known. The Sheriffs or their deputies, Messrs. J. A. Rose and Stone, have seen him almost every day since he has been in the gaol, and have joined their exhortations to those of the Or dinary to bring the wretched prisoner to a proper sense of his condition;. but, although he' appeared grateful for their kindness, their attentions did not appear to be attended with any success,- and the -prisoner to the last remained dogged and silent, and refused all explanation upon the subject of his crimes. So early as 6 o'clock yesterday morning Mr. Sheriff Rose, accompanied by his brother and deputy, Mr. J. A. Rose, was in attendance, and Mr. Sheriff Kennedy and Mr. Under-Sheriff Stone shortly afterwards arrived at the gaol. The Rev. Mr. Davis had been' with the wretched man from an early hour, but all his endeavours to induce him to receive the consolations of religion were ineffectual. He appeared, indeed, in an almost totally prostrate conditibn, and Mr. Weatherhead, the newly-appointed governor of Newgate, directed that some wine should be: given to'him. When the authorities whose painful duty it was to superintend the execution were admitted to the-room where the wretched 'man was confined he was found sitting on .a 'sort "of couch that' formed. his bed, with his *head buried in his breast, and apparently' utterly urpconscious of what was passing around him. Calcraft,' the executioner, it once proceeded to pinidon the culprit, and when this -aid been completed the prisoner --vomited for a considerable time, and the' whole of his physical strength .appeared to have left him. There canbe no doubt, however, from: what subsequently occurred, that -i good deal of this apparent'weakness was assumed, in the hope 'possibly that somie of the usual precautions would be neglected, and that he might thus be enabled 'to carry out the plan he had evideitly contemplated of creating a scene ofi the scaffold. Fortunately, however, notwithstanding the; aipparently' prostrate condition of the prisoner, he was securely pinioned, and his subsequent desperate proceedings. bn the scaffold rly 'had the effect of increasing his own sufferings. 'When tho process of pinioning had been completed the prisoner let his head drop on' his breast,' and appeared. to have ailready felt' the pang bf death. Eight- o'clock,. the hour. appointed for the execution,- having arrived, the prisoner was raised by four men, and in thaitmanner conveyed to the, scaffold., As' _h appparedlofil4 unable to stand, it was ic nirdefdtlie'beit-dourse to place him ia chair 'under tho-'beani; and he wa' sustained in that 'position by one of 'the assistaints wvhile Calcraft' fixed the rope in its- proper 'positiofi. The P.ev. Ar.Davis-aecompaniied the wretched man; but, from his apparent state, it, -appeared useless to perform -the usual-' ofices"of ireligion. When the, ignal was-given the chair on'wlici the *rechXed' man'was still seated'of 'coursoe gavo way vith the drop, adid' consequentlythe fall was not nearly so great as it -is undtr, ordinary circumstances; -andat thisdreadful monfentthepri-' soner attempted to carry out -the desperate struggle for life which hehad evidentlycontemplated. The soundof the falling; drop had scarcely passed away when there was a shriek from the crowcd of " He is np again !" and, to the horror gf every one, it was found. that the prisoner by a,powerful: muscular effort.-had drawn Ihimself up completely 'to. thelevel of the drop, that both his feet were restirlg upon' the edge of it, and he was vainly endeavouring to raise'his, hands to the rope. One of the officers immediately rushed' uponthe seaffold, and pushed the vretched mn's feet fsom t'ieir hold, but im- an instant, by a' violent effbrt,:he threw himself to the other side, and again succeeded in getting both his feet on the edge of the drop. - Calgraft, wiio had left the scaffold, imagining: that all! was over, w.s calledback; he seized the wretched crimainal, but it'was with considerable di'd'iculty that he forced him from the scaff'old, and he was againsuspended.' The short relief thewretched man, had' obtained fromi the pressure .of the rope 'by these desperate efiorts had,rprobably enabled him to respire, and, to the astonishment and horror of all the spectators, he a- third timeesucceeded in placinghis feet upon the platfim,. and again his hands vainly attenmpted' to reach the fatal cord. Caleraft and two or three other nienthen agai forced' the wretched man's feet fromii their hold, and his. legs -were, held down until 'the final strnggle was over. While this fearful scene was beinlg enacted the bells of the different neighbouring churches were ringing merrily iupon' the 'announcement -of perce, ofl'ering sad contrast to the melancholy proceeding. - - ' At 'J'cloC;the body o£ the prisoner was cut dovn andplaced i a nshell, and in'the evening' it was buried -in; the gaol, pursuant to the terms of.- the- senten e.

In consequence of the instructions issued from the Horse Guards great exertions are being made by the military authorities at Chatham to have the whole of the infantry stationed at that garrison instructed in the theory and-praciice of the Enfield rifle. The whole of the non-conmissioned officers and'men belonging to the depot of the 5th Northunaberland Fusileers, under the command of Captain W' Lyons, have completed their course of instruction in the rifle practice, and are ready to oe draughted to variougs stations for the purpose of instrueting the troops. Yesterday Colonel Jervis, commandant of the Provisional Battalion, selected 84 non-commissioned officers and men from the various depOts at the Provisional Battalion to be instructed in the use of the Enfield rifle. The following were the depots which furnished men for this duty-vir., the 35th, 40th, and 52d Light Infantry; 75th, S3d, and 87th Roya Irish Fasileers. The whole of the above are relieved from the ordinary garrison duty and placed under thesuperintendence of Captain W.

Justice Torrens, announced in the Eecond edition of Vi^e Times of Monday, took place on Saturday last at Derrynoid-lodge, in t-he county of Londonderry. The deceased, who was S1 years of age, was called to the bar in 1798, and held the office of sesjeant for many years. He was elevated to the bench in 1823.
CO E.MVT9-ARDEN THEATRE. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am obliged to ask you to insert this reply to £r. Gye's letter in your impression of to-day, as that gentleman's remarks on -what I said on the 15th inst. at the meet*ing of renters are so unaccountably incorrect that I am bound to notice theni. Mr. Gye became tenant of Coventgarden Theatre in 1851, paving as a rental one-seventh of the gras receipts; and Mr. Xobertson was appointed the joint treasurer of the proprietois and Mr. Gye. This continued for three years, when, upon the ground that by this ar-sangement the proprietors saw too much into the secrets of Mr. Gye's management, an agreement was entered into, dated the 12th of July, 1854, under w.bich Mr. Gye became tenant for ten years, from the lst of October, 1854, deter. minable annuallv at his option, at a rent for the firast three - years of 6,5001. per annum, and for the other seven years at 7,0001. per annum. *By the annual account rendered to the proprietors by their treasurer on the 18th of August, 1855, the following sunms w ere then due and owing by MIr.

Mr (lye savs, "'Since I hav-e been lessee (five years) msy rent has amnunted to above 34,000!. ;" and, of course, he means the public to understand he has paid above 54, 000!. In reply, I can only say our tzeasurez's accounts show a aum paid under 30,000Z. (less than 6,000Z. per annum).

Mtr. eye had nevier said the 2001, ws an error, only that he did not think the 3347. 6s. 4d. arrears was so much, not remembering, I suppose, that the figures were those of his ow,n treasurer. When MIr. Gvye wrote that he only owed 200?. on the 31st of December he 7-new that the acceptance of C. for 4401. was not paid, and that it was doubtful wihether it wrould be, and, ashe used my statement to show this 2(00l., in common fairness he should have used the w;hole, and not a portion of it. Again, Mr (lye says,--"The present quarter a sum of 1,5001. had bec ome due, the greater part of whichwvould have been paid had nxot the fire occurred." This Mr. (lye both by his agreement anld my account wams bound to know is not correct. The 1,500?l was the halanco of rent for the season 1855, and Mr. (lye wvas to ha.ve paid 800!. of it from MIr. Anderson's receipts, and the balance he w as to have paid by wreekly inetalments o' 50?. each when the opera season commenced. Mr. Gye now owres the propnetors thiis 1,708!. 5s. 4d., also 750!. reserved for season 1854, and 152Z. 5s. 4d. arrears to be received. 3Ir. (lye also owies the rent from the 1st of October to the present time; and, as h{r. (lye, in his letter, soggests to Mr. Anderson how to pay 400!., solI would take the liberty of suggesting to hir. (lye howv to pay the proprietors their rent--vi, by an order upon the insurance company. I must apologie for so long an explanation, but I hope I have made it clear beyond a doubt that wvhen, on the 15th of Miarch, I asserted that Mr. (lye owed for rent 1,700?. I only asserted what was the fact. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. HARRY SURMAX. lincoln's-inn, March 31.
THE ROBBEBY BY THE ORDAIANCE CILFRK AT PORTSarovris.-George Joseph LTathaniel Charlier, whose ab-sconding from Portsmouth on Friday last with 1,1301. of the Government moneys was fully detailed in The Times of yesterday, was placed in the dock of the Portsmouth policecourt, before Mr. G. C. Stigant, the Mayor, and other magistrates, yesterday noon, to answer to the charge. The woman who was the coinpanion of his flight (who is well known at the gaol and to the police as Elizabeth Jones, and who was caqtured in his company) was placed in the dock wvith him. The male prisoner was admirably " got up" as a middle-aged widow, in weeds, and, having a cadaverous thin face, passed well for one who might have been supposed to have lost " the prop that did sustain her house." His apparel was complete, consisting of widow'scap,bomnet, and crape veil, false hair in bands, black alpaca dress, black cloth mantle, lady's boots (he has a remarkably small foot), open-worked stockings, white corded skirt, pocket kerchief with widow's hem, fur boa, axd " spectacles on nose." The evidence given by Mr. Alexander Stewart, Storekeeper of the WarDepartment; Mr. Theakstone, cashier of the Bank of England; Joseph Shepherd, office keeper a. the Gun-wharf; and Mr. Superintendent Leggatt, of the Portsmouth police force, fally confirmed the details given in our yesterday's report. The only addition necessary is relatie to the manner of the detection and capture of the prisoners, which was very dexterously effected by Mr. Leggatt. It appears the Prisoner Charlier and his companion left 'ortsmouth on Friday night by a fly, taking the old turnpike road inland. The first stage they made was Petersfield, where they put up at the Dolphin Hotel, and partook of refreshment. From the DolDhin they posted on to Farnham, whence on Saturday they posted on to Guildford (White Lion Hotel); thence to Esher, and thence to london; and, the driver's horse being knocked up, he put them down somewherein Piccadilly; fromthisspot tovarioushotels nd coffeehouses and packet stations, Mr. Leggattprosecuted his search until he came upon the fugitives at the leopard Coffee-house, at the top of Fenchurch-street,'Aldgate, where hefound themandressedas described, but withoutthe bonnet, and looking out of the window, and the woman very expenLsively attired for a person of her class. Mr. Leggatt announced his name and duty, and took up a black leather bag he saw beside the man, saying, "Is the money here, Mr. Charlier'e' Towhich hereplied, "Theprincipalpart of the gold and silver is there, and here (producng from under his gown a packet) are the whole of the notes. I have not broken them at all." (The numbers of these notes corresponded with those spoken of by MIr. Theakstone as having been paid the prisoner partly in exchange for the check for the public salaries on Friday). Mr. Ieggatt then took him into custody. The moneys recovered amount to 1,10Si. 14s. 6d. In the black bag were the whiskers, &c., mentioned vesterday, and some canvass bank bags, with pieces, where apparently a name may have been cut out of each. Charlier then turned to his companion, and said-" Betsy, rve deceived you ;" and then added, " Mr. I,eggatt, until five minutes since she was not aware but what the moneys I had were my own; I told her I had 1,400L in the bankl of my own, and she said, on mf telling her of it, f You have deceived me, indced; I won t betray you, but I'll not go any further with you."' This Eo far exonerated the female prisoner from the suspicioni of being ,areieep8 criminis that the bench discharged her. Mr. Swainson, the Portsmouth agent to the solicitor for the War Department, prosecuted for the Crown, -aud Mr. Ford appeared for the prisoners; and Charlier was fully cormmatted for trial at the ensuing seaseoasL He preserved an unmoved bearing throughout, and stepped from the dock to: the court table and signed his statement, " I have ndthing tosay," with a firsm step and flourishing stle. Big p- PWazance createi1 much mirth in a large and soi toe select auditozfy in the bsllery, and the case altogether excited inprceedented curiosity, owing to tl prisoner's respectbility i4 hS ar kabk 4iz~,
_--- JPOYAZ JTAPIAH OPERA. Thereis no-longer any hesitation about the temporary home of the Covent Garden compi twhichwas threatened with dissolution bithe lte Sire. Something less- t4tan a month has elapsed since the catastrpphe.' 2uiing'this *eriod a. 'Gye musti havelabonred with energy and-resoluion, smnce hehas managedth retain the services of every one of the artisb he had pr6viuiily engaged, and on conditions modified- to aiit the altered.circumstances under wbicA hiismisfortun' has compelled him 'to address tihe public' The fidelity of the Italian singersand their conductor; i *the midst of so severe a trial, does them credit, andcl wrrafi6 -a doubt as to the justice of thati verdict which 'charges theatrical performers, and foreigneis in England especiallv -with the besetting sin of ingratitude., If it is true, as we hear, that one and all have cheerfully made sacrifices, it will be admitted that they have actedvwell, and that they are entitled to the consideration of their patrons, no less than to the thanks of their director. Nothingnow rentaining to necessitate further delay, the manager of the Royal Italian Opera and the proprietor. of the Lyceum have come to terms. The provisional contract, which Mr. Gye has held for some time past, will be signeid -at once. The workmen to be employed on the requisite preparations and the officials actively connected with the operatic undertaking willto-day formally take possession of the theatre. These indispensable preliminaries could not - have been entered upon before, since, had not Mr. Gye been encountered in aliberal spirit by those upon whose exertions he depended, he was withoutacompany, arnd, in consequence, the Lyceum or any other theatre would have been of no use to him. Great expedition, however, must be used if the house is expected to open on the 15th of April-the day on ,which the subscription is advertised to commence. -But it is not likely that any time will be lost ; and, en attendant, we may briefly survey the pledges for the ensuing campaign, which, though not yet thrown into the convenient and authoritative form of a mianagerial prospectus, are nevertheless sufficiently clear and precise to merit attention. To begin with the company-and, as in duty bound, with the- ladies. Among the soprani we find all the chiefs-of last season-at the head of tlieni Madame Grisi, whom, it would seem, even a conflagration cannot deter from coming once moreto say "Addio" to her old and constant admirers. The other dramatic "first lady" is Madame Jenny Ney, whose debut, in Fidelio, took place on that memorable night vhen the Queen of England conducted her Imperial ally to a theatre more magnificent than any in his own capital. It was not as the Leonora of Beethoven, however, that Madame Ney obtained the undivided favour of the English public, but as Verdi's Leonora, in the successful opera of ni Troratore. Foremost in the rank of prime donne " of s'lity" comes Madame Angiolina Bosio, who from the posie ton of a modest appeUant has gradually worked her way into that of an acknowledged and universal favourite. By her.side is the young and zealous Mademoiselle Marai, a compri7naria (if she will permit us to term her so), equal when called upon to assume the duties of a " prima donna aswoluta," and than whom one more capable and generally serviceable in her station could with difficulty be found. Mademoiselle Nantier Didice, the contralto, a-good actreiss and a clever singer, with Madame Tagliafico, as " confidante" and seconda donna, complete the list. The catalogue of tenors leaves nothing to desire, since, although Signor Tamberlik is only engaged for a short period (lured to Rio Janeiro by the munificence of his Brazilian Majesty), Signors -Mario and Gardoni are to remain for the season, while Signor Luchesi is also at hand to accomplish on emergencies whateverduties may be required of him. The barytones and basses are even stronger than before- Signor Ronconi-whose absence last year deprived the subscri'ers of their much affected Rigoletto, and robbed the Barbiere of more than half its humour and vivacity-is once more at the head of the former; Signor Lablache and Herr Formes of the latter. It will be curious to observe how Lablache can manage to dwarf himself to the exigencies of a stage where even Ronconi ..c once the smallest and the greatest of Figaros, is likely to put on respectable proportions. Signor Tagliafico, that Proteus of Itaian opera; Signor Polonini, a model impersonator of minor characters; Signors Zelger and Luigi Mei; and, last not least, Signor. Soldi, who has been surnamed "the vocfferous," bring up the rear of the male department. Mr. Costa, as we have hinted, reassumes the baton, and may be accepted as guarantee that the band and chorus; however necessarily circumscribed in numbers, will at least be of first-rate quality. As the dimensions of the Lyceum are very difftrent from those of the late theatre in Covent-garden, the operas of Meyerbeer, with their gorgeous and complicated accessories, are out of the question; and this explains why, in the catalogue of works to be performed during the season of 40 nights, there is no mention of R?obert le Diable, the szgyuenots, the Prophete, or the Etoile du NVord. The last, more particularly-which was produced so near the end of the season, 1855, that it can scarcely be said to have begun its London career-will be missed from the repertoire. But there is no alternative. Among 17 operas announced for production (the names of which may be seen in the advertisement) we are glad to find La G=a Ladra and J/ ANatrinionio Seareto. Neither of these has been heard much of late, while both are admirably suited to a small stage. The only novelty is Signor Verdi's last opera but one-La Tra-i2ata-founded on the Dame aoux Canzdias, of M. Dumasftls, and in-which the new singer, Mademoiselle Piccolomini, has won the largest portion of her laurels at Turin and elsewhere. Who is to embody the lady of the Camelias is not specified ; but the 2'raviata will no doubt be welcomed with avidity by the Verdi-loving subscribers, as an agreeable pendant to ligoletUo and n Trovatore. The rest of the promised operas are, without exception, wellknown favourites. That the ballet-or, at any rate, the ballet dive?-tissemnentis not to be neglected may be gathered from the re-engagement of the popular Madame Fanny Cerrito, together with Mademoiselle Esper, AL Desplaces (ballet-master), and a host of satellites. In addition to these, and the operatic arrangements, Mr. Gye has concluded a treatywith Madame Ristori, the celebrated Italian tragedian, who, with the troupe now performing in Paris, will give a series of dramatic representations on the " off-nights." A proposition, moreover, has been accepted by the directors of the Crystal Palace for a certain number of concerts in the summer, at which all the artists, vocal and instrumental, of the Royal Italian Opera will assist. If the comparatiely short season at the theatre in Wellingtonstreet, hacked by these additional speculations-pending the (somewihat problematical) restoration of the ancient building, or the construction of a new opera-house and concert-room at present in contemplation, the site of which balances between Leicester-square and Burlington-gdenscan sustain the fortunes of the Covent-garden estab hment, it will be a matter for congratulation, not so much on account of Mxr. Gye and his company, or of the public satisfaction, as of the many poor and deserving personswho gain their livelihood exclusively through the existence and prosperity of such enterprises.

THE NEW* AfEDICALBILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It would be unreasonable, now that Parlianent is about to re-assemble, to ask you to spare any more space in your columns for the diseussion of lr. Headlam's medics! bill. Indeed, the absurdities of it have been so wel es. posed by your correspondent " S.-T. H.,"-and'the objection which he has made to it-have been left so completely unan. swered by yourother correspondent, the "Draughtsman of the Bill," that there is little more to say on the subject. There is, however, one matter connected with it which I shall be glad if you will allow me to notice in your journaL The " Draughtsman of the Bill " has stated that it "is sup.' ported by the great mass of the medical profession in the kdngdom." Now, it is only necessary to refer to the nameTous letters repudiating the bill to be found in the medical journals in the course of the last few weeks to be satisfied that this statement is completely without foundation. When the bill was first announcedthe mass of the profession fully believed that one object, of it was to protect them against unlicensed practitioners, and hence were disposed to tegard it with some degree of favour. They have now found that they are disappointed in this respect, and their views have changed accordingly. It would have saved the Secretaries of State who have succeeded Sir Jaies Graham (and who Laust have been heartily tired of receiving medical deputations) a world of trouble if they had in the fit instance taken a little more pains to learn the point really at issue. The great majolity of the medical practitioners in EifIand,*whatever they may say'about medical reform, care no'about any legislation which would notinclude certain penal enactments toprevent empirica and unlicenstd praCtitionerS from interfering with tbem in their practice. .hether this, in the abstract5 v ould be right or werong it is needlee!sto consider,' as it is suite plain that such enactments will never be rnade by Parbament5 and that, if they wrere made, *hey would. be a dead -letter.

In the couise of the -eveuaing the 'woman said something-which displeased the prisoner, and he gave her a backhasidedslap onthe mouth, which made ibleeL She cried very much. After sonie timethey became reconciled, and took o&me more drink,'iuntilhe became quitetipsy, nd she was tather drunk. They remiined inthe house ti laclkngup time, and then they went awaytogether,'as tne witnesses stated, quiet and comfortable. They had tak-en five pints of four.penny ale, and were at the publiciouse from 8 ti tearly 12 o'lock. Shortly -after their leaving the publichouse the wife iand another womaia ealled at a shop and purchased some potatoes. She did not then appear to be tipsy, or as if she had had any Deer. She remained about aqiiarter of an hoir, and as she 'was leaving asked for a match,' which she took away with her, She-was met in the street by a woman named Hard. ang She went to her own passae, and then *ent up stairs, and twvice called: "James." - The prisoner had gone home 'befoid her. A man-named Brown and his wife lived in a s6oom adjoining that occupied by the -prisoner and his wife. The partition was so thin thit anything that occurred in. `one roam could be heard in the other. Brown heard the prisoner come up to his room. He said, "'ll ldl -the' 'b------." There was not any-othrperson in the roam. 'Ue afterwards said, "r-ll the-cow " and hethen d,id, "I'll do some mis tief-I'lgoV gand drown myself.' lt 'aboattlOminutes or a quarter of an hour after this BEorn heard the wife comae'up stair Before-she entered -th5 room she said, "Are you imsde, my dear Jem-?" He said, "You - -,- r- -give you something " and - he then appeared to: come out on the landing, and, catch- ing her as though he were pushing her into the room. Brown heard two blows given, and a fall; he heard the Wife-then say, " Oh, Jew, you have killed me, and kldled iny oild; Jem look about, and-see what-you have done." 'The prisoner then ran' t1ownstairs, pard the *oman called out; to Mms Brown to come to her; and she said to '-MmS. BroWn, "1 Jem has killed me." Upon going into the prlsonefs room Brown found the woman lying on the floor, betweei the bed and the fireplace; Blood was about her; she saidlherhusband.had kiled her. The prisonerin the meantimov went and fetched amidwife, and begged her to come quickly, or his vife *ould die before she arrived. Theimidwife accordingly accompanied the prisoner to his room, and there she found the'woman lying on the bed insensible. She diedin about five minutes. The prisoner -looked at his wife, and said, - "You may taXke xe up, and do what you like lwith me." - A policeman was sent for, and -a doctor. hne woman was in a' far -advanced stage of pregnancy, and her lying-ificlothes were in - the room. WMen the prisoner came to the room door-he was very much distressed. He said he did not think he had done so much mischief; he did not mean to do it. He tore hiis clothes, and said, "Take me away, hang me up at once." A policeman caume; he saw the prosonerrunning along the street without his hat or coat. The policeman went4to the prisoner's room, And assisted some women who were there to raise the wife from the floor and- 'put her on the bed. Blood was running from beneath her clothes. -He then took the prisoner, who was standing on the landing, to the police-station. - He subsequently- saw: the prisoncr, and charged him with murderng his wife. The prisoner, who was in a state of excitement, said 'two or three times, " Is she dead, is she gone V The policeman told him she wvas dead Mr. Cox, a surgeon at Bath, was sent for, and he went, in company with htr. Barrett, a surge6r. They found the woman lying on the bed; her clothes were saturated with blood. There was a qnantityof blood on the floor of the room. Upon examination'the - surgeons found the blood proceeded from lacerated wounds on the abdomen; she was then just at the point of death. She gave a 'few feeble gasps, and expired. Having satisfied themselves that she was quite dead, theydelivered h'er'of 'a dead child by the CQesarean operation. She was in'the latst,age of preg. nancy. The child had not been dead' long. If the woman had been delivered before receiving the wounds the child would have been living; it was a healthy child. On the sume day they made a r,ost mortema examination of the body which was in a perfectl healthy state, but quite bloodless, except the right side of the heart. On examining the abdomen they discovered lacerated wounds extending about three incies in length; these lacerations caused the death. They appeared 'to have been done by two acts; they coxjld not have been proluced by a sharp ins'rument. They were done with considerable force; a blow from a foot with a boot might have produced those wounds. If she had fallen upon the edge of a chair which was in-the room the wonids might have been caused, but then the chair must have been tipp up. 'As the blows might have been giren through te clothes, whatever they' were done with vomid not have been marked wvith blood. Mr. Barrett 'was of epnio that a violent kick had 'produced the wounds. A kiclk intended for Behind might have caused the injury. When the prisoner was informeed of the death of his wife, he said " It waS a drop of drink. I meant no hann. I uas trying to kick her upstairs." He appeared rather flushed with drink. He had on old odd boots. Heappeared for the moment unconscious when told of the death of his wife. - Mr. PouwDm; said it was impossible for -him to contend that the result did not proceed from the act of the prisoner, and it was impossible_hat-it could result in any other verdict than that of manslaughter. The learned JUDGE said, addressing the jury, that this was a grave and serious case-a charge that the prisoner had murdered his wife, and it was necessary that they should consider that the prisoner had the intention of killing his wife, or had used a weapon or instrument which was likely to produce bodily harm or death, and the jury would then have to consider whether the prisoner had not been guilty of murder - but it was clear that they could not arrive at the conclusion that the prisoner had deliberately intended to kill his wife. He thought that they would be of opinion that the prisoner was guilty of manslaughter. The jury found the prisoner Gailqu. Sentence deferred. (BAo-re a Specia& .ury.) BENNEr, CLERK, V. THoarPsOa. lMr. SerjeantlKinglake, lr. Smith, and Ir. Coleridge, were counsel for the plaintiff- and Mr. Slade and Hr. Collier for the defendant. The declaration stated that the defendant had built certain chimneys the smoke from which created a nuisance and injured the property of the plainti. The defendant pleaded that he had been possessed of these chimneys for more than 20 yeas. To this there was a new assignment, -alledginz excess. The plaintiff was the Rev. Mr. Bennett, the vicar of Frame, in t-his county, and the defendant was a manufacturer in the same town; his factory adjoined the vicarage. Originally there had been one chimney to this factory, but lately the defendant had added four other chimneys. When the wind was in a particular quarter the smoke was blown into the vicaraze-house in such a way as to-render its occupation as a dwelling-house almost imcossible; the nuisance was so great that the rev. plaintiff found it necessary to bring this action, as the defendant would not abate the nuisance, but40ontended that he had a right to have'these chimneys. A great many witnesses were caled, who proved that although one of the chimneys had existed for20 years, yet that the other four had been erected within a comparatively recent period, and that the smoke comoing from them was a great nuisance, and that when the wind was in a particular quarter the vicarage-house was completely enveloped in the smoLe issuing from the chimneys. The plaintiff roved that at certain times it was impossible to keep a windaw in the house open, nor could any one walk in the garden with an degree of comfort. For. the defendantit was argued-first, that the chimneys did not create any nuisance, but that even if the smoke did annoy the plaintif, it was only what any one must expect who came to a manufacturing town like Frome. and that if such an action as this should prevail it would completely put a stop to trade, and that tmight as well be said that the parks inLondon could not be used because they were surrounded with chimneys and smoke. Many witnesses were examined, with a view of shovring that this smoke was not a nuisance, and did not do any injury. e The last witness called was a washerwomau, 'who lived at a far greater distance from the defendant's premises than the plaintiff, but she admitted thawt when the wsind was in the north she waS- obliged to take in her clothes. A.lter a trial which lasted the whole day,v Tho jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 40s. damages, aud the judge certiSed that the action was brought to try a right. COPESrICK V. MALCKAY. Mr. H. T. Colo was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Kingdon appeared for the defendant. This was an action for assault. The defendant pleaded " Not Guilty." The plaintiff in this case'was a commercial traveller, and -it app'eared that, being at Bath,- he met an old friend, who asked bim to ga into the Dolphin Inm, and take some refreshment. lie there SW the defendant, who vas also talnngrefreshment there with a friend. A conversation took pLAce between the plaintifs friend, ;who was a livery stable7k-eeper named Ahplant, and the defendant relative to the sale of some horse property that morning, 'which the defendant said he had becamce the purchaser of. This wzas doubted by Ashplant, 'when Mackay, the defendanlt, pulled out a roll of n otes and offered to bet 51 he w;as the pur. chaser of the horses, which Ashplant declined to do. At this timeThe defendants friend said, "You see there is something got out of rags and bottles" (the defendant being a rag and bottle merchant). Tne plaintiff very innocently remarkedthat he knew where there were ten tons of rags for sale. This roused the ire of the rag mercha-nt, who thought the plaintiff was jeering him, andhe called him "a d-liar," and tooku p an earthenware cup and threw it in the plaintiffs face with all the force he could. It struck him on the arm, which he raised to protect his face, and also his face, cutting it and inflicting a severe blow, so that the plaintiff was obliged to resort to a surgeon. For the defence, it was contended that the action was of a trumpery character, -And ought to have been brought in the County Court. 3r.

ITpon telling him to get -up they foundhim without any shoes, and his stockngs were wet and dirty. Garett was also taken about the same time, returning to his lodgings in slippers.. It appeared that the thieves 'had effected an entrance by raismg the- coal-grid, which had been left unfastened, and by'tlhis means they gained access to the apper part of the house- The prosecutor, Mr. Gill, stated that he rented the-upper rt of the house, andthat his wifo and himself and the lodgers had retired to bed about-12 o'clock on Saturday ight, leaving the house safely secured, and about 3- o'clock in the morning he was aroused and alarmed by seeing two men moving about his room with a lighted candle, and getting out of bed,-he sezed the prisoner Roberts, and held him untiltwo of the lodgers,-who -had heard the cries of his -wife, came to miti he, and uponrgog downstairs for thepurpola-of pohcen he -found- the isreetdoor fastened in the - onalway, but the dey had beey taken away, ro that he was obliged.to return again to his room for a duphcalt key, md during thais taie the other prisoners escaped. e then went into the cebllr, and found that the coal-grid had been moved and the cellar door, in ch communicated ,vith the sllet, had beean fored openftom the insi2e, and throughs this door the burlars hid- mde their final exit The coats which were found were identiied by some of tle lodgers hr. jury,soweha ig addressed of the ureiobalote prisoner MWBride, - The learned JUDGE sumed ap, deprecating some observations modo by the learned counsle for the defence trepect. ingthe conduct of the police. In this case they had literally doune their duty, and nothing more, and it was necessar that such characters should- be watched; in ha lfe and property wrould not be safe without it. The jury who were i ignoance of he previous eharncterof the prisoners, having consulted for some littlle time,rturned a verdict of Guiltj, against both of theru, but werea about to recommend them to-mercy, whena Mr. B3aron Marne.-Stop, gentlemen; -you had better hear me before you say anything moore. The learned judgethen, addressing the prisoners, announced that MWBride ad. been previously convicted for vaoibus ofrencos no less than. 17 times, Garrett 11 timer, and Roberts once. His- ordship having distinguished the case of the latter from those of the former, sentenced MrBride-and Garrett to 10 year>' and Roberts to 4 years' penal wervitude. -. The look of astonishment upon the countenances of the jurymen, whose benevolent intentions had been.- thus. properly frustrated, caused some little merriment throughon the court. James Foster was indicted for the manslaughter of John Hayes, at Blackey lurst Colliery, on the 29th of Febrary last. M1r. Powell prosected, and-Mr. T. Atkinson defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prisoner was engaged as a collierat Blaclkey Hurst Colliery, near ian, on the 29th of February last. The deceased John Hayes and his brother 'sorled in the same colliery, about 14 yards from the place where the prisoner worked, and about four yr-rds from the pblae where the -pzisoner worked there were some old workings in which fire damp sometimes collected.- Both theprisonerandfltyes, the demeased, were supplied with Davy safety lamps, and it was their-duty to -work wth them closed. About half-past 2 o'clock- the deceased Hayes fired a blast inthe mine, or, as the witnesses calledit, "a shot," and -thin half an hour afterwards there was an explosion of fire-damp in -the mine near where the prisoner was working, which severely burnt the deceased and another man,- and --which had since caused the death of Hayes. - On examining the pit after the explosion the Davy lamp with which the prisoner had been working was found to be unscrewed and to have the wire gauze which protects the flame rmoved. On cross-examination of the witnesses, it appeared that the prisoner himself was burnt, and that he had a brother working in the same p it. After the "shot" fire damp was. seen igtntedhanging about the roof of the pit; althoug the wvitnesses said they had never known Sire damp to be exploded by a blast. Afdter this evidence his IOEDSHP said, the case against, the prisoner could not be proceeded w%ith, as for anything that appeared the explosion might have been caused by the ignited fire-damp hanging about, and that might have been ignited by the blast; although it was unquestionably extremely wrong that the prisoner should have worked with hislamp unprotected in the manner that he had done. Coal-miners ought to knowthat such carelessness was a very grave offence, and if it led to an explosion of fire-damp. which caused the death of any person, they were guilty. of manslaughter. Inthe present case, as the evidence was notconclusive against the prisoner. he must be acqnitted. Verdict accordingly. CIVmL CoURT.-Before Mr. Jlmticc WTLLEs.) BREWIN AIND OTHERS, ASSIGNESZ V.

(flW'VE,TPhP ',tA1PTT Sq1 The spring assizes for the county and city of Chester commenced this morning, before Mr. Justice Williams and Mr. Justice Erle-the former learned judge presiding in the Crown court, and the latter in the Nisi Prius. Their Lordships attended Divine senrice in the Cathedral yesterday, having been conveyed there in the High Sheriff's carriage, Mr. Richard C. Naylor, of Hooton-hall. The High Sheriff's equipage is splendid, surpassing anything of the kind which has preceded it in the county. There are 52 prisoners for trial, 11 of whom are charged with burglary. 10 cases are set down in the cause list for trial, one of which, " Roberts v. Hughes," is a special jury issue, and involves a claim arisin" out of the banquet given to Mr. Robert Stephenson, ?. 1t at Banor, in the yebr 1851, on the occasion of celebrating the completion of the Britannia tube on the Chester and Holyhlead Railway. The calendar also includes a charge of mn4aslaughter, preferred against William Williams, the railw-ay statiomnaster, at Tranmere, for having caused the death of Mr. John Blaylock, throu'°h neglect- likewise a charge against James Dalziel, of Liskard, of' having feloniously cassaulted Jane Jones, with intent to ravish her. Immnediately on the conclusion of his charge to the grand jury his Losnssearn ordered Jobn eahs, convicted at the winter assizes before Mr. Justice Cresswell, to be brought up for judgment. It will be remembered that the charge against Moah was that he had embezzled the sum of 5,000., received by him on behalf of the Crown, as receiver of Inland Revenue for portions of the districts of Lancashire and Cheshire. He was convicted on one count, charging him Nvith embezzling a specific sum of 560l., and Mr. Justice Cressswell at the time reserved a point to be argued before the Court above (which was raised at the trial by Mr. Ballantine, the prisoner's counsel), as to whether the indictment and conviction should not be quashed under the statute. The prisoner appeared at the bar neatly attired in a full suit of black. He glanced round the court, and manifested unusual confidence and coolness. The Clerk of the Crown, in caling upon the prisoner, said,-John Moah, you ha ve been convicted of embezzling 560?. belonging to Her Majesty and applying itto your own use; what have you to say why sentence should not he passed upon you accordin to Law ? His Loscsun' then said,john Moah, you vere tried and convicted at the gaol delivery in December last, in this county, for embezzlement as a public servant, while in the employ of the Crown. Some points of law arose in the course of your trial which the learned judge before whom you were tried thought fit to submit to the Court above. The case was fully argued before that Court, and the judges unanimously came to the conclusion that the conviction was a proper one, and it is now my duty to pass upon you the sentence of the law. The sentence which the Court thinks proper in your case is, that you be transported beyond the seas for the term of 14 years. Tne sentence, which was listened to with much interest in a crowvded court, was received by the prisoner without showing the slightest emotion.
POLICE. 31A3sio5-nHovsE.-The followling communication was made to the LOBD MAYOR on the part of the lice of HEIamburg, relative to the statements which have been recently published in the English newspapers upon the abduction from London of a girl named Susannah Evans, who was detained and sent back by the authorities at Hamburg, whichl statements the police of that city considered in some respect to be incorrect, and to cast reflections upon them which they did not deserve:- Thepolice of Hamburg were requested by a telegraphic message from the superintendent of police, city of Lendon, on the Gth of March, to arrest one Susannah Evans, who was about to arrive in company with a man whose description was given, and several other girls, by the steamer Countess of Lonsdale, on the 7th of March, at Hamburg. The necessarymeasures forthe fulfilment of this request were imnnediately adopted,and the designated persons -ere on their arrival on board the steamer taken into custodybythe police, andbroughtdirectlyto the head office of the police. Thesepersons were the above-named Susannah Evaus, fire other English girls, and one Maria Schein, who accompanied them. These persons were interrogated by a functionary of the crinmial jurisdiction who is conversant with the English language. It became evident, by such inquiry, that Susannah Evans, who said she Wa5 15 years old, but who appeared older, had not fully known for what purpose she had been brought ever. The other girls, who bad evidently belonged to the worst class of London prostitutes, had come over wsith the free resolution to enter into a house of prostitution, and they declared that such was still their intention. It was found necessary to send three of these girls to the hospital in consequence of bodily indisposition. The remaining two being of full age, so that the police had no right to interfere, wenit to a brothel kept by a person named Miunch, according to their owvn wish. " Some days later the police officer whose arrival had been announced by the tclegraphic message presented himself to the police at H-mburg. Susannah Evans, wlho till then had not been kept in a house of detention, but who had been given into the charge of a respcectable private w oman, was, placed at the disposal of the English police officer, and the proceedings of the police were communicated to him. The interview he desired with the other girls was not only conceded with all possible facility, but an offer was made to h'limU to take back with him all these persons, but he declined to do so, after having seen the two prostitutes at the house of Slinmch, and having refused to see the three other girls who had been sent to the hospital. " In this whole case the Haamburg police have acted with the strongest desire to facilitate the object of the police officer, who repeatedly expressed his thanks for the obhiIng manner in which all his requests had been complied with, andwho desired on his departure to be presented to the chief of the police, and assured him that all his wishes had been fully attended to, and that his superiors would be willing to reciprocate their services. " It may also be stated that the accusation of theft against Susannab Evans, alluded to in the Englishl papers, had hardly come under consideration, but was immediately overruled." The LorD 3Ms &os Said, he felt sure that the press woid give the same publicity to the communication which had been made on the part of the police of Hamburg as had been given to the report of the London officer. John Felix, a powerful fellow, who said lie was alabourer, wras charged with committing a most brtal and ruffianly assault upon a woman with whom he had for some months cohabited, named 31ary An Brooks. 'he prisoner had been remanuded for some days in order that the prosecutrix, who had been an inmate of St. Bartholomeew's Hospital ever since the time the assault was committed, might personally attend. The Lor.D MrYon saidthatthewhole case presented far too serious an aspect to be dealt with summarily, and hethought the endsof justice could onlybe attained by committing the prisconer to the Central Criminal Court for trial on the charge of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting upon the prosecutrix grievous bodily harm. Committed accordingly. -Bow-srREET.-A nuinber of boys, of ages varying from 12 to 16, were severally charged with throwing stones at the oeidiers en3gagc&in vworking the park guns. It appeared that about 1 o'clock that afternoon orders mere received to fire the gns in celebration of the signing of the Treaty of Peace. They were accordingly got ready on the parade; but, the order being countermnanded at the last *moment, the charges were drawn and the guns removed. A crowd had assembled, principally of boys, some of whom commenced pelting the soldiers and the police apprehended all whom they caught in the act of throwing stones. Penalties were inflicted of from 6s. to 10s., or, in default, imprisomnent for from seven to 10 days. illiam Randall, aged 23, was fined 20s., or, in default, sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment, for a similar offence. * WEsTmrmSTER-Thomas Hoare was finally examined, charged with feloniously assaulting and wounding MichaelI Welsh with an axe. * He was committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court. CLeLURMS.WELL.-The sitting magistrate requested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of 21. 2s. from "S. P.," for the use of the iused police-officer Chapman, with a wife and nine children, who was so dreadfully maltreated by the ticket-of-leave man, Hogan (who stands committed from the Thames Police-court), as to cause hira to be incapacitated from further service and to render him a cripple for life. THAEs.-John Connor, aged 19, a well-known thief, of 19, Glasshonse-yard, Whitechapel, was charged with assaulti', Peter Fitz, and stealing from him a silver watch, vled at 51. It appeared from the evidence that on Saturday night, between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock, the prosecutor, who is ashipwright, livinginTarling-street, St. George's-in-the-E-ast, 'was passing along a crowded part of Ratcliff-highway, when he 'was suddenly stopped by three men, of -whom the prisoner was one. In endeavouring to pass them he went into the roadway, when one of the, fellows struck him on the belly, another immcdiately clasped him round the waist, and the prisoner seized his watch guvrd, broke the ring by which the watch was attached to it, and snatched the watch out of the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket. Fitz struggled with. his assailants, on 'which the risoner tripped him up and ran away with the 'watch. The prosecutor was soon on his legs, and pursued himl through several streets and alleys, until the prisoner reached a place near the London Dock wall. 'Upon finding himself closely pressed, he threw the watch over a fence into a yard. A boy named William Bond scaled the fence and recovered the watch. The prisoner was captured and secured. The prisoner made no defence, and, on Mr. YASRDLEY asking if he was known, police-constable Townshend. 54 fl, said, the prisoner had been summarily convicted and sentenced to various tenms of imprisonment and hard labour on several occasions; and that in April last he was convicted and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and hard labour by the Assistant-Judge, at the Clerkenwell Sessions. Ie believed there were two convictions recorded against the prisoner, but he (Townshend) was only present at one. hlr. YAiDLE z committed the prisoner for trial. Mr. YARiDLEY announced the receipt of the following donations for the relief of the wife and nine children of James Chapman, a police-constable, 38 E, whose leg was broken by Michael Hogan, a ticket-of-leave conviCt :- W. Hurst, 21. "N S ."1S. ";. L.," 5s.; -"M N.," 1?.; and " A Scotehman," 4s. A notice of each donation was requested to be made in TZhe Tines. Mr. Yardley has also received the remaining halves of two 101. Bank of England notes, Nos. 78,253 and 78,256, from "A. C.,"for the poor-box fund. A notice of their safe arrival, in The Times, was requested. SouTavAnsc.-In the course of the afternoon a gentleman entered the court, and presented to his Worship 10s. for the poor-box, being the sum allowed to the jury at the Borough Court of Record for two trials that day. Oor reporter was requested to acknowledge the receipt of the same in The Timzes.
CHURCH-RATES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDIES. Sir,-May I beg permission through your columns to make a few remarks on what appears to me the very objectionable and unsatisfactory character of the Government amendments on Sir W. Clay's bill for the abolition of church-rates? In the fi-st place, any person by registering himself a Dissenter may avoid the payment of church-rates. But meanwhile nothing is said aboutvwhether such person, after registering, is or is not to retain his church pewv, rights of marriage, burial, &c., on the very same telms as before. Surely this is extremely unreasonable. If a man chooses to exonerate himself from the expenses of maintaining the church and churchyard in his parish, he surely ought to lose claim to the rites of the one or the precincts of the other. Again, when the church-rates have ceased in a parish, after some cumbrous preliniinaries, the churchwardens have the power of letting two-thirds of the sittings in the church; provided one-third are left free. Now, if a number of persons choose to subscribe and build a church, such a conditior is not unreasenable. They then count the cost beforehand, and make their arrangements accordingly. But is it fair to say to half-a-dozen persons, who might possibly find themselves the onlv contributors-" You shall maintain the church, not only for yourselves, but for perhaps some hundred who might occupy the freesittings i" Again, what is to be done-in the numerous exceptional eases likely to occur? Take the following, for instance, which I copy from one of the public prints :-"One case has just been brought to our notice, viz., that of Shepreth, Cambridgeshire. The parish contains more than 300 inhabitants, and there were two services; average attendance-morning, 90; afternoon, 120. The vicar was compelled on the 17th ult. to give notice that the church would be closed till further notice, for the following reasons:- " 1. That the churchwardens, though bound to do so by law, do not provide what is necessary for the decent performance of divine worship. " 2. That an architect who has examined the building certifies that the church is in such a dilapidated state that it is insecure for public worship. I" The churchwardens have been cited to appear before the archdeacon, who has given judgment, directing them to put the church in repair and to Pay the costs of the citation. One of them, a magistrate, has let more than half the parish to a Dissenter free of church-rates, stating that he (the landlord) is responsible for them." What, Sir, is to be done in such a case as this, -when a Dissenter owns more than half, perhaps all the land in a parish ? Or on wxhat principle of justice are the poor inhabitants of Shepreth to be deprived of the yearly sum necessary to maintain the church-a sum to which they have as good a title as the wealthy Dissenter has to the estate which se seeks to exonerate from its payment? Nor would Shepreth be a solitary instance of such hardship; a great proportion of England is in the hands of wealthy and often absent proprietors. They would be the gainers by the abolition of church-rates. The tenantry and labouring population would not gain; they would lose. They vould have to maintain their own fabrics for public worship and instruction. Surely, Sir, it is not a little extraordinary, when so much is said in this age of boasted light and philanthropy about extending the privileges of the less wealthy classes, that Parliament should gravely sit down to entertain a project which is in effect to rob them of privile-es and property-to take no higher view of the case--worth little short of half-a-million, and this without the shadow of an equivalent. I have the honour to be, Sir, Faithfully vours. SAMUEL N. XDTGDON. I Bridgerule, March 27.
STATISTICS OF CRIuE BY ENzG1iD.-A blue-book, just issued from the office of the Queen's printers, gives the 16th report of the inspectors appointed to visit the different prisons of Great Britain. It contains general statistics of crime, extending over a period of from 8 to 10 years, between 1S41 and 1850, to enable the institution of a comparison between the progress of population in connexion with that of crimne. It appears that while the population has increased abouit 121 per cent. decennially, and 1-192 per cent. annuaUly,the rnnnnal committalshaveaccumnilatedasttherate of 11-3 per cent. decennially, and 1-081 per cent. annually; so thatthe increase of crime hasbeenless decenniallyby1-2 per cent. than the ascertained rate of the population, and less, annually, by .111 per cent. But if the criminal commitals, including examined and discharged prisoners, be divided into quin-quennial periods, the result is that the increase will be found to be only at the rate of 7-1 per cent. over that of the period of five years, thus placing crime in a still more favourable light. The number of committals from 1841 to 184-5 (both inclusive), amoumted to 536,691, and the number from 1846 to 1850, to 574,669. Thus crime may be reported to be almost stationary with regard to the population, and at these rates of increase the population would double itself in 586S years, and crime double itself in 64-6 years. The general returns for England and Wales, to which the present inquiry extends, show a considerable amount of diminution in 1850 as compared with 1849. The prisoners for trial or tried at assizes and sessions in 1849 amounted to 28,752, and in 1850 to 26,463, showing a decrease of commitments in this class of 8 6 per cent. The summary convictions in l849.amountedto 90,963, andiniS60 to 80,GO only, exhibiting a decline of 128 per cent. Assizes sessios, and summary convictions togetner amounted, in 1849 to 119,715 prisoners, and in 1850 to 107,071, which gives a total diminution of 11a per cent., or 12,644prisoners less. a dimiontion is fonld in all the smmary convictions except three, i. c., the revenee law, assaults, and want of sureties. A decrease of 9 per cent. is reported in the commitments of juvenile offenders in 18.50, and the summary convictions exhibit a diminution of 1a 6 Per cent. In the recommittals, there was a decline in 1850, of 6'4 per cent. The pardons on medical grounds in 1850 amounted to 77, being a decrease of 19 6 per cent. The diseases which thus exempt prisoners from ftsrtller punishment are consmuption, scrofula, diseases of the brain and nervous system, mental diseases, and diseases of the heart and lungs other than scrofulous and consumptive. 200 prisoners died in 1850, against 341 inlS49 (including 10 suicides). Thecasesof lunacy recorded in 1850 amounted to 119, against 68 in 1849. We are sorry to report that the statistics of the educational knowledge at the period of the committals of the prisoners, recorded in the tables from 1841 to 1850, show that no ipiprovement whatever bas taken place in this branch, and that altogether the tables exhibit the worst results of the whole statistics of crime. The state of the juvenile population, in particular, is very unsatisfactory. .The average or annual mean centesimal I proportions of the state of instruction, for the decennial Ipenod, of prisoners tried at assi7es, was as follows.- 90-31 per cent. of the adult prisoners had little or no instruction, and 96'27 of the juveniles were in the same woful state of ignorance. Taking both together. i90'99 per cent. had httle or no instruction; 8162 could read and write vell; and *36 per cent. had a superior education. The average or annual mean centesimal proportions of the state of instruction of the prisoners under summary conviction were, 95-36 per cent. with little or no instruction, and 3-98 who could read and write well (taking the adults and the juveniles under one head). In the ysar IS85, of prisoners tried at assizes, 31-17 per cent. could neither read nor write, 22 21 could read only, and 37 69 could only read or write imperfectly, 8-40 could do both well, and 50 had had a superior education. The eentesimal proportions of educational knowledge of prisoners and summary conviction at the period of their committals, in the year 1850, was 95a97 per cent. with little or no instraction, 3-52 who could read and write well, and -16 of superior education. The .gross expenditure for tho maintenance of risoners in 1850 amounted to 408,3201., agiast 433,701 in 849.

Onthe 30th, at 7 p.mL: she passed the Cambria, hence for Borston. The United States' ail steamer Hfermann, from Southamnpton, had arrived out. In the-Senate, :Nfr Douglas reported a bill, authorizing the people of-Kansas to forn a State Governmnent, preparatory to her admission into the Union, when she shall have a requisite population. Mir. Clayton made a speech on the ClaytonBulwer Treaty. He alluded to the course followed by Great Britain in regard to it; to the proposed Pacific Railroad; to the importance of an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama; to the Transit Company's difficulty, to the Filibustering and General Walker. He expressed his gratification at the extraordinary unanimity shown during the discussion in the Senate with regard to the construction of that treaty, and saw that all gentlemen had agreed in repudiating as utterly unworthy their xegard the new construction put upon -it by the British Government. He entirely |approved the conduct of the Administration I relative to the difficulties with England, and highly eulogized the State papers of Messrs. Marcy and Buchanan. He was also gratified at the energy with which the Administration had put down the Filibustering schemes, and he denounced General Walker as a riffian, bucanier, and pirate. He was no partisan of the President, but when their foreign relations were conducted with signal ability he was willing to give the A dministration due credit. In the House of Representatives the discussion of the Kanzas election had been continued. The Iretw York Herald says - "Our Washington correspondent states, upon good authority, that Mr. Crampton will be recalled. It is intimated [that he has incurred the censure of his Governulent by the course he followed in the enlistment affair." A Baltimore shooner had been seized at New York, under orders of the United States' district attorney, charged with being fitted out as a slaver. A destructive fire had occurred at Boston and destroyed $56,000 worth of property. A fearful accident had occurred on the Delaware River. One of the Camcden and Philadelphia ferryboats took fire when in the middle of the stream. The flames spread with great rapidity. The boat became unmanageable. The passengers, about 100 in number, panicstricken, leapt into the water, to escape a terrible death by burning. MIany of them were picked up, but some 30 were drowned. The sacrifice of life is attributable to the ferryboat being destitute of small boats and life-preservers. Governor Reeder was elected United States' Senator of the first ballot for six years, and General Lane on the second, three years, by the Legislature of Kanzas, which remained in session. The George Law had arrived from Aspinwall with the California mails and late news from the West Coast and Sidney, Australia; she had $1,219,053 in treasure. An omnibus line in conjunction with the railway was about to be started at Panama. The project wras wrell supported by the people. The railroad dep6t was comnpletely filled' by the Eiuropean and American merchandise waiting for transport. to South America and Caifornia. The State debt, amounting to $10,000, due to Senor Calvo, had been paid. Congress had assembled and was organized at Bogota. The. Death Penalty BiUl had been abolished. The Vice-President's Message gave a gratifying report of the state of the country. WVe learn from Guatemala that General Carrera had returned to the capital after a tour in the interior provinces. The Legislative Amssembly had dissolved, and the Carnival was being observed. A gpeneral uneasiness existed in the public minds with regard to the prospect of a Wallker-Rivas invasion. The cochineal crop was damaged by a sudden fall of volcanic fiego ashes, which entered the ground for 40 leagues. The Panama papers state that Honduras was marching a force of 5,000 men against Walker. Trade at San Juan was very dull. The French frigate l'Ambuscade had reached Punta Arenas with strict orders to put down any Filibustering expedition she might fall in with on the higl seas. Two valuable coal mines had been discovered at Talcahuano. Flour had fallen in Valparaiso from $10 to -8 25c. In San Salvaclor, Don R. Campos had been inaugurated as President. He affixed his first official seal to a contract with the Panama Railway Company's agent for the authorizing of the steam conuntuication spoken of before. Coffee was being largely cultivated. The Costa Ricaus were determined to resist the threats of the rejected Nicaragua envoys. From Mexico, tics Havannah, we learn that Puebla was besieged by 7,000 troops, and was expected soon to surrender. The road to Mexico was unsafe for travelling. From Vera Cruz we learn, vid New Orleans, that General Comonfort left the capital on the 29th ilt., to put himself at the head of the troops to besiege Puebla; he -would have 12,000 troops and 48 pieces of artillery. The officers who led the revolt at the Castle of San Juan de Ulloa had been sentenced to be shot. The departure of Nicaragua Filibusters from New Orleans was openly proclaimed in the'papers. Havannah advices are to the 13th inst. Sugar was sliglhtly declining, and freights improving. There had been a grand reception at Mr. Crawford's, of Havannah, to which all the British officers in port were invited. Some of them got intoxicated and insulted two Philadelphia ladies. An apology was tendered next day, and the affair was amicably arranged. Ulnder date of the 10th inst. it is stated that the British ship of war Powerful had arrived on the 1st with orders to inite there all the English and French forces stationed in the MIexican Gulf, and to start immediately for Nicaragua. Australian markets -were dull, and provisions heavy. At Sydney flour had fallen in price, being down to 251. per ton, with very heavy stocks on hand. In Melbourne no less than 8,000 tons of flour and wheat had been stored for want of sale. and several cargoes were on the way, so that there was no prospect of famine. From Bermuda advices are tne 3d of M£arch. The Governor had issued a proclamation dissolving the Parliament which had been in existence for the usual period of six years. Writs for the election of new members had been issued. Her Britannic Majesty's ships Pembroke and Cornwallis were stfill at the island. COMMERCIAL 1ELLIGENCE. The supply of floating capital in the money-market was abundant, at 7 to 9. Orders 9 per cent. for first-class mercantile acceptances, and 6 to 7 per cent. on call. The statement for last week was unfavourable, the loans and discounts amounted to upwards of $104,500,000, and inereased since the 1st of December LaEt $12,000,000. The specie reserves were about $14,000,000, showing a fall of only $2,7.50,000 since the 1st December. Thiseexpansion was considered dangerous to tha commercial community. Exchange was filat at 9- to 91 on Eondon ; 5f. 18c. to 5f. 17lc., 60 days, and .5f. 12Ac. short siaht, on Paris; 6, to 36g on Bremen; and 5f. 17c. on Antwerp.

The Plata brings about 70 passengers, and on freight 2,839,000 dollars in specie, 45,000 dollars on account of the Mfexican dividends, and the usal Cargo. The Atrato arrived at St. Thomas's on the 16th inst. La Plata reports that on the 30th of January the Chiliau war steamer Cazador left Talcahuano, having on board 358 persons, 86 of whom were soldiers, four officers, and the remainder wo0men, chiildren, and the crew. Shortly after leaving she ran upon a rock and sank. Only 43 persons were saved, one of that numnber being a womean, the only survivor out of 148 women. The captain was placed under arrest. There is little intelligence of interest from Jamaica. The Legislathre was prorogued on the 27th of February.- Her Majesty's steamers Termagant and Malacca had sailed for. Port-au-Prince, Hayti having been represented to be iU a convulsed state, owing to the recvated defeats sustained by the E;mperor Soulouque. It was rumoured that Sir Henzy Barkly would shortly leave Jamaica for England. There is little change in the markets. Exchange was quoted for 60 days at 1-E per cent. premium. The disturbances at Demerara had ceased. A MIilitia had been formed, the number of persons already enrolled being upwards of 1,000. At Grenada sugar-making was progressing rapidly, and was materialy assisted by the fine weather; the growing crops, however, were not in so fine a condition, in consequence of the previous heavy rains. There was no improvement in mercantile transactions, and high prices continued to be demanded. In Mexico it was rumonred that if Antonio Haro y Tamaris, who was occupying Puebla, and who is chief of the Conservative party, and supported by the clergy, should become President, instead of Comonfort, the States of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Sinaloa would probably form a separate republic. Colonel 'Kinney, who visited Grenada for the purpose of paying his respects to General Walker, was by the General's orders immeediately arrested and imprisoned; but the people, thinking such an order unjust, refused to obey it, and the Colonel afterwards returned to Greytown; since then a proclamation has been issued declaring all Colonel Einney's estates to be confiscated. The general health of the West India Islands is good, with the exception of Porto Rico, where the cholera still Prevailed. At iBarbadoes the weather was favourable to sugar-making and the crop promised to be a large one. The crop season was likewise favourable at St. Vincent's. In Peru General Cassilla was about to dissolve the session, in order to proclaim himself Dictator. The N2ational Convention was still sitting, but everytling remained in a most unsettled state; trade was paralyzed, and business of all kinds very dull. At Costa Rica fears were entertained that Walker would invade the territory, and seize upon PurLtas Arenas for the purpose of sacking and destroying it.
CHURCH DISCIPLINE BILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIMES. Sir,-You have well said in your article of yesterday that, beyond the abolition of one preliminary court of inquiry, you " do not:see what the present biU does either to eue. dite or cheapen ecclesiastical justice." Its main feature, as regards the leading object for which a discplipne bill is required-the correction of clerical misconduct-is to establish the four chancellors, with their clerks, to whom you allude, who are to act as assessors to the archbishops and bishops. To effect that object, which surely is not one requiring very elaborate provisions, what does the bill propose ? It proposes, directly and indirectly, to abolish every vestige of local ecclesiastical jurisdiction (except visitations, which must be held in the country), and to centralize the whole in two large establishments-one in London, and one in D3ublin. Will you believe, Sir-by way of illustration -that if a person living (e. g.) in Cornwall or Northumberland has occasion to be ordained, or instituted and inducted to a living, or licensed to a curacy there, the letters of orders and other instruments necessary for those purposes are, under this bill, to be "prepared" in London, and " signed' by one of these new chancellors? or, again, that every licence for marriage according to the rites of the church of England is to be "supplied" from London? I could multiply instances, but I have said enough to give you an idea of the general character of the bill. The fact is, that this bill is part of a system of centralization in London, which prevails among some of our leading legislators-a system to which the country must offer a determined opposition, unless it is prepared to admit that all the ability, and all the honesty,- and all the practical aptitude for business 'wLich exist are to be found in London, and nowhere else, and that, to insure the proper transaction of their affairs, people from one end of the kingdom to the other must resort to London. The bill is also part of another system which is not to be contented -with carrying out one definite object, intelligible and necessary, but to encumber it with others not understood and not called for, merely to meet the crotchets of some one who assumes to know more than any one else upon the subject of legal reform. To these two systems may be attributed the delay and difficulty which have occurred with regard to many uiseful measures of reform. Take the case of "testamentary jurisdiction." A commission, consisting of some of the ablest lawyers in the several departments, was, in 1852, appointed to consider the question of testamentary jurisdiction. They made a full report in 1854, and recommended the establishment of an independent court of probate in London, and district offices throughout the country for the convenience of the local public. In 1854 the Lord Chancellor brings in a bill adopting the report as regarding district offices, but taking the central jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery. The Court of Chancery is obnoxious to the countryat large. TheLord Chancellor will not abandon his own personal views-the bill is carried through the Lords, but is obliged to be abandoned in the Conunons. In 1855 the Solicitor-Generalhimself a member of the commission-brings in a bilL He adopts the report to some extent as regards the central jurisdiction, but totally ignores and sets at defiance the recommendation of the report as to the district offices. On that ground mainly the bill is opposed, and it dies an early death. This year, again, he has introduced a similar bill, and I anticipate a similar result. Thus the crochet of the Lord Chancellor in the one case, and the centralizing spirit of the Solicitor-General and his open defiance of the report, in the other, retard the passing of a measure which, had either of them yielded his personal opinion to that of the commissioners expressly appointed to consider the subject, would probably have already passed into a law. And so in the case of the Church Discipline BilL Some measure is imperatively caRled for, but who will say that, because the present system for enforcing church discipline requires improvement, therefore it is necessary to abolish all local ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and to establish a huge system of centralzation, with chanceUlors, deputy-chancellors, clerks, registrars, treasurers, record-keepers, and "'other officers," and "lands and buildmigs aud chambers" in London? The answer made may be that if a court must be created, means must be provided for payment of the expenses of it; and, therefore, that all matters of ecclesiastical jurisdiction (whether relevant or not) must be brought within the jurisdiction of the court, in order that, by means of the fees, a fund may be provided. But, in the first place, who will say that the cases of clerical delinquency are so frequent, and the archbishops and bishops so frequently presiding in their courts upon those subjects, as to require, by ay of aid, the permanent appointment of four chancellors, at salaries of 3,0001. a-year each, with clerks at 600. a-year, and other incidental expenses? And, in the second place, why cannot the fees from the various matters now sought to he centralzed be carried to a common fund (the officers being paid by salariesj as easily with the retention of the local jurisdictions as under a system Ywhich takes the w;hole to London ? I am sorry to have troubled you at such length, but the matter requires to be fully understood by the public; and no means so effectual can be found as by drawing their attention to it through your columns. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A COUNTRY SOLICITOR. A lraTC i. THE CRIMEAN- BOARD OF LNQuiRY.-The meetir.o of this Board, appears as remote and as uncertain as ever. Yesterday failed, as usual, to solve the problem, and no positive information upon the subject could be obtained in any quarter, although it was statedthatthe inquiry woud not commence until all the witnesses likely to be examined were on the spot.
THB CBYSTAL PALACE. The appointment of a general manager and the rough but healthy process of investigation to which the shareholders of the Crstal Palace Company recently subjected its affairi are already yielding the most beneficial results at Sydenham, and we are permitted to hope that the adverse influences which have clouded the prospects of this r oble endertakdng are gradually passing away. It ought not to be a matter of surprise that during the transition period between the completion of the works and the realization of the comanercial calculations upon which they were commenced rnir givings as to the success of the enterprise shouid be generaUll entertained. Evervthing that is new and grand in its character is more or less exposed to such misgivings, and they only disappear when prudence and liberality in the mangement have clearly demonstrated that they are unfounded. Mr. Ferguson and the directors have, we ae glad to find, prepared a programme for the approaching season .which ought to be considered satisfactory by the public, and to rescue from any doubts which may hang upon it the attractiveness of the Palace. Before stating what is ,proposed for the spring and sumner let us explain the steps which have been taken to rectify admitted evils in the previous arrangements. Instead of having to enter the main building through the refreshment department, the visitor by rail will pass along a new route into the south transept. Defects in the wor} of the interior and blemishes caused by leakage or otherwise have been carefully removed, and the importance of order and good keeping in the appearance of every object seems to be fully recognized. Messrs. Staples have now had time toputtheir culinary arrangements for all classes of customers upon a more satisfactory footing than hitherto, and we have no doubt will steadily persevere until they have made the Crystal Palace caff4, as it ought to be, the largest and best conducted establishment of the kind in the world. In the gallery over theAssyrian Court a small but exceedingly well-selected collection of Indiau and Chinese objects has beenformed. TheSheffieldCourthasbeenfiled vith achoice display of the peculiar productions of that great centre of industry, and offers so good an illustration of what may be done in this way that the other leading manufacturing towns can scarcely fail to follow the example thus set them. The show of agricultural implements, also, has for some time past been in complete order, and is found to answer its purpose admirably. There may be seen all the best mechanical appliances now in use in connexion with the cultivation of the soil, exhibited by the most eminent makers; and a goodly display our Ransomes, Garratts, Crossldlls, and Hormsbys make in a branch of industry which has in a few years raised the agriculture of England to a foremost place in the march of material progress. The machinery department, though still far from complete, is at length in a state which vill admit of its contents being exhibited in motion in a few days, and, once fairly seen at work, there is quite enough and of sufficient excellence toinsurean attractiveness, which in time will compel a full representation of the mechanical ingenuity of the coiuntry. Of the plants with which the vastinterior of thePalace is adorned it is unnecessary to say more than that the close of another -winter leaves them in the finest order, and that every day seems to add to the effect which they produce upon the eye of the visitor' The camelias are now in fill bloom, and the tropical collection exhibits a luxuriance and splendour of growth and form surpassing all that Sir J. Paxton's promises led the public to expect. But it is on the terraces and in the grounds of the park3 outside that the great gardener's plans and arrangements now begin to unfold themselves most surprisingly. The rude traces of labour have at length disappeared, the entire system of fountains is complete, and, when fine weather sets in sufficiently for the playing of the great waters, sightseers may prepare them. selves for a spectacle such as of its kind the world has never witnessed. When the :on. Horace Greeley was in this country some short time ago he 'was asl3ed what he thought of the Crystal Palace?-" It-ain't handy to the citizens of Londc.:," was the " smart" 'and truthful reply ofthe American journalist. It will be months, we fear, notwithstanding every effort, before Sydenham. is made as accessible as it ought to be to the inhabitants of the metropolis, and until that is accomplished the commercial success of the Palace cannot be fairly tested. 2hr. Ferguson and the directors have been doing all they possibly could, under the circumstances, to increase the existing facilities for traffic, or to find new ones; but what is requisite in this respect demands time, and meanLwhile the bulk of the visitors must follow the dreary route by the London-bridge terminas. Probably during the summer months the new General Omnibus Company would find it both popular and advantageous to organize a cheap and convenient system of communication from town to the Palace. 1litherto the experiment has never been fairly tried, and, indeed, the moment had not arrived for maling it, but in a short time hence -we believe that it would at least be found worthy of careful consideration. F?rom the programme we gather that the directors intend rmaidngk several additions and alterations besides those already noticed. Among these is included the formation oI a picture gallery for the exhibition and sale of the workcs of modern artists, native and foreign. This gallery will be situated in the north wing, now occupied by the raw produce collection, which is to be removed to the middle gallery on the garden side of the great transept. The directors have also commenced the fonnation of a museum of naval architecture, an object which is certain to find a favourable reception inthis maritime country. It will be arranged in the gallery at the north end of the building, and in connexion vith it will be exhibited a collection of engineering and architectural models, for the establishment of which abundant materials can be readily procured. In one ofthe Industrial Courts on the gardern side of the Palace the directors announce their intention shortly to open a display of ceramic manufactures. They state that they have received extensive promises of assistance in this object, and there can be no doubt of its attractiveness if a fair amount of judgment is exercised in the selection and arrangement. Perhaps, however, the most important aud satisfactory feature of the programme for the approaching season isthe announcement,that the Governments of Canada and New Branswick have agreed permanently to occupy spaces in the Palace with exhibitions of the products and manufactures of those important colonies, It is quite unnecessary to comment upon the value and interest of such exhibitions, tending, as they obviously must, to remind the mother country of the progress which her distant dependencies are making in those arts by which she herself has grown wealthy, great, and free. The success which has attended the Saturday concerts has determined the directors to form as good a concert-room as the character of the building will admit of, and theypropose havfiig it close to the central transept, and capable of accommodating from 3,000 to 4,000 persons. In this, as in other respects, they appear bent on leaving nothing that lies within their power undone to make the Palace fulfil those objects of popular instraction and amasement for which it was undertak;en. Bat, in truth, itis already more than sufficiently attractive-it is already the chcapest and most enjoyable shilling's worth of sightseeing in the world, and all that is really requisite for its prosperity as a commercial enterprise is to make it more "handy to the citizens of London." Until that is accomplished the company must be dependent to a greater extent than is at all pradent upon the revenue to be derived from season-ticket holders, who are only tempted to subscribe in great numbers by the prospect of grand ftes and other extraordinary displays, necessarily involving a large outlay in the arrangements connected with them. The Palace is so admirably adapted for exhibitions of the kind that they will always take, place there under the most advantageous circumstances, but, if it is ever destined to have a steady return for its invested capital, the company must expect that return mainly from the dailyand common-run attendance of visitors. :ihreeflower showsare announced by the directors during the appraching summer months-the first on the 24th of May, the second on the 20th and 26th of June, the last, intended specially for amateurs, on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of September. On these occasions the attendance will, no doubt, be laige. but the greagreat event of the Se fokSr Sydenainwil proably be the occasion when, for the first time, the whole system of 'waterworks-fountains, c-ascades, and waterfalls-is displayed in full operation. ________

At that date the fears 'vhich had arisen from the progress of the malady in our Eastern army had begun to diminish. Tho number of sick in the last few days had considerably lessened.

THE EDUCATION I4TE. TO TRB EDITOR OF TUE TEM. Sir,-The " Nottinghamshire Clergyman" has not again appeared in your columns, but the Rev. lMr. Woodgate has come to the rescue; and I 'wish, by your kind permission, to make a few remarks upon his letter. The rev. gentlemen writes with more caution, with greater candour, and in a better temper than his ally; but he aims at the same end, and he seeks to attain it by the same means -by diverting public attention from the real state of the question, and making it appear that the only thing wanted is toget the children to the schools; it is sought to accom. plipsh the great object of the party to which both of these rev. gentlemen belong-viz., to leave the present system unchanged; " it works well as far as it goes." Mlr. Woodgate says, "I quite agree with the 'INottinghamshire Clergman' that the real problem to be solved | is, not how to raise the necessary fmnds for educational pur4 I poses, but to induce the poor to avail themselves of them,- not how to erect schools, but to procure children to fil them." If he will make due inquiries he will find that both these problems require solution. If hewill investigate dispassionately the state of the whole country; if he 'wll apply even to his own boasted raral 2eanery a test of which he does not seem to have thought, he will, I think, find himself obliged to abandon the opinion I havejust quoted. Mr. Woodgate descnbes his deanery, and says that in that dishict, "as regards the means of education, the supply is considerably in advance of tne demand." Now, the va7ue of this statement depends on the meanin which the writer attaches to the phiase "meal s of education ;" I suspect, from the context, that when he uses th-t phrase he zneans " schoolrooms,`'-when I use it I mesix " money." There are moany things wanted before we shall have a systeem of education of the poor worthy of being ca2led national; but the one paramount want is money. Will :Mr. Woodgate grapple with this assertion and dis. prove it if he can? Will he ask the struggling clergy, who are not so fortunate as to date from "Bellbroughton Rectory," and who are writing to the education societies and the Committee of Council from all parts of England to say that they must close their schools unless help be given, vwhether they think "it works well- as far as it goes '' Perhaps they would retort by aking " how far does it goP" The children's payment is generally 2L per head per week; the usual cost of the schools is 6d. per head per week. Whereisthe4d. tocome from? Is there any source, permanent and reliable for all parts of England, except a rate? Will Mr. Woodgate answer this question? My interpretation of what he says as to his own deanery is that he finds in most of its parishes a good schoolroomi.e., a schoolroom larger than the number of scholars requires. I suspect he would find in many of these good schoolrooms bad schoolmasters. I ask him to try his " means of education" by this testare the schools worth going to? I haveno doubt some of them are. There are many bright I lights scattered about the country, wshich serve to show the depth of the surrounding darkness; but I have as little doubt that some of them are not. If I am wrong in this opinion, and Mr. Woodgate can. really aisure the public that all the parishes in his deanery are not only provided with schools, but with good schools, I can only say he lives in a fortunate district, which is no criterion of the state of the rest of England; and in this case let him remember that no rate -ill be asked for in those parishes. I do not deny-in my last letter I admitted-the evil of which Mr. Woodgate complains, that children go to work at too early an age, instead of remaining at schlool; but I do deny that this is the only impediment, or even the greates' impediment, to the proper education of the people. I mns' also repeat my belief that this evil would be much less than it is if the schools were everywhere properly supported. M1r. Woodgate proceeds, however, to admit, with a candour which is chonourable to himself, but fatal to his cause, that there is another great evil in existence-he does not deny that there are " hundreds of tnousands who, out of the 5,000,000 between the ages of 6 and 15 who ought t6 be at school or at work, are renorted to be at neither one nor the other;" having made this admission, he proposes a remedy-and what is it? "F aith and pAtience P' Again, he admits in still stronger terms, " It is awful to think of thehundreds of thous^nds who are allowed to grow upin ignorance and vice," and then repeats his spirited suggestion, " We must wait V 'Why, Sir, it is this " faith and patience" system which has led to our present condition. It is wonderful that lir. Woodgate should not see that his appalling admission has been actually caused by his pusillanimous remedy. Our "faith" is shaken and our " patience" is exhausted. It is useless for Mr. Woodgate to talk of the progress madein aperiod-" say, 10 years." Let him turn tothe facts. We have had statistical returns as to the state of education only three times-1S15, 1833, and 185L let him consult the figures in those returns, and he will find it demonstrated, as a clear, unanswerable, arithmetical calculation, ihat our educational progress was considerably less in the last cf those two periods than it was in the first. Permnit me, then, Sir, through your widely-circulated colunms, which are daily zead by almost every man in this Icountry who has been educated, to warn Parliament and the public not to be led away by these mistaken statements. Let me warnthenrthat under these fallacies there lurk motives not avowed. 'Why is it that a majority, I fear, of the clergy and a considerable number of the laity are thus bandediogether to imcede any extensive measure for the improvement of education ? The clergy apprehend-most erroneously, as I believethat their spiritual power and influence are at stake; but they have another motive in commnon with the laity; this motive was felt by many and avowed by a few when the education bills were under consideration last year. It may be expressed in these words:-"If this bill passesitwill interfere with my school" This motive will again be at work Let the House of Commons beware of the gentlemen who are thinking only of " my school." All honour to those, be they clerical or lay, who have established "my school -" but no honourto those who would allow their parental tenderness for "my school" to impede arrangements for the welfare of that great majority of our fellow-subjects who constitLte the industrious classes. It wiU ultimately be found, I feel no doubt, that " my school" is not in danger; but, if it is, Parliament must thinlc of all; Shal¢speare says, "Good reasons must of force give place to better." Benefits which are morely local must give place to the general good. A few more days will show whether the House of Comn mons is disposed to act upon these principles. I am san. guine as to the result. The attention ana feelings of the country are roused. The Henleys, and Hadields, and Woodgates may sueoced for a time; but the dayis at hand when sounder viewswl preval and when, ander the auspices of the new' depart. ment, a really national system will be at last adopted. -Im.
