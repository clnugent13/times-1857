|ECOND ED1IMLON. THE TIMES OFFICE, Wuebsky -Morning. THE EAST. (BY s As:TRLg AN-D RraSE TELGRAPH.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- "PAE, WEDNESDAY, JAN. 9, 8.30 A.I. "The Monziteur publishes a despatch fromMlarshal Pelissier, of the 28th of December, announcing that -the volunteers of General d'Autemarre attempted a cowp de main against the Russians, on the night of the 26th of December. " It resulted in 18 Russians killed anua 18 made prisoners, and 20 Cossacks and 30 muskets captured. " No Frenchman was either ldlled or wounded." We have ala6 received the following telegraphic desatch from our Vienna correspondent - " VIENA, TuxsDAY EVENiG, JAN. 8. "Advices from Constantinople of the 31st of December announce that a comnuittee has been formed for investigating the Ears affair." THE WAR IN ASIA. (FROM- OIR oW- cosRsESoNDENT.) TURKISH 4AM", ZIBWI, MINGRELIA, E Nov. 26. The cloudless days and starlight nights which have befriended us hitherto have deserted us just as we had prepared to march, and we are for the present storm-staid in the same village from which I dated my last. The time, however has not been misspent; we have collected a large supply of provisions in d6p6t here, and when we do move we do not expect another halt until we reach Kutais. An opportunity has also been afforded by our stay in one place of gaining further information regarding the sentiment5 of the population upon this invasion of their country. I. have occupied myself a good deal lately in ridingabout to different villages, visiting the natives in their houses, and conversing with them upon their social and political condition; as soon as they are assured that their guest is English and Christian, they freely express their opinions. The idea is firmly rooted in their minds that success on the part of the Turks is the. inevitable precursor of permanent occupation, and they do not hesitate to admit that they dread such a result far more than Russian supremacy-deeming it better to bear the " ills they have than fly to others that they know not of." They listen incredulously to any assurances to the contrary, and ask when they are to expect an 'English or French force, whose presence will alonb relieve them from these suspicions. Thus it happens thatthere is no friendly fee'ingmanifested by the people towrmds the army generally. The villagers look sullen and discontented when a party of fezcapped gentry appear at the doors of their konaks, and are loth to supply them with anything more comforting than a cup of water or a light for a pipe; and so far from our stay in one place having increased their confidence generally, they probably athribute our halt to a fear of meeting the enemy, and assume an even greater indiffereiice to us than before. The 31ingrelians have had less reason to dislike the hfuscovite rule than the inhabitants of most of the Trans-Caucasian provinces, because Russia has not found it either necessary or politic to subject them to the severe treatment which others more immediately in the line of her Eastern progress have met with at her hands. She has deemed it wise to content herself with the right of quartering troops wherever she liked throughout the country, and the Mingrelians have benefitted by the protection which was thus afforded to them from the Circassians. She hbs allowed the revenues of the country to flow partly into the coffers of the Dadian family, partly into those of the principal landholders and slave proprietors, reserving to herself the duties upon imports and exports, and thegeneral cvntrolof the com3ercialrelationsofthecountry. ExceptatRedoutKale she has not attempted to colonize, and although the reigning family is completely underRussian influence that influence is only indirectly felt by the mass of the people. These are divided into three classes1. The Dadians, or reigning family, who are the proprietors of a certain number of villages, and receive from each house three dollars a year, or a certain amount of tribute equivalent to it in kind, and the exclusive service of one member of the family, besides which they receive half-a-dollar a year from every house in the country. 2. The nobles, who own a greater or less number of villages, and receive upon tlle same terms as the Dadians. 3. The serfs; the latter are not exported for sale, but go, as in Russia, with the land. Over each 5,000 of the inhabitants is an officer, called the Natchalhik, wvhose functions are to adjust disputes and administer justice. In the case of murder, the culprit is sent to Siberia; in that of theft, the ownerreceives double the amount stolen, while a fine to the same extent is inflicted for the benefit of the Dadian. In addition to this, the property of all persons dying intestate falls to the Prince reigning. He is also entitled to a certain proportion of military service from the nobles. The Mingrelian rmilitia nulnber 3,500, and were paidt by Russia at the rate of 15 roubles per month per man. The spirit of the population is however more mercantile than military, and it is much to be regretted that the restrictive policy of Russia should have ever exercised its fatal influence upon so fertile a coumtry, where the inhabitants wouild gladly learn to develope resources probably not surpassed in extent and variety in any part of the world. Ahlmostthe sole use which is at present made of the only navigable river in the province, the Rhion, is as a means of conveying contraband goods into the interior. It is to be hoped that one of the results of this war may be to throw open MVlingrelia to commercial enterprise. News has come in that- Mlouravieff has issued a I proclamation- to the Mlahometan population of the frontier Asiatic provinces, warning them to beware of the unholy alliance which Turkey has formed with the Western Powers, and pointing to the present occupation of Constantinople as a reason why they should mistrust the professions of the allies; at the same time he assures them of the sincerity of Russia and the honest protection which she willever afford to her Mussubnan subjects. This piece of diplombacy has, it is said, produced a considerable; effect in those quarters for which it was more specially intended. Nov. 28. e violence of the weather for the last few days has not only rendered any attempt at an advance out of, the question, but has for the time affected our communication withlthe&coast. Some of the temporary bridges which have been thrown over *the. streams where the old bridges were destroyed by theI Russians have been carried away, andthe litle river Ziewie, whichl runs -through the camp, has swollen into an impetuaais torrent, which has rendered the establishment of aw ferry neeesemay. The admirable pontoon'train which follows the aL'my will doubtless prove most valuable in these emergeocies. The day before yesterday three more spies were ohotby order of Omar Pasha. One of them was the aNopted son of Said Bey (Prince Deetri), whois anear relation-oq -Prinue -Mihd -of Aba, -aiid a ajor- Generad in the Rnssia]'z army. Prince Michael himselb has returned t', Shemsernrai from a visit to the Princess Dadiart, who still remains at Gordi, a mountain foerTess about three hours' distance to the right of our hne of march. What policy Her Highness will pursue in the difficult position in which she is placed has not yet transpired. A letter signed by Schamyl has been received byOmarPasha, informing him that he has closed the Russian commiucation by.the Pass of Derbent; as this is the road principally used by the Rusians for reinforcing their Trans-Caucasian army in winter, this manceuvre on the part of Schamyl, if it has been thoroughly effected, is of the uttmost imnportance. We have pushed our reconnaimances as far as the Sceniscal, a large tributary of the RThion, distant about 15 miles from this. In the course of one of these expeditions a party of our cavalry fell im with some Cossacks, whom they succeeded in surrounding, killing one and making two prioners, one of these has, however, since died of his wounds. The | Russians were perceived in force upon the opposite ba'ik of the river, but upon the approach of ourI troops they disappeared, and are supposed defini- tively to have abandoned the position. The Scenis- 1 cal: is a deep river, not fordable where the road crosses it, but said to be passable for horses at some distance both above'and below the ferry. The recent rains, will, however, render any attempt to ford the | river a somewhat hazardous undertaling. Skender, Pasha, with the advanced guard, is at presentposted, four miles distant, on the Ekoura, under a steep hill, crowned by the crumbling wa11s of the romantically situate old castle of Scheth, and about two miles I from the partially deserted town of Sinakhs, which is, after Sugdidi, the most considerable town in Mimgrelia. I rode over to it a few days ago and found that about half a dozen of the more fearless and enterprising inhabitants still remained and kept their shops open, and were driving a profitable trade with forag,ing explorers from the army, who readly pay exorbitant prices for tobacco, potatoes, andvariout other luxuries, their stock of which had latterly been getting low. The weather has much improved during the last 24 hours, and I hope we shaU be in a condition to march in a day or two. THE EAST. (FROM O OWN Co'sroh xi?.) CONSTANTINOPLE, DEC. 31, Your leader of the 13th of November, touching the fall of Kars, has made a very strong impresion in official quarters at Stamboul, especially the passages contained in it with regard to the forced inactivity of Omar Pasha's army through the neglect of the Goverunent at Constantinople. You say, " At this moment Omar Pasha is reduced to inaction by the wants of his commissariat and transport departments." I think it is but fair to all parties to say something about this. The continual capricious changes in the Tirkish Government ara so well known in Europe that it would be scarcely necessary to speak of them; but the evils ensuing from them can scarcely be impressed enough. I will not speak now of the obvious influence of this evil on the general course of affairs, but only of that side of it which regzrds the e-PloYEs themslves. On the one hand these frequent changes practically put an end to all individual responsibility, and this consciousness of impunity gives an additional stimulus to all unprincipled emp?oyis to make the most of their time; while, on the other hand, the collective responsibility which places the faults and crimes of one Administration on the shoulders of the other, iieighs very heavily on the conscientious Minister, who has to answer for the guilt of others. Be has always the fate of L-ouis X2V. before him. The present Turkish Ministry is more especially in this unenviable position. The destitution and banishment of Mehemet Ali Pasha, the Sultan's brother-in-law, an unprincipled, and, what is perhaps worse in this case, an incapable man, was the beginning of a series of Court intrigues, having for their sole purpose the recal and employment of this gentleman. Europe and Asia, Kars and Erzeroum, were f6rgotten in this struggle and rivalry between the Court clique and the Government. We see every day in Europe, even in the freest countries, what a well organized and active evtoura9e of the Sovereign is able to do -, how much more must this be the case in an Oriental state, framed after the worse traditions of the Lower and the old Persian Empires, where the monarch is a kind of demi-god, only to be approached by those immediately around hi-. Thus the existence of the former Ministry after the banislunent of Mehemet Ali was a life and death struggle, with the secret influences working in his favour. General Williams wrote about the pitiable state of the Asiatic army and was not heeded-the Turlish army in the Crimea was living on the charity of the allies, without getting anything but promises from those whose duty it was to look after it. At last Court influence triumphed, the unfortunate Ministry was upset, fehemet Ali recalled, and the present Ministry formed. But by this time things in Asia had likewise come to a crisis, and Kars was invested. Mehemet Ruchdi Pasha became Seraslder. He found the Turkish Danubian army broken up, the Crimean army in rags, the army at Kars shut up with scanty provisions, a few thousand rabble at Erzeroum, a revolt in aurdistan, and the first loan exhausted. Most men would have broken down under such a weight, but MehemetRuchdi Pasha in not only an honest man, against whose character not even envy dares to brthe a suspicion, but likewise an energetic man, as you may conclude from the fact that he entered the army as a simple soldier, and won his rank, not at Constantinople, but with the army, and moreover educated himself during this time, so that this man who, when he entered, could neither read nor write, now speaks very fair French, and is numbered among the mbst prominent literary men of his country. His first step, when he came into office, was to put an end to the intrigues which threatened to choke the TurKish Contingent in its cradle, and thus I to give reality to that until then rather mythical body. He collected the shattered remains of the Danubian army, and sent reinforcement after reinforcement to Erzeroum, so that now more than 15,000 maen are assembled there, besides the Egyptian brigade from Eupatoria. iOmarPfasha was recalled from the Crimea and jintrested with a division for the. relief of Ears. Before he moved troops were sent from Varna to Batoum. As the allies could give no transports for .theTurikish troops, 18 English stemers were hired ,for that purpose, and for supplying the Turkish *aray min Georgia. The troops, who had received no. wwinter clothing last year; were provided with it this *yeara iiottl sooner than 'iusual. Arabas were construted expressly for the transport service .of OmarPas}ha's army and dra'ught animas sent with them. That the means of transport are not wanting appers from the movement of the Turldsh army in Georgia. Omar Pasha chowethe'longeit road to go to. Kutais, and yet he nearly reached Kutais, and made a march of 70 miles, which, surely, without means'of transport he could not have done. Nor can there have been a want of provisions, for one of the main reasons which was given for the downes of-advanoe of the damy in Georgia was the ne3essity,of forming depot on ,te -rod,-in oid4r not t De depasdsnt on Suchui 3 eb, and depots c4not be formed without A Teady sUIpply -of provisions at hand: ' Pmar lsha received besides a round sum of ready 'money, that lie might b'e m'ore indepeideiit' and piepared for emergencies. '' - However guilty the former Government might have been in allowing things to come to such a point in Asia, the present one certainly didits best to remedy the evils, and was anxious to do everything iu order not to begin its rule with the fall of Krs.. It gave therefore to Onar Pasha not only what he asked for ixmen and supplies, but allowedhim likewise the greatest freedom of action, providedahekept inview the object of the expedition, namely,therelief of Ran. According. to the suggestion of General Willias, Batoum was selected as the base of operations, but Omar Pasha was left at liberty to operate directly on lKras or Gumri or on Kutais.' If hc chose this latter, having a ful knowledge of his means, and did not succeed, he must bear the responsibility of this step. * aving found affairs in such a wretched state, it became: a matter of honour, interest, and amoutrpropre for the Government not to darken this victo& rious year by a defeat,-ind it was ready to submit to any sacrifices to obtain this aim. The loan commission is still busy with defining its own position. In theory nothing can be fairer than that the allied Governments who took upon themselves to guarantee the new loan should have the right to control the spending of it; but practically it is exceedingly difficult to keep the juste mileu, so as not to overlook the object of the commission, and on the other hand not to meddle too miuch with details. It becomes, therefore, essential to determine from the beginning the exact position of the controlling body, or else diffliculties would be ui;voidable in such a delcate transaction. * I hear there are two projects proposed; one comniig from the commision itself would constitute the commission intoan independent body, exercising as such a control over all contracts and other expenses to be defrayed by the prceeeds of the loan; the other project,emanatingfromtheTurkishGovernment, proposes that an English and French member of the Commssion should form part iu the Counile to which all tenders must be presented. It is difficult to give an opinion in such a delicate matter, but the plan seems to be preferable which establishes the form of control in the mildest form, especialy as the Turldsh Government gratefully acknowledging the subvention of the Allies appears anxious to show its willingness to unravel the hitherto unknown mysteries of Turkish finance. There would be a good deal to say about the first budget of the Ottoman Empire, but I must keep I any remarks about it for my next letter, for fear of encroaching too much on your space. I shall only say on this occasion that the difficulties between the Government and the Conmission seem to be mainly arising froia the different interpretations of the proposal for effecting the payments in the manner proposed at the end of the report; News has arrived to-day from Erzeroum and Trbizond, and letters have been received from General Williams. He had left the Russian camp at Kars on the 30th of November, and had arrived at Gumri the next day. He is in goodhealth, and is courteousy treated by the Russians. ' In Trebizond as well as Erzeroum reinforcements are daily arriving, a good many Egyptians from Enpatoria among the number. The dif(culties between the Persian Govermnent and the British mission seem as yet nlot only not aranged, but, if the news from Erzeroum are to be believed, they have reached such a point that Mr. Murray has demanded his passports. This wants confirmation, for it is scarcelycredible that a collision of such a trifing character as that which gave rise to the wihole quarrel, and which I mentioned- some time ago, should have led to sucli serious results. Of local news there is nothing striking. Councils of war and sittings of the Committee of Inquiry into thle affairs of Anatolia, and more especially of Kars, are still the order of- the day, but are much disturbed by the Christmas and New Year's gaieties of the Pera population. - On Saturday last M. Thouvenel went in great state to the Palace of Tcheragan, to present to HIis MIaiesty the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Legion. of Honour, and an autograph letter from thTe Emperor Napoleon. M. Thouvenel, in his speech to the' Sultan, a1ludes to the sentiments of high esteem and sincere attachment which the Emperor Napoleon entertains for the Sultan, and concludes by saying that these insignia are a new pledge of the memorable alliance, &c. The -les Jager battalion of the German Legion was revieived on Friday last by General Storks, and the appearance as well as the disclpline of the men have been most satisfactory. The GermanLegion atHululee, thanks to the care of Brigadier-General Woollidge, are getting on remarkably well, scarcely a case of drunkenness or. punishment required, and scarcely ever a man absent from parade. Christmas-eve, a day perhaps more generaly kept in Germany than in England, was kept likewise by the German Legion. The few men still remaining in the barack hospital had a Christmas tree arranged for them by -Dr. Pincopp and his-lady, while their comrades at Kululee kept the day on a larger scale. They decorated their barracks with evergreens; illuminated them most tastefully, and ornamented them with elegant transparencies and appropriate mottoes. General Woolridge was then invited, and when he appeared was received by the men with cheers; the senior Sergeant-MIajor stepped forward and made an appTopriatespeech, expressing in the name of his comrades the gratitude they felt for the kind feel1 in,s expressedintheGeneral's orderof the day, ending with a promise to endure with pleasure and perseverance the hardships -which they may be called upon to endure during the ensuing campaign, under the auspices of the General, their leader and friend, and shouts of " God save our Queen." Letters from Kertch confirm the news published in the Journal de Con-stantinople some time ago, which I gave you. The affair took place on the 16th, and the particulars are as follow .-There is a farm about seven miles from Kertch, called the Spanish farm, where there was a quantity of hay stacked, and this having been, bought by the Commissariat, Major Mlacdonald, commanding the 1st Regimentof the ContingentCavalry,was sent outwith a party of cavalry and infantry to defend it. His orders were to send 'out patrols all over the country in the immediate vicinity, for fear the Cossaeks should attack the - farm. On Sunday, the 16th, - Major Macdonald having been told that there were Cossacks seen some short time before, took oat a party of 84 men, and,' with Captain Sherwood,-went out at 8 a.m. at a brisk pace. They seem; not to have taken the necessary precautions-they were without advance or rear guards. - They must have gone about 16 miles when they saw a small body of Cossaeksin 'front. - They iimmediately,pursued- the Cossacks,- who were 'retreating% until suddenly they found a large body of 200 or 300 in their rear. This was at 2 p.m.- They I immnediately tried to cut their way throug, and in doing s6 Captain Sherwood, the Yuzbasli (Cptain), and 37 men were kIlled or made prisoners. 'Major Macdonald, and those remaining withbi'n, returned at sunset: the'men' ha their.new Bwords,-which, never having been sharpened, were blunt afid would :not cut. , ,- However faulty Majoi MNacdoniald may hve been in isA rach advance, his retreat was so galant that it rseau is conduct up to a ertain point. - The foewingor~'the day after, Glener Wivian sent Major Ooldiniith with a fladof trace. He has retsrrned, and states that Captain Sherwood, the Xluzba1- and three- others had lied, and the remainder were piisone'rs; some being wounded. 'The Russians told him ithat they bad had the usual single Cossack killed, and three slightly wounded. Everybody agrees, ever, the RUs , that the Turks behaved admirably. The Tuibashi and another was kdlled on the fielEl. Captain Sherwood and two others died of their wounds. When the former fell he said to Mfajor Macdonald, "Tell the General I died doing my duty to my country." He is a great loss, having been a great favonrite with the Turks, and could speak.Turkish; he was besides a favourite with everybody else. -The letters from Kertch reaching to the 22d of "this month speak of great eold; three days before the thermometer fell to 3 deg. on board ship. The bay is frozen over, and people are going to and fro on the ice to the ships. There is a little snow, but not much. It is very fortunate that the men are huttedL EXPRESS FROM PARIS.- The following, is the Ietter of our Pais correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.: Onthe strength of a paragraph in aDresden paper announcing the receipt of a despatch fromSt. Petesburg, which expresses a rather vague hope of Russia not giving an entirely unfavourable answer to the Austrian propositions, rumours of a pacific solution were afloat here last evening and a part of this day. What real grounds there are for -the hope I am at this moment unable to say ; the ann'ouncement is of too vague a kind to deserve much credit, thozugh it is not improbabie - that Russia will refrain from giving a complete and peremptory refusal in the hope of gaining time.; - It has been repeated over and over again that if. Prnssia spoke in a tone becoming the rank she pretends to hold in Europe there would be very littile doubt of the result, and whatever favourable inferences may be deduced from the fact, it is certain that Baron de Werther, who represents the Ying at, St. Petersburg, has, as f believe Imentioned on Sunday, given, and still gives, excellent advice, so far as it goes, to M de NesseLjode, and to al appearances warmly, and it may be sinceyrely-supports M. Esterhazy, who in the event of the rejection of the propositions, or in the absence of ananswerof anykind, has received instructions to return to Vienna on the 16th of the present month. Another symptom, which ought to be favourable, is, that Russians of the highest class, both at Berlin and Vienna, are known to speak in strong terms against the Prussian Cabinet. This, however, may be hypocrisy, and the Austrian Ambassador here is said to express himself in a satisfactory manner of the mission of Colonel 3lanteuffeL But whatever be the chances of peace or of war, the inglish and French Governments appear determined to allow no time to be lost, and I believe'that even w - vewere negotiations opened our militar preparations would not be affected in any degree. The energetic attitude assumed lately by Austria ought naturally to lead to the conclusion that when the time comes Austria *ill intervenie otherwise than by means of her diplomacy; and consequently tha French and English Ministers at Vienna have been istructed to confer with x de Buol on the step she will next take in the event of her propositions being rejected, or of no answer being returned by Russia. M. HIibner is said to have recently stated that the Austrian army in the Principalities, the Banat of Temesvar, and Transylvania, amounts to over 80,000 men. The' following letter, said to come from St. Petersburg, and dated the 30th of December, has been received "Since the arival of Count Esterhazy, on the 26th, several conferences have taken place. The Count caled frst on JL de Nesselrode, nnd the following morning M. de Seniavine paid avisit to tho-Austrian finister. We are all cnrious to know what wil be. the resait of this new step on the partl of Austria; but the more violent will not give ciedit to the rumours of concessions whichicertain high personages seem disposea to make. The Adlerberg the Orloffs, and the Mfensbhikoffs (the latter thinks he may postpone his departure for Cronstadt) attend every day in the Cabinet of the Emperor, who generally receives them in company with his brothers. "The Grand Dlke Michael is occupied with the superintendence of the preprations for strengthening the fortifications on the coast of Finland. Count Nesselrode often sees the Grand Duke Constantine, and it is said that the harmony which now appears to exist between the parties which divide the Courtis due to theinfluence ofthe Empress Marie and to that of the sister of the late Emperor. "I would not discourage those who are buoyed up with hopes of peace, yet I must say that, in the opinion of persons whom I know to be well informed,we are stil far from being agreed on the essential points. In the eyes of Russia, the Black Sea is essentiaDy a Russian lake, and she considers it an immense concession to admit Turkey, though with territory on its coast, to discu!p the conditions of the protection of that coast and to participate in it. As to the painciple of the mare clautume I am assured she will never give it up. For some weeks past the Emperor is much occapied -with the troops and horses destined to complete the cavalry divisions of the guard. The Grand Duk-es :icholas and Michael frequently visit ths batteries of the Neva. The fortifications from Oranienbaum to St. Petersburg on one side, and from Isi Noss to the capital on the other,will soon bristle -with mortars of an enormous calibre." The Joinmcl de Et. Petersbou-rg of this day contains au obituary notice on General Destrem, who was formerly a pupil of the Polytechnic School of Paris, and who was sent to St. Petersburg in 1810, with three other French officers, in order toform the nucleus of the neur Institute of Fonts et Chaussees and public buildings. General Destrem was the constructor of Cronstadt, and of the pont Nicholas, between Fnland and Russia. Thus, as Sebastopol was constructed by an Englishmai, the fortress which is the key to St. Petersburg'was built by a Frenchman. The death of General D'estrem is regarded by more than one Russian as a bad omen. It is not withoT±t a' certain meaning that the AbeiWe ds Nord gives to-day, under a dramatic forna, the description of a solemn national fete which took plce in 1814, and in which Alexander L. was put forth as the saver of Europe, Europe being represented by a female who fings herself: in the arms of hiin who savedher. The same jounal informsus that the Emperor thanks the nobiity of Esthonia for the 12,000 routles they have contributed to improve the food of the troops in that province. In order that you should the better appreciate the importance of the publication and the gift, you must.bear in mind that these troops belong in great part to the Imperial Guard, which is the best fed corps in the'service. What then is' the sort of food given to the troops of the line in garrison 100 leagues from the capitalt. . An, eye-witness Mnentioned to- me the followingfa,t :-Wblle -pasing the iast sum er .at Iiga at aperson's house -in which 10 soldiers were billeted, iwho were' employed on thc woits of the fortress, we heard one day: one of these 'men offering his ration of zweetmeats forsale;- Theoffer was mcersied with laughter at the idea of such delicacies being furighe-d io the: s:oldier- by tha Govmente;t- The sbidier wasdesired to'show, and inifolding his mnilitary'eloak-he exhibited to the' eyes 'ofall a piece of bread as black, and - nixedwitashessnds,and, and said, rncli,'Hr aretmy wts-4h6 xwereet ts'thatire `givenalo ns."

There being no possibility of savig her, she was.removed to some distance from the other shipping, where sh6 continued to burn until 3 o'clock a.m., when she sank. The Themis had on board 50,000projectile., 3,000,000 of ball cartridges, and a number of barrol of gunpowder. The Russians continued- to occupy. the same positions in the neiglbourhood. The Egyptian Division had embarked, with the exeeption of 2,300 men, most of whom were sick, the climate disagreeing -with them. The hiip of theline Jupiter rTived at Toulon oz the 6th inst., coming from the Black Sea, and on the same day thesteamcorvette DAssnereturne to Brest, from the E3itic. - The Mfoni u,- de hi Ftlot publishes the follog, dated Kamieech, 25th ult.:- "The steai corvette Pblegeton, Captain Russel, sent to Kinbum with provisions for thLe gazxison, hasjust returne from that place, which she left four days ao. The Dnieper froze this year earlier thaDn -uua, and this prematu frost was followed by- r, fist brisking up of the icc, which, thanks to the excellent- neasuier adopted, occasioneda us no damage. Some d&ys afterwards the rivez froze again, the cold continuing daily. to increaeand the ice nowmewres from1A to 3 feet in thickness. The centigde thermuneter Tepeatealy fell to 24& .dbelow ' the freezing point. In that position our soldiers ind sailors want for nothing. They are provided withexcellent sheep.' alin clothing, plenty of wood for fael, and abundance oE food. The garrson is full of ardour, and most anxious to measure itsef with the enemy. Reports had reacbed from different quarters that the Russian intended to attack Kinburn in the night of the 22d. A great )novement oftroops was even remarked dozing the day on the side of Oce7akoff, and it was beBeie.ed that a portion of their foroem wonld cross over on the ice. Captain Paris, the superior - commander, had taken the neceSaSRy meures to pel them, but they did not present themselves. and, whenever they think properto do so, they will .find us on our guiiarda4 ready to receive tbem- The ships of war occupy excelen, positions. The whole of the wostern part of the isthmnus, from the entrenched fosse, situate in advance of the village, iscommanded bythe oating batteries, and the enemy wouk. be obliged to pass mnder the 'fire of their artillery, which completely sweeps T&e neck of land, about 900 yards wide at that point. The Russians are greatly anaoyed at the occupa tion by the allies of the mouth of the Dnieper, from whence we keep a close wat-h npoi the importa'ht positions of Nicholaieff, Cherson, and OczLklofL. The Phlegeton, oIquitting Kinburn, to return to Kamiesch, had to nake her way, during three hours, through fioeting ice from { to 10 inches in thickness. Assailed afterwards by the fout weather of the-winter equinox, which was most violent tbh&year in the Black Sea, the was obliged to lie to 'dring two' days before she could proceed on her voyage, which s:le safely effected." A letter from Sebar*opol, in the Ga2etzt 1u Midi, says:- - One of my comrades of the 95th. of the line, vrho beI longs to the garrison of the fort taken from the Russians, has written me a letter, in which I find an anecdote reia tive to the French oflfiders mnade prisoners by the Russianat Xinburn while out on a shooting excursion. The'prisoners were taken to lNichblaieff, but kept outside the town,- probably to prevent their seeing the state- o the fortifcations. The- Emperor Alexander- hd juts arrived there. On learning that --some French ofcers had been captured, the- Czar ordered one of them to be presented to him. The' Czar conversed fanilisajy with him, spealding very -lindly- and asked him mans questions rdating to the war, aioling, however, Iia emharassing subject& . On dimaisIng him he shook him by the hiiuand asid, ' I give y a hd Waichh w03on, I hope,p be a friendly one.' I heerily vsl the prediction may be accomplished; but I think Alexander IL, though anEm. peror, is mot a prophet in his own land." - The foElowing private telegraphic despatches hLae been received a- * . ~ ~~MAP* EIL38,Dym 7.

Among them were six members of the Inst tute. Two speeches, one -by M. Halevyj the sculptor, brother to the well-known composer, the other by Md. Etex-were delivered at the grave. They were not of a political chcter, and merely referred to the talents of the deceased as an artist. A good many stucdents were present. . Wranger, the poet, attended the ceremony.

MONY-MARKiETand CITY INTELLGEYCB. Tuesday Evening. 'She quotation of gold at Paris is about 4-per nuille premium (according to the last tariff), which, -atthe EngEish Mint price of 3. 17s. l(d. per oz. for standard gold, gives an exchange of 20.27; and, thei~ exchange, at Paris on London at short being i.3o; t follows that gold is about 0.12 per cent. 'deaixer ill London than in Paris. - z By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is '425 'er mark, which, at the English -int price of 4W. 17s. 10cd pef oz. for standard gold, gives an ex*change of 13.4fi; and, the exchange at Hamburg -osi Lonidon at short being 13.5J, it follows that gola i`0.23 per cent, dearer in London than in Hamburg. ;:The EngEsh funds opened with greater steadiness -{hs morning, but the improvement was only temporar,'and the -market closed at a furtherdecline. osnd 'with an app)earance o£ heaviness which eon- Lderab1y. increased £fter regular hours. . Consols, ivhich left offyesterday at 8633- to J, were first quoted to S7, but some speculative sales soon caused a teaction to-86' to t. From this there was an improvement of an eighth, but it was not mainVsinex, and the last official price was 86- to ; while at a later hour adverse operations fere 'c'ntinued until a decline took place to 86M. Y?of the F'ebruary account the ultimate quotafCon was 8&1 to 87. The fluctations of the *-day were partly attributable to the preparations iork the settlement of the account on the 10th inst., i1?ut the greater steadiness at the commencement was --created by-less unsatisfactory quotations 'from the Iaris Bourse and the circulation of rumours regardihg the progress of the peace negotiations. , At a later period the character of these'rumours appeared -tF change, and, the telegrapl having shown a -renewed fall in'the French funds, the general tone ,ok the market became extremely weak. MIoney was in. good demand at 5 per cent. in the Stock-Ex-cliange, and out of doors the existing rates were fllly, maintained, the impression being that the _-a'pproaching payment of the dividends will exercise little permanent influence. Bank Stock left off at 2061 to 207;; Reduced, 86i to ;; New Three per -exenis., 97i to i; India 9tock, 221 to 223; Ex:chequer-bonds, WI' to g; and India Bonds and Eix'chequer-bills, 9s. to 4s. discount. ,Foreign securities 'vere steady, with a moderate -anomut of business. There was less firmness at the close,- a -revival of speculative sales having taken p1ace. In Turkish Six per Cents. the operations for the account were at 8UL, 81i, 8Wl, and J. The dtiaranteed Four per Cent. Scrip was negotiated at -4ind3Z-, aud the final quotation was 4 to 3S dis-. -c6unt; The general transactions comprised-Mexi--cs 192 .and i; Portuguese Four per Cents., for .-aqeount, 45; Russian Five per Cents., 95; the Xur-and-a-Italf per Cents., 86; Spanish New De. -.ierred, for account, 21 and ; Spanish Certficates, -4j; Venezuela. 252; Duteh Two-and-a-Half per --Cents., 63fand $; and the Four per Cent. Certi-fieates, 94.S and. ln the'foreign exchanges this afternoon bills upon Paris and Amsterdam were much offered, and there -W35 a further advance in the rates. Hambug, on the contrary, was a shade lower than last post. WiVth regard to other places there was no alteration -of-importance. She last quotations of the French Three per C#ntg. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 62f. 85c., for money, and G3f. for the end of the mointh, showuinga fall of nearly @ per cent. 'The expectation of moderate specie arrivals from America continues to be realized, and the Baltic toiday has brought 60,0001. The whole of this hakever, will doubtess be sent to France. The recent- arrival of silver from Mexico appears to 1hve been rmore than adequate to the demand for - thO East, and it is thought some portion of it may find its- 'ay to the continent and produce a benefield effect on the exchanges. 'he suspesision of Messrs. George Greig and Co., unthe Cape trade, has been announced. The ;aount of their liabilities is supposed to be about 25,000!.. Liverpool letters mention, with regard to the estate of Mr. Edward Oliver, the value of which has now been tested bythe lapse of 15 months from - the date of 'his failure, that the unfavourable anti- cipations originally expressed will be confirmed. A dividend of 2s. 6d. in the pound has been paid, but, --although the improved state of the market for -21pping has helped materially to augment a portion of the assets, there is, it is said, little ground to hope for any great change in the ultimate results, sice the advantage thus gained has been neutralized by drawbacks in other respects. The ship Zetland, from which large sums were expected to be realized, has made a most tedious and disastrous voyage. ShesailedfromChinatoChili withemigrants, and-it was estimated by some persons that with her earnings she would be worth 30,000!. She met, however, with bad weather, suffered severely, and -lost-300 of her passengers. The amount now anti* cipvted from her is therefore small. It is also -aieOed that :30,0001. was calculated to accrue from anostherclaim which has since assumed an appear-ance as if it would end as a total loss. Itis stated that the estate of Messrs. Palmer and - Grene, of the Lichfield Bank, will prove less un. satisfactory than had been anticipated, and that a realization of 12s. 6d. in the pound is considered prohable. The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Botterdam produce-mark-ets state that business - continued inactive, but that quotations had been generally well supported. The letters from Rouen mnentiona slight recovery in some branches of mannfactiares. The Bank of Pnrssia is stated to have raised its -r'ate of discount from 43. to 5 per cent. Advices from Haytf of the 10th of December furnish the proclamation of the EmperorSoulouque, - calling upon the country to join him in establishing his ,way over the entire island. On the day of its appearance the French and English representatives at Port-au-Prince protested against the hostile movement against St. Domingo, but he merely acknb*ledged their communication, and announced his determination to leave for that part of the island --on the 12th, to follow his army, which had already comrcnced its departure. T,it amount paid into the treasury of the East Ixdi6-housd for bills on India from the 23d of Dezmntertci the 8th inst., is 1'26,4581. The subjoined annual report on the tea-market is from MEessrs. W. J. and Henry Thompson .- " ji reviewing the corse of the tea-market during the past vear the most striking feature to notice is the extent - of bAth isDorts and deliveries. Notvwithstanding the in- creased tro esat Canton, leading to an alno total suspension 6f business at that port for some months-the heavy decliev in n'early all descriptions here, and the great losses sustauied'lastyear-the increasing value of money, and the ligh jnces paid for silver remittances, causing all funds- to be lkd do"n at a great disadvantage-such was the activity of the new port of Foo Chow, and the confidence in this mnarket:still entertained at Shanghai, that the result has 5een Fe have -received the largest import ever knownnamely, an excess of 6,000,0001b. over 184, and 23,000,0001h. -above the average of thefive previous years The deliveries -alo, il,ich, soar as regards home consumption, itmighthave been supieposed would hare been checle , if not lessened, ,by thearirgety increased cost of all articles of prime necessity -and,_-kewse by the additional duty-:-have, on the conrary,,steadily increased, and give a surplus over last yeardUip*ards of 3, 00,0001b., and over the average of the jive pfeviots yeals of ne'arlyll,000,CC01b. - while the export (stimulated- by an immense and unnlooke for demand for 'he BAtio-ports) shows the astonishing result of 6,000,oOlb. dncreae aoboveo last year, and nearly 10,000,O001b. over the average of the five previous years.

"'On reference to the table on the third 'ae it will be observed that the imports into the unitel ki.Adom have been 84,800,0001b. against 78,700,0001b. in 1854; the deliveries for home conrsnmption, 64,500,0001b. against 61,200,000'.h in 1854; the deliveries for exportation, ; 15,0C0,001b. against 9,000,000Tb. in; 1854- -the stock remaking on the 31st of December was 70,50i,0001b. against 65,200 lb.in 1854 - "Thus the- aggregate- deliveries show- an increase of 9,250,0001b. over last year-about 3,250,0001b. being actual increase in consumption, and the other 6,000,0001b. the surplus export. "The imports have exceeded those of the previous year by about 6,000,0001b.; or above 5,000,0001b. beyond our largel{ increased delivery. sthough in excess o last year by upiwards of 5,000,0001,contrasts favourablywhen the increasein the deliveries -is considered, and is materially- less than it has been doria" several'periods of the present year." The fo3lowfing on the present state of the wine trade is from Messrs. MIartinez, Gassiot - and Co. - " The sberry- vmiitage of last year was very shortin quantity, and the disease in the vine appeared - in many of the vineyards; that of the Alto Douro is probably the most disastrous on record, for not only was the produce-less than one-fourth of the usual quantity, but the quality is so bad that very few of the wvines are li for importation. "Tghe great increase ic the prices of port wine has entirely arisen from the partial failure of the two vintages of 1853 and 1854(althongh the latter produced ine overy ne gnality) andithe almost total exctinction of tat of 1855. Suhan advance could not, howrever, have taken place in an article in which there is so much competition had those large reserved stocks of old wines, so often alluded to by writers, existed in Portugal; the falLacy of the statements that have been often made on this subject is now too severely felt by those who may have relied on themf for their sup p les. We have no desire to exarggerate the difficulties under wihich many of the trade are nowf suffering from the great increase in the cost of port wvine, but wre offer the following sug,gestions for the onsideration of our correspon. "The wine merchant of this country must be governed in his purchases by the nature of his own trade; if his customers are content to buy the common red wine of Portugal, much of which (since the old restrictions have been evaded) is nowv shipped direct from Oporto, or even that of Spain, Italy, and Frace, in lieu of the produce 'of the Alto CDonro, he will be, enabled to supply-his ;liends. at low er prices, but fine port wine is of sosdistinctive'a character that w e believe for such there wll always be found a Semaniat oven some considerable advance on the present quotations. We ground this opinion on the fact that in 1812 the common selling price of port wines to the trade wasl2. to 130. per pipe, duty paid. We do not mean that with the present rate of duty there is any immediate prospectof prices advancing to this extent, but if there should be a continuation of short vintages it is not altogether impossible, and all wve contend is, that even at those prices consumers would be found in this country for such wine." The Mexican dollars brought by the steameriwhich arrived last Friday have been disposed of to-day at 59id. per ounce, and only a small proportidn has been taken for shipment to India and China. The price realized for the dollars by the previous packet was 600d., and in some instances higher rates have since beenobtained;but, consideringthelargeamount in the market, the present rate is somewhat higher than might have been anticipated. The bar silver has been sold at ClAd, per ounce, showing a decline of 44. -_ _

In yarns the quietness is not so uififoim. sBuyers report in some cases that they have obtained twist at rather easier prices, but selleTs have in sonme instances done a fair business,, and in low numberrs rathei better prices have been - obtained. The general report is one of quietness, with steady prices.

Jhn Saggand Co. report..-,,There is no n ew feature in the mEarkegtto-day. Transactions ontinue to be on a very small scale, and prices are unchanged." - Th woollen clthmnarket LEEDS, J&. 8. - T ollh lohmre tsh morning have beenarkm%Led by theseme cheerfnl tone that we have had to p-it out as the chlarcteristic of the last two or threo m2k-etl. There has-been a fairmnount of cloth,. inmluding-the middle and .better qualities, as well as those of a commioner k-ind, sold. MIeFchants appear to be repleuishing' their stocks for the sprin trade. Psises are firm, and have slightly improved for the all-wool sorts of fabrics. -The price of tEeraw inaterial (wool) is veryfirm, with an-upward tendency. The manufacturers throughout this district are gradually increasing their work, giving employment to more hands or xnninglonger time, so that the year opens wrell fdr the operativeas well as for the master manufacturer. In some of the outlyIng towns of this district a good amount of work is doing for -ariy atid navy orders, and in the more imnmediate neighbourhood of Leeds"some extensive orders for S h stripes and other fabries for the EastIndies and 40 nnahaie een given-out. - The Leede In1euiQencer'of this mornin- thus speals of the present position and prospects of the woo'len trade- "Trade continaesto show an mpro-ed tone, and several lare London buyers' have been down dorin the week, nsakrugpuchases chiefly in anticpation of the sring demand. ln the warehouses geierally there is more doing for the home trade, andtheAmeriam orders are double those of last year. The hall markets show little alteration bat the stocL-s on hand do not mulate to any large extend Mannfacturers- ae remarkablywell emyioye, and hare large erders-on hand. Now that the accounts of 1855 aie strained, and balances are struck, the amount of busi aess which has been trans3cted at a reniuerative profit is most extraordinary, and the woollen trade is another exam ple of the slight influence which the-war has had on thecomn- merceofthecountry. Withmaanythepastyearhas beenbetter: hin he precefig;, a;nd :fthegrossreturs haveinmost instances been smaller, the absence of heavy losses, asin 1854 must be considered asacompensation. It is an open question whether, taking the trade as a whole, it has not been bene.fitted rather than injured by the -war, and whether the advantages of large Government and foreign contracts have not outweighed any evils arising from monetary pressure and a - contractedhome trade. Normust the latter feature be laid altogether to the account of the -war. A severe checkv was certain to follow the reckless overtrading 'of the last few years, and if it had been fmuther delayed the reaction would have been all the more violent when it did come. Present prospects are good: The foreign trade suffers no int . tiun; the colonial markets are no longer choked w ith to: -and are returning toa more healthy state; at home stocks of evsrydescription are light, both in the wholesale and retail trade. There is a general determination o thepart of the merchats to act cautiously, and on the part of the manufacturers to work- only to order." In reference to another point of our staple trade, we copythe following from another article in the same journal :- " The-American market at present is that which offers the most probable continuance of employment genetaIy - for the condition of the continent of Europe may be so changed in a commercial point of view thFs year, in con*equence of the war, that we may hardly know what reliance to place upon its custom. And, in fact, in many -artsof itourtradelhas declinedsomuchof late yearsthat we seezm to have less and less to expect theice, without even reference to the war. Austria, for instance, in whose territories there was a gradual falling off of trade with this country between 146 'and 1852 of 7 per cent., exhibits a specific falling offinwoollen, w°orstoed, hel3ery, and small wares between 1852 and 1854 of not less than-13 per c4dut.; --while zhe hasincreased the declaredvalue of her purchases of .steam-enoseandmachineryiunthesamoetwoyearseqnaltol91 pe ocent. Weolool;nupon this increase as significant of the fact that her pulation is becomn employed ont te fact itnob on English mac ery, m weaving sch as she'used to buy; and that, as coming ev-ents cast theirshadows before, so our manufacturers are to learn from it that some of the old-mark-ets for English goods are ikely to be narrowed rather than widened; and that others mast be sought among populations less settled, and therefore less capable of turning their attention to the arts of peace. If there is much competition among the manufacturers between now and May vool wiiU hecessarilybe dearer. If thatcompetition- be legitimate the prices of goods will rise. We are thanldul to see the very great caution which the manufacturers, as a body, are displaying; and the end of it will be that, if large fortunes are not made so- fast, they will be the more safely kept when they are mide." -; aUDDER SFIELD, JAeN, 8.

THEEASTERN-COfTMES 4AIZWA. , * T TOHE EDITOT OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Three communications on the affairs of this com; pany-have appeared in 27he 2nzes and other journals, to which I venture to ask your permission to reply... - The first is from Mr. Edward BalL br.Bal} (it is obvious f-om his letter). finds,that, after my answer to It, the report of the committee of inrvestigation can no 'longer bg maintained. He therefore asks the shareholders'ef' the Eastern Counties to read, nothis -"rep6rt," hut tha 6,.evidence. I have no objection. But before the sharehiodara begin to read the evidence it is right they should kinowi tht the evidence is. In' a recent article you observed very naturaly that.the evidence as reported 'was extordihary. That is not surprising. For the fact is that the -oimiatteea -of investigation nrever reported the evidence at a1; they simply gave their own notes of it after the fashion. which best suited their own pmposes Mr. -Berrkeley, the- engi neez,-has alre:dy,'in your columns, publicly erposed the mis&reports of the evidence he gave. They were, however, .pezrsitein, despite his renoonstrances.' Er. Moseley,i the traffic nanaget of the line, has addresseda letlert-me which shows that the committee put a mis-statementintb his mouthba,ginst his r;lP, and kept' it' 'tEefe notwitliitinding his correction of their proof. And another officer of tha -coinpanyhas Stat thatthe evidence'he was feady to give the committee refused to hear, and the reason o1riously wag because it did not suit thepurposes of the report. Every one, therfofre, who zeads the vi'ience must tak Ait with the 'reservation that it is reportidin a manner wholly unreliabler -ttit cltuonveys, not the words or the viev;s of thewitnesses, but the words and views of the committee. * With respect tq the letter of Mr. Ibghtly Simpfsinu, if prbof were needed that the secret of the present controv?rsy is to be found in East lAnglian efforts to extract revenue from the Eastern Counties tiaffic, that letter would-arnply supply it. Xosooner did the East Angliani nterestSn& theniielves secure, in'coiisequence of the cosimittees iftervention; than .Mr. ? Siupsen 'states th%y airnie4 out the -resolution respecting traffic which 'I- had arrested, and have thereby perilled the -inland coal trade, fron which 4thc Eastetnm Counties. shareholders derive ar income of 85,0001. a-year. But I have to charge hEr. Simpson - ith maisquoting and misusing my reply. 'i I bis letter he says Mr. Waddington states in the condliding part of his charge againht the-T1ast Anglian directors-'that the interests of the Eastern CountiesandtheEastAzgflar in direct opposition, and that the covert object is to transfer the Eastern Counties dividends to the East Anglia q shire. holders."' NoW, in no part of my anslIer is there such a sentence as this. It is untrue that I have stated in any formn of laniuage that "the interests of theEAstern Counties'and-the East Anglian are in direct opposition."! rOn the contrary, at page 8 I have described the tdrms "of tlUeir rdations "as not unfav.o'able, though they involve the principlJof payug a tollIfo itlltri opasedupon that (the East Anglian) line' and this is not the only exanpleSof misquoting that may be found in Mr. Simp3on's letter. The committed and their friends, in fact, appear inclined to deal 'eith tany answer as they.deal vwith the evidernce. . L : Thereport of the Government inspector, published-ii Monday's 27mv,. .does not come -upon me with mruch at. prise. After the proceedigs of the committee nothingshort of the interference of Governmient inspector could have bete looXcedfor, and Government inspectors are rarely very favomrable to Tailways. I am, however, far from finding fault with Colonel Wynne's report; but thisImust remark, that the state of the bridges was brought before us by hr. iBruff, our engineer, at the time he was appointed; that ie forthwith set about their reparation, that the passenger traffic has been conveyed over them for the last 12 nmonths 'with perfect safety, that the full sum required (l50,000t.) far their 'reparation and the' improvement of the entire lim e was, five months ago, stated to the proprietary by Mr. Brnl. Mr Hawkshaw, and the board, and that the'only new 'questiSu raised by the Govermment inspector is as Jo the present safety of a poDtion only of the line. The facts, however, would appear to show that Colonel Wynne entertains anudue apprehension on this point; that a great deal has of late been done to improve it is admnitted in his report, and the linehhavingbeenworkedforthelastyear without accident, and now undergoing constant improvement and reparations I cannot assent to the conclusion that it is at present dau. gerous for traffic. No line of railway that has been in e,x. istence as long as the Eastern Counties is free from defecto requirinngprecautions for the safety of -the public. SWmilir precantions, I feel assured, will eable' the officers 'of the Eastern Counties safely to convey passengers over all our system, and I am persuaded it only needs the inspection of a really practical and experienced and perfectly independent engineer to remove the exaggerated alarms cTeated 'by Colonel Wynne's letter. Such an inspection will, Itrast, be directed by the boardL I am, Sir, your o'bedient servant, DAVID WADDLNGTON. Bishopsgae-stxtion, Jan. 8 TO THE EDITOR OF TIIE TIHES. Sir,-I was much grieved to read the reportbynIeute. nsnt-Colonel Wynne, in 277e 2imesc of yesterday, upon the -dilapidated and dangerous condition of the bridges gene. rally.and the permanent way of that portion of the railway mow ealledEastern Counties, since its amalgamation withtha " Eastern Counties Railway" proper, between LIondon and Colchester. - AIay request the favour of your correcting such state. ment, so far as relates to the bridges upon theEastern Counties proper between London and Colchester, not one of which, among the 350 viaduct arches, road and river bridges} is constroted of timber, the whole being built of brick, stone, and iron?

FAUDS sON TE LNcomFx-Ax.-A correspondenf of Tie Timeus, who vrites from fffznchester, complains om the frequency with which the income-tax is evaded. -u says:-" Even in my limited acquaintance the number of bachelors wholiveinlodgings, inaugtheir 2001. or 300!. a-year as salesmen and clerks, and 'who have nerer paid 6d.L is something astonishing, and is only to be equalled- by the number of people in business on their own account who pay on about as many hundreds a-year as they makethousands ' It is to be feared that there isa great deal of trath imi this complaint, that miany people continue to escape the payment of the tax, and that many others make false retrns to, the commissioners for the purpose of obtaining a-rating be-- low that on which they ought to be charged.

LO2:DO2BD, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 186. Everybody knows that Mr. COBDEN has many strong points. He can argue, he can declaim, he can sophisticate a plain question, and apparently resolve a difficult one by sliding dexterously over its tender places, avd he has a faculty of throwing in observations which prejudice the cause he disputes without tenderin'g any distinct or tangible isue. But one faculty Vf. COEDEN undoubtedly does not possess. He is an orator, but he is no prophet. Whether it be from a defect of imagination, from the impossibility li'e labours under of stating a case more fairly to }inmlf than he does to the public, or from what other cause, we know not, but MIr. COBDEN is assuredly, of all men, the least prescient, and, even if we were to allow him to be right asto thepresent,the least able to form sound sp1nxons conceninng the future, When, therefore, we received a pamphlet with the rather arrogant tile, " WThat Next and Nert P' haplying that its gifted author can see the imnieiate future, and, taking his stand on'that futured as if it were- already present, can 'also mfold to us the events that are to arise out of events tha6l have not'yet arisen, the Iat name we should expIct to iee'subscribed to such a high offort of the prophetic- faculty is that of RxHcAD CoBDEnN. Even as LasToX believed himself to be a. misundertood tragedian, and PE=Arx despied his Italian verses, which everybody reads, and trusted his immortality to his Latin poems, which nobody can endure, so does Mr. CO:Dsn come forth to show us the, tlng-t.hat are to be herater. WlAt, then ueit,i "a d t M- next to that? We are Io attack Nichoiaieff, aud itia granted that we may take it; Perekop *will be invbsteaj the forts. of the Danube. attacked, Odessa oVcupied, every place within 50 miles of the BRack Sea may, llr. CbBDEmf thinks, fall into the hands of the allies,-we may march to Tiflis, drive the Russians from Georgia and their Transcaucasian provinces ;-" This is " the next,"-the pauloepojstfidu'im of the advocate of peace, and a very prety prospect too. :Most people wi think such a future worth many toils and many sacrifices, and Russia has but little reason to exult in the destiny which her advocate and her prophet foresees for her. For our part, we wish that Mr. COBDmE had not made these predictions, for we have a thorough confidence that what he foretells swll never come to pass, and begin to despair of the fortune of the country so soon as he takes it under his patronage. Now comes the grand problem. Granted all these circumstances, what will Rissia do ? " She "-will never submit," says Mr.XonDxN, "because we "cmnnot capture her capital,"a bad argument enough, for the fate of NAroLEoN warns us that the capture of the capital is not alone sufficient to bring her to terms; and, secondly, because it is not in our power to put upon her a pressure by destroying her commerce and cutting off the sources of her revenue. This argument MIr. CoBDEN expounds at great length. Russia is a Protectionist country, and it is edifying to see the old leader of the Anti-Corn Law league arguing that the Protectionist policy of Russia has inflicted upon her comnercial isolation, and thus made her independent of foreigntrade in time of war. We congratulate Lord DEmmr on the possession of such a convert, and rejoice that the cause of free trade no longer stands in need of such defence as Mr. COBDEiNS pacific notions can allow him to give it. Then Russia has a large internal trade and an overland commnerce with Asia, which no blockading squadron can reach-forced, indeed, and unnatural, but on that account, as it now seems to the advocate of unrestricted' commerce, the more sure and reliable in time of pressure. Then comes Mr. GLADsroxses topic,-the patriotism of Russia, and the ardour with which her religion inspires a nahcrally peaceful people in the cause of armed aggression and territorial annexation. But Russia has another safeguard equally strong, and, to our mind, still more paradoxical. Russia is excessively poor, and therefore not formidable as an aggressive Power; but she can raise everything in kind from her own territories, and therefore is still able to support a protracted straggle. Here, then, is the sum of MIr. CoBDnnes argaunient :-Russia is Protectionist, forces her trade into a 'wrong channel; her people are ignorant, unwarlike, and' fanatical; her revenues are scanty, and her only resource is the robbing her people of those raw materials for which she cannot pay; and from these elements of strength we are to conclude that no amount of pressure put upon her by the alies will induce her to come to such terms as are proposed to her by Austria, whose pacific tendencies 3fr. COBDEN at one time could not too much admire. Had she been highly commercial, with a flourishing trade, a intelligent, warlike, and enlightened people, an increasing revenue, and large accumulated capital, would not the proposition have been easier of proof I It matters not to Mr. CO xDEN,-he could have demonstrated it by one contrary, but, as he has not got that, he is equally able to demonstrate it by the other. His view of the power of the allies presents the exact complement of the paradox. The allies are wealthy, and therefore cannot afford to spend money; their people are well off, and therefore will not 'fight; have large commercial interestS and therefore cannot afford to risk them; have realized the advantages of manufactures and commerce, and therefore are better off than if, as at the beginning of the last war, they were oniy'going to realize them; and, although a paper currency will enable Russia indefinitely to prolong the struggle, England and France can neither forego this expedient nor have recourse to it without certain ruin. Thus, in war, wealth is poverty and poverty is wealth. False principles of government are stronger and better than true. Slavery is mnore powerful than freedom, superstition than enlightenment, and, in one word, barbarism than civilization. Having finished prophesying, Mr. CoBDEnbetakes himself to practical admonition,' and tells us what he will do if we will only be wise enough to place our destiiiies in his prudent and consistent hands. First, he will withdraw every soldier from Russian ground. The reason given is cogent to a pacific, but scarcely persuasive to a magnanimous, mind. We can now bring them away with safety, but it may not always be so. It may not indeed. Let us run away for fear of danger, and then, whatever becomies of our credit, we shall, at any rate, save our lives. Secondly, as to the terms of peace. 'The solution is simple. We are to have no terms at all. If we ask terms Russia won't grant them; if she grant them she won't keep them. Why, then, ask for terms ? Difficulties vanish at every step. We have disbaiided our army, sent our negotiators about their business, and are now confronting Russia, with her half-million of soldiers, 'without attempting to make either peace or war. The attitude is novel and dignified. Thirdly, by way of bringing the matter to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion, we should plunge into German politics, and try to persuade Austria and Prassa, "whLo are "too wise and selfish " (convertible terms, in Mr. COsBDneS opinion) "to fight now,"thatGermanyhad better mnake a league to resist the encroachments of Russia for the future. This, together with our assurance that we do not intend to fight ourselves, having found the operation more unpleasant than we expected; will, no doubt, rouse the German nation to vigorous and united action, and strike a terror into the councils of Russia which the capture " of part of Sebastopol " has failed to inspire. If we fail in this mission, as even M1r. CoBDIN admits that we rmay, we must teconsider our views-conclude, on the authority of RussianizeId Germany, that our alarm was unfounded, and repent in sackeloth and ashes for having doubted the good intentions of the CzAn. Then follows an act of penance. The United States keep no ships of war of their owvn, and naturally do not like our keeping any. We must please thenm at any price; and, though it would be degrading to Russia to. reduce a single ship at the bidding of a foreign State, such a course would be both honourable and expedient to England. This, then, is Mr. ConDnes advice :-Withdraw your army, disarm your fleet, try to bring Germany over to your opinion, and, if you cannot do that, adopt hers; but,. whatever you do, leave thb Russiali Army and the Russian fleet intact, demand no tet;ms from Russia, but leave Turkey, Sweden, and Norway to her vengeance, and spin cottons and calicoes until the inevitable hour shal' arrive wisen by i p'aciiic triumph--.for a nation. that'has' weo this can never draw the sword againa-the GreeL' cXoSs shall flaunt from the dome of St.. Pal's, and -picture of the Trinity be worshilped by our enljghi`neBd conquerors in the Cathedral of Westinster. '
Th& ee is in certain quarters a dreamy sort of sentiment that the public opinion of this county, and in paticilar the press, is sOmething remarkably capricious in its direction, presumptuous in its undertaking, and unjuit in- its -awards. The1 ntiment does, not et ok tmples, and is not always expresaeA 1 it is rather whispered and hinted.' assumed as an esoteric belief, or piously inculcated by those who have not much else to inculcate in the nature of piety. Now, we are not at al prepared to deny the possibility or the actual existence of a thing so capricious, -presumptuous, and unjust as we have described; but we do maintain, very stoutly and confidently, that it is not the press-not, at least, that which the people of England undersand by the press. For this purpose we will take a ready test,-the very test, we have no doubt, that our most candid friends would select for us. We will go back a twelvemonth. [This is about the anniversary of the worst week in the Crimea-a week of such utter physical pPostration and mental despondency as we verily believe never before had fallen upon any considerable number of our countrsmen. It was the week, as we see by M1r. Woore' volume now before us, in which the 63d Regiment miustered only seven men-in which the {6th, that had landed just two months before, was reduced to 60-when the 90th haa buried 50 in eleven days. The three battalions of Guards were mere names, reduced to scarce a tithe of the numbers they haa carried from this country. It wasrthen our opinion, and is so still, that the army ought not to have been brought to that state, and that we ought to know the reason why it had been so. Several distinguished statesmen, for whom we felt the highest regard, and whom on some accounts we should delight to see this day in the public service, were displaced from the Government on this question. They were of opinion, it appears, like Topsy, that the calamity had " growed ;' that it was referable to no causation, and admitted of no inquiry. Lord PAsLMRSroN succeeded them, and, notwithstanding the apparent necessity of his position, was so strongly imbued with the error of his old colleagues as to oppose the Sebastopol Committee. He courteously proposed to meet the rioters half way, and that the Ministry itself should be the committee of the House. The gracious offer was not accepted. We obstinately insisted on a committee, and that a public one, and the committee so extorted went to work, even although four members of the new Government went into opposition rather than tolerate anything so " unconsti"tutional" and unpleasant. It was maintained that the Sebastopol Committee ought not, could not, would not do anything. The chief witnesses were away, the French Government was compromised, and a great deal more, and nothing but harm could come of it. Nevertheless, it went on ; it proved our case; and nobody is now found so hardy or so oblivious as to deny that it did a world of good; whereas the very threat that it wasto blow up the alliance, and so forth, is almost forgotten. But when Lord PAimmmToN, like the chivalrous PLANTAG=zET, had offered himself to lead the mob, he was too highminded not to redeem his promise. Accordingly, Sir Jomz 1IIfXm and some other commissioners went out to the Crimea, took a view of the ground, examined witnesses, made them rehearse the very scenes of neglect and misconduct, and attained just that thoroughly intimate and no less recondite knowledge of the subject which Lord PAUMSTON had felt the occasion to require. They made a report long ago. It is said to be a very strong report,-much stronger than that of the Parliamentary Committee; and it is further said that it seriously in6ulpates some of the principal administrative officers of the army, especially the Quartermaster-General, Sir RICHARD Arns. Now, we are wiling to admit that the report may have been made good use of, and that, being dramwn up with greater freedom, it may have furnished more suggestions of a detailed and practical character than the Parliamentary report, which was written rather warily, and in a neutral sense, to anticipate political criticism. We are ready to admit this, because the army is in a vastly better condition now than it was at this tini last year; even if, in some other respects, thcre does not appear to be much more forethought as to the conduct of thewar. But if an inquiry is good for anything, and if it is to be instituted at all, it ought to be carried out in its bearing upon the conduct of individuals, and the authors of the inquiry are bound to see it so carried out. We appeal, then, to our self-constituted inquirer, the author of Sir J. MUNIxals Commission,-did not the report reflect seriously on Sir RICAR-O ARLY? Then, how comes it to pass that this gentleman, who was so negligent, or so incapable, in the Crimea, has been made Quartermaster-General here ? How comies it to pas that, when he did not know his duties on the spot, he is now a member of the Council of War at Paris ? It appears, indeed, to be the rule of promotion. The man who is found unfit for his post in the Crimea has only to return home, and he has all the credit he can possibly desire for what he did not do when he had the opportunity. Having failed in the lesser sphere, it is presumed that he will succeed in the greater. Now, what has become of this report? It was asked for at the end of last session, and, of cou-se, some exceUlent reason was found for not producing it, and there now appear to be equally excellent reasons for forgetting it altogether. It cannot recall the opportunities thrown away and the army that has perished. Nor, for our part, have we any wish to make it the foundation of a new indictment against men whose incompetency is best rewarded with oblivion. But when Lord PAxxSrTON undertook to conduct the cause of the people he could hardly have meant that his promised report should be for the. sole use of the Horse Guards, still less that our military authorities should be at liberty to treat it as waste paper. If, as we hear, that report is even stronger than that of the Committee, the incompetency of our principal officers slew more than either the foe or the climate of the Crimea. That might be a misfortune ; but it will be something more than a rmisfortune if the incompetency of the same men should cost us possibly still greater losses. It very seldom happens that a mere change of position transforns anindifferent officer into a good one' much less is it found that a man who has failed in the lower office succeeds in the higher.' Doubtless it is painful to publish a report reflecting on a friend, still more painful to pass him over in consequence; but the lives of thousands, the honour of our country, and the great interests at stake are of rather more importance than the feelings of a courtier or a friend, and we should' have thought it the'chief use of an inquiry and a report that they would enable a MAinister to resist private importunities, and even prevent them. Should newv disasters occur,should the authorities at the seat of war have to complain of the Administration at home, and should thes complaints converge on the same men, we cannot doubt that the second reckoning 'Will be much more searching arnd deciarve than the frst, mad the excuse of ignorance and inexperience be no longer. admitted in the face of a-report only too full, true, and particular to be divulged. In the deploiabl e 'o6tingency to which we allude We vehture- to predict that no favr no| power in this realm, will be- able to.protect the report of the Conmission from absolute publicy,. still Ias to protect from pumuinient those who L;rst. suppressed the document, aind -tJJA- met it at nojght. .
Sured. if there be one sped;acle more hideou than anoth X it is that of - a little starving cda, gaagxg ab,ait the treets Lf Lo&i4hei l lenness of despair,--or, it mnay be, lying down-- under a portico-blue w-ith-cold, rough with filth, h;i poor littlc cheeksvwet with tears, and Wie teeth chattering, with hungry inery. The only light which will break in upon his sufferings is from thio: policeman!s bul's-eye. Sympathy will fall -pmOn his ear only in the form of a stern direction io, "c Move on." Ave, but whither shall he movet For himself, he can scarcely appreciate the motivea of the Executive power when he is ordered in sd summary a mamer to move from his blue room to bis red room-that is, from the poFtico at No. 1t to the portico at No. 123. His feelings may tell him, perhaps, that the wind nips him somewhat more keenly in one of these pleasant pots thn in the other; the axea cat may be a trifle more ferocious lower down the street; but theme, as he may justly conceive, are mere incidents of misery, scarcely sufficient to justify the inter. ruption of his sullen dream. It is doubltf whether his infantine imagination is at allequal to the flights by which maturer and better iwavacte& spirits can console themselves under the many trials and sufferings of life. We who write, and the thousands who reada these lines, may have been so fortunately placed as to arrive at the assurance that we are in GoD's hands, and that in some way or other, if we discharge our duty to the best of our ability here belo*, we hall awake one day from this uneasy dream of life to a bettw reality, far beyond our present powers of concep. tion. But what does poor lttle Tom TucxB% whom we have left cowering under his cold portioo, know about all this? If he have been so lucky a boy as to imbibe certain doses of Sun. day School instruction, aud if ho be closely quers. tioned by Mrs. Smms-NxA, the District Visiting Lady, as to his ideas of Heaven, it is to be feared the little well-driled hypocrite would siswer "Three colleats aday, and his duty to his neigh. "bour ," meaning by the last-named element of bliss that somewhat diffuse exposition of social duty which is to be found in the Church Catehismn. But, if we could dive into the very heart of hearts of this little boy, it is more probable that we should find his ideas of internal felicity to turn rather upon the endless fruition of greasy pudding at Il. a-dab; of " Arline" plums by the million; of stale sausage-rolls; of- three-cornered cranberry tarts, such as his soul has lusted after, as they were exposed to his long eager gaze il the windows of the penny piemanL Paradise, according to his imperfect ideas, would mean a region of slides and marbles, and such delicacies as have just been indicated. The paradise of children is, for the most part, sensul, save in the case of the "Dairyman's Daughter,a and other such precocious instances. This beig so, our poor little vagrant has little hope im the future to console him for the uncomfortable present. On the contrary, all that he sees arund him seems constituted for the express purpose of mocking his misery. He sees with starv. ing eye the genteel 'children wlio come home laden with toys from the Soho Bazaar to prepare themselves for the arduous duties of Twelfth Niglit. Occasionally, through the area grtingns he may even gain a glimpse of the- very dining. room in -which those pleasant orgies are in course of celebration-the blue light of the snapdragon. dish, and the ceremonies in use while his little fellow-creatures ame drawing for Idng and queen. But we must not push illustration too far lest space fail; so let the wind howl, and the snow fall, and the little boy starve on under his porch. We know such things are-but how are they to be prevented? There is no lack of good wil in this great town. "We are but expressing the thoughts of thousands and thousands of our fellow. townsmen when we say that, if indiscriminate alms. giving were the appropriate remedy, not a little child-save the few -who might be overlooled by accident-would this night lie dovn to sleep with a hungry belly. People are not brutes and savager because they happen to live in Belgravia or Grosvenor-square. The lady who enters the warm, well-lighted nursery, in -which her own little folks are revellng in comfort, would gladly relieve the misery of an children if ehe knew how. Here, however, me must pause; and, whatever may be the struggle in our own minds, expres the dehberate conviction that ordinary almngiving in the public streets, even to such little unfortunates as the one we have described, inot only is of no avail, but absolutely generates the evil we have it at heart to repress. Thenmisery, the indesc3ibable misery, of the children we have not exaggerated ore whit. There they are, starving about the streets. But, when we come to inq7iire into the orii,n and history of all this suffering, -we find that the poor little wretches are merely feeders to the gin palace. The alms bestowed by some charitable person, who hurries away lest he be caught in flagrant delict, help to swell the black mail levied on the community by filthy drabs and filthier ruffians for gin. The misery of children is the seed which is sown broadcast in our streets, and the crop shows itself in due course in the form of countless noggins. Benevolent persons who are inclined to encourago the system should not shrink from the contemplation of its results. loet there go about 11 o'clock at. might to the gin palaces frequented by the speculators in starving chil. dren. There, when their senses have recovered from the first whiff of compliEcated polution-when the first sickness has passed off, and the eye has accustomed itself to the glTre of. the briliant gas, let them see what it is they have encouraged. In a corner on the damp floor lies one wretchin a state of bestial unconsciousness, his rags reeldngwith the filthy odours of the last dramn, which he could not carry to his cracked lips. Near the counter a strong blear-eyed fellow is holding On, and hiccoughing out a desire for another quartern, while the partner of his joys and sorrows,in a shift and the draggled remains of a gown, is endea. vouring to tear him a-way. She had better leave him alone; this night, in their nuptial bower, he will kick her out of bed, knock her down hahf-a. dozen times, and she may esteem herself fortu. nate if the policeman anives before she is e&sd out of the window of the three-pair back. There are two or three damp cabmen drinking gi-& heap of fellows in flannel-jackets, roaring and bel. lowing at the top of thei voices, and drinking gin-female impostors rnbbing out their fictitious sores. and drinking gin-stunted pickpockets, boys in stature, but adults in crime, with the true wandering eye of the Old Bailey dock,, drinking gin; finally, the fathers, mothers and proprietors of the starvingchildren, drinking more' gin than any of the others. They have easier minds than the rest of that foul rabble, more certain incomes, and more sustained thirst. for gn'. Would.that all this were exaggeration and sentimentalism !

Were it not that a lhundred years ago Lord tovsv was in peril of his life and name, and went skuldng from the. drawwell of one ancient castle to the chimney of another, we could fancy that the gloomy feudalm of that savage era still overshadows the shire of aIverness. The Hon. Sixos FRAsan was the youngest captain but one in the Inverneesshire 3miitia; he received his appointment sia months ago; and now, on the death of the Lieutenant-Colonel, he has been raisei over aU his seniors to the head of the regiment. Sir A. GoRDox Ctrx,G7 the senior Major, has served in the army, so has 3Lajor Dupr, so has Captain Gx&T; but this young gentleman, after gi months of. Mlitia training, mounts at once to the place of honour and responsibility-and all because his father, Lord LovAT, is Lord-Lieutenant of the co7nty. At any time uch -an appointment would be highly reprehenable. It is by the example of such self-seeking, winled at in times when no immediate injury can foUow, that corruption spreads, until it becomea a system, and under the shadow of that system the individual offender shields himself from blame. But at present such jobbery is pecuLiarly odious. The 3Miitia regiments have an importance as feeders of the Line, of which Lord LoVAT is perhaps aware, although he would recognize it better if he had abstained from wing discord in it for tne sake of a miserable nepotism. It is poesible that the Militia regiments may not be called to active service; it is not likely that Russian gunboats will ever find their way to lIverness; local influence may be a more important qualification in the Colonel than mrlitary experience; but is that a reason for the gross jobbery of this appointment ? Is Lord DvAr's younger son the most inuential of Colonels, and muBt all the other officers, some of them men of experience, suffer the slight of having this young man placed- over their heads? If Lord LovAT dreams of those days when it was a virtue to be clannish; when duinhe-wamsels and pipers followed their chief, and only their chief, to battle; when Clan Ranald would have scorned to serve under Clan Alpine, and the MLicnOosHnS wou1d have shown their catspaw to any M'Pnmsox who should presume to command them, let hnim raie, as Highland chieftains in the last war did, a regiment of multitudinous FIASsnS-FRASs in rank, FRL&SM in file, FRASA in the van, FiuSsxn in the rear, and " r}tsm to the rescuee" for a battle-cry. but it is rather too much that he should treat the county MElitia as he would his own peculiar clan, and place his son at the head of it. What we are most amazed at is the shamelessness of the job. An outcry has been raised against the -whole system of army promotion; the co-utry is indignant at the favour shown to cetain high-born claimants, and the neglect withwhichtheir plebeian associates are treated. The Zose Guards defend their conduct by attributing a11 the blameto a ytem. What sytem can Lord LOVAT appeal to, that in defiance of public opinion, expressed in no mincing terms, in spite of the necessity of raising as much as possible the charaetr of the Militia, and with the most supercious treatment of the officers of the Inverneshire Regiment, he should thus exalt his son over their heads ? He has chosen to indulge in a most absurd exercise of power; and, for his. own sake, for the sake of Colonel FRAsxs, and of the regiment, the sooner he cancels this appointment the better.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your remarks in The Vimes of the 28th Ilt. on the architecture of the late and present centuries are sO lust that every architect who loves his arb must feel cheered and grateful to see a pen like yours emiloyed ine =smg the unblushing shams and vulgar tricks o modern arc itecture; for all professional remonstrances against false design, false construction, and shams of every kind will be useless without help like yours. In the justice of your tibute to the late 3fr. Puginl most cordiallyjoin; he 'was one of my dearest friends, and I can bear my mos willing, though humble, testimony to the singleness of purpose and utter absence of professional jealousy which so eminently distinguished hnm ; as also to his peifect negation of self in vindicating the truthfulness of medizeval work as compared with modern in his playful book called Contraws, yet even he, with all his undoubted genius and untiring industry,was controlled in almost every work he exeented, with, Ibelieve, one exception-the works he erected at Ramsgate-where he was his own clent and pa ~r. FbheEeve that there are few architects who are wiling to speak out who have not felt the leaden influence of what is somewhat facetiously called a committee of taste, or the still more irksome mandate of an ignorant and wilful employer, who too often thinls that he should do what he likes with his own. In all this I know that much has to be laid at the architect's own door in not resisting such influences withproper firmiess, and insisting on bemg his client's best friend in the work in which he is engaged; but it should also be remembered that there are few professional men who7 have. not the fear of being considered M-tempeied or stubborn if they should not be sufficiently pliant in sacrificing their. matured judgment to the whims of au emiloyer or - the caprices of those twaddlng commissioners from whom few - districts are free. . Should you, however, lend your werful pen a little longer to the cause of truthfuKess in an art which, before all -others, should be truthful and above all deceit, you 'wllw shame into finrness such of my professional brethren 'as might otherwiseyieldto the influences before alluded to, and deter meddling wsiseacres from attempting to control the educateda.ndpractical judgment of tha architect, whereas, perhaps, these same folks would trem~ble at -the ideaof differing in opiniori from their attorney.'

AMERICA. (A summary of the following, receivea by electrio telegraph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-] LIVIEPOOL, TUESDAY. Tho American mail steamship Baltic, Captain Comtaock, arrived this morning with advices from New York to the 26th nlt., and $300,000 in specie on freight. Congrems had adjourned over Christmas-day without having succeeded in electing a Speaker. The last vote ten was:- The Washington correspondent of the Nei& York7 Tllnhitzi state5sthat the messgge had been put in typo under the President's eye in the Executive mansion, and says "Abuse of conaideneo on former occasions is -ssigned as the reason for this extraordinary preeaution now. This step, however, is a new and a remarkable innovation upon all past preeedent, and, if it proves nothing elie, it estabEshes beyond aUl cavil that at least one person in the nation regards the message as of sufficient importance to be watched as if it containedthe revelations of inother Joe Smith." The Washington correspondent of ohe Tribune, referring.to-the differences between the Cabinets of London and Washington, says,- - "Amongthediplomaticcorps here the impression prevails pretty generaUy that Mr. Crampton wiU not 'D superseded, although he and his legatin are not quite so vell satisfied on this score. The ilea has gained credit and currency from the protracted character of the negotiations concerning the violation of the neutrality laws, as well as - from the important fact that in all the material discussions the agent was passed over, and the Goverrnment under who3e axithority-he acted was- held directly accountable. When this subject was first taken into consideration the President and the Cabinet weie urmed to the' adoption of a summary course, by sending fIr. Crampton his passports. But, after proper reflection, that policy was regarded as hadly consistent with true national dignity, since he was nothing more than i mniristezial officer in the business, and the real re§ponsibhity rested in another and higher quarter. The Administration proceeded Mpon this view of the case, and hence it is that Mir. Cramp ton is treatedas in a manner only contingently involved. It is verywell known thatL,ord Clarendon has more than once, and in private as well as in official intercorse, disavowed. any intention to offend the laws oF the United' States. Indeed, his explanations have been lttle short of apologies for what did occur. He has not hesitated to admit that a depodt was established in the British provinces, where -Brstish subhjects who were disposed to serve Her Majesty in the war might fid means of transportation and provision for carrying out such a desire. The cosrespondencobetsieen the two Govrerrnments has been conducted with reference to -the particular point whether this avowed purpose was* orwas not transcended, so as to involve the recruiting which has been charSed, and was recently established on the trialEs in Philadelphia. In his last despatch Lord Clarendon' laboured to make out a plIausible case sustaining the position which he first assumed, and impeaching the integrity of the testimony which was brought mto CoT As the British Government has thus occupied this ground, it is difficult to see how the Minister here can be made the scapegoat of its voluntary complications. Had Mr. CramPten been dismissed at the outset, he might have shared the fate of many distinguished examples in history, upon who2n fortune frowvned without just cause, and been disregarded for inconvenient zeal. As it is, they iust' stand by him or he dis- honoured. The ushot of tho whole business is likely to be. awarning to the Lritish Government which itwillbe apt to regard in the futur" The steamship Northern Light has been soized at New York on a charge of being engaged in a Fillibustering expedition .to Nicaragua. On the 24th, while on her way down the bay for San Juan do Nicaraznu, she was brought to by a shot from the lUnited St'ates' revenue cutter Washinoton, and com peled to return andanchor in the North River. Itappear that Disttrict Attorney M-Keon received a telegraphic derpatch from Washington ordering hiim to prevent the sailing of the Northern Light. Messrs. Ryer and Cook were immediately deputed to board her from her wharf and seize her in the name of the Government. They found about 350 young men on board, the majority evidently belonoing to the class of "Roughs," many of them poorly clothed and obviously in destitute circumstances. The seizure was ordered on the ground that the people on board were not bond fide passengoers, but adventurers, going out to join Walker's army. Preparations were being made to get the vessel offwhen the officers went on board. As the captain was ashore, they found the chief engineer, and orderednhim not to start her engines. Shor~tly afterwards Captain Tinidlepaugh went o boardfthe steamer with a Custom-haouse clearance, when the officers informed him of the order from Washington. The captain said he knew nothing abot Fillibustering. Mr. White, the agent of the company, said that the steamer would sail at her appointed hour, notwithstanding- the warrant. Officer Ryer then stated that he had orders to seize certain articles on beard; upon which M.r. White said in that cas.e the vessel would not leave. The captain and BMtr. WVhite then went to the district attorney's-office. Thegreatestoonfusioi ensued on board and in the dock at the turn which affairs had taken. Captain Tinklepaugh returned, the hawser was cast off, and the steamer put out into the river, and proceeded down the bay on her voyage, with the United States officers on board. The United States revenue cutter Washington was made fast to a steam-tug, and towed ifter her. A blank cartridge was fired from the cutter, and then a ball was sent across the steamer's bows, to brino her to. She -stopped before reaching Quamntine, and by order of the commander of the cutter put back and cast anchor. The latter anchored a little below her, and during the night kept wateh over her movements with- guns loaded and springs on her cables. The passengers were ordered to remain on board,butaniumberof them were smuggled ashore in the course of the evening by the Battery boatmen. Each of the Fillibusters, most of them very miserable looidng fellows, were supplied with a cloth button as a pass. They were well supplied with spirits. On the following morning Messrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt and J. L. White gave seciuity in the sum of $100,000 for the Northern Light. The steamer was then formaUly released by the United States distrct attorney, Mr. MREeon, from the libel executed the day previous. Captain Tinldepaugh and M1r. Fowler, the chief engineer, were further held to bail, the former in the sum of $20,000, and' the latter in $10,000. Warrants of arrest were issued against Parker E. French, the Nicaraguan Minister; George B. Hall, Louis Schlesinger, T. B. Fariswrorth, f)il1ingham, and Mallery, charged with setting- on foot a miEtary- expedition against the State of NTicaragua, with which the United States -are at peace; At an early hour -in the morning some 200 of the steerage passengers, not having tickets, were p ut ashore. D)uring the day, -under the .directidn- and su zervson of the assistant district attorney, - Mr. 'oacbimtscn, the remaining passengers were subjected to a simar examination. The e,xamination of the cargo was postponed. - A reporter of the New Yor-sDailij Times spent the night 'on board the NorthernLight afterherseizpre. He thus describes what he witnessed .- "Thao brth-etstersweptatthef billuly over the deci of the steamer, and, with, the general bustre of thb.

'Iwas told to come hero, and my passage wouldbe paid to Nicaragua, and that I should have 200 acres of land wheuL I arrived there. I have come to go, and insist on going.' I Never mind this time," urged the exceeedingly courteous Captain Faunce 'noxt hitch, perhaps, you will hiveo better luck.' As far as he was individualy concerned, those who wished to go to Nicaragua, or to any other place, would have his consent; but he had been authorized not' only to allow those not having tickets to go ashore, but to Put all such ashore. These instructions he must obey. ." 'Instructi6ns go to the devil,' struck in another; ' no ono has a right to stopa lot of fellows who desire to emigrate peacefully.' u -the vessel,' added a third; 'its a sinkng concern, and the'sooner we leave itthe better!' "Some, too drunk to articulate their ideas straightfor. ward, hiccoughed out their opposition or wilUnxgness to go, according as the caprice took them. By ingeniously chimmng i *n with the various whims of the divers parties he had to deal with-at one time joking and at another showing decisiveearnestness-aptain Faaunce at length succeeded in removing to the steam tug the entire pArty (in all, 170), with the exception of two. These (John Creightoni and J. J. - Morrison, both of New York, and formerly. atitached to the Csastom-house) persisted that they would not be put ashore anyhow. Captain Faunce accordingly orderedthat they be placed in irons. They wero fastened to the wheel of the wheelhouse, and, fromtheirnucomfortableposition,having to stand up, speedily regretted that they had not yielded to the ceom-i minds of t'he captain. - The residue, who. were llaced on board the stcam tugg were lauded at the foot of Pier No. 4. It 'was nearly 3 o'clock when the steam tuz bore the party away. Their yells and songs bordered orL the terrific, and must have been heard at a great distance. " The job ended, the NZorthern jight presented a comparatively deserted appearance. Qvuet now Prevailed; the marshals slackened the celerity and w atchfugness of their movements; the officers betookfthemselves to their staterooms, and those who could fnd eorners to retreat to availed themselves of the same- Nothing intervened to interrupt the quietness during the forenoon." Referiing to this event, the Tribu(ne says that the United States authorities have been fuimished with affidavits and documents-which they deem irrefutable-showing that a wide-spread movement, has been comTmenced all along the Atlantic seaboard of the United- States to send men and ams to Nicaragaa, for the purpose of organizing an army il that State to descend upon Cuba and St. Domingo, and wrest them from their present possessors. After the consummnation of this design the parties interested in the movement propose to unite into one confederacy the State of Nicaragua and such other portions of Central Aneriea as faay be acquired by conquest or otherwise, Cuba and St. Domingo, and either to set up a separate republic or to apply for admission into the American Union as slave States. "It is alleged," says the TsiF- " That thousands of the-most-recldess-adventurersin the Atlantic cities have already been enlisted in this movement, and that the ranks of the would-be invadbrs are daily augmented by extensive accessions from the interior; and it i3 farther alleged that Walker cares not a tittle for Nicaragua, any further than as she may prove serviceable as a gathering point for the invading anrmy. So far as we can learn, thi; information is supposed to have come into the possession. of the United States' Government through the treachery of the man who was to have gono out as General of the expodition. How true this may be we have no means of judging ; but that this person is- said to have revealed the plans of the Cuban Jun.ta-tho Junta, by the way, is charged with being at the bottom of the whole affair-that he was visited at his own house in Brooklyn after midnight a few. nights since, and dragged from his bed by amed ruffians, and no doubt would have been slain had he not seized a timely opportunity to escape from their bowie lnives, is wellknown. When we went on board yesterday none of the 'I oughs' were visible; bnt the passengers described those who> left-during M1onday night as the most raffilanly a and vile of all the off-sco=fngs -of crepition. The captaix of the First Ward Police, speak- ing of-them, said that they'consisted for tho most part of pocketbook droppers, sneak thieves, runners, hackmen, and vagabonds of we orstclass irLthe city, and it was a great pity thit they weto not to be so easily got rid of." A -comnunication from Washington asserts that at New Orleans upwards of 1,000- men had been oagsnized and armed by Colonel Grant for a descent on Nicaragua. Advices from Havannah report a duil market for suggra and a scarcity of buyers. At New York there was ain'active demand for money, but with an; adequte supply, atl10 to 12 per cent. The imports of the week were -'eryheavy, owing to the large influx of vessels from European ports. They amounted in value to $2,811,899, being more thaa double the entries during the corresponding period of lat* year. - Exchange on London was 8 to 9 per cent. Cotton was quiet, and prsces were sustained only by the meagre supply in store. An increased export demand and a reduced supply had cau8ed a slight rise in some descriptions of ftour and meal. The inarket for wheat had assumed a slightly firmer tone. Scotch pig iron was quiet, but firm. - Freights were without material change, though rates were barely sustained.

S. ±ne appomitment of Sir Colman O'Logblen is positively announced in the Mail of last night, and from his promotion, it is to be inferred that the learned baronet for the present gives up all idea of obtaining a seat in the house of Commons, unless he is prepared to resign the office of Assistant-Barristcr for the shadovvy prospect of Parliamentary fame. There were f our candidates f or thle chaurmanship, and so equally balanced were the chances -with regard to tliree of them,-that, up to the very last moment, outsiders wvere ignorant of the name of the winner. ;especting the recent dispensation of Government patronage, the Eme;ing Ma c complains, not of the mcn, but of a particular religious creed having beenj as it were, the leading qualification for those appointments:- "Mr. Sausse, Assistant-Barrister for the county of Wexford, has been appointed a Puisne Judge of Bombay, with a salary of 6,000!. a-year. 3,r. Sausse, we believe, is a highly respectable man, and we rejoice that the spell which excluded Irish barristers from colonial appointments has been broken; but Mr. Sausse was morc fortunate, in a worldly sense, in his profession of the creed now-adays proper for an aspiring lawyer than in the fame of ever so much respectability. The nev Indian judge is a Roman Catholic, and Romanism is the estabbshed forensic *religion in Ireland. It is the creed - of Mr. Attorney and of 3Mr. Solicitor General, of the Castla lawv adviser, and of the Attorney-General's devil By faith in it a mountain was removed off the crowded ;clice bench andcast into theProtestantCourt of Admiralty, in order to make room. for Mr. O'Donnell, and it has now placed Sir Coliisin O'Loghlen in the Assistant-Barrister's seat acated-by Mr. Sausse.

SIR JOHN FBANKLU'P EXPEDITION. LIVERtPOOL, TUFsMA. By the Baltic we have advioes announcing the return of the Hudson!s-bay Company's Arctic expedition, and the confirination of Dr. Raes melancholy report as to the fate of Franklin's party. It will be recollected that Dr. Rae has been employed by the Hudsons-bay (Jdmpany for the last four or five years ir an effort t,o discover any traces of the remaims or theo fate of Sir Johii Frankidin and his party; that he has made two expeditions intoI the Arctie 'regions for. thit purpose, and that he was so sucessful in the, last expedition as to discover evidences of the fact that a party of white men, with ships and'boats, had perished in that faroff hyperborean region several years ago, which Dr. Rae concluded to have been- the ill-fated expedition he -as in Jearch of. 'Beyond finding some spoons, and other trifles namong the Esquimanux bearing the nameof" Franklin" and the above tidings which he gathered from the inhabitants his expedition amounted to nothing. It will also be recollected that soon after the eonclusion of his last tour the Hudson's-bay Company sent ' out another party to elicit still more facts on this point, and that, in pursuance of this design, a messenger was sent from their head-q rarters in Montreal to Governor Simpson at the Selkirk settlement to make the n-ecessary-arrangements for that purpose. Mr. J. D. Stewart and Mr. Anderson were selected forthis duty. The (St. Paul) Miknnesotiea, of December 12, gives the following account of Mr. Stewarts expedition and its sad result_ _ *" Mr. Stewart, with a party of 14 men, therefore, started from his post, the Carlton-house,in 54' W. latitude, on the 7th day of February, 1855, and proceeded to Fort Chipswyan, at the head of Lake Athabasca, in latitude 58' S., at which point they arrived on the 5th day of March. It had been determinedtomake the trip to the Arctie Sea by water so far as was practicable, and the party therefore remained at this post unstil the 25th of May, busily engaged in constrctingboats, and Mnakin other preparations for their dreary journey. At that 'date the party left Fort Chpewyan, and journeyed by canoe on the Peace River, which connects Lake Athabasca with Slave Lake, some 350 miles in a north-westerly direcion, till, on the 30th day of May, they arrived at Fort Rcsolution, which is situated on an island in SlavelaLke. about latitude 61°. "At Fort Resolution the partt:y was joined boy Mr. Anderson, who, wvith Mr. Stewart, had been appoin= tothe command of the expedition. Here another delay was made, for the purpose of reorganization, and making the last preparations before attempting to penetrate the interminable frozen north. These arrangements completed, tho party started out on the 22d of June for the head of Great Fish River, or, as it is known on the map, Back River, in latitude aboutitb North. Thence they followed the course of the stream to the Arctic Ocean. Mr. Stewart represents the navigation of tbis 'river as exceedingly dangerous, bein obstracted by over 100 difficult rapids. Over all these, however, with nothing more substantial than birch-bark canoes, they passed in safety, and arrived at its month on the 30thof July.. "Here they met with Es uimaux, who corrobornted the reports of Dr. Rae, and directed them to Montreal Island, a short distance from the mouth of Back River, as the spot where, according to their instructions, they were to commence minute exploration. From this time until the 9th of August the party were industriously engaged in searches on the island and on the main land between 67" and 690 north latitude. We canot recapitulate the perils escaped. and privations endured by the brave band while seeling to fmd traces of their -countrymen who had Ished on those desolate shores. Three times they providentially escaped being I nipped,' as Mr. Stewart expressed it, or crushed between moving mountains of ice. At last on Montreal Island, where their explorations commenced, they found snow-shoes, k3no'n to be of English make, with the name of Dr. Stanley, who was sareon of Sir John Franklin!c ship, the Erebus, cut in them by a knife. "Afterwards they found on the same island a boat belongig to the rxanklin Expedition, with the name 'Terror' still distincUy visible. A piece of this boat, containing this name, was brought along with him by Mr. Stewart. Among theEsquirnaux werefoundironkettles corresponding in shape and sizewith those furnished to theFYanklin Expedition, and bear' the mark of the British Government Other articles, known to have belonged to the expedition, were obtained from the EsTuimaux, and brought by the partyfor depositwith the British Government. No bodies, nowever, were found, or traces of any. The report of the Esquimaux was, that one man died on Montreal Island, and that the balance of the party wandered on the beach of the mainland opposite, matil, worn out by fatigue and starvation, the one by one, laid themselves down and died too. "The Esqujimnx reported, farther, that Indians far to the north of them, who had seen the ships of Franklin's party, and visited them, stated that they had , both been cr=shed between the icebergs. Mr. Stewart took especial p to ascertain whether the party had come to their eath by fair means or foul; but to every inquiry the Esuimaux protested that they had died of starvation. Gathering together the relics found, the party set out on their return en the 9th of August last. The retarn route did not vary materially from that tak-en on their way north. Mr. Stewart has occupied the wholo time since in reaching our city, having come bythe 'way of the Red River country, and having been absent in all ahoutlO months. Mr. Stewart left St. Paul yesterday cni routc to the Eudson's-bay headquarters at Lachime, Canada, to subrcit an account of his advrentures." The St. Paur.p Tivies, in its accoumt, says:- " The expedition reached what is called Montreal Island, where they fell in with some Esquimaux, who informed them where the crew of the Terror (one of Franklin's ships) met their untimely fate. They gathered up the remains of a boat having the name of Sir John Eanklin on it, a hammer, kettles, part of a blue flag, and other articles belonging to the unfortanate vessel. We are informed by the Esquimaux that they reached the spot just in time to see the last man die of hunger, who was leaning aggainst some object when discovered. He was too far gone to be saved. The wolves were very thick there, and no traces of the bones of the men could be seen, sapposed to have been eaten by the wolves. The Esquimsaux state that it is four years ago since the crew perisheL. It was on the ooast opposite Montreal Island. Their bones lie buried in the sand within an extent of 12 miles. This is the fifth winter since theyperished, and the drifting sands of that barxen region, being in lat. 68' north, have pfled in saccessive layers on the bones of these noble and illfated men. Mr. Stevwart describes the region as dreary in the extreme-not a blade of grass or a stick of timber met the eye. No gameof anykind could be found. ThelEZsqulmaux, from wh m their mformation was obtained by s*Ins, pressed their fingers into their cheeks, andplacing their hands on their stomachs, endeavoured to indicate the manner of their horrble death. They-were charged with klling them, but merely answered with their sighs." The Montreal Herald, of December 24, has a more detailed account of the expedition "The officers selected to lead the party were Mr. Anderson, a chief factor of the company, and MEr. J. G. Stewart, a chief trader-both well qualified by experience, courage, physical strength, &c., for the ardxuous duty. The party consisted of these two officers and 14 men, and left Fort Resolution, a rt of the Hudson's-bay Company on Great Slave IZae, on the 22d of June last in two bark canoes, in which they performed the perilous voyage down Great Fish River-a river known to the -world for its dangers and horros by Sir Geoge Back's native. Fom Mr. Stewart we learn that he doubts that the party ever could have got safely down that stream to the coast had it not been for the wonderful dexterity of the three Iroquois royjscurs whom Sir George Simpson had prudently forwarded from Lachineto join the expedition-the three best men of his own canoe. "The partyreached the outlet or estuary of the river on the 30th of July, and slirted along its eastern shore as far as Point Beaufort, but found no traces to reward their search. Thence they crossed over to Montreal Island, 12 miles distant, lying near the western shore of the estuary; probably, in that crossing. incurring as great peril as any in the gloomy record of Arctic travels, pusling their bark canoes boldly out into the Arctic 'Ocean, and forcing their way through drifting masses of Arctic ice seven or eight feet thick But they were prepared to miake any effort to reach the island, which, as well as Point Aigle, near it, had been the place Dr. Rae inderstood the Esquiaaux to mean when describing where the white party perished in 1850; and they had the melancholy sat sfactio -of procuring on that very pot the 'fullest possible confirmaton of Dr. Rae's report. They also met Esquimauxin that viinity who had seen the whites, and gave much valuable information. 'Suffice it to' say that on the island were discovered the remains of a. boat, which- had been partially destroyed by the natives for the sake of the -wood and the metal fastenings. " Although there was sufficient left to identify it as belonging to the Franlin Expedition-one fragment of wood (nowv, as well as some other small relics, in -the yossession of the 'Hudson's-bay Company at Lachine) havmg the name ' Terror' branded on it, 'while another piece had the name of Mr. Stanley (surgeon of the Erebus) cut upon' it, this latter being- pat'of a snow-shoe,' evidently of Engish manufactur, being made of oak, a species of wood no man accustomed to use snow-shoes would ever select for the purpose- no 'paekrsorboos, no hm an rema wre found; no t lkely as 'fo years had eaps siner hisc tragedy w as e ponda lno sand beah en- ed to the atrmsof four AVti t =t ersandterislitt doubtlthat either 'the -sea; has iashecd off or the sand has buried' deep the unfortunates-.woio perished on this spot.

SIHEFFIELD MALUFACJURES. TO THEEDITOR OF THE TIES. - Sir,-You are never inore ready to allow space in your ' journal for the communications of others than when such communications are intended to combat any opinions published under your sanction ; 1, therefore, with more confidence, address you in the hope of rectifying some misappre. hiensions, and to some extent modifying the strong denurciations of. your correspondent "Amicust against the manufacturers of Sheffield. There is no more difficult task than to fight against gene. ralities. The statemernts, however, of 'iAnmicue" are ae vague that the work devolves upon me to prove, firstly, that our aimnin Sheffield has not been "cheapnessg of producion " and, secondly, that " Sheffield* waresare (not) getting into disrepute." Firstly, in reference to our aim being cheapness of produlction. Is your friend aware that each exporting manufacturer in Sheffield statnps his own name on every article which he manufactures ? Admitting this undeniable fact, does this not tend to prove that each producer expects a eertain positive advantage to result to him from every file, tool, saw, or article of cutlery which he sells, such article bearingi-pressedupon it his name, and very frequently his address also? Is not this, I ask,g- sort of moral guarantee for the confidence of the vendor in the article sold? There is this difference between the trade of Sheffield anl that of other towns-that,while vith other manufactures the continental or American dealer. must sell on his owx responsibility and guarantee, with SheffieWa articles the guarantee is given from the manufacturer through his brand to the consumer who orders his single iile or tooL In corroboration of this statement I may mention that scarcely any manufacturer existsinSheffield,employingmore than 10) worlmen, who has not some market where the artisan is acquainted with his stamp, demands it of the shopkeeper, and, confident in the quality as guaranteed by the marlk, would certainly refuse any article offered to him with anotherbrand. Is your correspondent " Anicus" aware that the workmen in Sheffield possess a society, or Union, and that through this union (permicious though be its influencesinmanyvinstances) every man, irrespective of his meritas a workman, is assured a certain regulated price for every species of worl=whish can be named? As labour forms the chief item inthe cost o£ manufacture, whetre is, then, the opportunity of malin this cheap rabbish of vrhich your correspondent speaks?' Again, the duties charged in foreign conntries being im most cases dependent on the weight, and not on the value, militate against any inducement to manufacture a cheap article, the duties being proportionably higher on the coni. mon than on the finer goods exported Fom, England. - Where are the evidences that Sheffield wares are getting into disrepute? Are they to be found inthe fact that Shef-. field files, payinga duty of 4T. lOs. per cvt., are still sold in enormous qun3tities in France? Are they .to be found iu the truth that, while continental manufacturers are conplaining of the state of trade, every hill in the neighbou±- hoed of Sheffield is being crowned vith the cottage of the: workman? Or are they to be foundinthe shameful facbii that Sheffield stamps and Sheffield labels are imitated onrtle. continent, rega-dless of every sentiment of honour, by the manufacturers there, who seek by these dishonest meaus to slhre the disrepute of Sheffield vares? This is a real evil, an evil worthy of the notice of your powerful pen. Coneive a man toilig for 20 or 30 years to esablissh a name whichho may regardasahbritage for his famRily; at length'the zamae becomes known ind worthy oE piratage ; the continental manufacturer- reaps his-harvest,.. floods the mnarkets with inferior goods; ssisted by the dealers, who are induced hv the difference in price; a t last the consumer, ignorant of these proc-eedings,deceiie ia hisexpectations of having always tho sayae article-when guaranteed by thesame stamp, changes for somie other; the' manufacturer here.:loses his sales, and frequently dies a- poor man, a victim to the unscrapulous dishonesty of those whom " Amicus" delights to hoxonr. - These are facts known and acknowledged by every daler of so-called Sheffield wares in the whole wold, Wherever tho enterprise and perseverance of our houses -mayhare enabled themto establish a nard, i,,ceyUa kill 'find, following them iike a shado the continentamanufacturer 'with his counterfeit.

T21HE RiVSSZW FLIGHT PRO. SEBASOPOL. The following letter waswritten by a directreaf of the Rssian Sisters of. Mercy, on the nort}E aide of Sebastopol, two days after its evacuation ;"Sebastopol, Sept. 10. "My last letter breathed no presentiment of the deep and universal grief that has come over us.' You know now thAt we hve abaizdoned Sebastopol to the enemy; but how? Thi whole town was changed into a eaof fame; all tLae batteries andastions are blown up. It was a horror of desolation-a chaos-more dreadful than hlL That is all I cau tell yon abou it.' A syet I can give no account of all We have goae through, nor can I comprehend how we have borne such terrors, how survived such agony. I am hardly able towIVite to you, my thoughts are so confused; but, by Godas grace, my strength of will is preserved. You will easily conceive how much we ae suffering in our hearts and souls. I would rather have died than have witnessed that terrible moment-those scenes so bloody, such as no war has ever yet produced. As far as may powers enable jme winW describe everthing to you in full.. "'At 4 oclock (September 7) 1 visited the different stations; tle bombardment s still going on and, by the time I reached the 31ichailoff battery it was half-past 6. I put some provisions into my boat, aud had myself roweed across the bay byour sailor. Bombs were flying about, and so near that we got. thoroughly splashed, but we gained the opposite shore in safety. From the landing-place I ran ;withont stopping to the Michailcff battery; it was getting dark, and the Sisters screamed with' fright when they saw me. Of the woundedall Ican sayis thatthere were agreat rmany, so that the Sisters worked day and night; all, without exception, laboured with their whole heart, and human words cannot utter the gratitude they have earned by their devotedness. The Lord has seen their zeal and the sorrow of their souls over the events that His holy will has ordained. I had hardly been there half an hour-we were taking our tea-when a bomb fell on the roof of the powder cellar. Happily the roof was covered with sandbags, and these saved it fromn the explosion of the bomb that instantly ensued. Imagine the universal fright. We all thought we should be blown up. They begged. me to leave the battery as fast as I could, and so, being accompanied by Sister K., who came here from the Caucasus, I hurried to the shore. Before we reached the landing-place of the lichailoff battery we twice ran the risk of being struck 'by the bals. At 9 o'clock we got houae uninjured. "Next morning (September 8) we were all of us ready by ao clock. I gave orders to have everything prepared that was requisite at the different stations, and went myself to our hospital. At 10 o'clock I drove out, but our horses were so exhausted that it vas 11 before I arrived at the hospital, which stands upon a hill. From there we perceived that a heavy cannonade was going on, but I could not imagine it tobo actually the storming; the wind wafted the sound to another quarter. They told me in the hospital that the attack had begun; I begged my good and active Sister J.-she was a Miss B. before marriage-to neglect none of my arrangements, and then I left her in all haste, toattendto my duty in all directions. On my way to the city I saw a strong body. of mounted men riding as full galop towards Sebastopol; it was the Commander-in-Chief with his suite. I made the coachman drive as fast as possible after them, going firtof all to the barracks on the north side. Here I hear that a Sister had been wounded, not mortaly but severely, at the Michailoff battery. The entire left wing and the Malakhoff tower were in a blaze with the firing of artillery. I found the space about the Michailoff battery covered with troops, who wanted to cross the bridge, and the enemy directed his fire more especialdy against that spot. All the Sisters of the Michailoff battery were welL From here I wished to be accompanied across the bridge by Mother Seraphine, a nun, you must know, from Tver, who joined our sisterhood at its foundation. Just as we were going, however, to step uspon the bridge in order to follow the troops, General Buchmeier held us back, and advised us to return, for it was too dangerous, he said. I begged him to let me go, made the sign of the cross, and ran across the bridge. The troops hastened at a running pace over to the south side. The wind was so strong that the waves washed over the bridge, but, independent of that, the weight of the troops pressed it down under the water. The shots from the enemy's batteries were very frequent in this direction; but God was gracious to us. Balls fell close beside us or went over our heads, and often so near, that we all stooped low-they missed. I had strength enough to run as far as the Nicholaieff battery, but I had no sooner reached the Sisters' room, than I felt giddy, and had to take some drops as a restorative, I Was wet through up to my waist, formy dress and my feet had been all the time in the water. I asked after Sister S. She came to me with her eye bandaged up, but, thank Heaven, her wound is a slight one-not lke that of poor Sister W. Then I went to see Count Osten-Sacken. I had topass along a galery, on which many spectators were standing; as soon as a bomb or a ball came near we hid ourselves under the archways. In the inner court of the battery I found several gentlemen of the commandant's suite, and inquired of them where I should find the Count. They told me he was up in the,battery, with the Commander-in-Chief. II went up a narrow -wooden flight of steps, but could only crawl up very painfully, and when I was up my senses were all but leaving me. I could just ask the Count what his commands were for the Sisters in the' Nicholnieff battery. He answered: 'Take them all away. God knows what may happen in a few hours.' Somebody said the enemy's flag was waving already on the Malakhoff. A horrid depression seized my soul. I wept without tears, and I don't know how I got down again. I ran to the Sisters, begged them to let everything alone and follow me to the Michailoff battery. We set off, hoping that we might be able to return to the hospital as soon as it became more tranquil. The rumour spread that our troops had cut down the enemy's flag-what great, what a universal joy that was! ForaDlthat Ibeggedthe Sistersto followme, leit the rcare of our property to the surgeons and inspectors, and walked as fast as our strength would let us, At the same time the 'sick were carried across to the north side. A few hours later and all were safe. On the bridge we again met troops running; one ball hissed after another and-fell into the bay. Halfway across the bridge Sister B. fainted away through fright; a ball flew by us so. close that it all but struclk the bridge; I recommended Myself to God and looked about me to seeif {all the Sisters followed. Bebind me came Father Benjamin (the confessor of the sisterhood, and who had long been a monk on Mount Athos), 'and the priest to the fleet, concering whom I have often written to you. When I saw him I stopped, that I might go by his side; for he is not alone a pious and learned monk, but has a calm courageous mind. At that very instant a bomb fel close beside us. Sister B. could walk no further; Father Benjamin held her up by one arm, our soldier did the same by the other, and they half dragged her along. I dipped my handkerchief into the bay to revive her with' it. By God's help we camne safe and sound to the MDchailhoffbattery, and there Ileft the Sisters. " Here they were maldng ready to fire, and the men were running about. - The. commandant assured me there was no danger as yet. Istepped into the area. Our reserve troops were marching over the bridge,andbehindthemcame a column of the militia. Bombs and balls kept faling incessUntly-dead horses lay here and there. I squeezed my way through the troops to get to my conveyance; sud. denlya ball passed slantingly through the column of militia, about 10 steps in front of me. Horror and compassion rushed in a buning eddy through my breast, and I could move along no further. The wid nearly blew me down . my feet were perfectly stifr with the -wet and the cold wind' A soldier 'stepped towards me and helped me to walk; the soldier, who regularly escorted me sought in the meantime for the horses, and -had just come back with them, when a bomb burst over our heads in the air; a spliterfrom it broke a soldier's head into frignments, and his brains were scattered ever the cloak of the man who 'was sup. porting me. I stepped into thecar, and -the cold some. what' ecovered me.: On the way I traced outfa plan of. what I had-to do, - I drove to the market, and bought some bread of the good market man, Alexander Ivanovitch. He is the alderman of the market, who had already done us good service, on the 16th of August, on the heights of Mackenzie. Many sacrifices he ha made, and zealously helped us whenever he could. Severalotheratrdennen were faithfullystanding near him. I had as much bread put into the car as it would hold, and Alexander Ivanovitch sent up 100 large loaves with his ownhorses to the heights. Eaving returned to the barracks, Icommissioned Sister G. to go tha rounds, and give directions. I did not know yet where we should be sent to. Th e lti3tiUln-th6 left wing, and the rumour was general that we -were: being, worsted. Oh, that made ourhearts bleed!: ' - , "In thetwilight I drove back again to' the Michailoff battery.

In the dark we drove on to Battery No. 4, whae Sistei L is the elder.

I gave it all-over to her. Looking round I Xaw Count Wlelhorsky, who takes such pains in behalf of the wounded officen. Nothing keeps him back -ndther fear, nor darkness, nor danger. His vans werejust ariving;.he himself carried out the wounded officers, put them inside, and sent them off to the barrk I drove there also. Everywhere crowds of wounded-every room was occupied, and two barracks quite filled with officers. The Sisters carried round tea to the seriousy Wounded, but gave wine and brandy to the others. I again met Count Wielhorsky; it was I o@clock at night. A1l the Sisterswere iu barracks. Father Benjamin, too, he is occupied day and night. I say nothing to you about the groaning and shriels of the wounded; that rends the soul; I left with the Sisters two vehicles, and begged Sister G., in case of danger, to look to the safety of the'rest. I then wenf iiyself back 'to the Belbek. The way was strewed with the wounded; whoever was strong -enough walked; immense vans were conveying others, and their cries, their wuilings, were dreadful to listento.- Assoon as I reached ourhospital I had aR the camp kettles iade hot, and I then made tea for the wounded. This was about 2 in the mom. ing. At length I went to bed. "Next morning my feet were so sore and bad that tears came unbidden into my eyes. Gradually, however, I made shift to use them. I gave Mr. Philopoff orders to get to. gether the bread, had eatables of all sorts stowed into my carrage, and oeffI set. During the night Mother Seraphine had sent the two wounded Sist4.rs on to me at Belbek, and begged for horses, as she was in danger: I ordered two vehicles out immediately, and sent them to the Michailoff battery, meaning to gr, there myself as welL What a sight met my eyes I One huge cloud, black, but yet glowing, shrouded Sebastopol; our troops had set the'town on firethey themselves were on the march to the Tchernaya. Everywhere wounded were walking or being transported,thregients' were returningfrom the city. TheLordnow sent me tears-it is seldom I cry-and this relieied my heart. When I came to the barracks I handed tothe Sisters, who came to meet me, what they wanted, and I hastened on to Sister B; ;to her sick officers I brought clean linen, soap-tablets, tea, sugar, bread-all that was left, in shortsome Klukwa juiee, bandages, and brandy. Sister B. deserres all praise. When dtOld her she was in danger and must leave, since in case they blew up the Nicholaieff bat- tery, the battery No. 4 would be quite buried by the stones' --she begged me, as a petitioner, that I would leave her with her wounded,. most of whom are grievously so, if it was impossible to remove them. She was resigned to whatever might happen, even to being blown up, for she would share the -ate of those she was nursing. She begged me on leavig to bless them with the sign of the holy cross, for hfe or death. This I did, and did not venture to oppose her sacred resolution, but it cost me a great effort. I begged her to bless me also, and deeply honoured in my heart her love forthe Lord and her neighbour. Without losing time, Iplaced all my stock upon the ground, and drove off to the Miehailoff battery. On the place there was a chaotic mass ;-the bridge wa broken away, the ships of the line and the frigates were sunl, the city was in flames, black smoke mounted to the clouds, and explosions of powder made the earth tremble on every side. (ow hard it is to bear these trials, and how heartrending to be a witness of all this misery. I met Count Osten-Sacen; he begged me to leave the Sister with his friend' General Martineau, and then he asked me how I mysehf goton, for he percenved lcoud hardly crawl. looking intently at the inscriptio on my ross, he said-' Truly, now art thou, Lord2 our strong tower!'

D)ySMUCeIO OF' TEEE DOMx nW Snn,xsTPOL.- One of the five celebrated dry docks in the Karabelnajs suburb of Sebastopol was demolished by the French engineers on Saturday, the 224 of Decemaber, at 2 p.m., by the explosion of mines. The destruction of the dock was faUlyaccomplished, the blast having almost instantaneously reduced the massive fabric into a ruincd and confused heap of stones The intention of destrying a portion of the docks was not knowni in cam until an early hour of the morning of the same day. he si:- comnpanies of the 18thi Royal Irish: Regimient, wihfor the last month or five weeks have been quartered in the Karbelnala, assistinig in the nocessary preparations for the destruction of the three docks in rear and the part of the basin in charge of the English engineers, were moved up at5a.mu.,before daylight. Their departure wasthus vmobserved by the enemay on the north side of the roadstead. It was conisidered prudent to march these men up to camp, in case the Russianxs might think proper, after the explosion, to direct a heavy fire on the suLburb, and to avoid aul risk Of casualties, should any of th ulig fall from theo concussion. his movement was a sufficient intimation that the explosion of part olf the docks was at hand, hut in addition all servants and men -on fatigue, going into the town for wood, were early in the mornin stopped at the Redan, and subsequLently a cordon of sentries wvas drawn around to prevent officers or any mon from approaching within the neighbourhood of the docks where tere was the slightest chance of danger from the explosion. As it turned out,' ho~wever, these recautions proved -unnecessary, for the mines were so la~that the elrects of their explosion were confined to a very limited sphere of action. The dock seIected by'the French engineers for demolition on this occasion was the one p laced t o the west of the lock thlrou-h which vessels fonnerly entered into the great basin. Ei addition to this; docl; the French have to destroy another dry dock onit-he east side of the entrance lock, the lock itslf, -which, with its'sides and foundation of cut masonry and magnificenit floodgates, has the appearance of another doclk, and hialf the basin. It is understood that the engineering operations are completed for the demolitionL of the -whole of theme strrictures, and that the object in demolishing. one portion only was to test the accuracy of certain, cae;lcltons with regard to the quantity of gn powder necessary'for 'effecting the'desired result.Th quantity actually'emploed is said to have been a little over 2,000 punds Englis, or 1,000 French kilogramines.. The French engineers, have followed a somewhat different Nlan from the English engineets for' the' destruction of the ocla.They have trusted prie to galleries carried. across and beneath-the bottom e at"he dockc. They have also however, parallel with each side, a horizontal gallery. to 6low out, the founidation ancl lower part of each side wall.. In the docks Lto 'be destroe by the English, perpendicuilar shafts have been su=at frequent intervals along the sicles, for the purpose of blowing the whole of the sides"-inwards. latterly also, galleries have been constructed benea~th the foundations of the bottom of each doclk, so, that their* demolition must be very effectual. Arrangements have been made for firing the English miines by a voltaic batter y. The French mintes on Saturday were fired by means of trainis of laid gunpowder and fuses. The report of. the explosiont was by no means loud. It was heard in camjp, but was generally supposed to be the bursting of somne of .the. Russian projectiles among the buildings of the town. - Neareto the scene of the explosion a tremulous tati6n'of the ground was felt, and this was followed b the peculiar compressed' sound-more like the rubigo distant thunder than the usual report of gunpowdler fired from within metal-which always accompanmes subterraneoutldiscbiarges. Simultaneous wvith the noise of the blasftig, the'air over the situation of the dock bec-ame thickened with smoke, itoues and rubbish. A large quantity, among wb ''.eemasses of considerable siz, rose perpendiculaly uwrs while at the same timie a shower of. masonry was- huriled from each side upwards and cri~ towards thei'.eaitre,. The greater portion of these .Nck and~ ~ ~ ~ c frgenso tn pered to fall downwards into the vacant sac of the dock scarcely any were observed - 'to fly far beylnd its 'limits. A dense cloud of smoke filled andrested over the place' of. ruin, and this continued hanging oer-l it tor a consrderablo time,' for there was no breeze to waft it a'wa. bl sone had the explosion oc. curred, the crash of tMe falig aonry had scarcely died away from the eare when the sharp, fports 'of severa shells about th& laocks andl neighbouring buildings' told that the enemy had been 3o unobservant spectators of the seene. They hoped'to'lhit' somie of the troops. whoin they suspected tobe -in the neighibourhood of the ex-plosion, the nature of which they aio doubtt understdod but, 'as usual, fired without effecting 'any, inj'ury :Or~ causing casualtyr. Report says that aill'th'e preparatiojs wiil be comnpleted for the demolition of 'the 'treL66 docks to be destroyed by the, Englis in tho cdurse of a week from the present date. The arrangements wouild have been finished already had it not been lor the larja quantilty of water which has found its way into the shaftsand galleries excavated for the recep. tionof the blat power.

- TH PAST CAM-PAIaN.* Bf'M. Woods was the special correspoudent of our contemporary. the Mortniig Herald at the. siege of Sebastopol, and.he has now published a narrative of the past campaign, -composed mainly from his ownprenious reports and experiences, but comprising also the journal of M,a3jr Butler, who. with Lieute. nant Nasmyth so noblydefended Silistria, and con*cludingwith abrief aocount of the close of the siege of. Sebastopol, compiled after Mr. Woods had himself' left the 0rimea, disabled by an illness from wluch we trust he has perfectly recovered. It will naturally occur to the readers of MIr. WVood's volumes to compare them with the admirable sketches i for which we are ourelves indebted to our corre- spondent, MIr. Rusesell, and which that gentleman has since reprinted, without the option enjoyed by Mr. Woods. of revising and correct;ing'them into a finished narrative.- We shall not ourselves assist at such a comparison for reasons which are obvious, including the consideration that both works have their distinctive merits and reflect the highest credit on their respective authors, without reference to' their characteristic talents or comparative opportunities. One of the opportunities, for example, which Mr. .Woods enjoyed'was that of making his voyage outwards with Lord Raglan in the Caradoc. Accordingly, he notes the embarcation, the final entertainments and leavetakings, and the presentments whicli attended the visit of, arshal and Madame St. Arnaud to that vessel atMarseilles. The Caradoc broke down at Malta,. and Lord Raglan's 'voyage was continued in the Emen. Every other arrangement seemed equally to follow a routine and to break down with simultaneous alacrity. - "While we were waiting under repair, Admiral Stewarb made an attempt to relleve the transports which were be. calmed under the land outside tho harbour. For this purpose the Cyclops steamn frigate was ordered out to tow each hi ten miles clear off shore, but before she had moved the fit two miles her engines broke down, and she was obliged toreturntoport. The Ardentsteamsloopwasnextordered to proceed to sea for the same purpose: but her engines likewise were reported unfit for work, anrd the most cursory inspection showed thatit would be me manslatghter to keep anyone on board of her while steam was in her boilers. The Caradoc, having already broken down, was of course out of the question, and the Vesuvius under repairs equally so, and these were the only four steamers- in port. So the transports were left to themselves, and to lie becalmed off one of our largest naval stations for want of a steamer to pull them from-under the lee of the land." Henceforward Mr. Woods, whatevern may have been his co mission, appears to have had the unwelcome duty to point out one deficiency after another, and to unite his testimony with Mr. Russell's against the privations, the horrors, and the public disgrace of so initiating a great expedition. Mfr. Woods made his reports not only with great ability, but with a courage and honesty which we cannot too highly prize; and as we turn, in his pages, to scene after scene once eagerly denied, but now recognized- and received with averted gaze as too painful a remembrance, we renew again the intense excitement which the report of them first occasioned. Mr. Woods has great descriptive talents, but their exercise is beyond ordinary puaise when we remember that he described, promptly and with unfaltering fidelty, the aLarming incidents which it concerned us all to hear with a precision and force equal to the emergency. - When we read again Mr. Woods's narrative, such statements especially (and they are a largge proportion of the whole work) renew their hold on the attention and remind us of our debt to him in common with Mr. RusseL Thus we remark the early blunders at Varna, to the neighbourhood of which Commissary-General Strickland was sent in February, 184, and with respect to whom we learn that " every suggestion which this officer's long experience enabled him to make upon the best method of meeting the requirements of the troops was systematically disregarded." Again we hear of the infatuation which determined the. site of the camp at Varna. Lord de Ros reported against it ; the English merchants, whom Mr. Woods consulted, without exception declared it "beyond all doubt one of the very worst spots which coild by any possibility have been chosen. ' The whole country round Varna was unhealthy, but " the worst part of all was Devna." The Franks stared at the notion of our encamping near the spot, and it fulfilled the expectation of every well informed person when the cholera virulently answered our deliberate invitation of its visit. Again, we hear of our deficiency at this stage of cavalry, of ammunition, of tents, and of land transport. In fact, of the last, says Mr. Woods, "we were entirely destitute." The English and French had no chane of succouring Silistria. " In spite of the repeated assertions which at this time were made in England, that the English forces were fully provided with every requisite for a catnpaign, they were deficient in almost every essentiaL eVe hear of the 350 arabas sent us in our extremity by Omar Pasha, and how in the cour6e of a fortnight " scarcely 50 remained." Then " only 8,OOOlb. of tea had been sent out by the Goverment, and this absurdly small stock was expended a few days after our landing at Varna. Then, 80,0001b. of raw coffee in store could not even be issued for want of arabas." Then there were "no ambulances of any description;" "only two bullock waggons for the conveyance of hospital tents and hospital stores ;" one conveying the hospital marquee, the other the hospital stretchers, beds, bedding, and medicine chest. And what a reduction to a wretched pretence vas that poor destitute medicine chest! "Four bottles of brandy, four of wine, six pounds of arrowroot, and a few of the most necessary drugs and surgicalinstrumentsformed its whole contents." Such a medicine chest was allowed for the wants of each regiment of 1,000 men, and the regimental surgeons declared it contained not sufticient medicines to treat four cases of fever while " of drugs for diarrhoea they were almost destitute." Subsequently, as the event proved, our forces, when they were moved, were "much too small to. attempt anything against Sebastopol with any hopes of success" that year; but " a victory was necessary to save Ministers," and this devoted contingent of our army was embarked. In the meantime it was ridiculous to pretend that Sebastopol was blockaded. i Awar steamer" sighted" the plac4e once a week or so, but otherwise the Russians were left free to come out or in as they pleased. And they used the. facilities granted in numerous instances. Mr. Woods records many details of their cruisuing expeditions, how they stopped vessels, destroyed T'urkdsh traders and coalhulks of the a3lies, granted passes in sheer bravado, and in one instance, that of the Vladimir, made "no less than seiemt voyages about the Black Sea." Aain, when the cholera attackedthe cavalry camp at JaniBaszar there was scarcely any laudanun, tincture of opium, or astringents of any kind forthcoming. " In some regiments the officers gave up theirl own' small stocks of wine for the uss of the sick and aying otthirs aain contribasted candlesfor the hospitarquee, in order that the men might not lie there without avlight, and die in the dark like dogs. Begimental' sargeons, speaking of' this time, have told me over arnd over agamn, that they attributed' the lees of may men entirely to the want of proper medicines and medical comforts. - Of the Latter taore was absolutelynone of any kid or description whatsoever. s- sistant-surgeons and surgeons nsed to ride into Yarns, and, hiring boats, pass the whole day in endeaseuring to procure a7ittle arrowrot, sago, or port wine from the vessels of war or the transports-auchored m the bay. The principl medi- - cal officer of one division informied me, that he had spent out of his own pay upwards 'of 306 in proiiding pcoultry and ether little delicacies for his patients. This 's only one instance within my ozn'knowledge; hut I have no; the: least doubt but that there were many others of a' similar kind. Sir GeorgeBrown, whoknew the poverty of his division in respect of hospital comforts, made a. private present of six dozen of port and sixc dozen of sherry for the use of the siclc. AIn fact, but for the excertions of medical and other officers at this period, the 'mortlity amongthe English troops would have been verv much greater than it was." 'After.the landing in the C§rimea the samne destitu- tion continues; no tents, no ambulasc'es,- no proper medical stores, anda want of all kinds of baggage auimals. After the Alma "94 carts were required for. the First :Division," and. ConAissary-General Filder, 'doing ' hi utmost,' sent four.

The English engineers had no theodolites. xedicines and medical comforts were still wanting, and the foUowing was -the personur experience of the writer: ' i "Atthistime, onthemererumour thatI-wasthe forunate posessDor of some rice,-Ilbid applications from two or three medical officers, who begged me to spare them evenas littie s pound. They told me that they wanted it for men who were sick of dysentr,y aind to whom silt xations-were almost poison. - It was beieved tbat there ivas smill store of rice somewhere or other in- Ba ava, ut no one seemedtohav,fo-mdoutwhere. Itwsnotinimypoiwertogive the rice then, as at that time all mybaggage was or. board a veesgel which lay somewhere near the fleet off Sebstopol, and which was afterwards sent to'Eupatori.' - . : At the first bombardment ammunition fell short. Shells had been sent out, of which not 16 per cent. exploded. Some "halbeenmadeasfarba&ckas180.; others were of 1814 and 1820; and nearly all were m such a condition as-to-.be totally unervioeA1e." Subsequently, to repair our losses by diseise and ualties, reinforcements came in by driblets. When winter overtook; the diminished and shattered army there were no huts, many of the tents had been used in the Peninsular war, and boots, trousers, and stockingsvwere ina state onenfamiliartoConna iht. There were supplies of live cattle at Samsoun and Sinope; there were lemons,: potatoes, and, other vegetables in almost any quantity at VYrna and Trebizonde ,. there were onions, potatoes, and cabbages stacked and rotting at Balaldava, but the soldiers were condemtred still to green coffee:-berries and salt rations. There was still. a deficiency of medicines and of medical coinforts, while of medical officers there were two to 1,200 imarines. For these; there was not even a mustard plaster for inflamnmation of the lungs, and nothing but.a few pounds of alutm for'diarrhcea and dysentery. Tlhe' horses were starved {or want of forage; they tore the. straw -out of their pack saddles, chewed rags and scraps of paper, and actually tore the hair from each other's tails. There was no fuel for the troops; the "winter clothing," when it arrived, was a shameful "curiosity,". and as such many of its specimens were collected by the teriter. The writer, recording these annd scores of ether such facts, makes the following remarkable statemhent: "All the facts that I have mentioned in this chapter, iath others stil more important whicb afterwards occurred, are detailed at length in the repoit of the commissioner who was sent out by Government to institute an inquiryinto the causes of the lamentable mismanagement which-prevailed in the Crimea during the winter. ' The examination was conducted with the utmost fairness, every kind of witness -was interrogted, and, as might have been expected, some astoudng disclosures were made. This was done at the time that Mr. lRoebuclks committee was sitting in London, and all at the seat of war imagined that the evidence and the documents given to the Government Commissioner would be published, as-thc House of Commons' inquiry was so much sheer waste of time, and elicited nothing calculated to enminate any one very deeply. The commission sitting on the spot was of a very ditferent kind, and implicated, to an almost incredible (degree, some of the chief officers of the Staff. It was, therefore, with no little indignation that all in the East heard the Government state that this u-as a private inquiry, and that the evidence given before it would not be allowed to transpire. Themedical and commissariat staffs entirely relied upon the publication of this evidence for clearing their departanents from the unfounded blame which had been cast upon them. To this hour the public believe that the House of Commoris' committee exposed anl the abuses and mismanagement perpetrated in the Crimea, when intruth it did not fuUy expose one. Only from the: report of the commission I have mentioned wold the public be able to form a good idea of the miseries e ndured during the winter campaign of 1854-5."' eThe consequences-are illustiated thus: . "On the 8th of January, of the 63d Regiment, only seven remained fit for duty. On the same day the 46th, which had landed on the 8th of November, iusttwo months before, mustered only 60 serviceable men. - The 9Cth, a strong and healthy regiment, buried 50 men in 11 days; and one full company, durinn the same time, had only 17 men out of hospital. Thetireebattalions-of Guards were mere names. Outof 1,562men, sent outtothbeScotsansileers, from firstto last, oly 210 remAined. The th.ee battalions, which in all represented some 4,500 rank and file, at this time did not muster 700 men on parade, and of that number there was not one man who, in a time of peAce, would have been considered fit to be out of hospitaL During the monthof January, the troops always in hospital at camp averaged upwards of 3,000 men, and in the same mon,th no less than 4,073 invalids were actually sent away to Scutari.'>* ln the meantime Mr. Gladstone, in the House of Commons (February 2), was asseveratin- that the English Ihad 30,000 effective troops intle Crimea, " while the Adjutant-General's returns showed that there were only 12,000 effective men of a r ms." But we shall not attempt to produce further these testimonies to the desperate collapse-with whichMr. 'Woods's volumes abound; it is in trath an old - and lamentable story; and we -wil conclude with his honourable testimony to our own independent efforts :_ - neTinwascommissioner, Mr. Mcadonald,lwho was atfirst only sent out with a large sum of money, and a store of .comforts for the sick and wounded at, Scutari, and had distributed them in away of which eventhe officials of the hos- italswereforcedto aDprove, nowpushedhis mission further. o had at last succee ed at Scutari in-eradicating the-evils he was sent to mitigate, and he zow came up to BaLlsiva with a fine suppl of medical comforts for,the sick, and all the surgeors o the army eagerly availed-themselves of hiis aid,in spite of the marked disap robaSion ith wich- the headsof the medical staff regardedsuch undiguified' conduct."-t' We are consoled, for our want of space to do jistice to the admirable - descriptive talents df Mfr.

YeniKeui, a village situated at 18 hours' distanee from Erreroum, on the road to E:rs, is also oocupied by the Russians, who have concentrated there stores of provisions, of corn, flour, and barley. "It appears that the Russian General fears that SeUm Pasha will attack Ears, as he has concentrated all his forces on that pDint, and has only left a small garison at Alexandropol, scarcely sufficient to do the duty of the fortress. "The Turkish force under the orders of ScUm Pasha is still encamped in the mountains of D6v&Boynou (east of Erreroum). However, there is no fear of the enemy attenmpting just now a coup dc moain on that town; the fatigne of the troops and the state of the roa&Tprevent it."
WVHAT NBXT-AND NEXT? A pamphlet has just appeared with the above title, written by MIr. Cobden, devoted to thne consideration of the varioua phases wrhich the wvar may assume. Mr. Cobden, premising that the allies have lost in killed and wounded nearly as many men as it cost Napoleon, in actual com! bat, to gain possession of Moscow, and still Sebastopol is not wholly in our power, proceeds to mention a variety of hypothetical positions into which the contest may resolve itself. These supposed positions form the basis of arguments and anticipations as to the mode in which peace may be brought about, or the war continued. fir. Cobden enters into various statistics respecting the policy, trade, and general condition of RuSsia, and then describes the feelings of the Russian people, both religious and political. As a discussion of the correctness of Mr. Cobden's views and assumptions would open a wide field for argument, we now content ourselves with extracting [the concluding portion of the pamphlet, so as to enable our readers to form their own opinions of Mlr. Cobden's advice as to the best course to be adopted to terminate the great contest in which England has engaged:- "One word before concluding. I have been asleed, by those who have the right to make such an inquiry, what course I should take if, without reference to the past, I were from this moment responsible for the policy of the country? I have no hesitation in answering this question, and, to be still more pisetical and unreserred, I will place myself-but merely for the sake of argument-in the pesi. tion of -the present Government, and assume, for the moment, the respansibility of their objects and antecedents. "'L Ilould seek abovealthingstowithdraweveryBritish soldier from Rusian territory, the invasion of which waS a heedless blunder in both a political aud strategical point of view-I mean a blunder in those who still would have canried on the war in other directions. Our army may now be brought away without further loss or discredit. It may not always be so. Russia has been to all former invaders the grave or prison of armies, dynasties, and even of empjires. "t. With regard to the terms of peace, I should attach no value whatever to the promises of Russia as a guarantee for tho future,-the very word guarantee implying that you obtain other swcrity for the performance of a contract on the Wrt of one whose good faith or competency you mistrnst. we are now at war because Russia would not awree at tho Vienna Conference to sign a psrchment promise not to maintain more than four line-of-battle ships and a proportionate number of frigates and transports in the Black Sea. "1 Tne terms rhich are now tendered to Russia are of an analogons character, calling on her to promise not to dd certain acts in her own waters or on her 'own territory. Yet we are told, at the same time, through the very organ of the Prime Minister which announces these terms, tEat the Russian Government is 'free from the ties of truth and principle, usually binding on nations.' But although we believe those promises, if obtained, would not be worth tho parchment on which they are written, yet Russia will refuse them with a pertinacity greater and more enduring than probably any terms we could have demanded. It is considered a point of honour in a great empire not to consent to an invision of the right of sovereignty in its own territory. Diminutive Greece may submit to a Racifico outrage, and, by a Rathetic appeal to the principles of justice, gain a moral triumph, inr the world's opinmon, ovrer our dosen line-of-battle ships. But a first-class powrer would be dishononred in submnitting to any humiliation of the kind until after ite powers of resistanoo and endurance were oompletey exhauste. There could, perhaps, be nothing devised which would lead to a longer struggle than, were England and France to attempt to force America to sign a treaty binding he=f not to keep mo.o than four line-of-battle shi i the Gulf of Mexico; and yet she hasonlyoe such vessel in commission, and is not likely to have more. We have, therefore, hit upon termg which involve the szaximum of resistance before they will be yielded, And the vzinimum of advantage when obtained. I wouldx abandon such a policy as repugnant to reason. What course, then, shouldI pursue? ".3. I should recur to the polcy which our Government adoptec at the outset of the negotiations, when they turned to Germany and Anstria as most nearly concerned in the danger, and the only countries wbich could obstruct the march of Russia westward; forif theyleave the door open, it is in vain for u to try to lose it. Now, the geooraphy of Europe has not changed since the first negotiations at Vienna. If Germny and Austria occupied an important position then, they are relatively more powerful now, insmuch as the other Powers are weakened by war, and, if hostities noonforayearortwo,d theyremain atpeace, their relatrve weight in the Europ scale will be still more increasedL in the idea that Austria, Pruss, or Germany will join usin the present r. It has beeua sad reproach to our agacity thatfor 18 months,snce the retreat of the Russians from the Danube began,we have been deluding ourselves with the notion that those eountries, whose interests are on that-river, would follow us m our invason of the' Crimea. When the Duke of Newcastle wrote his celebrated despatch to Lord Raglan, on the 29th of June, 1854, recommending in these terms the expedition to the Crime&~rthe retreat of the Russian army across the Danube and the antiipated evacuation of the Principalities have given a new character to the war, and will render it necessary for you without delay,I&c.'-he and the Cabinet must have known that this retreat of the Russians from Silistria aid their return across tho Prath were steps taken by the Ruian Government to concliate Aus- tra ndthat from thatmoment (as stated by Lord John Rue31 in his deepatch from Viennua, April 16, 1855), we could no longer count upon her as an active participator in the wr. " But Austria and Germany, although they are too wise and selfish to follow us to the Crimea, where their interests do not, as theythink, beckonthem, yet with regard to al the future obiects of the war they are as completely identified with us as when our Government sunmonied therm to the Ifirst conferences. In fact, they occupy for the future the diplomatic ground we wished them to take from the mf Aketria has a treaty wth Turkey, binding herself to make the invason of the Principalities a camu belli apinst I Russia. Prussia and Austria have a treaty, making it ako an act of war against taem if Rusa pw the Balkanr - and Prusmia and Germany have engaged to defend Austria if she should be attacked by Russia. Here we have these Povers committed to the object we profess to have in view, not exactly in our vay, a little more compnlex, and somewhat slower in execution, but still, substantialy, nearly all we want; but more important still, at the close of t9re last Vienna Conferences Astria offered to enter into a tripartite treaty with France and England, binding herself by a posetive engagement (which she hover proffered to do before), to regsit in future any attac made hy Russia upon Turkey, or any attempt to maintain an exaggerated nalvs force in the Black Ses; and it was this offer, I have no doulbt, made at the very close of the negotiations, which converted 3L lDrouyn de thups and Lord JohnIRussell to the cause of peace. Now, here are grounds for believing that, for the future, Germany may be reckoned upon, by Western Europe, as a bulwark against Russian on. ItisthitherthatIshoulddiiect my diplomacy, lr rer inthepogdtion of our GovernMelli and sharedL their fears for the safetyEof urope. Let them try to condense these various and complicated engagements, to which I have alluded, into one simple treaty of the whole of Germany, There may be a difficulty in conving its [Governments, orIeople, of the reality of the danger which so alarms us. Htherto I believe the Teutonic family have been in no fear of being absorbed .by the Slayonic rue, Their traditions and experienoe point towards France rather than Russia as a source of danger. Their defensive fortifications are on the Rhine,nmot the Niemen. But let outr GovTernment point out to this intelligent -people the prounds of their alarm, and, if they be deemed weIll founded, there is quite as much l iove of 'Ifatherland' to reckon upon for repelling an invasion inGermany as-in any -"4.

Haa the regt of Europe ever been, s a wlhole, coslteid in a time of peac, and ir a deliberate 'manner, upon this danger, and invited to take a part in-averting it? If not, what shall we say of our Government, orotrgoVermingclass ordiplonmacy in general? Now, ~suming, again, that I occupied the position of onr Government, and were in earnest inl my fears for Europe, and attched a real meaning to those phrases just quoted, I asould not only appeal to Germany, but to all the States, smaull a well s great, of the oDntinent, for such a union as would prevent the possiblity of any act of hostility from the common enemy. This is the work of peace, and to this end, with the views ancd reponsibilities of the Government, I should address myself. f I found that I failed to imprt my apprehensions to -the other nations of Europe, if they declined- to form part of a league or confederation against Bussan encroachments, I should be disnosed to reconsider my own views on the subject, and.douSt whether 1-might not have been led away by an exaggerated alm. In that cmse; at least, I woild forego'the Quixotic niLssion of fighting for the liberties of Europe, and pusue a policy more just towards the interests,. and more consistentwith the prosperity, of thb people whos welfare Iwas moreespecially charged to promote. "Finally.-Not to incur the charge of vagneness; I would not risk the life of an Englishrmian, or spend another shilling, for the chance of the barren triumph of extorting pacific pledges from the Russan Government- and having come to this determination, there would no fonger be an obstacle to peace. But, while attaching no value to the limitation of the nwnber of Russian -ships exdusively, I should not lose sight of the policy of dealing with the amount of naval force as a- European question. England and France will dnd themnselves with morc powerful navies st the close of the war than were ever before pcssess4 by two allied Powers, from which state of thigs embarrassments may possibly rise in more than one direction, This naval armament has already reused the susceptibiities of the United States, and led to an augmentation of their navy. Hitherto that count'y has not entered into a rivalry with the States of Europe in their mili tary and naval establishments. But, impelled by feelings of insecurity or pride, the public sentiment appears to be undergoing a chenge as regards the navy. Should this spirit acquire strength in the mind of the nation, and reconcile it to the expense, there is no country in the world that in the course of a fewyears would be theirequal at se Little more than 20 years hence their population will reach 50,000,000, and their wealth is increasing in a far more rapid ratio. Is it wise on the part of the nations of the Old World, placed at such a disadvantage by their colossal debts, and the necessities they are under for keeping large standing armies, to fasten on themiselves a hostile naval rivalry with this Transatlantic people? To abate suc21 an impolitic provocation, as well as in the interests of European peace and propriety, I would endeavour to promote a general reduction of naval establishments at thecloseof the war. Russia has been sometimecs cited, heretofore, as an obstacle to such a policy; butaftertheabortive,nay,ridiculou.sexhibitionwhichlierhuge iavies have afforded to the world duringthe prosent war, the utter want of oonfidence and enterprise displayed by them, from the moment that a hostilo force appeared on her coasts, and which has more than justified the prediction that in six months she would, in the case of a war with England, or any other maritime nation, be 'crumpled up' as a naval Power; after such proofs of the folly of attempting to become a first class Power at sea, without tho possession of a mercantile marine, the Government of Russia would, I should expect, be the firSt to embrace an honourable pretence for voluntarily limiting her naval armament within tho most moderate and economical dimensions. " I should endeavour, then, on the advent of peace, to promote, as far as possible, an approximation on the part of theEuropean Powers to the naval standard of the Umited States-the country possessing the greatest amount of mercantile tonnage. Should tho close of the war be signalized by such a general reduction of warlike armaments in Europe as would be involved in this arrangement, it would in all human probability confer a lasting benefit on posterity, and amid the crimes and errors of the lt two years diplomacy might fairly claim for such a peeceful triumph the respect and gratitude of msnlkind."
MORE TURNIP STEALING AT STRATFORD- ON-A VON. TO THE EDITO=OF THE TIMS. Sir,-Another case of so-called turnip-steeling has occnrred here, somewvhat dissimilar in igs features to tho former one which"sppeared in T7he Times, but attended with simnilarmagisterial results. The facts are brieflv these ;-Three women are employed by a Mr Nownlam to clean turnips. On retunming home. theysar chaUlenged by a policeman, who finds in their baskets three, tvro, and one turnips, respectively. Mrs. Newnhans i9 appealed to, and refuses to Prosecute. In the meantime their houses are searched, and in the woman's house, upon whom the two turnips were found, three more are discovered, which, however, appear to have been brought home by either her doughter or husband, who are likewise employed*in turnip cleaning On Friday last these three women were tried, and sentenced by the sitting county magistrates for seven days' im rsozunment. owo, Ido not wish, in this place and at this time, to question the justice of the magistmtes (who, it seems, did not give the prisoner6 the ol?tion of paying a fine), though a casuist might probably object to the same amount of punishment inflicted for different degrees of theft; hut wrhat I say is this,-let the lawv be clearly understood by these poor people before it is put so rigorously into effect. A custom has exsted round about in these parts to take home turnips when employed upon them, and the farmers willingly concede the privilege when not abused-in the eye of- the lawr, & interpreted by these magistrates, it is a crime; we are not lawyers enough to settle the moot point, but justice and humanity suggest a different course to that which they~~~~~~~~ ~ta adptd.Ic Nohoneof the lower classes leaves a prison, even if they do not associate wi*h the criminals there, without a certain amount of demoralization, and the loss of caste among their fellows; and their innocence will not shield, we fear, these poor innocent women-victims of an overstrained Law-from such sad consequences.

A STRAGE STORy.-We learn from Captain M1eyer, late of the schooner Falmouth, who arrived yesterday from San Quintin, in the schooner Frances Helen, the followin; account of a mnutiny that occurred in the Gulf of California at a recent date:-" The schooner Waterwitch, Captain Young, sailed from this port some time since, with an asorted cargo, for Colorado River, having on board the ownsers, Messrs. Amies and Elliot. She proceeded up the Gulf of California about 200 miles, where it seems there is a barren anld uninhabited island. WVhile off that place Captain Young remarked to the owners of the vesse that there existed a large marble quarry at that place, and proposed landing to examine it. Mr. Ames assented, and, together with the captain and mate, accompanied by a large Ne'wfoundland do-, proceeded to the shore. The moment his companions left the boat Captain Young shoved off, leasing them, and returned to his vessel and put off to sea. Elliot, whowas still onboard,ex btulated with the catain, when the latter drew his pistok and commanded silence; hut, after some persuasion, Captain Young seemingly consented to return to the island and leave some provisions for theseleft behind. For this pretence he went ashore, taling Mr. Elliot along with him; but when the latter got oi shore the captain shoved off the boat and left him, as he supposed, with the others. The former persons, however, on the departure of the vessel, had killed the dog, and, cutting his skin in stripa , constracted a raft on which they embarked for the shore, some 15 miles distant, which they reached in safety. In the meantime, Captain Young had sh#ped his course up the gulf, having for his crew one silor and an Indian boy. The latter, overhearing the two former'in conversation, learnt they intended to cut his throat and throw him overboard, and proceed to Mulajoha Bay, where Captain Youn- intended to seU the vessel and cargo. Aftor hearing this Re quietly stripped off his clothes and dropped overboard and swam for the shore, about two miles distant which lie reached in safety. By this time Ames and his companions had reached Mulajoha Bay, when they gabve notice to the officers of the jace. Soon after the schooner hove in sight, and Captain Young landed, armed to the teeth, little dreaming that the news of his operations wvas in advance of him. As soon ac he landed he and his coDnM ion were arrested and put in prison. They are nOW en thei way for this port on board the schooner Rate Bj l Captam Parker. As soon as they found Mr. Elliat was on the island, a boat was sent for hIm, and he vas fortunately rescued from his perilous position. The Indian boy had also arrived at that place, having suffered considerabiy on his way.-&LnI?cncisco Herald. *1 ca7; G MsCExhSgRY E~~OP. AjI ENGLIr GOvM-3Mz.-We have'had occasion to allude several times within the last two years to the movements of' the English Government in revolutionizing their system of manuactring small firearms, so as to make it conform to the American system. Some two years ago the Englsh Government, determined upon a grand national armouryfor the manufacture of small arms, after the American plan, sent out to this country a commission of army officers and engineers for inspection and arrangement in connexion with the newborn purpose. These gentlemen had free access to our establishments, and finally determined to copy the American principles of manufacture throughout. Tyo do this, they engaged James M3L Burton, for some years chief engineer and mechanic at the Harpers' Ferry (Va) armoury totalbcea likep;osition in the new E:ngish armourv, and he is noe in that contry in the discharge ofitsduties They also ordered, built here, completedsetof theamahs eryinuse at our atmouries. Bobbins and tawrence, of Windsor, Vt, ere employed to build some 100 "imillingmachines," used to cut the gunlocks and executett otherironopartraf the gun. Trhese are a common machine, in this country at least, and were some months since completed and sent abroad. -This branch of the oontract amountedto some $30,000 or $40,000. Bfut the more important and intricate machinery-that for the manufacturAe of the gun stock-wras intrusted to the Ames M1anufacturing C6mpan'y of Chicopee. This has been just ccmpleted, and was despatched to England in the steamer of this week- The elements of national snd local pride enter so -largely into this lot of machinery that we may be excused for spealdng of it with some speciality. It consists of 25 different machines, three of which are duplicates. The rest constitute "the set," and through each of them doessthe gun stolc have to pass in the manufacture. The machinery is capable of turning out 250 stocks per day, each machine requnirmgthe average of a minute to execute its peculiar ofice. The cost to the English Government of this .supeb lotaof machnery is about $50,000. Mr. Oramel Clarke, one of the best werkrlsen in the stockingh depattinint of the armoiry, lss been employed to go out to Europe, and take the: chrge of the oacblnry and its oPration. The neS G6vernment irmoury of England, into which this mschinerj ind its', few operations ire to be introduced, is located at Enfield-lock, nine mailes north of London. It is intended ultimate], te employr 800 operatives, and turn out 500 muskets daiy. Captain H. J. WY.

But onthatonemy-feeline of -the necessity of comin to a sound conclusion, inasmuch as a great doctrine of tho church is implicated in it, is sq imtron -that I should be unfaithful to the church, and uncandid to-you if Idid not openly avow my dissent. Perhaps you willbe surprised at my sayingtLtitibyourdeieionthat credence tables are illegal which appears to me pregnant with serious consequences. It happened to myself a few years ago to have a complaint.brought to me against a clergyman for putting a credence table within the chanceL My judg- mont in that case ws,-' Change the name of the table,i but let the table iteelf remain.' This, I realy think, 'Was substantially the fittest decision I cotld make. It gave a triumph to neither party; that was certainly "Iell; it Was disagreeable to both par that too, probabry, was not ilL If 1 had been applied to before such a tble was'set up to solve a doabt between tbis clergyman and somo of his paN rishioners, how he ws 'to do and execute' the direction of the rubric introduced for the first time in 1662,-' and ;when there is a oormmunion the priest shall then (after the offertory sentences) place upon the table so much bread and wine as heshall thinkrequisite,'-itisverylikelvthatIshould have said, 'Put the bread and wine upon somo table within easy reach, that you may be able,withl6astinsonvenience or unseemliness, to plac them on the Lord's table at the time comuanded by the rubric.' If any person had been so igorant as to object to the second table sw Popish, I should havo endeavoured to convince thom of the contrary. I should iave told them that a second table is not of necessary, - rior even of ordinary, use in the service of the mass. Whether, indeed, the name 'Credence! or tho thing be of Roman orin is by no moans certai. Those who so consider it ascribe it to a frightful stato of manners in the 15th and 16th centuries when moro than one person of eminence were believed to have been cutoff by poison introduced into the Host. . . . . I think it mnuch more fitting that the bread, before the oblation of it is made, by being placed by the priest on the holy table, should be within .each on a sideboard,' or any unpretending but decent piece of furniture, than that it should be then brought from the vestry; for, if this be done by the clerk or tho churchwarden, some very iuseemly though not ill-intended practices may occur. Ihave heard of the loaf bem- brought by the churchwarden in a pockethandkorchicf. lor should webs safe; indoed, I think we should be in greater danger from the more highly ceremonial party. The brin'ulrthe elements to tho holy table nsight be by a prcession o a somewhat more exciting kind than some of the more cold-blooded among us would quite like. In theGreek churchitiabrought ina ceremonial manner, I believe by the priest and deacon, from the Prothesis, in which I see no harm." Having adverted to the 20th Canuon and the rubric insorted in 1I62, and briefly considered their provisions, the Blshop says.- "The real intention of the rubric was to enforce the Church's doctrine of tho Eucharist in one of its not least important particulars-to enforce an oblation of bread andwine in thankful acknowlodgment of the Great Author and Giver of all good things, in order that, with the elemernts thus made sacred by being offered to God and placed on His holy table, which (we know from our Lord's ovn words) ' sanchifieth the gfits placed upon it' we may make commemoration of the sacrifice of His death. In this blessed feast at God's table-' God's board,' as our church was wont to call it-a more endearing, aye, and when well considered, a far more solemn name than altarfor altar rclates to the sacrifice, while God's table implies tho blessed consequences of that sacrifloe-Christ' flesh made to us etemal life, feeding our souls and bodies with the food of immortality, making us 'one with Him'-in this blessed feast, at the table of God, we are God's guests, we have our reconciliation with Him sealed to us, in feeding on the sacrifice of the I.Amb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. . . . . . . You have in your late judgment condemned the mode in which this (the placin of the elements, before consertion) waa provided for at St. Paul's and at St. Barnabas. You state that you came to this decision because you were bound to obey the judgment of the superior court-the Court of A rches-in the case of 'Faulkner v. iAchfield.' Pardon me if I say that I am sorry you thoughtyonrself so fettered- our-on consideration, if left to itself, must, Ithink, hav ed you to a different conclusion. Pardon me, too, if I presume to add that I do not construe the judgment of Sir IL J. Fust, in the cse referred to, in the same manner as you do. The question under the consideration of that very able and learned judge was not whether any table within the rails for the purpose of holding the elements before the oblation, and in order to the oblation of tlem by the priest, was illegal simpliciter, butwhether a strueture of stone standing near to a stone altar (which was clearly illegal) ehould have the express sanction of the Court, in opposition to the earnest wish of the minister of the parsh, and in affirEnanoe of the will of. the ehurchwardens in opposition to his-whether, in short, the Court of Arches should confirm a faculty of the Consistorial Court of Ely, the effect of which would be to deprive the minister of St. Sepulchre's of the discertion which the absencoe of all express or implied direction in the canons of the church, the rabries of the Prayer-book, or any other known law had'left to him ? Sir H. T. Fust said,' I will do no such thing.' You, I think, would have said the sime; but you would not, I think, have coupled your saying this with words the looseneas of which is a little contrary to Sir Herbert's wont - After inquiring into the origin and meaning of credence table, the result of which inquiry was not very satisfactory even to himself, as ho fairly said, and not attempting to give any reason why a credence table, qvd credence table, should be deemed illegal, he. adds-II am of opinion that the eredence table must follow the same principle as the other.' Now, what was the other! A stone altar immovable." The Bishop next adverts to tho coverings for the communion table, which occupied so material a part of Dr. Lusihington's judgment. He says,- " To a variety of oovers for the holy table, earried to a fantastic orgreat extent, I am, speaking of myself personally, opposed in taste and judgment. But I know not when or where the excess can be said to be culpable. You cut the knot bysaying there shall bo onlyone. Now, this oondemns a black cloth in Lent no less than ever-varying exhibitions of covering. I frankly say that I do not assent to the entirepropriety of such a dooision. If anything of this sort is carried to such an extent as the Constoriil Court of the bishop shall deem inconsistent with due solemnity, that sourt will very properly restrain the usage. But the absolute prohibition of all variety on all occasions seems to me of very questionable fitness. A mournmng over, for instanoe, wrould seem very appropriate to a season of mourning or humiliation. I should as soon think of condemning the compilers of special services for prescnrbing penitential psalms or prayers on days when we humbl aclnowledge the judgments of God in visiting us wlth war or pestileneo or famine, and jubilant psalms and thanksgivings when He restores to us plenty and health and peace. Again. You decree that the churchwardens shaU substitute only one covering for such purnose, of silk or other decent stufE Shall I be forgiven if I here venture to suggest a doubt (if I was writing to a le eminent person I should not say - a doubt') whether you have not exoeeded, and even misstated, most unintentionally, the very words of the 82d Canon ? Thoee words are not simply ' a coverin of siLk' or other decent stuff, but a 'carpet of silk or other decent stuff.' And tho Latin is, perhaps, still -stronger- x pex aserico.' Now, 'carpe of s-' or 'UIpete ez so-ico,' indicated, in the reign of James L, a much higher grade of ornament than a covering of silk There remain to us specimens of the massive, costly, highly wrought, richly-embroidered tapetes of those days. Not long ago, but long before these matters were questioned in courts of law, one of mycountry clergy showed to me an ancient specimen belonginzg his church of thick silk stuff, highly-wrought with gold flowers. In truth, the meaning of the words of the canon would not be qulte satisfied with a mere ' ooverng of silk.' I certinly should not think it necessary to censure such a covering-unless, as is very possible, and, I am afraid, not very improbable-in the reaction of which your judgament may very perversely be made the cause-I should not, I say, censure a rRere covering of ilk, mnless in a wealthy parish there was an ostentations display of scantiness or homelness in the silk covering itself. I should otherwise be inclined to leave the matter to the sense of fitness in the parties themselves. EBut still less should I think myself at liberty to blame a parish or parishioner for placing even a sumptuous carpet of silk or velret, or other rich stufE, for the very richest material would appear to me 'co'sgrzez es dce@ in ornamenting the lIouse of God, esoecidly His own holv table. I have not correctly readeithor TheOldorNewTestamentif I do net-find That the spirit of beth is in favour of costly contributions to even the excternals of God's worship. . . As to your decree ' that there shall be only one lovering for the coeimunion-table' when it is not prepared for o6y Communion, permit me to say that the fitness of usin in divine servioe things of different quality and appearance, accordin to differerce of days or seasons, was distinctly recognised and- acted upon down to the very end of Kig EBdward's reign. Shortly before that period we knowr that commissions were issued ' to persons of condition in *very county,'. requiring them to seize all- manner of church gods, plate, Jewels, bells, and ornaments, leaving, nevertheless, .' one, two, or more chalices -or cups, acoordinir te the mnultitudo of the people in -every ni church or chap,' and also 'such other ornamentsas bytheir discretion shall seem requisite for the Divine service for the time.' Burnet thinks it right to exouse the young Kings share in this matter by sayymg that it wsa represented to hm as orly calling for the supetfuous plate and other goods that lay in the church more foi pomp than for use. *and-he adds thatEdward was in his last sickne (indee& he died within a feww eels afterwards)I 'in which it is not likely that he mindod affairs of that kxindinuch, hutset his hand easily to such papers as the Council prep«red for him.' hatthe30 oomiissions, thus issued atehe idding of-the greedy coutiers who hovered round the couch of their dying rince, eaTer to mdco the most of the short time left to them, Were not executed with any eiocss of liberality all our church hisorians attest-Fuller, Heylin Burnet, Col lier; and, we cAn'very readily believe them. . .Bnt I refer to quheseconinisstInssieplytecauseTheiri"ults,sCfarawepos. esethernfm,mtbeheldtothrowmuchlighcornthe-s-ryobscuru question what 'wrere theo ornabments iri ~this Church of Englnd in the second year of King Edwxard VI.,' five years before:these cormmsionas issued." jThe Bishop refers te tw doemonimts of tbnf dato, one showig that thd ommg,menta in St. Paul's Cathedral ware basins (sidlor for or~diny use, ar.d gilt for feetivals) chalies, sllver pete, a~ na}ey CrPet- for-the- cmnualon-tabl,--albs,- cubhions,--a&.-and one howing-w&trwerithe ornaments at LneoolCathbdraL] w ao onceive," contJenues his lordship, "that this princile Iws wasappiieaod eto Ate? ustit sot have-extendeX to ls costly inatt@r;s the coverings of the L6rd's tAble, as wiel as the vessel which were to be used at ill.?

Tho next point treated of by the Bishop is the vestments of minisers, vwhich may be used, and then reverted to the subject of crosses, as mentioned in the Lincoln Inventory. " I will not undertale," says the Bisho.p, " to determine whether the mention of a cross in that instrument affords any, or what degreD of proof that crosses were in the Church of England in- tho second year of thit King ; or; inotherwMords, four or five years earlier, when we know that there did not exist in our church that suspicion and Jealousy of the use of crosses which not long afterwards prevailed (for in the First Book of Edward, direction is given to the minister to cross himself at certain places, and permission is given at othef times to do so as every mans devotion serreth-a direction anxd a permission which were oemitted in the second book). But, I will say that if these matters had be.n brought to my notice in 1847, had I rememlered that hbishop Parker and Bishop Cox, of Ely, one of the compilers of the Book of Common Prayer, were disputants in favour of the cross ag t Grindall and Jewell; if, too, I had then seen evnioe which has since been given to the world, of crosses bein' part of the furniture of some parochial churches in the sixth ;year of Edward VIL, Ishouldihave hesitated before Idecided that crosses, as a church ornament, were not in the Church of England in the second year of Edward VL, and I should probably have taken the safer and wiser conrse of ruling that a minister to whom the law does not give the charge of the ornanients of the church, or any special right over them, violated tho law of the church by placing the cross on the Lord's table, in spocial preparation for the Holy Communion, in the face of his bishop, and in despite of that bishop's repeated warninga to him not to offend the already exciteda feelinos of his congregation by the introduction of useless novelties, whether in the -service or in the decoration of his church. I wish I had had tho benefit of an argument of counsel in the cause ; that would probably have saved me from tho error, if it were an error, into which I felL In saying what I have now said on this matter of crosss, I wish to be understood as not having son ght to impugn your decision in the same matter. . . . You took other matters into account, especially the evidence arising from the conduct and orders of the bishops of Qucen ElizabOth's reign. The value of that eidence I would not venture to discuss with you as folly as the subject may deserve. But being thus called upon to come to an opinion upon it, I must franl3;y onv tat I cannot assent to yous. Justice to the memory of a Sovereign to whom the cause of real reformation owes so much, as it does to Queen Elizabethjustice, too, to a cause, as dear to you as to me-the cause oi truth-compels me to reclaim against any statement of her desire to exalt her prerogative in these matters above the law, and of the anxiety of Archbishop Grindall, Bishop Jewell, and others to keep her within the law. I wfil cite only ono passage from the pen of Bishop Jewell, written to his friend Peter ILartyr, in a letter dated April 14, 1559, some months later than the date of the Act of Uniformity. 'This woman,' says Jewell, 'excelent as she is, and earnest in the cause of true religion, notwith-. standing she desires a thorough change as early as possible, cannot, however, be induced to effect such change without the sanction of law, but the matter'should seem to have been accomplished not so much by the judgment of discreet men as in compliance with the impulse of a furious multitude.'" The Bishop thus concludes B:-"Bt I quit a topic which I own is tempting to me, and return to the sabject with which I am more particularly engaged. Let me say, then, that I should not have presumed to refer at al to my judgment in 1847, had you not done me the honour of noticing it in terms which I could little have anticipated. To the princlple on which it wa founded I still adhere, and vith increased conAdence, becauseit has the support ofyour very high authorityI stil hold that no one can legally introduce ornaments into our churches, unless he can shovw by reasonable evidence that they 'were in use in the Church of England in the second year of King Edward VL,' for I think that all novelties of this kind are p7imd facie to be deemned illegal. Bat enough-I fear you will think more than enough of this. I should not have troubled myself or you with writing, if altar cloths, or crosses, or other church ornamonte only were concerned. I was impelled to my task by a consideration of a graver kind, to which I now returm,-the great Catholic doctrine and duty connected with the oblation of the elements. I am well aware that the very word ' oblation,' when any real sense is applied to it, grates npon the feelings of many. To the Protestant associations and Protostant aliances of this enlightened age It sounds as a mere abomination. To these, and sach as these, I write not. But to the earnest and single-minded searcher after truth in the spirit of Christian humbleness and charity I will address mself in a fewr sentences, not of my own, but of one who was 230 years ago among the moet saccessful adversaries of Rome. (Here fellowr lengthened extracts from Mlede's C?iristicsi Saer-iice.) He must be a bolder man than I am who would venture to add. a single word in the way of ilustration or-of comment. The real andintelligentProtestnt-he who is oontentwith protesting against what are, indeed, thecorruptionsofRome, willreceive itwithmorethanrespect-vithwiUlnEandthankfulobedience tothepreceptwhichitconveys. An yetwhhHe I v;rite this, pauthl it i3 to re'dect onthc many veyasntc serare presented. to us of (I wiU net Say ilful, I may not say ignorant, but I must at least say) heedless culpablyheedless inattention to a very plain law of the church, made for the very purpose of securing the due performance of that service the omission of wh-ich in Mede's time is treated by him so gravely. If we go through the churches of the metropolsye, or if we go through the cathedrals of the landit is painfulto see how few there are (my own cathedral at Exeter I rejoice to say is one of the few) in wbich the church's law is observed, that the bread and wine be not placed on the holy table tll the priebt makes, andin order that he may make, the oblation of them. To those who direct the worship in those noble temples-to our dens and dignitarie-shall I be forgiven if, without maidng special reference to any, I venture to address a word of reminiscenre to all? Cathedrals are not merely places of ornate, elaborate, sumptuous worship. .They were designed to be-ther ought to be exemplary to the diocess at large. lfowr, carelessneass in those wrho undertako the duty of setting an exmple of dutiful obedience to the orders of the church is something worse than carelessness-it is positive neglect of one of t not many or very onerous duties which specialy belong to their offices, and for the dischare of which tbcse who hold them are not commonly all remunerated. Theeo bffices are, in these days, exposed sometimes to invidious criticism and to inquiries into the reasons for which they are retained. Is the defence of them made more easy to those who wish to defend them by this too frequent disseeard of avery manifestduty, to which I thus ventureto so cit attention? r are we to'be told that the age will not bear these thingq,-that observances such as this, the want of which Mede, in his days, so feelingly deplored; -which our whole church, in 1662, deliberately adopted and ordained ; which, the greatest of our divines since that time-Bishop Patrick, in his Christian Sacrificc; Bishop Bull (MalZeus Hteuornm), i:nhisLeerin eswicr to TAeBishop of 3 sx; Bishop Nelson, 0m (ke Lordg Supper-have all exulted in adducing as evidenco of our union with the primitive church against the innovations of Rome ; are we, I wk, tolbetold that ordihances snuh as this wil now be opposed by many of the nobe, niany of the powerful, not a few even of the professed statesmen of the day? That rampantProtestantismi rejoices in fixing usly namBes on those who hold them, and homahir en the ignorant multitude to give even more substantial marks of their displeawsure-in !plain English, are we to be wold that these things are very unpopular? But is it the church's business to be popular ? Is popularity the best test o} its usefulness? There was once a teacher (was saidlI 1 Blessed isfHis holy name lthere is ateacher, for His word is. an everliving -word, who wrned.

Dr. Letheby then informed the comminssioners that the medicas gentlemen connected with the unions had ceased to supply hnu with the sanitary intormnation which had been considered necessary bv his Predecesor in order to suply an accurate estimate of the state of the public kealth.

As a member of the profesaion, he felt, lie said, that the resolution to withhold information isaportantto the public health was extremely illiberal, and he could not help expressing his surprise at the cour-se 'tak-en by the repectable mnen who had authorized so objectionable a emnn ation.

He thought it gould be wise to leave the medical officers of the unions in the hands of the guardians, who were as anious to discharge-tbeir duties as the Commissioners of Sew;ers wre to perform the functions allotted to them, and he agreed with 3r.

Alderman KE'yEDY wislhed to Inow the extent of the informationthe medical gentlemen were reqmred to give, .and what trouble it would give tLem to supply it. He wished to know whether they did not make returns to the boards of gaardians, and wbethser auythenp,nore than-copies of those returns were reuired bv the, Medical Officer of U{ealth of the city of London ? (Hear, hear.) Dr. Ltheby said, the medical gentlemen wero not asked 'or professional opinions.
