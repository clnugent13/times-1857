The discussion vas generally of a congratulatory ehsseter, the only point brought under promilnent consideration being the appropriation of 15,0001. to the reserve fund.

The maeasures now pro. posed 'were the last that were needed to place the line and plant in an efficient condition. By the act of Parliament nstpassedthey'were authorized to raise ne capital to, miNed extent to clear themn of their liabilities.

Hie apprehended there could be Out one Opinion as to the propnety of the earliest possible timo being taken for raising the money, iaasmuch as the benefit to be derived from the new capital would be immediate. and because so long as the new capital was not raised their dificulties would continue. It was proposedto raise one-half only of the capital at thepresent time by shares guaranteed at the rate of five per cent, per aiinuninopetuita . The directorsmnigbtperbapsbxveraii thecapi at a somewbatless guarantee, orthey might have saddled it with conditions of redemption by which they might have ultimiately got rid of the guarantee altogether. It had been obmectedtbat the present bolders of preference stock were not entitled to their -ateable shares in this new capital. Re thought this objection was formed on erroneousgroun'ds. The holdersof preference stock were, in point of fact, the representatives of the ordinary sto4K Rle thought itwas but fair that theguaranteed stock-olders should have their share of any benefit that might be derived frorn th new stock. This meeting was one that would crown -the -efforts 'which the directors bad made to place the railway in a safe and permanent condition. The chairman then proposed .a series of resolutions, cancelling forfeited shares, creating new capital to the extent of 2250,01... and' proposing to aJlocate the new stock among shareholders ho ding I001t and upwards. Fr. F. CnLL expressed his dissent from theprinciple of giving any partci ation in the newr stock to the preference shareholders. Re thought the original shareholders had sufferedmniost, and 'were alone entitled to any The CrAnArm 'said that his wish was to preserve harmony amonng the shareholders, which would have been disturbed had one class of them been excluded from participation in the new stock.' The various resolttions 'were then agreed to. The Cini_Lm. then proposed a resolution spproving the -working agreement entered into with the Selkirk and Galashiels Rai1vay.'

There -is a -third, known for his curiois cormmentary on foolscap paper, w-ho might join -his wiseir brethr6n and give us additional ground of satisfaction. Whle, 'hot%'ever, these ivo ise episcopal abdications commaild our= tesect,' afid.the'third. cas ':tw which I have alluded may yet, I truit spee'dily do so, I thinlk we may be permitted to compare the lot o£ the working clergy, wvhen wcvked outj-:with hesebrighter lights whose oil is failing. If the rector O Broadbean-cum- Appleton survives his-next birthday he' willbe 81 -lis income his -been, for the 48 years of his present incumbency, a non-mmal 4001. a-year, subject to all manner of- oatgoin3gs. If he retires, i. e., resigns, he is a beggar ttv once, and out-relief is all he could bv law obtaiu, and this only as a farour from the board of guar dians, who respect hin highly. They know hi circumstances. lt is no0 secret that he could no' afford the 121. to the gentlemau whoo fixes false jaws "without springs" though he desired it from his heart, that he might be more dtinctly heard by This congregation. He has insured his life for the benefit: of the excellent woman who has: long 'shred his cares and toils, should 'she survive him; -the only hope hia old maiden-because portiolessdaughter has offuture iubsistence- is also from this insurance, and:the sale in prospect of his library df ancient Fathers. If he retires how is he to keep up his policy of insurance? As the bill for the future support of the Bishops of' London and Durham is brought in by what is called "the present Government," I have every hope that it vill follow the, fate of other measures so unfortuiately begotten t6-be'Mfimfately deseied, otherwise I think I oould easily undertake to show that it is in principle as-iujiust as at this momentit is in-policy most inexpedient;-- - with what consistency can Church or State be ta xed to give higgh pensions in. these cases, on the simple ground that the pensioners are aged, infir, or even altogether incapable-? Is age-is infirmity -nay, is incapacity good ground for the retirement on pension of a bishop? If so, surely it is as good ground in the case of such a rector as I have described above. But then, if the Bench admait this, how is it that they do not hold extreme age, positive infirmity, . evident incapacity to be grounds onz |whicA to refiise the i71 titutk of cZergynen to, li inso A:Bishop of London orDurham is to be pensioned and released from further toil on accounat of the very physical and moral causes which -have within these few yeas made, and may yet make, many clergyIman most eligible for an in unibency.

The mail steamship Baltic was passed by the Atlantic at 11 p.m. on the 5th inst. * Both Houses of Congress have been occupied with bills providing for the admission of Kansas; In the ;enate Mr. Douglas (Administration) introduced a bill providing for a census, under the direction of -the President, and for elections under that census. This was under discussion on the 2d of July, and *was passed Late that night. Mr. Toombs, of Gleorgia(Democrat), said he "believed that MIr. ;eward and his coadjutors wanted grievances -and discord, and nothing but revolution to obtain power. He would offer to the country the evidence of these facts. When he (Toombs) sub-xitted the pure ballot-box, with all that honour ,could throw around it, with the entire mili- tary iorce of this great country to protect it, he ~WBS met by the tender from Mr. Wilson, backed by 3Ir. Seward, of the cartridge-box. If he believed {they represented the feelings of the Nlorth, he 'would withdraw his bill, and accept that issue. If he believed the free States were ready for that he would be content. He had no compromise %to offer but principle, but he didnotbelieve that these men represented the feelings of the North. Re did not know what claim they had to speak -for the North. He had no 'higher law.' He -despized the man and he looked upon him a a wretchb who would steep his conscience in perjury in order to get advantages from place in the HouEe of Representatives." The admisaion of Kansas as a free State passed by a majority of one the same night. The Congressional Committee had rettuned to Washington and made their report to the House on the 1st of July. It is only the report of the maJority. It is supposed that the minority report will fa*our the Missouri invaders and the administration. mhe majority report concludes as follows "Your committee report the following-facts and conclu-' nions as established by-the testimony- - "1 L That eaclh election the territory held. under the or-, ganic or alleged territoriallaw has been carried by organized invasions from the State of hlissouri, by which the people -of the territory have been prevented from exercising the ights secured to them by the organic law. " 2. That the alleged territorial legislature was an illegally -constituted body, had no power to pass valid laws, and their enactments are therefore nul and void. "3. That these alleged laws have not, as a general thing. beens ued to protect persnos anc properby and to punish 'wrong, but for unlawful purposes. "4. That the election under -which the sitting delegate, -4Fohn W.

" 6. That Andrewv If. Reeder recived a greater number -of votes of resident citizens than John W. Whitfield for -delegate. "-7. That in the present conditions of the territory a fair election cannot be held, without a new census, a stringent and well-guarded election law, the selection of impartial judges, and the presence of United States' troops at every pie of election.- " S, That the various elections held by the people of the territory preliminary to''the formation of the State Go-vemment have been a3 reguiar.as the disturbed condition of the terrtory would allow; and the constitution passed by the convention held in pursuance of the said elections -ebodiesthe wil of amajority of the people.

I- do not aee, however, that the- despatch containing their nomination announcea at the same time their accepta'ce; 1. only lopetliat it will soon cdo so. The first combination was- aModerado with a slight shade; but the -addition to 'it contains a Liberal element. Lizuriaga, who was the predecessor of General-Zabala in; the Foreigir Department, under the presidency of- Espartero, is a--Liberal of the good old h'oaest. school, of unimpeached and unimpeaclable probity, political ind personaL Hardly a party that--has succeededto power in Spain for years past, however divergent or hostile to each other, however- tolraziitbr periseuting, however inorid or base, from Calatrava at one, extreme to Sartorius at the" other, that has not voluntarily, or in spite of their second- nature;,borne testimony to the civic virtues of Luzuriaga. Honest men wished to adorn still more their honesty by his presence, -and knaves to hide' their msiisdeeds under the shailow of his reputation. When they could not have him in the Government they would hname him President of the Supreme Cort'-of Justice-a post which -he has filled for a-considerable-time. - Mi. Bayarri is, comparatively speaking, a nev man; but, - araong 'men of probity and honouf, he i sapoken well of. He lills the post of Secretarytto the Cortes, and was chosen by the Liberal party for that o9fice. - -. Josd Manuel Collado is - already known. to the public. He was -for, some months Minister of Finance in the Espartero Administration, but his spirit and strength gave way before the Herculean labour of regulating the Spanish finances, and providing, under adverse circamstances, and with a treazury that had been drained to the last- by profligates and adventurers, for the exigencies of the public service. He is a native of San Sebastian, the son of apoor fisherman, -andthefabricator of his own fortune, which is considerable, by many years of successful industry. As I have already observed, it is not enough that these men have been named - we must know that they - have accepted, and are likely to remain, either themselves, or same others like them, before we can be sure that Snain - will pass through the crisis free from serioins troubles. The motives must be stronig indeed which vwoiald induce M. Luzuriaga, a most devoted friend of Espartero, to accept a place in a Cabinet which that admired friend had quitted, and to serve under a leader who, if not an adversary, is at least a jealous and successful rival. His8 presence and that- of the-two others of his party are the only guarantee I see against reaction of the worst kind, for O'Donnell attaches much the same meaning to " firmness and energy" as another once celebrated political leader, who, gorged with wealth and honours, has grown torpid from very plethora. By " firmness and energy" both mean the disregard of life, liberty, or Constitution, when either stands in their way, and when they can with impunity get rid of them. Difficult asit is to predicate anything of Spain I should yet venture to affirm that even O'Donnell, with an exclusively reactionary Cabinet, would be powerless to govern long without a civil war. According to a private despatch from Madrid, the first step O'Donnell was expected to take would be the immediate disarming of the National Guard, and that immediate insurrections were expected in the provinces. It was also rumoured that Espartero would set out for Logrono. Reverting- to the affair of Escos-ora, it appears that immediately on O'Donnell's demanding that Mfinister's dismissal Espartero went to the Queen and told Her Majesty somewhat "brvsquemenat" that she must choose between O'Donnell and himself. The Queen begged him to retract this requisition and not to force -her to make such a choice, Espartero insisted, and then the Queen said she could not consent to the resignation of O'Donnell, on which Espartero declared his intention of retiringfrom the Ministxy. It was said at Madrid that the Queen acted under the advice of the French Ambassador, for she personally likes Espartero much better than. O'Donnell. On the whole, it is rather lucky that the English Ambassador was absent, for he must either have opposed the French influence, and thereby damaged the erdede cordiale, or else have silently and humbly sided with kl. Turgot, and abandoned all English traditional feeling and preferences in Spain. I may add, that neither the Mloziteur nor the other Paris papers of this inorning hint a word of the crisis in Madrid.~ I am assured that the statements in some of the German and French papers about France abandoning the idea of the union of the Danubian Princi.palities under one sole government are totally in- founded. - On the contrary, France, as well as-! England, Prussia, and Russia, continues to believe I that such union is the best combination; and the only case-an unlikely 'one, - it is true-which would prevent those Powers froa cryming out their object would be that of the. Moldo-Wallachians1 themselves declaring for the continuance of the separation. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received :- L " MRSEILES, JULY 15.

PRUSSIA. (mROU oUR OWN cORRESPONDENr) BERLIt, JaY 14. 'he only cloud that is at present visible above the horizon of German politics, and whichthreatens to any extent to interrupt the monotonous serenity that for some time paet. has prevailed there, is-the subject that has lately called forth remonstrances to the Government of Denmark from those of -Prussia and Austria, viz., tho sales that the former is making of State domains in. the German Duchies of Holstein . and Lauenburg. In pursuanea of the grand scheme which was first promulgated in Copen*hagen in 1854 for uniting a}l the component parts of the Danish monarchy into one entire State, the present Ministry of that counatry have transgressed the bounds which the mere personal union of the German :Duchies with the Crown of Denmark prescribes, andwhich were formally recognized and provided for in the treaty of peace concluded betwveen Germany and Denmark in 1850. The changes proposed by the open letter of the King of Denmark to tie Duchies in 1846, which gave the first impulse to the rising in 1848, were a very insignificant trifle indeed compared to what the Duchies. have had to put up 'with from the advisers of their Duke, the King of Denraark, since the peace vwas concluded .whic-h was intended to secure them their rights and their separate existence; but neitner this present act of most self-evident breach of treaty nor the long-continued course of oppression and inljustieo that these "conquered provinces" have had of late to sustain at the hands of Denmark, is likely to 'lead to another outbreak. Priussia will not again attempt to vindicate her pre-. tension to be called "the sword of Germany" by puttingaher troops atthe service of central Federal Power to enforce its hehests against offending Denmark, nor is A ustria- likely to send her-forces again across the wrhole wridth of£ Germany to complete the "pacification" of the Duchies, for the diplomatic relations between Austria and Denmark have been for -some time past of the coolest, ever since the Austrian Minister at Copenhagen took part in the European agitation against Russia, and split upon the rock of the overwhelming Russian influence at that Court. Ever since that time Austria has only been represented inthe Danish eapital bya a charg d'affaires. The course that the affair appears at present most likely to take will be, that the Danish G:overnment will go on " never minding," and will carry out its fusing the German Dachy of HIolstein together .vwith the Duchy of Schleswig, of which some maintain that it also is originally wholly or partially German territory, into the " entire monarchy" of Denmark, while Prussia and Austria, instead of uniting to convince Europe of Germany's right and convict Denmark of the -wrong she is doing, will only turn the incident toaccount for the production of political capital in Germany; each will from time to time send off a diplomatic remonstrance and protest to Denmark, who will answer them or not, as convenient, and then call upon the rest of.Germany to regsxd her (austria or Prussia, as the case may be) -as the champion of Germnan interests. -.As you will have learnt from lefters of mine now inore than a month back, Prussia addressed a remonstrance to the Danish Government on this subject in . a despatch to the Prussian Minister at Copenhagen dated June i, and acconmpanied it with a memorial which had been completed during the preceding month of May, On occasion of its being forwarded to its destination a copy o£ -it was communicated to the Austrian Government, which, on the 23d of the same month,forwrarded a despatch of similar import -to its own representative in the Danish capitaL. Up tothe present time the Danish Governmnent has not vouch-. afed any answer to either the one or the other, and will, probably, find it- nost convenient to vwithhold any commnunication of the sort until applied :to -.by the organ of the Federal I?nion, the Diet sitting at Frank!ort.

The Prussian despatch was dated June. 1, the Austri;ai Jue2f --0 D 0 - - - - 7 B1JUCHAREST, JULY 5. The following are full and, authentic particulara: -of theomu,rder (for. such-it is). of a-Erench'soldie4,' which i mentionod in a- hurried postseript to my letter of the 1st inst.. A eonvoy of 30 Austriai waggons, escorted by 12 soldiers, under the' 'conimand of Lieutenant Ozack, halted for 'a day t Daya, one post -from Giurgevo. The 'soldiers 'were distributed through- the village,' and the lieutenarnt and a veterinary surgeon establishedethemselves iii -one of the two roois of 'the- little Wailachiai caare. Two French soldiers were in' the room. on the other side of the exitrance; a'third soldier, completing the small detachment allotted to the car of .the-.elegraph-at lthat.'place.-was cookingn ;the courar and was not mixed up in the affir. One of the Frenchmen wefit into the room occupied by the Austrians to fetch his dog, wv-hich- had got under a.divan. The officer.askedhimin German -why he-did-not take' off his cap. The soldier, not. understanding, asked-hini in French what he said, and was replied to-by-blows 'of a horsewhip. His cried out, and his comrade, seizing a bit of wood, eame in to his assistance. Thereupon the lieutenant, the veterinary -surgeon, and anl Aiustrian soldier who Waas present - drew their swords. The French -retreated to their hut, which was about 40 paces distant; one of them armed himself with a pistol, and they returned to the inn.- Three Austrian soldiers had . come in,-an angry discussion ensued in the Wallachian language, more Austrians arrived, who menaced the. French ' with their fists, and the veterinary surgeon, -who 'was smoking a chibouk, hit one of -the latter over the head with the pipestick, upon which the Frenchman pointed hispistol at him. Finally the French retired to their hut. Czack. sent for' a corporal and five soldiers, gave them cartridges, ordered them to load, and put- himself at their head, All this had occu-, pied about half' an hour. -The two 'Frenchmeii, who were in front of their hut, seeing the party of armed Austrians approach, wvent inside and shut the door. The Austriana tried to break it open, and finally took it off its hinges with their bayonets. But the doorway was very low, the Frenchmen defended it with levelled bayonets, and laughed at the summons of the officer to lay down their arms and yield themselves prisoners. The officer got furious at this, and attempted to-breach the rear of the hut, but there were beams which defied his efforts. He then ordered his men, whose numbers had augmented, to charge the doorway with the bayonet, but the adventure was perilous, -and they humg baclk. A corporal-tried to enter, but the French kept hi'm off. Then au-Austrian Grenadier watched his opportunity, and, making a sudden Splilg, seized the two French muskets by the muzzYe, hoping to hold them while, his comrades got in. A struggle ensued, aidc during this the corporal knelt down, passed his gun under the arm oftheGrenadier,and fired. At such olose quarters aim was sure; the ball entered under the seventh rib, traversed the heart, and came out under the-third rib on the other side. The unfortunate Frenchman uttered a single cry and fell dead. His coade then surrendered, and was kept' priso.ner -until- the. arrival of the French -Lieutenant, IrManfredi, commanding the detachment of the 231st Regiment, and for whom a telegraphic messago was immediately sent. M. Hory, Chancellor of the French Agency at Bucharest; M. B3aron, director of the French telegraph; the Austrian Major, Fries, and a surgeon were shortly on the spot -to investigate the affiair. The corporal who com-mitted thae murder is.in irons,-and Lieutenant Czack in arrest at Giurgevo, and themrnatterhas, of course, been duly reported to the proper authorities and to the -French Government. Count Coronini is, as might be expected, extremely distressed at thismost scandalous affair, and is related to have said that ho had rather the whole of the,12. hAustrians had been kiDed than the one French soldier. - The nationality of the victim, of course, makes all. the difference, and it is probable that this murder may make more 'noise thau all those perpetrated on Wallachians since the commencement of the AustAan occupation. ti p It is to be observed that the musket of one of the two Frenchmen who kept a dozen Austrians at bay for, it is said, nearly two hours was found to be unloaded; the other - had in -it a charge of small shot. A strong report was current in the town last evening of another bloody business near the Transylvanian frontier,: in -the neighbourhood of Predial. It comesin a very circumstantial form,'but some of the details -seem difficult to reconcile. A detachment of Anstriana returning to their country fell in with siwxgarde froti&reS, and insisted on their serving them as guides, thoughwhythey should need guides in order to follow the road is difficult to understand.- The Wallachians refused; shots were fired on bothsides, and two Austrians, according to some accounts, two Wallachians according to others, were killed or badly woinded. The skiriuiish ended, and the Walachians pursued their way, but were overtaken, it is said, by a party of nmounted Austrians,: who killed them all. The story is by no means improbable; but, if true, we shall, doubtless, soon receive further particulars. The plunder of the inn at Kalongaren by Austriah soldiers- on the march is fully confirmed.

The answer from -the Government of the 'Two Sicilies, or from -lIi Majesty-for they am one and the samne-will have been in England now nearlya, week. Perhaps. gou *ill have had an opportunity of reading it; if so,. in all probability you will have. found my version of it correct. .The right of interference will be disputed, the charges brought against this Government will be denounced as exaggeration; - a disposition will be expressed to give enlarged privilegea to the " amatissimi sudditi," but, alas! theyaresounfittedfor self-government that they still requirepaternal direction.

I HUKIT.Dr STATES. '- ( PoX Oti OWN OOPRNaorT.) - -NEW YORK, JTLY 5. The to lIoues Of' Congress have come.into direct collision inuregard-to the fate of Kansas. -In .m1Y last letter I gaveo ou the general purport of the Senate Billjfoz settling-the difficulties prevailing on the border-viz., the: organization. of an -entirel6 newGovernment, under the,auspices of the President-and the bayonets of th.e 'United States' troops, biecrinnini with a census,- and ending with a Constitution.' This plan, which has the appearance offairness onthe surface, is objected to by the Republicans, on the ground that the late atack uDonLaturence and the prevalence of bands of armed -men throughout Missouri and on the borders have, driven away the 'Free State men, and that a census taken now would exclude the real settlers from voting, and again put them umder the dominion from which they are now trying to escape... This biU was before' the Senate on Wednesday, and, after a. discussion ex'tending beyond midnight, personal and vituperative in pa was pase by a strict party vote, the Republicans voting " Nay," and Whigs' Democrats, and NativeAnericans votin 4'Yea." On their part the House have had what it alled the Topekl constitution under consideration-that is, the -'onstitution-made by the Free State men in v.iolation of law, and for accepting office under which 3Mr. lReeder'and Mr. Lane are under indictmient, and Mlr. Robinson in prison; as well ,as under indict.ment forhigh treason.. The -House' at -firit7 killed the bill by a majority of one, but on iefection gal. vanized it into life by .a vote of reconsideration, end, after a struggle, voted to admit the State of Kiansas under that constitution into the Union. Thus you will see that the House (which has under thetheory of this Government the Iey of the money chest) supports the men and the cause that thePrsident and the Senate pronounce treasonable. The friends of free Kansas seem 'to believe that the House will stand byits vote, even to a refusal of the appropriations, if necessary; bat I doubt much whether it will have-the courage to do so. : The majority report of the Kansas Investigating -Committee has been published. It gives the Free State side of the question, and the story on the other aide may change the colouring. A. $5the case stands in this report, there 'never was so disgraceful ani example of the working of republican and representative institutions. ll the- storiea of the invasion of "border ruffisiai? are milk and:water .compared withthe accounts here given, andpurporting to. be extracted from -the evidence. -The majority of the committee say that in the earliest stage of these proceedings, -before the Kansas -Bill passed'Congress, the lodges of a secret society were formed throughout the western part of the State of .Missouri for the-purpose of making Kansas a Slave State by force, if necossary.. They then give the account of the invasions of the territory in detail at each successive election-how the 1issourians crossed into the territory in armned bands hundreds strong the day or the day before each election-how they took possession of the polls; marching their men off in companies to the. different point as it was supposed they would be wanted, in order to get complete control of every precinct-how they drove away the- election judges appointed by the Governor and not friendly to their cause, pointing loadedrifes at their breasts, and giving them a few mioments to decide between death and the abandonment of duty-how they.pursued them with balls as they retreated-and how, with a violence, profanity, and bratality, given in coarse detail by ther e- port, they took possession of the Government of the territory and planted the Missburi laws there. They go' through the- elections district by district, and profess to be able to show the number of illegal votes cast in each. If their statements are. correct, instead of wondering that the Free State men rebelled, we rather wonder that they submitted so long. It is to be hoped thatthe minority report will explain away many of these charges. The committee conclude with eight propositions, of which the onlyimnportant one for European readers is that, "ITn th.e present condition of'the territory a fair election cannot be heldwithoult a new census, a stringent and well-guarded electioh law, the selection of. impartial judges, and- the' presence of United States' troops at every. place of election." The news brought by the Canada, of the complete settlement of the enlistment question, has had a favourable effect upon the-money-narket. MWoney was abundant before; but there was some distrust as to the future. The fancy stocks rose with the intelligence, andthe "bulls" looked brighterthanfor some time past. The news from' the interior continues favourable as to the crops. Everything promises a good yield; but it is not to be forgotten thaat in 1854 it wras the same. The great dought of that year began on the 4th of July. The interest of the State of'Cahifornla is still unprovided for. An attempt was made on Saturday to meetit by the guarantee of ColonelFremont, the republican candidate for the Presidency; but ~the ' effort-failed. It is known that the money was paid tOI Messrs. Palmer, Cook, and Co., the agents of the State, some time ago.' The public willnow look for their exolanation of the delay. The maemaber for California, who shot a waiter at ;Yillard's Hotel some weeks since, is under indictmentfor murder.. 'Had he been present, his vote woufld have been given against the Topeka constitutian.' - ' Yesterday was the 4th of July, thi anniversary of the declaration of national independence. As 'usual, the town was given np- to muskets, firecrackers,. rockets, and rowdiness from the night of. theS3dto this morniing.' An equestrian statue of Washington was inaugurated in the morning, being the first statue of the- ind in the-city. There oas a heavy thunder shower during the day.

PUBORASBE IN THB-ABRLY. TO THE EDITOR -OF TEE TInES. Sir,-A pamphlet-has lately been pizblished.b.t" A Colonel of Infantry," in support of the exis system of purchase in our army, upon which aRoyal. commianon is now sitting. "A Colonel of InfantWy" maintains that t&b_ system of purchase is as advantageous to men witlSout money as it is to men *ith money, inasmuch asr it aelerates ite curent of promotion and:'So. hurries the poor man along, in the 7rear of 'the! moneyedman, to the BIead of his rank:, in -w-hich posi tion a death vacancy may give hir his next ztp more rapidly than he woild havo attained it hsa seniority been.the rule instead of purchase.' But death vacancies are very rae in the Brifiai armyin peacetime;andit isinpeaotime alone th^ re must examine into the effects of the purchu4 svstem,for in wartme it speedily fals into abeyauce andeases to act. A sick officer generaly 'coni tarives to -sell out in time. to save for his family tim money le has invested ia his- commiions and few as the death vacancies are, it must be recollected that the many purchasing officers of our army have just-as good a chance of profiting by -them as the few non-purchasers. Therefore it is, iimd6ed, alb'ac lookout for men of merit withbut money if they Are to look only to their infinitesimaly small share of death vacancies for promotion. * We have at present 26 regiments of cavalry. :In them there are 63 field officers and 218 captains.- The executive officers of our cavlry 'regmments-ther adijtant and the riding-master-are generally mea who have risen by merit from the ranks. The majority of the other officers are young men who have enteredthe rvice to amuse theinAseles, without any intenti6n of maldng it a permanent profession. Th6ir merit has nothing whatever to do with their regimental promotion, which they buy -when their turn comes for buying it. It is, therefore, but fair to supDose that as cavalry officers, understanding and attendmg to the discipline and interior economy of their regiments, the executive officers to whom : have adverted are gen&illy the best, most earnest, and most experienced 3nenin our-service. Two of these offlicers to each of our 2t; regmuents of cavalry would give an aggregate of 52'non:pur. chasing, but avowedly meritorious and able men,' ever tending upwards, according to the " Colonel oA Infantry," and benefitting by the purchaese ayst8n' -advantageous, according to him, to the non-purchaser as to the purchaser. But Hares Army List for 1856 discloses the con-w: flicting fact that out of the 63 regimenutal field_ officers of the British cavalry 7not a single one belongs to the non-purchasing clas ; and, further; that out. of the 218 captains but eiglht are non-purchisers- - It is difficult to understand how a system'whickX thus excludes from even the higher regimenta;[ grades of the service the class of officers who areallowed to understand their profession best, and t, attend to it most sedulously, can. be held to be advantageous to that class. I wish the " Colonel of Infntry would explain this apparnt anomaly. We often hear, moreover, that officers of the' non-purchasing class are not so nfluential with the men as more Wealthy gentlemen are. If so, how comes it that they are invariably chosen by thei-r colonels as adjutants and riding-masters, positions which daily and hourly bring them in contact witTL the private soldiers, and in which personal influence would assist them so materially in the dischgage' of their duties ? Moneyed men, -who can afford to be openhandedT to those whom they command, who have too many distractions to allow them to attend very strictly to, the details of a profession which most of them loakl upon only as a pastime to-be laid aside wvhen conve-' nient, may be, and probably are, the most populirclass of offlicers at homre in peace time. Their mem maytake a pride is seeing them ride 200 5uineahorses, drive four-in-hand, and cut a figrem - ther grandmilitay steplechase, but-when real war work iS to be done, I believe that-we dothe 3British soldier an ijustice in suppoing that he has not sufficient discerinuent to nderstand and appreciate the leader' who knows his duty best and does it most earnestly and gallantly, no matter whether he be a purchaser or a non-purchaser, a nobleman who has paid thonsands for his commismions, or a soldier of meritwh% has risen solely by that nlerit from the-ranks.- And f Isn rightin this supposition I wi:a hiat "A Colonel of lufantry" would frther explain to me how a sytem, which pracically exclu s' the latter cl3ss of men from any but the lower grades of the service, can be either far to them or beneficial to the public service. - All military writers of-all-nations-concur-that, to be a first-rate - cavalry leader, requires ii -nusal combination of the highest military qualiie. The, wider the field of selection, the better- ch;an(e X. nation has of discovering.siich ix pruze. r . Observe how our purchase syxtenrrmnarows that field.

&qONDQ27, THUSDAY, JULY 17, 1856. Few more iniportant subjects have of late years 'been brought before the House of Commons than that which was introduced by. the FIRST LORD of the AD3aRAxri on Tnesday evening.. The state and prospects of the English navy can nevor become matters of inifference to English=en. Our extent of empire, the material -interests of our commerce, the consistency of our historical traditions, are all interwoven with, and deper,aent on, the. sufficiency and efficiency of cu- marine. We believe that there is not an Englisluman in any part of the worldwho would not feel that the policy which crippied or which did not xaaint our maritime force would be fatal to the -chtater of his country. We -can -never expect to; raS the numericaZ strength of our army beyond, that of second-rate Powers. Our con- titutoi-1 happily precludes a compulsory en-ifimt?; - the ste of our labour-market and the average of wages make voluntary recruiting, too expenive an operation to be employed ona' 'Uge cae. We content oursves, therefore, with an armay not greater than that which defends weati and possessions far inferior to our own. But our insular position and insular tastes, while they demonstrate 'the necessity of maiuntaiing, a lso provide us with: the means of acquiring, a lTrger navy than the generality of our'neighbours. We cannot conceal from ourselves, however% that the facilities for supporting a navy commensurate to the'exigencies of our territory and our dignity;are not so great asthey once were, and as they are supposed to be now. 'arioui causes have .pontributed to this result. Our commerce has grown largely' of late yeas, and has considerably enhanced the demands of ourmercantilermarine. When'awar breaks ont, there immediately ewues a; competition between the Government and the merchant service, and the latter carries the day by dint of more tempting overtuires. Then the supply at home is more limited, owing to the great demzand for British seamen both in the United States and in the British colonies. A very large proportion of the United States' crews are of British orig;n. No small proportion of the sailors who formed part of Commodore PEBRY's s squadron .: to Japan were. Englishmen. A large intercolonial trade has 'sprung up of late years between the different - North American dependencies in one direction, and between the Cape,' MIauritius, Ceylon, Singapore, and. Australia ,in another. Thus, occupation for English seamen has increased in every quarter of the globe; and this has been so far from advantageous to their modesty and docility as a class, that the majority of shipowners in Europe prefer to compose their crews in a small ratio of iEglish, and in a much larger ratio of foreign sailors ; while the shipownersin our colonies and the East invariably 'ntroduce a very great admixture of Lascars. and Malays on board their ships. This competition, which extends 'beyond 'the confines of Europe, while it receives a strong impulse from the speculative and, energetic habits of our own countrymen, and is not diminished by the employment of European or Oriental sailors, imposes upon the British Goverment a duty not less 'difficult than it is imperative, 'when engaged in considering the means of maintaining an efficient navy. We believe that few persons in England were prepared for the statements made on the official authority not only of our own, but of foreign Admirals, that at, this moment not only Fance but Holland possesses a larger body of seamen for the purposes of protection and offence than we do. When we remember the great military resources for operations by land 'which France has displayed to the world, and then discover that she cau caU 60,000 trained seamen into action, the reflection must " give us pause." But when, in addition to this, we also find that, despite her small territory and inconsiderable population, despite the exhaustive effects of war and revolutions, despite a debt which,relativelyto her.resources, ismuchgreaterthan. our own, Eolland has actually a larger number of native sailors afloat than we have, we cannot resist a feeling of compunction that we have allowed considerations of economy to override interests of a kind and degree superior to all others. The necessity of malking up again the leeway which has been lost through our carelessnens or our parsimony will exempt from a rude or hostile criticism any reasonable project of the Government for maintaining in a state of tolerable efficiency the most important arm of our rational strength. The gravest objection that can be started against the plan of the Government is, that it is incomplete. It is only a half-measure, but, admitting this, we think we may also defend it on the plea that it is necessary as a preliminary to any other improvement, and that it is unexceptionable so far as it goes. Sir C. WooD proposes to transfer the Coastguard from the Cutoms to the Admiralty ; to increase its numbers gradually from 5,000 to 10,000; to diffuse it over diffierent parts of the coast at present unwatched and unprotected; to man 'with it the gunboats created by the requirements of the late war; to add to it the Naval Pensioners still capable of service, and thus to form a corps of reserve which shall never fall short of 10,000 men, and may in process of time exceed 15,000. This body will be available to man our ships at any time recruiting fails, but will not be required for the purposes of offensive war until all the ordinary means of supplying seamen for that object have- been exhausted. Besides these means we understand that it is Sir C. Woo's intention to increase the number of naval stations at home,' both in Scotland and Ireland, so as to familiarze the people on those coasts with the attractions and comforts of a QTm"s ship. With this plan, so far as it goes, we concur. The motives for introducing it are urgent. We have never wanted mat6riel. We have that in abundance. Large ships-magnificent machinery and gunnery-everything that can be fabricated out of wood and iron,-all that we have in abundance. What we have 'wanted is men. We have never entered even on a naval war with an adequate number of men. Nnasoc went to the Nile and the Baltic with many of his ships halfmanned. At the begining of the Russian war the British fleet was imperfectly manned in number, and still more in quality. This is strange, considering the naval prestige of the country, and the maritime tastes of the larger part-nay, indeed the whole-of our population. It can only be explained, as we said before, by the competition of our own merchant service, of the American mercantile and war marine, by the thousand cha-nnels of private adventure opened in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and by the stubborn pride of English independence. Against these antagonistic seductions it is tlio task of Government to provide an equivalent attraction; and we think that both the present and previous Governments have proceeded in the right direction to do this. Every sailor who has served consecutively in an English merchant vessel, an American merchantship or man of war, and a Que's ship, wil (unless smarting from some sevelity or injustice) declare that, whatever nominal distinctions there may be in favour of any other kind of service, the real and substantial advantages are far more nu)merous in an English man-of-war. Food, clealiness, comfort,, regularity, subordination-all these are to be found with greater certainty and in a greater degree, with less pretension, fuss, or ostentation, in the QuExs service than elsewhere; and, as the sea- faring inhabitants of our coasts become more and more habituated to the comparison between menof-war or gunboats and ordinary trading vessels, we may also expect that they will master the prejudice against the service of their country, which has been fostered by traditions of impresment, love of independence, aind erroneous calculation of self-interest. But there are two points which we would urge upon the Government as indispensable for the perpetual'recruiting of the navy. The first is the necessity of trainiung a succession of boys for the service, who, entering the navy at an early age, will learn to look upon it as a profession and a home. This is a matter which perhaps affects the A dmiralty less than -Poor Law Unions, Ragged and Charity Schools, and vilage authoritiet in every part of the empire. The next is, to give the ships in commuission plenty of employmentt; to make them scour the seas from ocean to ocean I and colony to colony;. to sound all harbours wand to brave all ae. )But- all these pre. paration3 will require a -irge outlay, and a .large outlay involves heavy taxation. ':Wa 'know this the( people of hEgland know- it, and it is for them to choode between parsimony *vith insignificance,- and. reputation'with e3enditure. Meanwhile let them ponder on thewp two facts :-We lately raised our naval force-gradually up to 45,000 mneu, Eolland can do more; and: France boaast of Eer ability to man her fleev' at once. with 60,000 men, and-if need be-to raise this number, by virtue of her maritine consription, to.90,00 !'
IAmong other fopics of national pride that have become ahnost points of honour-irn this country are the privacy of our private and the publicity of our public affairs. Our domestic life is within gates and doors; our political life, it may-be said, without them. If we do not sayon this latter topic a fiftieth part of. what immiediately occurs, it is that the particular occasion that suggests it is by no means the most agreeable or the most important. Nevertheles3 the publicity of capital punishment is- with us intimately associated with the noonday opennes3 of - all our public proceedings. It is the people that reigns in this country, through its ancient constituted' organs, the QUEE, Lords, and Commons; but still the people. The people is, under Heaven, the source of all power, and the author of all our policy, and the doer of all our public acts. We do not hesitate to say that it is the people that inflicts the last penalty. of the law in this country, and the pulbEcity of the process is significant of that fact. Of cowse, thero are Governments of a very unpopular ch;racter which retain public executions; 'and there are, on the other hand, pure demaocracies, such as some of the States in the Union, which shiinL- -from that publicity, and veil the awful spectacle behind the walls of a gaol, with a select body of official rwitnesses and favoured spectators. We are not concerned to explain all the anomales and unravel all the enigmas of other countries. Our only concern is with our own; and here we say that, while we boast our publicity, and cherish it as one of the bulwarks of British freedom, we have still to struggle for it. We have always to defend it against the encroachments of immense wealth, ancient privilege, and almost unbounded personal power. Hence the jelous publicity of our Parliamentary and judicial syetem. There are men in this country, and very good men in their way, who would shut the, doors of Parliament, of every court of justice, police-courti, and even vestry meetings; who would compel Exeter-hall to meet with closed doors. We have heard such men speak as if publicity were only another word for vulgarity. Were they supreme, England -would not long remain a country to live in, for, bad as may be some of the corisequences of our public system, still worse are the evils which it keeps in check. The immense variety of elements in the political and social life of England require a " fair field and no "favour" for their harmonious working, which would not be secure without publicity. The bearings of the question are large and interesting. It is not exactly our choice that just' now we start it apropos of public executions. These observations are called for by the report which we publish in another part of our imDression, and having, in our humble opinion, given the true account of public executions in this country, it is not with the profoundeet respect that we approach this very sentimental attack on the practice by the committee of the House of Lords. The report itself offers only one more instance of the way in which a case can be got up to order on any subject, and to prove any view of it. Indeed, their Lordships have rather overdone their case, through not bearing in mind the caution addressed by an old judge to a young barrister,-" Remember, young " man, that whatever you exaggerate you wea7ken." If their recommendations require this extravagance of statement, these touches of satire, this raldng together of bits from all quarters, they cannot have much real ground. Indeed, one would think these noble and right rev. Lords had been ambitious to rival the picturesque account of an execution by MIr. CHA}LRS DicEN-s. But we know people who have been to executions, and who have made it their business to see and hear for themselves. They do not describe it as an agreeable scene, or one very flattering to human nature; for, no doubt, it is not the finest mobuld or make of men or women that frequents such a spectacle; but they do not describe the scene as it is here described. They do not tell us that tho spectators exhibit an utter absence of feeling. Even if there is, as there must be in a mob of some thousands, a mixture of the lowest sort and the lowest behaviour, t-iey do not describe, as a universal or even prominent feature, "all kdnds "of levity, jeering, laughing, hooting, whistling, "while the man is coming up, while he is stil "suffering, while he is struggling and his body is "writhing, with obscene expressions, &c." These unprejudiced informants do not tell us that " the "death of the criminal is followed by shouts oE "low jesting and indecent ribaldry, the hubbub "and uproar being most disgusting." No doubt in a great multitude there will be some very bad specimens, and others so foolish as to chime in with them, but we do not believe them to be any considerable proportion of the people. Nobody shall persuade us that it is a common thing for the spectators to observe " that they would not care about " being hanged, if that is all." We don't think the case of the man who is hanging does strike 'any number of persons in the crowd as in any respect a light one, or otherwise than most miserable.- Nor do we think this statement very compatibe with the revengeful feelings- ascribed to many of the spectators, which, by the bye, considering the true idea of punishment, and the rough materials of which most people are composed, we do not consider a very extraordinary state of mind, as regards the execution of such wretches, for example, as M5r. W9ITAn. PALMR. As for the statement that the whole town, after an execution, is a scene of drunkenness, rioting, and debauchery, we have heard precisely the same arguments used against all gatherings, against country fairs, Michaelmas hirings, national holydays, the observance of Christmas-day, and even- confirmations. When country people walk into a town from a distance 'they must have refreshments, and they must go to beershops; and, if they are very thirsty and very tired, and have not a great command of their appetites, some will bo apt to: drink niore that will do them good. To pass over other exaggerations, we must say -that we- believe the behaviour of -criminals' to be very little affected by the publieity of - their - deaths, atnd to be in matter of fact generally of a very passive sort, stupid, sullen, and desperate. It is very re indeed that they enluibit bravado, protest their innocence in the hearing of the mob, sing hymns of triumph, or, otherwise assaune the ap. [pearanco of martyrs. If we are to have the mate- rialz for a right decision on this question we shall not find them in an ingenious compilation of stray bits from the evidence of witnesses themselves not unprejudiced, and therefore not impartial observers 'It so happens that, among other weaknes, the common people of this country are addicted to a belief in the escape of very great offenders. They have an immense, idea of the influence of wealth' and interest in high places. ",The gentlemen" can Co almost anything, they, think. . Dr. ])oDD. was believed to have been hung with a uilver tba in his throat, FAuNmzor was Iong said to; b alive in America, and only the other day some Irishman got ulp a caso for SADiD'S ha& ig put an end to himself by whoiy, hihi not even now without- credit. There are scores.of such stories; and they arise out of that conflict of antagonist principles to which we have alluded above. The coinmon people have a feeling that publicit# is their only guarantee. for fairness, and that it is ycasi6nally evaded. iow, it :30 happens 'that the very arrangements which,-the committee of the Lords propoe to .sup-. ply the place of sinple publicity are just of a sort to favourithe idea of imposition; Sup]p-ss a great, :scoundare, a fellow of goad family and connexion, who had-.handled hundreds.of -thousands -of pounds, and: shown great cleverness and- tact, meeting at length with his deserts on the gallows. :lere is the new process to answer the purposo of a public execution. The man is to be hangecl within the precincts of the,prison, orin some place securing similar " comparative privacy" -the people in general will not kmow exaitly where. A dertain number of official witiesses are to be present at the execution, and are to sign a deposition to having witnessed it. Why, the very act of deposing to a thing suggests that =it is questionable and requires affirmation ! Then .there are to be select spectators, such as the local authorities think fit to admit-packed witnesses, of course. Lastly, there are to be all sorts of showy pretences to produce the effect of an execution. Its exact time is to be made known to those without by the tolling of a bell, which shall cease at the moment of execution, and the hoisting at the same time of a black flag. The effort itself smaoks of deception. Fraud is marked .on the very surface of the proceeding. We -will venture to say that the common people will never believe a man to be really hanged who had friends to get him off or money to bribe his gaolers. They will lose confidence iin the perfect impartiality of the. law. At present, little as some of them love the law, they nevertheless have a sublime respect for it. Thi respect is the greatest hold we have on the masses, and vre must retain our belief that, under the peculiar circumstances of oiur countiy, it would be endangered by the sentimental process recommended in their Lordships' Report upon Capital Punishments.
"EwioeBacc7he ! is stir the cry of 7Ir. OLrvEmA. The AmAD1N of the wine movement is very faithful to the cause of her lord. Crowneed with Yine-leaves from Southern Frauce and from the sunny Rhine, on Tuesday evening the fair devotee executed the usual Bacchic movement, to the perfect satisfaction of a comparatively -full House -of Commons. If the members refused to be charmed with the witchery, and turned, half-convinoed, their coy glances from the liquid ruby which sheds so rich a lustre over the perfumed period; of- that intoxicating adjuration, the fault is rather in the times than in the men.. We, too-could we divest our minds of the prosaic thought that we are acting at a season of unsatisfied debt and under the pressure of a double Income-tax, should not be indisposed to liaten to the charmningof thetempter. We distrust1fr. OLvEma's figures, we doubt his conclusions, but we are as desirous as he can be to introduce the pleasant wines of France and Germany into use in England. AU our impulses say "Ay," while our convictions say "N No -"-we must resisttemptation. It can't be. The proposition is pleasant, but wrong. We turn from it with a grumble and a shrug, as a prudent man turns from an invitation to a dinner at Blacklwall when his finances are unequal to the strain. hlr. 0ravxrnu in this matter of the wine duties is the bon etfiant -the good fellow of the House. Ho would make us aU mellow, and inculcate upon our mninds a horror of unmoistened clay. As with regular topers, there is a kind of strange logic in his invitations to us to drink. He proves to Us that there is nothing so wholesome, nothing so economical, as drinking wine. We can, in our mind's eye, see the hon. gentleman at the conclusion of a revel converting, by the help of a few long corks, the festive board into a kind of calculating machine, and proving to his own satisfaction, and to the perfect satisfaction of a sympathizing audience, that there's nothing like drink. Alas that there shoulld be such things in the world as pumps, and Chancellors of the Exchequer, and sodawater, and little bills, and the Incometax! Stern reason bids us turn a deaf ear to the vagrant logic of this jovial disputant. Until better times, BPrr 'N.&T must content herself with a pint of beer and a cup of tea. The real fact is that, in the present financial condition of this country, it is but natural that the CQucnenor. of the ExcuEmQum should refuse to tamper with an important item of the revenue. The annual duty received upon foreign wines is about 2,000,0001. sterling. Are we in a positionto make it the subjectof anexperiment? Mr.0LmvraAs argument is, that by lowering the rate of duty the consumption of foreign wines, and consequently the revenue derived from their importation, would be increased. This is a very flattering prospect, but, we fear, as delusive as flattering. In the first place, it is obvious that if foreign wine wAre to be consumed to any great extent in this country the use of malt liquor and of spirits would pro t/ntO be displaced. At the present moment the duty on rum produces 1,253,0001.; 6n foreign spirits, 1,435,0001. The duty on hops yields 440,0001.; themualt duty, 5,418,0001.; British spirits produce to the revenue 6,864,0001. The duty upon licenses yields 1,244,0001., of which, asthe CHa-,CmoI ofthe ExcHEQuEp told us on Iondaynight, at thb least 1,000,0001. must be carried to the account of licenses for publichouses. Novw, any considerable increase in the consumption of foreign wMe would most undoubtedly affect in an unfavourable sense one or other, or perhaps all, of these items. Thus, any gain that might appear under the head of foreign -wines, if gain there -were, would be rather nominal than real. Sir I Co03zwALL LzwIs, however, on Tuesday night mainly relied upon an objection of an opposite kind. He undertook to show " that in the ease "of wine we are not to expect the ordinary "results to ensue from a reduction in the duty, "because there aro evidently other causes in "operation beyond the mere pressure of the "Customs' duties." It would be burdensome to reproduce here the figures by which the CHaceroai of the EXCEQEu1 proved his point, and we omit them with tho less. apprehension, for they may ba found at length in our Parliamentary rgport of yesterday. We will only take two terms of the series-the first and the last. In the year 1795 the duty upon French wines was 7s. 4d. the imperial gallon, and upon- Portugueie wine 3s. In the. year 1854 these beverages stood affected with an uniform rate of 5X. 9d. Now, in the year 1795 the. consumption of wines was 8,238,000 gsllons, and the revenue 1,694,0001. Tn 1854 the consumption was only 6,775,000 gallons, and the revenue 1,914,0001. The enormous increase of population ana of wealth must, of course, -be taken into account. In 1810 the dutywaslis; Sd. onFreneh 'wines, and9s. 8d. on Portuguesewines, andthe dutyprodticed2,T86,0001. With theee figures'before him, and as a mere fial. question, can 'Ir. Oarvx maintain either that a reduction of the duLty would lead to an increase in the revenue, or that a-- taste for foeign wines U- o4 the increase at all in thesae iands I t 'xsult of a comparison between the iwine operatioms of 1795 and u 854is3 ing eventothoue'whodo not ihare the vie*s of the vinouw refoirem. There certainly appears to be, in, London at lesst, a frecer use at private tables of Champagne and Bordeaux 'wines,thai existed even 20 years ago; but the cXLrmoR oE'the ExcsQuFa is there with his tables: anad his . figres, and he denies the fact. -Men, are, apt to generalize hastily and to draw theiriconclusions from too limited an area, andprobibly this is. the case iri the: present i-ntanoe. What. incxease there :s appears to result from thc larger consumption of. the strong wines of Spain, Fortugsl, and Sicily, and not from any growing taste for the more wholesom^e products of the French and German vineyards. We it consistent with ound policy, we shoulcl, have been delighted to give por. licy e our supPort in this matter. For the, moment, however, 'it sii c1darthat all considerations-' must be ,held secondary to the exigencies of the Zichequer. In 'a brief space we maust reduce the Income-tax at least to its originpral limits, for the. country will not bear the longer continuance of an impost whilah was borne with patiotic cheerfulness when We were engaged in - a Imost costly ana deadly confict with' a foreign- Power. This is the frst point on. which a. reduction must take place, for .the incidence, of . the. tax is universal. This once done, the representatives of various articles which are now suffering the pangs of over-taxation may be admitted to urge their respective cases.: One gentleman will have a good word to say for sugar, another for malt, and so forth, and the Financial Minister of the day may then }mke hi£ election 'to which of these urgent houris he will throw the kerclief.

An inquest ws opened before the deputy-coroner yesterday, and it was adjourned until the jury who have been summoned in the other cases have arrived at their decision. THE Exp;NSE OF WAX.-The budget recentlyl&id beforethe BritishParliamentby Sir George CornewallLewis, the Chancellor of theExchequer, enablesthepublie to form apretty accurateestimate of the pecuniaycoet tothe united kingdom of the late war with Russia. Accorling to the statement (whiih has been received with general approbition by all classes of the community in England, beause theyare agreeably disapDointed at the smallness of the amount), it appears that the actual cost of the wax for the two years of its duration, and the expense -hich it has occasioned within the current year, to the people of England, amounted in roundnomberato 80,00,0001., or $400,00,000. WVhat the war has cost France during the samc period has not been miade public, nor is it possible to formany accurate estimate of its amount; but if At does not considerably exceed the sum expended by England-considering the much larger number of troops she employed in the Crimea-it certainly cannot fall short of it. Neither has any statement been made of howmuchTurkey hasexpendedinfightingher own battles. nor howamuchthe Sardinian expeditionhas cost that enterprising ittle kingdom- d lt though not least, how many millions; the Czar has lavished in his obstinate thoughb disastrous defenco of his Crimean stronghold. It has been rotaghly estimated that the total sum expended by all the belligerents during the war cannot fall far short of t2,000,0O0,0000 If to this sum be added the value of pro. perty sacrificed in consequence of the war, of the fleets destroy7ed, the tow/ns burnt, the fortresses, Isarbour, bridges demolisched-all of which cost millions uponmillions in their construction-if account be taken of the property of private individuals utterly devastated inthe oourse of the struggle, and of the untold losses occasioned by the with drawaL of hundreds of thousands of men from the ordinary industrial and productive employments ofp , some idea may then be formed of the deplorable expendit of the war. But all these are insignificant in comparion with the loss of human life by the bullet, the sword, wnt5 fa,tigue and pestilence-the dread concomitants of war-even if those lives be only regarded for their material value to the rest of the world, as producers of foodl raiment, and shelter. Dring the two sbort years of the war it is estimated that upwards of three-quarters of a million perished on the field, in fight, on the wayside from cold or want, or inthe hospital, from disease, who, had they ben left to pursue their ordinary avocations, might have enriched their country and benefitted their fellow men. But apart from the material considerations of pecuniary profit or loss, considering the question as one affectig the cause and interests of humanity, who can compute the anguish, the misery, the despair which war brings in its train ? Who can estimate the blighted hopes, the desolato heartbs, the crushed fortuners and countless domestic miseries which war occasons ? They are not remembered when the triumph of the hero is celebrate d they are not noted by the chroniler; they aro not taken into account by those rho engage or provoke the contest to sat-isy ambition, lust for power, or some other fnworthy pasion sndyet they are the saddest because irremediable, couse quenoes of war-Ncse Ys-k Jousuci of Comave.

AUJSTRALIA. LIVEIPOOI TULY 16. By the arrival vhis morning of the Royal mail packet Earl of Sefton, Noble, -conmander, of the White Star line, we are in the receipt of aavicoe from Melbourne to the 25th.of ApriL She bringa 50,OOOoz. of gold on freight, and 10,000oz. in the hands of paasengers, of whom there are about:129, ana a general cargo. The screw steamship Royal Charter, from Pl-1 mouth, had arrived at Melbourne on tho- 16th of April, after an unprecedentedly quick- passage of-59 days. Her advices were 40 days antert any prm-voualy received. She was but -14 days under steani during thepassage. The greatestdistaneerunin24 hours was 352 nauticalmiles, duringwhich time she attained the astonishing speed of 18 knots perihour. The ship Anuandale, hence, arrived at Melbouiie on the 19th of ApriL There is no political news by this arrival. The price of gold had declined ' to 76s. ad. :;The receipts per escort for the week had been' 32,594 ounces, and the quantity shipped 106,273 ounese to London by the Franc;is Hentv, and- 46,769 ounces by the New Great Britain. The escortshadprovided only a smallquantity as compared with previou3 weeks, caulsed, it -was aulpposed by the rapid; fall which had taken place on the fields. At flenxigsr the price within a fortnight had fallen 2s. 9d.'per ounce, with the excha;nge on London at the. sanle rate; 2 per cent. premium. - - In wool litte had been done during the week. The adlvices per Royal Charter of the ebriaryvsales were satisfactory, an advance of 14d to 2d. being paid at the commencement, over tte prices current at the D)ecemnber salesin Lxondon.- In tallow, for colonial use, higher prices were being paid than for shipment. Within a few da a an article quite unsuited for candles had been sod at from 55L. to 561. Gold, apparently in paying quantities is reported to have been discovered near Mount hitchell, about 25 milesnorth of Armidale. The gold resembled that found at the Rockinga River, but was rougher. At Stockyard Creek, Gippsland, gold had likeise indicated itself. At Launceston a meeting had been held and resolutions passed expressive of 3Mr. Gavan Dui3j's character and career. A committee had been appointed to collect subscriptions towards the quali=cation necessary to enable him to sit in the Parlia- mentn; Our Sydney files, to the 19th of April inclusive, furnish the subjoinea reports. The Empire says:- "The general improvemeat in trade during the past 'week gives a promise of better times. Irge quantities of goods have excuanged hands at auction, and the prices obtained were much higher than recent quotations. We notice in prticular large sales of drapery goods, slos, boots and shoes, and oilmen's stores. The parcels of drapery offered for public competition have been unusually heavy and no less than four sales have taken place during the wgeei There are stillalrge parcels of goods of a similr description heldback from the market in consequence of the rasereed prices being plaedponthem by the cocsignors. Large exports of spirts have been made for the southern trade; the City of Svdney tool: -away, on Wednesday, 2,200 gallons of brandy for 'Victoria, there have also been sereral other shin. ments though of comparatively minor importance. There is little to notice in the breadstuff markset; prices remain 'without any alteration, 'with the exception of the sale ofsome Van Diemen's Land wheat, which realized lOs. 6d. per bushel Whitbread's botled porter was sold at 10s. od. per domn; loaf sugar, 5d. per lb.; washing soda, S. to 8T. lOs. per ton. At a public sale, a portion of the wools offerea was withdrawn. The lots of fleee Wools soldatl6d.; skins ranged high, sayfrom 5_d. to 6d., and these even were not of a supernor description7; good hides realized 14s. 5d. The general average price of hides forshipment ranged from 12s. to 14s. 5d.; beef tallow, good, from 43s. Gd. to 43s. 9L; mutton, 4Ss. All the above prices showr a trifling tendency lower. We have heard several complaints that there exists -agreat difficulty in getting wool and taUow down from 3loreton Bay, and that large parcels are stored there for want of conveyanoe to these markets. W. have no doubt that thisinconvenience will very soon be remedied. " A meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was held on Thursday, when the re ort on the insolvent laws was further discussed. Some progrees was made with the 32d clause, which specifies the acts that are proposed to constitute fraudulent isolvency; but it was unfinished at the ternination of a long sitting.

INDIA.. We have received our private corespondence and pars fo Calcutta to the Sd of June, and from Bomrbay to the 10th of June. Oiir Calcutta correspondent, writing on the Sd of Juno, says,- - "'An insurrection has broken out in Kiliiedy. This province is the most northerly of the districts of ladrasa wild, rough deitrict, without a road, CoTered with low hills, and inhabited by Khonds and Sowrahs. The latter tribe, -who occupy the hiul i to the eastw-ard, are now in rebellion. It a3ppear that a village chieftain, named DandaSwamee, W rVecently arested by the authorities in GanJam on a charge of dacoity. He was tried, and his zentence referred for approval to the Government of l'ifadzns. Meanrhile he escaDed, regained his-own village, and summoned his clan to arms, They apIear for some time past to have been savagely discontented with the administration of justice among them, and an old device was employed to increasa their courage. An avatar, or incarnation of the Deit, made-his appearance -among them in the lhape of a small brass image. As brazen images do not talk except to the initiated, Danda acted as nt r, and by his orders no less than 10,009) men were collected. They proceeded to attack the manager of Purla Kimedy, who efled for his life. Seven oE the police were killed on the spot, and the whole countrywas Instantly in an uproar. It is not as yet known wheSher the attack is directed against the Europeans or against the local authorities; but it seems probable that the savages have been irritated by mntive officials. No poclamations, however, have as yet been received, and these tribes are - so irritable, nuperstitious; and childlike that the existence of aubstanitial grievances is stil doubtful; -The instant the report reached Madras the Government despateohed the 31st Native Infantry to the ceene. Another regiment in Nagpore -was warned for action, md a troop of artillery despatcled from Waltair. These arrangements indicate judg,ment and vigour, but tbe country is nearly impassable, the rainsvwill set in in a fortnght, and we shall probably lose as many lives as in a mnoderately hard-fought battle. The conedition of these wd districts demands investigation. They ae reaUly less known than the interior of Africa. I auestion if a single member of Government, when the nerws reached him, understood clearly where Kimedy might be. The public certainly did not, and yet the district is as large as the majority of English counties. "Consideirable apprehension is entertained of another rising in Bengal also. Despite all the efforts of the Government-and Mr. Ialliday has really exerted himself to the utmost-large bodies of Santals continue in arms in the recesses of the jungle. They appearstrickenwith a senseless, causeless fear, which neither promises nor favours can remove. They are armed, and in the rains, when the country is impassable, will probably give much trouble., Another party of the same tribe has been ,dispered through Hazareebagh, and with the great Cole tribe of that district menaces the Government. These savages, like the rest of the tribes, are oppjessed by the money-lenders. They fancy th:at melion will pay off their scores, and are, moreover, '~ted by the injudicious lenity writhvwhich the ;antaLs have throughout been treated. A Colerebellion would be a most serious affair. They and their kindred occupy the greater part of the lonr sweep of mountainous country which separates Western 3Bengal and Orissa from the more central districts of India. Our hold on them consists solely in our prestige, and th- certainty that we shall 2Venge outrages some day. We have few troops at disposal for much work, and, if w.e had, could not niove them among swamps and canebrakes as deadly as those of Sierra Leone. The Last Cole rebellion costustwoyears of junglewarfare. The authoriiies, especially the Lieutenant-Governor, though not, ,of course,ready to acknowledge the existence of serious danger, are silently preparing to crush the firsti symptoms of an outbreak. The rains have, however, commenced already in Lower Bengal, a fortnight before they are due, and another muonth will decide the question. "The question of conferring additional security <on leaseholders is still before the Legislative Council. "I pointed in my last letter to the true causea of the delay in furnishing the ifinancal statements required by the lIouse of Commons. I have since made further inquiries into the matter in quarters srherethewhole diPaculty is understood, and the e t confis my previous view. The delay is caused solely by a determination to have the accounts right to an anna. If thev are only one anna wrong they are ' referred for explanation.' The reference =a perhaps 1,200 miles to travel, and the same distance to return, and meanwhile aU the other accounts are kept waiting. Our official year ends onthe 30th of April. The whole of the accounts can be forwarded in the rough by the mail of the 24th of My. They are, though roagh, sufficiently accurate for'all purposes; that is, in the gross revenue of 30,000,0001. there may be errors to the -extend of 3001. If, therefore, the House will but insist on having this account ending April 30 produced by September, the order can be obeyed. You may rely on the accuracy of this statement, by whomsoever questioned. "cThe speech of Mr. Vernon Smith, announcing -is resolution to cat down al salaries to the 'colonial' level, has created a great sensation. The mearest colony to India is Ceylon, and in Ceylon Incomes are not one-fourth of the Indian average; but then the civilians are allowed to own estates-a pla;n which in India wvould probably be fatal tothe continuance of our rule. Any attempt to introduce this scale would be regarded as a fraud, and resisted to the last. There is, however, no real cause for apprehending so suicidal a measure. A moderate reduction of salaries is possible, but no Governmaent in India would attempt to reduce them to the colonial leveL The public opinion of India matters little to statesmen at home, or I would warn the Board of Control against the use of the word 'colonial' in Indian afairs. It creates a feeling. of 1-edlesa irritationi fatal to any reasonable examination of new measures. The Anglo-Indians are proud of the ' empire' they have helped to build, aid the only i colonie3' with which they are acquainted are Ceylon, the Cape, and the lauritius, and for all three they entertain a most supreme contempt. Lord Canning has been unrelL. The climate of Cal7cuttadoes not appear to agree with him. It is rariy innoxious to men whio reach the country after the age of 40."' Our Bombay correspondent, writing on the 10th of June, says .- "By the latest accounts from Oude there appears to be a probability that the new settlement will not be quite comxpleted with;out bloodshed. The Rtaiah of Toolseepore, a feudatory of the late King, and a turbulent one, seems disposed to behave towards his newr master as he did towFardbis old, and refuses to pay hisrent now eahe has frequently donein theold times. A force was accordingly organized at the 3earest military station, Secrora, to proceed against this refractory chief. At fiLrt a portion only of the available troops were put in.orders, but subsequently the whole garrison was directed to hold itself in readiness to move. Two Irregouar Cavaly corps had also been ordered out from Lncknow, but the heat of the 'Weather-it was at the end of Mlay-was so intense that the order was countermanded. It would teem that the means of the Rajah mustbe iomewhat formidable, but of their nature -and extent nothinig certain was generally laiown at Secrora. He has a fofr ata placecalledKunda, five miles from Toolee- pore, against which it was supposed hlr. Wingfield, the comamioner, would direct the force; bat of the: nimberof his adherentsvaious uamoirs wero in circulation, of which one rated them as high as 10,000. But there can be no doubt that if he persists in hold- ing oat he must eventuay succumb; and it is to be hoped that he himself will 3ee this so strongly as to give in peaceably. Several minor landholders and caiefs are said to be watching bis proceedings, on whom the exampleof his timely submission to a display of our force might operate favourably-for the continnued peace of the country. - g' A letter from the same station of Secrora mentQon that Colonel Barlow, of the lato King's force, commande of bis troops in the sanguinary and victorinm skirmAih with Ameer AUl and the fanatics ast year, in which he wrasieverely wounded, has received a pubL* letter from the new Conmmias.oner of Oude, appzig him that Governinent had pased ai raolution to the- effect that he is to receive a penion e266r a-month (3201. a-year), and a gratuity of sir nionthi pay, which he is at liberty : "We h ehadno intelligence since the date of mny last letterront Afghanistan, nor do we hear of anything stirring ineNorthi-Wet Provinces or in the iPunjab. Into the latter proice X news eucationlsl scheme has been introduced, u:nder 'the suspices of the' Director of PubL& -Instruction. 'That-scheme,' says the;Fiiend fBediac- "' May be thus brieily described :-Une per cent is to be levied on the land revenue for educational purposes. This rate is to be optional where the setlemenat has been com-pleted,butineverynew settlementit isto be made compusory. As a rule, it has been cheerfully granted. As makeweight to this additional cess, Government will add a large grant from the general Teasury. Out -of this direct grant .will bo maintained the general staff of visitors, I Sector, &C., -the Central College at ahorm, and -certain schools of a higher order at the prin. cipd Tebsil stations of -districts. The one per cont. cess will be spent as it is levied'-locally. The rtepayer of UmbaUa will not be able to complain that he is paying for the education of the children of Kohat. Rich districts wiLl not be rated for poor pergunnals. All wil! have a common share in that lr supervising machiner which is supplied out- of the consolidated. fund; but the 'wealthy parts of the P'uiab, which are dlso generaly the ispouous, will not be losers by their superior wealth. Their salperfintes viill not S°go tc make, up the deficiencies of others. The poorest districts may well be expected to yield the cess; but the richest will not givemore than is required for their owvn educatk nal organization."' "Sir John Lawrence, Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, vwill, it is'stated, visit Gholab Singh in Cashmere during the ensuing cold season, probablv inthe month of Otober, when Sir John leaves Murree for 'Lahore. This wiil be the first meeting of thu English Conimissioner and the Maharajah within the doninions of the latter - and the story goes that Gholab will be on his best behaviour, and vill attempt to make everything look as bright as possible before the eyes of his distin"uished visitor. A special corps is to be despatched"to wait upon and escort the Commissioner, and to keep the roads in the vicinity of his camp clear of the rob. bers with which they are infested; or, rather perhaps, as popular-belief maintains, while showing all due civility to Sir John, so to isolate him from the natives of thaI country through which he is7 travelling as to insure his receiving no petitions' or representations of which the contents might lead him to doubt the absolute tranquillity of the kingdoni and the perfect happines of the subject3. " Among some papers that have lately been nublished relative to the annexation of Nagpo'e there appears, with many that may be read with interest, one which seems to bear especial marks of the pen of our late Imperial Viceroy. After it had been determined by the Supreme Goveranent to annex the country, thethenCommlssionez; thoughinformed officially of that determnination, laid before tho Council an elaborate proposition for the erecion of a titular principality in Berar, the Rajah. to have an hereditary title, an hereditary estate, and an hereditary income to the extent of one-sixth of the revenues of Nagpore. The receipt of this proposal Lord Dalhousie acknowledges with surprise and dissatisfaction. The principle it embodies wasfully considered by the Council before they came to their resolution. While the subiect was under discussion the Council would gladly have heard the opinion of the Commissioner, which it would have been as properin him then as it was improper now to put forward. 'When,' says Lord Dalhiousie- "t ' The Government of India had, in the exercise of its conscientious judgment, pronounced its formal decision upon the principle by which it considered that. its conduct ought to be governed in the case of the principity of Nag. pore; and when it had officially inforned the Resident that it had resolved that that principality should become a cortion of the British territories in India, all my colleagueg wil concur with me, I think, in feeling that the Commis. Eioner ought not in his reply to have straightway proposed that a principality should be reived in Nagpore. my col. leagues, I think, will share my surprise that in full personal Inovwledge ofthe sentiments of the Supreme Government the Commissioner should nowv advocate a policy diametricaly opposed to its declazed views; and they il partake in the dissatisfaction with which I zegard the adoption by this officer of a course which, perfectly wel surmised as it will be by the Bhor,lah family, will unques. tionably persuade them that the daclareddecsionofthe Government of India regarding the princpality of Nagpore is not a final one, and .rill keep alive hopes in their minds the ultimate disappointment of whichca only serve to azgravate the mortihcation which they have already sufferel In theformer discussion Istatedful theresons bwhichI was led to object to the creation of a nevr rjah as the ruling sovereign of Nagpore I object now for different reasons, but not less strongly, to the creation of a mere titular raisah and to the perpetual alienation in his favour of one-ixth of the revenues of Nagpore-a measure which is proposed by the Commissioner on the poor ground that the 'Indian nation looks up to a monarchical and aristocratical form of life.'

Reviews are now of freqnent occurrence, but ia reviews, as in all othersublmary things, there re degrees of splendour, and assuredly that.which took place yesterday at Aldershott was, both in interest and as a militaFY spectacle, inferior to none that we have witnessed since the declaration of peace. There had been a'thunderstorn anld torrents of rain th9 nght preceding, and the morning, gloomy and tempestuous, seemed to theaten what Isgo calls "a suitable sequestration ;" but as the day wore on the squadions of clouds that scudded rapidly-over the watery sky gradually disappeared, the sun shone forth, brilliantly, and, though thete were slight showers anid some brisk breezes towards evening, tne weather was on the whole as favouable as we have a right to expect at Midsummer in these. north-westemn latitudes. Of the-membera of both Houses about 140 attended. Amoing the visitors we observed the Duke of Buccleuch, t-he Duke of Leeds, the Duke of Newcastle, Earl Powis, the Earl of Pomfret, the Earl of Long. ford, tho Earl of Dalkeith, M.P., * Viscount Palmerston, Viscount Duncan, h.LP., Iord Dynevor, Viscount Dungarvan, Lord Overstone, Lord Campbell, Lord Ravensworth, Lord Sidney, Sir Gl.

' The members' train left the Royal station at Nine Elms at a-quarter past 12, andarrivedat Fainborough about 2. On alighting from the carriages the members took their places in ten metropolitan omnibuses, in which rather undignified vehicle3 they were conveyed to the camp under an escort of the 7thHussars. "TheLandTransportoperations," as the Premier designated them the other evening in the House of Comrmons, having been concluded, it was amusing to observe with what rapidity and eagerness the representatives turned their attention to the' Commissariat. "Where are we to lunch?" was the first question that fell from the lips of the famished Senamtor us soon as they found themselves within the lines of the encampmenit. Fortunately, they had not to travel far through that bleak desert 'without manna, forsoontheireyeszwere gladdenedbythe sight of a tent, where aU manner of good things were provided under the charge of 'the Messrs. Staples. At 3 o'clock the trumpets and bugles sounded tihe "assembly." The troops were soon under arms, and, with their ban5s playing before them were seen wending their way melodiously to the review g'rou bothe grund. Tlhe Germnan and Englis troops, both horse and foot, which had been eitherpreviously inspected by Her Majesty, or which had not served in the Crimea, formed in contiguous columns on the crest of the hill which rises to the west of the: old Roman entrenchment known as Ciear's Camp. The Artillery was on the right, and .{he German Cavalry on the left. The CrimeanRegiments were.drawn up in three double lines across the Long Valley, the cavalry forming the first line; the Royal Sappers and Miners, the 34th, 41st, and 49th Regiments, the second line; and the 93d Highlanders, which had only landed on the previous day, and the second battalion Of the. ifle Brigade, the third. 'It was, we preslue upon the well-known poetiC principle- "'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view`- that a vast proportion of the visitors, and more especiallysucl of them as hadnottheadvantageof being mounted, were banihed as far as possible from, the' ground, and-were obliged to take up their positions in remote localities, where, without observin the particulars of the scene, they could only rece-ve a general impression that there were in the fiela gream masses of armed men. The Queen and the Royal party arrived on the ground at 20 minutes after 4 o'clock. 3Her Majesty, who was escorted by a detachment of the 7th Hussars, was seated in an open carriage, in company wivth the Princess of Prussia, the Princess Louise of Prussia, and the Princess Royal. The Royal suite consisted of the Countess of Desart, Baron d'Alvenaleben, Major-General the Ron, Charles Grey, Colonel F. H. Seymour, and LieutenatColonel de Boyen. By the side of the Queen's carriage rode, on horseback, Prince Albert, the Prince of WVales, Prince Alfred, and the 3?zince of Prussia, and then followed a glittering retinue, including, among others, Lord Pamnure, General Lord Rokeby, Lord A. Paget, MIajor-General RPose, Sir R. Airey, General Grey, Colonel Douglas, Cololnel Macdonald, and Colonel Hood. The Royal party rode at a leisurely pace down the front of the line while the bands played the national anthem and the colo-rs were drooped. The inspection concluded, they returned to the base of the hill, where also were assembled the Lords and Commons, the Ministers of State, and a brilliant group of equestrians. The cavalry forming into columns of troops, and the infantry into columns of companies, then took ground to tho right, and in that order marched past the Queen. The RoYals and Scots Greys, only a few of whom were mounted took the lead, and were followed by the 6th Ennislidlen Dragoons, some parties of dismounted Crimean Dragoons from various regiments, and, finaUy, by the representatives of the gallant 11th Hussars, some 25 officers and men, "sfew and faint, but fearless stiLl." The line of the infantry was preceded by the boys from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the Sappers and Miners followed, and the Rifles brought up the rear. The 93d EEghlanders, which were so much admired at Chobham, and which, having- happily suffered very little during the Crimean campaign, are ahmos all veterans, marched with a strength and steadiness wonderful to behold. No doubt the costome adds to the -effect, but a more splendid body of men has seldom been seen. None but the Crimean troops marcedpast, and it was inpossible, therefore, to institute any comparison with the Guards, but we axe inclined to tbink that both in height and breadth the 93d are superior to the battalions on the ground yesterday, whicl, ad. nmrable as they are, contain many young soldiers the represe-atativesof those 'who perisihed at the Alma or Inkermann, in the bloody conflicts of the trenches, or of yet more fatal disease. The Rifles, on whom perhaps more than any one corps the hard work of *he siege devolved, were in fine condition. Almost every man 'wore the Crimean medal with three or more clasDs. Several wore the Caffre medal also, and some thie Sardinian decoration. it was strange to see how much. in all sunand exposure haa told upon their countenance. M1any were burnt to a degree of awartbinesu maet alunu iu natives of our cimate, and, though in high health, the worn features and eager glance told almost as expressively of - hard and recent service as the shaggy beards and faded appointments. Though many were very young, all had a look of age, so son does war and its cares tell upon the frame. Moet of the mounted officers Tode Arabs or horses of the country, and every regiment was attended by one or more Russian dogs. After passing in the manner already. deseribed the troops deployed, and, having formed into three double lines, facing the 'west, advanced in adminble order to the air of "British Grenadieras" On arriving witbhin a few paces of the illustrious party they halted. The Queen then descended from her caniage, and leaning on the aM of Princo Albert walked down the line acompa nied by her Royal guests. Her Majeit conversed affably with the commanding offiers, and honoured with her particular notice such of the men as were indicated to her as having taken part in the whole Rusin campaign. By a happy coincidence the sun shone forth at this momaent-with, unwonted splendour, and the scene was delightfully brlliant. and animated. The contrast of co&aumies, especially betweeon the sombre Rifdea and the ilighlanders, with their picturesque uniforms and their colours tatered like the robe of Julius Cme=ar, 'was very xtriking, and The chnging effects of thre sunbeams as thaeygned and gltered over }sakos anzd helmets, abzes and bay'onets, were continually altering and improving t{he general aspect of the field. The soldierly appearance of tlse. mn, the brightness of their equi4xeats5 and the steaineea and aocuracy of their movements, -wre subjects of univeral encomium . Ater .this inspecton the maiontvres. cornenced, and until past 7 o'clock there was a rapid succession of attacks, retreats, skdrmihing, and lharwges of cavalry, in lwhich the Gerznniis,. both infantry and cavalry, especiall 'disting'nishd thomselves.

"On the fisrt 4zxof these heads of inquiry it' is,'fromthb nature of the se, impossible to arrive ast auytngt sor certain than opinion; the committee have there'fere,eidea, voured to obtun, the -9piniOn off, those who, fro mtheir official position, possessed peculiar opportunities of dra' their conclusions from actial observation of the idng of the present systein, an have sifted the grounds on whica these opinions have been formed. "On the first head of qnuiry.4he effect, that is t'o sy, + ihe sight of capit-l punisaments,oi the mass of the spectators-«te great preponderancelof evidence mepresaiufs the sight of capital executions as by no means gcner'Uy aletel - ring in its effect - th'at it i. regarded as a mere .sight to which people thiiong trom all parta (Answers 191, 192,-194 194). Thst, in the words of the witnesses, it is regarded ' as a ehow' (Letter 3); and' that all kinds of levity, jeerings laughing, hooting, whistling, while tha man is comingip i while he is still suffersig-while he is strugglibg and his bodyis-writhing aregoing on, /with obscene express!ons? (zN) ;that 'tho6ightclearly diminishes the :wfutliess of the effects of capital punishment' (235. 333); thatthere;,was no evidence of any -moral impressiori (45)'; that tlie death of the criminal is followed by 'sounds of low jesting. and indecent ribaldry' (85), 'the hubbab and uproar being most disgustDig' (L-tter 2). That in conversation afterwv0ads the spectatcrs ' mado light of it' (103), with such remarli6 asJ 'I should-not care about being hanged if that is allY (i05); that it was xiot to them ' a terrible sight' (322) that, .when viewed more seriously, it was too often from the gratificat tion of merely 'revengefulfeelings' (110; 333); that its tendency is 'to harden those "who see it' (113 ; 232) who ' go to. it as they would to a theatre or t-he exhi' lition of ai bull-fight, pretty' nearly the same 'faces 'being observed -near the scaffold. on eachoccasion' (268) -On the other hand, one witness who has had opportunities of observation 'hought 'that the present mode 'had. a very decidedlybeneficialeffect`"(35); thatit 'tendedtopreveatn -*the commission of crime' (353;' 372); and that even those - who laugaed'and joked at the time might afterwards be affected by it; but the adaed, that he knew no instanCe or this, while the notion of the honour of criminals 'dying game' (378) was ' i-ery common aniong the lower class of society' (367); and that, 'speaking indhidually, he Was' decidedly of opinion that it 'ould be much better that executions should take pla6e privately, the present mode satisfying a morbid 'curiosity which ought not to be, . gratified' (363-365). "12. On the second point-of the' moral effect upon the towns where executions take place it was setedin evidencethat 'the whole town for the day was a scene of riot ind drunkenness and debauchery of every kind ' (677); thatthe roads approachingit were, towards evening, 'filled with aisorderlyand drunken persons' (19); that the country people 'flockinas toa bull-baiting or a cockfight,' and, after the -solemn scene is over, 'the day is invariably one of drank-enness, oaths,' and disorder' (19); that the 'day isa kind of holyday spent at the beershops' (213). 'The disgraceful state of the town,' says a witness of the highest character, 'onthe, day' of execution exceeded anything that Ihad before witnessed, or could 'ave credited' (Appendix 8). "3. On the third point-of the effect produced on the - criminal portion of the population-the evidence vas, that ihe present mode tended to glorify the crinminal, and' so 5nvest criine with something like the honours of martyrdom (19); that criminals were commonly found to have beea 'frequent attendants at executions (47; 4985; 219); that the terrors of death were lightened by the spectacle (142; 170; 372; 173;* 2-39), and " a hrdening effect produced on those wivho were already tainted with crime' (290; 339); 'that the - iag,ination of an evil-doer would draw a far more impres sive picture of an executiontakdng place within the gaol, out Ef his si&ht, than would be actnally presented to his eyes' in public' (333); and that " no good effect could be traced in criminals to their having witnessed executions" (380); bht that, 'if criminals were executed within the prison walls. and seen no more after trial and sentence, it would strike 'terror and dismay into the wicked' (Appendix ). " 4. On the criminal himself the effect was described as' leading 'to bravado, protestations of innocence, singing hymns' of triumph (331); and as 'having altogether an injuriousinfluence' (332). "'5. Asto the eiils which might be apprehended from any change of system, one of the witnesses gave his " de. -cided opinion that the public execution of criminals deters from crimes' (372). He vas] also convinced, that ' no plan for private executions would satisfy the publiogenerally (359). He thought that doubts and suspicions might pre-vail in the public mind whether the execution had really 'taken place' (364); and 'that the middle and lower- classes 'wbuld wholly disbelieve in the fact of such executions' (373; 390). Another witness tho'ught' that such suspicions znight exist'when'sefitnce had been pronounced against a' eman of the higher classes, unless some chosen panel of witnesses testified as to the fact) (98); while two others wrote, - that the public is certainly in favour of public executions' (Appendix 7). On the other hand, one witness, eminently qualified to form a correct judgment, writes, 'I have no hesititioninrconfidentlystating that, in' my opinion, 'no 'benefit, directly orindirectlyris derived from public executions' (Appendix 8). "'6. Onthe advantages which might be looked for from 'such a change, many of the witnesses gave their opinions. They urged the 'great advantage of the removal of those evils which have been already enusraerated as accruing to the spectators of such scenes generally, to the criminal portion of the community, to the criminals themselves, and to tiettownsinwlwichpublicexecutions are now carried-into -effect; and they added- the expression of their conviction 'that a certain mystery and uncertainty 'about the' actual extinctiora of life creates greater solemnity upon the miind than the public witnessing of the act'(109); that, 'if it were known to these who might- be congregated about by the tolling of a bell, or some external signals, such as raising a ibhlac f&a-g, that at that moment the muan was dying, they 'would mlore reffect on' what 'was going forward, and' it w9uld be attended with a be.ter and more awful effect' (175; 241; 242; 333; 339 (Appendix 2). Siceh was stated by one witness to7be ' the general opinion of the police-officers employed under him' (305; '306 ; 307); and on' this prin-' eiple; in another -district the prisoners were not allowed, to seO the execution qf'capital offenders (184 i185 ;186) ; while the witnesses 'did not see the slightest dificut-in ~crryLnsg'into effec6 'execuions-in ~c6mparatiVe~ I'priacy so as to remove all ' danger of the aeprehension that they' had not beenesirried into effect,both bythe ellasses whio constittitl -the lookers-on and the community at large' (183).

As to the customs 'f other countries with regard to executions, and the effects which have resulted from them' 'the committee received evidence tnat in Prussia, and in aevesiof the northern Gennan Sitates, executions have for the last tenlor tweve years boeen a ways carrid into effectwithin the pnson wahls (392); thati many of thte ;teas -of'North America the practice of carrying into effect exe-- utionrithin 'ai gaol wll before'some few admittel- tatbrs '7i"adpted ten-or twelve yesr's 'sgo ~(420) Thie' eOxtoutosiO 'l;o, in :the 'oolouy of 'Bai t ish.

. ME1mo-r2L To THE FpEoCaE An. y.-The followiDg are the terms of 'the proposition presented to the SeAate by Baron C. Dlupin and 15 other members of the body,'for the erection of a monument in honour of 'the Emperor :YObolcoiL IIm. and the army .-" There are certain grind circumstances in which the national feeling burst-fo*rh, .and,-.when it becomes necessary to give a consftttional bx* pression. to it,;to the Senate belongsi tho right of bringflng for*rard pr-oposition3 on ;;tters oE great public interest.- If ini the eym Of France-now vmore chivalrous and generois than ever-there is a public interest of the first order, it is that of her glory-it is the expression of national gratitdde for the victories which raise her so high amaong nations andhonourher msog the human race. It has appeared to us desirable that in the form of the nropositiore authorizedl by the constitution, the wish 'of the Senate should be e .pressed for the ereetion of' a national monuient, to he ratified by a law. -'This monument would, at the samen time, express- the' ad3n'iration and the gratitude of the Senate and of the country for the glorious evebta which have just been terminited by a peace not less inmortal than the victories of which it is the closing triumph. France had pledged herself on her sword notto make any conquest for herself; all she undertook was for the freedom of the seas and to extend the rig1ts of humanit3y. After the campaign of Austerlitz,. which was also followed by a peace which raised to the, highest point the grandeur of the empire, it was resolved to erect a column in imitation of. those which in the Eternial City immortalized the 'reuiembrance of the victorioas and pacificating Antonines; it is this monument which sta?ds 2n the Place Vendiine, between 'the Bne de Rivoli and the Rue de la Paix. Ought not a monument of the same kind to be nov erected, in the name of France, in memory of thevictories of the new grand army and of the genius of the new Napoleon? Such would be our second Trajan's Coluns. For this monument of at! the same time triumph and paification an admirable site would do honour to the wish 'of the Senate and to the gallant deeds of our arnmy. By one of those wonderful creations .which give to Paris regularitv, grandeur, and light where previously everything was oascureand unhealthy, the Boulevard de'Sebastopo--from the StrasburgRailway to the Barriere d'Enfer-that mnonumental road-reaches its culminating point between,the churchof St. Genevieve and-the palace of the Senate. At that spot it crosses the new Via Sacra, which leads from the temple 'of the laws to the temple of God-to St. Geneviave, which for Paris signifies the northern conquerors retreating east'wards. At the point where the two monumental roads of war 'and of peace meet might be raised with perfect prbpiiety the trinimphal columu, the erection of which it, is our wish to realizs. It would command the left banL- of the Seine as -the Arc do Triomphe de rEtoile commands the right bank. The traveller arriving would, from ] a distance, perceive at the same time the two, monuments which would call to mind the grandeur and the glorv of two generations and of two empires. On 'thepedestaI of the most modern should we not see with pleasure figure on the north side, vhich looks towards theright bhnk of the Seine, ,the advanced guard of the army of the East, on its returh from Sebastopal, filing off on that bank before the Empercr amidst the acclamations of a whole people? On the side which looks towards St. Geneviave and Italy vould it£i6t le pleasing to see figure the French army at. the foot of th'e Capitol,doin; honour to its standards by saluting His Holi-! ness PiusI-X;., reflaced in' the chnir of St. Peter by the victory of France? On the south it would be *ished to see represented the glorious contingent of the 'army of Africa--of -that army departing for the East, where four of its generals went to achieve by 20 months of comhats and four great victories a right to the bAton 'of maTshal, obtained by Cond6 and Turenne in the 17th century, and by Massena and Soult in the l9ih. On'the:side towards the Senate a very simple inscription-which is best suited to grand things-might only contain these words 7- ' ANapol6on IIL, a la nonvelle grande armee -oeu du S6inat et de la.France; Mai, 1856.' Lastly, on the spiral coating ivhich would cover the column, sculpture, with its bassirehevi, would reproduce the numerous and varied exploits ofthe French in the East, the North, ana the South-in Asia, in Europe, and in Africa. Three seas triumphiantly occupied; landings effected, wonderful for their iorderiand grandeur;.-assaults of army against army; the French eagles planted on the wals of Sebastopol, Boniarsund, Kertch, and Kinburn guns from our vessels -landed 'and served by our bailors ; oth-ei guns on board demolishing the granite fortresses from the.seas of Finland and of Bothni& to the mouths of the Borysthenes; as a prelude to these great feats, the Sahara conquered in the depth of its deserts, and the' two' sabylis 'pened' to civilization by victory --those are sub,jects worthy of inspiring the genius of our most illustrious artists. The statue of the Emperor would naturally-have its place on the top of the column." This proposition being refefred to'a committee of the Senate was m'ost'favoniiably received, and after fnU 'deliberatioi the Senate decided to send in the foUowing report to the ;mperor on the sibiect: '-" Sire.-An admirable series of campaigns a2d of raiXitArytriuinplis hai been completedtis thne victory'.o! trtities Eo' disinterested on your psrt,- ss fUvourable to the bJance of jpower of nations; to the- senrity and to the freedom of the seas, and to the interests of the'hmniisa riace The glorious -a'd revered position whic France has thus acquired under the ausDices and by-the gIovetnment of your 'Majisty inspires tlhe -Senate, -a& i' does all, good citizens, -with -'the desire of presierving the remembrance of it by a monumental column.- The promoters._ of the pro'ect 'have described in the text of their proposition the' triiuphal column -which they wish -to hane erected, and also its site at the s'iimit of the road, also trinumphal, which is 'being dpened-by ybur orders to glorify the feats of Sebastonote The report of the committee charged to examine this pro-- position has shown, by the glorious souzevirs of the firt 'empire, the powerful influence of a monument of this kind -dn the country and on the 'army.

It appeed 'that she continued .to' get worse, Ana on the 8thofMay,the daywhenthedecharations -made by the-plaintirf thst his -wife. waS in 'good- halth, the -condition-she- sw in was sio urgent thatbDoth. the medical gentlemen adviseidthatDr.Jeafreson, the eminentphysician to St. 03aitholouleWvs Hospital, shouldbe called in, and that gerntleman treatedte case as being one of the last extrernity, and 'oi fthe llth-- the- ladr died, the ciuse-of death being the disease called pericardlitis, or inflammition of the mnembrane covering the heart, and which appared to have neen the result of thpse'vere cold sio had taken. The above fscts'were all madLe mnt by the evidence adduced in behalf of thedefendants, and it was showFn that the plaintiff was constantly in. the house durIng his 'wife's: illness, and- that ie.was aware that Dr. Je ffreson had been called in toconseit 'ith the other miedical gentlemen in conseqiuence of the dangerous conditionhiswif&wasin. It was elicited in the ourse of' -the cr6ss-exanination that the company had e,h'aged a 'pirini of 3 per cent. upon the policy, which was the'oudinary premium for a life l(. years older than that of the7deceased, and i s aid that this adlitional premium was charged on aesountof themedical officer hbving stated that she was of dYehicate appearace. Mr. LAXTOI iddresed the jury on the part of the plain. tiF, anid he endeavoured to shol.thathe had not made any wilfully false-dedlarition with ogard othe condition of his wife. ]e'nrged that their 'was nothing whatever to justify the jiryiin coming to the conclusion that he was aware she ass in' as dgerous conditi6n, and all he kne v'was that she bad a cold, frnm'whichhe probibly thought she would very soon recover, and that he was perfectly justified in maldng the declaration - he had done. He 'then observed upon the company hivi'g charged S3 much additional premium, and said there could be no doubt that they treated the life as a speclaitive one andcthat they were not jstified in tumrning round upon-the plaint&ffandiefusing to pay the po'icy. A great sekn viluesess-were called on behalf of the plaintiff, but their evidence really differed very little in all the naterisI facts from that' given on behalf of the company. The chief point that appeared to be relied on WAs the fact that the plaintiff did not at'any<period of his wife's illness {appeai to consider that she -was-in a dangerous state, ind that she was merely considered to be suffering from a severe cold. .Mr. JASn having' usade a most - able reply -upon Ithe 1vhole case, -p I r. ,l'nrstice ERLIf summed up, and, having called the attention of theijury-to the- nature of the action, he said ;thztnothing .couIdhe,-of. noreimportance .to the public ithan that contracts of this description between insura-rce companies and. persons-who effected insurances should- h.e carrsed'out'-honastly, and in good faith, and juries therefore .oughttto be careful to diecowge inyattemut at fraud, It 'was 'nmfortunxtcly:-to '*ellbsown -'tha. insurance compa'nies had 'been defrauded.to a: vast extent -by -per- Xsons -'who~ -' -elfetd - fraudulent- insurances,- and, circunistance .th-tT'ha-i 'xcently been maide public were qi coi=a3tionotfthis act.

W1STER-NT CTROm W WCBIE STER, JuLY 16. LNISt ERIUS UOURT._Befort Mr. Baron MARlTnr and a - SU".? A5ND A,O V. aXAeAUVLEY. . - Mr. Serjeant Kinglakes and M[r. Bullar were counsel for the plaintiffs; Sir F. Thesiger (specially retained), Mr.M. Smith, and Mr. Xsrslake for the defendLnt. This was -an isse, directed by the aster of the E olls,to try the validity of tie will of George Macauley; who for-merly resided at Purwell in the parish of Christchurch. Mr. Serje3nt KLN-GL&Kea, in opening the case, said,-tlhe -p]aintiffs were trustees and executors under the will-f George Macauley. The defendant was the brother and hiirat-law of George maldey, who had lived for 30 year at Christchurch, and, died on the 23d of NTovember, 1854, atthe we of 63, possessed of property both at Christchurch and toe Isle of Wight. His will ws-dated the 14th of NoveM ber, 1854, and he bad dssposed of Wis property to the exclda sion of his relatives. 'Upon the will 'being msde kniown it became the subject of -dispute on the part of his sistei BeatLX=Lacnley, auiditinately proceedings were adopted in the Court of Chancery, -which had led-to this issue, sz order that the validity of' that will might be detenriued&. The assertion oa'the other side was, that George Macauley had beeji of incompetent mind to mJk-e a will ever since h:i' infancy. His sister Beata hd always been hostile to him, and in 1845 she had sent doctors and otbei parties to visit, him, with the view of inq~arz into his state of mind; but al those parties were so well tisfied, that no proeeedings were adopted, He w" afflicted with paral_sis to such a deg,ree thit -for years he had not left his house. Vhen he~first went to Christchureb. he had' a housekeeper named lMay ough She bad two daughters, Jane and Mary. The latter married Charles Jeffery, and' Jane lived with her mother isa Macauley's house. -aryJ'effery died, and Jane aferwArda married the husband of her deceased sister Mary, and the offspring of that marriage were two children, Jane and Mary Ann, and the will was made in favour of Jane and her' two daughters; and it was hardly to be -wondered at whhea they had been the only parties vho' had been knd to him, who had sdministered to all his wnts; and who were daily endeavouring topalliatei his unfortunmat. estuation. In. the year 1850 Macauley gave ths writtes instructions to his solicltor, Mr. Richard Sharpe, to prepue his will, and he thereby gave a his ne e al ispopdy to bedivided between the Gough family. His Dnglish bools were to re gived to Mary Ann Jefferyv, and his lAtin books he gave to AEr. ShLpe. Shortlj aftjrwards he gave additional instructions, 'whereby "Ihe gave to his sister Beata.10&.andno more, because she has alwv4y treated me with the greatest' disrespect from my earlfiest Jars, ind beusse she rmade an. attempt±o have me drged-frommyhouse and plaed in a lunatic asylum." A lQng correspondence took place between: Macaulayandotherparties; in December, 1850,8 w rote, to hi-:attorney, 'stating that ha wished 'to have some' money on mortgage,; and he closed that letir bv saying"VrhaVvesee letters to write, but I mnst defer the job until I can get a good pen." In anotherletterhesd,.: "Cur'e. the pen!" He (the Serjeant) was told that' one of 'the acts of insanity to be- relied izpen was' .that he; was always quarrelling with his pen. The deceased vas not the only persoil who complained of his pen; for he hi lf fr'equently took up half-a-dozen bafore he could get one that wouldwrite ait all; but ifhe" squ&rreiiud with hispen the laDguage of the letters was that of a most 'intelligent-man. - The iearned coUsel then-pro. - duced a mass of letters (some hundreds), and called upon the jury to infer from those that tho deceased was perfectly competent to make *a wilL He also adverted to other es-i deuce which he should produce, and then he believedtlba t the casa for the plaintiffs vas unanswerable. , i The letters read certainly did not e:lnibit any ayuaptoms of w-ant of mind, and they -were answered by Mr. Share - who evidently seemed to believe that he was dealing with.ai sane man in some of the letters the deoeased expregsed a'suspicion that his sister Beata woul endeavour to take o'ut a commission de lur,a!ico inquirendo, as regarded hini. -Mr - Sharpe answered it by expressing an opinion that such am, attempt was not unlikely, hut that it could not succeed, aud. he recommended a carcat to be entered, and that the de& ceased directed him to have done.

A person namedJohlnsoa (awoman), ifterwards came into the house, and, in reply to inquiries,, made by.Mr Johnson, the prisoner, who had been obliged to g to bed, coinfessed tbat she had been delivered, of a child in the privy, but sho aEserted that *it was stillbor. , On exmninig the Eoilof the privy the dead body of a new-born - child was found, with its mouth downwards in the soil and partially covered over.

At this time tle child w3s in perfect health- and had rosy cheels.

- QYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY, - tv.rT Arnr ? t --, -- : a - CHFLMSPORD, JUL~Y 16. hegreat centre of attraction to-day, at the meetlng here cf the Royal Agricultural Society of Englanlf, hlas been thc cattlyard, to which, about 2 o'c2ocek,ater the judges .had awosrded the various prize; the public were admitted for the first. ime on tle pa~m~ut of is. each. To this part of the ebihiltionnaiderable. interest invariablybelongs, for it' is vone in which not only the great stock bree&ers end bi3fa farmers, but also the uninitiated part of the community find rational 'enjoyment and materials for admiration, though they look at .it from different points- of of -view. Besides its- usual attractions, which on this occasion are in many respects more than ordinaiily great, one little.circumstance connected with it is ;3t once a novelty in itself, and, what is of more prcmnise and significances a new exemplification of the international hopes and aspirations fonnuded on the Anglo-French alliance. For tfie it time since the society was embodied has it soughttoenlist the-competition of agriculturists of foreign countries. Pri;es have this year been offered for stock of any pulrely foreign race, and the result is that several dish-nguiihed agricuiturista in various parts of France have responded to the invitation; a few of -th-e finest -specimens -of- their native breeds of cattle, some of them of singular beauty, are now being exhibited here, and theyhave waged a spirited competition among themselves for the honorary rewards. Agents from the French Government are also in attendance at the meeting for the purpose of purchasing specimens of the finest of our horses, cattle, and sheep, with the -view of introducing the breea into that country. The number of people -who have visited the Exhibition during the day has been very great. The neighbouring gentry and'their families for miles round .ave ilocked into- the -town throughout the morming, and special trains on the Eastern Counties Rsilway have brought down a considerable number of visithrs from the metropolis,' thoug&h occasional showers of rain have to some little extent marred the general enjoyment. Among the noblemen and genvenmen mi the- showyarcl during the day, in addition to those who visited it on-the preceding day, and who were again present, were,-the Duke of Richmond; the Earl of Chichester, Lord Dacre Lord Rivers, Lord 13ateman, Lord Lilford, Lord Rayleigh, Mr. Eayter, M.P., 2Mr. Colville, 1M.P., MIr. Lapgston, M.P., MIr. RaiLkes Currie, M.P., Mr. Wadaingdon, MLP., Mlr. Cobbold, MAP., Mr. Bruce, BL Borier, and M. St. Marie, the ConsulGeneral of Switzerland. AL Eugene Gareau, the :Erench juror,; M. de Villers de Pit6, commissioned from the'Netherlaiids4 and 31. de-Giugius d'Eclaspens, the Swiss juror, were again in attendance, andawarded the prizes forforeiga stock among the several competitors. Unquestionably the chief feature in the implement department of this year's exhibition is the attempted cultivation of the land by steam- power. Mir. Fo-ler has applied his apparatus of fixed engine andiwire-rope to the traction of cultivators, ploughs, &c.'; while Boydell harnesses his locomotive directly to its tas-. In both cases, notwithstanding the extremely unfavourable state of the land, remarkable success was attained. Boydell's engine pulled BicTdell's scarifier with its teeth eight inches in the land at its ordinary walking pace without much difficulty, and four ploughs drawn by it in a subsequent trial turned four feet width of that heavy soil with ease. Fowler's frame of ploughs, with its four mould boards, clid excellent work in the light lind trial ground. The engine, stationary in one corner of the field, worked. these ploughs at a distance of some hundreds of yards-a standing crop of corn in some places intervening; the wire rope in this case quietly conveying the po1wer from its soifrce to the point where it was required, without disturbance to the operations going on between the tvo. The award of the Society'spri7e for successin steak culture has not yet however been made, the colndition requiring that the method employed shall prove -economical as compared with present experierce. The success of this reaping machine has been completie, but the award of the juidge has not -yet been made. - A further trial is to be made on Afr. Fisher Hobbs' farm, near Colchester, during harvest time. BellPs reaper as improved by Crosskill, iy'Cormick's, =,niade by Burgess and Key; and Eussey's, mnanSi4esltD y b.-ny, pr-qent almost equal cl-Lims O7n tho :attention of the frer, so far, at least, as the quaiity of their performance is concerned. The rat appeared to lay the swathe it cuts more eveiily, but this superiority is attended with a greater cost in the implement itself. *ALn immense variety of clod-crushers and rollers is exhibited. A nnmber of discs strung on a common axle and having independent motion on that axle, is the - feature common to all. They vary in the form of edge which the disc eshibits, and clods have thus the alternative presented them of being crushed, or squeezed, or pierced, or ground, or torn asunder; the result, however, being to leave comparative little behind the implement, which has little but lumps andelodsbefore it. In ploughs,harrows,horse-hoes, and the ordinary tillage implements to wlich the attentionof thesociety's judges hasbeen this year almost exclusively confined, we notice but little alteration. Among machines for sowing corn and manfre we may refer to some ingenious con- trivances by Mr. Chambers, of Fakenham. The I practice of applying water along with seed. and manure, introduced by M1r.Cha;ndler, of Aldbourne, is here improved by collecting aUl the wrater so applied on to the successive points in the row when the seed is deposited; in fact, dropping water, seed, and manunre together at intervals of 10 or 12 inches as the machine proceeds. The seed so sown comes. up in bunches, which are thinned to single plants. In 6rdinaiy drilling they come up in continuous rows, anafor singling, or rather bunching out, the plants at intei-vals of 12 inches or thereabouts AIr. flucklna has provided an ingenious contrivance, wvhieh is coming into use, we understand, among turnip growers in Norfolk. The class of machines for preparing corn for market and for food is very largely represented. We have thrashing and winnowing-machines, combined and'separate, contrivances for hmummelling barley, for cru'shing grain as food for horses and grinding it as food for man, for cutting chaff and steaming it, and.other foeod for cattle, in endless number... And here it may be well to mention that all these implements have been exhibited at work by th e exhibitors themiselves during the past two days. Hitherto all such exhibitions were in the nature of trials, superintended by judges. This year -greater liberty is allowed to exhibitors, and it depends upon themselves alonehow far they may be able to satisfy purIhasers and spectators. This is a step towards that complete recognition - of mere competition as the true incentive to improvement for which agricultural machine makers have latterly been contending. They would prefer that the society should award no iiizes, but merely give opportunity to the exhibitors for a public performance of their respective machines. Or, if juLdges be appointed, that their award of meric,. and not a sum of money, should be the prize contested for. Turning to the cattleyard, two or three points in reference to it occupy a prominent place. In the irstplace, the show, of horses is remarkably numerous and and is distinguished from previous exhibitions of the kind bya spirited competition for the prizes offeredhythe local society for thoroughbred hackneysandliunters. A am,thereistheclassofprnzes offered for foreign stock, which, however, have not come forward in any great number, as indeed was not lkely considering the small prizes offered compared wtU the munificent encouragement which it is in the power of a Government to bestow. The small Bretonne race, somewhat like our breed in the Shetianclislands the large Normandy black and winte cisiry stock, and the magnificent white Charo- aisel breed, are allpresent, though not numerously so. The las, more especially, will receive the notice of English farmers. With the figure anld colour of the shorthorn the better bred specimens of this-rdca might well pass muster in an Englishahow. A -third characteristic of the Chehmsford meet ing: is the remarkable number and quality of the SouthIdown sheep exhibited, which. maywell be unprecedented, seeing. that Mfr. Jonas Webb, the premier breeder of the class, has this year-bnly a second prize awarded him. In shorthorns Colonel Towueley's magnificent roan bull "cMaster Butterfly" take3 the first prize, which he had soreceivedat the Paris meeting; and Mr. Ambler's second prize bull exhibited here is sire of the yearling, with which he also succeeded at the Paris meeting. Nothing is more extraordinary tharithe way in which the market value of ahor'thomn cattle has been maintained and inereased of- lteyears.. To Aeican demand Austallat ust now be aslded, azd large purchawes have been effected, *w i e a i beenAineffectually offered.- Mr. Ambler has sold hais Est prize bull calf, we -understand, for -I2 . and, for older animala higher prices have been offered than have-yet been recorded in the. history of the breed. -. - _ - The yearling heifer 'shiown byy Mr. Booith reeeiv|mg th:e Rot prize in. its class, is a beautiful animaL Hereforde are tolerably well represented, considering their distance from the county, and so also are the Devons. In the latter class wenaiss Lord Leicester's steck. MIost of the niamies; howvevei of our noted breeders will be seen upon the Devoi prize- H:is Royal Hiness Prince Albert tpIke& the Btst- prize for yearling, bulls, bred by Mr. G. Turner, of Barton, who also figures favourably. among the prizeholde&s. Mr. Quartly takes the first prize for old bulls; and MIessrs.- Farthing, alse, and Hole, all- well known names -in Devonshire, receive awards. - . - Inhorses for agricilturd. pu±poses we may just intimate that, notwitbstandingtlie great prop6ndeance of the Suiffolk breed as to number, andalso as to quality,the first prize for cart stallionsis takenby a Clydesdale horse, tha vpoperty of his oyalHig h- ness Prince Albert. The remarkable feature in the ihow of sheep is, as has been said, the number and the quality of the Southaown breed exhibited. Lord Walsingham's prize sheep is remarkable for their size es well as excellence. It are remarkable that none of the prizes go thisyear into Sussex, where the breed generally probably stiU retains its finest quality; the increased size attained elsewhere being inevitably to some extent accompamed by loss of quality. There is a small show of Leicester and of long-woolled sheep. The show of pigs is remarkably good, and to allthe classes we shall again refer ia individual detail. The poultry show-is without, as usual, much alteration. The following is the award of prizes AWARD OF PRIzES. SHORT-HORNS.

- DREADFUL COL1IERYEXPLOSZOsY. A frightful explosion of fire-damp occurrea in Cymmer Coliery on Taesday, by which it is feared the lives of all the men at work in the pit have been lost. At the usual hour in the morning the men went down into the pit, and shortly afterwards afeazfulexplosion of fire-damp took place. It is stated that a fire at one end of the pit was known to be burning, and it is suspected there must have been a fire in some other part also, the two causing the explosion. The catastrophe was soon known in the neighbourhood, and a harrowing scene ensued as men, women, and children frantically rashed to the pit's mouth to inquire or to search for seons, brothers, or fathers. The Cymmer coliery is in the Rhondda Valley, above Cardiff, in Glamorganshire. 116 men and boys went down to their usual work on Tues. day mornng, after tho " firemen" had pronounced all safe, and only six returned alive.. Almost every house has its bitter mowrner, its dead body too. Mr. George Owerton, of Merthyr, commenced his inquisition yesterday mo raing at the Ty Newydd, or lNew-house Inn,' at the upper end of the valley, Mr. hisoll, the proprietor of the colliery. beingpresent,anda highlyrespectable jury. The following names of the deceased were given:John Thomas, Henry Griffiths (boy), Badway, David Davies Thomas Davies, Thomas Davies, David Morgan, Thomas Matthews, ML Davies, David Daniel, Thomas David,Richard Rees, D. Morgan, W. Davies,.Johna Rees, Thomas Williams, boys of Hezekiah Davies, Enoch Morgan, David T.

The Coroner explained, in reading over the list of jurors, that he was alway; anxious in such cases to have some colliers on the jury, that practical knowledge might be brought I to bear upon the investigation. The jury then proceeded to view the bodies, which lay amid their sorrowing relatives, at their homes .in various parts of the valley. The spectacle in the great majority of caseswas frightful, the major part of the unfortunate deceased having met their deaths from the fire, not the choke. damp, the former causing the body to become charred, and literally scorched to almost a cinder, while the "damp" causes death by suffocation, and leaves bat littlo upon the countenance, except an expression like that of sleep. It appears that on Tuesday mcrning 116 or 117 men and boys went down into the Cymmer pit, little anticipating the horriblo catastrophe about to occur. The two fiemen, whose duty it was to examine the pit, to ascertain if there w5a any foul air or gas in the pit, reascended at about 6 oeclock, pronouncing the pit safe. In less than an hour after-indeed, before some had stripped off their clothes to commence work-the terrible gas exploded, and the affrigAted people ran hither and thither for a fewi moments. Then one fell in the dark, and others staggering along stumbled on their dead companion, and fell dead also. Here, some were struggling amid the tortures of the fire. Thero a tram fell of boys, all dead; and in other places, in sidings or niches in the level, men had sat down to awaib their feazful doom, and had died with their oldows resting on their knees and their facesburiea in their harnds. Some had struggled forward, no doubt hoping to reach the airways and possibly esape. When the report' of the explosion was heard on the surface, it was too well ipprehended what had occurred. Rumour says that for a day or two previously indications hadbeen given of what was about to occur.. "Blowers;, or casual explosions of gas, had' taken place. Two doorways had been blown down only on the previous day, and there wero too. many reasons, to believe, from the qutity of electricity with -which the air had been charged, that an explosion of a m6re extensive nature might* take place. This was too fully verified; and of the 200 colliers who worked in the Cymmer Colliery more than one-half were at a moment's notice swept into eternity. 116 human beings went down into the pit of death that morning, and of that host only six returned alive. The screams of the wives and mothers it the mouth of the pit-those women congregated there to await and recognize the dead-as during the long interval that ensued between the period when the first inteHigence of the explosion spread on Tuesday morning til the last body was brought out on the morning,of Wednesday-were frightful and distressing. All day loug she brave fellows who ventured down, almost in the face of death, to' bring up the dead- sent up the bodies of ihe unfertunate men and boys who had perished, and when these were brought to the surface the recognition of a beloved husband or darling child awoke harrowing cries. On Wednesday morning the 110th body was brought out, and( it was left to conjecture whether any still lay in the pit of death.. It "ws supposed; however, that all who had perished were now b,ltt tup. 'WhOrkuen were immediately put on to supply coMns for the dead. 'There they were, working hastily with the saw and plane, to construct rude shells in which to deposit the unfortunate dead in their untimely graves, amid the crowds iof eaperople, at Waiting to see the last of the dreadful HEer hajest's inspector of collieries, Mr. Evans, is -enj god ilt fellly elucidati the-fac The inquest as adjourned for a forinighl.

The position of -the Pasha of Egypt with -regard to the Sultan has, during the laat few weeks, undergone a material improvement. Some days after the arrival here of Redschid Pasha, a Turkish steimer of war made her, appearance, having on board an 'envoy from the Sultan, who brought to Said Pasha a sword and a robe of honour, to his son a sword and the title of Pasha, and three letters; sealed with the Sultan's own seal, 'which were pulblicly read at the Pasha's Palace - at Gabarri, in the presenco of all the Egyptian authorities and a great muster of troops. These letters place the Pasha again on a very friendly footing -vith the Sultan, and the purport of them was-1, to thank Said Pasha for the assistance afforded by Eypt during thelate war; 2, to announce tohimthe conelusion of the war; and 3, to accompany the presents. Said Pasha seemed much gratified by the honour thus shown him, his Highness received the letters and presents with the greates£ marks of respect, andc is evidently more at ease than when he was on cool-terms with his Sovereign, -thoug,h undoubtedly he,will havetopaylargely fort attention sown him.; Hlis sb, who was made a Pasha and commander-inehi6f of the Egyptian army, is not three years old,. and on the occasion of the investiture he was accom-. panied by 'his English nurse, away from whom he is not happy. It is a remarkable thing that' Said Pasha should with such entire confidence give up the eharge of his only son to an English woman, thus. breaking through thle prejudices of the eountry, and it was strange to see an unveiled woman, in a position of so much confidence, standing in the |midst of Pashas and Mussulmans of every order. Almost all the new relatives of the Viceroyare here just now, and frequently meet in friendly and social intercourse. Recdsehid Pasha is spending his time here very quietly, occupying the splendid palace of Raas-elteen, and it would appear that absence from Constantinople is the only reason for his present 'visit to Alexandria~. He will of course remain for the splendid fetes, which are to take place on the 16th inst., and for which Dreparations in the most magnificent and lavish style are being cimade. Hxer Mqajesty's surveying ship Tartarus airived yesterday from the coast of the Delta, where she has been surveying, and has gathered information which proves of imaportance when placed in con'nexion with the canai scheme of M. de Lesseps for the union of the Mlediterranean and Red Seas. It is true that six fathoms of wsater were found at a distance of a mile and a half fiom shore, five miles to the eastward of a place called Gemileb, but the ronstruction of a breakwater and jetty in such a position is still regarded as impracticable, and only to be effected at so enormous a cost that it would be impossible to estimate it with any approach to correctness. The deep water at one mile and a-half from the shore extends for only three miles; and towards Pelusium the depth of water is only five fathoms at five miles from the shore, and sin fathoins at six miles from the shore. The Tartarus was off the coast from the 26th of April to the 5th of July, and during the whole of that period of ten weeks, which is also the calmest season of the year, the steamer wasconstantly'labouring under a heavy rolling swell, even in the absence of wind. In the Lake MIenzaleh, where four or five feet of water were reported, a depth of only three feet was found. The Tartarus is to remain in this port until the summer heats are over, and it is to be hoped that during this time some arrangements will be made for a proper survey of the harbour, as no information can be gained from the native pilots, who are not kept in order bythe Govornment, and consequently do just-as they please. General d'Orgoni and the Burmese Commissioners to France are just now in Egypt. Mtr. John Cater, one of the London directors of the Bank of Egypt, arrived here on the 3d inst. by the French steamer, and yesterday the Bank of Egypt was opened for general business underfavourable auspices. The directors declare they have reason to be satisfied with the encouragement they have-received. Wheat; for delivery in September and October, is advancing in price. Freights are from 4s. 6d. to Ss. Od. per quarter, and the newr crops are slowly beginning to find their way dowvn as the Nile rises. Exchange on London is firm at- LOIpiastres per pound sterling. Arabia and the holy cities of 31ecca and Medina continue to be in a very disturbed state, and the last- Scheriff sOnt from Constantinople was not received by the inhabitants. The number of Mahomedan pilgrims proceeding this year to Mecca by the Red Sea is enormous.
IRBLAND. I (O OUR OWN- ) DUEBLI, WEDENZESDAI MORNING. TIPPIrERARY BAXK. An application was made yesterday in the Rolls' Court, on behalf of Mr. John Farmery Law, for liberty to go before the Master in Chancery, in order that he might- be struck out of the list of shareholders on whom calls had been made. It was stated that MIr. law was, in the mouth of February last, one of the paid and acting directors of the London and County Bank, and that upon the death of.the late John Sadleir, when his dealings and defalcations became publicly known, MIr. Law, being the owner of 50 shares in the Tipperas Bank, felt that he. could no longer act in that capacity, and redigned. Owing to his having been so involved in the Tipperary Bank shares, Mr. Law had been obliged to give up employments and offces of the annual 'value of from 80C1. tol,0001., including the directorship oi the London and County Bank and other appointments, all of which he lost in consequence of -his connexion with the affairs of the Tipperary Bank, so that he, in fact, was the greatest sufferer of any of the nglish shareholders. FThe appication was opposed on the part of the olicial manager, but the) Mfaster of the Rolls said he would m-ake the order. Though MIr. Law had beenmade the instrumlent for disposing o f the fraudulent shares, he believed-he was himself the dupe of John Sadleir. He thought the liability of a party might be contested, even though he had paid. [the call. In hisjudgment in " Re 1inger," he had exonerated Mfr. Law fromn fraud. - It was the fact tbat MIr. Law had purchased shares himself that satisfied him that he was not aware of the frauds of the Sadleirs. Mr. Law should pay to the official manager his costs of the motion, as it had beenrendered necessary by his own default. THE FUNDS. Three per Cent. Consols, M95I g; i1ew Three per Cent.
