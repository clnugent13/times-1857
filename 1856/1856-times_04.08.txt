TZE ENGLISH ROMAN CATHOL0S ON THE PEACE. The following "Address from the Archbishops and Bishops to the Clergy and Faithful of England," has been sent us for publication:- " Dearly Beloved Brethren and Children,-Health and BenedictioninOurLord.-Theconclusion of peace has come, not toto supersede,but to increase our Paschal joys. Our merciful God has sent us this blessing at a moment vhen we can commemorate it in gladness, when we can sing forth our thanksgiving without its joyous peals interfering with the i mourning of a penitential season, or jarring with the feelings of humbled and contrite hearts. The church is in her very highest season of gladness, because peace, eternal and irrevocable, as purchased for man by the Triumpher over death; and she can welltake in and unite withthellallelujas that commemorate that divine victory, the gatitude that results from an earthly, but awell-earnedpeace. "Scarcely, in.the churches of Paris, on Sunday last, had the sounds died away of the Gospel there sunig, in which is recorded our Saviour's salutation to his apostles, ' Peace be with you: my peace I leave to you, my peace I give to you' (John 20); when the canons' roar again awoke their echoes, and conveyed along theiraisles and naves, the joyful tidings of peace restored. They were the answer to the pysthousands ; of the e r,whosenecessitiesandsuffer- ndoubled byth pressure of the war; of the families that mourned over the absence and danger of some most dear to them; of the pious and virtuous who deplored the sins and offences that war always foments; of the priests and religious, who must ever look back upon it as a scourge of divine justice upon nations, to be averted or lightened by humiliation and expiation, " Yes, God has heard these multiplied intercessions, and has answered them in the very words of His Gospel; ' Peace be with you.' Peace had been so long our portion, that we had come to consider it the ordinary condition of nations and of the world. The evils and horrors of war belonged for us to history-nbt to the experience of our lives.. Many indeed of you, whom we address, have been born and educated in elap of peace; you have all your lives measured all things by its standard; you have seen and enjoyed tl:e abundance of all that man requires-t'.e prosperity of commerce, the gradual diminution of public burdens, the extension of easy and friendly communication with all the world, the extinctionof national animosities and prejudices. This state of things appeared to you secure for years to come, perhaps for ever. " But war came upon us almost unawares, and we found ourselves plunged in a moment into all the realities of a deadly conilict. It was aggravated also by every additional calamity, in the sufferings to which our troops were subjected during a considerable portion of the campaign, Brilliant as may have been the featsof our brave troopsand of our noble allies, they came to our ears accompanied by too vivid details of the havoc and distress of battle and of siege forus to claim and rejoice in their. glorv, without feeling, at the same time, the fearful and painful price atwhich it has been purchased We have weighed against it the widowed and fatherless homes which it costs, the sorrows of many for irreparable loss, the thousands of lives cut off in early promise; and, moreover, -the sufferings which indirectly it causes among the already poor and distressed. "War has taught us the blessings of peace-not, perhaps, sutfficiently prized. Though a severe, it has prove a mercifulinstructor; and wolonged to hearonce more those words which have no een spoken, ' Peace be with you.' You, dearly beloved, have shared with your fellow-subjects all the an2tieties of war. Your brothers, your children, your kin, and your friendshavebeen in every trench andin every field, in every hospital, and in every storm. The blood of your fatilies has been poured out as freely as that of any others, the valour of your brethren has been as devoted as that of their comrades in every warlike deed; and at home the uncomplaining cheerfulness with which you have borne the hardships resulting from war has been surpassed by none. These feelings of loyal devotion we, your pastors, have seconded and encouraged in every way. We enjoined public prayers for peace, so long as there was any reasonable prospect of its preservation; we prayed for the success of our arms while war continued; we ordered solemn expiation for the souls of the departed, and so now we wish to lead you in the expression of your thanlful joy for the restoration of peace. This joy is that of all Europe. Even those nations that have not engaged in the war have lent themselves zealously to the negotiations for a general paciication; and scarcely a remote province exists in the most distantkingdoms or States of the world which a ray vill not reach of the new day that is dawning on us. The church particularly, which has, since the days of Gregory, prayed m every nlass for peace, and whose mission it has always been to mitigate the evils of war, and diffuse charity through the world, will rejoice and thank God for this return of serenity and rest. And nowhere will her voice resound more loudli and more joyously than among our fellow Catholics in France, the faithful and powerful ally of our Crown in war, and its best confederate in peace; for there she will speak in the name of the entire nation, bound up together in unity of 'faith. And there, too, will the thanksgiving for peace almost mingle its notes with those of the Te Dcmun just recited for the signal favour with which our good God has crowned the domestic happiness of the Imperial house, in the son which the virtuous Empress has given to her august Consort. So consoling has this event been to our brethren, the Catholies of France, clergy, and laity, and so associated in time as in feeling is it with the proclamation of peace, that it would be almost impossible to separate the two in the sympathetic union of our gratitude with theirs. " Wherefore, dearly beloved, it havingzpleased Almighty God, that we, the bishops composing the entire Catholic hierarchy of En"land, with the exception of our venerated brother, the Bishsop of Birmingham, absent in Rome, should be assembled here at ourannual meeting, we have thought it becoming totestify in the most public and solemn manner our gratitude to the Divine Mercy for the great blessing granted us, and the hearty and loyal sentiment with which we join in hailing a that is conducive to the good and prosperity of our beloved conntry. We have therefore agreed to assist, in a body, at the celebration of a solemn mass of thanksgiving, followed by the Te Doum, in the church and pro-cathedral of St. Mary's, Moorfields, on Sun. day next, the second after Easter. And we shall, each of us, give our separate directions for this our example being followed in our respective dioceses. " Earnestly then we exhort you, dearly beloved, to unite your hearts and voices with ours in this expression of sincere gratitude to Him, who, if in the old law he wished to be called the Lord of Hosts and the God of Battles, in the new has loved rather to be known as the Prince of Peace, and the Father of that world to come which is in the Heavenly Jerusalem, the vision of Eternal Peace. " ' And the God of Peace crush Satan under your feet speedily,. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.' -Romn XVL, 20. " Given in London, at the Archiepiscopal residence, this 3d day of April, in the year of our Lord lg56. "Signed in behalf of the assembled bishops, "WILLs[ALr, Bishop of Plymouth." " We hereby desire that the above Address be read in everychurchandchapelof ourdiocess on thesecondSunday after Easter, April the 6th, and that on the following Sunday there be said or recited the hymn Te Dean~ in thanks. giving for peace; and that the collect pro Oratiarum Actiore be recited in the mass on that an onthe two following days. y " .

COMPULSORY EDUCATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-There is one question connected with LordJohn Russell's resolutions on education on which some of your readers may be able to give us some information. The examples of Prussia, Switzerland, and other countries. are cited as proof that compulsory education is not only possible, butworks well. I have some reason for believing that the authorities in these countries are muable to carry out the law, and are obliged, for the sake of peace, to wink at infractions of it, or be satisfied with very shallow excuses for non-compliance with it. In short, that if they attempted to apply the law for compulsory education strictly in every case popular opinion would rise up against it. No doubt many of your readers can tell us how far my suspicions are grounded in truth. If in Prussia and Switzer land legislative enactments to force instruction are inope. rative to any considerable extent, I thinkr we may foretell what would be their fate here. 4 I am. Sir. vour obedient servant. A LONDON CLERGYMAN. . Athen-eum, April 7.
IavERPooL, Monday.-The following was re- ceived at the Underwriters'-rooms yesterday:-"Advices from Gibraltar bring us the melancholy intelligence of the loss of the screw steamer Minho, Captain Marquillas, on her passage from this port to Barcelona. It seems that the ill-fated vessel, on the 28th nlt., when off Tarifa, came into collision with the transport ship Minden, and received such damage that she almost immediately sank. She had on board 115 souls, of whom only four passengers and 17 of the crew (21 in all) were saved. We regret further to learn that Captain Marquillas is supposed to have gone down with the steamer."

FATA Am MhNT ON THE CALD0oxrAR RAirwAY.-An accident, by which two persons were killed and others injured, occurred on the above railway yesterday morning. It appears that the mail-train started at 56 from Carlisle for Glasgow. with seven carriages and the Post-officevan attached. When about threemiles from Carlisle the engine-boiler burst, and the driver and stoker were instantaneously kiled, being thrown in different directions. Twopassengers, a lady and a gentleman, werelikewise injured. After the boiler burst the engine kept the rails for about 100 yards, when it bounded off, and separated from' the tender, making four or five summersaults endwva , and becoming embedded in a field to the left of the rails the tender also became embedded withi the field fence of the line. All the carriages were thrown offthe rails, one of them (a Perth carriage), containing three or fourpassengers, being turned upon its side. The gentleman alluded to was rather seriously injured; he now lies at the County HoteL The lady (from Mr. P. Dixon's, of Holm Eden), who was a passenger in the Perth carriage, was thrown underneath, but happily was not much hurt. If the end of the carriage had not broken, she must have been killed. About half-past 6 o'clock a messenger on horseback brought a report of the accident to the Citadel station, and Drs. Rae, Page, Carlyle, Steel, and Evans soon afterwards arrived on the spot. The names of the men killed areThomas Musgrave, engine-driver, who leaves a wife, but no children, and Isaac Sessford, stoker, who leaves a w,ife and six children. The bodies, which are much disfigured, especially that of Sessford, nowlie at the station-house. The engine is a comparatively new one, having been only seven months on the line. Its roof was blown off, and the accident cannot yet be accounted for. MIr. Carrick, county coroner, wil hold an inquest on the bodies to-day (Tuesday). The line has been cleared, but the engine, &c., stil1 lie for the inspection of the coroners jury. a aecount of the accident sent by another correspondent states that the gentleman had his coLlarbone much njured. The enginedriver, Musgrave, was thrown some 20 or 30 yards in advance of the train, and was picked up quite dead, being much scalded and bruised. The stoker was found in a field about the same distance to the right of the line, horribly mutilated. DissOLno.' OF A BAx AN\D SUDDEN DEATH OF THE M iL,GER.-Some excitement has been occasioned in Cheltenham by the sadden dissolution or cessation from business of the Cheltenham and Glocestershire Banking Company, aud thealmost simultaneous sudden death of the manager, Mr. Ridler, lately a candidate for the representa- fon of the borough in Parliament. The Cheltenham and Glocestershire Banking Company was established in 1S36, andagrand dinner given to celebrate the occasion. It was established by a political party supposed to represent the Liberal interest of the borough, and it continued to transact business up to theend of March last, when it was suddenly announced that the business had been transferred to the County of Glocester Bank. This, of course, caused a "r un" upon the Cheltenham and Glocestershire, but we believe every check was honoured and every note cashed. The immediate cause which led tothe suspension of business was, it is pretty weU understood, the complete exhaustion of its capital, occasioned by losses which have overbalanced the profits. Therefore the managers of the bank decided to close business while they were yet in a favourable position to discharge their liabilities, which have, we believe, hitherto been liquidated on demand. It is presumined that the shareholders will be the sufferers, audthat they will lose nearly the whole of the money invested in the concern. The bank, we believe, has regularly declared a dividend of 5 and 6 per cent. According to the original prospctus, the capital was to have been 500,0001., in 10,000 shares of 501. each, but only the first instalment of 5?. was ever paidup. The shares at onetime sold at 61. and 71., and even Sl. and 91., but latterly they havegone downuto about 31. and 41. The average weekly circulaton of late did not exceed 10,0001. A meeting of the shareh'olders is to be held in a fortnight. While the townwasyet ringing with the news oftho stoppage of business atthe ban it was announced that Mlr. cidler, the manager, and who offered himself for Cheltenham at the last election, had been found dead in his bed. He had been much depressed in spirits of late, and at about 12 o'clock ook some medicine (morphine). He was alwve at 6 o'clock next morning, but at 8 he was dead. A; Fi,ocic OF RAHID Sssamr'-We are sorry to record a severe loss that has been sustained by a hard working farner named Willis, of Nuffield, near Nettlebed. It appears that on the morming of the 17th of February last, Wimllis's son went to the fold, which contained 72 very fine ewes heavy in lamb. He discovered a large wiry-haired lurcher in the fold, and two ewes dead; the dog came growling at him, but after pelting him with stones he made off toiards Nettlebed. Willis and his father then found that two more sheep were so greatly torn about that they were compelled to kill them; the four ewes had seven lambs when opened. It was further discovered that about 20 more were bitten, more or less, about the nose and ears. These they deed, and put in a fold by themselves; but two or three weeks after several of them began to show symptoms of madness, and 15 of them lambed, the lambs being brought up by hand. The ewes went into a rabid state, trotted backwards and forwards by the sides of the hurdles, and repeatedly bit the hurdles, and toremoutbfuls of wooloutof eachother, foamed atmouth, &c. Twenty-two are since dead, and there are five more that were slightly bit, which no doubt will also die before many days. The mad lurcher afterwards attacked two dogs, which were soon shot ; it next ran to Mr. Corderer's farm atILashbrook, and fell on his dogs; but that gentleman, suspecting the dog to be mad, shot him, and then his own dogs, and consigned their bodies to the riverThames.-Reading Afercury.

NAYAL AMD MLTARY I-KT.LLIGENCE. A partial rehearerl of the movements to be executea by the fleet at the forthcoming grand review by the tuee2 was executed yesterday. The Gorgon steameloop, Comn. mander I. B. Crawford, and the Merlin, Captain Sulian, .B., were despatched early in the morning to the estward to take up positions as the distance posts for the fleet; this was about three miles to the eastward of the Nab Light, and off Hayling Island. At 8 o'clock the fleet crossed topgallant and royal yards, unmoored ship, and lighted fires to get up steam, and at 9 they were ordered to prepare to weigh. At about 10 minutes to 10 Vice-Admiral Sir George Seymour, X.C.B., the Commander-in-Chief, embarked in the steam yacht Fire Queen, Master-Commander F. W. [Paul, and with his flag at the fore steamed out to the fleet. He was accompanied by Captain of the Fleet the Hon. F. T. Pelbam, C.B., Cap. tain the Hon. J. R. Drommond, C(B., of the Victory . Captain Sir Thomas Miaitland, Ã¯Â¿Â½.B., of the Excellent; Captain G. Eliott, of the St. Vincent ; and Flag-Lieutenant PechelL On ariving atSpithead Sir George Seymour trasferred his flagto the 46-gun frigateArrogant, Captain Lyster: Rear-Admiraithe Hon. Sir Richard Saunders Dundas, X.C.B., and Rear-Admiral Baynes, C.B., remained on board their respective flagships, Dluke of Wellington aud Retribution; Rear-Admiral the Right Hon. Sir X. F. F. Berkeley,. Ka..B., MLP., and a party went out in the Admiralty yacht Black Eagle; the Lightning steamvessel, Lieutenant-Commander Campbell, and Vivid, Mster-Comnander W. IL Allen, were also out with the Admirals; Rear-Admiral Superintendent Martin, with Captain Harris, of the Illustrious, and other officers, was also out in the sailing yacht Portsmouth, and the roadstead was studded with yachts of private persons. At 1030 the fleet weighed in two columus, the line-ofbattle ships first, frigates and smaller>-essels following, the -Commander-in-Chief in the Arrogant leading, the others followng according to seniority. As they stood out from ;the anchorage they preseuted a grand spectacle. Having run the distance marked by the two stationary vessels, Gorgon and Merlin, the weather division rounded the Gorgon orthewesternmostvessel, and thelee divisionrounded the Merlin or the leeward and easteruimost vessel, and made towards Portsmouth again in the same order as on going out, and anchored in line at about 4. The Duke of Wellington and Royal George, three deckers, are now the leading ships to the eastward, reaching nearly to St. Helen's, and the line stretches far off Ryde in the westerly directiom Two divisions of gunboats were "aweigh" at the same time, and manceuvring in various parts of theroadste*4 Sir George Seymour took his station between the two lines of the fleet on returning, the better to observe thcir movements, and hoisted the signal to disregard the motions of his flagship. When off the Spit-buoy the signal was made to anchor in two lines, or in order of sailing before indicated, On the passage back to Spithead the steam yachts Black Eagle and Vivid and the steam despatch gunvessels Itrepid and Coquette, Commanders Wood and Risk;, were ordered to try rate of speed in a run from about three miles below the N'ab to Cowes; but the superiority of the Vivid was speedily so manifest that al competition was out of the question; the gunvessels were pretty nearly equal, and kept within half a-mile of each other all the distance run; one went 0I4 and the other 10 knots, while the Vivid went 12. A third squadron of gunboats was exercised in firing off Osborne. The day being beautifully fine and clear, thousands of spectators thronged the walLs of Portsmouth, the pier at Ryde, and the shores on bothL sides of the anchorage, to wit. ness the movemerts of the ships, which will be put through a more complete rehearsa of the movements to be performed at the great review of the 16th or 17th (for there seems much indecision about the day, although we adhere still to the former date) to-morrow or Thursday. As the fleet was anchoring it was joined by the Cssar, 91, Captain Robb, from Kiel; and the others of Captain Watson's squadron are supposed to be close at hand. The Rodney, 90, Captain Wilson, was taken out of the bas;a at Portsmouth yesterday and to her hulk, to receive her crew and ship her guns. The Perseverance steam troopship was towed to Spithead yesterdayand anchored. The Colossus, Brunswick, and Sanspareil did not weigh with the fleet yesterday. The paddlewheel vessel Kite, having completed her re-, pairs, has been warped out of the fitting basinat Woolwich. On Sunday a number of hands were transferred from the receiving-ship Fisgard to enable her to assist in towing the mortar floats down the river. She was soon under way, with four of these vessels in tow, for Sheerness. The artisans and labourers, consisting of shipwrights, caulkers, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, painters, smiths, &c., engaged on board the gun and mortarboats, were on, Sunday employed in their ordinary labour at Woolwich Dockyard from 6 to 10 a.m., and from 5 to 9 p.m., and, as a number of these vessels anrive at Woolwich vith a considerable portion of the contractors' work unfinished, the whole of their men were likewise busily employed on Sunday. The Porcupine, 3, paddlewheel steamer, Lieutenant-Commander George M. Balfour, has arrived atW,oolwich for the purpose of assistdng in the conveyance of mortar vessels to Sheerness. Yesterday afternoon the ceremony of launching the Victor Emmanuel from the ship-yard of the Victoria Foundry Company, Greenwich, was performed in the presence of a vast number of spectators. Miss Airey, eldest daughter of Professor Airey, undertookthetask of namoingthe vesseL The principal dimensions ofthe vessel,which is built of iron, are -length between perpendiculars, 160 feet; ditto over all, 185 feet ; breadth of beam, 27 feet; depth of hold, 16 feet; draught of water, 12 feet. The tonnage is about 600 tons old measurement. She has a splendid saloon for the accommodation of passengers, and is adapted for carrying 1,000 tonsofmeasurementgoods. Sheisfittedwith an auxiliary screw steam propeller. Her enginesIre of 90-horse power. Her name was suggested by the recent visit of the King of Sardinia to this country. Her Majesty's gunboat Fidget, one of two vessels which the above company are under contract to build for Government, was launched a few minutes after the Victor Emmanuel. This is the first gunboat built at Greenwich. Her sister boat, the Flirt, is in a very forward state, and vill soon be ready for launching. The dimensions of the Fidget are-length between perpendiculars, 100 feet; breadth, 21 feet 10 inches; depth, 6 feet 6 inches; draught of water, 4 feet; tonnage, 212 tons. The Etna, 16, floating battery, which was launched at Chatham dockyard on Saturday afternoon, has been taken under the shears, for the purpose of having hermasts placed on board. She willbe taken to Sheerness dockyard, for the purpose of being made ready for sea. The detachment of Royal Artillery under orders to proceed to Halifax have embarked on board the Lady Amherst freightship, 446 tons' burden, which arrived off Woolwich on Saturday evening. The shipment of 3,000 quarter barrels of ball cartridges and powder was effected without delay on Sunday, and the troops, consisting of 83 non-commissioned officers and privates, under the command of Lieutenant WVatson, andmedically attended by Staff-AssistantSurgeon Semple, embarked yesterday at noon. The Lady Amherst isto sail from Woolwich this morning for Halifax direct.
THE TICKET-OF-LEA YE SYSTE 1l TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Wiil you permit me to call attention to the case of a burglary tried at Liverpool, before lz. Baron MTartin, on the 33st of March, and reported in 17w Tiies of theIst of April? John 3MBride and Thomas Garrett, two ticket-ofleave men, and Robert Roberts were indictedfors6burgilary in the house of Timothy Gil, at Liverpool, on the 19th of January last. The jury returned a verdict of " Guilty." It appears from your report that some observations were made by the counsel for the defence respccting the conduct of the police, and the learned Judge said:-" In this case they (the police) had literally done their duty, and nothing more, and it was necessary such characters should be watched; in fact, life and property would not be safe without it." And subsequently-The learned Judge, then, addressing the prisoners, announced that 3rBride had been previously convicted for various offences no less than 17 times, Garrett 11 times, and Roberts once -' and his Lordship sentenced I'Bride and Garrett to ten years', and Roberts to four years' penal servitude. So far, -well and no doubt the good people of Liverpool wiU sleep mare composedly now, as they will probably suppose that these desperate characters are deprived of the power of doing further mischief by breaking into aend robbing their houses and terrifying them out of their lives. But how long can the Liverpool public expect to be free from the depredations of these men ? rBride, it is slated, obtained a ticket-of-leavo after being convicted 17 times! What reason is there to hope that one more conviction VFil prevent his getting a ticket-of-leave again; and, if he does, what hope is there that he will not resume his vicious habits, and resort to crime as a means of avoiding starvation? . I presume, as a matter of course, that Garrett will soon be at liberty with a ticket-of-leave ; 11 convictions will preEent no obstacle. Can it be ex?ected that men with such characters wi be able to obWin a living by any honest means?. It appes to me that "life and property are not safe?' under this system, and that the time has arrived when some symjpathy should be shown for the public as weU as for the cnminals; - e e Your obedient rArvx-nt A NERVOUS MAN.

THE MOON HAS NO BOTARY MUOTIONY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-May I request the favour of a smaU space in r columnsto inquire the grounds upon which almost allscbeol astronomy books assert that the moon rotates on ber axis I This theory is positively stated in Sckdlcr's Bosk '4f. Nfaturc,-a work of authority in Germany, and it bas ' ut received the high sanction of 1Mr. J. R. Bind in his edition of Keith Johnslon?s New Atlas of Astronomy. ITlie ii is there said to "revolve round our globe in a period oW='22 days 7 hours and 43 minutes, and to rotate upon ber aXis in precisely the same interval, whence it occurs that only.wkobalf of the moon can ever be seen from the earth." On the contrary, if the moon turned at all on her Axis, a little consideration will shov that all her surface would oe successively shown to the earth, and that it is because she has no rotary motion at all that one side urny is seen by us. She performs precisely the same motion in. relation to the earth that a point on the tire of a wheel does to the bo; or axle, or that the round end of the minute-hand. of a watch does to the pivot in the centre. It is easy to constrtictasmallinstrumentsimilartothis.byfixingabal lon one end of a strip of wood, to represent the earth, and fastened by a pivot serving as its axis, and on the other end a smaller ball, also fastened by a pivot. If the strip of wood be turned round on its pivot at the end representing the earth the smnall bail il exactly represent the moon, and will present the same face (through the whole of its revolution) to thelarge ball; but if the small ball he made to rotate oer its axis ever so little it wi7l immediately present a change of face to the larger ball, and so -would the moon to the earth. If the earth moved round the moon, then therotation imputed to her in the same period as the earth's revolution round her would be necessary to her presenting the same face to us. The error is not only prevalent and unaccountable, but it interferes with some very interesting and ingenious theories based on the oblate surface of the moon on this side and her convexity on the other, which aye occasioned by the fact that she is centrifugal without rotation. I a2n. Sir. vour obedient servant. -_ JELINGER SYMONS, Tmer m estrysm sinpector ol 15choL0,s. The Vineyard, me&r Hereford, .April 5.

Rie is the youngest son of Lord Castle-maine, and, in the event of a split or splits in the Liberal councils, he would have a fair chance of carrying the day, and of thus further -weak-ening I the Palmerston Govermment by a third defeat on Irish soil. TiIE SADM YRACDS. The Cadlotw. Sentinel states that there are but too good reasons for believing, from circumstances which have recently transpired, that the assets of the Tipperary Bank will fearfully disappoint the deporitors. The overdue bills are now in course of collection,obut a very considerable amount of these will not be available at present, although sonie of the parties primarily liable will be sued without delay, under the instructions of the official aszignee and his solicitor. The Carlow paper safely adds,- " We fear, from a perusal of the proceedings on Tuesday, that the personal property of John Sadleirmaybe termednil, the principal portion of the property he acquired in the Enciunbered Estates Court being assigned to other parties, epecially to the London and County Bank. Indeed, the pictures of misery- w-hich are submitted almost daily to'our notice by correspondents forcibly reauinds us of John Sadleir's confession, that the criminal acts he committed during his awvful career would ruin thous.ands of poor industrious people, whose earnings for years were swept away by that terrible speculating gambler." F3UG1UTINOX. The Galway papers complain that, notwithstanding the "disgraceful and ungrateful" treatment, the result of the machinations of the Know-nothing party, which Irish emigrants have met of late at the hands of the Americans, emigration from the western province still continues, not in such numbers as heretofore, but still to an extent that may eventuallymilitate very much against the agricultuLral interests of Ireland. One of the local journals says:- "A stop had been put, as we conceived, to this fearful drain of the most useful of our countrymen; but within the lat few veeks the drain has commenced again, and evcry day almost wvitnesses crowds of decently-dressed and comfortable-loolking eamigrants proceeding to wvhat was once regarded, and truly was, the land of freedom and of 3;indness, to Irishmeninparticular. Crowds of these self- nisin", or ' lawv-exiled' wvanderers proceed by train to Li;verpoo'-; and the Clarenlce is .about to sail from this port with a full complemsent for the shores-the once hospitable, but, *ve fear, no inhospitable shores of America."
MR. OROKER AND MR. HAYWYARD. TO TEIE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Whether the translation of M. deMIontalembert's work be a good one or not, it is for the public to decide. I thought it good enough to recommend it to Mr. Murray, and he tells me that he is perfectly satisfied with it. There my responsibility ends-though I may add that there is nothing in 31r. Hayward's poor criticisms-small blots that he cackes, not It its-which would make me, if I was its author, in the slightest degree reluctant to avow it. The tone and the matter of Mr. Hayward's letter in this day's 7'imes would afford ample room and a complete justification for a very sharp answer, which might, I think, amuse the town at illr. Hay-ward's expense; but I shall content myself with nailing him down to some matters of fact, which may create an impression on the public mind about him even less agreeable than ridicule might be. I begin by recalling the fact that in my former letter I convicted M1r. Hayward of representing me as the translator, -when he had in his hands the best possible evidence that I 'was not so. He now pretends to justify that wilful misrepresentation, by stating that a "prefatory notice" to the volume talk-s of the translator as " he," whereas "H H. B." is a woman; as if anything was more usutal or more natural than that anlonynmouts female translators, editors or authors, should, instead of parading their sex in a preface, make use of the masculine, and not the feminine pronoun. But even this pitiful salvo shall not serve Mr. Haywrard. This" notice" takes the place of an " introductioe' wvhicl I had written, and which, as MIr. Hayward so far truly states, was communicated to him. To this " introduction'" he made several objections; and, as I have heard from MIr. Murray, prohibited the publication of the translation with that preface; which was accordingly omi*ted. But your readers, even after what they have alreadyseen of Mlr. Haywvard'sevasive dealing with facts, will be surprised to learn that in that ery " ialtoc7tioxl," communicated to Air. Hayward in print, and elaborately examined and commented upon by-him, the "editor" and "translator' are seDarately mentioned, and the special responsibility of the " eclitor" distinctly marked. In order, I presume, to palliate the inconsistency or to evade the ridicule of having approached "I tith the hiJighest Xe-pect" one whom he now, on no provocation that I can guess, treats with so little, Mr. Hayw,ard says " he should not have written to Mr. Croker at all but for a circumstance wrhich Mr. Croker has passed over in silence. Although ' Dioit de teadsiction resevWi' is printed on the titlepage, he set to work without paying the author the compliment of applying to him." I reply that I was silent as to this circumstance for a good reason, namely, that it is absolutely untrue. The translation was commenced and adv-anced from the original publication-a French misceUany, where it had no title-page, nor any reservation of the right of translation. Nor did I or the transi,tor suspect any difliculty of that kind till about the time that Mr. Murray informed Us that it was removed. Having set right these matters of fact, I leave the rest of Mlr. Hayward's rigmarole to answeritself; b-ut both the translator and I think it due to ourselves to re-state, that it was the first part only of 31. de Montalembert's work that wve had any intention of reproducing, and that when the second part reaehed us we were both so surprised and vexed at the extravagant bigotry and nonsense of several passages that we wereLthe translator qtuite as much as I-on the point of giving up the publication altogether, and woould have done so, buit for the motive expressed in the following passage of the intencled "introduction," which was communicated to MIr. Hayward:- " But even these errors are not, if duly considered, with-out their value. The Anglican Church fears no discussion, -and, on the contrary, we" (" tze translator end cditor," a3 we hadtermed ourselves in the preceding sentence)-"wee are satisfied that the discussion raised by M. de Montalembert may be of great use, by reviving public attention to the indefatigablc and encroaching spirit of Romanism among us. The Ultra;montane extravagance to vhich a mind in other respects so clever and well-constituted as that of M. de TiontLlembert may be carried away is certainly a rconder, but it should also be a lesson." *When this introduletion wvas omitted the translator felt it necessary (and so did I) to prefix the protest already mentioned against the author's religious extravagance.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your very graphic notice of the new Mnusemn of Science and 1rt now in course of erection at Kensington Gore there are one or two errors which we would ask your permission to rectify. It is stated that *-the architect of this building is Sir William Cubitt, the wvorking plans being prepared by Mr. Crowley." The fact is. besides our firm being the contractors for the works the building is constructed from drawinrs prepared exclusively by ourselves, these and all their details having been submitted to Sir William Cubitt (as being one of the Royal Commis-sioners), whose concurrence they received, before the plan of the building was definitively deternined on by the Royal Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851.

THE VALUE OF SOLDIBRS' LIV-ES. TO THE EDITOR OF TifE TD[ES. I - Sir,-Iln she report of the commission appointed by the MIinister of War to inquire into the state ofI the British hospitals at Scutari and in the Crime& the following passage occurs in the evidence given by Dr. Brush, the surgeon of the Scots Greys:- "With the French authorities I believe the greatest deference is paid to the medical department, and every assistance rendered them; nobody has presumed to say that this is the case in the British service; it is a notorious fact that the reverse holds good. When a man gets sick, he is handed over to the doc. tor, and, generally speaking, nobody but the doctor takes much interest in him. During the time I have been in the Crimea,-that is, since the Landing of the regiment, in September last, up to this date (January 23, 1855), no General officer has visited my hospital, nor, to my knowledge, interested himself in any way about the sick. What is the cause of this apparent apathy it is isnpossible for me to conject ure, but this I maintain, and this I would most earnestly beg to impress on the minds of the gentlemen whom I have now the honour to address, that, unless General officers or those high in command do take an interest in their sick soldiers or until they do lend a helping or a wil- ling hand to their medical officers, it will not be possible for' the duties of the medical department to be satisfactorily and efficiently carried on in the field." The report of Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch shows that during the campaign to which the above extract refers thirty-five rne out of every hundred died. Of these a very small portion perished by shot and sword. The majority (lied from sickness and hardship. It is thefashion amongfashionable people to ascribe this unparalleled mortality entirely to overwork in the trenches; bat the portion of the army to which Dr. Brush refers-the cavalry-was exempt from work in the trenches, and was not in any way overworked. The General who commanded that portion of the army -Lord Lucan-is now making his explanations before the Chelsea Board of Inquiry. The Colonel who commanded, and who still commands, the regaiment to which Dr. Brush belonged, and still belongs (Colonel Griffiths), wiU be examined by his Lordship to-morrow. Dr. Brush's testimony is official; it states facts, for the accuracy of which that gentleman has pledged his professional position; for, could his accuracy be called in question, it is easy to surmise what would have befallen him long agowhat befell Surgeon Bakewell-instant dismissal from the service without trial or opporitnity of explanation. Soldiers' lives being unquestionably valuable things, not only to the country which trains, pays, clothes, and feeds them, but even to themselves and their parents, wives, and children, I conceive that the present opportunity for eliciting some notice of Dr. Brush's astounding statement ouht not to be allowed to pass awvay. I may as well add that Dr. Brush was no novice in military matters when he landed in the Crimea. Ee had previously served with the Cameronians (26th Foot) through the war in China, and bears on his breast for his good services two medals and three clasps. M.D. Apil 7, 1605. _
THE BISHOP OF BA.VGOR AGAI! TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-From the English C0uaclrcman of Thursday last I copy the following passage:- "W e observe that the Examinier has followed The Tines in representing the Rev. P. E. Ellis as alluding to the question of two services on a Sunday when he denied that the Bishop's judgment was godly." Noow, this is a wilful and wicked falsehood, and yon or one of your underlings whom you may have employed to make this statement well knew that it was a wilful and wicked falsehood when you had the shameless audacity to publish it.. On what occasion he did tell iue that my judgment was not godly wil appear in an extract from my letter to Mr. Stanley of February 7. Five years ago it came to my knowledge that Mr. Ellis had made a violent attack on Mr. Trevor in two local newspapers. I had not read that letter, and did not kanow what its object and language were. Upon hearing what Mr. Ellis had done I wrote to him expressing my disapprobation of his conduct, pointing out the impropriety of clergymen attacking one another in newspapers, and admonishing him to desist from such a practice. To my great surprise, instead of expressing his regret for what he had done, and promising never to repeat the offence, he wrote me a silly and impertinent letter about the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the press, and told me that he should do so again whenever he thought proper. After endeavouring in vain to convince him of his folly, I reminded him of the promise he had made at his ordination, reverently to obey his ordinary and other chief ministers of his church, and to foRow with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions. He then had the assurance to tell me that my remonstrances and the admonitions I had given him to behave himself in a more peaceable, charitable, and Christian manner were not godly judgments. I need not saya word more of the dishonesty and wilfulness of the lie which you have published. The Bishop of Bangor sends the Editor of 27e Tines a copy of a note which he wrote to Mr. Stanley on Saturday:- "As MIr. Stanley has shown that he is in close correspondence with the Editor of The Times, the Bishop of Bangor hopes he wil inform him that his (Mr. Stanley's) assertion that Mr. C. WiiUiams and other clergymen had written to the Bishop, as weU as the Dean, on the same subject, is a wicked and wilful filsehood; that neither the Dean nor any of my clergy ever did so; and that the lie which his evil spirit had told him about Mr. C. Williams, his former best friend and patron, is an astounding instance of his baseness and audacity, and of Mr. Stanley's weakness and folly in believing him. " April 5." It is now evident that Mr. Stanley has retained your services, since he has published the letter which I wrote to you a week ago, when I sent you a copy of my reprint of the correspondence. Mr. Stanley, I dare say, pays you well for doing his dirty work. I must remind you that neitiier my remarks on' Mr. Stanley's pamphlet in 1843, nor the reprint of the correspondence whieh he sent to the .Vort& lWales C7Nrontdc have been, in the booksellers' sense of the word, published. They have been printed for circulation among my friends and any other persons to whom I may think fit to send them. C. BANGOP Luaungy's dotci, 1, Regent-,treet, April 7. .

BEGGING LETTER IMPOSTORS. TO THE ED)ITORVOF THIE TMEnS. Sir,-The following statement of facts may be of use in two ways-first, in saving the pockets of some of the benevolent among your readers; and, secondly, in spoiling the trade of a great scamp. A certain J. P. (I will not name him for the sake of his friends, -who are, I believe, respectable) wrote to me a few days ago from Church-street, Deptford, stating in a letter of six pages, closely written, that he was the son of a clergyman, and himself originally intended for holy orders, bet that, owmng to the embarrassed state of his fathers affairs, he had been unable to complete his education at college; that he was at this moment reduced by severe iillness to the lowest state of destitution and distress, but had, he thanked God, at last obtained a situation of 20s. a-week at 3Messrs. Scott Russell's, a certificate to which effect was enclosed; but that his clothes were pawned to the amount of 35s., his " fondly attached wife" extremely ill, and he himself unable to work for want of clothes and a little nourishing food. Then Canme a long quotation from Scripture as to the coming of that night when no man can work, and an intimation in the same sentence that a trifle, per post-office order, would set him up for life and make him a truly happy man, ko. In answer to tl-, I am ashamed to say, I enclosed him a Itrife, saying that it would depend upon the result of t inquiries whEich I should make whether 1 could do anything more for him. By return of pest I received a longr reply, saying that the relief I had sent him had enabled him to buy a loaf of bread and a few coals, and entreating me to send a few old clothes and shoes and a trifle in money, if it were only os. HIis most urgent want was to be able to partake of the Holy Communion on Sunday, " under the advice of his spiritual director,"2 and he wvas very anx;ious to be able to put a trifle into the alms-dish for the benefit of the poor. This was followed by an abundance of Scriptural quotaltions, and 'by the expression of most piouts sentiments so worded as to excite far- more of suspicion than of sympathy. Before writing to him again I thought it as well to refer for informuation to thesecretary of the Mendicity Society, and I found, as I anticipated, that the ma n was well known to them. It appeared that he was a man of "'very depraved habits," and accustomed to ill-treat his "fondly attached wife" with whom he had frequtent quarrels, and that the language of both, under these circumnstances, was disgusting in the extreme; that he was in the habit of. drinking to excess, and had been given up as hopelessly depraved by his friends, who, some years ago, to give hhn a chance of recovering his position, paid his passage out to Australia, only, to have him return on their hands by the first opportunity. This being the case; I have written to Dlr. J .E. toinfomru him that I have sent -11,ls. fok the benefit of himself and his confreres to the Mendicity Society. Your obedient sezvant,- WHARTWIN B.

PABLIAM1rNTA)BY INTELLIGENBCE. - . HOUSE OF LORDS, MosY, A 7. - The LoPD CaAiCErLor. took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock. The Earl of EGIlNTOUN presented two petitions praying for the better regulation of unlicensed brokers in ScotJand. AUSTRALIAN POSTAGE. The Earl of HARDWICKE rose to put a question to the Postmaster-General in reference to Australian postage. The noble lord said that in the year 1852 there was established a system of steam navigation for the conveyance of mails between this country and Australia, which, though not entiredy satisfactory, insured to that colony a monthly mail, conveyed in anaverage passage of 64 days. That system was broken up in the year 1864, and since then there had been no regular mail service, the mails having .been.conveyed principally by merchantmen. Hle w;as informed, howrever, that it was not entirely owing to the war that the communication which had before existed had been put an end to. Ead it not been for mercantile speculations and other circumstances connected with commerce the communication might have been maintained. Her Majesty's Government had now, as it appeared, seriously turned their attention to the subject, and an advertisement had been inserted inthe public journals in February lust, inviting tenders to be sent for the re-establishment of the communication. No intimation, however, had been given in that advertisement as to the route which was to be taken. Unfortunately, owing to the manner in which the Government intended to proceed in the matter, some delay must take place before the communication could be re-established. At least 18 months must elapse before anything could be settled. The Government had declared thatbefore they came to any determination on the subject they must. communicate with the various colonies, for the purpose of ascertaining what they would contribute from their own funds towards the establishment of a regular line of communication. This was the first time that such a proposition had been made to any of our colonies, but he understood that the colonists themselves were perfectly ready to provide a certain sum for the purpose. Such communication, he thought, was quite unnecessary. There was no reason why one of the tenders should not at once be accepted, the route chalked out, and the mails despatched by it. He understood that there was a body of gentlemen now in this country authorized to treat with the Government on behalfof the Australian colonies on this subject, andthattheylhad declaredthat they wereprepared to advance a very considerable sum of money. It appeared by apetition presented to the other House of Parliament a few days ago that the colonv of Victoria had appropriated 50,000M. a-year for the purpose, and the colony of New South Wales 20,0001. a-year. With regard to the route, he could not seewhya direct lineshould not betaken; and why, instead of going by Ceylon and Singapore and so on to the coast of Australia, the steamers shoi Id not make directly from Aden to the Island of Diego Garcia, and thence to King George's Sound and Melbourne, leaving the colonists to establish branch lines from their own ports to Melbourne. The route by Diego Garcia was shorter than the Cape route by 3,319 miles, and 2,338 mniles shorter than the route by Singapore. By looking at the map it would be seen that this route would represent the string of a bow, the route by Singapore representing the arc. In the present state of steam navigationt, he had no hesitation in sying that there was nothing il the shape of tides, currents, rocks, or shoals which could prevent steamers from taking this direct line. The noble lord coneluded byaskingwhether there was anyobjection to the production of the memorial presented by the General Association of the Australian Colonies to the Treasury on this subject? The Dauke of ARGYLL said, the Government were deeply impressed with the importance and necessity of re-establishang assoon aspossible aregularpostalcommunication withthe Australian colonies. Inpursuanceof aTreasuryminuteonthe subject, tenders had been sent in which were now under the considerationof theGoverament. Itwasperfectlytruethatthe Treasury did not specify the route to be taken, but that did not imply that the Government were not to select a par. ticular route; and the object of not specifying a particular route was to test the comparative expense of the different routes, as they mnight be estimated by the contractors. He did not think that the memorial to which the noble earl had alluded was drawn up with very great care in regard to the comparative distance of the different routes, for it specified that the route by Diego Garcia was shorter than any other route by 2,338 miles, whereas it would be found by looking at the chart that it was only 1,100 miles shorter than the Singapore route. The route by Singapore, too, was not the only eastern route; there was another considerably shorter, which had already been indicated-that by the Point de Galle. With regard to the question of delay, the GBovernment were not at all inclined to postpone the settle. meat of the question, but under the new arrangement it was expected by the mother country that the colomies were to bear a considerable portion-at least half-of the expense, A s the colonies were willing to bear a portion of the expense, he thought it would be desirable that their opinions should be known on the subject, especially as many of the colonies offered contributions on conditions not easily reconcileable with each other. If a satisfactory arrargement could be arrived at ia this country it might not be expedient to wait for the assent of every one of the colonies. The Treasury minute had been sent out on the 4th of November, and before any final arrangement would be made in this country it was probable that the assent of the colonies to the general principle sketched out in that minute would be obtained. There was no objection to the production of the, memorial desired by the noble earL. THE CURRENCY. The Earl of EGLINTOUN rose to call the attention of the Government to the expediency of issuing a Royal commission to inquire into the operation of the laws which regulate the currency of the united kingdom. He feared that many of their lordships might have viewed the notice he had given on this subject with some feeling of alarm, as it was a subject very difficult to understand, and from which most men therefore naturaUy shrank; but he assured their lordships that he would abstais from indulging in anyvague theories or long calculations of figures, and would merely endeavour to convince them that a searching inquiry into the system now established was, if not necessary, at all events desirable. He thought the present a proper time for inquiry on the subject, on account, in the first place, of the position in which the Bank charter now stood. The present charter -was established in 1844 for 10 years, after which it was liable to be terminated by one year's notice. The Bank might consequently be said to be now waiting for a new charter, and he believed that few persons would desire to see a new charter granted without the subject undergoing a most searching investigation. Another reason which made him think that this was ,a proper time for commiencing this inquiry was the circumastance that a peace was now about to commence which was likely to be enduring, from the prostration of the Northern aggressor and the intimate alliance of the great countries of Europe. The country was now, probably, on the eve of a career of considerable commercial enterprise, and of a state of internal tranquility, and content almost unparalleled, and on this account, too, he thought the period favourable for inquiry. In 1848, in consequence of the severe monetary crisis which took place in the preceding year, committees of both Houses were appointed to inquire into the causes and amount of the distress which then spread ruin over the country. Both committees were equally ansious to discharge their duty properly; but the result was, that they agreed to reports diametrically oppOsite. Their lordships' committee resolved in favour of a relaxation of the act of 1844, while the committee of the House of Commons came to the resolution that no change in the system should take place. These conclusions were come to in both instances by narrow majorities, and that circumstance formed a good and sufficient reason why the subject should now be taken up by a Royal commission, which would be free from p arty spirit, which necessarily attached in some degree to Piarliamentary committees on this matter. He was rather unexpectedly for. tified in his notion that inquiry was necessary by the opiions of some of those who were supposed to be the strongest advocates of the present system. In a late debate in another place the shancellor of the Exchequer was reported to have said:- " I, nevertheless, fully admit that the opei-ation of the Bank Act of 1844 is a fit subject for investigation by a commoittee of this House when its proper time shall have arrived, and when the circumstances shall appear to be favourable for the prosecution of such an inquiry. I quite agree that there are many parts of the operation which require a complete investi, ation by a competent tribunal, and I shaillbe quite willing, when the proper time ars-ives, to assent to the a pp ointment of a committee on the subject." Sir C. v ood also said:- "I am far from saying that sich inquirv is undesirable." Hle was aware that those gentlemen guarded themselves agaistpledging themselves as to time, but they both admiitted that mquiry was desirable. He pressed this matter on their lordships' attention, because the system as at present constituted had been tried and had failed. The act of 1844 had not worked well, but had failed in preventing over-speculation, and had proved inefficient when the dangerarose. Since the passing of the act there hadbeea a commercial crisis, and greater fluctuations of interest than ever had been known before. He would not go into the subject of the country banks, or into the Scotch and Irish question; but would confine hiuself solely to the case of the Bank of England. By the act of 1844 the Bank of England was authorized to issue 14,000,0001. in notes, on the security! of the debt due to it by the State, -nd unrepresented by gold im their coffers. Every note beyond that amount must be represented by gold.. The Bank of England was likewise divided into a banking department and an issue department; andthus the goldwhich was in the issue department to answer the notes in circulation over the amount of the 14,000,0001. was not available for any of the requirements in the banking department. By another part of the act the directors of the Banck were empowered to take up a certain quantity of country notes when any of the country banks ceased to issue; and the amount of that circulation which had so ceased was nearly 500,0001. It was plainly intimated to the directors that they were to consider themselves merely as bankers; that, as such, they were to look to their own interest, without reference to the state of the nation. Accordingly, when gold became plentiful they lowered the interest in order to get their notes out to the public, and when gold became scarce they raised the rate of interest. EDuring the last l years 40 fluctuations of interesthadtaken place varying from 2 to 7, 8, and 9 per cent. ; whereas in previous years the fluctuations were few and trifling. The-e fluctuations appeared to be on the increase, for during the the last four years they had amounted to 18, and during the last year to S. The low rate of interest established in 1847 greatly encouraged speculation, and its resulb was to produce such a drain upon the Bank that at the end of the year the amount of gold left in it was considerably under 2,000,0001. The pressure became so great that the rate of interest w as raised to 7 and 8 per cent., and Mr. Samuel Gnmey stated, in his evidence, that he had been obliged to pay 9 per cent. for an advanoe of 200,0001.. and such was the panic that Mr. Horsley Palmer stated that if the Bank had attempted to relieve itself by as sale of Consols the price would have gone down to 60. But the directors; undeterred by the experience of 1847, when mnoney became plentiful in 1852 again reduced their interest to the ridiculously low rate of 2 per cent. -The same result followed, a drain of gold again took place, the Bank again raised its interest, and at the end of last year the country was again in difficultiesand numerous bankraptcies took place. According to the presentsystem he knew that it was abEolutely necessary to raise the rate of interest-in other words, " to put on the screw"-when gold became scarce. The Governor of the Bank, in h-is evidence before the committee of 1848, said, upon this subject:- "The means of gettmg back the gold is by makingnioney dear, and causing a fall generally in the price of commodities, which will bring back gold ' and, "'prices w111 fall in consequence of the increased value of money."1 The effect of "putting on the screwf' was not only to ruin- those houses wleich had been tottering, but also to depreciate the whole property of the countryandtofoster speculative circulation by forcing out thenotes of the Bank. 'he act of 1844 had falsified the predictions of its promoters in another point. The noble lord opposite (Lord Overstone), generally supposed to be its author, said, npon the question of note circulation keeping pace with the increase or decrease of gold,-. " The issues of the Bank of England will, under the provisions of that bill, benmade to conform strictly to the oluctuations ofthe bullion. Thus, it appears that contraction of the circulation in correspon-lenee with the decrease of the bullion is the only measure which can afford effectual security for stopping the drain of bullion." No doubt the amount of notes in circulation was regulated by the amount of gold in the Bank, but the expectation of the noble lord had not been fulfilled, because the note circulation was within a fraction the same in 1847, when there were 9,000,0001. of gold in the Bank, as in 1846, when there were 16,000,0001.; at the end of 1832 there was a note circulation of 22,000,0001. with 19,000,000!. of gold; at the end of 1853, a note circulation of 24,000,0001. with 15,000,0001. of gold.; in the early part of 1855 a circulation of 20,000,000!. with 18,000,0005. of gold;*and in October, 21,000,0001. with only 11,000,000!. of gold. He trusted he bad now made out a fair case for the propriety, if not the neceSsitY, of a searching investigation into this matter before a competent tribunal. He had brought forward no tseory, he had only stated undeniable facts. It could not be draputed that during the last UI years greater fluctuations had taken place and there had been greater over-speculation and greater monetary crises than had been ever known in modern times, and the greatest supporters of the act admitted that some inquiry into its operations was necessary It might be said, what is the use of makidng a change in the act of 1844 if you cannot substitute soiethin better? But there were many points in which the act might be improved, and he thought it would be a better plan to improve it than altogether to get rid of it. If the act were to be continued, he thought, m the first place, that the circulation ought to be relieved by enlarging the powers of the Bank of England, so as to enable it to issue 1l.-notes. He was as much impressed as any man with the necessity of providing for the convertibility of the bank-notes; but by preventing the Bank from issuing small as well as large notes' they forced into circulation a number of sovereigns which would otherwise remain in the Bank-, and enable it to issue a greater amount of notes on the security of its gold without increasing its liability. These ll.-notes ought to be issued upon the same footing as larger notes * they ought to be a legal tender, but convertible into gold.~~ 1825 the Bank was relieved from great difficulty by the issue of a number of these small notes, and many of their ldÃ¯Â¿Â½dships would remnember the statement of the late Lord Ashbua-ton, whozrecommended the issue, that if 2,000,000 old 14-notes -had not accidentally been ready he did not know what would have been the result. It had been said that many of these 1U.-notes would be forged, but he could not understand why they could be forged more easily than notes of a larger amount. In Scotland forgery had, he believed, been almost unknown for many years.. The Scotch not only preferred nots, but had a great distrust of gold. They knew that a 11.-note, however dirty, duly representedtheamoumt of 20s.; but that a sovereign might be light. There was no feeling of distrust in 1826 and 1828 of 1l.-notes, So far from that he could refer to the declaration of inisters of that day, who said that the people preferred notes to gold, and an act was passed in 1828, the 7th of George IV., by which Scotch notes were prohibited under a penalty from bein circulated across the border, these notes, although not a 1. gal tender, having found their way into Lancashire and Yorkshire. Another point in the present system might be advantageously changed without infrnging on the main principles of the aet-viz., the constitution of the Bank direction. The management of the Bank was intrusted to the governor, the deputy-governor, and 24 Bank directors, eight of whom were by tm-ns ineligible for one year. He thought it objectionable that eight directors should be turned out of office just as they began to know their business, and should be "sent to grass" for a year to forget it. He might also object to the rule by which matters of importance were decided by the mere majority of the directors. He thought there ought to be some sort of Government inspection and controL and he was borne out in this opinion by the evidence given by Mr. Glyn and Mr. Brown in 1848 before the House of Comamons. The Bank of France was conducted on that principle of Government control, and with excellent resuits. It had a governor and two sub-governors. These officers were nominated by the Crown and received large salaries. He would not quarrel with their raising the rate of interest when gold was scarce, because that was necessary; but he objected tothe unduly low rate of interest to which the Bank resorted when money was plentifuL The panic of 1847 was very much brought on by the reduction in the rate of interestin the previousyear to 2. and3 per cent. The Bank of England ought to be either a State Bank or separated from the State. If it were a State Bank, it ought to be under Government supervision, and ought to consult the interests of the country. He was incined to think, although he spoke with some doubt, that it mnight be desirable to ado,pt some Muinimuwm rate of interest. Previously to 1844 the variations in the rate of interest were very fev. Another improvement which could be effected by a mere stroke of the pen wis in raising the amount of notes which the Bank of England was authorized to issue over and above those that must be represented by gold. In 1844 it was supposed that 14,000,0001. were sufficient for the wants of the country, but this amount would hardly be sufficient now, considering how the country had in the interval increased in population and wealth, It would be a great relief if some step could be adopted, such as raising the note eirculation from 14,000,000!. to 18,000,0001. or 20,000,000., in order to nmeet the increased demands-,f the country. The main principles of the act of 1844 he disapproved-viz., the restrictive clauses, and the separation of the two departments of the Bank. Upon this latter subject he would quote the opinion expressed by Mr. Tooke at the conclusion of his pamphlet on the Bank Charter. Mr. Tooke said,- " at the greater or less liability to variation in the rate of interest constitutes, in the degree next only to the preservation of the convertibility of the paper and the solvency cf banks, the most important consideration in the regulation c f our banking system. That a total separation of the busir ess of issue from that of banking is calculated to produce treater and more abrupt transitions in the rate of interest nd in the state of credit than the (present) system of union of departments." No man, however bigottedan advocate of a metallic currency, would say that the Bank ought to be deprived of the power of issuing anynotes whatever that were not represented by gold. If England had been governed upon such principles for the last two eenturies she would now be a small thlrdrate State. There could be no doubt about the expediency of ssung notesthat were not actuallyrepresented by gold in the coffers of the Bank, and the only doubt was as to the limit. For himself, he objected to naming a particular amount of notes beyond which no issue should take place, because when that limit was reached distrust and discre&it began. Ie believed there would not have been half so severe a crisis in 1847 if the Bank had had the power of increasing the issue of notes upon the 9,000,0001. of gold which it then possessed. At a later period of great difficulty there was 12,500,0001. of gold in the Bank of England, which would have warranted a larger issue of notes, and would greatly have relieved the pressure. If the provisions of the act of 1844 regulated the proceedings of the Bank of France, instead of now meeting aIl its engagements, and having a stock of 8,500,0001. of gold in its coffers, the Bank of France would be 2,000,0001. mninus in its banking department. Within the last four years there had been only two changes in the rate of interest charged by the Bank of France, while within the same period there had been 18 changes in the rate of interest char-ed by the Bank of England. The late Lord Ashburton, in his evidence respecting the Bank of France, said,- "There has been at no time any suspension of its payments, or any material difficulties of any kind ; and it seems to have answered perfectly well the object for which that Bank, lie our own, was instituted-namely, as a bank to give proper facilities to the circulation and commerce of the country, and at the same time to be the bankers of the Government, and to give every proper andlegitimate facility to the operation of the Govermuent." Be would rather have inquiry by committee than no inquiry at all; but, as it was almost impossible to separate the subject from the influence of party feelig, he thought the appointment of a Royal commission would bethe preferable course. (Hear, hear.) He would not presume to name the members of the commission, but would humbly suggest that persons shonld be selected who were not pledged to any particular views on the question. In conclusion the noble earl moved, " That a humble address be presented to Her Mlajesty, praying that Her Majesty will issue a Royal commissionto inquire into the state of the currency of the united kingdonn." The Earl of HA2rXOWBY, who was very indistinctly heard, was' understood to say that it was the intention of the Government, as had been stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the other house, to appoint a committee to inquire into the operation of the Bank Act of 1844 before any revision was attempted in the present arrangements. He admitted that there were some stubjects more fitted to be inquired into by commissions than committees, but he considered this was an inquiry peculiarly belonging tothe Houses of Parliament to undertake. He did not think it desirable to enter into any discussion of the points Fuggested by the noble earl, but would merely say inquiry should be made before notice was given to the Bank to ter. minate the operation of the act of 1844. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, it was usual to give rotice of motions of such importance as this, but the J otice given by the noble earl conveyed the impression shat no motion would be made. Thie Earl of EGI&NTOUN said, he had hoped, and still hoped, that his motion would extract a more satisfactory answer from the Government than had been given by the Loble earL The Earl of HARROWBY said, the only new point raised by the noble earl was his preference for a commission instead of a committee. He thought a commission could s nly add to the invesigation, and not supersede inquiry by ommittees of both Houses. The Earl of DERBY said, a more important question than the formh of the inquiry was what were the intentions Cf the Government? All that the Government had said as, that inquiry was very desirable at the proper time and in the pro,per mode. He begged to ask, when was the pro-. pe,hear.) His noble friend (the Eal of ave as a reason why the present was the proper time that the~ Bank was open to notice from the Government at any period, and the charter, therefore, con tinued only from year -t5- year. It was very desirble that the conditions of any new -charter should- be well eon- ddered. The C-overmment aasigned the most extraordinary 1 Of all zeasons for not proceeding with inquiry-that they. did not intend to give the Bank notice in the course i of. the present year. Surely inquiry, either by a com- ssion or X committee, ought to precede the giving of notice to determine the present charter. (lear, hear.) .Altbough his noble friend did not intend to presslis aotion, he {Lord Derby) thought that he had a riht to espeot~ from the Government X more distinct declaration of: their opinion as to the merits ofthe act of 184, and maore definite information as to tbe course -which they intended to j pursue with regard to institutng an inquiry into its operation, in order that the country might deliberately and fully consider and judge of the question before the Government proceeded to negotiate with the Ban'.. (Eear, hear.) - Tshe Duke of .&GYLL said that the noble lord had somewhat misrepresented the answer given in the other house by his right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Excheguer, and repeated in that house by his noble friend behmnd him (Lord Harrowby). In the House of Commons the Chancellor of the Eschequer distinctly announced that the Government had no intention of making any change in the Bank CharterAct of 1S44, but thatif anyhon. member of that :Eouse was extremely anxious for an inquiryinto the subject the Government would throw no impediment in its way. The right hon. gentleman did not intuinate that he thought ann inquiry desirable. He merely said that if any hon. member of that House or any noble lord moved the appointmnent of a committee upon this subject, the Government would not oppose the. inquiry. The proposal of the noble earl opposite was, however, of a very different character, because if the Government appointed a commission it would be a distinct intimation to the country that they were dissatisfied with the lawv, and attributed to it evils which they desired to remedy. The Government had arrived at no such opinion, and they were therefore not prepared to recommend the Crown to issue a Royal commission upon this subject. The Earl of DERBY said that, unless he had entirely misunderstood what fell from his noble friend (Lord Harrowby), he began by admitting that inquiry, at a proper time and in a proper mode, was desirable. The Duke of ARGYL-At the proper time. The Earl of DERBY.-What did the noble duke meani If he was to taLe him to be the exponent of the Ministry, the Government had made up their minds that an inquiry was not necessary, because they had no intention of altering the charter. Then, what were they going to do? Were they prepared to renew the Bank Charter as it stood 7 Did they think it was desirable that that charter should go on from year to year, with a perpetual liability to cbe put an end to at the expiration of 12 months 9 If this were the intention of the Government, it seemed to him very like an intention to tide over a difficult question with which they did not knoiv how to deal, and to throw upon others a responsibility which ought to fall upon themselves. (Hear, hear.) The Duke of A2RGYLL said that it was the intention of the Government to tide over a difficult question at a time most unsuited for dealing with it. Earl GREY said that, if there were to be fn inquiry he did not see how there could be any time which bould he better for that inquiry than the present. By the act of 1844 there was a time fixed before which the Bank Charter could not be revoked, and beyond that period the act gave to the Bank an indefinite tenure of its privilege, terminable afterthe giving of a certain notice. (Rear, hear.) The fixed period was now passed, and we could never get any nearer to the actual terminationof the Bankprivilegesuntilthe notice had been given. He couldhaveunderstood the Government saying that the act of 184 had worked perfectly, and that, therefore, no inquiry was necessary; or that that measure was an incomplete one andrequLired amendment; that, therefore, they proposed to inquire, and that the earlier the inquiry was commenced the better. Although he differed fromthe noble earl opposite (the Earl of Eglintoun) as to the faults which ho attributed to the act of1S4, he was readyto admit that that act was imperfect, because it did not carry to their full extent the principles on which it was founded, and, therefore, he believed that aninquiryinto its operation would be a very proper measure. (Hear, hear.) He was, however, quite at a IOSS to understand the line nowr taken by Her Majesty's Government. (Hear, hear.) They said that inquiry was desirable at aproper time and in a proper manner, hut h could not conceive how ther could be a bettsr time than the present, and he thought there was much soundness in the arguments used by the noble esri opposite (the Earl of Eglitoun) as to the advantages possessed by an inquiry by a Royal commission over oneby a commnittee. lord RAVEINSWORTH said that this subject had ex;cited much attention in the country, and he thought the Government might have given some more deiimte intimation of the course which thev intended to pursuewith regard to it. The motion was then withdrawn. OUT-PENSIONTERS (GREENWICH ARD CHELSEA) BILL. This bill was read a third time and passed. AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS BILL. On the report of the amendments to thisbill, The Earl of DER;BY suggested that, as the occupants of farms frequentlychangedon Lady-day,the date on which the books containing their names should be annually made uD should be altered from the 1st of February to the 1st of MWay. Lord STAMLEY of ALDERLEY expressed a doubt whether this date would allowtime for the sufficiently early distribution of the forms of returns; but promised to consider the suggestion of the noble earl. The Earl of DERBY thought that three months would be sufficient timefor the preparation and distribution of forms. He would not suggest the 1st of April as the date to which the books should be made up. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEYproposedan amendment, the effect of which was to render the non-filling -up of the returns punishable by three months' imprisonment, but, it being opposed by the Earls of 'DERY, ExnDNwicKE, and MAaIrESnuRY, it was ultimately withdrawn. The report, with amendments, was then agreed to. Their lordships adjourned at five minutes before 7 o'clock.

THE PEACE. CUSTOM-HOUSE EEGULATIONS. Mr. THORNELY asked the Secretaiy of ihe Treasury whether, a treaty of peace having been signed at Paris, the bonds required to be given at the Custom-houses on the exportation of iroa andof certaia other manufactured articles might not now he dispeased with, aadthe boads already issued cancelled ? Mr. WILSON observed, in repiy, that, though the signature of a treaiy of peace did not, strictly speaking, put an end to a state of war-such a proceeding being simply an undertaking that the war should conclude as soon as the treaty was ratified-the Government could aot perceive that any useful object would be attained by continuing the bonds on certaia articles of manufacture, iacluding more particularly pieces of machinery and all descriptions of iron works. To-morrow, therefore, ihey should be prepared to issue to the Commissioners of Customs ordersthat would allow such matters to be shipped without bonds for the future. On gunpowder, **ims, and all kinds of ammuaitioa bondwould for the present coatinue to he exacted, but it-was to be hoped that in the coarse of a few days the restrictioa would be abolished even in the case of these articles. (Hear, hear.) It was not intended to <*ncel the out-lying boads, but rather to let them lapse in the usual manner. ROAD THROUGH QUEENS PARK, EDINBURGH. In reply to a question from Mr. Black,Sir B. HAT.L said,- he proposed to lay on the tahle tH the correspoadence that iad taken place between the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and others and himself in relation to the road through Queen's Park to Holyrood. The correspondence would be accoiapaniedbyaplan and section of the road; and, if it should afterwards be the wish of the Scottish members that he should proceed with the vote foJ"; this work, he would be quite ready to do so. \ CHEISEA-BBLDGE, &c " In answerto* question from Mr, Wn__KS02r,- -, SirB.

CLOTHING, &c., OF TBTB; -mtt.ttta Mr. HUME asked the Uader-Secretaiy for Wai-, whetiier it was true that an order had been givea to suspend the issue of clothing to the militia regiments of _re_ind - and in the event of such being the case, whether that step had reference to the force being disbanded, or ia way rea_e«_: upon the ratification of peace* ^^ Mr. PEEL said, that orders had beea sent to the commanding officers of the militia regiments generally- and not merely to those statipaed in Irelaad-directing ihem to suspend the issue of the clothing to the mea; but oa further consideration a different decision was come to, and the i6sue of the clothing was authorized in the usual manner. The militia haviag been embodied in consequence of ihe breaking out of the war, aow that peace had returned ihey would of course be disembodied. Colonel DUNNE asked, whether the hon. genUeman (Mr. Peel) was awAre of the clothing haviDg ever been sent to those regiments 1 Mr. PEEL replied in the -ffirmative. REVIEWS IN THE CRIMEA ON "SUNDAYS. Captaia STUART asked the Uader-Secretary for "War, whether the attentioa of the War-office had been called io the fact of there having beea large reviews of the British army in the Crimea on Sundays, by which the troops hsd been prevented from attending Divine worship and enjoyinK a day's rest. " Sir- PEEL said that reviews appeared to have been held on. two Sundays-one in Februaiy, and another in March. He was aot aware of the reason which induced General Codringtoa to order them on Sunday. The holding of parades on that day, as * general rule, would aot be encouraged by the Government POREIGN TROOPS. Mr, OTWAY asked the Uader-Secretary for War what was the aumber of the foreign troops atpreseatia the pay of this country, and also what were the future intentions of the Government with regard to those troops ? Mr. PEEL said, the aumber of foreign troops in the pay of this countiy was between 30,000 and 40,000. Xhe Turkish Contingent, he imagined, would he faaasferred to the Turkish Government. Nodecisioahad yet beea come to respecting the disposal of ihe other foreiga legioas. THOROUGHFARES THROUGH ST. JAMES'S PARK. In reply to a question from Mr. HuTCHINGS, SirB. HALL stated, that he would lay the estimates for carrying out theproposed works in connexion with this subject before the House in a few days, when he would also give further explanation of the course intended to be pursued. FISHERY COMMISSION (TSELANX)). In answer to a question from Mr. M'Mahos', Mr. HORSMAN said ihat in no instance since the year 1S42, the date of the passing of the act in relation to this question, had the Fishery Coinmissioners ever made their report before the end of March. The report for the past year was not yet prepared, tsut it would probably he ready to be laid on the table of the house in the course of the next month. PROSECUTIONS FOR ADULTERATION (EXCISE). Onthe motion of Mr. Peacocke, A return was ordered of the number of prosecutions for adulteration jnstituted hy the Excise during the years 1S53, 1854, and 1S55, stating the number of cases in which they ohtained convictions,andalso the number of cases in which the penalties imposed wereremitted. SUPPLY.-B_*__"_"tING IN SCOTLAND. Oa the order of the day for going iato Committee of Supply, Mr. COWAN brought uader the aotice of the House the evils atteading the system pursued ia Scotland of billeting soldiers of the line and of the militia upon private families. Thehon. gentleman complained that the sum of Hd, a- night,which was allowed by the War-office for the board of soldiers, was not sufficient io recompense the very poorest class upon whom they were billeted, while the better class of householders were subjected to the greatest annoyance from the coarse language aad habits of some of the men whose preseace they were compelled to tolerate in their dwellings. The hon. gentleman entered iato some details to show the oppressive aature of the system, aad he stated that, as exemptions were frequently granted, the burden of maintaining the military was in some places thrown upon a small minority of tho inhabitants. If the system had the effect of making the soldiers fight pro oris ctfocis more stoutly than before he would not say oae word against it; but he coateaded that it was destructive of their comfort and injurious to their discipline. Another reason why a change should be made was, that the blame of the existing practice was laid on the shoulders of the lordslieutenant of counties and cities, although they were not responsible for it in the-smallest degree. Not maay days ago the House voted 1,750,000?. for barracks, bnt aot a siagie farthing of that sum was allocated to Scotland. Ihe hon. member concluded by moving " thafc, ia the opiaion of this House, the practice of billeting soldiers of ihe -millHu. aad of the line in Scotland upon private families is injurious to thecomfort and discipline of themen,as well as oppressive to the people; and that it is the duty of the Government to take means permanently to abolish the grievance." Sir A AGNEW seconded the motion. He stated that the regimeat of Galloway Rifles, ever since its embodiment in the beginning of 1855, had been imposed as a burden upon the small town of Newton-Stewart, with a population not much exceeding 2,000. He thought that some compensation was due to the inhabitants. Sir. BAXTER said, that one of the burghs which he represented was now paying at the rate of 600/. a-year for ihe quartering of only the depot of the Forfar and Kincardineshire Artillery. Before the removal of the principal portion of the regiment to Fort George, the inhabitants paid a tax much greater in amount. Siace peace had been concluded the Govermnent might not feel disposed to continue tho militia; bat, if they should, some otherplan must be devised for housing the men. _ The present system was utterly destructive of all militaiy discipline, aad iafiicted a burden too grievous to be borne upon a small section of the community, for purposes which were national. He did not' think that the rural population of Scotland wonld longer submit to have the sanctity of their homes violated by men who were often chosen from the dregs of society, when ao necessity could be shown for it and when a remedy might easily be adopted. Mr. PEEL said, that the conclusion of peace had put an end to all the disagreable consequences of the system to which the motion refened; and, if the practice of billeting had never existed to a greater extent than at the present moment, he was not awaro that any complaint would have heen made by the people of Scotland. He must_ remind the JHouse that the embodying of the militia had been rendered necessary by the war, and the Government had eadeavoured to relieve the pressure of the billeting system hy the formation of large camps. Now, as peace was_ concluded, the pressure of billeting would in all probability before long cease to have any practical effect, because, although it did not follow as a necessary conquence of _ the termination of the war that the militia would be disembodied, still he apprehended that, without doubt, the militia would not continue embodied when the circumstances of the couatiy rendered that embodiment unnecessary. _ He ought to add that the Government had made great exertions io reduce the amount of grievance inflicted by this system, and he believed that at present, although the oitoto of Scotland was about 10,000 men, not moro than 2,000 were billeted upon ihe people of that country, and it appeared impossible that so small a number dispersed over the whole of Scotland conld produce aay veiy great pressure. As to the difference that in Scotland troons were liable to be billeted upon householders generally, while in England they wero liable to be billeted oa oae C-ss only, that was to be attributed to an arrangement made at the union of the two countries. The motion of the hoa. geatiemaa applied to the regular forces of the country as well as to the militia, but the fact was that although, generally speaking, there was barrack accommodation sufficieat for all the troops, still ihose barracks were not, as in Ireland, scattered throughout ihe couatry, aad troops oa the move or recruiting parties required to have quarters provided forthem. He thought, therefore, that, as regarded the regular forces, Govemment could aot dispense with the power of issuing billets, nor could they in the case of the militia, because it was out of the question that Governnient should erect permanent barracks in every couaty, ia order to provide for any contingency which might render it necessary to embody tho militia. In the abstract, he considered the Scotch system more jnst than the English, and he thought that before the hom gentleman wishedto alter it, he ought to show that if billeting were restricted to one class, Government would still'have the means of carrying oa the system. Por these reasons he felt himself bound to resist the motion. _ Sir J. FERGUSSON said, that a great numberof petitions had bcen preseated to that House, complaining of the inconvenience resulting from the present system, and last year the noble lord at the head of the Government had givea reason for hoping that ia time some steps would be takea to remedy that grievance. Scotch members wera obliged to press this subject aow, although the war was at a close, ia order to prevent Scotland, if, unfortuaately, any future war should takeplace, from being placed again in the same unfortunate position as she was in at present. As to the system of billeting in Scotland having beca established in accordance with the Act of Union, he must rcmiad- tha House that at that time Scotland was in a very disturbed state, and a system noi by any means advantageous aow might have been then esseatially necessary. He trusted that the hoa. member for Ediaburgh would not withdraw his motion-unless the Govemment gave a distinct pledge that, when the finances of the countiy allowed of it, they would take some steps for establishing barracks sufficient for housing the whole militia force, for it should be remembered that even if the militia were disembodied they were still liable to be called out for 28 days every year. Mr. EWART had hoped that, as the Government- had had ample time to consider the subject, they would h»vs been prepared to suggest a remedy. -AUowing ihis to be a questioa of justice as well as a question of com« mon sense, he felt sure he should not appeal in vain to the aoble lord for the abolition of the practice. What was chiefly complained of was that there was one law for England aad Ireland, »nd another law for Scotland. Tha poorest person ia Scotland was liable to have soldiers forced njoon hun and hin family, eoatrarv to aH principles of -_.*. -tanty, while no such thing existed in England or in Ireland. He admitted that the anny should be prepared ina time «£

SURGEONS' CEB?TIPICATES FOR FACTORY CHILDRIEN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIlES. Sir,-As Colonel Wilson Patten has introduced into ParEiament a bill to amend the defects of the Factory Act with reference to the securely fencing of gearing and shafting, it offers a most favourable opportunity to the millowners of the united kingdom of amending the law as it now exists in requiring a surgeon's certificate of the age of every child or young person working in factories. It always has appeared to me a strange inconsistency that after the country has paid about 2,000,0001. for an efficient registration, every inillowner, in order to ascertain the ages of the young persons he employs, is not allowed to obtain a certificate of birth, and thus put the matter beyond doubt ; but he must be put to the weekly, or at most fortnightly, expense of a surgeon attending his works, when, like a horse-jockey, the surgeon gravely asks the child to open its mouth, and then exhibits his skiU in dentology by divining its exact age. As the Registration Act has now been in operation since 1837there can beno reason why this system Bhouldbe longer continued, except as a piece of patronage for the inspectors, who have the gift of these appointments, and as a sort of black mail levied upon the miUowners, to remind them that they live in a country where every conceivable mode of creating place and patronage is adopted. If the object of the law is to prevent children from being employed before a proper age, and thus that their health and strength may not be deteriorated, Parliament has provided in the Registration Act an excellent means of obtaining this, and not, as is now too often the case, children It years of age certified at 13, because they have she strength and appearance of children much older, thus preventing them from obtaining that education and physical development they would otherwise acquire. The practical result is an evasion of the law, and I affirm that while the millowners, as a bod, are anxious to carry out the law in its integrity, they do not wish topay for a machinery which is altogether unnecessary. The inspectors in their annual reports complain " that they have had to admonish certifying surgeons for having executed their duties without suSficient caution-that children not 12 years of agae have been certified as 13 ;" " that the children, w ho well know their age, are tutored how to behave before the surgeon, and are led to believe that they may gain more by deceit than by the utterance of truth;," " that parents connive at the illegal employment of their children, who ought instead to be kept at school for the full period required by law, and that a child for whom one certifying surgeon has refused to grant a certificate may, on off'ering himself at a neighbeuring mill, be there authorized to work for full time upon the authonty of a colleazuee" There could not be stronger condemnation than this ofthe system of guess-work at present in operation, when the truth itself could be at once obtained by a simple extract from the register, provided and paid for by the people. There would still be ample check, through the inspectors, that a child incapacitated by physical debility should not be employed. They have now power to annul any certificates of age under such circumstances, and, as this is a very rare occurrence, the inspectors mighthave power, if they thought proer,to allina medical man to advise with before annuUing such certificate.. Wa The number of mill-occupiers liable to the provisions of the Factory Act in the united kingdom is about 8,000, and if we take only5i as their indvidual payment, here is c0,000w. per annum extracted from their pockets for misdoing a thing already done, whereas now every child may obtain a certificate of real afe, which would serve na a passport for employment throngh life, instead of having to 'btain a new surgeon's certficate on every change of employment. Isam satisfied it only requires the attention of our representatives and Government to be called to this matter to secure a remedy, and my apology for trespassing upon your space r the present favourable opportunity. I am. Sir, yours very respectfully. GEORGE ROBIhNSON niong's-bridge, nenr Huddersfield, April 5.

LONDON, TUESDAY, APBIL 8, I1. In the House of Lords yesterday, The Earl of HARDwicXy called attention to the' state of postal communication between England and the Australian colonies, and asked if there was any objection to lay on the table the memorial from the colonies on the subject.. The Duke of AxGoLu admitted the necessity of re-establishing the communication between this country and Australia; tenders for that purpose were now under the consideration of the Govemnment; but before any route was adopted there muxt be a general assent of the colonies to the plan, as they were to bear a large share of the expQene. There wouid be no objection to the productionofthe memoriaL. The Earl of Eoewcroui, in directing the notioe of the Government to the expediency of iSsuing Royal Commisson to inquire into the laws regulating. the currency of the-United Kingdom, deucribed the regulationsand,Worling of the present Bank Act,: - Iand tatedthat he objected to the shortnees of the term for which the directorsheld office, and to the deciions of the body whiclx affected the affairs of the whole country being made by a mere majority of them; he thought there ought to be a Government control, -which worlked well in the Bank of France; He approved the princi$?le of the act of 18"4, particularly the separation of the two depart. ments of the Bank; he approved also an issue of notes besides the portion issued on bulion; but ob. lected to fixing a limit beyond which nothing could be done; he advocated an issue of 11.-notes. The Earl of HRRowBY repeated the statement made by the CRsxCr.atol, of the Exciu in the Bouse of Commons, that the Goverunment did not contemplate any change in the Ban3k A ct; but that if any noble lord pressed for an inquiry into it the Governmnent would not throw any obstacle in the way. Before any renewal of the powers of the Bank was given it would, of course, be necessary to in. stitte an iry The Earl of EGoanTour had hoped for a more satisfactory answer. The Earl of DEBBY wished to know what was the intention of the Government with regard to any inquiry at alL When was the proper time, and what was to be the mode t The Duke of AaGxur.said if a Royal CommiWsion were issued it would imply that the Government was dissatisfied with the present state of things. The Government had arrived at no such conclusion. The Earl of DERsr considered this was but adimitting that the Government wished to tide over a difficult question. The Duke of AmGYLL allowed that this was the case, the present time, just at the conclusion of a war, being of itself a great difficulty. Earl GREY thought this was the proper time if there was to be any inquiry. They had passed the period at which the charter of the Bankl expired, and would never get any nearer the period at which the final notice could be given. He did not agree with the Earl of EGLiNro's objections tothe BanLAct of 1844; but he still thought it an imperfect measure, into which an inquiry was necessary. The subject then dropped. The report of the amendments to the Agricultural StatisticsBill was reaeivedn aud the House adjourned. I In the House of Comnmons, on the order for going into Committee of Supply, Air. CowAN moved a resolution, that the practice of billeting soldiers in Scotland upon private families is injurious to the comfort and discipline of the men, as well as oppressive to the people, and that it is the duty of the Government to take means to abolish the grievance. RIe contended that this practice, if not illegal, was entirely unconstitutional, and observed that the inliction was the more odious because it was believed to be exercised in an arbitrary and partial manner. The motion was seconded by Sir A. AGEW. After a few words fron Mr. BAXTR in support of the motion, Mr. F. PEE$ observed that the ternination of the war would put an end to the grievance conmplained of. The pressure, which had been undoubted, arose, he said, in consequenca of the Militia having been embodied, the Government being under the necessity of placing the embodied Militia in the towns of the respective counties during the time arangements were making for removing them but of billet. The Militia, which was a county force, would be of no value if the Government could not retain the poweer of placing the men in billet when requisite. The distinction between the English and the Scotch Aystems of billeting arose from the Act of Union, and, although the Scotch sstem was attended with great inconvenience, he was not sure that it was not more equitable than that of England. He opposed the motion. Sir J. FERGuSSOx, 'Mr. EwAnT, and 3Ir. JonIN MrGRsGoR having spoken in support of it, tfr. ERirc1 cautioned the Rouse against encouraging complaints o, these little grievances until informed by the Governmnent on what principle the whole system of lodging our military force was to be permanently established.9 Lord PA:mm:sToN said he was ready to admit that it was undesirable, both with regard to the discipline of the troops and the feelings of morality on the part of the community, that soldiers should be quartered otherwise than in barracks or camps; but barracks could not be erected for the wants of the service without great expense and much consideration as to the localities. At the same time it was desirable, in peace as wel as in war, that barrack-accommodation shouldbe extended in England, Ireland, and Scotland. The grievance complained of was of long standing, and the system could not be altered without analteration of the Miutiny Act, which could not tak-e place before next year. It was, he assured the House, the earnest desire of the Government to diminish the grievance as much as possible; and, if the matter were left in their hands, they would feel it their duty to consider what arrangements could be made to remedy a grievanCe 'which they did not deny. The resolution was supportedby MIr. DuaxcA-, Mr. BLAcxBumN, Mr. LAIxG, Air. COxArouD, Mr. SrooxEs, and Mr. ArxxrN-D3mHAsTIx, and opposed by the LoRDADVOCATE, Lord EBRUMTohN and Sir G. GEEY, who hoped the House would not adopt a hasty resolution. Tne CHsAcELLon of the ExcHEQuER said the House must see that the question resolveditselfinto one of finance. The inconvenience of the system of billeting was admitted, andthe questionwas whether the Rouse was prepared to talke the only efficient means of removing it, byan additionalvote in Committee of Supply for the erection of permanent barracks or temporary quarters. Re trusted, after the assurance given by Lord PAIMnxsroN, that the House would not agree to an abstract resolution. 3fr. DIsit r.r observed that the resolution, although an abstract one, would not be barren of results. It did not bind the Government to anything but what was their duty-namely, to devise a remedy for an admitted grievance. After some further discumsion, in the course of -which Lord PAr=xxnsrox repeated that the Government were ready to consider what measures could be adopted for providing accommodation for the troops that would relieve householders in Scotland from 'this grievance, the Rouse divided, when the resolu- tion was carried (against the Goverment) by 139 to 116. Lord PALissTorx moved that the House do immediately resolve itself into a Committee of Supply, which was agreed to,after a few sarcastic remarks by M{r. D1iSxuR, upon the lesson which the Government had just received. The House accordingly, in conimittee, resumed the consideration of the Civil Service Estimates, and various votes were agreed to, after discussion. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to. The Draug,hts on Bankers Bill, and the Factories Bill were committed pro formt2. The Public Works Bill and the Public Works (Treland) Bill passed through committee. Lord ELcno moved for leave to bring in a bill to amend the laws relating to the medical profession, describing its principal features. Leave was given, after some remarks by Mr. CRAUFUrD and M1r. COWPER. MIr. LowE obtained leave to bring in a bilM to amend the law of partnership. The Rouse adjourned at 25 minutes to 2 o'clock.
It is but natural that those evils in the state of Italy to which we have called attention should interest the Italian Power which has not long ceased to suffer from many of them. The King of SAnu)TiA, before he entered on a war with Rusia, had fought a long battle with foes nearer home. The domination of Austria and the privileges of the priesthood were clearly seen to be the chief impedimenta to prosperity both in Piedmont and the States of the peninsula. By a course of policy both bold and cautious the Sardinian statesmen freed their country fom these obstales. They have given their Sovereign the right to speak in the :name of the whole Italia= rae, and ha.e inured him allies
Everybody has long said that we made a thousand mistakes, not only in this war, nor in the Revolutionary War, nor in any war, but in the last great peace. That Englishmen should make blunders when they are hurried is part of their nature. ATEISTA? the UNREADY is the type of our race, and the dull Saxon element has in this iustance prevailed over Norman fire and alacrity. No country ever made such oversights, no mere scholar or stargazer was ever so blind to the duties of everyday life, as England to the work it had to do forty years ago. There was the Great Du-E, an enterprising warrior, an exigent commander, and an unsparing critic, to tell it what ought to be done. It had to keep up an army, and not merely a number of regiments, to maintain an artillery, a commissariat, a transport service, and a great deal more. It had to teach the art of war on the scale of war, a thing only to be done with encampments, barracls, and large areas set apart for the purpose, as in every other country of Europe. We do not encounter swords with ploughshares, nor muskets with bows and arrows. We must fight with equal weapons, and train our soldiers as the French, Austrians, and Russians train theirs. All this we had learnt by sad experience in the war that ended in 1815, and then was the time to apply these lessons. We did not. Retrenchment was the order of the day. Government was unpopular. A great triumph had been gained over revolutionary and liberal principles, and it 'was thought the sum of statesmanship to defend every abuse and resist every innovation. In this petty warfare Parliament forgot the duty of putting the national defences in such a state as I not again to be taken by surprise. Scarce an error detected and heavily paid for in the Revolutionary War but survived uncorrected to the last. The Crimea is only the Peninsula over again, and worse. But we are now again as we were in 1815, returning with a large army, and much painful experience, to peace, which comes sooner upon us than 'we expected, and almost than we desired. What, then, is now to be done? Shall we sit down and let things take their course again, trusting to the chapter of accidents to give us some 'warning of future danger, and then help us out of our difficulties ? It is true we are not doing so at this moment, for thousands of shipwrights are working night and day to get ready the gunboats and vessels of every kind that are to figure in the review of the 16th. But what are we doing for any future wars that may menace us ? On a very indirect issue a part of this great question came before the House of Commons last night, and the House decided most patriotically against Government, though much against its economical tendencies. It decided against the practice of billeting soldiers in Scotland upon private families, and consequentlyinfavour of amore regular and more costly provision for them. Of the custom itself we need scarcely speak. Nobody can stand up for it who is not prepared to take a dozen Militiamen into hlis house to-morrow, and, as nobody on this side the Twveed is likely to answer that challenge, we cainot be surprised at the prejudice against such inflictions in the north. But if it follows as a natural consequence from the vote of last night that barracks are to be built at a great cost for tho militia, it equally follows from other considerations that these barracks must not be mere police-stations scattered over the country. If barracks for 30,000 men are to be constructed for Scotland they ought to be in the form of two or three camps, where the army as 'well as the militia may learn not merely drill, but manceuvring; where field officers may acquire better claims to command than seniority; and where the Staff may learn to provide for the numerous wants of an army more conveniently and effectuaUy than they can gain such knowledge in the presence of an enemy 3,000 miles off. The Scotch members have done their country no little service by mustering to do away with a practice as demoralizing to the soldier as it must be annoying to his reluctant host; but they must carry their patriotism a little further if they 'wish it to be respectable. They must not make interest for barracks here and barracks there, wherever a neighbourhood is to be improved or a property protected. Neither the army nor the militia is for such purposes. They are for the protection of the country and its rights against its external foes, and they 'will never be equal to their work unless they learn it on a scale somewhat corresponding to that of actual war. Lord CHEsrxnmD said that if a man wanted to behave well before the world, and on great occasions, he ought to do so always, at home, in his family, and even by himself; otherwise he would have to make efforts when it became necessary to do things without effort. If we have troops at all, they ought to be always at their -work on such a scale that when the actual occasion comes, as it must soon or late, they will only have to do what they have been doing every day. This, of course, will involve some further changes. The militia is at present a county force, but the days are long past 'vhen it was wanted for the protection of its county, and railroads have made it a matter of -very small concern where it assembles, so as it has not to go more than a couple of hundred miles from home. The conveyance of a regiment 600 strong a hundred miles need not cost more than 2001. or 3001., vwhich is a trifle compared with the losses we are sure to suffer wvhen a regiment goes into battle w%ithout ever having seen, we will not say a foe, which is not easily procured, but a friend,--when, in fact, it has never co-operated with another regiment before. Lord P.VuIsmsToN observed verytruly,therefore, last night that Mr. CowAN's resolution could not be entered upon without much consideration as to the localities. With a little arrangement the same barracks might be occupied by different bodies of militia in succession; and of course the situation ought to be chosen with a view to the general convenience. Anyfhing is better than mere police barracks for the protection of Irish landlords and English and Scotch manufacturers. As to the expense, when we reckon the millions thrown away on union workhouses, now happily never more than half filled, and the millions lavished in all sorts of folly, we are sure Parliament will not grudge the money for lodging the defenders of their country. It has often, indeed, been suggested that the union workhouses themselves would make capital barracks. Doubtless they would with a little alteration, and the use would give them a charm they cannot now be said to possess. But this is not a question to occtupy us now. Parliament has to set to w.rork at once to keep its army together, in good condition, well fed, well clothed, well housed, well armed, well trained, and, above ali, well commanded. We have got safe out of this war, and have at least the credit of ending it with a noble army in the field,-an army which has suggested even to the Amaericans the wisdom of maLing a little preparation before they carry their threats into practice. We have to keep that army in efficiency, if not in full numbers, and, should it suffer any decay, should it crumble into regiments, should it disappear in country quarters and colonial stations, and have Ino agFre,g,ate existence exQevt in the monthly' list showing whereabouts in the world each uLundredth part of the army happens to be buried, we are sure that the Govermnent of this country will be held resiponsibDle for the calamities cerWn to fall on us in the next great war.
Lord LurcA is very indignant against the Crimean Commi3sioners for daring to call his conduct in question. That is natural enough, but it might have been wiser to abstain from rhetoric until he had proved his case. When he talks of the malignity of Sir Jo r M`WNxur and Colonel TuLLoCH he will find it not a little difficult to persuade any rational being that these two gentlemen when they landed in the Crimea were actuated by any hostile feeling towards him. They made inquiries; they took evidence. The questions put and answers returned, togother with the names and military rank of the witnesses, are annexeed to the Report, and upon them the Report is founded. Among other points adverted to by the Commissioners is that of the period at which the hutting of the cavalry commenced. They state that in no case was this operation begun earlier than the end of January or the beginning of February, and that it was not completed before the middle of March, at which period the severity of the weather had abated, and the measure was of little use. Now, we find at page 75 of the Report of the Crimean Commission of Inquiry that Colonel HODGE, who was in command of the Heavy Cavalry Brigade at the time of his examination, speaks thus,-" The first lot of " horses was got under cover, I think, about the " end of January." Colonel DAnBY GRnETHiS, commanding the Scots Grays, got some of his hoises under shelter at an earlier period in the month, having at his own expense employed five French soldiers to erect the covering. It is this officer who stated to the Commissioners that so early as the middle of November he was afraid that his horses would suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and that heavy losses would occur unless something were done to protect them. The evidence of Colonel GRiEriTns is so precise and of so much importance that we will here reproduce it in. his own words *- " I stated toLord Lucan, that if I could hold out any en. couragement to my men to the effect that they were to remain for any length of time in the camp they then occupied, I could get them to erect some sort of covering to save the horses, when his Lordship threatened to place me under arrest for presuming to suggest such a thing. This occurred in the presence of Colonel Hodge, Lord William Paulet, and others. If that suggestion had been acted on, I have no doubt I should have saved many of the horses -which were lost." Colonel DOHERTY, commanding the 13th Light Dragoons, in the course of his evidence states, "We Cc commenced hutting the horses on the 26th of "January, andcompleted it on the 22dof February." Now, really it is a little hard to see how Sir JoHN M'rNEL, and Colonel TuLtocn, with such evidence before them, could report upon the hutting of the horses otherwise than they did. We see no occasion for fastening upon them the imputation of malignity. On the contrary, under all the circumstances, their memorandum upon this point is characterized by extreme forbearance and moderation. Colonels HODGE, GiuiaITHs, and DonEB.TY may be right, or they may be wrong, but there at least is their evidence, and upon this the Commissioners were bound to report. We have adverted more particularly to the evidence of these officers because it is to this point of the hutting of the horses that Lord LuCAN addressed himself in the course of his explanations before the Chelsea Board yesterday. From the passages we have quoted it follows that the necessity of hutting the horses had occurred to the Colonels in command of regiments so early as the middle of November, but was then-repudiated by Lord LucA. The Earl objects to a comparison between the losses incurred by the Commissariat and the losses of the cavalry. He does so becausethe cavalry lost their horses when they were exposed to all the inclemency of the weather, and because they were so exposed duing the wettest months of the whole campaign. But why was such exposure incurred? What renders the argument of Lord LUCAN still more whimsical is, that he winds up this portion of his defence by taking credit for the manner in which he preserved a consignment of 270 mules between January 20th and February 13th. He says that his efforts were crowned with far greater success than the efforts of the Commissariat officers. Why could not the same intelligence which preserved the mules preserve the horses? The simple truth is, that upon his own showing Lord Luc.AuN did not know how to set about the construction of huts. " The "construction of stabling of that sort was per"fectly novel, to myself, and I may say that " there was not an individual belonging to the "cavalry who had ever seen such horse-stabling." Such was Lord LucAX's statement, as made yesterday to the Military Board at Chelsea. It does not give the reader any very high idea either of his capacity for comniand, or of the manner in which our cavalry are trained for the contingencies of service in the field. What we should have wished to see provedc by Lord LuCAN would have been, that by the middle of November, at latest, he had done his utmost to persuade the General-in-Chief to leave him on the ground which he was to occupy during the inclement season, and that he had exerted himself efficiently to provide shelter for his horses. Of course, if the Heavy Brigade was shifted about from day to day, or from week to w week, contrary to his representations and remonstrances, there was an end of his responsibility-but was this so? On the 21st of December, indeed, he writes to the QuartermasterGeneral to renew a previous request for the assistance of Turkish soldiers. On the 29th of January Major SHu,TE by Lord LucAX's directions issues an order that when a hospital hut has been erected for each regiment "the whole at"tention of commanding officers may be devoted "to the drawing of timber for completing the "hutting of horses." This order seems perfectly to corroborate the statement of Sir Joim DrNEILL and Colonel TuLLocH as to the date of the hutting-namely, at the end of January; but we must not lose sight of the fact that the necessity for this operation had been so earnestly pressed upon Lord LucAX's attention by Colonel DARny GntrfrtHs that he threatened to place that officer under arrest if he renewed his remonstrance. The early part of yesterday's proceecdings consisted entirely of an attempt upon Lord LucAN's part to persuade the Court to consider his case separately, and to form their conclusions upon it before entering into the cases of the other officers accused. It is almost needless to say that the request was rejected. If Lord LucAN's conduct has been so unexceptionable as in his own opinion it appears to have been, what has he to fear from incidental revelations in the course of the proceedings? If there be' nothing vhich touches him, it is well; if, on the contrary, anything which affects his character should come ont, he would be either compelled to leave it unanswered or to apply for fresh proceedings if his case were at once concluded. It seems natural enough that Lord CA:nDxG" will endeavour to exculpate himself from much of the matter laid to his charge by pleading the authority of his superior officer ;-would Loid LuAcN really esteem it a boon to be precluded from reply,?

Ax-cIrsT R nws icr THE COnA.-On Thursday evening week Lieutenant-Colonel Munro delivered a lecture at the Bristol Philosophical Institution on the sub- ject of the remains of an ancient buildin', supposed to be I a temple, discovered near the British head-quarters in the Crimea. The lecture was illustrated by drawings and hy an immense variety of specimens of ancient coins, fragments of vases, amphome, patere, cups, &c., found among the ruins, and which the gallant officer had brought home with him. Colonel Munro remarked that he had brought home the relics for the British Museum, and, in the belief that they would interest the inhabitants of a neighbourhood in which he had spent many happy years of his ife, he wished them to be exhibited in Bristol. It was suggested that he should sav a few words upon them to the literary society connected with the institution; he readily did so. He had since been requested to exhibit them in that theatre, and he was there to comply with that request. After detailing the sufferings and praising the heroism of the British army in the Crimea, the gallant lecturer explained the discovery of the remains. The men were employed in making roads, at which some 8,000 soldiers were working, and, as they did not very well like the labour, it became necessary for the superior officers to keep among them. He had 400 men under him, one of whom in diggiing turned up a coin of Romanus; soon afterwards another was found, and then, in excavating further, they came upon a large stone, which, finding that it was wrought on all sides, he knew must have been of some use and importance. In pursuing his researches he traced out what he was convinced were the remains of a t3mple. It was an oblong walled enclosure, measuring 150 feet by 93 feet, and it had at one end a circular form. Its walls, which were 10 feet in thickness, comprised a cyclopean wall and an inner wrought walL He (Colonel Munro) applied to the Commander-in-Chief on the sabject, and was told that he might have 50 men to pursue his investigation, and he accordingly chose some from his own regiment, and went to work. Hie soon found a piece of sculpture, part of the lower legs of a figure, but it was far from good: he also found a reclining figure, similar to those which were always found upon the tombs of persons who had died on the Bosphorus; it was of the rudest execution. After some daystheyfoundawellhavingonits walls traces of some ,ainting, which was not sufficiently perfect to be made out. They then came to a stone having grooves in it, as if for a liquid to run off, and which he felt satisfied had been a sacrificial stone. They also found 16 vessels, all having different capitals, and in all of which 'ere different descriptions of soil, a few bones, and some charcoal. Upon digging down to the building he found, but only at some two feet beneath the surface, parts of a human skeleton, which was, doubtless, of much later date than the building. The vessels could not have held fluids, as they were most of them joined together with lead, and in every one of them he found what some had supposed to be weights, but which he believed were tessera}-a sort of ancient invitation card used upon visiting. One of these capitals was found 10 feet below the level of the mound of earth, so that it must have been 'coeval with the building. He also found a peculiar stone with two holes worked out in it, and in which the victims probably placed their feet when the sacrifices were human. All round the building he found enormous quantities of amphozne, which were used by the ancients for carrying and storing oil, grain, ho. Those amphore were long vase-shaped vessel of coarse clay, peculiarly formed, having double handles; indeed, he could find nothing exactly liko them in the museums at London or Paris. From their shape aud form they were probably of Assyrian origin, and muost likely the temple was an outlying temple from Elherson. The gallant colonel then exhibited various specimens of pottery, glass beads, coins, hc., and proceeded to discuss the probable date of the temple, which he himself believed might have been dedicated to Diana, and whose date he ascribed, from the coins and other evidences, to from 350 to 450 B.C. He exhibited grotesque fragments of incense vessels, iron remains of spear tops, and other matters, and also an exceedingly graceful Grecian female head in terra cotta, which Mr. Hawkins, of the British Museum, and others who had seen it, had pronounced to be one of the most beautiful specimens of ancient Grecian art in Europe, if not in the world. This head, the gallant lecturer said, had been presented to Queen Victoria in the name of the British army, and he had therefore only a permissive possession of it It was found bv a soldier, whose pickaxe, happening to hitch in the mould-hole on the head, brought it up without injury. The head was bound with laurel, and was probably that of Astarte, or some deity. Colonel Munro also exhibited a number of fibulze which he had found in the walls, some flint aTrow and spear tops, and a number of flints. He 4aid he had also collected a large box of bones of the simaller ruminiant animals,such as sheep, kids, ha., and which were probably the remrams of sacrifices. The coins found by him were admitted to be of rare value; some of them ulique. They bore effigies of Minerva, Pan, Apollo, Diana; many had letters forming part of the word Xherson," and some a griffin, the emblem of Pantacapoaum. The dates ranged from about 450 down to 330 B.C.; then there was a long interval, after which they ranged from 300 to about 950 A.D. On the handles of most of thevessels was the name of an officer who used to have charge of the fountains, drains. &c., whioh officer ceased to exist when the Greek cities ceased to be free. Dr. Symonds, in moving a vote of thanks to Colonel Munro, paid an eloquent tribute to those brave heroes to whomt EDngland owed so much, whether they had shared in the glories attendant on the fall of Sebastopol, or had displayed the highest attributes of the soldier-oourage, devotion, and endurance inl the trenchles.
THE UNITBD-STATES. - (IxOY O0B oW COmSPONDzNT.) NEW YORE, 3tAca 25. The discussions upon the Kansas question and the contest among the Presidential aspirants for the democratic nomination at Cincinnati occupy more public attention this week than the English questions. The President-making can be disposed of in a very few words. I take it for granted that all the chances of success are with the democratic candidate. The Republicans will have their Richmond in the field (Air. Seward, or Mr. Chase, or Mr. Fremont, or, perhaps, some person not yet named, that being the usual way), and the once fo,midable Know-nothings have alreadyput up Mr. Pillmore. But it is no disparagement to the latter excellent gentleman to say that he has not a ghost of a chance; and, as to the Republicans, as they have to look for their strength altogether to the North, and must consequently carry the threHe great States of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio,. besides a great many smaller ones, it is not a rash prophecy to say that they have about as little chance. Unless the Administration do some very insane thing during the summer to provoke Northern sentiment, the nomination at Cincinnati will be equivalent to an ellection. The President's chances of securing this have been much weak-ened. There was a time in the winter when he was powerful. The election in New Hampshire (his own State) has gone against him by a decided vote, and his strength may be considered as decidedlyweakened. Mr. Marcy andMr. Cushing have been named frora the Cabinet for the post by their respective friends. It is also understood that Mr. Douglass is not unwilling to have his name used. Up to this time, however, I have heard of no one who combines so many probabilities and so many elements of succes as Mr. Buchanan, the late Minister in London. You will understand, hoevrevr, that these are only opinions of my own. While the supporters of Mr. Buchanan will probably admire the justice of my conclusions, the friends of Mr. Douglass, or Mlr. Fillmore, or MIr. Pierce will, I doubt not, wonder how I can think so. The Kansas question has been before both Houses and produced a great deal of excitement. In the lower Rouse there has been a plan for a committee of investigation to proceed to the territory and examine persons and papers there. After a vigorous discussion this has been adopted. The Senate, on their t, are undertaking to legislate for the future. Mlr. Douglass proposes to admit Kansas as a State when it shall have a population of 93,400. This does not satisfy the Opposition, who press its immediate admission. Mfr. Seward has moved an amendment to Mr. Douglass's bill to that effect, and the discussion bids fair to be longand interesting. Meanwhile, the people of Kansai have taken the matter into their own hands. After forming a State in a manner which the President declares to be treasonable, and against which he threatens to exercise the authority of the Federal Government, they have elected two senators to represent them in Congress-Mr. Reeder, formerly Governor of the territory, and Mr. Lane. The present Congress willhaveto meet this question plump. The sooner it is done and disposed of the better. Unfortunately, both parties desire to use it in the coming election. There have been no new steps taken in the recruiting question since my last letter. It was understood then in Washinz,ton, and still is, that Lord Clarendon had sent to M.r. Crampton for explanation, and that until those explanations no answer would be given. Thefeelinginthe Cabinet, or at least a part of it, is not pleasant towards the British Minister. He is Fegarded as guilty of prevarication in assuring Mr. Marcy that no unlawful enlistmen4 were going on when he was in correspondence with the provinces, and went (as is said) the next day to spend more than a month in organizing a scheme for evading the laws of this country. He is also. regarded as subject to recall from his own Government for having violated the instructions to have no concealments from the United States' Government. In stating these things you will bear in mind that I state only the views which I know certain members of the Cabinet entertain. I do not profess to give my own opinions upon this unfortunate matter. The Cabinet also feel sore at the supposition in England that they are not supported by the public in these questions, and point to the speeches of senators of all parties as indications of the unanimity of pablic sentiment. The Central American question, after all, is the most difficult to manage. I alluded in my last letter to some of the difficulties in the way, especially those grgwing out of the seizure of the Transit Company's property. This Transit Company was originally-an offshoot upon the grant for a canal across the isthmus by way of Lake Nicaragua. The project for building the canal was abandoned, but the Transit Company was expanded into a transport company from New York to San Francisco by the way of Nicaragua, -with the necessary steamers in both oceans. Previous to this, however, two other companies with mail contracts were carrying from and to the same places by way of Panama-viz., the United States 3Iail Steamship Company from New York to Aspinwall, and the Pacific mail steamship Company from Panama to San Francisco. The land passage between the two lines upon this route was done upon mules until the construction of the Panama Railway, since when it .has been done over that road. In the beginning the profits of this business were very great, but competition so reduced them that the steamship lines ceased to declare dividends. The Panama Railroadalone, of all these great tracts of travel, being independent, and baving all its affairs within itself, was earning what it ought to earn on the great tra iic between New York and San Francisco. Several unsuccessful efforts were made to arrange a scale of prices under which the business should be done; until, failing to do that, some of the leading owners in the steamship lines by way of Panama went into the market and bought enough of the stock of the Transit Company to control it, and turned out some of the old managers, and put their own men in the vacant places. Meanwhile Walker's Government had come in, with the assistance of the officers of the Transit Company under its former management. They found a disputed account unadjusted (of the merits of which I am quite unable to form an opinion), and when the change in the administrationl of the company took place, they lent themselves to their friends in the COUp d'ett of which you had an account by the last steamer. They annulled the charter, and declared forfeited property valued at about 6300,000, principally in steamboats upon Lake Nicaragua and the river San Juan, and in miserable buildings for the accommodation of the traffic. I am advised that the Government will be slow in making a decision upon these nice questions. The Attorney-General has the matter in hand, and both Vanderbilt and White, as well as MIarcoletta, who is still the recognized Alinister of Nicaragua, are in Washington. Thus far the opinion inclines to letthe matter drop. Thepassag,eof Americancitizens across the Isthmus is not regarded as stopped by the transfer of these privileges from one company to another. The position that the company is protected by the terms of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty is also denied, since the company has not shown itself able to carry out the enterprise to protect which the treaty woS made. And if the authority of lWTalker is regarded as an usurpation (as it has practically been hitherto) a reinstatement of the deposed Government would, it is said, involve the necessity of a military force in Nicaragua, and a possible conflict with the United States' citizens there, -without effectin, the desired end; because the old Government, if restored, must attack the Transit Company, by the direct aid of which Walker was placed in his present position. This sort of reasoning will show you the present disposition of the Cabinet. Unless there i! some change in the existing inclination of the Excutive, 1 doubt whether Mr. Vanderbilt wi induce the Government to make any decisive more in the matter. This is, of course,a mere speculatioiL It is quite possible that the great exertions that the parties interested are now making in Washington may induce the Administration to change its present purpose. As to the Island of Ruatan, I do not think that the matter occupies the attention of the Government at present. The Cabinet is disposed to regard the claim set up by Lord Clarendon as a right by Filibusterism. They say that Great Britain took possession by an unauthorized and forcible expulsion of the rightfu Government from the island, and that Lord Clarendon sots up no other clabm b5It thtao-n
I :HE SEIZURE OfF GOLDDUST A2T LIERPOOZ. An invstion took Iraoe on Saturday at the Sheffield Jourt of pthy, before.Mr. Comniuiioner West, into the claim of A Jew rnmed Solomon Nathan to golddust f the value of 1,2OOW. seized on board the Lightning at Liver. pool, by the messenger of the Court of Bankruptcy,on mg picion of isbeing the, roprty of a baukrupt.Nathan alamian, of the 1motMkW ad Sajaan, of Sheffield andL Australia, mnerchants A sUmmoDs had been issued against Nathan, to wh aLnd his friend Ritter now appeared. to show the grounds on Wich he claimed the goidaust. They were submnitie to a long examrnation by l!r. Fretson, the solicitor to the Mathan said he travelled -with a box of jewelry, ana wia acommissionagentforapersoninAmerica. The goladusb was worth 1,2001., and he claimed it as havingbeenaentto him by Phineas Beatus, of Melbourne. The only eviden~ce he had in supportof thiswas the bil of lading whichhe bd received from his friend Ritter. Beatus was formerly Jew hawker in Sheffield, but two years ago went to Aus. traha. He had never received any letter from Beatus, except ohie, anouncing his landing at Melbourne. On Tuesday week he was near the railway station at Sheffield, when Bitter and another Jew, ammed Polassl, hailed him from a cab. He took them to his house, where Ritter told him that he had got a good order for him from Beatus, of Melbourne. He said Beatus had sent him 1,2001. worth of golddust, and he must send him back watches, jeelry, an cutlery for the amount ; that Beatus had introsted him with the bill of lading to deliver to him (Nathan), but, being short of money, he had left it with the captain of the ship, as security for a loan of 22. He and Ritter then went over to Liverpool, and B-itter havi borrowed 221. of him pidditto the captain, received the b of lading, and handerdit to him. They went together to Messrs. Baines's to claim the box of golddust, and there found the messenger of the Baruptcy Court, who ordered it to be detained. James Bitter, a Polisb Jew, stated that about five years ago he went from Sheffield to Australia, and there, in part. nership with Polaski, carried on the trade of wine and spirit merchant at Melbourne. Re and his partner returned to England by the UIghtning. A week before they left Melbourne Phineas Beatus, whom he described as " a, general dealer in allparts of the diggings," told him that he wassendinma box containing 29S ouncesof golddustto Solomon Sathan, of Sheffield, and asIed him (Ritter) to take charge of the bill of lading, deliver it to Nathan, andrequest himto buy goods for him to the amount of the golddust, and send them by the next maiL Various questions were then put to the witness by Mr. Fretson, in answer to which he said that Polasla had never made a claim to the golddust. No part of the golddust belonged to witness; but, as Beatus had intrusted him with the bill of lading, he was interested in what became of it. The witness declined to say what Mr. Beatus was to, gve him for bringing it. It was done in friendship. He had never talked with Mr. Salaar about this business on board the vesseL M1r. H. Posnasli, otherwise Polasld, said,-Mr. Ritter and I were partners in Melbourne as spirit merchants. lMr. Beatus and I went to school together. I sawv him shortly before I left Melbourne. He gave Mr. Ritter a bill of lading, and told him to give it to Mr. Nathan, and tell him to buy goods with the produce. I have seen the goldclti and everything. Mr. Beatus gave Mr. Bitter that dircton atTattersall's Hotel, Melbourne. Beatus told:me, be had given Ritter the bil of lading. Mr. Salam n (the bankrupt) then made a statement t( the Court, to the same effect as a letter which appeared in Vtie !l7mes of Thursday from Mir. Salaman, in reply to paragraph, headed a " Lucky Capture." The inquiry here ended, it being ucnderstood that Messrs. Baines would detain the golddust until a clear title was established to it by some one.
ST. MARGARErS CHURCHYARD. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A second letter from " Resurgam," longer than the first, naturally calls for a few words of reply-a few, I say, both because I do not wish to talke up your space unnecessarily, and because I really do not see that there ismuch to grapple with in the letter in question. With the first part of it, in which "Resurgamn" gives us a brief and pregnant sketch of who he is and what are his favourite pursuits, and in which, as isnatmual to the calling he confesses to, we seem, as we read, to see- "The worms creeping in, amd the worms creeping out, " And sporting his eyes and his temples about," as when "the spectre addressed I3nogene," I will not meddle; it is a piece of smart writing, not vithout a, certain ldnd of Pabelaisian humour, and there is an erid. With the second part, however, I must again joinissue with. him. He says I ought to have got a faculty to enable us to turf St. Margaret's Churchyard. He says that I am a Parliamentary agent, or live next door to one, and so ought to have got an act of Parliament to overridethe law. He sys that if we cannot remove the stones covering the remains of the departed Jones or Smith, we should have shovelled fresh soil over them, and laid sods over all. He says that he has been grubbing among the graves, and has carried away three bones; and, finally, he says that the bones are carted away to the outskirts of the tow,n, a prey to dogs and cats, till they eventually settle down into an asparagus bed. Me says more than this, but I had rather not follow him any further. No-, 'with regard to these various assertions of " Ptesur. gain," I will say in reply-first, that we could not get a faculty, and were so advised by a high anthority at Doctor's Commons, whose opinion as to our powers was taken snd paid for. Secondly, that though it is very easy to talk of getting an act of Parliament, and though such an instrument is a very nice thing (and "Resurga;n" may rest assured that if I was a Parliamentary agent, as he surmises I should have been the first to propose obtaining one), it has to be paid for, and it is not soeasytoobtainfroma parish 1,0001. or 1,50L in order to effect that -which, though I and others might consider it a great improvement, would be looked upon by many of the ratepayers in the light of an: unseemlyand undesirable alteration. Thirdly, that if there were any bones turned up, "WResurgam!" had no business to steal them, and that I ara afraid I must give instractions to the policeman on duty to look ont for him in future, and convey himto tochester-row, if he indulges in any more such pastimes. And, finally, and with regardto the last and only really serious charge made against us,-that, of carting aw ay the mould to the outskirts of the to wn,--I wMll simply say that it is untrue; and that, though "R e- surgam," in his experience as an undertak;er-as I must still persist in supposing him to be-may have seen suvh things done, yet if, in the midst of his bone-grubbing and bone-stealing, he had only aslked the question of any one of the workmenain the churchyard he would have learntthat it was so, as they would have told him that whatever mould it is found necessary to removo from St. Margaret's is carefully carried avay and deposited in consecrated ground in the churchyard of Christ Church, in the Broadway. And now, having replied scriatiszu to the chargesmade against me, I tlink I may safely leave "Resurgar.n" I vill not crow, as he has done, and cry " See how I have demolishedmyantogonist;" but I will leave the question as to whether or not I have a leg left to stand upon for the readers of this correspondence (vwhich here on my part terminates) to decide. Inam, Sir, yourmostobedient servant. THE SENIOR CHURCnVAlDEN OF ST. nARGAI.ET'S. k,reaD LeOrge-street, April V.
CHURci ALFAThs IN C0A2iIA.-CoPies of extracts of recent correspondence on colonial church affairs, in the dioceses of Canada and Victoria, have been published on the motion of the Right Eon. W. E. Gladstone, MP. We gather from this correspondence that a determined efforthas been made by the church party in Canada to acquire and exercise the right of synodical action, since the passing of the ClergyReserves Act, by which, as the Bishop of Toronto asserts, the church has been deprived of all her propei;ty, her clergy merely retaining their stipends and aIlowances during their natural lives and incumbencies. The subdivision of the diocess of Toronto was also strongly urged upon the attention of the Home Government. Sir x Head transnitted to the Colonial-office on the 31st of archr 1855, a humble address to the Qaeen (adopted in the Lezislative Council of Canada 7wn di., and m ti Legisative Assembly by 70 to 30 voices), praying for the repeal of such English statutes as impede the mneeting of the clergy and lity of the Church of England in Synod, and that the, choice of the bishops might be left t* the choice of the clergy and laity of each diocess. The address waa duly laid before Her Majesty, anid the subject received the earnest and attentive consideration of Her Majesty's Government. The result of th& deliberats- ct the Cabinet was at length communicated to Sir E. He*d by Xr. Labouchere on the loth of February last. Her lajesty's Government suggested, on grounds assigned, that the Government of Canada should recommend tfhe C4M&adi Legislature to enable the members oE the Church of England in the province to enjoy the freedam sought (so far as the powers of the said Legislature eatended), by empowering them to meet and to form representative bodies, and. by giving to the rules thereby framed far the control of church tsemporalities and the enforcemenÃ¯Â¿Â½ of discipline so much of leg.l force as might be absolutely requisite. At the same time the Colonial Secretary c&2efully disclaimed, on the part of the home Government, mny intent-on or desire of placing the Church of England:in a privileged ur exclusive position in Canada. As .egair2 Victoria, the suggestion of the Government has been alhr,a4y acted on, and a bill of the Victoria Iegislature, " to enable the bisiope, clergy, and laity of the Uinited Chucs, of England and Ireland in. Victoria to provide for the regulation of the affairs of tieL said chjurch," has been eufirmed by the Government at THE PnISONS OFE.LIND.-Tlhe 1th anc 18th la tort of the Inspectors of Prisons for the home district hev& Just been published.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. RMANCE. LZhUML OUt OWY CORFXSFO-L'ET.) [The follawing appeared in our second edition of yesterdaa:-1 Fi'AMIS, SuNDAY. AfrIL (3, 6 P.M. The Congress meets again tomorrow "for des1latch of busiress." Its deliberations, though atUer diminislied in interest with the public since the S-gix:g of the treaty of peace, are still conducted With the same reserve and discretion as before, and the iaxn?e precautions are observed against the chance of publicity. It would not, perhaps, be ouite ttrue to say that the Pleripotentiaries are forgotten by the public, but tlle niterse anxiety excited Ly their fiist few weel;s' deliberations is greatly abated since Sunday last, and, for aught it cares at this nionient, the memlbers of the Conaress may Le amusing themselves with a rubber at whist or a g3me of billi.rds as discussing the subsidiary pCiLti; about the Principalities and Italy. The tra'y is signed; of its ratification there can be no dcubt. The continuance of mystery in the conferences, now that the most impoltant affiair of all is over, is a littlecriticizedand slightly ricliculed; and of couise until the veil is completely lifted up we may expect to hear from day to day various versions of e hat hias passed. For instarice, we are now m- fotm ed that the documents which have already received the signatures of the Plenipotentiaries are in number five, namely, the Treaty, or Instrument de Paix, properly so called; an additional article (not act) relative to the evacuation of the Russian tenitory; a conventionrelative to the Straits-these three are signed by the 14 Plenipotentiaries; hvo amiexes, one of which relates to the AlandIsles, and is signed by Russia, England, and France; aid the other concerning the maritinie polce of the Black Sea, signed by Turley and Russia only. Such is the classification of the papers which now await the approbation and ratification of the various Governments. I give it, as I believe, the latest versio., but without assuming the responsibility of its correctness. One thing, however, is, I fear, pretty certain, namely, the persistence of Austria in refusing to fix a time forthe evacuation of the Principalities. It is givin 2 sonle trouble to the Congress, and ifpersevered in will be the cause of much more. The pretence of Austiia is the necessity of protectirg 'the country against disorder until a regular adniinistration is established. This pretext is flimsy. Austria is 'bound by treaty to quit the Ottoman telritory on the conclusion of peace; and, though the ratification of the treaty of Paris is not yet known, yet, as it is certain that the war is for the present at an end, her conduct would not onily justify doubts as to her good faith, but would establish the necessity of our occupation of the Bosphorus uintil after the complete evacuation of 3loldo-Yallachia. This subject may occupy the attention of the Plenipotentiaries longer than was supposed; and it was said to-day that if circumstances required the departure from Paris of one or two of the Plenipotentiaries in ten days or so they would have to return. Russia is of course adverse to the Austrian occupation of the Plincipalitiez, and the question affords her anple occasion for opposition to a Power she now cordially detests. A considerable reduction of the French army, as oon as all these matters are arranged, is contemplated. France has stil 610,000 effective men; this ninuber willbe brought down to 400,000 directlythe Treaty of Peace is ratified. I mentioned some time since that Baron Brunow was spolken of as one of the candidates for the Paris Embassy. In quarters likely to be informed on that particular circumstance, the rumour is not much credited. Baron Brunow wouild, if his own wishes were consulted, prefer returning to London; and here. it is said, he is not popular, I mean at Court. The Emperor shows a decided partiality towards Count Orloff. The person who at this moment has -the best chance of filling the post is Count Chreptowitsch, now. Russian Plenipotentiary at Brussels. PI. Chreptowitsch has the good fortune to be sonin-lavw to Count Nesselrode. You are aware that Al. Seebach, the Saxon Minister here, stands in the same degree of affinity to M. de Nesselrode. 1. Chreptow itsch is, notwithstanding his name, a Pole. It is now Mlarslhl Vaillant's turn to be spoken of as French Ambassador to St. Petersburg, after so many other names were put forward, but, perhaps, with not more reason. The Iarshal professes ignorance on the subject. Marshial Canrobert ivas and Marshal Bosquet is spoken of for the -portfolio of war, in the event of a vacancy. I merely mention the rumour, without assigning any weight to it. The division of infantry which has been ordered to embark for Algeria is composed of the brigades -of Generals Linieres and Chapuis. It was organized at Paris after the events of the 2d of De-cember, 1851, and placed under the command of General Renault, who hadbeen promoted to therank of General of Division. These troops remained at Paris durinog the whole of 1852 and part of 1853. 'They subsequently occupied the camp of Satory, and towards the month of July, 1854, when it was resolved to form a camp of four divisions of infantry at Boulogne, and two at St. Omer and Helfaut, the camp of Honvault, the nearest to Boulogne, was assigned to the division of General Renault. When the Emperor repaired to Boulogne to command in person the Army of the' North and preside at the grand maneeuvres which were executed at Desvres, the division of General Renault belouged to the corps placed under the special and direct command of His BMajesty. The division returned to Paris in April, 1855, after enduring a rigorous winter in the camp, and was succeeded at Honvault by the division of General Bourgon, which still occupies it. In November last it left Paris for the camp of Sathonay, near Lyons, and was intended to reinforce the army in the Crimea, when the conclusion of peace changed its destination. THE MIEDITERRANEAN. (FT.oM OUR OWN CoRREsPOVNDxD .) MARSETLTES, APRtIL 4. The funeral of the late Admiral Symonds took place in the Protestant cemetery of this town at halfpast 9 this morning. It was strictly private. The Admiral sailed from Malta oa Friday Last in the French steamer Nil, and died on Sunday, of consumption. A regulation which is strictly observed here, to send to the lazaretto at the Frioul every dead body which arrives in the port, was dispensed with in the case of Admiral Symonds, and every facility was afforded 'o his friends to land his remains. The steam frigate Odin arrived this morning from MIalta, whence she sailed on the 31st uit. She has come to take to Constantinople Sir Edmund Lyons, who it is said is appointed Ambassador to the Sublime Porte. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company's packet Valetta likewise arrived this morning from Souathampton. She comes to resume her station on the Indian line, in place of the Alhambra, and will take the outward-bound India mail to Malta on the 12th inst. An important despatch was received at Mlarseilles yesterday, by electric telegraph from St. Petersburg direct, announcing that the Czar had authorized the exportation of wheat from all the RBussian ports. Afif Bey, one of the Secretaries of the Grand Vizier, Aali Pasha, sailed on Wednesday, in the steam sloop Requin, for Constantinople, taking with him the treaty of Paris for ratification by the Sultan. The weather has been extremely boisterous for some days. A small sloop, comiing from Hyeres, was yesterday struck by a heavy sea off this port, and must have foundered but for two fishing-boats which went to her assistance. A considerable fall has taken place in the cornmarket here in consequence of the great quantity of -wheat offered for sale during the present week. 6,800 hectolitres of Algerian w-heat have been sold and delivered at 24f. the hectolitre, and 16,800 lectolitres sold for future delivery at 21f. Polish -wheat is quoted at 20f. the hectolitre. The sugarmaarlet has been sufficiently animated. 3,000 hogsheads of East Indian were sold at 616. the 50 kilogrammes; and 500 hogsheads of inferior at 56f. Coffee is in good demand at from 55f. to 62E. tha 50 kIlogranimes. AUSTRIA. (es'car ou0 OW- COnRnsPONDNh-r.) 2 VIENNA, A1mu 2. Now that the Austrians are at leisure to direct -their exclusive attention to home matters, they begin to display some little anxiety about the future. The public fears that the concordat will lead to inteinal dissensions, and the moneyed world is incined-to fancy that the continu ally increasing dearth of money must eventually lead to a very considerable fal in the priceof alkinds fstock. In short, that dull heavy feeling prevails which commonly follows intense excitement of every kind. There is nothing to be said respecting the con- c rdat at present, but the official advisers oÃ¯Â¿Â½ Bis Holiness are preparing a surprise for the rmor.nstic orders in Austria,whichwillhardlybetotheir taste. Some years ago the Papal Government was in unuiually great financial difficulties, and it was Iroposed to apply to the different Catholic lonarchs for pecuniary assistance; but the Roman Minister of Flinance chanced to recollect that the Royal sons of the Church are seldom in possession of super- I f.uous cash, and the idea was relinquished. Rome has now a better plan "for raising the wind." She is about to order the heads of all ihe Austrian convents (some of which are exfrEmely wealthy) to send in an exact aciount of their annual revenue and expenditure, and they will at the same time be given to understand that a part of the surplus ought in future to be employed " in assisting Mother Church." Now, the Austrian monks are in general piousmen and excellent Catholics, but they are extremely-fond of the good things of this life, and therefore the demand of His Eoliress on their purses isnot likely to meet with avery favourable reception. As it is possible that the 'oregoinga little piece of news may be contradicted by the Ulltramontane party, it may be as well before- hanld to state that it is correct, and that the words* quoted are contained in the original doctument, which is in Latin. The different Constantinople correspondents have announced the dismissal of one or two of the Saltan's Chamberlains, and besides informed the world that many intrigues have been going on since Aali Pasha has been in Paris, but it was not until yesterday that a detailed account of what had occurred reached this city. Aali Pasha was long protected by Redschid Pasha, but vhen the latter found that his protgg enjoyed the confidence of the Sultan, and was likely to remain in office, he became jealous, and taking advantage of his absenceI addressed to the Sultan a memorandum, in which he roundly declared that by theHatti-Humayounthe Grand Vizier "Ihad made tco many and* too umportant concessions to the W'estern Powers, and had betrayed his country." This precious document, which was signed by Redschid Pasha, was presented to the Sultan by Izzet Bey, the Monarch's first chamberlain. After having perused his ex.Minister's memorandum, Abdul M.edjid sent it to his MIinisters, and by their advice dismissed his first, second, and fourth Chamberlains. Nejid Bey, the tlird Chamberlain, now occupies Izzet's place. "Prince Callinal-i, who wvas the author of the plan for organizing or rather disorg-anizing the Danubian Principalities, will not be full Ambassaclor at Vienna. He has an eye to the Wallachian Hospodariate, but he is not likely to get it, as the nation has an invincible objection to Fanaaotes." Private but perfectly authentic news has been received here, that the Emperor Alexander -will be crowned at MDoscow towards the end of Aug-ust. In the Vienna papers we have read that Count Buol was to leave Paris on Wednesday, the 2d, but the intelligence cannot be correct, as despatches were sent to him last night. We are also told that the Northern Railroad Company has agreed to take the Gallidian railroads, but such is not the case. The Minister of Finance -wishes to fix the price for the conveyance of common goods and raw produce at 1 laieutzer per cwt. a German mile, but to this the company objects. The Northern Railroad charges 11 kr., and pays large dividends, but it would lose almost 20 per cent. of its profits if it charged but I kr. The Freamden Blatt learns from Bucharest that there was another collision between the Auistrian troops and the Wallachian militia on Easter Sunday. The Vienna paper says that there is a serious misunderstanding between the two corps, but it takes care to add that the behaviour of the Austrian troops is " exemplary." One of the copies of the Treaty of Peace reached Vienna this morning. PRUSSIA. (moM OUR OWrN ConuXsPONDrNT.) BERIl, AP.RI 5.. At the beg5inning of this week it wvas expected that Baron von fanteuffel would have returned hither before its end, but -we hear now that he will remain in Paris to take part in the conferences on the various subsidiary subjects which still remain to be adjusted. I cannot learn that there isany definitive time mentioned for his probable return. In my letter last Monday I mentioned that the King intended to confer on the MTinister. President the Order of the Black Eagle, as a token of his extreme satisfaction at the conclusion of the peace, but I have ascertained since that even then the order, with an autograph letter from the King, was on its way to Paris. The telegraphic despatch of the Treaty of Peace having been " paraphed5" on Saturday last at Paris reached Charlottenburg the same evening at 9 o'clock, and before 11 o5clock a mounted messenger from -the palace there had brought into town to the Foreignoffice the letter and tle order to be forwarded without any delay to Paris; the parcel containing the latter had also been put up by the King himself, who had uised on the occasion an order that he had perhaps formerly worn himself, so as to despatch the parcel with all expedition, rather than lose time by sending to the General Orders Commission. It is affirmed by several persons about the Court that the order sent is the same that the King himself is in the habit of wearing; but this must be a mistake, as the King's Order of the Black Eagle differs from that worn by his subjects in two Particulars. It is, for instance, surrounded by the English Order of the Garter, with the words Honi solt qui mal y lense, to which the King attaches great value, as having been conferred on him by our Queen; and it also contains an enamel miniature of his mother, the still idolized Queen Louise. The Treaty of Peace-the docunient itself-reached here on Tuesday morning last,-not brought by any special coiuier, as is the case in other countries, but conveyed simply by the ordinary post. The manner in which these things are managed here shows that economy maybe consulted without loss of efficiency. A Prussian courier brought the packet containing it and other despatch,es over the Prussian frontier, and delivered it to the Post office authorities at the first Prussian frontier town; here and at every successive first-class post station it was examined by the chief officer, to see whether the seals were still perfect, and the conductor of the train, to whose charge it was committed, received at each of these stations an official certificate of the time it arrivedl there, and of the state of the seals and envelope. It is probably in consequence of the admission of the two neutral German Powers to the execution of the treaty of peace that the names of the contracting States are not drawn up in two different categories-England, F?rance, c., on the one part, and Russia on the other; in the present document I hear that all the names are cited one after another in alphabetkal order, without any distinction bei~ng made between the antagonistic Powers, or between the belligerent and the neutraL Further, it turns out to be incorrect that the Treaty of Peace has been signed in two different forms, one by tho belligerent Powers and the neutral Austria, and another by the above and Prussia; all the Powers have signed one and the same document in multifarious copies and on an equal footing, without distinction of character. Thiis erroneous idea arose thus: the belligerent Powers had stiUl some matters to settle arising out of the war when the Prussian MIinister arrived in Paris. At the sitting to which the Prussian representatives were invited, at a later hour than the others, to give the latter time to arrange the above-mentioned matters, which fell exclusively to their province to deliberate, it was found fitting and proper that the protocol of the sitting should be divided intotwoparts, the Prussian representatives naturally objecting to puttheir names to transactions in which they' had had no part. The objections thus raised by the Prussian representatives had reference to the protocol or minutes of the day's sitting, and not to any portion of the Treaty of Peace. 6n the part of men in office here there is a strong desire evident to stifle every mention of the various acts of opposition shown by our Government to the admission of Prussia to the conferences, and ever since their opening to Prussia's being received on an equal footing with the others; aud nothing will be left undone by this Government and people to demonstrate their satisfaction at the war having been brought to a close, and at the approaching nearer connexion of England and Prussia. Lord Palmerston has declared in Parliament that the Treaty of Peace is of such a nature that England can be satisfied with it; the Russian manifesto of April 1 states that the object Russia had in the war has been attained. Everybody knows France has al possible reason to be satisfied with the war and its results; and therefore your readers must not be surprised to hear that Prussia is pro-eminently satisfied with the turn the Eastern conflict hlas takea.. From the commencement of this'conflict, and while it Was still in the diplomatic stage, this Government proposed to itself to profit by the European array against Russia`t6ifdids&ate its independence of the latter by the assumption of an bppositional attitude and plain-speaking language; this object has been entirely attained throughon.t; and the subsequent breaking out of the war afforded it an additional opportunity of resisting in the first place the intrigues of Russia to procure her co-operation, and subsequently of declining two formal and distinct proposals for a treatsy of neutrality. One of these was preferred by the Emperor Nicholas himself in person, who.brought with him from Warsawv, when.-he attended the King back to Potsdam in October, 1853,. the document itself, drawn up ready for signature; theF second instance was at the time of Count Orloffs mission to Vienna, January, 1854, when Baron Budberg proposed to this Government a. treaty of neutrality, which met with the same result here as in Vienna. Prussia vwill also be the first Power after Russia to benefit by the conclusion of the peace; the order has already been sent to our fleet in the Baltic to raise thebloclkade of the Russian ports, the advantage of which accrues immediately to Russia, while it is demanded of the latter that she shall in return repeal the prohibition on the' export of grain. The latest telegraphic intelligence that I can meet with from Paris states that in all probability the matter will be arranged there to-day. The repeal of the Russianprohibitiononthe export of grainbeingaprofit and advantage in the first instance to the Russian Government, which wilIlthus dispose of the immense stores it had garnered up in Poland and the countiies round thte Black Sea in expectation of 'a continued war, the next Power to be benefited will be Prussia, by the reopening of the frontier traffic for this article, and the rest of Europe will get only what corn the wants of the Rtssians and Prussians leave unconsumed. Lieutenant-Genelal von Bonin, the late Mhiister of WVar, has recently been appointed Governor of the Federal fortress of Mayence. On his dismissal in 1854 he was appointed to the command of the Prussian fortress of Neisse. The marriage of the Princess Louise of Prussia Mwith the Prince Regent of Baden is to be hastened; instead of Septemwber, as I reported to you a fortnight back, it has been settled, within the last week, that it shall take place here on the 11th of June, the wedding-day of her parents. There is to be a soiree this evening at the hotel of the Russiau Minister, to 'which I am told the representatives of England and France are invited; they are understood to have left their cards at Baron Budberg's imnuediately after the arrival of the news here that the peace was signed, and this festivity, is to be looked on as a feast of reconeiliation. Count Esterhazy, the Austrian Minister here, is just declared out of danger, afterhaving suffered for some time from an inflammation of the lungs. To-morrow there is to be a form of thanksgiving used in the churches for the return of peace. SPAIN. (rxom OuR owv cormEsoz;DNrT.) MADRID, Apim 1. The Government have done as was expected.

Don Saturnino CalderonCollantes, a Senator in the last Cortes, is the President of the tribunal to which this matter has been referred. At the reassembling of the Cortes to-day, and after the routine business had been got throughi, a project of law was presented and briefly supported by Senor Villalobos for the concession to Count de Morny and the other Directors of the Great Central Railway of France of two railway lines, which, leaving the Madrid and Almauza Railway at different points, 'ill proceed, the one from Villarobledo, by Cordova, to Malaga, and the other from Socuellanos to Badajoz and the Portuguese frontier. It was referred to the sections to report upon it. The Three per Cents. were done to-day at 40.25 centimes cash; and the Deferred ditto at 25.10.
THE CORNr TRADE. MARK-LNE, MoNmDY, APRIL 7. The best supplies last week were in wheat and flour; the arrivals of other grain were moderate. The exports were t*ifling,-viz.; 50 quarters of wheat and 18 sacks of flour. The quantity of English wheat was 5,165 quarters, the foreign 14,427; but nearly 9,000 of this v.-as low quality from India and Egypt. The show of samples this morning from Kent and Essex was moderate. Prime qualities of white were in favour at fuill prices, but inquiry was limitei for other sorts at former rates; but little was passing i granaried foreign. b The country flour amounted to 12,837 sacks, the foreiga to 3,133 barrels from America. The change to warmer weather made the sale of Norfolks extremely heavy, and left prices almost nominal; but other kinds and foreiga were unchanged. Of barley, exclusivelylEnglish, wereceived2,378 quarters The best maltin- samples, which continue scarce, went o.fT readily; and other kinds were firni, with a steady trade. Malt has advanced in value Is. per quarter. The total supply of oats consisted of 17,710 quarters,viz., 1,744 quarters English, 7,400 quarters Irish, and 8,56 5 quarters foreign, chiefly Dutch. Business was quiet, and prices unaltered, sales being more difficult in low sorts. Of beans there were 1,287 quarters foreign and 553 guarters English. Of peas, entirely of home-growth, only 252 quarters No abatement was made in the prices o: either of- thesepulse. Linseed was abundant, there being 15,146 quarters, of which 1,300 quarters were from Memel, and the rest from India. Only 450 quarters were exported. The market was well sustained on this arrival by the wants of crushers. The business in cloverseed lass a mere retail complexion, prices being somewhat in favour of buyers. Tares continue difficult to sell. flempseed, mustard, and other seeds remain as last quoted. Aecount of Ceon arrived in Londonfrom March31 to April S.

Consolsfor money were first. quoted .at.93 to i, but, this being the first transfer-day in the stocks lately closed,for i the dividends, several sales were. made, and there was a general decline in quotations, the tendency to dulness being increased~ by -the announcemnent of some further mercantile-failures.

The dividends will be payable to the public at the Bank of England on Wednesday, the 9th inst. There was an active demand for money to-day, wlhch is likely to be maintained during the week, another instalment of 1,350,0001. falIlig due upon the loan on Thursday next. - Foreign securities ivere dull, the transactions having been less numerous, but the late rise in Turkish and Mexican continues to be fairly maintained. The general business comprised-- Buenos, Ayres for account, 594 and 60f; Ecuiador, 5-.; the New Consolidated, 15Xk; Grenada Deferred, 74 and 7 ; Greek, 64-; Mexican for account, 23, 234-, 221,, ald 23; Russian Five per Cents., 106; the Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 95; Spanish New Deferred, 25; Spanish Certificates of coupon not funded, 54per cent.; Turkish Six per Cents., for account, 102 101, i, and 102; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for account, 102 and 1014-; Venezuela Deferred, 13 and 134-: Dutch Two-and-a- Half per Cents., 63-; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 93 and 94&.- The corn-market this morning was steady at former rates. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were .72f. '5c. for money, and 73f. 25c. for the end of the month, showing, in the former case,- a further decline of an eighth. The suspension was announced to-day of Messrs. Saunders and Harrison, seed-crushers, oil-refiners, - and soap-makers. It created great. surprise, the firm being in excellent credit. The liabilities are supposed to be about 60,0001., of which the amount due on acceptauces is said to be 20,000l. The assets are thought likely to yield 15s. in the pound. The disaster is attributed to the reaction in prices consequent upon peace, the house being large holders of produce, and many of their recent sales having been cancelled on an option allowed to the purchasers of declining the contract on payment of a sum far less than the depreciation which has actually occurred. Two smaller suspensions were, also announcednamely, that of Mr. Thomas Harrison, shipowner and asphaltl manufacturer, in conseauence of a connexion with Messrs. Syers, Walker, and Co.; and that of Messrs. Woollett and Nephew, ship and insurance agents. The continental exchanges show great firmness, and, although it is understood gold is still being purchased here for the Bank of France, remittances of French gold coin continue to arrive. At Hamburg the rate of discount remains at 6 per cent. The reports of the manufacturing trade of the country during the pastweek are al favourable. At Manchester there has been an increased business at an advance in prices, the operations for India and America having been large. At Birmingham the termination of the uncertainty as to the price of iron for the present quarter has been followed by an influx of orders, and the falling off in the demand for war purposes is expected to be more than counteracted by the activity from peace. The Nottingham report describes anl improvementin hosiery, and confidence in the lace market, consequent on good accounts of the trade in London. In the woollen districts there has been no alteration, and the Irish linen markets remain with a healtlly tone. The commercial advices from New York to-day are satisfactory, but the stock-market was still inanimate. The spring trade of the importing houses had commenced vith great animation, and buyers in the interior were paying up well. The specie brought on the present occasion is less than was anticipated, being only 35,0001., and the amount would have been smaller but for the circumstance of the balance of the 3Mexican indemnity money (300,0001.) lhaving just been paid, and which was mostly to be remitted to England. Erie Railway stock was at 564-; Reading, 914-; Panama, 105; Nicaragua, 15; and Illinois Central Bonds, 91. All thought of the possibility of war had subsided. One letter from a respectable source concludes with the following postscript, which it may be hoped will admit of contradiction or explanation:-" Mr. Stanley, the English- Vice-Consul at New York, forfeited his baif and went to England by the last Boston steamier." Advices from Trieste to-day furnish the particulam of an important alteration just promulgated in the Austrian tariff. It effects in several cases. a reduction of between 30 and 40 per cent., and is regarded as an experimental step towards a more general abandonment of the prohibitive system.

The weeldy reviews from the Amsterdan arid Rotterdam produce markets state that, although there was little activity, prices were supported with steadiness. Sugar and coi$e had been operated mi to a liniited extent, at about former quotations. The letters from Rouen mention that recent large purchases in the market for manufactures had been followed by a diminution of the ordinary demand. A telegraphic despatch was received at Iloyd's this afternoon from Liverpool announcing the arrival of the Red Jacket from Australia off HIolyhead. She is ex;pected to bring a coasiderable amount of gold. The departures from- the port of L.ondon for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprisedthree vessels-one for New Zealand, one for Port Phillip, and one for Sydney, with an aggregate capacity of 3,109 tons. The rates of freight show no material alteration. -

(5,403,0641.)had been expended on the Lyons and Avignon line, the branch to Aix, the branch to Tonlon, the Marseilles and Avignon line, and the extension to the Rhone, also on account of the working stock and general expenses. A further sum of 51,410,0001. t2,05i,4L0l.) avill be zequired to complete the undertaking and provide the necessary acconmodation for the trsfflc, making together 1SG,4S6,028f. (7.459.440!.). The estimlated cost of the nndertaLning m arch, 185 5, wvas 167,000,OOOf., showsing an increase on the estimate of 19,486,G6Cf. But, as certain amounts will be realizedin favour of the company, the estimated outlay is now fLxed at 184,000,GGCÃ¯Â¿Â½ (7,3G0,000Q) The available assets of the company amount to 179,C00,0AWL (7,184,0001.), leaving a deficiency of 4,400,00(.. (176,000.) to be provided for inrespect of the capital account. The traffic returns for the year 18-5 amounted to 23,309,573f. (932.3331.), and the vorlking expenses to 9,317,745f. (372,710/.), leaving a profit of lS,991,827f. (559,6731.) To this sumi is added 24,401f. from the former account, mnaing 14,016,228f. (560,649!.) From this sum is deducted 2,204,621f. for interest on obligations, 3,213,9132f. interest on loans, 73,428f. interest on current accounts, 98,649f.

(17,4191.) The result of the year's working, under the cireumstances of the line not being completed, is considered highly satisfactory. A call of 100t per share is nade payable in May, out of which the dividend of 73f. is deducted, leaving only 27f. to be paid by the shareholders. Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend of 73f. per share for the year, independent of the interest of 13Ã¯Â¿Â½. per share on the amount paid up; approving and ratifying the convention dated the 19th of December, 1855, entered into between this company and the Iyons and Geneva Railway Company for the amalgamation ofthetwo companies; authorizing the directors to carry the same into effect; and to provide in future for the payment of a portion of the dividend on the 1st of October in each year.

J, UDICIAL COMMITTEE OF sRIVY COUNCIL, Monday, AriZ 7. P,RIh'SEP AND THE HION. EtST Ih'DLi, CO?ME'ANY V. DYCE SOMRE, TROUP, A?ND SOLAROIS. (Before Mr. PEMBERTON' IGH, Sir EDWARD RYAN, Dr. LS-g=GTOD;, and Lords Justices SIGHT BRUCE and Mlr. WaGltr, nm resuming his argument, submitted that the course pursued by Mr. DYCe Sombre with respect to the Baroness Solaroli 'was an expression of his anger at the determination of the baron to leave India against hiis express wish, and to take up his residence in Euro,pe. There were, however, circumstances in her history to justify what the deceased said as to her illegitimacy. When- the marriages of the two sisters took place, and which were celebrated on the same day, a search was made, according to the custom of the Roman Catholic churcb, for their baptismal certificaes; irs T2oup's could be found, but not Madame SoLarolP's. Reghelini, 'who 'was well acquainted 'with the deceased's family, said there 'was always a mystery about the baroness's legitimacy. The assertions, therefore, made bythe deceased on that subject were notto be regarded as delusions, but 'were traceable to the anger he entertained towards the baron. His fears of bein poisoned arose from his Indian suspicions. There were many isolated acts of a strange and eccentric character in 187and 1848 butthey were not sufficient to establish insanity. He was byno means scrupulous as to the assertions which he made. If he had ever cherished any hostile feeling towards the Directors of the East India Company, the will was a proof that it had ceased to exist. Much of his conduct from 1847 to 18>1 'was e:cplained by the fact that his mind was often in a very weak state from the quantity of brandy which he drank, but that would not incapacitate him for acts of business 'when he -. as not under its influence. He was guilty of great indecency at Paris at the latter part of his life, but, looking at his antecedents, it was impossible to draW from it any inferences unfavourable to his sanity. It was proved that when he entered society he was alw.ays remarlably neat in his person and attire-not a sloven. His correspondence at that time was perfectly rational. It vas very important in this case to consider on whom the burden of proof rested. Prima facie, the presumption of lawv was that the deceased was sane. The other side might ay that they had rebutted it by establishing a primin facie case of insanity. He (Mr. Wigrami) conceded it-they had established it by proving the continued existence of the commission, and by direct evidence as to insanity in 1843. The burden, however was thrown back by the order made by the Lord Chancellor in c147, under which Mr. Dyce Sombre was intrusted with the expenditure of thesurplus of his income, amountingto9,000l or 10,_OEp. per annum. The uncontrolled disposal of such a surn was inconsistent with the assertion that he was in a state of incapacity. Hle (Mr. Wigram) did not remember any other case 'where, during the continuance of a commis;ion, such a fortune had been intrusted to a man. Before the commission itself could be superseded every doubt wust be removed. The order of 1S47 was much stronger evidence of capacity than the continuance of the commission was of the reverse. The commission was issued not on the ground of particular delusions, but of general unsoundness; the evidence, however, as to the state of the deceased at a later period completely negatived general insanity. The physicians by whom he was e-xamined, under the order of the lord Chancellor, in 1847 and 1848, failed to detect any delusions. What they relied upon in 1848 was the alleged delusion asto the illegitimacy of the Baroness Solaroli ; buthe (Mr. Wigramn) contended that that was only the fabrication of a vindictive man-not an insane delusion. Those physicians grounded their report upon the suspicion that the deceased concealed his delusions, but it was impossible that he could have done so for three days, the period during whichthe examination was continued. Opposed to their viewsthere wasthe direct evidence of five physicians in 1S8-of those who attested the will, of the solicitor by whom it was drawn, and the very deliberate character of the act itself. A great deal of the judgment in "W Waring v. Waring" 'was extrajudicial, and could be no authority for the decision of this case. With regard to costs, they 'were entirely in the discretion of the Court; stiM the Court, in deciding that uoint, was guided by the consideration of rules and principles. The Court below was quite right in making no distinction between the case of Mr. Prinsep and that of the East India Company. It was clear that Mr. Prinsep, in pgopounding the wiDl, was only the agent of the East India Company, and if there had been any misconduct that was no reason for throwing the costs upon either of them. The leaned Judge of the Prerogative Court had not exercised any discretion 'whatever; he had assumed uisconduct, and on that ground had condemned the parties in the costs. The East India Company found themselves in a very difficult position. They had been constituted residuary legatees, and it was necessary either to propound the wwilt and expose themselves to expenses, or, on the other hand, to abandon it, and incur thereby the risk of public censure. The will had been executed with the greatest care and caution some time after *the lst decision was given by the Lord Chancellor. It was a case in which the costa ought to he paid out of the estate. LJord Justice KMGIG}T BRrCE inquired if any conjecture had been formed aw to the total amount of costs ? The ATTO R.EY-Gra,ErAL said, it had been whispered in his ear that they might amount to 20,0001., but that was less than the accumulation of interest since the suit commenced. Lord Justice KIsrGcnT BlrcE said, that Lord Eldon once dismissed a bil], and yet gave the plaintiff his costs out, of the estate. The QrtNs's ADVoCATE then proceeded to address their Lordships on behalf of the respondents. One great delusion of the deceased was his belief in the continual and ilagrant infidelity of his wife. She had been reluctantly compelled to place him under restraint, and then, according to the practie of the Court of Chancery, she wvas appointed com=ittee of his person. It could hardly he expected that she should leave him at liberty to repeat his assertions that she was an incestuous adulteress. The great object of the wi was to deprive her of any benefit in his estate, and the result of years of litigation was, that the Court of Probate had pronounced a deliberate judgment against the deceased's testacy, 'wiich, with the exception of one or two points, had not been impugned, save' as to costs. 3rs. Dyce Sombre had gone through 'what few ladies had ever had to encounter, and that against the most active, micat able, and most unscrupulous opponents. Her conduct had already elicited the approbation of one Lord Chancellor. There was a total difference between the case made in the court below and that presented before their Lordships. No intimation was given there that this was the suit of the East India Company, but it was now admitted so to be. rr. Prinsep, in the court below, stoutly denied insanity at all, and now it was admitted that the deceased had been insane, but it was contended that 'when the will was made he had recovered. He (the Queen's Advocate) had nothing to do with the moral character of Mr. Prinsep, he had only to deal with his character as a litigant. The period of the deceased's recovery 'was now fLxed as tamking place iu 1S47 or 184S; a number of sham pleas therefore had been put on record. The ATrOREV-C,EYGESE s;aid, the pleas neither admited nor denied insanity; they left the Court to draw its own inference. The QrEE:.'s ADvocATE said, that Mr. Prinsep had distinctly denied that the deceased at any period had laboured under insane delusions. The case of "W Warin v. vWaring," and of "Fowlis v. Davidson" (6 Notes of Cases), had a direct bearing' on the points at issue. "Cart'wright V. Cart'wright" (1, P~hil.), " Austin v. Graham" (8 M100re, P. C.), and "M3udway v. Croft" (3 Curt.), cited on the other side; 'were no authorites in the present case. The learned advocate then cited Pritchar d on Isssosiit,., p. 6; Re,' AfediiCal .Thristrel-sence, pp. 103S, 24a, and 219; and Dr. Connolb,z on Insxndtz, p. 337; wvhich, he contended, laid down principles directly .applicable to the case of Mr. Dyce Sombre. Their Iordships then adjourned until to-morrowv (this dy).
LAW REX?OBT. ROLES' COURT. CMUNCERY-LAN-F APPrr. 7 _ _- lVKDDERBL7RX V. WEDDERBUBN'. (Befcre the MASTER of the RoiM.Is IDe aSTEa of the ROLLS gave judgment in this case which originally came before the Court in the time of Lord langdale, and has been from tine to time reported in different stages. The facts of the case, as far as material, are as follows :-In the year 1796 a partnership wvas entered into between the then Messs. WVedderbuni and a Mr. David Webster, one of the conditions of the partnership deed being that, when any of the nartners should die, the goodwill of the business, subject to certain conditions, should vest in the surviv-ing partners. Four years after executing the deed of partnership Mr. David Webster died, leavinE the Messrs. Wedderburn, his partners, the executors of his will, and leaving his property generally among his children. In 1801 the partnership accoumts were taken, ard new books opened. Upon takingthe accounts itappeared that the assets of the firm, up to the death of 31r.: David *Webster, amounted to 496,0001., and the liabilities to 411,0001., leaving a balance in favour of assets of 85,9S21. Of this latter sum it was estimated that 55,0001. was due to the estate of Mr. David Webster. At this time, howvever, it was considered impossible to realize the assets of the firm, many of the debts being owing from large Jamaica houses, -which required time for payment, and, if pressed, might not havepaid at all. This being the case, the surVLving partners thought it advisable not to attempt to realize the debts under pressure, but to find money out of their own pockets to meet the outstanding liabilities. This they did, and carried on the business so successfully that, as the children of David Webster came of age, they were able to pay themi their respective shares of the 55,0JO. due to the estate of MIr. Webster, together with legal interest on the same. In the year 1831 some of the children of Mr. Webster were led to suppose that, besides receiving their share of the 55,0001. and interest, they were entitled to receive a share in the profits of the firm from the year 1801, when the sum of 55,0001. was found due to their father's estate, and thev accordingly filed their bill in this court for an account. In 183G Lord Langdale, upon the hearmg of the cause, directed that the account asked for should he taken, and referred the suit to a Alaster in Chancery for that purpose. The Master in 1846 made his report against the claim which the children of fr. Webster had put forward. This report wasreferred back to the Master by Lord Langdale, and another renort was made in the case, much to the same effect, in the year 1S55. To this last report exceptions were taken, and it was - upon these exceptions that the case now came before the Court in a form suficiently definite to enable his Honour to express an opinion on its merits. This he did by stating his conviction that Messrs. Wedderburn, the surviving partners, and executors of the will of Mr. David Webster, had not only executed their trust with fidelity, but made use of a wise discretion in managing the business in the way they had done; inasmuch as if, at the time Mr. David Wrebster died, they had pressed the claims of the firm they would, in all probability, bave lost the greater part of the debts that were due, and, instead of being able to realize the proportion of the assets due to Mr. Webster's estate, been obliged to wind up the affairs of the firm to the subsequent detriment of every one interested. The children at Mr. Webster were greatly indebted to the prudence which the Messrs. Wedderburn had exercised, and, inasmuch as they 1:ad received all principal and interest to which they were en,titled under the wMil of th%t gentleman, they had no uight to come in and make a claim npon the profits of the firm realized subsequently to the year 1SOl. such profit; mainly, if not solely, being attributable to the goodwil of thefinn, and to the prudence, discretion, and independent advances of the surviving partners. Under all the circ-umstances of the case, there would be a declaration, therefore, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to any share in the profits of the business subsequently to the year 1801, the amounts already received by them in respect of the 55,OOOL. due to the estate of fr. Webster havin- completely covered any claim they might have against the 1;n.

A.LTDERSLEy.1 The terms of the compromise come to between the parties in this case which was noticed in tie Times on Saturday last, were as follows :-The plaintiff to transfer his shares to a person nominated by the defendants upon receiving the nue of auch shares. The amalgamated company to contmiue an annuity heretofore payable to the father of the plaintiff but alleged by the defendants to have terminated by thefr dissolution, and a debt of 500. due from him to be cancelled, he giving up a claim made by him. Upon these terms the bill to be dismissed without costs. Mr. Swanston and Mr. W. W. Cooper appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Rolt, Mr. Baily, Mr. Glasse, Mr. C. Berkeley, and Mr. M'Christie for the defendants. The VICE-CiLAxCELLOn sanctioned this arrangement. (Before fice-ChanCellosrSirJ. STUART.) JAE]IS V. GOYNNE. This was a motion on behalf of the plaintiff to stay the certificate of the Chief Clerk, dated on the 10th of March last, and that the plaintiff might be permitted upon such terms as to the Court might seem just to prosecute the inquiry contained inthedecreemadeinthecause onthel4th of December, 183, and to have the account taken whichwas referred to in such decree. The bill was instituted in 1844 to establish a deed dated in September, 1837, whereby certain lands had been conveyed to trustees upon trusts for the plaintiff's benefit. By the decree made on the 14th of December, 1853, the deed was declared to be valid, and an account was directed with a view to ascertain the amount due to the plaintiff, which amount, together with the plaintiff's costs of this suit, was directed to be raised by sale or mortgage of the lands comprised in the deed of September, 1837. Subsequently to the date of the decree negotiations were entered into between the plaintiffand defendants, the object of which was to compromisethe matters in dispute between them. Early in December last a summons was taken out on the plaintiff's behalf before the Chief Clerk, which was adjourned, in order to enable the plaintiff to coniplete his evidence; and ultimately, on the 10th of March last, the Chief Clerk certified that the plaintiff had made default and had not produced any evidence to enable the Chief Clerk to answer the inquiry, and take the account directed by the decree. The plaintiff Iupon that occasion tenderedhis evidence, and offered to proceed with the inquiry, but the Chief Clerk held that such evidence had been adduced too late. Mr. Southgate supported the motion; and Mr. Bacon, Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Freeling appeared for the defendants. The VICE-Cxr,,NcELLoR sRaid that this was a very important case with reference to the practice of the Court, hle bill was filed in 1844, and in 1853 the plaintiff obtained a decree giving him the right to prosecute certain inquiries in chambers. The Chief Clerk, by his certificate dated on the 10th of March last, certified that "the plaintiff had made default, and had not produced any evidence to enable him to answer the inquiry, and take the account directed by the decree." The object of the present application was to allow the plaintiff to do what he ought to have done in 1853. Such an application lie (the Vice-Chancellor) thought ought not to be tolerated, particularly in the present state of the practice of the Court, -which required the rights of litigants to be adjusted as speedily as possible. The motion must be refused w^ith costs. SMEPPARD V. SnM'nr. This case was spoken to on the minutes, upon a question whether a testator's debts and legacies were payable out of his personal estate, or whether that and the real estate were, by the will made, one common fund out of which the payment ought to be made rateably. The testator, after directing mourning to he provided for servants, and to be paid for out of his personal estate, gave various legacies, and then gave all his real and personal estate to trustees upon trust to pay all his debts and legacies, and subject thereto upon trust for three persons named, one of whom died in the testator's lifetimec Mr. Sm3the, Mr. De Gex, and Mr. Brodrick appeared for the several parties. "Boughton v. Boughton," (1, Houselof Lords cases, 414), was referred to. The VICE-CIMLnaML0R held that the debts and legacies were payable rateably out ofthe real and personal estate. (Before Vice-Ch7ancello- Sir W. P. WOOD.) REwVxIGoIS TRUSTS. A question of some interest arose in this petition, which was presented under the Trustee Belief Act, for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of the several claimants in asum of 4,7251.1 New Three per Cents. Joseph WVright; by his will, beafiDg date the 2d of Ntovember, 1811, bequeathed to certain trustees a sum of stock now represented by 4,7251. Mewv Three per Cents. upon trust to pay the interest and dividends thereof to the testator's son William Wright during his life, and after his death to transfer and assign the capital sum unto and equally between or aniong all and every the child or children of the said William Wright who shouldbe living at the time of his decease. Joseph Wright, the testator, died on the 5th of June, 1814. WilUiam Wriaht, in 1802, married PaiyHareburgh, in Scotland, by whom he had seven children, of whom only two, the present petitioners, sunsived him. Mrs. Wright died at Collum-ptonin February, 1821. WVilliam Wright, upon the death of his wvife, went to Bath, and assumed the name of Browine, for the purpese of avoiding his creditors. Being in a state of pecuniary embarrassment, he went to France early in 1823. Soon afr his arrival he formed an improper connexion with Florentine Melanie Roger, a Frenchwoman, who had been engaged- as his housekeeper. Being unable, from the fact of his bearing an assumed name, to obtain the certificate required by the French law for the celebration of the marriage, he had recourse to the minister of the English church at St. Omer, who, in Mlarch, 1824, performed the marriage ceremony between William Wright and Florentine helanie Roger. This marriage was admittedly void by the laws of both France and England. A daughter, florentine, was born in December, 1824. Eaving made arrangements with his creditors in England, William Wright resumed his own name, and on the 23d of August, 1841, was married to florentine Melanie Roger, at the British Embassy at Paris, according to the rites of the church of England. On the 19th of November, 1846, the marriage ceresmony was performed between the parties according to the forms of the French law, upon whie occasion the daughter Florentine waseec aodge nd legitimated according to the form prescribed by the lawof France. William Wright died infn which contry he had resided without intermission from 1823. On the 5th of December, 1854, the trustees had p aid the fund into| couLrt under the Trustee Belief A ct, and the question now arose as to whether Florentine, the daughter born in France, waes entitled to share in this fund with the two surviving daughters by the first marriage. The opinions of M. CrCmieux and other French advocates had been taken and were produced in evidence, but,were somewhat conflicting. Mr. Wright's daughter Florentino had married Henry Williams, an Englishman, living inthe Faubourg St. Antoine, in Paris. Mr. ROLT and Mr. SuxAsAGE, for one of the daughters by the first marriage, contended that the daughter Florentine could not share in this fund. The attempt at a marriage in 1824 being admittedly void, the subsequent marriage and act of legitimization had no effect towards altering the original status of Florentine, or rendering her legitimate either by the law of France or England, and that, at any rate, even if she had acquired the condition of a legitimate child, it did not follow that she was entitled to take as one of the children of Williami Wright under the words of the wilL William Wright had not acquired a French domicil, which was shown, among other circumstances, by his having obtained exemption from service in the National Guard in 1830, on the ground of his beinm a British subject. Being an Englishman, the marriage according to the French law, in 1846, and attempt to legitimize the child were a nullit wlhile the marriage at the British Embassy, in 1841, could have no effect as to rendering legitimate an illegitimate child. Mr. WILICOCic and Mr. ILiJSLAKE, . for the other surviving daughter of the first marriage, adopted the same line of argument, and contended that the status of a person was incapable of being affected or altered by the acts of other parties after his birth, and that the fund which had become vested in the children of the first marriage could not become subsequently vested in such further child by an act of foreign lawv subsequent to the illegitimate birth. M. .W. Mt. J.nEsn and Mr. WxLLER, for Florentine Williams, contended that William Wright was domiciled in France, and that the country of the father's domicil determinued the status of the child. Every act necessary, according to the French law, for rendering a child born before marriage legitimate had been performed, and the. consequences, according to the French law, must follow, that such child was entitled to the same rights as if it had been born during the marriage. They cited the folowing articles of the French Code Cicilc as defining the rights of children so circumstanced " 331. Les enfans n6s hors du marinage, autres que caux n6s d'un commerce incestneux ou adult6rin, pourront ctre 16gitim6s par le mariage subs6quent de leur pere et mere lorsque eux-ci les auront legalement reconnus avant lenr manage, o aqu'ils reconnaitront dans racte meme de c6l6bration.

INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COUBT, April 7. TN RE CHTARTLF.S RACA. (Before thc CmE3 ComriIssxIoR.) Mr. NPOUBRIEY applied for leave to file a petition under very peculiar circumstances. The insolvent had been confined for debt in Lancaster Castle since October, and his overty had prevented him from applying to the Court. In Debruary his detaining creditor had obtained a vestingorder, but he had not filed his schedule, because Mr. Addison, the County Court Judge of Lancaster, was of opinion that the Act 10th and 11th of Victoria, chap. 102, transferrin-g the business in the cireuit to the County Court judges only referred to insolvente' petitions, and not to creditors' petitions. The difficulty was, what the insolvent was to do, and the only relief was to alow him to file a petition notwithstanding the one in court, so that he could he heard at Lancaster. The C^rx CossnrrssroNoz was of opinion that the act applied to all petitions, and he had given his view on another occasion. An order for hearing would issue from this Court for the judge to hear the case. The insolvent could file his schedule on the creditor's petition. (Before Ar. Commissioier Prisrns4 IN RE EDWARD WATTS. This insolvent, an attorney, at fythe, in Kent, holding several situations, as clerk to the County Court at Hythe and clerk to the magistrates, applied under the act. hfr. Nichols appeared for Mr. Richard Payne, and Mfr. Dowse for another creditor named Andrews; M1r. Sargood (Mr. Reed with him) supported. The debts on the schedule were 90,399L. 7s. 5d., and the consideration debts 69,2101. The debts due to the insolvent were 27;5751., with a statement of property. Mr. SARGOOD, when the case was called, made a statement in order to obtain an adjournment. The Court would .ee from the voluminous schedule that it was a case which had required attention. In Februarylast year the insolvent made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, conveying property to a very considerable amount. About 86 creditors, to the amount of 62,0001., had come in under the assignment. There were eight creditors representing abont 10,0001., who did not come in, who were secured, ancd 19 creditors who held no security, to the amount of 6,2001. The two creditors who now opposed represented about 2,0001. In a case of this description some difficulty was expected as to the schedule, and inquiries n ight be made with advantage out of court. He w ould therefore suggest that an adjournent be taken for a month, the insolvent being ont on bail in the interim. tor. Commissioner Pa 's asked if the parties agreed to an adjournment ? Mr. NIosOLS and Mrr. DOWSE expressed their consent. The case was then adjourned to the 19th of May to settle. I2 RE VVILLUr DURAIT. This was an application for a protecting order. The insolvent had been heard andhiscaseadjourned sine die. On leaving the tourt he was arrested at the suit of Mr. Burke the opposing creditor.

SPRTNG ASSIZES. NORTHERN CIRCT. 1AVIMEOOL, APR11. 7. UMIVIL UOURT.-Before Ar. Justice WILLES and a Special Jury.) LEWYIS V. BIROMTELOW. This was an action to, recover damages for a breach of contract. Mr. Forsyth, Q.C., and Mbr. Quain appeared for the plaintiff* and Mr. Edward James, Q.C., and Mr. Melhuish apDeared for the defendant. li'rom the opening statement of the learned [counsel it appeared that the defendant possessed salt mines in Cheshire, and the plaintiff dealt in salt mDublin. Mr. Falk, a commission-agent, on behalf of the plaintiff, in January, 1852, went over to St. Helen's to see Mr. Bromielow, and ascertain whether he would make an engagement to supply salt to the plaintiff. Mfr. Bromielow agreed to supply to Mr. Lewis 2,000 tons of common salt in the course of the year at Dublin. The deliveries were very irregular; and in Septem ber, 1853, Mr. Bromnielow was at Dublin, and the I plaintiffmade a complaint to him of the irregularity. The defendant promised to make it all right; hbut a residue of s2enta badneveryet been delivered, and hence the present action. After a few witnesses hadbeen examinedthe plaintiff was nonsuited. HILLCOAT, CLERK, V. COOKE, CLERK, AND OTHERS. This was an action for a libeL Mr. Tindal Atkinson (wvith whom was Mr. AsDinall) appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Edward James, Q.C., and MIr. hElward appeared for the defendants. Mr. ATKNSON, in opening the case, stated that the plaintiff Dr. Billcoat, was a Doctor of Divinity in the Church of Enaland, and at an advanced period of life, during 40 years of whichahe had been engaged as a clergyman. The defendant, Mr. Cooke, was also a clergymau, and both parties were resident in Liverpool. It appeared that the p laintiff had formier31yofficiated at Bath, but in the year 1835 he became the incumbent of St. Matthew's district church, in Scotland-road, where he remained until 1835, when he was arrested and thrown into Lancaster Castle for a claim of 1271. for " costs" in an unsuccessful suit in the Court of Chancery. During his incarceration he was introduced to the rev, defendant, and after some negotiation it was agreed that the defendant should take the entire spiritual charge of the church and schools in Scotland-road. The defendant continued to officiate in the church until the commencement of the year 1855, when the plaintiff first heard of "rumours" reflecting upon his character which the defendant had circulated. This led to an angry correspondence, in which both parties seemed to have dealt in mutually severe strictures, and the plaintiff having, through the kindness of some unknown friend, been veleascd from prison, at once proceeded to Liverpool, and gave notice of his rntentionto take the duty at St. atthew's. Upon this both parties ap;cealed to the Bishop of Chester, who decided that the plaintiff, as incumbent, was perfectly entitled to take the duty upon giving the usual notice. The defendant, who had evidently nisapprehended the effect of the written agreement under which he had taken charge of the church, then appealed to his co-defendants, who -were some of the leading members of the congregation, and had espoused his cause, and, feeling himself stung by some observations which had been made by the plaintiff in- a printed letter addressed by binm to the members of the congregation, in which he imputed fraud and falsehood in the accounts which the defendan t had rendered respectingthe schools, &c. was induced to publish a pamaphlet in his owvn exioneration, and that pamphlet contained the libel complained of, mn which the defendant animadverted very strongly upon the character of the plaintiffi The facts having been proved by the plaintiff, Mr. Edward James rose for the purpose of cross-examining him, when Mr. Justice WILLEs (addressing Mr. James) said,-Mr. James, it is quite clear that there has been in this case a blast and a counter-blast. Mr. J4ums.-Yes, my Lord, I agree with your Lordship, but the blast by the plaintiff has not yet been heard; the public and this Court have only heard as yet the counterblast from the defendant; and the learned counsel was proceeding to read extracts from the circular of the plaintiff, showing great provocation upon his part, when Mr. Justice WsILuES said,-There has been clearly snuch provocation; now that we are arriving at the acrimonious part of the case, I think it my duty to say it -would be much Letter, for the sake of Christianity, to refer all matters in dispute to some arbitrator to be agreed upon between the pasties. The learned counsel on both sides having conferred, a formal verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to arbitration. SECOND COUTr.-{(BCfO-c Afr. Baron MARTUT ansd a Special Jury.) HULL V. BOLLARD. Mr. Edward James, Q.C., and Mr. Hindmarch appeared for the plaintiff, and Mfr. Hugh Hill, Q.C., and Mr. 0. Hatton appeared for the defendant. Mr. JnnEs, in opening the case, stated that the action was brought by the plaimiff, who carried onthe business of a miller in Liverpool, against the defendant, also in the same businem in Liverpool, for an infringement of a patent granted to the plaintiff in April, 1855, for an improvement in cutting the main furrows in the grinding faces of millstones, by which, in some in,stances, double, and in others tiple the quantity of four might be obtained within the period of~ an hour from that produced by the old stones in that lame. The circumstance of the defendant having used the plaintiftfs patent havisg been proved, Mfr. HILL, upon the part of the defendant, insisted that the mode of cuttmig the main furrows was not new, although the combination of two different furrows was so, and called various witnesses to prove that they had seen them in nse before the plaintiff's patent was granted. For the plaintiff it uas urged, in reply, that the defendant had not given him any notice of the objections, as required by thc Patent Law Anneudment Act, 185L. MIr. Baron MAI.RVIN admitted the evidence, and finally the plaintiff was directed to be nonsuited without prejudice to a motion for a new trial. This case concluded the business of these assizes.
CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, A.irU 7. The sessions of the CentralCriminal Court for the month of April was opened this morming by the Right Hon. David Salomons, the Lord Mayor, the Right Hon. J. A. S. Wortley, MP., the Recorder, Aldermnan Sir 3. Duke, Sir e. Ma&rshall, and Sir H. Muggeridge, Mr. R. H. Kennedy, and Mtr. W. A . Rlose, the Sheriffs of London and Mtiddlesex, Mr. D. H. Stone and Mr. J. A Rose, Under-Sheriffs, &c. The first edition of the calendar contains the names of The RECORDFER, in charging the grand jury, said he was happy to informn them that although the interval since the last sessions had been somewhat longer than usual the calendar was not unusually heavy, either in point of number or in the gravity of the oflences contained in it. There were two very distressing cases of mugrder to be disposed of, but as the bills in these cases were found at the last sessions they would not occupy the attention of the grand jury on the present occasion. The great majority of the other cases were of the ordinary character and did not appear to hin to present any legal difficulties, and therefore he should not detain them unnecessarily from the performance of their duty by making any observations respecting them. The only two classes of offences that appeared to present any increase were those of burglary and coining. In the winter time, when the nights were long, an increase of the crime of burglary was generally expected to take place, but it was an unusual circumstance at this period of the year, and he was not aware that it could he accounted for in any satisfactory manner. This sort of offence was always regarded by the Court as one of a very serious kind, because it not only interfered wNith the safety and secuirity of dwellinghouses, but when committed in the dead of the night it tended to cause great alarm, and, in many eases, the lives o' the imnates of the house that was attacked were put in danger. It was, therefore, imperative in every case where a conviction took place for this offence to pass a very severe sentence, and he believed the same course was taken by every other judge, and he hoped that tbis would have the effcct of checking the crime. There appeared to be a very considerable increase on the present occasion of offences against the Mint, and it had been his misfortune on several recent occasions to inake the same observation. This might possibly be accounted for to some extent by thse increased vigilance of the police in detecting offenders of this description, but he was afraid that the principal cause of the increase was the facilities that were afforded by recent scientific iiiventions for committing- offences of this description. They mustall of course rejoice at the extension of science, b;t, like all known inventions, it had its concomitant inconveniences, and the beautiful science of electrotyping had undoubtedly been made subservient, to a considerable extent, to the purpose of fabricating base coin, and rendered it more difficult of detection. He mentioned these facts for the purpose of stating that it was the determination of the Court to punish offences of this description with great severity, and at the same time of calling the attention of tradesmen to the subject with a view to their exercising greater vigilance with reference to the coin that was presented to them. At the same time lie would observe that tradesmen would do well to exercise caution in another manner in reference to these matters. It was obvious that any one might accidentally be in possession of a base coin, and that it' ight be offered in the most innocent manner, and withoubt the slightest intention to de- fraud. He regretted to see, however, from those channels that were available to them all that several cases had recently occurred in which persons had, to say the least, been very incautiously'given into custody on the charge of uttering counterfeit coin upon the mere fact that the coin they lad offered to pm-s had otned out to be bad. This had not happged merelyinthe case of persons in an humble position of ife, and it could not therefore he said that such persons were the principal sifferers by such a course of proceeding, but in several instancespersons of undoubted respectability had been so treated. Be therefore observed that tradesmen should be cautious when base money was presented to them, and that it was their duty to ascertain vho the persons really were, and whether there was a reasonable probability of the act being fraudulent and not the result of accident or mistake, before they gave the ,person into custody, because when this was done it unavoidably occasioned serious inconvenience, and was a great hardship upon the person so accused. William Burns, a re table looking man, surrendered to take his trial for stealing a quantity of lead and iron, the Iroperty of Joshua Walker and others. lhe Prisoner pleaded " Guilty." 3fr. E. JAMES, Q.C., who was specially retained, with Mr. Huddlestone, on the part of the prisoner, addressed the Court, and said that, after the best consideration he and his learned friend had been able to give to the case and to the circumstances connected with it, they had come to the conclusion that the course the prisoner had taken was the best that he could adopt, and it was with their sanction that he had pleaded "guilty" to the charge. He, atthe same time, begged to inform the Court, that the prisoner had been in the service of the prosecutors for a great many years, and in consequence of his former character they were anxious to recommend him to the merciful consideration of the Court. ?fr. BALLANTLJE said, he appeared with his learned fniend Mr. Panry to conduct the prosecution, and he was instracted to state that the prisoner had, almost from his childhood, in some shape or other, been in the service of the prosecutors, and this must have extended, over a period of 35 or 36 years. The prosecutors carried on a very extensive business as lead merchants at Lambeth, and undoubt- edly for a great many years the prisoner had conducted him-' self honestly. Latterly, however, he had become connected with persons vwhose conduct it appeared to him was even more culpable than that of the prisoner, and he could not understand why they v-re not sent here to answer for their conduct. It appeared that they had almost driven the prisoner to commit the offences with which he was charged, but, although they were the most guilty persons, they had escaped punishment altogether. The prosecutors, on account of this 'circumstance, and the former good character of the prisoner, wvere extremely anxious to recommend him to the merciful consideration of the Court, and they believed that no public injury vvould accrue from mercy being extended The REcoRDERi said, he had read the depositions, and it appeared to him to be a very serious case indeed. The prisoner was in a situation of considerable confidence, and he had taken advantage of that circumstance to plunder his employers to a very large amount. Mr. Bsn.nArnuNs said the prisoner was a foreman. The RECORDER inquired vhat salary he received? Mr. BALnANxrE said his salary was 1501. a-year. The Rconnxn observed, that he could not understand how a man at his time of life could be driven to commit an offence of this description, although it might very well be that he had not resisted the temptations that were held out to him. e would, however, cansider all the circumstances before he pronounced sentence. Mr. JAMES said that a great many highly respectable witneises were m attendance to speak to the prisoner's chafacter, but, after the handEome and kind conduct of the prosecutors, he felt that it was unnecessary to call them. The RECORDER said that the long period the prisoner had been in the service of the prosecutors was a sulicient proof of his former character and the estimnation in which he was held by them, and it was unnecessary to produce any further evidence upon that point. The prisoner was then removed from the bar. James . Maylard, 42, described as a traveller, pleaded "guilty" to a charge of embezzling money, the property of Mtessrs. Colman and Co., his masters. MJr. Parry conducted the prosecution; Mfr. Ballantine was counsel for the defence. The prosecutors in this case carry on their business in the city, and it appeared that the prisoner, who was emp'oyod in a confidential capacity, had embezzled money to the amount of more than 1,0001., which he had received on their account, and applied to his ow use. Mr. BAnnx;Trm-x said that all he could urge on behalf of the prisoner was the facts that he had heretoforeborne an unimpeachable character, and at the time he entered the service of the prosecutors he was embarrassed, and his creditors, finding that ho had got a good situation, pressed hInm so closely that hewas induced to make use of themoney he had received on account of his employers to relieve himself. Sentenced deferred. NEW COURT. (Before the CoMNO2O-SERJEANT.) JohnEHall, 50, dealer, was indicted for feloniously receiving a watch valued at 181., the property of George Atkinlson, well know ing it to have been stolen. Hr. Bodkin and Mr WVoollett prosecuted; Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Ballantine defended. It appeared from the evidence that during the October of 1840 thewatch in question and some other property belonng to the prosecutor, a gentleman then living at Blackheath, was stolen. Early in the following year the watch, which had been bought from the shop of Mr. Carter, watch and chronometer maker of Tooley-street, was sent there to be repaired, and, although the name and number had been erased, and also the initials upon the case, it was identified as the one which had been bought for Mrs. Atkinson. It was thereupon stopped and information given to the police, they receiving every assistance from the person who had sent it to be repaired-a Mr. Cameron, baker, in Tooley-street. He had bought the duplicate of the watch, which had been pawned about two months before in the neighbourhood of olden-square by a person named Fletcher, who, it appeared had received it from a Mr. Upton, and the account which he gave of the possession of it was tlis,-he said that he had met the psiseonr, with w;hom he w~as slightly acquainted, and that prisoner had offered to sell him the watch for 91. He (Mr. Upton), not knowing its value, requested that it might be left with him to ascertain its value. This the prisoner agreed to, and Mr. Upton took it to a watchmaker named Fletcher, vho, after 'pledging it, absconded. The prisoner was told of this at the time by Mr. Upton, but he took no steps about the watch. This was within a few days after the robbery had been committed. Mr. lUpton heard nothing more of the matteruntil early in 1841, when an officernamed M'Gill came to him about it, and they together traced prisoner to a publichouse in Leadenhall-market. Upon being taxed with having given the watch to -Mr. Upton, he denied having done so, or that he knew anything about it. Upon these facts he was taken into custody, and committed bytheGreenwichmagiqtrates for trial at these sessions; but being out upon bail absconded. Shortly after that prisoner was known to be in Boulogne, and upon one occasion, being spoken to about coming to England, said, "No, the man is not dead yet." Both the prosecutor and his wife have since died. The prisoner, it wll be remembered, was taken in custody upon suspicion of being concerned in the golddust robbery hut he was sent for trial upon this charge. Although the watch was positively identified as the one sold to Mr. Atkinson, and stolen, the evidence of its being the one which passed from prisoner to Mr. Upton was very obscure.i Mr. CLaRxso.s, in a very able speech, comnmented upon the weak character of the charge, denouncing in the strongest terms the conduct of the prosecutors, who, having failed in one instance to make out any case against the prisoner, raked up a stale charge, hoping no doubt that if convicted upon it they would obtain some information upon another matter which they had a suspicion he was concerned in. The jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty.
iMIDDLESEX SBSSIOVS, Apir 7. The April General Qnalter Sessions commenced this morning at ClerkenweD, before Mr. PASHLEY, Q.C., Assistant-Judge, anda bench of magistrates. There were for trial 67 prisoners charged with felony, and 6 with misdemeanour. A number of cases of larceny were disposed of, the d etails of which were of no public interest.
POLICE. MA?cSIOX-llOUSE.-IWilliam Augustus Fitavililam, a desperate-looking ruffian, supposed to be a ticket-of-leave man, was brought before the LoEr MAYL&Yo by Police-constable Thomas Wright, 670, on a charge of burglariously entering the premises of Mr. Socketts, who carries on the trade of a dairyman in Mitre-square, Aldersgate-street, and, in addition to stealing a bag containing articles of wearing apparel, committing a murderous assault upon a man named Martin, who was left in charge of the house during the hours of Divine service on Sunday evening. T. Dunglison, city constable No. 68, said,-About halfpast 7 o'clock last night I was on duty in Mitre-street. I had just met the constable Wright and passed him when I heard a cry of "Police !" I called him back, and we went to Mlitre-square, where I saw a man named Martin at the first floor window of Mr. Sockett' house calling out "Murder !" I asked hin w.hat -was the matter, and he replied that there were thieves in the house. I said to him, " Come down and open the door." He replied, "I'm afraid." I then told him to come down, and if any one offered to molest him to call out, and I would burst the door open. The man Ic-ft the window, and was coming to open the door. While lie was coming down Isaidto Wright, "I'll just see if there's a possibility of any oneescaping behnd." Iran totheback gate, and on looking through it saw the prisoner running from the direction of MLr. Socketts' house m a yard belonging to the Great Synagogue. I called oat, "Here they a, e," when several of the inhabitants immediately surroundedthe walL IcalledWright fromthedoor andgavehim a leg overthewall, and with the assistanceof several other persons he secured the prisoner. I thei went to the front door, which I found open, and I there found the man who had called from the window, and whose head was covered with blood. Hle told me tbit lie had been beaten by a man with I a candlestick, which I afterwards found on the floor by the fireplace, in the room where I had first seen the man at the window. I then with assistance proceeded to search the rreinses, and in the dustbin of the yard where I saw the prisoner, I found secreted a black ba-, which I produce, containing dirty linen and two penknives. I sent for a doctor, who dressed the man's wounds, and he was then removed homie. The LoPRD Mxox.-TIn what condition is the injured nman? The officer.-He is in a very dangerous state, my Lord, and it is quite impossible that he can be brought here to day to give eviderce. The cleric to M1r. Socketts said-The bag and the other articles which the oflicer has produced are my property I left them vesterday monning in the office of the dairy adjoiingfi the room in which the man was when he callcd out of the window. The coat produced also belongs to me. T. Wright, cons,ahible No. 070, said-About balf-past 7 o'clock lwst night I was on duty in Mfitre-street, when Dhnglison called me, and we both went into the square' I saw a man looking out of the firstfloor window, and callin "Police!" I scaled the vall of the Synagoe-yard, and seized the prisoner. He had no boots on. Isaw his boots against the dusthole in the Synagogue-yard, ancl he pat them on. He then went to the dusthole and pulled out the greatcoat produced and of which Itook charge. After I I bronght him out of the yard the prisoner wanted to carry the coat, but I would not allow hitn. On the way to the stationhouse he said it was a luclcyjob we came along at the tine we did, as if we had not he should havethrown the -man that he hadstuck out of tho window. Ifound thrce cards and lOs. 9'd. on him. The candlestick with which the prisoner had inflicted. the blows upon the head of Martin, and which was very considerably bent, weighed between 51b. and 61b. The prisoner, who exhibited the utmost indifference for the serious offence with which he was charged, was remanded to a future day. GrApLia-MYr. George Delamot, an elderlygentleman, residing at 10, Conduit-terrace, East Greenwich, who described hiunself as an officer on half-pay in Her-Iajestys service, was charged with assaulting the police in the,execution of their duty. Police-constable 224, said, he was going down Newgatestreet about 2 o'clock-, with the relieving force, when the risoner came inthe way of the leading man aid pushed both of them into the road. He told him he ought not to do that as he might get loc3ed up for it, whenhe directly squared up to him and struck him in the nouth. He took him into custody, Police-constable 243, was the leading man of the re3ie force when theprisoner came in his way. He put his hand on hIs shoulder to get bim to move, and said, "Ei you please, Sir," but he immediately struck at witness, who avoided the blow by steppim into the road. He then turned on the other officer and struck him a blow on the mouth. Mr. R. J. Kinder, a bookbinder, residing at Hoxton, stated that he saw the blow given, and interfered to prevent a repetition of it. Mr. Delamot said, he was waking along lew gate-street when some one pushed him sharply in the back, and on turning round the constable said, " Go on, go on, you - rascal," and he then said, " Do you call me a rascal?'` and struck him. He further stated that he was snbject to epileptic fits, and when excited he was not conscious of what he wasabout. He was very much excited at being called a rascal, but he now expressed his regret for what he had done. Police-constable 243 denied that he had used the words attributedto him, or that he hadsaid anything rude to him. Alderman WmE said, if the constable had made use of those words, and the prisoner could prove it, he would take care to report it in the proper quarter, but in the absence of such proof he must prote^t the polce from assaults of this nature. He therefore dined him 5s., or seven days' imaprisonm ent. The fine was paid. WORSMIEP-STRE=T.-A gentleman, whose name was not mentioned, got into the witness-box to make the following application :- The gentleman stated, that while reading the newspapers about 10 days ago he saw an advertisement offering for sale a handsome bay gelding, a thoroughly sound and useful animal, the property of a commercial traveller, and with which a written warranty would be given. This was just the horse he was in want of, and, the reference being to the premises of a liverystable-keeper by the Curtam-road, Shoreditci, he called there to inquire about it, and was at once introduced by the stable-keeper to the so caDed commercial traveUer, who happened to be opportunely present. The horse was trotted out of the stable, and apparently justified the description given of it by the traveller, who stated it to be seven years old,- free from vice, and offered him the warranty. After some conversation and bargaining the nurehase-noney was settled at 271. lOs., of which he agreed to leave 71. as a deposit, on the understanding that he was to have the gelding a month upon trial, and that if it then answered the representations made of it he was to keep it and pay the 201. lOs. balance. This was agreed to by the owner, and he was just maling arrangements for the disposal of the horse, when their conversation was interrupted by a well-dressed man, who hurried in and intimated that he had come to purchase a gelding he had been previously in treaty for. He was told, with some hesitation, that the animal had just thatmoment been sold to the applicant, on wlhich the gentleman expressed great indignation at such a breach of faith, as the sum he had offered for it had been unconditionally accepted, and he had come purposely with the money to talke it away. The owner appeared to be much embarrassed and chagrined at his awkward position, but said he felt bound to adhere to his bargain 'with the applicant, and would therefore still stand by it if he chose to pay the purchase-money down. He was un,willing to lose the horse under such circumstances, and, though he should have much preferred in prudence to have a trial of some sort, he paid the purchase-money and took the horse away. It had only been a few days, however, in his possession when he made the unpleasant discovery that he had been scandalously defrauded, as the animal was not only a great deal more than seven years old, but brokenwinded, and had so many other defects of one Idnd or other as to be perfectly valueless for anything he could put it to. He therefore offered the horse back, and demauded the return of his money, but, though he had made repeated applications of this Idnd, they were all perfectly useless, and, as he could obtain no satisfaction in this way, he had been at length advised to make auplication at this Court, and ascertain whether the liverystable-keeper himself could not be held answerable for the money, which he thought he could for two reasons, first, that the transaction had taken place upon his premises, and, secondly, that he had represented thle ov;ner of the horse to be a commercial traveller and respectable man, whereas he (the applicant) had since ascertained that he was nothing else but a regu,lar horse-coper," as the slang expression was, who had been once before this affairin custodyfor a similar fraud. The magistrate regretted he could be of no service to the applcant: if the facts were as he represented he had been undoubtedly cheated of hismoney,but,taking them even altogether as they were described, they did not, in his opinion, establish sufficient to make out a case of fraudulent conspiracy on the part of the liverystable-keepar, who might have merely, to some extent, acted upon the representations that had been made to him, and the best course, therefore, be thought the appEicant could adopt was to placethe matter at once in the hands of his solicitor. The gentleman thanked the magistrate, and expressed his intention to do so. CLEsr,u'AvELr.-Mr. CosRiPu, the sitting magisrate, requLested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of the remaininghalf of a 51.-note from "CP. A_, and It. from " Tam O'Shanter," for the disabled fisherman Chapman, with a wife and nine children, an aclnowledgment of which was requested in this journal. William loevine, a surgeon, of 14, Arundel-street, Strand, was chargped with being drunlk and assaulting police-constable 50 G in the execution of his duty. It appeared from the evidence that the defendint -went into Sadler's-wells Theatre while the play of Bob Boy was going on, and disturbed the audience in a very ungentlemanly way. He was removed from the house, and asked to have his ioney returned, wEhich wasfetched bythe policen-an, -when ho struck him violently on the face, and caused -his nose to bleed for three-quarters of an hour. AD. ConnRI said, it was a most unjustifiable assault, aud fined the defendant 51., which was paid. TurAnEs.-JuUa Hurley, a"ed 24, and J3ne Bridget Whitmore. aged 22, women of the towrn, wero brougit up before Mr. YA.RDLEy, on remand, charged with stealing a gold pin, value 41. lO., and a silver watch and appendages, from Manuel Perez. Mr. YARDLEY committed the woman Hurley for trial. LA1mEvT.-Thomas Farley, a young man of respectable appearance, was placed at the bar before lMr. E oTyr, and charged on his own confession with embezzling 71., the property of Ihis master. Sergeant Knowler 3 L said, that while on duty at the stationhouse in Kennington-lane on Saturday night, the prisoner came there and said it ws his vwish to give himself up to justice on n charge of embezzling 71., the property ofhis master, Mr. Blogg, a dealer in gold-leaf in the city. The prisoner at the time appeared to be in a state of considerable excitement, so much so as to really require protection, and on that account, as well as from his confession, he felt it to be his duty to detain and takre care of himn. Since then he (Sergeant Itnowfler) had found that his statement wfas true, and that the prisoner had under his charge property to a vast amotunt, but MIr. Blo""C, his employer, wvas at present out of tow n. Si. ELL10TT thought the best course under the circumstances wvould be, to takie the prisoner to the lMansion-house, to he dealt w ith there, as the offence had been committed within the jurisdiction of the lLord Mayor. The prisoner, wvho offered nothing in defence, wvas removed fromn the bar, and taken by the sergeant into the city. j Mr. ELLIOrT mentionied from thme bench the circumstauceI of his having received the halves of tao 101.-notes, for the poorboxm , from ">E C.," the donor stating that on seeing their acknowvledgment in the papers he should sand the remainine halves. The halves were received on the 27th it., and an acknowtledgment appeared on the 29th; yet the remaining halves had not, up to the present, come to hand. A pubLIc notice of the circumstance would, ir. Elliott thought, set the atte right, ad trefore requested our reporter to mention the fact.

CRThBr2AY BOARD OM Nk. p This Beod met yesterday to commeCne its real fimetions. The oultimate certainty of the event h its effect in ttrating a large number of the public, by whom the space allotted to specttors was compley occupied. Anong those presnt were, in addition to many ladies, his Royal Higise the Dake of Cambrige, Lora EDcio, Admiral SirF. L,the Bal ofSheffield, Generalfreeth, Sir I. Airey, Coleesi Gora,, Mr. Ceuwmissary-Geueesl Filder, Colonel Xe;:, Ã¯Â¿Â½Pr, Major- ral Sir Ja Eamilton, &c. We believe neither of the Crimean Commissioners whose report is impugnd was present. The !sile objectionsble arrangemant, which we noticed Sn our enort of Thursday's proceedings, was yesterday entirely.nreoved, bytte very simnle-step of bringing the witmesse? table nearerto the positiontorcupied by the reporters, and;tis change, -oupled with thiEiarl of Lucan's distinct 4nd Ckcided utteance, left no gre-and of complaint. It is hut -common juStice to exprese our great obligations to tColonel Bagot, -Sir J.Wilson,-.anz the officials generally, for ithe courtesy-mad consideratlon with which every Suggefttign has beenmet. The members of the Boar,6entered the hall about a quarIter-pasti '81 Vclock, accoetuaniod by the Judge-Advocate (Mr. Vilier-, M.P.), the soerretary, Colonel Bagot, &c., all 'being in full uniform. Th-ea BnrnsD?rT, in opening the proceedings, impressed upon the audience the necessity of keeping* a, strict silence, -aidrefrunig from aoytoxpressions of admiration or disapprobatio: durin,g the'conrae of the inquiry, and hoped there -would benio interseption of the decorum and good -erder'vdiich ought to-pravail upcon all such occasions. Thune-ux-ADvecsc-ra-Lord Lucan, you stated in a .lte- fth7th of Februzary that you considered you hid ;grounds of com plaintrespecting certain portions of the rejpott'dfthe cominmissieners sent out to inquire into the supplies-of the British-amy in the Crimea'' Siord;Lucan.-Yes. Is that letter before the Board? 'aThe-JuDGE.A_D-scATE.-Yes. Lord Lsc.an.-A nd the answer of the commissioners?7 'The JuDCE-AJXOcOTE.-Yes. Will youir Lordship now ?statelby-what parts of the report you consider your conduct snimadverted upon ; hut before you do so I am directed by 'the-Board to infgrm you that it is not compulsory upon any 'witnnssto diselose any matters which may formu the subject 'eaeharge againlst him- before a court-martial, and that any 'voluntary staterisent- ill be admissible in evidence against lhim. - The-Easl- efikucam--SirA. WToodford, before I go into 'this case tI-wish to put questions to yourself and the general -officers -of this:Board as to whether it is your intention to takeinycase separately, and to decide upon it separately. I conscider that point most essential to my ease, which is in -no dRree-intermixed -..ith that of any other officer. I might -take at for granted. thuat such will be the course adopted, but I-have'recasn-to-suppose that a different phum -say possibly be followed. L can understand that there may be objections aÃ¯Â¿Â½2gaintziag-imm:ediate publicity to the decision of the Board ; lut Ican see no reason why you should not consider and' decide uponit separately, and therefore, if I may be -allowredtte talce sq great a liberty, I w.ould suggest that my -case behtaken-separately, be considered separately, and be -decided&upon separately. It wil then rest entirely with the Bcazd to place its decision in the box upon the table, and keep it-there until the whole inquiry be completed. If that -course be not adopted I anticipate my cause will be seriously ipredimced. ThelTinssIDs;nT {after consultation with the other members of the Court).-It is the opinion of the Board that it 'cannot-take -one '-case separately, and adjudicate upon it separately. That. is our opinion at this stage of the pro*ceeding. Lord:Eucan.-Of- course I must yield to your decision witingreat respect ;- but I would subnmit, with great defer,enee,.although at the same time with all earnestness, thatI iregard as absolutely essential to my case the course I have mentiored. .1 admit if the commissioners had been on -their trial here, and I was preferring charges against them, it -would 'be.fair -to them that all the charges should be ;heard before the case was decided upon; bat I consider -the comniisioners are not on their trial directly, however .mucha interest they may have in this inquiry. I think the person- on trial is myself, and I have nothing to do with any other- officers-who may find themselves in the same unfortunate situation with myself. I think it essential to the justice vf my case that it sbould be considered separately. I have not-called -in the aid of counsel for my xindication, for I thought. it more fair to come forward personally to explain my. cornduct. TXheYPrEsm?r=.-It is theopinionof the Board that cases -cannotl be separately considered. Lord&Lucan.-' Then I must ask for 24 hours' delay to consider-ethetheir I shall go on with my ease. The Ju-nn-AnvocArz.-I am directed by the Board to call your'Lordship's attention to the fact that you have stated'you - consider you have ground of complaint on account of. certain portionss of the report of the commissioners sent to ins:uire into the supplies to the British army in the Crimea; tLat your-Lordship has been called upon to explain to thelBoard-w.hat part of the report it is hi which you consider your conduct animadverted uon; and, being so called upoir to explain, you ask the Board whether they intend to decide-upon-your case separately, and at once, upon hearing 'your. exlanation. Lord LucaaD..zYes. The JuGnn-Anvoct-rn-The Board feels it impossible to -decide.upon your request until it has heard your case. They are-unaware atithis moment in what way you may implicate any- other!parties, or may connect your case with any other cases itumay become the duty of the Board to hear. The -Board carnot'giveyou any definite answer upon this subject-til you-have stated your case. You are now called nwon,-on-your ownadmnission, to ex;plain to the Board what part-df-th commissioners' report it is which you consider annimadvertnsspon your conduct. Lord CLncan. understandthe reas on why the Board declines to- aeedetto my request is that other parties may be implicated-by, it. Itcannot see that, hut at least any person -illhave ar.zhtt comnehereandask tobeheard; anditwould hbe better that-all-such persons should be examined before ~mycse -is. concluded- than at some later period. I have considered this matter deeply, and yesterday I placed mnyself in communication with the Minister of WYaron thesubject. I -come,hereadesiring to show the utmost respect and submis,sion to the Board,tbut not to do whatI conceive to be the sreatest.possible-injastice to my case, or to allow myself hastily or precipitately to enter upon it without having an 'opportunity of 'considering whether I can do so at this monent without prejudice to my interest. I must ask the Boardttoaiow mne 24 hours to consider whether I can go on to-monrrowunder the arrangements proposed. The -JunD.sE-ADvoc,T&r-The Board has stated to you, Lord Lucan, that they -will hear your case first; that your .case has been first-seicted in consequence of your higher milltary rank.; that they-don't know what your case is, and that this inquiry-does not originate with them, but arises from -your requesttotoe allowed an opportunity of making certain .expanatiens. This-opportunity is now, afforded you. You appea r to be undersome misapprehension as to your rights of being heard hereafter. Lord Lucan.-[ -don't wish to come before the Court again. The JSDGZ-AnD-oca. .-If any person here should say anything at anubsequent stage of the proceedings by which your Lordship may consider yourself implicated you will lisa-e the fullest right to come again before the Court. Lord Lucan.-What I-wish is that the Board should decide usponmy case withoutxfirst hearingthat of otherparties. The JrDx:E-XOAkvoa ._-The Board, in the discharge of the duty intrusted to them, cannot receive any directions as to the course which they -will pursue. They sit here to reaeive your explanation, -andihave appointed this day for the purpo=e. Lord Lucau-I thougeht I had guarded myself against oeing supposed to do anything. so improper and unwarrantable as attempting to direct ihe proceedings of the Court. All I intended was to sug est in the most respectful and submissive manner ple what I consider necessary for my ovn vindication. I -do not presume, and I hope I never shall presume, to " direct"' any.one of the General officers who form this Board; but Iatill hope that the Board will give me 24 hours to consider what course I shall pursue. The Board then retired to deliberate, and on their return, at the expiration of about 0 -minutes, The JnDGE-ADvocsrE prooeeded to read the decision of the Court. ie said,-I am-directed to inform you, that if, after the intimation conveyed to you,that your case, lik-e all the other cases whiicls will come before them, will be reported upon to Her Majesty upon its own merits, yourLordship is still of opinion that some idelay is necessary, the Board has agreed to accede to your request. Lord Lucan.-I have only to .express my thanks to the Court for having given their favourable consideration to a point wvhich I conscientiously believe-essential to the proper adjudication of my case. During the absence of the Board from the hall I have considered'theauatter, and I shall not avail myself of the indulgence granted.to me ; but, with permission, I shall expect that there will be no objection on the part of the Board to -my entering a protest against my case not being hneard separa.tely, and I propose, before my case is concluded, to sbmit that that protest be ~-dded to the preceedings of the Court. if the Boar-d see soe objection to the reception of that pgretest, I wiLl, under -eresent circumstanePs-rather than give inconveniencevasive the permission which the Cout has so indu.7gently snanted me, and go on with my cse. - She II,DGE-ADViOCATE.--I amn requested .to inform you: that the Board do not distinctly understand wha.t is meant iWjour statement that your case will not ;oe heard sepamrly'y. It is the intention of the- Court 'to hicar your caae Eeparately. They do not understand, thierefore, to whit your intended protest will refer. Lcd.4 Lucan.-I understand the Board to decide that, thouca they will hear the case separately, they do not feel themr4lves called upon to consider it separately, orto decide upon t'- before entering upon another ease. I maintain most reqpectfully that it is essential to my character as well as to the. ends of justice that my case should not oi4y be taken saarately, but separately adjudicated upon, and separatelg.and finally disposed of. I hare not the least 'wish to prwume to offer any opinion as to when the decigion ,cf the Coen should be made public; unquesi;onably they ,t11 e-xercise,i he right they have to lock up the caSe as long -s-hey may tthink proper; all I seek is to have a final adJjvdication iefore any other case is entered upon. Rather, hov;ever, than Corego this opportunity of giving a public ex-. slanaion of a; conduct I am prepared to submit to what C.coaqqeve to be Ito say the least of it) a very great disad- - vantage. All I ask is to be allowed to pet in my protest aganst a course of groceeding which I think (though I am quite costdent the ieoard has no such intention) can hastily fail to tell-nuch to my prejudice. The ,W-e-rssgADVockpyrE--Lord Lucan, the Board ha.Y already dcidai that the vwill report upon the merits Gf each case s,eptely whet they malke their report to the CDrown, and they will not depart from that rule in your instance. L4ord Lucan.-I am aware that the report will be a separate one, but that doe; not satisfy me. I wish my case to be copidered and decided upon by the Boardc before they tembark ig sny new case whatever. The JUDSA;DVOCATE.-Will you now proceed? The ,4 w tw w4errtadwbatoqv,urIl thvnwj4DbfoW: a@y protest They are not informed what your case is, and can give no other decision than that already arrived at until they have heard your case. lord Lucan-I only wish to save trouble, and amnot desirousof inflicting upon them the inconvenience of an adjournment. The Board has indslgently said it will give me 24 hoxdrs to consider the course I will pursue, and if I can have no intimation that such a protest as I desire to offer wiU be recmived I shall be obliged to avail myself of the indulgence of the Board and to accept the adjournment until to-morrow, when I Will come prepared with a protest to aubmit to their considera)ton. The JUuGE--iDVocAT-The Board cannot come to any other decision. The Court adheres to the offer to grant 24 hours delay in case yov require it, and to its decision to report -separately upon tRhe merits of each case, and they can make mo distinction in sour Lordship's instance. Lord Lucan.-Well, so determined axE I not to give unncessay trouble, that [ will at once proceed; but f shal certainlysubmit a protcstto the Bod, and it will be for then to consider whether they wiU receive it or not. I propose to re& a writtc statement, which will contain those different parts of the report of which I consider I have a right to complais. I askc leave to reserve the power of I changing my mind; hut at present I do not propose to call any witnesses ta 'he examined in chief. I shall, perhap3, have to call frree or four witnesses for a kind of crossexamination npon the evidence they have already given, and, having-Mne that, I shall ask the Board to grant me a few hours in order to prepare an address in which to state to them that which it is -not likely they will learn from the report of te commissioners. The noble Earl then addressed the B3oard as fliows - Sir A. Woodford, my Lords, and Gentlemen,-In obed,ience to your instructions, communicated to me by the SJudge-.Advocate-General, under date the 3d of April, I have the honour to submit for your consideration a statement in writia f the portions of the reportof Sir J. WlTeill and ColonelTulloch which I considertoredlecton me personally during the time wlien I had the honour of being employed with the army in the East, and upon the cavalry, for which as divisional commander, I desire to be held responsible. I cannot deny myself the gratification of premising that I enter upon an exculpation with the most perfect confidence that I sall establish to your entire satisfaction the groundlessness of every charge made by these commissioners, and show that their report, so far as the cavalry is concerned, is not only most unsatisfactory, if not altogether unsupported by evidence, but is totally at variancewith bothfactand truth. Nor do I expect to find it necessary to trespass at any length upon your attention in controverting every line which at aU reflects on the cavalry or on myself. So strong is my conviction that I have the means of removing from the cavalry and from myself the slightest breath of reproach that I must express my anxious desire if I should, against my wish and intention, pass over any sentence which in the slightest degree tells to their prejudice or to my own, you will kindly direct my attention to it, and allow me, what is alone necessary, an opportunitvforitsrefutation. I am not, I trust, too sanguine when I express a hope and expectation that I shal succeed in convincing you, not alone that any loss of horses cannot justly be charged upon myself or upon the cavalry officers generally, but that, on the contrary, we did all in our power to mitigate it, but which, nnhappily, under the circumstances in which we w.ere placed and the orders to which we owed submission, proved entirely beyond our control. Immediately upon t is report appearing I addressed to the Minister of War a letter, which I presume is before the Board, and a copy of the commissioners' answver was transmitted to ne about ten days ago, which I preswne is also before the Board. It appears to me that their letter is no answer at all, but a reiteration of the errors, mis-statements, and fallacies contained in their report, and to which they are so determined to adhere with apertinacity which camnot inthe end tend to do them much honour. '1hcir answer contained one passage which I should wish not to leave unnoticed. The cosmmissioners take upon them to say that Lord Lucan's examination in regard to commissariat supplies would not, it is believed, br.ag out any infonnation of any public importance. U pon what that belief is founded they do not say. I will only observe that, with respect to the commissioners, I should think I might be allowed to be the best judge of the importance of the information I myself possess. That the commissioners should be still satisfied vith their report may, indeed, s rise me; but it is no matter of surprise that they should not recoinuiend any further inq - As I have already said, their reply is no answer to myyletter, and I shall not have to give it any furtherattention. I shall take the points as they arise in the report. My fint objection is to the conclusion arrived at at page 20, as to the deaths of the cavalry horses, and as to that conclusion I take it those gentlemen have misrepresented. It is said, proceeded the noble Earl, " in the report, -and I am obliged to take the commissioners' figures, as I have nothing to refer to to tell me the strength of the regiments at that particular time,-they say, taking the sLX months from October to March, such was the strength of the cavalry, but it is right I should observe that on the 1st of October there was no Heavy Cavalry in the Crimea. My object is solely to show the incorrectness of these commissioners. It is not whether this report wil tell to their disadvantage, but to show that whenever they treat of the cavalry they are unfortunately always in error. They say the Heavy Cavalry in the Crimea from the 1st of October amounted to 1,0S5 horses. They say 493 died (I am obliged to accept their figures), and they say 47 per cent. died in siX months. If you will refer to page 193 of the A poendix you will sec the commissioners return the number of horses belonging to the Heavy Brigade as 1,055, and 83 of them were kiled in action or transferred to other corps. There. fore you must calculate your casualties upon those that remained-972. If it be true, as they say, that 493 horses died from disease, deducting that number from 972 leaves 479, and that, I believe, instead of being, as the commissiners state, 47 per cent., it must be more than 50 per cent. The error has been that they have considered every horse kiled in action as if he had died of disease subsequently. In the Light Dragoons, which lost more horses in action, the error is of course more decided. In that brigade there were 1,161 horses, of which 489 were either transferred to other corps or died in consequence of wounds. Of course, you must deduct that number before arriving at any estimate, and then, deducting from the 672 remaining the 439 which died from disease, yon will find the deaths reached rather 65 per cent. than 38, as the commissioners say. Sir G. BEPzauEY.-The Heavy Brigade on the 1st of October numbered 1,055 horses; the Light Brigace, 1,161, mnaking together 2,210. There died from disease 493 in the He.avy Brigade, and 439 in the Light Brigade, making a total of 932, which I make to be 42 per cent. Lord Lucan.-But what I object to is the calculation of the commissioners as seParate calculations for each brigade, and the Board must confine themselves to those calculations. I show that in the Light Cavalry the deaths, instead of being what they say-47 per cent.-were more than 50 per cent.; and in the Heavy, instead of 38 per cent., were 65 per cent. I only wish to show the figures of the commissioners are wrong. In page 21 there are the comparative losses of the commissariat and the cavalry horses. In referring to the losses sustained by the commissariat animals during the same period, the deaths. according to the return of the Deputy-Commissary-General, amounted to 889, out of 2,329 animals originaly landed in the Crimea-a proportion of 38 per cent.-"a result which could scarcelv have been expected, considering the advantages which cavalry horses might naturaly be su posed to have over hard-worked baggage animals, to which little attention could be paid at such a Period." Now, if I have satisfied the Board that, instead of 38, itwas 65 per cent., you will naturally sayI am damaging my own case. But the commissioners have been so wonderfully wrong that I can afford to state the truth. I have great difficulty in arguing this case very accurately, and probably the Board will he obliged to call for returms which I am unable to fumish, in order to thoroughly sift and investigate this matter. There is one thingwhich, onthe face of the report, must strikethe Board .at once. The commissioners enter into a comparison of the losses of transport animals and of the cavalryhorses, with a view of disparaging the cavalry. I think the Board will admit that for such a comparison to be fairly made they must place the horses of both services on the same footing. lf they take the losses of the cavalry as beginmlg on the 1st of October and ending on the 1st of MIarch, then the transport animals should equally have been in the Crimea during that period. But when I am prepared to show you that of these 2,329 horses not one-half can have been in the Criniea at all until subsequent to the month of February, then I submit it is a monstrous thing to say that horses freshly imported at a tume when they could be well housed and -well fed are to be compared with the cavalry, which had to undergo all the bar ships of the preceding months. Such a comparison, I think, approaches very nearly to an absurdity. I have no means of stating to the Court the exact number of commissariat animals at the different periods referred to; but I believe there will be sufficient to convince the Court that the commissioners have committed the grossest mistake which two gentlemen ever fell into. The first return I find is one,.No. 9 in the Appendix, page 66, whiclh purports to be a " General Return of Transport employed for the Service of the British Army in the Crimea.- January 16, 1855.'? By referring to this return you will find that it not only furnishes an account of the transport services that were with the depOts, but that it purports to give the number of other baggrage animals which were with the different corps, or in the rimea at all, on the 16th of January. You will see that the gross number of effective animials on that day was 333. and that'at the same date there were 171 non-effectives, making a total of 503 animals living on the 16th of January in the Crimea. If you have made yourselves acquainted with that return I wish you then to be good enough to refer to page 69 in the Appendix. The table there marked No. 11 is supposed to show the horses received and issued by .a commissariat officer between December 16, 1854, and what animals remain on the 11th of January, 1855, or only five days preceding the other return. You vill find that by diiferent transports theyreceived 435 horses, and they admit to havealso received from Eupatoria 281 horses. In passing, I wish the Board to take a note of this point,nanaly, that I believe the figures 281 to be quite erroneous. I was.wert.ainly told at the time that there were 600 or 700 horses bought, not by Mr. Filder, but by Lord Raglan's direct eier, through lMlr. Stockley, a veterinary surgeon. Perhaps they may not all have arrived at this time, which w ould acaicunt for the discrepancy; but, instead of 281, I believe t;e number of horses received from Eupatoria was 600 or 700. Taking the return as it stands, however, this makes 716 horses. Now, I wish the fBoard to recollect (and this is rather a complicated question), thS-i 716 is not the number of horses tikat happened to have been in the Crimea on thel1th of January, but the number of horses landed- in the Crime% between the 16th of December and the 11th of January, sa that &very horse wliich landed with the army in September, and between that date and December16, is not included in this number. On the 11th of January there only remained 513 out of the 716 homses landed since the 16th of the previous month (without taking into account the horses previously imported), and it follows therefore that the whaJe transport of the army, up to December 16, and 293 hora subsequetly imported had all disappeared. I have stated to the Board that I have no means of arriving at the exact number there was in the Crimea, but Mr. Filder's evidence, I think, will tell you that 70 horses were landed with the army and I believe he will also teU you that 200 .wvmv landg4 atimuds ; and it is l0toliom-at least to all those who were connected with the service in the Crimeathat horsst were landed between the Ist of September and the 16th of December. Of those horses I have no return. I can only repeat that they had all disappeared on the 11lt of January, with 203 of those landed in the previous month. Takdai just that month, and supposing there to be no other horses witn the commiss0r1t,theyactually lost in oce month 30 per cent, of the horses which appear on the fwe of the hoks, in addition to wshat their losses may have been of horses previously imported. Now, when this companison is entered into-and most invidiously entered intoifor the purpose ofcating discredit on the cavalry it must be recollected that when that force lost their horses it was when they were exposed to all the inclemency of the weather, in the wettest months we had during the whole campaign, and that they were placed under circumstances lof thegreatest difficulty. I have a return on the subject 'which is not quite so accurate as I could wish; but the act is I find in a campaign it is very difficult to exact from officers very strict returns. Recollect, I am bringing no charge against Mr. Filder - it is notnecessary I should do so. My only wish isto show that there were no grounds for disparsgng the cavalry. Mr. Filder, in his examination, says be took good care that his baggage animals should be fed before the other animals of the army. I thank him for that admission. He says he took care that if there was anything to eat his own animals should have it. [General PEEL.-Att what page does that statement occur?] I think it is in his first evidence. The fact is that these horses were fed in preference -to the other horses of the army. It will be, perhaps, worth noticing here that I suspect-I am obliged to eak in this loose way because I have not those returns or which I hope this Board will call-that among the transport are included the ambulance animals.and thereforeyoumust suppose those arimnals to have perished with them. I submit to the Board that they should ask for a return of the amount or baggage and ambulance animals on the first of every month durinn the six months which these commissioners refer to. They wil then see how far they can compare the one with the other;. but surely it is monstrous to say that because of 1,000 animalIs which may have been landed in the Crimea in February all were not dead they therefore took better care of their horses than we did-we who had to undergo all the difficulties, privations, and exposure of the worst part of the year. There is another point which adds to the injustice of such a comparison. Lord Raglan, on the 20th of January, asked me, as commanding officer of the ca-valry, to furnish cavalry officers and non-commissioned officers to look after shiploias of something like 270 mules; and I think I may say confidently that, after having had them in charge from the 20th of January to February 13, when I left the almy, I succeeded in preserving every one of those animals-which are now brought against me to show that I neglected my own cavalry,becausethese animals did not die like the rest! These 270 mules, as I have said, were given up to officers and non-commissioned officers of the cavalry, and were left in perfect condition when I quitted the Crimes. Well, I think I have said enough to satisfy the Court that it is difficult to enter into any fair comparison, but that if this is to be done, instead of the losses oftransportanimals being less, theywere very, very much more than the losses of the cavalry. I think, therefore, I was justified insayingin my letter that it was notorious in the army that the losses in the transport and in the ambulance far exceeded those in the cavalry. I shall now go on to the next point. - Until nowI really might say I havebad to deal only with figures and calculations which I hope I have succeeded in showing aTe exceedingly wrong. I now come to facts, and I think I might say here, what has been wittily said on another occasion, that there is nothing so incorrect as the figures of these comr misaconers except their facts. In page 30, under the head of what is called "Shelter for Horses," they state:-"The date at which the hutting of the cavalry commenced was in no case earlier thanthe end of January or beginning of February." Now, the Light Cavalry Brigade marched to Xadikoi, or rather to a valley in the neighbourhood of Xadikoi, on the 2d of December. The weather was so extremely bad that the Heavy Cavalry were only able to remove on the 5th. On the 6th I issued the following divisional order-- "Head-quarters, Cavalry Division, Kadikoi, Dec. 5, 1S54. "The Lieutenant-General desires that all the public baggage-animals, including the forge-cart mules, be assembled for the purpose of carrying the materials to be used in the construction of the stabling. Commanding officers will therefore inform the Deputy-AssistantQuartermaster-General by 4 o'clock this afternoon how many are in possession of each regiment, to enable the Lieutenant-General to make provision for their care. It is wished that they should be well marked, that at the end of this service no confusion may take place in their restoration to their regiments." The HeavyCavalrymarched on the 5th, and there is some stir, you see, made on the same afternoon. It will be obvious to you, gentlemen, that -the construction of stabling of that sort was perfectly novel to myself; and I may say that there was not an individual belonging to the cavalry who had ever seen such horse stabling; and, if they had not experience themselves, they were not likely to get it from our allies, -who not only had not then hutted their horses, but had not hutted one when I left the army on the 13th of February. I believe I shall be able also to satisfy the Board that at this time no engineer officer had been given to me at all; that when we were on the heights I had two visits from two officers, but that I had no assistance from any engineer officer up to the present time. On the 4th of December I received a letter signed by Captain Bourchier, BrigadeMajor of the Engineer Corps, notifying to me that I was to have the assistance of an engineer officer, Lieutenant Lennox, who was specially appointed for the purpose of superintending the construction of the cavalry stabling, and was "to remain at Lord Lucan's headquarters for the period mentioned by his Lordship." That letter is dated December 4. I cannot recollect the exact period Linentioned, but I am quite satisfied it was a very short one, for I knew the great difficulty there was in getting any assistance from the engineers at that moment. When, however, Lieutenant Lennox arrived I certainly did fatter myself that I had succeeded in getting what I had been entreating-I don't know what sufficiently strong word I can make use of-what I had been making daily applications for during nearly three weeks previous. Lieutenant Lennox, however, passed one hour with me. He then said that he would return next day, and begin operations, butIneversawhim from that hour to this, and I was then told that no officer of the Engineer Corps would come at all; but that a Major Hall, belonging to the East India Establishment, had been placed on the Staff of our army, and would superintend the construction of these stables. I again flattered myself that I was going to have the constant attention of an engineer officer. But Mlajor Hall, after some days, called upon me, and told me that he would give me any assistasice and advice in his power, but that the cavalry stables formed a very small part of his duty, and that he would be fully occupied in Balaklava, where he had to build piers and stores, and, in short, do nearly everything, except build stables for the cavalry. It is right I should here observe that the great difficulty as to the construction of stables for cavalry was that the men were very sickly, and I will show you later there were scarcely men enough to take care of the horses, much less to build stables. I therefore requested of the Quartermaster. General that I might have some Turks to assist in the construction of stables. The Quartermaster-General seemed always anxious to give me that assistance; and indeed he did give me the assistance of an engineer offlcer, for, although I did not get him, the QuartermasterGeneral ordered bim to come to me. So it was with regard to these Turks. He ordered them, but I did not get them. So long as we were on the hills I was to get the Turks from Sir Colin Campbell, who, I believe, had very good reasons for what he did; but, after sending my aidere-camp every day at the same hour before we removed to Kadikoi, we did not get a single onc. I am now about to speak from a journal kept by my son, Lord Bingham, my aide-de-camp, which appears to have been very accurately kept. It must he recollected that the Light Cavalry moved down on the 2d of December, and the Heavy Cavalry onthe 5th. Lord Bingham says in his journal, December 2:-"Came down to Sir Colin Campbell to ask about Osman Pasha" (who commanded the Turks); on December 3 he sawv Osman Pasha, but not being quite satisfied with the message he sent I went down myself. " Lord Lucan called on Osman Pasha, but the Turks and huts had not then arrived." On the 4th of December I called on Osman Pasha, who promised most faithfully I should have the Turks the next day, and referred me to roostum Pasha, who was the biigadier-general commanding at Balaklava. I see Lord Bingham was sent the next day to Roostum Pasha to get the Turks. On the 6th General Airey-sent an aide-de-camp to me ostensibly for the purpose of inquiring how we were getting on with the stabling. I told him the exact difficulty we were in, being bandied about between Sir C. Campbell, Osman Pasha, and Roostum Pasha, and that we could get no assistance. The ne.xt day I wrote to the Quartermaster-General, and stated the whole difficulty. I think you will see that from the 2d to the 7th something was done, although no progress was made. On the 8th Lord Bingham again went to fRustum Basha, and on the 10th I assembled nil the commanding officers of regiments and discussed with them the propriety of coming to some arrangement by which the regiments could be better supplied with neceasanes in the field; and we also discussed this very question of the huts, and I asked whether they would prefer remaining where they were, or whether we should move a little nearer? fRustum Basha was at last induced to give us a few Turks, Ihbe]ieve something like 100 or at most 150, and on December the 21st I wrote this letter to the Quartermaster-General: " Cavalry Head-quarters, Dec. 21, 1854 "Sir,-I find myself again compelled to request youlr attention to the great difficulties I experience in the construction of the stabling for the troop horses. Employed as every dragoon is at this time in regimental duties, I can receive no assistance from them, and all Turkish assistance is altogether witnheld. Having by your direction applied to Osman Pasha for Turkish soldiers, he gave an order to Roostum Pasha to give me all the men I might require. He then refused to send any more without a positive order from Sir Colin Campbell, who, I am sorry to state, has informed me that he La unable to send any Turks to aid in this operation, in consequence of the numbers already employed on different fatigue duties. "In consequence of being thus deprived of the Turkisl soldiers, the masons belonging to the division are oblied to wait nuon themselves, thus rendering the work slow and costly. lhe disappointment I experience is most annoying, as I am satisfied that the stabling will not be constructel to an extent or in time to be of much use to the cavalry homes. "I have the honour, &c., "LUCAN, Lieuterant-General " Commanding Cavalry Division. "The -Quartermaster-GeneraL" The first thing I did was to take every artificer from the regiments to begin at once the construction of stables-not at head-quarters of regiments, for this reason-it wadecided that the most expeditious and readiest mode of affording covaring for the horses would be to erect stabling atthedepotwhichhad been placed at Kadikoi. In that plan there were many advantages. The depot was one mile nearer to the stores than the head-quaters of the regiments. there Wa'S more wvood to assist in the construction of stables, and, with our s powes of transport, we could make twice the number of journeys to the tiUiber Bwxt that wc v91d havgs d they SQt b0ea4. qarterm Therefore, it was the momentthe cavatyarrived there I made them give over all their artificers-which I am sorry to say were very few-to %he engineer officer and the corporal of Sappers, an excellent man, who was given to me, andL we began the construction of stables, I think, on the 6th of December, and never discontinued worling until they were completed. How this depOt, -with stabling for 200 or 300 horses, eseaped the attention of the commissioners I cannot imagine. But they choose to say the construction of stAbling had not commenced at all, because they trace in the evidence of some regimental officers that it had not comsneneed with them at head-quartersof the regiments. I am free to admit that in the regiments that were most distant the stabling was not begun, but all I say is, I am prepared to show to the board that every endeavour, every effort that could be made to promote the construction of stabling was made; that not an hour was lost; thatit was commenced before the troops took up winter quarters; that it was superintended by myself, and was carrned on by everyofficer m a manner which, I must say, deserved encouragement and not disparagemeut. I am prepared to show, by my orders-I have no other means of proof-that so far from not beginning until January, I will produce orders which will show that at that time they were expected to be completed in a few days. General PEEL.-Were the stables at the depot to be for all the cavalry at head-quarters ?L Lord Lucan.-No; only for some 20 or 300. In an order of the 27th of January I said "Cavalry Camp, Head-quarters, Jan. 29, 1855. "The Lienltenant-General directs that when a hospital hut has been carried for each regiment the whole attention of commanding-officers may be devoted to the drawing of timber for completing the huttingof horses, which Lord Lucan considers should be done within a few days. "By order, "C. c. SHUTE, ,Mjor, .A.C." This is the very period the commissioners say we were only commencing the building of our stabling. I have referred to my order of the oth of 13ecember about the bgage. horses, and here is an order of the 16th of December: *- " Cavalry Camp, Head-quarters, Dec. 16, 1854 "It is quite evident, from the difficulty of getting a sufficdent number of Turks and the little wvork that can be got out of them, that, unless we can make stabling for ourselves, we shall be 'ithout, which cannot failto be attended by the fearful consequence of our becoming altogether dismounted. The ground for the stabEing is already marked out; the regiments are in possesion of a certain number of intrenching tools, and, if required, more shall be given them. The Lieutenant-General does entreat commanding officers to endeavour by every means in their power to give shelter to their horses. Lord Lucan conceives that they could readily scarp away in their front, and pave under their horses' feet, and he will anxiously watch the progress of the wrk "By order, "C. C. SEITE, Major, A.A.C." Before that day Lord Raglan bad caled upon me to give him 500 effective horses for the transport service of the army. It was not possible to fmd that number of effective horses, and at the same time to furnish sufficient number for their own foraging. Thus the board will readily perceive *h.t the last order meant. The carriage of timber being necessarily stopDed, all I could do was to entreat commanding officers to scarp away the earth, and mak-e as comfortable shelter for the horses as they could. It wiU be remembered that when the Light Cavalry came down they were not in a position to do much for a few days. I wi=l show you thlat from that date (the 12th of December to the 1Sth) every effective horse was required for thne transport, and after, with difflculty, saving horses for our own forage,wve had none left for any other service. I have already read myIletter of the 21st of December to the QuartermasterGeneral. I have not his reply, but here is my letter of the 22d in answrer to it:*- " Balal;ava, Dec. 22, 1854. "Sir,-Your letter of the 20th inst., received yesterday, informed me that 200 Turkish soldiers would be sent and placed under my command this morning, and instructed me, as I understood, to-select a spot in the neighbourhood of the works to be carried on for their encamument. This I immediately arranged with the Assistant:Quartermaster-General. did not understand that I was to advise you of my having done so. From the absence of Lieutenant-Colonel lWayow I am unable at this moment to refer to your letter. I have received information from Sir Colin Campbell that I le has selected a body of Turks already encamped close by, snd recommending that I should allow them to continue there. This I purpose to do, as I cannot see that it wil be inconvenient. Should it, however, prove so, they can be removed. I hope and expect to have the Turks at work tomorrow. "I have the honour, &a., "LUCAN, Lieutenant-General, i Commanding Cavalry Division. "The Quartermaster-GeneraL" I think I have shown that the Quartermaster-General did all he could to render me the assistance of Turks. The largest number we ever got to work was 150, and at that time there was the dreadful mortality among the Turks. The number dimindmished to one-half or one-third, and the survivors were in so fearful a condition that Sir C. Campbell appealed to my hunanity to release the Turks, already En ext-emnir, from the necessity of working for us, to whichil consented. I am satisfied that the stabling and the buttingt at what I call the depot were completed on the Saturday preceding the 17th of January. I should inform the Board, with regard to these huts, that as soon as one was roofed the horses from some regiment were sent in to occupv it. This went on until the 14th ef the month. Then I thought, when the stabling had been completed; that the most convenient course would be to move the 17th Lancers, andmnake them occupy that stabling, which they did; and if you refer to the evidence of Major Benson you will find that on the 16th of the month the 17th Regiment had been all hutted, and that the hutting had been built by Lord Lucan. I should state, also, that, on the 16th of the month, the commanding offlcer having stated that they could do nothing at searping, I thought I would satisfy myself of what they could or could not do, so I called for a nominal return from each regiment of how each man was employed the day before. I have these returns here, and I don't know how any divisional officer could do more. I may, perhaps, mention what happened with regard to the retura transmitted from the 4th Dragoon Guards. By mistake the return from this regiment was addressed to Lord Raglan instead of to Lord Lucan. Lord Raglan read the return and said, "Well, I am very glad to see the men were all so well employed." I only mention this to show that on the day I refer to there was not a single man who was not eitheron regimental or on public duty. Again; I consider it right to tell yon that about the middle of January, thinking there was not as much expedition as there might have been, I made one of the brigades (though rather to prevent than to complain of any inactivity) report the number of horses given shelter to during the week, and the other reported every morning the progress of the day before. The commissioners, in their letter rePlying to mine, rely upon Colonel Doherty's evidence, and state that the stabling was not completed before February 23. The board will perhaps recollect that I state in my letter to the Minister of War that, instead of only completing the stables in the middle of March, " the 800 horses of which the cavalry then consisted were every one of them stabled on thellth of February." I was speakingthen very much from recollection, and I will just state why I think I could not have been very wrong. When I embarked on the 13th of February, my Adjutant-General, Colonel Shute, taking leave of me, offered his congratulations that I was not leaving the army with one horse that was not under shelter. That was the last thing he said to me. On the 11th of February, visiting the camp of the 8th Hussars to see how their stabling was constructed, I found the carpenters were stiUl working on the roof, and I complained that it was not finished, as they promised, the night before. Upon this they said that the whole of the horses had been taken in the night before and had received a temporary shelter, and that by the next day all would be completed. This was on the 11th, and therefore I say boldly that every horse of the cavalry, 792 in number, were at that time butted and sheltered. 'he commissioners rely very much on Colonel Ddherty's evidence. Now, I do not propose to call any witnesses at all, but I do propose cross-examining three or four officers to show that they have-unintentionaUy, Iam sure-stated what is not quite correct. If Colonel Doherty is here I shall be glad to examine him. Lieutenant-Colonel BAGOT said, Colonel Doherty hadbeen -present, but was not now in court. The Inspector of Police called the witness by name, but no answer was made to the summons. Lord Llucan.-It is not very important. I only wished to show that Colonel Doherty was speaking loosely, and did not know exactly what he was saying. I think I have now shown that, at all events, there was no great want of eneg displayed in hutting these horses. I have shown that there was very great difficulty in the carriage of the materials, in consequence of the horses being emluoyed in the transport of the army; and that there was ao great difficulty in proceeding with the 'work in consequence of there being no men and very few Turks to assist. There wery also great difficulties with regard to the timber. The board will recollect I am confining myself entirely to the hutting after we came down from the heights. The table at page 34 of the report will show you the date of tbe arrival of the timber, and of what the various carToes of timber consisted; and 1 wish you to observe that, although at the beginning of December there was no great scarcity of planking, there was a very great scarcity of the scantling required for uprights and roofs. (Having referred to the cargoes in question his Lordship proceeded.) I should state here that when on the 5th of December the bamegase animals collected for the purpose of carrying this tirber went to the stores, they were told it was not regular, that we were not armed with sufficient authority, that there was no order from the Commanding Engineer, and that therefore nothing could be done. I therefore vrote to the QuartermasterGeneral, desiring that a discretionary power should be given to me, and that on my requisition these stores should be issued. I was told that that again would be irregular, but, after Major Hall was stationed at Balaklava, I am bound to say there was no difficulty whatever in obtaining anything that was there. Nothing in the shape of unnecessary forms was required, and if Major Hall had the timber he always gave it. Another difficulty delayed us three or four days-namely, the want of nails. After our roof was ready it was discovered that no nails had been provided, and it was necessary to wait until the arrival of nails from Constantinople. I must say that, instead of the stabling having been completed on the 11th of February, it might have been finished two or three weeks earlier but for these delays, and for the want of scantling for uprights and rafters. But I wish now to refer to a letter I addressed to Lord Raglan on the 17th of January. Itis as follows:- " Cavalry Camp, Xadikoi, Jan. 17, 155. "Sir,-It is 'with much regret that I find myself again compelled to represent the fearful consequences to the cavalry of having to continue in the discharge of transport duties, and to make another appeal in their behalf to the Field-Marshal. " The horses continue dying fast; the discipline and economical management of the regiments deteriorate - feelings of disappointnient and dissatisfaction are felt by the officers commanding brigades, regiments, axid others; and, in addition, this army is losing a cavalry it will be difficult to replace, while the country is suffering an enormous and, in my opinion, needless pecniiary loss. " Since the 12th of December, when the cavalry were first pp4de to give con4idsigyl4 transport, no less than 426 bor e5 have died, many daily ining under their load, and then left helplessly by the way to perish The mortality and sickness areindeed,6ogreat thlt=M less Tetegimet are nie.., quickly of these duties, a suficienu of horses will not survive to forage for the aick and wealy, and the whole must starve or be destroyed; while a cesaation of these duties, with great care and nursing, might yet, in my opinion, save 400 or 5, or more. When the commissariat duties were first given to the cavalry I indulged in the confident expectation that it ws an extreme temporary measure to meet an extraordinary unforeseen difficulty in provisioning the infantry, not kely to last beyond a few days; but ithas now continued above five weeks, and, however bad the stati of theroads and weather, without the intermission of a single day, and sometimes when the provisions carried were not for immediate use, but taken tothe front t be stored, and during this time baggage animals have been landed200 or 300 at a time, to an aggregateamount, I shonld suppose, of thousands, without any apparentintention of releving the cavalry of these onerous duties. "Independent of the loss to the anny of so important a branch of the service, the pecumary lows to the country from the destraction of so miny horses is enormous. Ifuch above 400 are gone already;- as many more mazy be expected to g; 80horss iill have been worth 60,0001., andI wish to a the attention of the Eield-3Iar6hal to the fact that whereas a troop horse is worth 754, baggage ponies can be procured in Asia Minor and elsewhere uat S. a-head to any amount; and as the pony carries on a pack-saddle two bags of biscuit, a load re(uiring four troop horses, two to ride and two to Arry, te pon costing 5L, is equal to a transport power from troop horses of 3001. The saddlery, t0mn improper use, constant exposure to the weather, without the means or time for giving it proper care, is suffering severely; the discipline and economical arrangements or the regiments are suffering from the fact that the men, leaving camp early in the morning, and or.lyreturning late in the afternoon, are scarcely ever seen by their troop oficers; the whole of the messing is deranged; and it is found impossible to hold any parades, or have any inspections whatever; and further, from the great number of menemployedin thisay and inforaginge it isnotpossible to make much progress in the butthng of the horses, by which they a,gain have to suffer; for I cannot doubt that, hut for this constant occupation of the cavalry, the butting would ere this have been completed and the horses all under cover. "HSaving nowv stated the dreadfulliosses, and explained the many inconveniences consequent on the cavalry acting as commissariat tranports, I must not withhold from his Excellency the great disappointments-I might add the great dissatisfaction-felt by the offniers commanding brigades, regiments, and, indeeA, by the officers geneally, at the long continuance, and without any apparent early termination, of duties so totally foreign to their profession. In the beginning they-were hurt at being told that these duties -weregiven them inconsequence of their havingno field duties to perform-theynowflndthat theyarebecomingra i-dly dismounted, 1an that their inefficiency will be complete, when they can consequentlynolongerlookforthat honeur able service and distinction in the field vhich:was the ambition of all, and with many -were the sole inducements to undergo the hardship and privations of the campaign. They, again, feel that, though having profited of an oppor-unity which has not yet offered itself to the French cavalry, of distinguishing themselves against the enemy, still they find themselves humiliated in the eyes of those allies by having to discharge duties strange to cavalry. Such feelings the Field-Marshal will not,I am sure, think discreditable or improper; but, I trust, deserving of indulgent consideration. " %ith every desire to obey every order and carry out every wish expressed by his Excellency, I find myself com- elled, as aIieutenant-General in this army, and responsible rthe efliciency of the cavalry, to ly these facts before him, and to eXPreSS my hope that he will be disposed to relieve my divisien from duties onerous and destructive, and which from their nature are so distasteful that they cannot fail seriouslyto lessen that zeal and that esp,-U de corps -which are so essential, and whici uquestionably it is always an object to promote. I have the honour, &c., "LUCAN, Lieutenant-General, Commanding Cavalry Division. "The Adjutant-GeneraL".- I read this letter to show that the transport duty. besides depriving us of horses, prevented our constructing in January stables which were only coiunleted in February, and I think I have shown that the stables were commenced before the end of January. As to its termipation, the commissioners now state that there had been a misprint, and that they never intended to refer to horses, but only to men. I say the construction of cavalry stables was commenced in December. The commissioners state now there " has been a misconception as to date" (unfortunate word, -which seems to haunt them), "forwhich hisLordshipisnot responsible." But -when -we consider that one of these commissioners was a Poor Law Commissioner, therefore in the habit of dealing with statistics, and the other the statistical clerk of the War-office, we might expect a little more accuracy. They now say it was " the accidental displacement of the words 'shelter for horses' in the margin which has given Lord Lucan the trouble of disproving what was never intended;" the unfortunate consequence of the error has been that they not only deceived Lord Lucan, but have brought down upon me great obloquy during the last six weeks. As to the men, I will come to that later on, but I think the evidence of Colonel Doherty will disappoint the comnmissioners if they expect it to support their report. The report speaks of one regiment as being within one mile of the stores, but they are as incorrect in their distances as their other facts. In no instance were the head-quarters of regiments nearer than two miles from the depots. The report goes on,-" Where wood could be obtained with no trench -work, and the only work was to carry up their own forage, and occasionally furnishing parties to carry sick and provisions to the front." Now, on the 12th of December came the order to furnish 500 horses, and I consulted the officers how the order could be complied with in the manner least destructive to the horses. The Light Cavalry horses were in the worst condition (but I guard myself against imputing any blame on that account to its officers), and I called upon the Heavy Brigade to furnish the whole 50, leaving the Lighlt Brigade to do the foraging and furnish the picket. Ulpon the 22d of D'ecember G~eneralScarlett wrote:- "Camp, adikoi Dec. 22, 1854. "MyLord,-Ihave withregretthehonour to call your attention to the number of sick horses and the daily deaths of from four to five horses in theregimentsin my brigade. " This decrease of effective horses is so rapid that some of the,regiments will be unable to furnish the required number of pack-horses and draw their own forage, wvhen it becomes their turn to give the icket. " The improvement which had taken place since the horses came to a more sheltered spot has within the last 12 days ceased to be visible. Many are becoming affectedwith diseases of the lungs, &c., which end in glanders. The cavalry when they came down here were in a state that required care and grooming to renovate and restore them to condition. "They are now employed six hours per diem in carrying provisions of forage, which leaves the men few hours of daylight to groom and clean arms and appointments in such -weather as this, and leaves no possibility of proceeding with hutting or building stables. " It is for your Lordship to consider whether the cavalry can perform their present duties and also retain any chance of doing effective service in the field when called on, now or at any future period. It may be for the good of the service generally that they should perform their present duties, but it can scarcely be relied on that they will also be effective as cavalry at a future period. " There has been latterly no deficiency of forage, but many horses are off their feed from debility and low fever, contracted from long exposure, and are unfit for -work in consequence. " I wish, lastly, to advert to the want of Teterinary medicines, for which applications have been sent iu. " I have the honour, &c., "J. YORKE SCARLETT, Brig.-Gen. "Lieut.-Gen. the Earl of Lucan, &c." Upon the 23d I wrote to the Adjutant-General:- "K Kadikoi, Dec. 23, 154. "Sir,-I consider it my duty not to withold from the Field-Marshal the enclosed letters from Brigadier-General Scarlett, commanding the Heavy Brigade in` the Cavalry Divion. "Like the Brigadier-General, I feel keenly and with the deepest regret the serious losses of horses occurring dailyin the different regiments of cavalry, occasioned, as they are, by their carrying up provisions to the front of the army-a labour occupying many hours in the very bad state of the roads, and with their own reduced condition far beyond the power of these animals. So many have died, and so many more have falen sick, that it is not even found possible with this duty for these regiments to forage for themselves ; the 5th Dragoon Giiards, incousequence, only drew part of their allowance yesterday. " I feel that I ought not to conceal from his Excellency that on the part of the Brigadier-General and the officers commanding regiments a strong feeling exists that their regiments will become altogether dismounted, and that, in the total inefficiency of their regiments for any service in the field, their owvn characters will become compromised,-a feeling -which, from the situation I hold, I must more than share. " These officers have all expressed to me their desire to endeavour in the provisioning of the infantry to give all the assistance in their power, but, from the long continuance of this onerous duty, they areapprehendimg the most serious consequences. "LUCAN, Lieutenant-General, "Commanding Cavalry -Division. " The Adjutant-General." I received as an answer this memorandum:- [MEMOnLummnss.] "Lord aglancan frm no"Dec. 24, 1854. opinion on this matter without knowving hovv many horses are employed in carrying provisions to the troops, how many in fetching forage for themselves, and hovv many are left at home. "ESTCURTA.G." Now I wish the hoard to bear in mind that hile the commissioners talk of our only having occasionaly to bring down sick or take up provisions, we were up to the 25th, although with great difficulty, finding the 500 horses per dienm, which took every one of our effective animals. My reply to the memorandum of the 25th was:- " Balaldava, Dec. 25, 1854, "Sir,-In answerto the information you cal for- "2No. L Howv many horses are employed in carrying provisions to the troops? "2.

" The Adjtaint GeaeraL" Iwrote aganonJn.3 and G;onthel7thlmadealastaprear, and two day6 after we were relieved of that destractive duty. I quite admit that, if the facts of the commissioners were well founded, their conclusions would not be unfair; but, their hcts are singlarly, and without exception, erroneous. They said it was strange that more progress was not mad% withithehutting. Now,theukeas huts arivedfromEaoland early in 5ec;ember, and when they arived my i xtractions were to get constracted a hut as a hopifor each regiment; the whole of the hutting at that time bein_ under the management of Captain King, of the Engineers. Captamu King only undertook at first to erect one or two for us, and having shown us that, we were to put the othera together as we best could. I think huts were given toms. for the hospitals on an application I made about the 23thi. of January; it was nob until late in January or the be. ginning of February that we were ordered to put up ast many huts as we could; and, therefore, if even we coulI have done it, the huts were not given to us to consitruct. before that period. As to the perioa when the men's hutsP were completed, I am not in a condition to speak; thev were finished subsequently to my quitting the Crimuea. come now to the last prgraph of the report, audI thinlc I may say that thls is the only portion of the report which. directly affects myself. Until now, I hxve been defending the cavalry more than myself The commissioners say:- " Considering, also, the suffering and severe loss of horse. from exposure to the weather in the oommnencement of the, winter, there appears to have been a want of promptitudeL or ingenuity in devisng for them some means of temporary shelter, such as saved the bagage horses of the Sappers and. .iEners at Balakiava." -from the expression "in the commencement of the, winter," this preposterous comparison must be supposed toF refer to the period between the 12th of November, whean the weather broke, to the end of the month, during which. the cavalry were detained on the two positions near SebastopoL Now, to compare the circumstances of a considerable body of men encamped upon a bleak and distant. plateau, without tools or a particle of material for construction, with the circumstances of a few baggage animals belonging to a corps consisting entirely of engineersand artlcers, and stationed at Bfala where they could avail themselves from their own stores of all necessary tools and materials, shows too clearly a spirit of detraction and inustice which is unsustainable by any sophistry or any system of reasoning whatever. Such a comparison shows thei animus of these commissioners. I am content to rest the question.of their anirnzes upon the absurdity-I may say the. maice and malgnty of that charge. It only remains for. me to show you whether I neglected any opportunity, or whether I had any available means of providing any tbelter~ whatever during the time wre occupied the heights. Thee commissoners say:- "Experience has now proved that even a very moderate degree of shelter would have been sufficient to save the lives of many of the horses, if nottomaintain them in serviceable, condition." I am unable to say what experience the commissioners have-- had on this subject, but, from my experience, I know that, to save the lives of horses during the rinter season in the; East, it is indispensable to give them so much shelter as shalk protect them from the rain and afford them dry standing ;- and it is also necessary that the shelter should be of si_cient strength to resist the violent storms of that country. I defy the commissioners to show that any amount oS promptitude or imgenuity would have availedin devising any such shelter, or any shelter at all, so long as the cavalry continned on the plateau; and the commissioners have ventured to give expression to this insinuation, or rather tobrig this private chargeagainst me, on no other foundation. than the unsupported opinion of Colonel Griffitbs. Then. the report continues:- "And it must be presumed that such measures were considered practicable, for a proposl to erect, vith the assistance of his men, some sort of cover for the horses of thecorps, appears to have been made by the officer commandngthe Scotch Grays; but the manner in which it is stated tohave been received by the lieutenant-general commandinthe cavalry was calculatedto deter other officersfrom makAng any similar proposal." Now, to justify such a presmuption, which, if welI founded, must militate against the character of an absent general officer, it was incumbent upon the commissioners to. have examined, as to the truth of this point, some other cavalry officers; but this they appear to have purposely avoided. The commissioners say, Colonel Griffiths in his. evidence states that, on the occasion referred to, Colonel Hodge, Lord William Paulet, and others were present. Now, it was but fair that, when the character of a generat officer was assailed by a subordinate officer, who must have been so clearly influenced by personal feelings in making. such astatement at all, the commiisioners ought to hava availed themselves of the oppDrtunity they had, not only of cross-examiningthiswvitness, but of examiningColonelHodge, lord Paulet, and the others referred to, on the subject. They: appear, however, to have omitted to do this;- and it is nothing less.than monstrous that the commissioners shoulda have alowed themselves to conclude thae other officers wereF deterred from a proper discharge of their duty by whativ mayhave occurred between me and Colonel Grsffiths-sithout a particle of evidence that such was the case. Colonel Griffiths expressed a desire that his examination. might be postponed for a short time, until some notes which. he had made to refresh his muemory, and which he had sentfor, should arrive. Lord Lucan pressed upon the board thati there could beno objection to proceed at once, esp~ecially as the notes werenot such as could be received in evidence. After some discussioan; General PEEL suggested that some otherv;itness should be~ called, and Colonel Griffiths' examination be postponed. Colonel Gordon was then called and examined.--He stated that, as 'well ashe could recollect, the engineer officer placed_ at Lord Lucan's disposal, for the purpose of assisting in constructing the stables, 'was named Stokes,'who'was afterwards. succeeded by Lieutenant Lennox. He could not be certain that Mr. Stokes was appointed to this dulty en the 13th of November. His impression was that Lord Lucan wantedi Mfr. Stokes to live at his LFordship's camp, but that thisofficer, instead, 'went and lived at his own cam p ,so that his. services were not quite so available as Lord Lucan wished. and expected. lord J,acan, producing a journal kept by his son, Lord. Bimghamn, said he could show by this journal, if the Courto. 'would allow him to hand it in as evidence, that Colonel Gordon 'was altogether in error, and that 31r. Stokes nevergot the order at all at that time. Lord Luacan.-Are you aware that Captain Chapman w& the farst engineer officer appointed to the- duty, and he only visited the camp the first time on the 17th of November7.- I neverheard of Captain Cbapman being appointed tothat. duty, and as he had charge, I believe, of the left attxck Iam surprised to hear that he was appointed to construct huts forthe cavalry. It is the first time I have heard such a. sugges, hion made. Lord Lucan.-You ate notaware that he visited the camp. for the first time on the 17th of November 7.-My answver is, I never heard of Captain Chapman having been employed on such duty till this moment. Lord Lucan.-Can you tel me on what day or howr ofte. Mr. Stokes attended the cavalry camp si I cannot. Tbe witness, in answoer ta further questions, said, he wcah aware that Mr. Stokes ad Lieutenant Lennos 'were appointed to do duty at the cavalry camp, but could not tell how often they visited it. Lord Lecan.-Would it, then, surprise you tbe etold that. ietenant StoLes attended on the 22d of November, and upon-that oceasiosionoly; and r. Lennox only on the day- ecamerto presentuhimself7-Nothing would surprise me. (L aug,hter.) cLordLcan.-But you do not thmink it impossble7.-It does not surprise me. Wiuness continued to state that he knew of Lord Lucan'e having been directed to make temporary stables as he best. dould, from an entry to that effect in the QuartermasterGeneral's-office in the Crimea. Now his attention wac . directed to the ciruemstance it came perfectly tao his recollectiona it occurred ohen the cavalry were on a hil towards tioe sea. Lord LSo can stld, it wa?squite clear that Colonel Gordoh. believed he had the assistance of an eagineer oflicer, whicha he thought he had shobwn to theiCourt had never been afforded him. Colonel Gordon replied that lord secan mitundeCstoone him. His elidence was, that an egineer of ficer had beenr placed at his Lordship's disposal, but he had made no statement as to whether that engineer officer had attended or not. Lord Lecanmsaid, thatfwith the best intentions on the part of the Quartermaster-General he was left te do thebest he could on this point. The examiation of Coonnel Gordon cencluded the day's Iroceed ings. The Court adjourned at 4 until 11 'clock this I L nleadayo mornif.
FIRE NEAR 3ANCHSESrnc.-At an early hour oZ Sunday morning an old cotton-mill, situated at Beswsick, near Manchester, was discovered to be on fire, thc flame; being first seen in one of the spinning-rooms on the third floor. The fire brigades from Manchester and Salford wera sent to the spot, and saved two of the three steam-engines, a reeling-room, a weaving-shed containing 400 looms, anD the warehouse; but the greater part of the mill had beea nearly destroyed before they arrived. The mill belongs to Mr. George Rloyle Chappel1, and was in the occupation of Messis. John and Joseph Plant. It was built 40 years ago. and, the fioors being well saturatedwith oil, the fire spread with much rapidity. The damage is estimated At about 10,0001., which is covered by insuaces in the West of England, Guardian, and Manchester offices. The origin of the fire is not known. Some workmen had been repairing one of the engines till a late hour on Saturday night, and they say all was right when they left.
