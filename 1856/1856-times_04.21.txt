INO M1ORE COMfMISSIONS IN THE ARMY I WITHOUT PURCHASE. The following is the letter which is now addressed to can. didates for commissions. It renders the prospect of those who expect to go in without purehase quite hopeless:- "H orse Guards, April 16. "S;r,-I am directed by the General Commanding-inChief to desire that you report yourself at the office of the Governor of the Royal 0lilitary College at Sandhurst at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 22d inst., for the purpose of undergoing a further examination in Latin or French and algebra. You are, however, distinctly to understand that, in the event of your passing satisfactorily, that circumstanco will give you no claim to be appointed to a commission before it mav come to your turn in reference to your standing with other candidates on the list; but the General Commanding-in-Chief wiU be happy to bring you forward if you can purchase, when he can do so consistently with his other engagements. "You are required to produce to the CoUege authorities a certificate of confirmation, and his Lordship deems it highly expedient that you should also take with you the ' memorandum' or paper of instruction which wvas issued to guide you in your studies, in order that if any question should arise as to the course in which you are to be examined, the professors may, upon reference to the paper, be able at once to decide the point. " I have to request that you will acknowledge the receipt of this letter wvith as littUe deL.y as possible. "I have the honour to be, Sir, "Yoiur most obedient humble servant, " C. YORKE. " PS.-I beg to observe that in the event of your passing the examination at Sandhurst no hope can be given you of an appointment to a commission unless you are prepared to purchase, upwvards of 250 gentlemen, who have passed, still remaining unprovided for. Commissions w-ithout purchase do not suffice to provide for officers of Ihlilitia who bring men for the Line, and must first be provided for, and considerable reductions of o9icers in a great number of regiments may be expected.
THE PEACE REJoIciNGs.-In the House of Common s on Friday ni6ht the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the large temporary erections which have during the past week arisen in the Green Park and Hyde Park were intended to be used in connexion with the public rejoicings for the conclusion of peace. This was the first official announcement of any intention on the part o' the Government to followv tho course adopted at the conclusion of peace in 1814. It is rarely that the Governnient of this country takes the initiative in any matters of public rejoicing; and the public will naturally feel considerable interest to learn the details of the plan which, in the present instance, is about to be adopted. The grand peacefJtes will consist almost exclusively of a dispiay of pyrotechnic art, of the most magnificent and unprecedented character. All the available resources of Woolwich arsenal have been for some time past directed to the making up of enormous quantities of every description of fireworks. The public offices will be illuminated, and no doubt the examnple set by the Government will be very generally followed by the inhabitants of the metropolis. There will not be, on the present occasion, any mimic fleet, constructed at enormous expense, for the purpose of manceuvring on the Serpentine water, as was the case in 1815; nor will there, so far as we can learn, be any~ ornamental bridges, or Temples of Peace, nor any dreary illumination of the trees in the mall of St. James's Park, such as were gazed upon at the conclusion of the last war. There will, however, be, as it is stated, a grand re,iew by the Queen in person, of a large military force in Hyde Park. The displays of fireworks will take place in Hyde Park, the Green Park, on the summit of Primrosebill, and in the Victoria Park, at the east end of the metropolis. A general holyday will also be announced, probably in the course of the next week. In the Green Park, as well as in Hyde Park, a large number of workmen have been busily engaged durino the past week in constructing a large temporary wooden shed of e,normous dimensions, which is to serve as the place of deposit for the fireworks, and also for their preparation and mounting previous to their discharge. a hese erections are totaly devoid of anything like an architectural character, nor are they intended to produce any effect in the celebration of the fete. The building in the Green Park is 200 feet in length, 25 feet in height tothe eaves, and 30 feet wide. The front of the building faces the St. James's Park, and is at present perfectly open, with the exception of the framework necessary to carry the roof. It will be covered in with tarpaulin while the workmen are making the necessary preparations. The back of the building towards Piccadilly is boarded up, but a row of 1S windowvs, 12 feet in iength, and containing seven lengths of glass, affords light to the interior when the front is closed up. At about 100 feet in advance of the building a screen, extending the whole length of the building, and 10 feet in height, is erected, which will prevent the movements of the workmen being seen by the crowds Of spectators. Beyond this screen again, and distant from it 200 gards, strong wooden rails have been put up. wh2ich e.xtend in an elliptical form from the rails in Piccadilly at the east side of the park to its extreme western end, close by the Welling2ton statue. Within this vast enclosure no person will bie admitted, except those<acUaly employed. T^he whole of the railings on the north side of the p ark, extending along Piccadilly, have been closely boarded up, and the pavement will be occupied by a strong body of police, who will prevent persons crowding in that direction. Police will also be stationed aroutnd the outer rails. The site occupied by this building is close to the old reservoir, and, being upon the top of the rising ground, the spectators will be afforded an admirable view of the extra. ordinary and magnificent display of f'irework;s. In Eyrde Park the same active p reparations are going on. The bumlding erected there is of' the samne dimensions as the one in the Green Park, and its front faces Grosvenor-gate. It is 400 yards from the Marble Arch on the north-west side of the park. In front of the shed there is a screen as in the other park, ten feet in height, and an imnmense area of three hundred yards' square will be railed off, and which will be kept clear of spectators. The whole of the iron hurdles on the side of the thoroughfares throughout the park are in course of removal, so as to afford greater facilities for the movements Of the operators, and to prevent the prob.ability of any acei~ dentsarsing from pressure against them. The display of pyrotechny in Hyde Park may be seen readily from the Edgware-road, and also thence embracing the whole of the interior as far round as the Albert-gate on the 1Enighte. bridge side. The building in Hyde Park is of the greateststrength, and the roof is covered with paited calico for protection against the weather. A buillding of the same size and description will be conimenced to-morrow in the VTictoria Park, and is to be completed within aweek. On the top of Primrose-hill a similar structure is to be immediately commenced, and stages to be provided for the discharge of an enormous number of rockets. By this arrangement the inhabitants of each part of the metropolis will be afforded an opportunity of witnessing in their own neighbourhood those extraordinary displays of pyrotechny, and will not be under the necessity of undergoing the fatigue of waLking from one end of London to the other. It w as intended to have had a fifth display at Battersea Park, but that idea has, we understand, been abandoned. The cosstract for erecting all the necessary buildings has been given to Messrs. Lucas Brothers, of the Belvedere-road, and the amount of energy which they have displayed in pushing forward the work;s may be judged by the fact that they only commenced their operations last Monday. The direction of the work-s, under Mess. L.ucas Brothers, is intrusted to Messrs. Pooley and Swranson, foremen of the establishment. -ObscirTei' SEWVAGE OF GREAT CITIF.S.-A scheme is now-. under the consideration of Government, onthe suggestion of* a gentleman of Bristol, for the deodorization and conversion of the sewage of large cities. It is proposed that Government should contract with the municipal aathorities for the manufacture of this mnaterial into patent manure; that it. should be done by convict Labour, in large workms at a sufficient distance from the towns to pirevent annoyance; and that the sewage should be deodorized in the pipes before reaching the receptacle, It is asserted that the scheme would be profitable not only in a sanitary but in a financial point of viewr to large cities.

qHE HOTEL P.LUDERERS. iI1o two AMericans 3 4DTE;, ARL 19. L atw mrloals chargedI with plunderllg hotels, who were apprehended for robberies at the Albion and Royal hotels at Manchester, were on Saturday re-examined before the Manchester magistrates, and there is now but little doubt that they are part of a gang of most accomplished cracksmen, who have been traveling through Europe for some time past, practising their calling with no ordinary success. The nameof the first prisoner apprehended2is Oscar Kingston, calling hiimself a merchant, from Philadelphia, who was charged with stealing 251. from Mr. Edden, a commercial traveller, sleeping at the Royal hotel, Manchester, on Tuesday night. The other gives his name Daniel E. Branch, and he calls himself a lawver, from New York; he was taken at the Adelphi hotel, LiverIool, on Thursday, charged with having entered the bedrooms of four travellers and robbed them at the Albion Hotel, Manchester, on -Tuesday, night, in addition toshavinD stolen a large quantity of foreiga coins from the landlord's bedroom. These prisoners statcd on their apprehension that they were intending to return to America by the P`ersia steamer on Saturday, and while they were under exarnination on Saturday morning an electric telegraph message was received at Manchester, that an accomplice, named Allen Howard, had been that morning apprehended, on board the Persia, as it was leaving the port, for robbing a gentleman of 600L at anhotelin London. Of this money Oscar Kingston had paid 1001. a Bank of Englana note tDo Messrs. EBaary and Co., of Regent-street, his tailors, getting the change, andhence an advertisement in 7The l7imes of Wednesday from thisfirm, requesting to know "Mr. Oscar Kingston's present addre." The publication on Friday of the circumstances under which the prisoners had been apprehended at Manchester brought a letter to Manchester also on Saturday from the Hotel de la Rue, Paris, stating that Branch had committed some heavy robberies there. It is stated that Branch had sent off to New York, before he left France, a trunk by a steam vessel sailing from Havre, addressed to himself;, to be left at the offices of the company till called for; and, as this is supposed to contain a good deal of the plunder acquired by the confederates, a messenger is about to be sent off for the purpose of taking a peep into it. When Oscar Kingston was taken at the Poyal Hotel, Manchester, he had managed to divest himself of everything which could lead to a suspicion of his calling, but subsequently two inatruments were found concealed behind mats or oilelotbs, between his bedroom and that which had been robbed, which throw a liglit on the facility with which gentlemen's bedrooms could be entered and plundered without much disturbance. One of these is an instrument entirely of steel, in the form of a morticing chisel, well adapted to cut out a panel, unscrew the hinges of a box, or prise open a door. The other is in the form of a pair of phers, the two ends of whicb, when pressed together, forn a barrel, well adapted to lay hold of the end of ake oas to turn it in the look, so that, supposing a door to locked inside, and the key left in the lock, the person having these pliers in his possession would be able to turn the key from the outside, and on leaving the room could relock the door without the necessity of removing the key. Among the luggage of Branch was found a formidable instrument used by thieves in New York, and termed a knucklde-duster." It is a thick flat piece of metal, about three-quarters of a pound in weight, with holes at one of the edges through which the four fingers of the hand can be pass. aWher put on for use and the fingers clinched over it, the larger portion of the metal fills the fist, while the outer edge presents four rings of solid metal over the knuckles of the second joints of the fingers, calculated to give powerful effect to a blow struck by the wearer. Up to Saturday information bad been received of 12 or 14 hotel robberies, which the prisoners are supposed to have perpetrated, several of the most serious being in London and aris. The prisoner, Daniel E. Branch, was first placed at the bar of the polce court, to be re-examined on the charge of five robberies during Tuesday night at the Albion Hotel, Mlanchester; hut ultimatey only one ease w as taken against him. Inspector Maybery and Police-constable Shanley described the apprehension of the prisoner at the Adelphii Hotel, Liverpool, and the search of his luggage. They produced four shitmarked " M. de B." a small portemonnaie with mother of pearl sides, inlaid with silver, and a silk mantle. Mr. Michael de Burgue said, he had been lodging at the Albion Hotel, Manchester, and went to London on Thursday week, intendig to return next day, and had consequently left his luggage behind. He did not return until after the robbery, when he missed all the articles produced. He could not swear to the mantle or purse, because he had no private marks on them; but the shirts were his property, and had been taken from the Albion Hotel. They were bought from a celebrated shirtmaker in Paris, wiso put his initials " M de B." on them. Other evidence was tendered, showing that the prisoner slept at the Albion on Tuesday night, and left very early next morning, with the other facts of a suspicious character detailed at the examination on Thursday. Mr. Ovens, barrister, defended the prisoner, and, setting aside the claim of Mr. de Burgue to the mantle and purse as one not proved, he directed attention to the marks on the shirts. He said Branch openly stated, when he was first brought up, that he had been travelling for months in this country and on the continent; and what was thern in the evidence to negative the supposition that he bought shirts in Paris as well as Mr. de Bergue, and even from the same maker? This admitted, tnere was really no evidence against him, inasmuch as the initials wvere the same for both names. Mr. Maude (chairman of the miagistrates) said, the one name was Michael de Burgue, and the other Daniel E. Blanch. Mr. Ovens said, that was so- but supposing Branch, when asked what name he wouid have marked upon the shirts, to say his name was " Mr. D. E3. Branch," a Parisian would be very likely tounderstand him 3fonsieur de Branch, and accord5irgy mark the initials " ALt de B.," which was exactly the mark on these shirts, with a space between the D and Es. The magistrates, without taling much time for consideration, decided to commit the prisoner for trial. Oscar Kingston was then placed at the bar, charged -with entering a bedroom at the Royal Hotel, Manchester, on the same nught. Mfr. StanisLad, solicitor, of Boston, Lincolnshire (who it is said has been robbed of a large sum recently at an hotel in London) conducted the case. MIr. Edden, of London, said, he slept at the Royal Hotel on Tuesday night. ALbout haLf-past 2 o'clock on W8ednesday morning he was aw oke by a person having entered his bedroom, and who he saw examining his clothes at the foot of the bed. It was a man in drawers and Jersey vest. He asked him what he did there? when the man bounded out of the room and witness after him, but the man escaped; and he could not say which way he took along the corridor. Notes to the value of 251. had been taken from one of his pockets, which were afterwards found on the floor outside his door. Had locked his bedroom door on going to bed, and left the key in the door. The evidence given on Wednesday of the prisoner being seen on the landing over Mr. Edden's room after the robbery, with other suspicious circumstances, and the finding of the chisel and pliers spoken of above, was again repeated. Mr. R. S. Sowler, barrister, addressed the bench upon t e case in favour of the prisoner, observing that the prosecutor could not identify Kingston as the man in his bedroom when he awoke, and all the other circumstances were matters of mere suspicion. The Bench said, they would commit the prisoner for Mr. Stanisland here said, that he had himself been robbed while at an hotel in London of a large sum of moneY (600G.), and he had reason to believe the prisoner was an accomplice in the robbery. Another man, connected with the prisoner, had just been captured on board the Persia, at Liverpool, when about to sail for New York, and would be taken to London for examination, several waiters from Morleps Hotel, London, who had been down at Liverpool to identify the prisoner, having to return to London, where it would be more convenient for that reason to hear the case. He wished the prisoner Kingston, therefore, to be remanded, and that the magistrates would give him up to be taken to London. Mr. Maude said, he would remand the prisoner, but the best way to proceed would be to apply for a lcabeas compus. The magistrates declined to consider any application for bail atpresent. LIVERPOOL~ ARIL 19. On Friday night a telegraphic message was received in Liverpool from London, stating that a man, suspected of being connected with the gang of swellmobsmen who effected the large robberies at several London hotels a few days ago, bad changed a number of the missing notes in the 3netropolis, and had, it was believed, gone to ^iverl. On Saturday morning, at an early hour, Scott, one of the local detective officers, having been made familiar with the description of the man wanted, went on board the Royal -Mail steam. ship Persia, which was preparing to leave the port for New York, withthe mails and an unusually large number of passengers. After making some inquiries he went up to one of the first cabin passengers, a snart-looking Yank-ee, with a moustache and beard, *who wore elegantly cut clothes and coloured boots. and sported a quantity of heavy jewelry and a fancy stickl, with a gold horse's leg for the handle. He charged him with being concerned with two men, apprehended in Manchester, in the London hotel robberies, and took him into custody.

TEn TBIRKs AT Ho-&e.-A letter from Constantinople gives the following additional particulars about the murder of the young Greek girl at Toultcha :-" The -Pasha, who is a general of brigade, first saw the girl stand. ing at the door of a house in Toultcha, and her youth (she was only 18) and her great beauty caused him to be suddenly smitten with her. lIe immediately had her seized by his soldiers, placed in a carriage, and carried to an adjacent viflaoge. *When the parents of the girl commenced their searchafter her the rasha carried her to a more distant village, and took up his quartersima house occupied by a Greek family. Helockedthegirl up in a chamber, and -placed a watch over her, but she found means to speak with the mnistress of the house and to implore her to save her. The woman went at once to the tc?~or-badgis, or Christianchie's of the commune, and they taking their horses proceeded to Varna, where they laid a complaint before the Pasha-Governor, the FrenchGeneral commanding the town, the English Consul, and the Greek Bishop. Orders were sent to the Pakshto present himself at Varna, and he set out; and it was before leaving that he gave orders to a corporal to murder the girl, which order-he executed as already stated."

STATE OF TBADE. MANCHESTER, APRIL 19. The activity of the cotton-market throughout the week has disposed buyers to operate more freely here in cotton goods, but the upvvard tendency of prices, caused by the 1higher rates of cotton (amounting to ld. per lb. on fair Orleans, and id. on Upland and lfobile). has been a checkto some extent. MIanufacturers asked 1'd. to 3d. per piece advance on cloths on Tuesday, and spiiners iL to md. per lb., and being well engaged upon preious orders they have maintained their position w'ith great fnnesa. The result, however, has been & fair business. IR M 40 inch shirtings the advance has been iire freely responded to than ia other goods, but even in the lower qualities of domestics, which have been of late a good deal neglected, there has been some improevement. Long cloths are also more saleable, and have partaken of the advance. T cloths are light in stock, and axe rather dearer. Pring cloths are in fair demand, with light stocks, and a slight advance in price. On the whole there has not been a large business, but manufacturers are generally able to cominand an advance, beainga . fair- proportion to the. ncreased coit of the raw material. In yarns, there has been a considerable business in cops and warps for manufacturers at the advance above-named For export buyers have shown great unwillingness to give the full advance demanded, but sellers have been able to do business at a decided improvement on last week'sterms, even where the full advance of id. per lb. was a check Some forged checks were paid into the hands of merchants here in the early part of the week by a manufacturer at Burnley, who immediately absconded, and it was at. one time rumoured that these forgeries were to a large amount. We have only heard of two however, one for 3601. and the otls,r for 4801., and all doubt as to the reality of the forgeries has now been set at rest by a police notice offeringa reward for the apprehension of the forger. Since his flight the forger has been made a bankrupt. BIRMINGHAM APRiL 19. The resolutions adopted attthe late quarterly meetings in Staffordshire and East Worcestershire have imparted, as might be expected, considerable steadiness to the iron trade of those districts. Subsequent events have justified the expectations of the leading members of the trade; and prices last fixed are well maintained. The requirements for the home marlket continue to be good; and even those, in anticipation of peace, are already upon the increase. "An Ironmaster," well-informed upon this subject, writes,"Iron for shipbuilding,-viz, plates, angle and rivet ironis in very goo demand,and some of the continental merchants have been ordering largely during the week. A large buyer from Holland has been through the district, and has bought considerable quantities of chains, eables, anchors, &ac. There is, however, a great slackness in the orders for boiler and boat plates, and this has prevailed during the last nine or twelve months. The restrictions upon exports to the northern ports of Europe during the war have, as a matter of course, considerably interfered withl these branches of the iron trade; but now peace is established, and the ports of theBaltic and the BlackSea are thrown open, a great accession of trade is expected by the iron manufacturers of the Staffordshire districts. There is at the present time an .unusually large demand for rails; and, as a matter of course, the large orders now in the possession of Welsh lhouses necessarily affect, to a great extent, and most favourably, the Staffordshire first-class makers. It is known that such is the present demand for best brands that several establishments in the immediate neighbourhood of Tipton, Oldbury, and Dudley are only limited by their capacity of production. In addition to the contracts now on hand furtherspecifications for tenders have, within these few weeks, been issued by several of the principal railway companies, and it is believed, from the state of other lines, requirin renewal, others must speedily follow.' The Great Forthern Company requires immediatelv a large supply of iron bolts, nuts, cast iron brackets, and 2,450tons ofrails; while a large order is also in the' market for the supply of rails required for the continuation of the Ambergate line between Colwich and Notting- The iron-foundry business of the district is improving. At Westbromwvich the hollow ware manufacturers, as compared with what they were 12 months ago, are active. The. tin ware of manufacture, notwithstanding the high price of plates, is good, and most of the establishments are well off for orders. There is little new to be reported with respect to the state, of the general manufactures of Birmingham. The brass' foundry, but more especially the copper tube business, is described as brisk. The large orders which have recently been executed for shipbuilding in Liverpool have been succeeded by others which, although less extensive, give fair employment to our numerous manufacturers. The factors of the town and neighbourhood speak favourably of the home demand for Birmingham manufactures; or, at any rate, they do not complain, and that may be deemed as some evidence of hopeful prospects, if not of the present satisfactory state of our varied manufactures. Daring the week several foreign orders have been given out, and the expectations recently expressed of the American market have been more than realized. The orders from Germany are already good, and even for the Baltic commissions from merchants formerly Largely engaged in that trade have been received. The only drawback upon what otherwise would be a prosperous state of commerce and manufactures is the continued high rate of discount. The reports received from Coventry, Redditch, and MVidderminster continue to be satisfactory. In each of these manufacturing towns there are symptoms of renewed activity. In Bromsgrove the wrought nail busness is flat, and s, as it has been for many years past, gradually giving way, to the cut nail manufacture. Fortunately, now the staple business of this neighbourhood is indifferent the spring season affords considerable out-door employmenit, to which large numbers of the nailers have already had recourse. LEEDS, APIRIL 19. The woollen cloth trade has been steady the wvhole of this week, about an average amount of business having been done in the cloth-halls and the warehouses. To-day the mnXrkets have shown ronsiderable animation, and a large amount of cloth has been sold, including more of the higher priced kinds than 'on any late market day. The lower priced ani light goods for summer wear-mixtures, tweeds, and fancy cloakings-have met with tolerably ready purchase at some improvement in price. A good deal of wool-dyed blacks and some heavy and medium qualities of white have been sold, and altogether the markets to-day have been of a satisfactory character. The manufacturers throughout the district are well-employed, many of them being engaged on orders given out in anticipation of an augmented demand for both the home and foreign markets on the declaration of peace. No ver3 sanguine hopes were indulged as to an extensively increased demand for woollen fabrics on the resumption of commercial relations wvith Rusaia, and it appears as if the moderate expectations entertained wilU be realized. If so, there is ground for believing that the woollen manufacture of this district has a good prospect of prosperity before it, and the muore so as the export trade to America and Australia is improving. It is anticipated that the value of the woollens exported during the present monthwill greatly exceed those exported in the corresponding month of 155. Wools are firm in price, and the demand is regular and g,uite equal to the stocks on hand, which are rather below tnan above the average at this season of the year. There is expected to be a very good supply of colonial wools at the forthcoming sales in London, which are to commence oD. Thursday, tne Sth day of May. Probably 50,000 bales or maore will be put up, and whether the prices will advance or not it is har to foretelL If there be a great demand for foreign manufacturers it is likely there will be a rise in the sales. The demand at present is good for wools for both the woollen and tIme worsted branches. There is a good prospect of the iforthcoming English and Scotch clip, sheep being generally reported as in excellent fleece. The price of flax having alreadyfallen, and there being a prospect of soon having a supply from lussia, has given a stimulus to the flax-spining trade in this town, and the sa inners and manufacturers are graduLally increasing their The worsted trade at Bradford is more active, there bein~ an improvement in the demand for both yarns and most decriptions of piece goods, but the manufactureres complain that fully remunerative prices are hard to obtain. The report of the Ealffax market to-day is as follows - For wool, prices have a firm appearance, and for wor-ted and yarns the prices are higher and more business is NOTTINGHAM, APRIL 19. A goodly number of shippers are in the hosiery market, whose purchases are so considerable that stocks, already low, are daily becoming smaller. For the home supply, however, but a comparatively limited business is doing buyers contendmg with great pertinacity against thme ad vanced rates. But this is useless in the exsting state of the: market. Spun silk is again 3d. a pound dearer.

A good attendance of millers at our Com-Exchange on Friday. Most of them were inquirers rather than buyers, wanting to know how the future course of the trade may be. Wheat, flour, and other articles of the corn trade, excepting Indian eorn, were somewhat easier in price, and a moderate business for consumption. Firmness on the part of holders of Indian com enabled them to obtain an advance of 6d. per quarter over the low prices of Tuesday. Actual sales of wheat and four ace of very limited extent and, although there are several inquirers for the finer qualities, a glance at the " Gazette" average price of wheat for lat week operates s a caution against Large transactions. NOTTINGHAM, Araa 1iQ We have had a delightful growing weeks plenteous showers, and warm day, and so little frost at night as to do no particular harm.

DONCASTER, Artist 19. We bave had during the greater part of this week a recurrence of the cold east winds which have been so prevalent this monuth and last Vegetation, though not actually checked, has made but very indifferent progress since last Saturday, and all our farmers are now vishing for warmer weather, there being ample moisture in the ground both for grain and grass. and every symptom of abundance, provided only we havegenial weather.

In low situations some of the plant Ihas turned rather red; but it is believed with a little smn tie blade wil fully recover its healthy appearance. On several of the thin soils a good part of the crop has not come Pi, owing to over-cropping and other causes Barley is coming up in the most premuising manner-very even, and of a rich colour. There is howrever, no longer room to doubt that the quantity of land under this grain at the present time is much IeS than the average, and certainly less than it ought to be for the consumptive requirements of the oountry. We have heard opinions on this subject from farmers whose knowledge extends over many thousands of acres, and they sal gree in stating that the proportion of barley Down is far below what they have ever known it. The growers have been tempted by the high price of wheat to appropriate as much land as tbey could to that leading crop; but now that the war has ceased, and ther3 is every probability of increased commercial prosperity, the .demand for malt wlt be lagely incra With good harvest otgrain it is likely enough barleywill be proportionatelya more valuable - crop than wheat this year. - Peas are coming up strong and well- Beans are strong andhealthy, and with warmweather wouldshootuprapidly.

]A-AIL WAY INTELLIGENCE. ABERDFlE1=. The half-yearly meeting ot this company was held on Saturday at Xadley's Hotel, Mr. A. Pirie in the chair. hlr. Ieith, the secretary, read the notice convening the meeting and the iminutes of the last meeting, which were confirmed. The report, an abstract of which appeared in Thle Times of Monday, was taken as read. The CnLuiiAa, in moving the adoption of the report, explained that at the last nieeting it wAs aTgreed that the Aberdeeni and the Scottish Midland Railway Companies should jointly lease the Dundee and Arbroath Railway on certain terms, and a bill was promoted in Parliament to sAnction the arrangement. The directors also introduced a bill into Parliament for authorizing the amalgamation of the Aberdeen and Scottish Midland Railway Companies, and, after considerable opposition, which lasted three or four days, he was glad to say that the committee on the blll unanimously decided that the preamble wasproved. (Hear, hear.) Hecouldassuretheproprietors that the directors considered the measure of great unportance to the two companies. On the passing of the act the shares of both companies would retain their present position, the two lines woult be worked by one staff, the afiairs would be managed by one board of directors, and the traffic would be developed so as to promote the interests of the united company. The directors of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway had carried out the arrangement to a certain extent for leasing the line, but vere prevented by a large minority of the shareholders who repudiated theagreement, andeonsequently the arrangement failed, and the bill for leasing the line was ithdrawn. Some of the shareholders, iWho were opposed to the measure, thought that a larger rent should be naid for the line, but he, on the contrary, thought they hd offered them sufficiently high terms, and what appeared to the directors of the Aberdeen and Midland Companies to be the full value of the Arbroath line. It was thought by the opponents of the measure that they would force them to ofser higher terms; in that, however, they were mistaken, and he believed the dissentients had tak-en a course which would be found prejudicial to the interests of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway Company. With regard to the report he had to submit for their approval, he congratulated them on the great increase in the receipts, vhioh had kept up far b'eyond the anticipations of the directors. The increase had been steady and progressive. The receipts for the past half-year amounted to 61,0001. for the corresponding period of the preceding year they amointed to 53,000!., shoeing an increase of 8,0001. The receipts for the corresponding period of 1854 amounted to 46,G000!., showing an increase of 7,000!. The directors regretted that the increase in the traffic during the past half-year was swvallowved up in the increased o.xpoeases, the details of wvhich vere given in the report. The directors of both companies (the Aberdeen and Scottish Midland) had endeavoured to work the traffic as economically as possible. It would be recollected that in 1851 an agreement was entered into with the Scottish Central Railway Company for working the traffic of the Aberdeen and ScottishMidland Companies, and, in accordance with that agreement, the plant was handed over to the Scottish Central Company. Just before the last half-yearly meeting the latter company gave them notice that they would cease to work the line, and thus an end was pult to the agreement. The directors of the Aberdeen Companyhad then to work the line with insufficient plant, they were placed in considerable difficulty, and had to hire engines from other companies to enable them to carry on the traffic. The Aberdeen Company's engines wvere handed over by the Scottish Central Company in a much worse condition than they had a right to expect. The repairs and renewals during the half-year amounted to 4,0061., whereas for the corresponding period the expense did not exceed1,600!. The returns showed that if the Aberdeen engines were not kept in good repair theScottish Central engines certainlyhad been. The joinit traffic of the Aberdeen and Scottish Midland Railways was divided in certain proportions-the former had 7-lOths, and the latter 3-lOths of the whole, and the expenses were allotted in the same proportion. In working che traffic of both lines jointlytheyhad not deemed it exedient to consolidate the working staff, which they would do in the event of the amalgamation bill receiving the Royal ascent. He thouehttheymiglt then look forward to decreasing the expenses of working; there would also be a saving of interest in borrowing snoney at lower rates, and they would endeavour to put both lines in goodworeing order. The expenses had also been increased in consequence of the want of workshops to repair the plant, but means were now being adopted to supply that deficiency. For the maintenance of way they would in future have more to pay than they had paid, and their plant would require additions every year. He thought that one or tNvo new engines should be added annually, wvith a view to keep up the stock. He concluded by moving the adoption of the report. Mr. STI;LIsXG had great pleasure in seconding the adoption of the report. They had taken stepsto enable them to repair their plant as cheaply as other companies. The item of coke had increased their working expenses, for, instead of obtaining it on the same terms as the Scottish Central Company, at 21s. per ton, it had cost them 25s. per ton, and they had p.aid 3001. during the half-year for the use of other companies' engines; but when they got coke ovens and workshops, there would be a reduction in the expenses. So long as the traflic in goods and live stock had to econducted at very low fares their percentage of work. ing would always be large; and so long as their goods traffic was increasing, and the passenger traffic did not increase, they must expect theircost of working to be high. ie believed the amalgamation act would enable them to raise money on more moderate terms. Resolutions were then passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum on the l per cent. preference shares, and authorizing the directors to issue deferred dividend wvarrants to the holders of 7 per cent. preference stcok for the half-year's interest due on the Ist of May next. In reply to a question, it was stated that the increased cost of repairing the engines was about 2,0001. ; but that, on the whole, they had no great reason to complain of the Scottish Central Company; the engines were handed over from that company in the state approved by the arbitrator. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors.
PROVmIETLA EsCAI2E.-A case of providential escapo from being instantly kdlled, as well as remarkable presence of mind, occurred at the Wellington colliery, Whitehaven, on Saturday, the 12th inst. a man named Joseph Reid, who for several years has discharged the duties of banksman, was in the act of removing a full basket of coals from the cage and replacing an empty one, when a portion of the basket caught his clothes and he was flung head foremost into the shaft. With great presence of mind he seized hlold of the stationary rope, against which he was fortunately throwvn, and this, to some extent, checked his momentum. He grasped the rope firmly in his arms, but continued to sEde do,ru a distance of about 20 fathoms before he was able completely to arrest his descent, and the friction of the rope not only wore away his clothes, but even the skin and a portion of the flesh from the inside of his arms. Still he held on, life being the stake for which he was contending. When he succeeded in bringing himself to a standstill ho managed to twist his legs round the rope, which in some measure relieved his arms. Here, then, we have the unfortunate man suspended, head downwards, about 20 fathoms from the mouth of a shaft at least 100 fathoms in depth, his only hope of safety being to cling to the rope, with arms lacerated by the friction of sliding down that distance from the surface. He was unable to reverse his position on the rope. Of course the most prompt measures were taken to release him from his predicament, but at that time little hope was entertained of saving his life. On the engine being set in motion a new danger awaited lim, which was that of being brou'ht in contact with the descendina basket. This, howroverv he happily escaped, and he was at length safelybroughttothe surface, with his feet uppermost, and released from his uncomfortable predicamnent.

Indian descriptions were well supported, purchases continuing to be made for investment. Less activity 'was apparent in French and Belgian shares, the late advance having brought in sellers. No great change occurred in Australian land and banking shares, but quotations on the average were fairIy maintained. Mining securities exhibited steadines with a moderate amount of business.

ThE IETROPOLITAhN CEmETERiES i THE EAST.- Copies of reports made to th EHome-office by Dr. Suther land and Mr. Holland on the state of certain metropolitan cemeteries have been published on the motion of Mr. W. A. Wilkinson, M.P. TIhese reports disclose the prevalence of practices more or less open to objection, at the Cambridge-heath and North-East London Cementery, near Victoria Park, the barialground of St. James-the-Less Bethnal-green, the Victoria Park Cemetery, Bethnal-green, and theA^bney Park Cemetery at Stoke Newington. The practices pursued at the Victoria E'ark Cemetery are really revolting. r.Hollnd visited this loathsome place one Sunday afternoon and "wvitnessed scenes of a very painful nature." He saw 30 or 40 coffins thrust into graves, and all were left uncovered while he stayed; the graves were very near each other, and the bustle was continmous and distressing. One quarter of the cemetery appears to be a mass of putrefying corruption, consisting of several thousand carcases, contained in coffins immediately con. tiguons in the same graves, and separated from those in the ajoining graves by a few inches of soil only, which are heaped up on each. other partly below, partly above the natural level of the ground, and covered only by a few feet of open gravel. The quantity of putrid gas given off by such a mass of corruption must be far greater than the soil can absorb or decompose. Unfortunatelythe Victoria Park Cemetery is exempted by act of Parliament from any order in Council to close it up. The proprietor, Mr. C. S. Blutler, M.P. for the Tower Hamlets, has taken steps to remedy some of the evils pointed out by the in. spectors, but the cemetery should, no doubt, be closely watehed, as r. Holland recommends. The result of a snb sequent vsit (on the 3d of larch) is as yet undecided. The Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company was wont to allow the practice of " pit-burial," but the directors have since made regulations which, though not "perfectly satisfactory," are a great improvement on t e former practices. It is a disgraceful fact, according to lDr. Sutherland, that at the present time the only cemetery company which combines in its practice a proper regard for public health and public decency is the London Necropolis Company at Woking. " The nianner of conducting interments in this cemeter I (the doctoraffirms) " is as commendable as the practice of tie other companies is the contrary."

IRELAND. (FBOX oUR. OWN oOlrSPON'DPNT) DUBIJIN, SATURDAY AOPUNMG. THE TIPPERARY -ANK. The official manager having lodged his list of contributories, the next step in order will be a call upon the Master in Chaucery to decide upon the validity of that ist, who are entitled to be removed from it, and who are thqe whom the law will not permit to escape their fiill share of the responsibility of the Tipperay Bank giant swindle. The Freeman of this moming, commernting upon this subject, calls attention to a discrepancy in the official list and the return made by the directors of the bank, in pursuance of the provisions of the 8th and 9th Victoria, chap. 37, and published in the Dublin GazeMte on the 8th of February. This discrepancy is so remakable that it will be necessay to draw at some lenglh from the statement of the Dublin journal:- "Fronathereturnmadeand publishedin February the names of two of the directors of the bank are altogether omitted-Mr. Wilson Kennedy, of Clomnel, and 3Mr. Vincent Scully, XP., Dublin. This-ominous, strange, and inexplicable as it seems-is rendered still more remarkable from the fact that one of the omitted directors-Mr. Wilson Kennedy-is represented by the official manager as being a holder of 100 shares at the period of the suspension, and that the other-Mr. Vimcent Scully, Es represented as a holder of no less than 700 shares at the sarne period. It is just possible that M1r. Kennedy and r. Scully bought in at some period between the 2d of February, the date of the return, and the 16th of February, the date of the suspension of the bank. Such strange coincidences have occasionally occurred that it is difficultto assertthat these two gentlemen, who are niow returned by the official manager, after an examination of the private books and documents of the banl-, as being directors at the time of the suspension-viz., on the 1lth of February--did not become directors between the 2d and the 16th, and did not during the same short interval purchase up the S0O shares which the present return shows them to have held on the fatal 16th. It is incumbent on these gentlemen to show the date on which they purcbased these shares, and the date on which they becaue directors of this now colebrated concern. IUp to this the public gave James Sadleir all the credit of the famous report which represented a bankrupt concern with 400,0001. debts and30,000Z. of assets as paying6 per cent. dividend, adding some thousands, irrespective of the most oddly accurate shillings, pence, and farthings on the credit side of the current account, to the rest fund, and adding, over and above all, a bonus of 31. per share or per cent. to the stock. Every published statement made on behalf of the bankrepresented Mr. James Sadleir ai the sole diractor-the factotum of the concern. All the odium, all the guilt, all the shame, was generously, were it not that it was falsely, assumed by John Sadleir at the instant of his fatal end. James Sadleir's report of the condition of the bank shows that he was not as blameless as his dying brother represented him; fqr he either signed an incorrect document knowing it to Be so, or he signed it not knowing whether it was true or false. If it should turn out that Mr. Scully and Sir. Klennedy were shareholders before the 3d of February the other shareholders and the depositors will doubtless inquire how it came to pass that their names were not returned in the list, as required by act of Parliament; and if it should appear that they became directorsaubsequent to thatreturn, and on the very eve ofthe suspension these gentlemenwillhxvegrave cause of complaint against their political confrere and blood relation for seducing them at sach a time into such a concern by the fallacious report which bore his signature, and represented the swindle bank as the most prosperous concern in the kingdom. While, however, the newly ascertained directors have great cause to complain, assuniing that Mr. Scudly and Mr.i Kennedy were not shareholders on the 2d, and that the return whvich represents them as not being in any way connected vith the bank on that dav is not as false as was the report of profits, bonusses, and dividends, the depositors and other contributories, who have been the innocent victims of their confidence in the Sadleir bank, have every reason to rejoice at the improved prospects which the official manager's list of contribatories holds out. Mr. Wilson Kennedy and Mr. Scully are men of considerable property, and their being added to the list of contributories will lighten the burden considerably on the other solvent shareholders. There are, besides Messrs. Wilson Kennedy and m. Scully, other new names of contributories added in the present list, who come under the category of contributories who sold ;within thrce years whose wvealth and personal reputation ill add considerably to the prospect of a dividend. It would be invidions to select the names, hut every mrn conversant wvth the mercantile affairs of Dublin will have recognised several names among those who sald out within the three years whose seatus wvillconfer considerably increased alue on the deposit notes of the bank." MAYuOOTH. The ultimate effect of Mr. Spooner's triumph on Tuesday last, so far as Irish constituencies are concerned, is thus correctly foreshadoweed by an organ of moderate Conservatism:- " As far as this country is concerned (says the Lcinst.'r BEqpre=), we car hardly imagine anything more unlucky or ill.timedforLordDerbythanthe successof Mr. Spooner's motion on Tnesday night last. There is no doubt that his Lordship was fast gaining ground in Ireland. Three borough constituencies within a very short time substituted his political friends forhis political antagonists, and, in the event of a "eneral election, there were strong reasons to believe teat a similar course would have been pursued in a vast number of instances. The nefarious doings of the late Mr. Sadleir in the estunation of the peoole had thrown a sort of stigmna on all of sixmnar politiEcs, and, by a sort of confusion of ideas, this stigma more or less attached itself to the Liberal party generally. Hence thereturn of Wynne, Tottenlam, and Eand ock and hence, too, would follow the substitution of a Conservative for a Liberal in very many boroughs and counties. Everything would have assisted such a result. There was no angry sectarian question to agitate the minds of the people;- thepriests had little temptation or excuse to repeat the SCenes of 1852, and without such counterbalancing influences the landlords would in most cases have succeeded in returning their own quiet, respectable, deadlylvely nominees, in preference to any clever adventurer who might 'stop the way.' All this, however, has been changed. Mr. Spooner has given a lever to the Roman Catholic clergy which will be worth ever so many seats to them. In the next general election ' Maynooth' will be to the Tories what the Ecclesiastical Titles Act was to the Whigs; and we shall have a renewal of that angry sectarian feeling which has made an election in Ireland a subject of dread to every well-wisher of his country." Meanwhile the storm is brewing, the first sounds of which come from a ouarter never yet suspected of lukewarmness in the sustainment of any plan of agitation, and -more especially when the established church is the object of attack*- " A stir is beginrni to be made against the monster grievance of Ireland. The revenues of the established church are enormous, and it is the bounden duty of the State to appropriate them to secular purposes of public utility. Mr. Spoonerhaving^ shown whiat is to be expected from hisnarty and the majority of the Eouse of Commons, the peeple of Ireland will not do their duty to themselves unless they commence at once to take means to see justice done in the reduction of the temporalities of the establishment within apostolic dimensions. The corporations of Iceland, as exponents of the popular voice, should take the initiative, and o-e are well pleased to see that notice has been already given byl Mr. Oullen, in the Limerick Town Council, to the effect that he will move a petition to Par-liament for the appropriation of the revenues of the establishment to purposes of public utility. Let us see every Irish corporation doing the same." SATUrRDAY EVxNMO. TEE DISARRIA2NT. The Eeniv g Post has been furnished with the following sketch of the interview on Fridaybetween certain coloinels of Militia reginents and the Secretary of State for War, to lay before his Lordship and the Government the position in which certain officers of Militia would be placed on the regiments of -lilitia being disbandedc The following, among others, attended .-Colonels Wilson Patten, 31!P; Burke, M.P.; mnox Gore, Lieutenant of Sligo; Smyth, M.P.; Williams, MYP.; Ousley Higgins, MLP.; Sir J. Yarde Buller, M.P.; Pinney, M.P.; Duncombe, 1W?.P.; Cavendish, 1IM.P., &c. - "Colonel Wilson Fatten, 3LP., opened the case by explaining that the subaltern officers of Militia had in many cases, perhaps unadvisedly, given up lucrative employments to take commissions in the Militia, bGeing anxious to serve their country, and thinking the force might continue embodied for a considerable time. He also mentioned thc case of quartermasters and surgeons. "- Colonel Knox Gore supported the case made by Colonel Patten, and called the attention of lord Panmure besides to the very ufortunate pecuniary position in which noncommisoned offioers of the Stffofthe Militia,but who had been promoted to commissions in accordance with the same systemn as the Line, would be pl!ed. These men were most deserving, and brought first-jrte charcters and services from the Line into the Militia-had by their ability and exertions mainly contributed to the organization of the Eilitia, and had been rewaarded by being raised a class inseciety, a position which they could not support if they were throw,n back, not to the same pecuniary position as before, hut a much worse one. HIe also reminded his Lordship that paymasters, and surgeons, and assistant-surgeons were required to be persons of inteligence and education, and they undertoolk mnuch responsibility, and they had relied on the force continning embodied10 years, wheen they wotld be entitled to retired allowance ; and, now that the country was blessed with pe e, they might be entitled to consideration. " Colonel Sir J. Y. Buller, MYL., mentioned the case of the surgeon of his regiment. " Lieutenant-Colonel OnsleyRiggins, MP, most strongly supported the views expressed by the preceding speakers, referring to the half-paygiven tosubalterns of Militia at the end of the last war as a proeedent for now giving them compensation. A ronversation took place, in which severl members of the deputation took part. "LordPanmure entered fiuly and cordiaUyvith' the deputation into the suabject, and said ho was very glad to have seen them and heard the views of gentlemen to whom the country was so much indebted. He would lay all the mxtters discussed before the Cabinet next day, as they were worthy of every consideration, and he would afterwards take an opportnnity of fuUy stating the views of the Government on the subject."

LO2NDON, ACOiDAY, APRIL 21, 1856. Few people are reconciled to the endurance - cf an injustice by learning that somebody else ],as received a sign<al mark of kindness at the hands of the wroxtgdoer. Favour show n to another person only envenoms the injury, because it shows that the injury flows not so much from the general character of the injurer, as from special ill-will and animosity. Tiese, or something like them, must be the feelings with which every Roman Catholic in Ireland must peruse the proceedings of the THuse of Commons during the past week, limited as they ha-ve been, so far as their interest is concerned, to matters purely ecclesiastical. The Holuse of Commons is of no sect and of no creed. It is formed by a contribution from every variety of Christian sect, and it is only by an accident, by the retention of a clause inserted for another pur,pose, that it is even entitled to call itself an iexclusively Christian Legislature. From such a body we have no right to expect any theological or doctrinal Niews whatever, but we have a right to require that, standing as the House does, indifferent in its collective capacity between all shades of religious opinion, it should observe the most perfect impartiality, and mete out justice to all men of all creeds on principles quite distinct from the truith or falsehood of their tenets. To relieve all denominations of Christians at the expense of the State, or to relieve none, is a course of conduct perfectly clear and intelligible, but to select one class of Dissenters for encouragement and another for proscription is a course which the coiuntry cannot but unequivocally reprobate, as neither consistent with the dignity of the assembly wlhich sanctions, it, nor consistent with justice and fairplay to the people injured by it. The parties that came before the House of Comnmons last week seeking for justice are the members of the Church of England living in Ireland, the Irish Presbyterians and Unitarians, and the Irish Roman Catholics. Let us see how their common mother, the State, speaking through her most accredited organ, the House of Conmnons, deals with the wants and wishes of dutiful children, whom she is bound to cherish and regard alike. The members of the Church of England ask from her the right of taxing, under the name of " Ministers' MNloney," their Roman Catholic fellow-citizens as well as themselves residing in the eight principal tow.ns in Ireland for the purpose of maintaining clergymen of the Church of England, in excess of the revenue arising from the property already enjoyed by a Church wvhich barely counts a menmber for every pound of its yearly income. T'he House of Commons has nothing to refuse to the Church of the minority, seeking legal authority to enrich itself still more at the expense of the majority, and so Mlinisters7 Money is cheerfully granted. Then come the Irish Roman Catholics, doomed to bear the whole biurden of our ecclesiastical system, and representing, as it seems to us not vel-y nreasonably, that Parliament has taken away from them those revenues which before the Reformation were their own; that their congregations are extremely poor, and can only supply their clergy with the barest pittance, and that for this reason it is almost impossible to obtain priests possessing the requisite amount of education. Things being thus, the Irish Roman Catholics urge the House of Commons not to take from them a small grant whichi has enabled them to bring up a peasant clergy capable of encoiuntering the poverty and privations which await a priest doomed to subsist upon the bounty of his fleck, and of providing the clildren of the Church with the comforts at least of the religion in which they live and die-their guide on this side of the grave and their hope on the other. Vho could suppose, who bears in mind the treatnment experienced in the matter of Ministers' MNoney by the clergy of the rival clhurch, that so reasonable a petition could be refused ? But it is so, nevertheless. The House of Conunions rejects the prayers of the Roman Catholics, and, -while she can refuise nothing, however superfluouis, to the clergy of the Church of Ireland, QrtIdges the barest necessaries of existence to her pcor and shivering sister. DIVES has his good things and IAzAxus his evil things. To the church that has is given, from the church that hIS not is taken away even that which she ha'h. MIuch has more, and little less; poverty is made poorer, wealth richer; and this by a Legislature whose first duty as a faithfiul steward of the public money is a rigorous impartiality in the . pportionmnent of its gifts. But this is not all. Next come the Irish Presbyterians and Unitarians, and request that 40,0001. a-year may be allotted to them for the payment of their clergy. To them, also, the State has nothincg to refuse. WYhat though they are a small minority in their native land,-what though the Unitarians at least differ from the members of the Church of England far more widely than the Roman Catholics,-the House of Commons overlooks and overleaps these paltry barriers and distinctions, and grants the petition of the Irish Protestant Dissenters with as much readiness as that of the members of our own communion. No ore goes away empty-handed, except the churchl of the Irish people, the church of the Irish poor, which administers to those who have no other friends and no other hope, and for her the princely munificence of the British Parliament cannot spare a single farthing. It occurs to us, as no doubt it has occurred to most of our readers, to ask upon what principle are these things done-upon what ground are those who do them prepared to justify them ? If it be suggested that the House of Commons will cnly open the purse of the nation to a faith uhich is kindred to that of the great majority of its members, how, then, we ask, does it happen that ve have public aid given to Unitarians, -who deny the very groundwork of our religion? If it be said that we regard necessity in what we do, we answer that the necessities of the Roman Church in Ireland are a thousand times more pressing than those of any other sect, and that in this, as in all other matters, the Legislature ought to have ears for the cry of the poor as well as for the claims of the rich. If it be said that it is our policy to starve out the Roman Catholic Church by reducing it to a state of inanition, we answer that no policy can be more unjust, more cruel, or more futile. Law and reason have alike decided that we have no right to prescribe the religion of our fellow-subjects, and that we ought to follow in our grants of money the same rules as in our grants of rights. Such policy is dangerous, because it justly irritates a whole race whom it is our duty, as well as our interest, to conciliate ; and it is futile, because by this pecuniary persecution of the Roman Catholic Church we strip her of her more repulsive attributes and bind her only more firmly round the heart of the Irish nation. Clothed in purple and fine linen, meddling in Courts and intrigues, the Church of Rome has ever borne up with difficulty against the scandals which her owvn worldly and intriguing priesthood has created, but stripped of glitter and luxury, compelled by necessity to be pure, abstemious, and simple, praying beside the bed of her penitents in a stifling hovel, or preaching beneath the dripping roof of a dilapidated chapel, the Church of Rome, with all her errors, commands, and will receive, a respect never withheld by the heart of man from really disinterested devotion to any cause, while her well-paid rivals, professing, as we believe, a purer creed, and inculcating, as we think, a higher morality, may command cold. assent or apathetic acquiescence, but cannot supply the eloquence that comes with such force from the lips of a Church struggling with poverty and steeped in misery.
The Treasury presents its Estimates to the House of Conimons as a small tradesman presents his little bills. In a country town a good customer never knows what he has to pay; there is always something additional. The account once opened, it becomes a sort of wound which it would be unsafe to close; the door once opened to the village carpenter or builder, he haunts the house for ever like a rat or a ghost; your morning slumbers are disturbed by the noise of falling tiles, and you eat your dinner to the sound of eternal hammering. The job is always half-done, and when in a fit of disgust you tell Jom to get that man's bill and dismiss him, he can't get it, and he can't dismiss him; the man has something stiU on hand, and before he makes up his account he has to wait for the account of some other man, of name unknown, whom he employed in some incomrrehensible work of detail-a lock or a pipe, or nobody knows wvhat. So it fared with the celebratel Mr. BmrGCs, and so it happens to the House of Commons. There is no end to the bill, and the House that votes milions upon millions without a grudge is asked for a few thousands more, in the sam3 peddling spirit with which a petty tradesman, whose yearly bill has just been paid in faUll, as was fondly imagined, bothers one about 3s. 6-1d. for extra work. There was a good deal of confusion in the Estimates, as we have gone over them ahleady, but we were not prepared for the further confusion in the series of Estimates, No. VII., which are devoted to " Mis" cellaneous, Special, and Temporary Objects," and are to come before the House to-night. From these it would appear that the public accoumts are like a lady's letter-a series of postscripts stretching to infinity, small by degrees and beautifully less. It was bad enough that we should have the Post-office accounts mixed up in three different series of estimates-first of all in those of the revenue departments, then in those of the navy, lastly, in those of the public departments genenully; and perhaps our readers will not be able to comprehend by what strange process these accounts should come to be so divided. It must therefore be explained that in the first -vote we have an estimate for the working of the Post-office, in the second an estimate for the packet service, while in the third we have a separate estimate of the sumI required for the postages of the navy and other public departments. There is something in this last item that shows a genius for confusion in the Trcasury, the cost of postage for the navy being charged neither to the debit of the Admiralty nor to the credit of the Post-office, but to a thirdc account called "General Expenses." And then I there is a fourth account still required for the superannuation allowances of the Post-office, while I in the report of the PosTAsdTErz-GEN-EitA and in the accounts of public income we have a fifth statement of postal returns. All this is very absurd, and the worst of it is that the same vicious system pervades all the Estimates. If we take up any one item at random, it is impossible to state what is the total sum which is devoted to it, and in how many different papers it is stated. The army and navy medals, for example-who shall compare the Estimates of last year with those of the present year, and tell whether we shall discover the final vote for it tunder the head of the Almy or of the Navy, of the Mint, or of the " Temporary Objects" whichl have given rise to these remarks ? The sunm which is demanded in these Estimates amounts to 450,0001. The variouis charges that go to make up this total are paltry enough, but the more trifling these charges are the greater right have we to complain that they were not included in the original accounts. They are the last feathers that break the public patience; they illustrate a system which, when it comes to these details, is too ridiculous and too troublesome to be borne. Here, for instance, are a number of votes asked for various commissions-for Statute Law, for Common Law, for Chancery, for County Courts, for Civil Service, for Linacy in Scotland, for Endo-wed Schools in Ireland. Comnmon sense surely requires that the expenses of these commissions should be classed under their several departments-the Law Commissions under Law, the Civil Service Coiniission under the expenses of the Public Departments, and the Endowed Schools Commission inder the Educational grant. Wl7ho can tell us wlhat is voted annually for Education and Science ? We have just mentioned one item; there is a further suIn in the present estimates for Professors at Cambridge, in the Army Estimates we hear of so much for WVoolwich, in theNavyEstimates of so much for theGreenw%ich Observatory, and so on, a few pounds here and a few pounds there. Here, again, we are asked for 5001. for the Lunacy Commission in Scotland; in the Estiiates No. II., for the "Public Depart"ments," 1,310?. is asked for the " contingent expenses of the Commissiolers in Lunacy," and ten times that sum is paid, besides, out of the Consolidated Fund. Is it monstrous to expect that all these sums should be classed together, and that we should k;now at once what is required under any one head of service? Here, too, we have sums demanded for BatterseaPark, forChelsea embankment, for Windsor improvemenits, for Embassy-houses, for Consulate buildings, for Lighthouses, for the Irish .National Gallery. It is difficult to understand why these votes are not classed under the head of "Public Works," or something else more appropriate than the stupid heading of " Tempo" rary Objects." For the police at Aldershott 7,5001. is asked; why was not this asked under the head either of "Police" or of the " Army ?" It wiiU be observed that we object principally to the manner of stating the accounts, but we have equally good grounds for objecting to some of the charges themselves. What, for instance, is the meaning of this 7,5001. for the police at Aldersliott ? Cannot the soldiers be made to tak-e care of themselves? The heroes of discipline, the creatures of drill, require a lot of policemen to keep them in order ! It is a specimen of how all our public departments are managed, not one of them being self-sufficient, but every one requiring to be patched up by auxiliary departments and reported upon by extempore conimissions. Throughout these Estimates we find the same absurd want of unity, and the same wasteful expenditure. Under the Patent Law Amendment Act, it is stated that 8,4001. is required for " fees to law officers of the CRo-wv in " England." The sum is enormous, and, even were it reasonable, it surely belongs to a different page of the national ledger. It will be fur- ther found that under the same act 4,522?. is to be voted for " compensations." The Patent Clerk to the A TTron y and SOIcOITORGENERAL gets under this head S5O I.-a sum greater than the half-pay of an Admiral, double that of the general clerk of the Enclumbered Estates Commission, and equal to the compensation allowed to the LoRi-ADvocATE for Scotland. The ATTORN.EY-GEERAL and SOLICTOR-GENBAL for Ireland get betwreen them 2,0001., and we are puzzled to know why these gentlemen, together with the LoP,-ADvocATE, should not meive sufficient salaries, stated once for all, and whether these " compensations?' are to be continued to the subsequent holders of their offices? We are very sure that the pyblic will not long endure to have its financial statements in such inextricable confusion. It would be a disgrace to the petty tradesman whose transactions seldom get beyond the column of shillings, or to the publican who chronicles smalI beer in chalk on the back of a shutter, if his accounts were thus involved in confusion. It is not simply a disgrace-it is criminal, that in the first mercantile country in the world tle accounts of a Government which expends nearly 100,000,0001. a-year-a sum easily w ritten in figures, but which no imagination can grasp-should be kept in such a manner as to make it impossible to discover what is our ex- penditure, and to expose the country most certainly to all the evils of jobbery and peculation.
Those who have had opportunities of observing have seldoin failed to disparage, and almost to condemn, the matrhionial alliances of Englishmen with the coloured natives of the tropics. However engaging the manners, or graceful the figures, cr affectionate the dispositions of these deep brunettes, they, somehow or other, don't make good wives for English husbands. They can't work and they don't talk. When they chatter it is on topics which don't interest their lords, and when they are silent they do not employ their silence on works of domestic utility. Unable to amuse and ceasing to attract, they simply bore their husbands, who find in the partners of their choice neither reciprocity of conversation nor sympathy of sentiment. The laissez-aller maxims of India prove but ill-accordant with English notions of domestic economy, domestic comfort, and domestic discipline. At last the mutual admiration, which a less close alliance might have allowed to remain intact, melts away beneath the familiarity of a more intimate acquaintance. It is the same sort of thing with our Indian politics and our Englisli Parliament. No two things can be more dissimilar and unsympathizing -no two things should be kept more distinct and separate. If ever they touch, it should be only in obedience to some fixed law of political dynamics compelling infrequent contact. And for this reason,-because the natives of India are as unlike as possible to the constituency of Great Britain in thoughts, feelings, habits, and opinions; because everything said or debated publicly in England on Indian subjects is sure to be misunderstood, perverted, or exaggerated by the people. of India; and because only an imperfect and partisan view is likely to be adopted by the disputants on Indian politics in Parliament. Take Sir E. PEnny's parenthetical dissertation on Fsiday night. IWhat good object could be served by it? A gentleman who has been fortunate enough to be pastured for ten years on the best paid service under the Crowx, and is at this moment receiving a pension sufficient to inoculate with janundice all the members of the home service, selects for his assault the policy wvhich almost every Indian Governmenit in succession has felt itself obliged to pursue, and every English Administration to affirm. He takes the opportunitywliich the forns of the House allow of directing his oblique attack against a system -which he condemns as unjust, and its results, which he deplores as most ruinous. He represents us as extorting province after province, and plundering nabob after nabob. He is followed by otlhers, who reproach the Indian Administration with every crime, from the meanness of the most ignoble fraud to the cruelty of the most aggressive violence; and they all reproach it with the worse infamy of a falling revenue. Now, what good end does this serve? If the whole of our indian policy has been bad, let it be brought formally before Parliament. Let resolutions be proposed to both Lords and Conmmons denouncing, in express terms, the principle of annexation and the practice of extravagant expenditure. Let the resolutions be fairly debated. Let those -who are cognizant of Indian affatirs bring down their information, disprove the statements of the assailants, if they can, or, if they can't, yield to them. In one case let the resolutions be negatived, the question dismissed, and the irritating theme consigned to a long slumber; in the other, let the resolutions be carried, a policy based upon them, and instructions in accordance with them be sent out to the Indian Govermment to execute-if it can. Buht do not let us have these petty occasional carpings at a great system of government, wvhich, -whether bad or good, is far too important to be talked away. Let us not be teaching the Indian people that oii hold upon the Peninsula is so loose that they need but appeal to some fanatical society, in order to get up an agitation which may begin by recommending the restoration of a provinice, and end by dictatincg the cession of an enmpire. Let IIs not so discuss the nmorbid anatomy of our own Indian administration as to leave no escape for ourselves between the dilemma of conscious wickedness and deliberate hypocrisy, and teach our Indian subjects that we are peddling on in a career of juggling despotism without even the satisfaction that we can make it " pay." The affectation of strength has sometimes, served to supply the reality; but the ostentation of imbecility or iniquity is ever fatal to the man or the State that is thoughtless enough to exhi1bit it. Every revelation of the thousand plots that are woven in the -web of Indiana history shows howv keenly alive the people of the Peninsula are to the slightest hint and the faintest rumours of our failing revenue or our failing strengtlh. Let it be borne in mind that our Eastern empire rests, not on the concurrence or equipoise of opinions, as in Europe, but on faith, -faith in our power to maintain what we possess and-to punish those who would assail us. Ehake this faith, and you sow the seeds of ten times as many wars as the most determined annexation would excite. .Annexation is an injustice, a crime. Such is the thesis of Sir E. PERzRY and Mr. OTwAy. But within what limits of time and place? Is it since the Deccain was added, or the Carnatic ? Have these gentlemen ever asked themselves this question-What and where would be our Indian empire without annexation ? They say it is unjust to annex Oude, as it was unjust to annex Scinde. But do they forget that other and richer provinces have been annexed before Scinde and Oude ? Would they reduce our whole Indian establishment to the twin factories of Fort William and Fort George ? Their argument takes a,way gradually State after State and province after province, till nothing would remtain for us but the condition of permissive trade in a shabby suburb or two on the seashore. Do they seriously contemplate such a consummation ? And, if they do, can they seriously believe that the natives of India would really gain by a renewed subjection to the old indigenous despotisms, with their tortures, their slavery, their confiscation, and their revolutions ? As it is, the British government of India, even with all its faults, represents the one solitary system of order and stability known to the people. Compared with the empire and the petty Governments which it has superseded, it is the Paradise of justice and moderati5n and repose. Its abolition would reduce the natives to a subjection which would equal slavery, or to an anarchy which would equal -the worst kind of civil war. The fact is, we annex not because we wa4t territory, but because *we desire peace. We annex tQ get orderly citizens whom we can restrain, instead of disorderly neighbours whom we cannot. A licentious Court, with its implied consequence of a turbulent and conspiring people, or a robber Prince with his freebooting retainers enjoying full swing in the heart of our dominion', must each be rooted out for the safety of all about them. Every Governor-General has begun by protesting against annexation, but almost every one has been forced by cii'cumstances to annex. Had it not been foi4iord WELLESSI. Y'S bold policy against the Alabrattas, what of India would have been left for us to defend against the Siklbs? and 'without the annexation of the Punjab wheat would have been the chance and the cost of future defensive wars ?
The controversy with regard to St. James's Park has been brought to a point which, if not considered as a final one, is satisfactory enough. There is to be a road fromn the end of St. James'rstreet to Buckingham-gate. This road will be cut between Marlborough-house and St. James's Palace. It will be carried along the paved road into the Mall, and so in front of the Palace to Buckingham-gate. Thus Belgravia and London are for the first timie brought into close connexion. We should have been more grateful for the concession had it been less tardily made, but at any rate there it is at last. The isolation of so principal a quarter of the town as the one which is known as Belgravia was one of the greatest defects in the ground-plan of London, and should long since have been remedied. The expense of making this road, including the removal of the German Chapel, will be 21,9001., the chief portion of -which sum1 will, of course, be expended in the removal of the building. The operation is to be performed on a far more extensive scale than we had contemplated, but we freely adnmit that the removal of the chapel and the wider entrance to the Park will be great improvements. The sum required is, after all, trifling enough, when compared with the consequences of the minutest blunders of the War Department, and the blunders of that department are not often minute. We are most happy to add, that the idea of bisecting the beautiful gardens with a carriage-road is definitively given up. There is, indeed, to be a bridge across the Ornamental Water, but for footpassengers only. This will be a great convenience to the inhabitants of that new district which is now rising between Westminster Abbey and the Belgravian squares. We have not a word of objection to offer to Sir Bz3Tium- HAL's plan as far as it goes, but two further changes are necessary before the Park is fully opened,-that is to say, a communication between Pall-mall and Storey's-gate, and an entrance or access from Spring-gardens. We cannot, however, say that there has been any very loud expression of opinion upon either of these points. It is obvious enough that if there be a good openinig at Marlborouigh-house the simple difference will be that the traffic from the city will pass along Pall-mall in place of along the Mall in St. James's Park. It will, no doubt, in the end, prove the wiser course to connect St. James's Park with Charing-cross, for such an improvement would add great beauty to that quarter of the towvn as well as ease the traffic; but there is no occasion for precipitancy or undue haste. It is most certain that now the Park is partially thrown open it will in the end be thrown open on every side. Thus, then, two great objects have been obtained, -we have saved St. James's-gardens, and we have obtained a commumication between Belgravia and the remainder of the town. Sir :BEsJAan HEAL, in the course of his explanation of Friday night, informed the House that it was his intention to carry out the third recommendation of the committee. This was to the effect that a road should be opened from Waterloo-place to the Mall, terminating near Storey's-gate. -Sir BrnJ M so far disregards the suggestion of the conumittee that he proposes to leave the Duke of Yonx's pillar standin g where it is, and to lead the road oneithersideof itinto the Park. There appears to be a certain difficulty with the lessees of the houses on Carlton-terrace. In their leases a covenant was originally introduced to the effect that they were to have the uninterrupted use of the terrace from east to west. Nlot long afterwards an entrance was cut into the park, and, in consideration of tlhis, and after due consultation with the lawyers, the ground-rents of the Carltonterrace lessees were reduced. The question is,did this reduction only cover the existing entrance for foot-passengers, or can this be conveirted into a carriage-road without infringement of their rights P This is a question wvhich we must leave Sir BELNrAnx HALL to settle wvith the lessees; but, in the neantimie, is there any reason -why the road should not be opened from the base of the steps to Storey's-gate ? The most important points have already been obtained. St. James's-gardens are preserved for public use and enjoyment, and the inhabitanits of one of the richest quarters -of the iown are relieved froni isolation. We congratulate them and all Londoners upon the result, :nd would only ask in addition that this road across the Parade, which is ready for use, should be no longer closed.
The Board of Inland Revenue have received the s um of 21. 6s. 8d. fiom " MI. A." for unclaimed income-tax, Burna ADULTERA,TED wN= FLiNi-STo-Sy .- Astounding as is the announcement at the heading of this paragraph, it is nevertheless true. Butter is adulterated vith flint stones. This heartless and wicked fraud is especiaBy practised in the low kinds of butter usuaUy sold in large manufacturing tovins to the poorer and industrious populaticn. The dint stones are ground and then chymnically manipulated, until theyare reduced into a soluble substance, =hichis known by the denomination of "soluble silica." When this latter preparation is dissolved in water it becomes a stiff gelatinous body, somevhat resembling strong jely. Thisjellyis mixed to a considerable extent with butter of lowv qualty, to which fresh salt and colouring matter are added. The product of this villanous adulteration is a compound which resembles a very good-looking dairymade butter. Bat it has not the firmnness or brigt appearance of genuine butter, and is devoid of the ricnness and wvholesome qualities of the latter. We have seen this gross adulterati an at the Laboratories of the Northern Aalytical College. Sheffield, aild we are credibly informed that Professor Calvert, of Mlanchester, has detected this fraud recently and frequwntly. Such is one phase of the adulterating system. It is a near approach to, if not a verification of, the poor man "asking for bread, and having a stone given to hini." If such unprincipled sophistications are not soon doVe away with by stringent laws and public condemnation, it will end in our better halves treating ourselves and friends with luxurious gastronomic entertainments, in which fint stones, lime, sloe leaves, and sand will form the chief ingredients of the family spread; and we shall be enabled to ask our particular friends to come and take a cup of sloe tea, -with a little " toast and flint," gravel, constipation, and diarrhoA included. Surely some legislative interference might be brought to bear upon the subject, if it were only to compel the vendors to placard on their goods the rzal quality. We should then be edified by show-cards announcng the tempting truths, as "FBlint Butter," "Turmeric Mustard." "V5itriol Vinegar," "Carrot Coffee," and "Chalk Sugar-plaums"-Donccstcr Oanetie.

TEE BAND IN KEASINTGTO-A GARDENS. Yesterday the band of the Royal Horse Guards Blue played again in Kensington-gardens, when-owing, doubt. less, in a great measure, to the magnificent weather-very nearly twice as many people were assembled as on the Sunday previous. The band may be said in some degree to have redeemed its reputation, while the authorities con. cerned in the selection of the music eertainly did more honour to their audience and to the occasion which had attracted so vast a crowd. With this admission we have also to record that-probably in deference to the zeneral disapproval created by last Sunday's performance-the very opposite extreme was adopted. Instead of a programme composed of vulgar dance tunes, we had now one exclusively devoted to sacred music of the gravest character. The war march of the Levites, from Mendelssohn's thaliiah, selections from Rossini's Stabat Mater, a chorus fromn Haydn's C0eation (" The Heavens are telling "), two choruses from T27hc elksiah (" The glory of the Lord " and "Hallelujah "), and an " Ave Maria " of Cherabin, were the chief ingredients. All these (arranged. for a military orchestra with ingenuity and effect, we presume by MIr. Tutton, theband-master-an excellent and practised musician) were more or less well performced-and indeed, with one exception (Hande's "Hallelujah "-which wa, taken so quick, and executed so coarsely, that nearly all its grandeur and dignity were lost), as wel as could reasonably have been expected. The remarlis it was our duty to malke last week may possibly have induced this absolute netamorphosis. If so, however, they were not e xactly appreciated. In advocating the principle of affording rational and innocent amusement to the people in the shape of musical performances on Sunday, after the hours set apart for Divine service, we objected to its being offered in so utterly trivial and unedifying a form. We felt convinced that the audience was too good for the music, and that, had such an entertainment been provided for them elsewhere and under other circumstances, it would have been repudiated rith contempt. But we did nut mean by this that th3 Sunday programme should be entirely made up of pieces of a grave and uncompromising character. The fault of vesterday's performance was its extreme monotony. All the compositions were very good, but they were too much of a colour. In the selection from the Siabatillatcr, for instance, three long pieces immediately succeeded each other in 2inor 7eys-the "Pro peccatis," the " Inflammatus," and the fuguedf7ina7c. Now, it is more than probable that the difference between major and minor keys, and the precise nature of a fugue, were as far from the comprehenLion of 99 out of 100 present as the peculiar philosophy of the Rosicrucians; nevertheless, although its scientific distinctions mnight have been caviare to the multitude, the effect of so great a prevalence of sombre music was felt, and the general impression derived from the performances was one of heasviness, if not of actual bore. Wie heard-and were delighted to hear-more than one artisan recognize the choruses of Handel and Haydn; but the three long pieces in minor keys, from Rossini's Staba5, were evidently oppressive, even to these intelligent psrsons. Why not contrive an agreeable nz77ange 1 By no meaas resort to polkas, galops, and waltzes; but let the piec s from oratorios and masses be discreetly varied with secular music, such as the overtures of WVeber, Rossini, Auber, &c.; slow movements, or scdcrzi, from ths symphonies of .Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn; reminiscences from the operas of ?deyerbeer and others, which, although what is conventionally termed profane music never, -we are convinced, engendered anything worse han harmless delight in the minds of listeners. No e would object to passages from the poets being read or pictures ef the great painters contemplated on a Sunday.; there can, therefore, be no reason why beautifuil musicwhich is just as edifying and just as innocuous-should not be heard wvith impunitv. We demur to mere unmitigated triffing on week-days, much more on the Sabbath ; and for this reason, while criticizing yesterday's perforimance as too unifonnly grave, we are compelled to recur to that of the week previous as trivial and irrelevant. Let the will, however, be taken for the deed. The intention, yesterday, was good; and the whole proceeding,balancing merits and defccts, were entitled to respect. Thg crowd, though so much greater, was quite as well behaved as the other, and everything passed off with such nmmistakeable gratification to al present that there is reason to hope the question, -whether the mass of people in this immense metropolis is better employed on Sundays in healthful recreation out of doors than in gloomy and silent seclusion, may be looked upon as settled. Before quitting the subject of the music in Kensingtongardens we must once more protest against the general shabbiness of the proceedings. Why sbould there be only one regimental band when it would be easy to combine two or three?-why should the performersbe ill-accomunodated? -and why, since it might be effected so easily and at a mere nominal outlay, is not the platform so constructed as to render the band both visiblo and audible to the m3jority ? At present-we repeat-it can neither be heard nor seen with anything like distinctness, unless by those who do not care about personal discomfort in the search after Dleasure.
HA YAARKET THEATRE. The engagement of ZEss Talbot at this house has led to the revival of the once favourite farce Grimswhaw, Bagshaz, and ruds7uiaw, which seems likely to acquire a new lease of popularity. As the plot is of a lndthat can hardly be rendered intelligible in the absence of ocular inspection, we shall not endeavour to refresh the memory of onr playgoing readers by recounting with full detail the troubles which fall on the head of Mtr. Grinnshaw -when he inconsiderately allows an impenous young milliner to take possession of his apartment for purposes of her own, and the frequent annoyances to whicli he is subjected, when he is taken successively for Messrs. Bagshaw and 3radshaw, who xesemble him in nought, save the last syllable of their names. We have already said enough to revive tho old talo of confusion in the minds of those who witnesed it when it was first produced, *vhile, with respect to those who have never xeen the piece at aLl, any attempt to convoy a notion of thie "fun" by means of narration would utterly fail of its object. One profitable remark may, however, be made in reference to the revival-namely, tbat there is no other piece.in which the peculiar humour of 3Mr. Buckstone and Lis despotismn over the risible muscles of his audience are more completely displayed. The situations in which Grimshaw is placed are ludicrous, and his dialogue abounds in quaint absurdities; but these pleasantries, verbal aud practical, form ihe mere canvass into which the actor works his fantastic drollery. There is scarcely a word, a gesture, may, scarcely a pause, that does not find out the seat of laughter somewhere, and awaken a spontaneous ebullition of mirth. Let us not forget to add that the lovely, imperious millineris adequately represented as to both these characteristiesby the stately MIiss 1lal oot.

THE BEVIEW AT ALDERBSHOTT. There was a briliant field-day at Aldershott on Saturday, and the large concourse of visitors who, despite the weather, assembled on the moors bad the gratification of witnessing one of the finest nilitary spectacles presented since the formation of the camp. Her Majesty and Prince Albert, vrho, with their suite, had arrived at the camp on Friday afternoon, and slept at the Pavilion that night, took a lively interest in the proceedings. Among the nobility present were, the Duke and Dachess of Richmnond, Lord Hardingo, Lordand Lady Bllesmere, the Earlof Cardigan, Lord Elcho, M.P., &-c. His Royal Highness the Duke of Canibridge, attended by h is aide-de-camp, Colonel M'Donald, came down fromm Lon. don by the 7 o'clock train, and at once repaired to the Pavilion. The general place of rendezvous for the troops was a wide expanse of moorland, extending for some miles behind the ancient Romian encampment, and forming a natural plateau, known as Ladyhouse-comnion. Here, at halfpast 10 o'clock, the troops assembled in gay and glittering array, and were formed in lines of contiguous columns; quarter distance. The whole army of Aldershott was present, divided into four brigades, comprising the following regiments :-The 80th and 91st Regiments of the Line, the 3d battalion of the Rifle Brigade, the Antrim Rifles, and the Militia of Sussex, Glocestershire, Leicestershire, Worcestershire, City of Dublin, 5th Elthorne, Hertfordshire, 2d Surrey, lst Sonlersetshire, Kerry, Cambridgeshire, and a few detachments of the Land Transport Corps, making a total strength of something lke 18,000 men. There is little of softness or luxuriance in the surrounding landscape. Its general asnect is bleak and barren, but it has that wild and desolate grandeur which is often more impressive than verdant vaUey or golden corn-field. Its immensity affects the imagination powerfully. The Surrey moors, stretching far as the eye can reach, resemble a sea of heather, interspeTsed with bilowy hills, the "offing," so to speak, dimly defiued by belts of fir and clumps o° thick brushwood. In ordinary times a sense of loneliness comes over the traveller who surveys these desert wastes; but, enlivened by the strains of military music, flashing with swords and firelocks, fluttering wvith flags and feathers, and sparkling with every vXariety of uniform, the scene on Saturday was fulU of Efe, light, and motion, and had every element of panoramic beauty. The contrast of colour wvas complete, and greatly enhanced the brilliancy of the picture. The dark costumes of the Rifles relieved the eye, dazzled wvith "the splendour and the sheen" of scarlet coats, and the effect of light and shade was still further heightened by the contrast between the dusky surface of the heath itself and the white uniforms of the bandsmon. There are fewv trees on these shelterless plains, but these few are of infinite value as elements of the picturesque. In a spot wthere vegetation has no higher development than furzs and heather, a tree, everywhere a beautiful object, beconmes a luxury. The Queen, who arrived on the ground shortly after 11 o'clock, was attended by a brilliant suite and staff, among whiomii were Viscount Hardinge, Sir Frederick Smith, I.E., General ISnollys, Brigadier-General Rutcl,inson, Colonel Grey, Lord Alfred Paget, and Her Majesty's Lady inWVaiting, the Counitess of Desart. Her Majesty was mounted on a chestnut charger, wore a dark ridinig habit w%ith the riband of the Garter, and across her left shoultder a sash of blue and gold. Her hat was decorated with a plume of military feathers. Prince Albert rode on Her Majesty's left, the Duke of Cambridge on her right, and bothworethe unifornisof general officers. ThelPrincesslP.oyal and the Princess Alice followed in an open carriage drawn by four gray horses. As the IRoyal party approached the bands struck up the National Anthem, the ensigns lowered their Icolours, and the troons presented arms. Her Majesty rode leisurely along the Wihole line,which extended nearly a mile, and minutely inspected each regiment, returning the saluta' tions of her soldiers with a grace in which dignity and affabf lity were happily combined. Just as the parade inspection was completed the wind veered suddenly and sharply round to the east, and continued -at that unpopular point of the compass for the rest of the day, so that the flags oE the various regiments, though they had little of the "battle" to brave, had more than enough of the " breeze." The Royal party having dismounted and selected their position on a rising ground General Knollys put himself at the head of the troops, and then commenced a series of evolutions and manceuvres, which, though " familiar as my garter" to professional spectators, were rather more curious than intelligible to civilians. Owing, wve presume, to the absence of cavalry and artillery, there was no attempt at a regular sham battle, and the operations differed from those of forner occasions in this respect, that any representation of an enemy was entirely dispensed with. This threw the spectators completely on the resources of theirown imagination, and hence arosemuch embarrassment and perplexity, which would have been avoided had the anny been divided into conflicting hosts. It was not very easy to understand why the gallant 5th Elthornes, who seemed to be carrying all before them, and to be keeping their own right manfully, should suddenly fly to a new position; or wvhy the Royal 2d Surrey, who defended imaginary trenches w ith an intrepidity that reflected the highest honour on every member of the regiment, from the colonel to the goat, should all at once give way as if driven in on the right flank. The explanation is, of course, that the gallant Blthornes and the heroic Surreys are, like the personages of a Greek play, the victims of an inexorable destiny, and succumb to swords invisible as the phantom-dagger of Macbeth. But all this is not quite so obvious to people who are not of a poetic temperament, or -who may have neglected to cultivate the imaginative faculty. The Rifles took up their position in C esar's Camp, and, inspired by the glorious memories of the spot, performed prodigies of valour. Not Cusar's self could have behaved better. They threw out skirmishers in everydirection, they linedeveryditch, theylurlkedinsidiously in every hollow, they picked down neen like partridges, they hlurled defiance at the foe from the summit of the bill -nay, they came don-n and gave battle to him in the valley; but 'tis not in Rifles to command success, when it is predestined from the foundation of the General's programme thaf they shall not have it. So they retreated-alas, the day !-t and not a man of them would have been left alive had not a brigade of infantry, drawn upin line on the crest of a ridge, come to the rescue, and opened such a mnurderous file fire of blanik cartridge as compelled the unseen enemy to turn tail. The keen wind and cold mist which threatened heavier rain terminated the engagement much earlier than was originally intended. Nevertheless, it lasted for more than two hours, and througli meadow and mountain, moss and moor, the 1'oyal party followed on foot in whatever direction the army marched. When the operations of the day had concluded the troops formed into contiguous line of open columns of companies to salute Her Majesty, the bands playing national melodies as the regiments defiled past the saluting point. At 5 o'clock the Royal party returned to Buckingham Palace. The Earl of Cardigan, attended by Captain Low, was on the ground in the uniferm of his regiment, but, though continually in the proximity of the Court, was not observed to join the Royal party. In our notice of the proceedings at Aldershott on Friday no mention was made of the Kerry Militia, which regiment had the honour of marching past Her Majesty as well as the others enumerated.
COBPORATION REFOBfr BILL. TO THE EDITOR OF TEf TILES. Sir,-Had the corporation of the city of London been able to dispute my figures or refute my arguments, showing the unparalleled extravagance of their expenditure, will any reasonable man believe that they would have let slip the opportunity of doing so to the Royal Commissioner5 before whom my detailed evidence was given? Tliey dared not attempt it, because they knew that every fact and figure was contained in their own publshed accounts. Instead of seizing the opportunity open to them then, they now permit a subordinate officer to publish in your columns a letter the tendency of which is to impugn the accuracy of my statements. S To those who are interested in the matter, and to mem- bers of Parliament in particular, I would refer them to my. evidenco before t,h Royal Commission, beginning with question 2,049, page 203 of the printed minutes, where they will find irrefragable proof that at the Common-hall I un derstated the case. To the public, hotever, I append a condensed balancesheet, the facts of which the Corporation itself supplies. If my figures are wrong, their accounts are incorrect; if their accounts are correct, then no evidence so damnatory to their management-or rather say their nmismanagement -as that wlhich annually they publish to the world can possibly be given. N' Being confident that neither the public nor th' Parliament will permit its judgment, to be warped by the noisy and abusive gatherings of the self-condemned Corloration, I remain, Sir, your faithful servant, I FlANCIS BE4N-OCH. 77, Woocd-street, April 19.

NA VAL AND MILITARY INTEBLIGrENCE. The fleet at Spithead continues to be augmented hourly. The "pivot ships," Rodney, 90, and London, 90, were placed in position on Saturday. The Blenheim, 60, Captain W. H. Hall, C.B., arrived yesterday morning, as did the Seahorse, 12, mortar ship, Captain Lord John Hay, toge. ther with three or four mortar boats, under convoy from Plymouth. The ships are now in two divisions. Vice. Adniral Sir George Seymour has the starboard and Rear. Admiral Sir R. Dundas the port, which latter ships have changed their ensigns and pennants from red (Sir George Seymour's) to white under Rear-Admiral Dundas. The movements to be performed are almost as uncertain as the wind, and all wiiU depend upon the weather. The Commanderin-Chief has prepared his plans, and he has for his guidauce a famous old drawing of the last grand review of the British fleet which took place in 1791-a picture which is now a curiosity. The line-of-battle snips will anchor to the eastward; after them the screw frigates, corvettes, and paddlewheel vessels in rotation. The gunboat flotila will continue in line to tho westward; two divisions in each line half a cable apart to the west of its divisional leader. A stationary line wiiU be formed by the sailingiships Belleisle, Meander,&c. Thepivot ships (Rodney and London) have taken uptheirpositionstotheE.N.E.of the Nab, four cables apart; two other pivot vessels will be similarly stationed at one mile west of Cowes. The Queen's yacht on leaving Portsmouth harbour will steam outside the Gosport shore down to the Cowes end of the line of the fleet, and will then proceed through the entire length of the line, and, as soon as Her Majesty shall have passed the ships at the Nab end of the line, the gunboats will weigh, and wil follow the yacht between the lines made by the line-of-battle ships, &c. An attack will be made upon the Meander, upon Southsea Castle, and Fort Monckton or the Browndown Forts, and Royal Artillerymen and Royal Marine Artillerymen have been marched into the garrison to defend those points in the mimic attack. When all the flotilla shall have passed the flagships the line-of-battle ships will weigh if signal is made to do so, all lowering their flags simoltaneously with the flagships, and then standing out in two columns to the pivot ships and rounding them on the starboard and port hands respectively, manning the rigging, anld cheering as they each pass the Royal yacht. They wv/i return to Spithead in the same order. It is not at all certain that the line-of-battle ships wiU weigh, as it is expectod the anchorage wiU be so crowded with miscellaneous freight ships as to endanger the movement of such large and so numerous a body of ships. The harbour is ordered to be elear of passenger ships by 10 o'clock. Thousands of excursionists were taken to Portsmouth yesterday by the South-Western and Brighton and South Coast Railways, which lines are making admirable arrangements to meet the demands upon thom for accommodation. The lodging departnment is quite a stock-jobbing affair now; the quota. tions are astounding and the prices "firm." The follow*ng yachts are already at the station, and they will doubtlessly be nmerely the forerunners of a large flotilla of similar craft *-Hawk (R. W. Y. C.), Lord Hill; Foam (R. Y. S.), Lord Dufferin; Extravaganza (R. Y. S.), Sir Percy Shelley; Wildfire (R. S. Y. C.), MIr. Tm-ner Turner; Myrtle (R. Y. S.), Mr. John Brown ; Alfred (R. T. Y. C.), AMr. W- D. Cunningham, R.N., &c. The arrangements at Southampton for conveying the members of the Houses of Lords and Commons, the great dignitaries of State, officers of the public departments, and an immense concourse of visitors to the forthcoming naval spectacle are on the largest scale, and from the great size and niumber of the steamshipstobe employedand the pressure for accommodation, the preparations resemble more the f tting out of a great flotilla for some expeditionary ',arlike service thaan the mere catering for a holyday sight. It is calculated that on Wednesday maorning next nearly 70 steamiiships, from the gigantic Himalaya down to the tiny tug, wvill leave Southamapton for the scene of this great national demonstration. The following arrangements have been made: - Her Majesty's steam transport Transit, to carry 400 persons, is appropriated to the members of the House of Peers. the General Screw company's steamship Harbinger acting as tender.. The Perseverance screw steam transport, to carry 450 persons, will convey a portion of the Members of the Conunons, while her Majesty's steamships Widgeon and Monkey and the Turkish yacht will aecompanythat vessel . nd accommodate additional visitors from the Lowver HouseHer Majesty's steamship Vulcan, to carry 400 persons, Holyrood, 20D, and Himalaya, G00-amounting in all t3 1,200-are appropriated to convey the officers of the public departments. Twvo Government tugs will be forwarded from Portsmouth to act as tenders to these last-named vessels. With the exception of the Himalaya and the Harbinger, and thePerseverancea-ndTransit,wlihich.arrivedyesterdaymorning the abovementioned ships will leave Portsmouth to-morrow, owing to the low state of the tide, in the morning, and will anchor in the Southampton Water, so as to enable them to start at an early hour on Wednesday. The majority of the niembers of the Lords and Comnons will arrive at Southampton during Tuiesday, and accommodation having been provided for them in the various vessels many will sleep on loard on Tuesday night. The Himralaya is also arranged with sleeping accommaodation for the number she is ordered to convey, therefore it is presumed that many of the gentlemen connected with the public departments will avail themselves of the preparations thus considerately made for their convenience. This will, no doubt, be almost compulsory, for the difficulty in procuring beds has become so great that those who are not already provided will fini it next to impossible to get them. The Peninsular and Oriental Company have decided upon sending to the review the following ships:-The screw steamers Simla, Alma, Sultan, and Mlanilla, and the paddlewheel ships Ripon and Eaxine. These vessels will convey the directors and shareholders of the company and their friends, each shareholder havinig the privilege of a double ticket. The preparations are on a most sumptuous scale, and refreshments for the day, besides a breakfast and dinner, are. being prepared for between 3,000 and 4,000 persons. The West India Royal -IMail Conipany are not lax in their arringeements. - It-was the previous intention of this com- any to devote to the use of the directors, shareholders, and friends their two paddlewheel steamers Atrato and ,Tay, but, wishing to give every accommodation for the comfort of the visitors, they have determined upon sending in addition the gigantic paddlesteamer La Plata. These vessels will have on board about 2,000 persons, all of whom will have an admirable viewv of the manoeuvres of the fleet. Refreshments, including breakfast and dinner, on the most splendid scale, are provided for all the guests. Owing to the searcity of their ships at present disengaged, the General Screw Company have experienced some difficulty in taking so prominent a position in the proceedings as the two previously mentioned companies. The Queen of the South, the only vessel at home and available (the Harbinger being otherwise engaged), is in the pay of Government as a transport, but application was made to the Lords of the Admiralty for the use of the ship on Wednesday, to convey the shareholders and friends to witness the review. The request was immediately granted. Circulars were then issued and forwarded to each share'holder, jnforming them that, in consequence of the Lotds of the Admiralty having granted the use of the Queen of the South, the directors would be happyto receive the names of those shareholders and their friends who are anxious to be present on the occasion, as arrangements will be made for their conveyanco by that vessel, on the payment of one sovereigu each, which sum will include refreshments. T'he South-Westem Company will send their steamships Courier, Alliance, and Wonder, and the Union Steam Company the screw ships Saxon and Urnion, all of which vessels will convey the public at so much per head. In addition to these, there are chartered by privato individuals the Australian Company's Eteamship Sydney, the Duke of Cornwall, Victoria, Nord, Nimrod, Aquila, Hope, and between 20and. 30 others of various sizes. s, The dock arrangements will be rendered as perfect as possible. A plan has been prepared, showing the place assigned to each vessel as she is to lie alongside the dock quayvs Barrieades will be put up onWednesday morning in various parts of the docks for the purpose of preventing any un. necessary confusion. These divisions will be exclusively used by the different departments as they embark. and boards wil be erected, on which will be painted directions to the particular spots appropriated to the members of the Houses of Lords and Commons, and also the visitors for each steamer. The metropolitan police belonging to the Houses of Parliament will be in attendance, to assist the town and dock police in the preservation of order. There is no doubt that Southampton will be more crowded during the days preceding and subsequent to the review than was ever previously known; and, had it not been for the arrangements of the mail companies, in preparing sleeping accommodation on board the various steamvessels, many hundreds of persons must have remained unprovided during those nights. As it is, there is no doubt that large numbers will be compelled to walk the streets or satisfy themselves with the use of a chair or floor to sleep on. All that is now hoped is, that the day will be fine, which will render perfect a sight which, for magnitude and splendour, wYil probably never again be witnessed upon the waters of the Solent. The Assurance, 4, screw despatch gunboat, Commander William G. Jones, has had her compasses adjusted, and left Sheerness on Saturday last for Portsmouth to join the squadron. The Firefly, 4, paddlewheel steamvessel, Captain Henry C. Otter, left Sheerness on Saturday at 3 p.m. with the new mortar vessels, Nos. 53 and 54, and the Thames, tender to Form'dable, in tow for Portsmouth. Thone moxtz vessels, built by Harvey and Co., dravw only 61 !eet of wrater, with full complement of stores, provisions, shot, a'd shell, -with arMamaent complete. The Wildfire steamvessel, Magter Commander Geor.6 Brocknan, left Sheerness yesterday morning for Portsmouth. Captain Lord Frederich E. Kerr proceeds round in her tobe present at the coming review. It will be seen by the folowing report how some of our flying squadron have been engaged in the Baltic during the last SLX weeks :-The Firefly, which left Sheerness six' weeks since with the mails for the flying squadron, proceeded direct to Kiel, there coaled, thence to Faro Sound, there fell in with the Euryalus, Pylades, Falcon, and Harier. tho Imperieuse being on a cruise up the Gulf of Finland, up which she advanceduntil the solid ice impeded her further progress. The Imperieuse then proceeded to Dantzic to coal, thence she went to Faro Sound, and there received her mails from the Firefly five days after their arrival there. On the arrival of the Firefiy at Faro Sound she was towed through the fixed ice, from six to seven inches thick, a distance of three miles, by'the Falcon screw steamvessel, the paddles of the Firefly being rendered useless. The Firefly then coaled there, and was towed back again by the Falcon to her anchorage. She then took the mails to Kiel, and there found the Majestic and C=sar at anchor. She coaled there, and proceeded again to Faro, Sound. On her passage down she communicated with the Aniphion off Bornholn, the squadron still remaining at Kiiei. She reinained there for three days, When the Pylades and Falcon were sent to cruise off Gottka Sando. The Amplhion and Harier were sent to cruise off Courland. Three days after they left the Cuckoo arrived wvith tho news of peace and with orders to recall the squadron. The Firefly then proceeded to Gottkn Sando to recall the Pylades and Falcon, and thence off Courland to recaU the Amphion and Harier. From off Courland she proceeded to Faro Sound; when off there fell in with the Imp6rieuse, communicated vith her ;during thistime of absence of the Firefly, all the vessels except the Falcon, Cuckoo, and Imp6rieuse, had loft there. The Firefly then, by ordor of Commodore Watson. proceeded up to Gottka Sando in search of the Falcon, and found her off the Island of Gottka. The Firefly, then, being senior vessel, ordered the Cuckoo and Falcon to proceed to Kiel. The Firefly then proceeded to Faro, and there took on board from the Government depot about 15 tons of coals, being all that remained at the depot, all other vessels of the squadron having filled up there previous to their leaving for England. The Firefly then left on the 7th inst. for Kiel. Between Faro and Bornholm fell in with a dense fog. Guns were kept fired and fog signals made, which were shortly answered by several guns. On the Firefly approaching slowvly towards the sound she found the Imperieuse at anchor under Bornhohn. The Firefly anchored there also. On the same evening the fog clearing off, the Imperieuse and Firefly proceeded for iel; there found the flying squadron, except the Falcon and Cuckoo; the latter vessel arrived at midnight of the same day. On the following day aU left for England except the Firefly and Cuckoo. The Firefly coaled during the night, and left on the following day; she anchored off Sprogo the same evening to take astronomical observations, remaining all that day; a, midnight weighed and proceeded to Anholt for a similar purpose; left Anholt in the afternoon, and rounded the Sca;v on the 16th inst., at 6 a.m.; she arrived in the Downs, and anchored at 5 p.m. on Friday, making the run from the Scaw in 59 hours; remained in the Downs 'nine hours for a pilot, then weighed and arrived at Sheernes, at 8.30 a.m. the same day. The Firefly has run over about 3,500 niiles, and expended duling six weeks more than 500 tons of coals. The Thames steam transport, No. 02, Captain Strntt, ar rived at Spithead on Saturday from the Crimea, with the following invalids and passengers:-Lieutenant Charles P. Stokes, 4th Foot (in command); First Class Surgeon J. Paynter, of the Medical Staff; Assistant Surgeon J. Mc H. Cowan, of the 55th; Acting Assistant Surgeon G. Hind; and Hospital-dresser W. Coombe (in medical charge); First Class Staff Surgeon F. Foaker; Captain G. A. Warburton, of the 19th Foot; Captain J. J. Wood, of the 82d; Captain John E. Thring, R.A.; Lieutenant J. Sharples, 39th Foot; Lieutenant Richard Coote, 46th; Lieutenant E. Townshend, 46th; Lieutenant C. H- Wiliams, BMN. ; Rev. G. J. Gill, Chaplain to the Forces . Mr. V. Fogarthy, of the Turkish Contingent; 1 Medical Staff Steward, 14 orderlies, 2 non-commissioned officers, 13 Commissariat bakers, 2 servants, 2 distressed seamen, and the following soldiers and others :-18 of the Royal Artillery, 2 of the Royal Horse Artillery, 1 of the Royal Sappers and Miners, 4 of the Grenadier Guards, 7 of the Coldstream Guards, 7 of the Scots Fusileer Guards, 0 of the 1st Royal Regiment of Foot (2d battalion), 3 of the 4th, 2 of the 7th, 2 of the 9th, 9 of the 13th, 3 of the 14th, 1 of the 17th, 3 of the 18th, 6 of the 19th, 1 of the 20th, 1 of the 21st, 1 of the 23d, 6 of the 30th, 5 of the 31st, 3 of the 33d, 2 of the 34th, 0 of the 38th, 3 of the 39th, 3 of the 42d, 2 of the 44th, 5 of the 46th, 2 of the 48th, 1 of the 50th, 3 of the 55th, 5 of the 56th, 1 of the 57th, 1 of the 63d, 2 of the 6Sth, 1 of the 71st, 2 of the 72d, 1 of the 77th 5 of the 82d, 3 of the 88th, 1 of the S9th, 2 of the 90th, 1 of the 93d, 2 of the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade, of the Medical Staff Corps, 11 of the Land Transport Corps, 1 Commissariat Labourer, and 50 of the Army Works Corps, all -whom she landed at the dockyard in the afternoon, and they pro - ceeded to invalid quarters. Thie freight-ship Hope, of 500 tons register, now lying in the London-docks, is appointed to sail shortly for Halifax. Her magazines have been prepared for storing 40 tons of powder and ammunition, which are ordered to be in readi ness at Woolwich Arsenal, and to be conveyed to Gravesend for shipment on her arrival there. The Government transport Hesper, No. 47, Captain Richard Walling, lay to on Saturday morning off Woolwich Arsenal from Deptford, for the purpose of reshipping her powder. She proceeded thence the same day on her voyage to Plymouth to make up her cargo for the East, with provisions for the troops. In pursuance of the orders for discontinuing the farther despatch of gunboats from Woolwich to Portsmouth, the screw gunboat Cochin, 2, turned over her stores to the Peacock. A telegraphic message was, however, received on Saturday at noon, ordering her to receive fresh stores, and, with the Peacock, to get under way as speedily as possible for the review. Efforts were immediately made for their early clearance, after vhich the fliting basins will be entirely empty, and the caissons are to be thrown open and the water drained off, and a partial holyday is to be given. A number of the clerks who are desirous of witnessing the manceuvring of the ships at Spithead have obtained leave, and are to be accommodated with berths on board the iron screw troopship there, the Megera. Accommodation is likewise to be given on board the Himalaya to the clerks of Whitehall and Somerset-house. On Saturday afternoon the Erebus floating battery w2s launched in the most successful manner from the building-yard of Messrs. Robert Napier and Sons, at Govan, about two miles below Glasgow. On taking the water she dipped deeply on account of the immense weight, and was submerged for a moment or two ,almost to the level of the deck, but as all the port-holes were closed with the exception of those at the bow sho shipped little or no water, and gradually rose upon the reflux of the wave. Two immense chains, fastened to two anchors of the samie weight as those used on board the Duke of Wellington, line-of-battle ship, and which were buried in the earth, covered with immense iron forging plates, acted as a check against the ship touching the opposite side of the bank. When the temporary warp checks on the chains hal snapped, the anchors were drawn forward about two inches and would in all probability have been drawn out alto' gether, but that the chains in the interior of the battery were gradually slackened from the windlass, whereby the Erebus got smoothly across the stream, and was brought up after slightly grazing the north bank, from which, however, she did not sustain the least injury. When afloat the battery drew eight feet four inches of wator aft, and six feet eight inches at the bow. The Erebus left in the evening for Portsmouth, under the command of Captain Case. She is 186 feet long, with a breadth of beam of 50 feet, and a depth of 16 feet. With the exception of being nearly as flat on the bottom as she is upon the deck, she is framed and plated like any ordinary iron vessel; but there is this peculiarity in her c3nstruction that, over the iron hull, for a distance of 12 feet from the top of the gunwales downwards, the vessel is sheathedlwith teak planulngsix inchesinthickness; andthen, again, over the planking, there are massive malleable iron plates no less than four inches thick.. Tbus, with theinside plates, which average from - to A.inch thick, the entire hull of the ship above watermark forms, as it were, an iron and wooden wall of no less than 101, inches in thickness-a wall apparently so formidable as to be capable of resisting the effects of shot of the largest size. The battery is pierced for 30 guns, there being 15 port-holes on each side; and her armament will con3sist of guns 11 feet in length, with an 8-inch bore, and capable of throwving 1001b. shot. She is i upplied with two decks-a gun deck, which is the lower, and an upper or weather deck. The battery has been fitted with seven water-tight bulklheads or compartments, extend. ing from the bottom of the vessel upwards to the gun deck. The`vessel has been constructed under the superintendence of Mr. B. Kneebone, from Her Majesty's Dock-yard at Pem broke. Of the 15 iron mortar-boats ordered of Mr. John Laird in January last, 13 have been sent to Portsmouth, and ie remaining two will leave Liverpool about Wcdneeaay next. Of the 14 wooden gunboats ordered at the end of the last year, tight are now at Portsmouth, and two more-will be launched at g.vepwlol ts-day , d two to-morzo lrom Mr. Uki Birkenhuad yardL They will be ready to proceed to Porta. mnouth in a few days afterwards, the engines having been fitted while the vessels are on the stocks. The two remain. ing boats are ma forwardstate, and wl]lbereadyfor sending to Portsmouth in about three weeks. The large new convict prison, in courxe of erection at Chaitham, in close contiguity to Chathmn dockyard, is rapidly *pproaching towards completion. Wlen finished it will accommodatt nearlyl,500 convicts. Each pisoner will be provided, so far as practicable, -with a cell to imself, the separate system appearing to the authorities the beAsmethod to be adopted. All association among the prisoners will ba avoided, and alterations which have been suggested a&sim. provements on the Model Prison at Pentonville have been careiblly attended to. A large and handsome church has been erected within the prison for the use of the prisoners. The convicts will be employed in the dockyard, with which establishment it is intendedthe prison shall communicate by means of a subterranean passage. It is expected that tha prison will be completed and fit for the reception of prisoners early in the ensuing summer.
THE NEW SOCIETY OF PAINTERS IN 7rATER-COLOURS. As a school, the painters in water-colours are, in some respects, the truest aud most original in England. They are not our greatest painters, for naturally the ambitious artist wi'l employ the more enduring vehicle; but the modesty of their aims must not lead us to forget the merit of these painters and the remarkable influence they have exercised on the whole of English art. Peculiarly national in its origin and development, it is owing to these artists going box and brush in hand to the fields to pourtray nature face to face, and seize upon the spot its most fleeting colours, shades, and forms, that English landacapepainting has taken its present high position; and their iniluence has been felt not merely in landscape, but in every description of painting. That love of colour which we owe to Sir Joshua has been nurtured and increased in this way, and painters in oil have spent days and weeks in endeavouring to attain the transparent shadows and vanishing outlines which are among the peculivr beauties of water-colour. The result, as we have lately had occasion to point out, is too often a mere striving after certain technical effects-the object of the artist being not to paint anything in particular for which he has an especial love, but onlyto paint his anything cleverly. In water colour it is different; the effects come more naturally, and the attention of the artist is given honestly to his sulbject and less to his manner. He paints what he has seen and what he wishes us to see. Hence a certain straightforwardness of purpose and genuineness of work- which, even when faulty or feeble, win our respect; and nowhere more than in the Gallery of the New Society of Painters in Wlater-colours which is to-day thrown open to the public. This exhibition, the 22d, is, on the whole, a very fair one, and if we cannot point to pictures of superabounding merit, stil there are several that wvill be looked at with no small pleasure, and there are many in which the honest and loving labour bestowed on them will be instantly recognized. And, first, of the President, Mr. Henry Warren, who is decidedly Oriental in his views, and, as if to symbolize his connexion with the cameihair-brush, paints camels all over the room. His be picture is tllat of " Rebekah first seeing Isaac ;" and botl for colour and expression the result is good. The sun, of course, is setting as Isaac goes out to the fields to meditate; and, starting with a bright orange horizon, he graduates this above and below with a masterly touch. Above, it melts away into the apple green of the sky, and below, it is tempered down to the dull sand of the foreground; so that, beginning with apple green, he gradually illuminates this until it reachesthe brightest orange in the centre of the picture, and then duls the orange down to the sand. Parallel to this scale of colour he connects the two extremes by a scale of complementary colours, to which blue, the opposite of orange, is the key, and so from the sand the eye rises to the tawny camel, then to the bright blus mantle on the figure that rides the camel, and then awvay to the green sky above. Altogether the balance of the contrasted scales of colour is admirable, and the effect throughout exceedingly harmonious. The action and expression, too, are good, althoughthose of the attendants are better than those of the principal personage. The old nurse is well conceived, and so is the servant pointing out his master. Amid so much excellence it is a pity to find fault; and yet it is necessary to say that the arEst has not been so successful in his management of lines as in that of colour and expression, and that we cannot be expected to swallow so many camels. The picture is very leggy-a forest of legs, and, as if it were not enough to have all these long camels' legs, they are multiplied by shadows still longer and stil more definite. In his othler camel pictures-r. Wlarren has not shined to the same extent; but in one of them he has a fault of another kind which makes it the most remarkable picture in the room. It is the small one-" Meeting the Caravan"-where the shadow of the man in the foreground slants away to the right, that of the camel slanting to the left, so that, if prolonged, they would meet 20 yards off; and if all the shadows in the picture were extended in the direction from wvhich each iscast, they would form the radii of a circle with its centre in the middle of the sand, while the sun, millions of miles away, is innocently looking on, and wondering how on earth the shadows come to be there. A perplexity of a similar kind, although it is not so glaring, occurs in a view of Skiddaw, with Bassenthwaits Lake in the distance, by MIr. Aaron Penley. There is the brilliant light full on one mountain and on the lake below, while the shadow of the near mountain is cast as if the sun were between the two, at the left hand side of the picture. Buit there, on the other hand, are the cowvs with their shadows on the road, as if the sun were on the opposite side. With this exception the painting is adrnirable,and there is a very fine feeling, especially in the shady parts, the more noticeable as this artist is fond of dazzling light-a light so blinding that the necessity of filling up his leading outlines of moiuntain form with careful drawing is avoided. This may be observed in the picture which he has called " Serenity," which is in other respects a fine scene, and where the hairmony of colour, from the delicate violet of the zenith to the red cattle in the foreground, will strike the most cursory observer, as will also that of another scene, "Cornelian Bay," where he has been still more successful. The strength of thne exhibition is in landscape, as was to be expected, and the nanies of W. Bennet, Rowbotham, E. Warren, Mfackewan, Campion, and Carrick, may be mentioned as the painters of some pleasing subjects. A small and unpretending picture by the last of these artists is especially attractive-" B'oys Fishing." It wrould be difficult to describe the serenity of the solitude, efen although the middle distance, right across the picture, is in shadow, and the extreme distance and the foreground in light. The latter is minutely rendered; the sky above might be better; but the boys are perfect in their way, as is also the boy praying in another of this artist's paintings. Boys thus engaged are generally very unlike boys; it is difflicult to bring out at once the bold, free nature of a boy, and the holy feeling of a worshipper. What is to be noticed especially in the landscapes is the natural advantage which so many of the artists have taken of their transparent colours to dwell on reflections in water. Anything for a reflection. In one little sketch a donkey is drawn in the water, for the mere pleasure of drawing him over again legs uppermost, and the two donkeys are pleasantly poised on each other's feet, in a way that, if they could manage it at Astley's, would make the fortune of the proprietor. One of the best of such scenes is "At Kuhn," byW. Bennet; and he has several othersthat are little behind it in depth and transparency of shadow. The artist who has set hlinself most determinedly to the painting of water is Blr. Thomas Robins, who- has contributed some ten sea pieces. He has managed to bring out the transparent sea green of the rolling waves w.ith considerable skill but the waves in. shadow are not so good, and we must pro- ! test against the monotony of his composition. If we analyze one of his pieces we analyze aL. Near us is the rolling sea in light, which we have already mnentioned, with vessels on its surface; further off I the sea becomes dark and opaque, and is lost against the land or the horizon, and above that are the clouds drifting from left to right-the loft, whereI the light is, being a dingy yellow, the right, where the cluds are huddled, being a. dingy blue. Having divided his paper into thee four compartments, he sometimes places the clouds to the left and the light to the right; but, substantially through all his pictures he repeats the same ar- rangeinent until we i only wonder that MIr. Robins does not save hina.eff all further trouble by at oncoe proceeding to lithograph his compoition. Bfr. L. Haghe contributes a view of Venice wiech is clever as usual, but is not pleasing in colour. " Entrance to the Grand Canal, Veice,' by W. Wyld, is less fiery and more pleasant. It is very carefully painted, and the whole effect is quiet and harnonious. A much higher effort by _rUx Haghe is the "Town-hall of Oudenarde-Meeting of the Corporations," where thbe architectural details are given with considerable pDwer, and the jolly burghers are clothed in very billiant dresses, and dispose themselves in highly picturesque attitude3, not usual, we suspect, to corpora.-ens. Of figure subJects there are not many in the g*iaery, and of the fewatill fewer are attractive. One of th beatisa-draw. ing byWelmert, of the scene inDonJ'I-v in -which the stone statue comes to speak with diet Eibcrtine, and where the artist has ample room tsindu?ge-in thosebroad contrasts of light and shade ix whichr he delights. One can scarcely say that the &xpression on thecountenances of Don Juan and Lepcmellblhas been quite successful, but probably this was not the kdnd of success that jr. Wehnert chiefly desiredi In colouringthe effect isrichandharmonious, theredtrnd yellow of Juan's doublet being well balanced bythe purple of the curtain and the green of the table- on the other side of the stony figure. This artist seems fond of the simple contrast of the primary coloursred and green especially; and he is right, howeveiartists in general may object to the simplicity of hiq choice. Nature, after all, knows what is best; ancl when,in summer, she puts forth all the glories of he 2 colours, there isno contrast more common than that of red and green-red flowers and green leaves, and red sldes over green fields. The most ambitious figure subject-indeed, the most ambitious picture -in the room is one by Mr. Edward Corbould, entitled, "Ye Lyminere hys Dreame." The best idea of it will be formed from the description which the artist has thought it necessary to append to the title. " FaUinginto a fitful anduneasy sleep, after a longand protracted reading ofvaried and antagonistic character, he dreams of patrons of art departed to, the Crimea-of himself; as not having a leg left-of falling into the waters of oblivion, and vainly strug- nto ca for the drags of the Hurane Society w s en are gone to Greenwich Fair"-in short of Gorgons and Hydras and Chiseras dire, of dogs hunting birds in the air, and everything turned upside down. The colouring is good but the whole composition is so fantastic, so crowded, and so confused, that for any advantage to the mind, or any delight to the sense, that may be derived from it, one might as well look at the brignt dyes of a Turkey carpet. We- cannot bring this notice to a conclusion without a word or two in reference to the contributions of Weigall and Harrison Weir, which, although the least pretending things in the gallery, are amongthe most interesting fortheir truthfulness. There is not one of the drawings of these artists which will not repay perusal. " The Companions" of Mr. Weigall-the boy, the ass, and the. foal, all sleepily standing by the gate-is excellent. His turkeys are to the life, and few things are better than his rendering of Andersen's tale of the "UIgly Duckling." The poor littlecygnet is set upon by every fowl in the yard, while above it, in a barrel, is the real ugly duck that they would all have shown more taste in pecling to pieces. It is in such simple works as these, where the artist shows a genuine love for the thing he paints, and not a desire to show off his own power, that an unsophisticated observer finds the truest pleasure. As a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, so a cormnon duck that a painter has seen and knows how to draw is worth a legion of angels and flying dragons, saints, prophets, and martyrs, that the painter never saw, never imagined, and with whom he has no real sympathy.

TVELLINGTON ATONUMET.V. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to correct a statement made by Sir B. Hall in ihe House of Commons last evening relative to the above monument. Sir B. Hall informed the House that immediately after he came into the office -which he now holds he asked 3Ir. Bailv and myself to allow himn to see the models which we ha previously submitted to SirW.Iolesvorth, andthat, having seen them, he entirely concurred in the decision at which Sir W. ilolesworth had arrived. Why Sir B. Hall should have made such a statement I cannot comprehend. IJp to the present moment he has never seen my designs. If those designs and the designs submitted by Mr. Baily fell short of what Sir W. 2Iolesworth conceived would be suited to the purpose of a monument to Weflington, I can only ascribe the cause of failure to the smallness of the sum named by him for the execution of the work. It would be impossible to produce a monument vworthy of being erected by a great nation like this to its greatest military hero for a sum of 5,0001. What wvas the costof the tomb of KlapoleoI in the Hotel des Invalides, in Pl'iis ? Even the monument to Lord tRodney, in St. Paul's Cathedral, had upwards of 6,G00L. voted for it. To produce a highly finished work of the proposed size from either of my desi'ns would cave required the expenditure of the wrhole 5,0001. upon it, and nothling short of a desire to have umy name honourablv associated vrith the subject could have induced me to offer so much labour for so little remuneration. Should a second competition take place, I sincerely liope thehistory of it v.ill not add another dar-k page to the many wrhich already blacken the annals of competitions for public monuments. Requesting the insertion of this in the nest impression of Th1e Times, I am Sir. vonr dihp,lipu RP J. IL FOLEY. April 19. ' - -
THE CoNCLUsroI OF PocE.-A numerous party of EnWlLd, and Belgian gentlemen dined together on Thursday, the 1dth inst., at Williams's English Hotel, Bruges, to commemorate the treaty of peace between Russia and the allied Powers, Mir. 2L Mathew in the chair. After the toasts of "the Queen of England," "the King of the Belgians," "the Emperor of the French," "the uing of Sardinia," and " the Sultan," the Chairman, in proposing the toast of the evening, observed, that siX months only had elapsed since they had assembled in that room to celebrate the fall of Sebastopol, and they were now met to testify their approbation of its crowning result -"'the conclusion of Peace." The toast was received with rapturous enthusiasm, after which MIr. Loomans proposed "the Health of the Chairman," who returned thanks. 1L Moarten, in respondino to the toast of " our Belgian guests," remarked that nothing was more grateful to the feelings of his countrymen than the friendly conmexion between them and their English confrrebs, and nothing would give greater satisfaction to the Belgian nation than an union ofthe Comte de Flandres and a Princess of the Royal houso of England. Mr. Van 1Mfulact, in proposing "the British Press," alluded particularly to 27ilZh ines. 3Mr. lay proposed "the Health of Miss Nightingale and the ladies whose generosity and charity had so greatly contributed to the relief of the sicl; and w ounded soldiers who had so gloriously fought our battles in the Crimea." A variety of other toasts connected with the occasion followred. Losr nz A CoiTrr-A most extraordinary accident has been experienced by Mr. Howard Simcox, a highly respectable surveyor in Birmingham. On Monday weekc he left Birningham for Bilston, a few miles distant, for the purpose of collecting the rents of an estate with which he was professionally connected. It was his custom to retumr in the eveinmg; hut on this occasion the night passed away and he did not makehis appearance. His family at length became alarmed, inquiries were instituted, and it was found that he had duly receivedthe rts, was seen going towards the railway station at Bilst4nin the evening, ht beyond that no traces of him could e discovered. oTke first impression was that he had been robbed and perhbas murdered; and more strict inquiries were instituted, but with no results. Meanwhile the unfortunate object of their search was lying in a fearful state of body and mind at the bottom of an old coalpit. It appears that Mr. Simcox, having missed the railway train, beguiled the time until another should start by a walk in the nei-hbourhood of the station. On his return in the dusk of tse evening he took what he considered a short cut across a piece of waste land, when, before he was aware, ho found himself suddenly dropping into the mouth of a coal shaft. Fortunately there was a chain hanging down the pit at the time. At that he clutched, and succeeded in breaking his fall; buthehadnot sufficientstrenth toraise himselfup, and getting exhausted he was compelied to let the chainslin through his hands and go down, he knew not where, nor whether the chain to which he clung might not reach only half wayto the bottom. As the chain tan through his hands they were lacerated in a horrible manner; some of his nails were torn off, his legs were wounded, and his trousers ripped into shreds. Fortnately the chain did reach to the bottom of the shaft, some 30 or 40 yards beneath the surface, where he fell with a heavy shock which sprained his anlde, and for the time rendered himi insensibDe. - On recovering consciousness be endeavoured to make himself heard by shouting and rattling the chain; but the place was lonely and unfrequented, and no aid was. afforded to him. Thus Monday night passed. On Tuesdayr he repeated his cries, but that day passed also; anJ Wednesday also went drearily by in like manner. Ons Thrsay afternoon, although greatly e.xhausted, he en-. tinned his criesa for assistance and kept rattling the c7en Fortunately a boatman on the canal close adjoininh cv. the chain move, and, attracted to tha spot by cisity, shouted dow n the shaft. The trath was at once nFde apparent; a saip Was let down the pit, and Mr. Sirx ia very exhausted state was rescued from his perilo-apositior. For three days and nights he had remained at tl:r, bottom of the shaft without a morsel of food. There wM.s fortunately some water at the bottom, with which he could partially quench his thirst. He never lost hope of rescue, and slept away the nights. When brought to te lsurfaco he drank copiously, and was almeost ravenous w,6th hunger.

FOBEIG.N EYTLLIGaBNE. FRANCE. (ixOX OURL ow.'r CORRES20ONDXNT.) [Aportiof the foUowing appeazed in our aooond edition rf "turrs !-- pARIS, FRIDmY, Al=IL 18a 6 P.Dr. Al. Cavour left Paris last -night, and has, I suppose, before this reached London. Count Buol leaves to-day for Vienna; These two Plenipotentiaries carry very different feelings with them as they separate. The former has cause to be proud of the position his Government occupies before Europe, and he cannot be otherwise than satisfied with the manner in wMhich he himself has performed the arduous duties confided to him. Ie may look back on the past with pleasure, and to the future with hope. Count Buol returns sullenly home, conscious that he has conciliated no one, and stung by the thought that, in the council-room or out of it, his Government was an object of dislike or suspicion to all. The defeat of Novara, and the sort of persecution which the perfidious and the timaid are wont to practise against the bold and honest, and whichAustriahasnot spared to Sardinia, are avenged by her present isolation. She is dislikled and feared by Prussia, hated intensely by Russia, all but defied by Piedmont, probably despised by France, and most assuredly not loved by England; but the enmity of Russia probably causes her more pain than anything else. Hardly an occasion passed that Count )rloff did not show his resentment or insinuate contempt-not the less keen because conveyed in polished terms -for the Government of which Count Buol was the representative at the Congress. This occurred in various ways. It is certaini that whenthe Russian Plenipotentiary asked one day of Count Cavour, in a good-humoured expostulating manner, "What could have induced Sardinia to make war on RusEia ?" Count Cavour replied that Russia had never xecognized the constitutional Government of Piedmont, and spoke and acted as if, in fact, Piedmont had ceased to exist, and that she was obliged to decLare war, if it were only to prove that she was still alive and moving. "3Iy dear Coiunt," said the Russian, " if wre did not recognize you it wvas those Jesuits of Austrians (clinching his hand) who prevented us." At a grand banquet given one day by the President of the Senate to the Plenipotentiaries at the Luxembourg Count Orloff and Count Buol chanced to be standing near each other looking at some beautiful malachite vases, said to have been the gift of the Emperor Alexander to the first Napoleon. The Russian drew the attention of his Austian colleague to some of the pictures with which the roonawas hung, and which represented the battle of Austerlitz, and others in which the Austrians more particularly figured, but not to their glory, during the wars of the Empire. " Look here, Count," said Orloff, "these ought to interest yout more than me." Count Buol looked, and smiled garimly; " iNever mindnever mind," Orloff continued, " I am sure these pictures were not left here expressly to awaken any unpleasant reminiscences in your mind or to vex you. Our hosts are too delicate to pain you. The servants no doubt forgot to remove these pictures, though they knew you were coming ; but don't nind -don't mind." The consolation was the unkindest cut of all. On another occasion, Count 13uol having put forward some extravagant pretensions relative to the Principalities, while he was proceeding with his argument, Count Orloff whispered, not, howvever, sotto voce, but loud enough to be heard, " 3a foi, pas mal, M. le Comte; pas si mal. On dirait que c'est les Autrichiens qui ont pris Sebastopol." These cutting sarcasms, together with the downright opposition of the other Plenipotentiaries, must have made Count Buol's situation a very unpleasant one, and it must be a relief to himself personally that the Congress is at last at an end. Whilst anecdotes are in the way-, Imust not omit one which relates to Lord Clarendon. The Emperor, it appears, was very anxious to give his LTrdship the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour an honour which M. de 3fanteuffel has already zeceived. Lord Clarendon (so the story runs) explained to His Majesty that no British Minister or British subject can accept a foreign decoration unless for military services; "1 and such beina the fact," he added, " my case has not an inch of ground to stand on, as my services in Paris have been especially pacific." Austria feels keenly her moral isolation, for isolated she is; and I should not be surprised if some triiling concessions -were made in her Italian states, in the hope of conciliating the population, and exciting some little feeling in her favour. But it is admitted on all hands that she has cut a very poor figure indeed at the Congress. When those who were wont to reprobate Prussia now place Austria below her, you may judge of the discredit she has fallen into. I omnitted to mention yesterday that before separating at the last meeting the Plenipotentiaries passed unanimously a vote of thanks to Count Valewski for his conduct as President of the Congress. We read in the Moniteur de la Flofte * The proceedings taken against General Kokonovich, who conmanded the fortress of Kinburn when it was cap. tured, on the 17th October last, by the naval forces of England and France, have been brousht to a close. The examinatioi of the General's conduct was referred to a Council of Inquiry, which sat at Odessa on the 3d inst. TheCouncil, after a thorough investigation of all the facts connected with the attack and defence of the place, and of the text of the capitulation, declared that the General's conduct in such circumstances deserved no blame, and that there was no occasion to summon a Court-martial to inquire into it. The members of the Council all admitted that the besiegers, by effecting the investment of the fortress both by sea and land, and bringing to bear against it a formidable naval artillery, and war engines of anew description, called floatng batteries, left the besieged no chance of repelling the enemy and compelled him to capitulate; that, moreover, the General had continued the defence as long as it was possible, and that he only surrendered when his garrison vas decimated, all his guns dismounted, and the enemy's bombs had set on fire the buildings adjoining the great powder magazine. The Council paid particular attention to the flattering testimony borne in favour of the General by Admiral Brunat, who in his despatch declared that the defence made by General Kokonovich had been honourable and ably directed." A letter from Jerusalem gives news of the Easter caravan dow-n to the 29tn ult. After having been delayed for four days by bad weather, the pilgrims had landed at Jaffa on the 13th. They were joined at Jerusalem byan Austrian caravan composed of 14 persons. About 200 Europeans were assembledat the ceremonies of the Passion Week. Betweenthe 25th and the 28th they went to Jericho, to the Jordan, the Dead Sea, St. Saba, Bethlehem, and St. John of the Desert. On the 31st they were to set out for Nazareth, MIount Cannel, and Beyrout. All the party were in good health. The French expedition to Madagascar is preparing at Brest. It will not, however, be on the large scale that was intended; 20,000 men were at first spoken of, but the moment is not yet come when such a number can be spared, and, moreover, they may be wanting for some more pressing purpose. All that wvill now be done is to despatch a single regiment to occupy the western point of the island, and protect the French subjects and any establishments that may be formed there from the attacks of the natives. The expedition takes place with the approval of the English Government. TLe expedition to Kabylia will not take place before October, the season when forage for horses is most abundant. It has been stated in an English paper that the :mperor declined to receive M. Tricoupi, the Greek 31iinist tr at London, who was charged to present a letter of felicitation on the birth of the Imperial Prince from King Otho. This, I am assured, is not the case, at least in the sense conveyed. None of the foreign linisters having such letters to present kave heen received by the Emperor. The letters in question are delivered to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and by him placed before the Emperor. The whole of the Diplomatic Corps offered in person their cong=ratulations on the birth of the Prince on the 17th of March. T1he receipts of the Orleans Railway dluring the weelk ended on the 7th inst. were 942,288f., or 11,537f. more than during the corresponding: w-eek of 1855.

SATURDAY, APRiL 19,6 P.M. Their Mlajesties will take up their residence at St. Cloud towards the end of the present month. The Emperor and M. Fould yesterday visited the buildings in the new Iouvre which are destined to receive the Mlinistry of State and that of the Interior. The offlces of the former will occupy all the part fronting the west as well as that of the south as far as the Pavillon do Rohan. The offices of the Ministry of the Interior will be comprised in the buildings which extend from the Louvre along the Place NRapoleon and join the Payillon de Rohari. The Mfinistry of State will be removed to its now offices in September next, but the Ministry of the Interior cannot be installed until June next yenr. The Senate has just lost one of its members in the person of the Count de Barral, who died in Paris a fen- days ago, aged 68. He held the post of page to the E:mperor Napoleon I., and was present with the Emperor at the battle of Austerlits. The followingprivate telegraphic despatches have been received: "YxVI-A, April 18.-One-half of the Austrian army of occupation in the Danubian Principalities ix about to return into Austria; an order to that effect has already been forwarded to General Coronini." " Vn3s- , April 1S, Eveninrg.-The Austrian Conrespondence announces that the Emperor signed the ratification of the Treaty of Peace on the 15th, and that in consequence thanksgivings had been ordered throughout the whole of the monarchy. The Amico Catolieo announces, non-offi. cially, that M. de Kisseleff will proceed to Rome to conclude a concordat between the Pope and Russia." " BER}Mn, April 18.-Mh Stieglitz set off yesterday for Paris, to arrange the project of a bank at St. Petersburg. The intention of founding a bank of credit at Warsaw has been abandoned. The Prussian cavalry has been reduced to the peace establishment; the artillery vil be also reduced newt week." "STociromr, April 16.-The Afton&ladet announces that the Queen Dowager of Sweden will set out for Paris about the 10th of May. Prince Oscar, third son of the King of Sweden, will afterwards proceed to Tondon, preparatory to his marriage with the Princess of Cambridge." A private letter from Madrid speaks of a desire existing on the part of the Government for making an expedition against Nicaragua, combined with France and EngLand, under the apprehension that if the Americans succeed there the same Filibusters may pass on next to Cuba. There are persons, however, who are of opinion that Spain had better keep her fag out of any collision with the " stripes and stars," for that the IJnited States would, in all likelihood, make "a mighty pretty quarrel" out of anything of the sort, and that neither England nor France might think it expedient to extricate Spain from her cmbarrassmenit. A feeling seemed to be getting up with the lower classes against the Credit Mobilier, which is regarded by them as a net, commercial and political, by which France may envelope the country.

The Austrian Plenipotentiary to the Congress *as to leave Paris on Thursday, the 17th, but he can hardly reach Vienna before Tuesday, the 22d, as he intends to pass eight-and-forty hours at Brussels, in order to have an opportunity of paying his respects to the Duchess of Brabant, who is a Princess of the House of Austria. The Austrian ratification is not yet prepared, and two or three days are likelyto elapsebefore it canbe expedited,as sixorsevencopies of thevarious documents haveto bewritten on parchment.. Seven Powers were represented at the Paris conferences, but only six copies will be made of some of the documents, as Prussia had nothing whatever to do with one or two of them. Little is said here of the present relations between Russia and Austria, but still it is known that the former loses no opportunity of giving des coups d'pingle to her former friend and ally. The representatives of Russia and Turkey at the Austrian Court have not yet exchanged cards, and it is very possible that some time will elapse before a reconciliation takes place, as M. de Balabine, the Russian Charge d'Aifaires ad interi, is a high and rmighty personage, who wouid hardly condescend to return the visit of his Turkish colleague, Isham Bey. As you were informed on Saturday last, the Austrian prelates had an audience of the Emperor on that day, and we now learn that Prince Schwarzenberg, the Cardinal Archbishop of Prague, addressed His Majesty, in Latin, to the following effect. His Grace opened his speech by congratulating his Sovereign on having restored peace and quiet to the empire, but he declared that His Majesty had accomplished a stil greater work wvhen he. restored to the church. its rights and privileges. The Cardinal avered that everything which the Church might demand "towards the furtherance of its high calling" would be a benefit to the human - race. The concordat of fte 18th. August, 1855, was spoken of in enthusiastic terms, and the Caidinal rejoiced *that I *uch a complete connexibn had' beea established between the Papal Chair and the Roman Catholic Church in Austria. The Archbishop said:- "W Without let or hindrance the Bishops can guide the communities intrusted to their care, and edify them by their doctrines and exhortations ; they can direct the education of the Catholic youth of the empire in every. thing which concerns matters of faith and of pure norality, and they can so bring up the candidates for the priesthood that they shall be worthy servauts of God and of the Church. Ecclesiastical judges will decide on ques~ tions of law which concern the Church. Throughout the empire matrimonial matters are under the jurisdiction of the Clhrch. TDe religious orders enjoyperfect liberty. The property of the Church is inviolable, and is to be managed agreeably to the canons." After having enumerated the privileges which the Monarch had bestowed on the clergy, the speaker expressed his conviction that the union of Church and State is tho most mighty protection for all that is held good by man. " It is only in a Christian state," said the Cardinal, " that Europe, greatly disturbed, can find united the hope of future salvation and the benefits of peace on earth." Inthe closing paragraph of his speechthe Cardinal expressed to His Majesty the gratitude of the Austrian Synod and of all those persons "w who would enjoy the blessings winch could not but proceed from the concordat." The Emperor made the following reply in the Latin language to the address:- "By the convention with the Holy See, I have discharged my duty as M1onarch and Christian. I consider it an honour to be able to prove by my deeds that my faith and hope are placed on Him through whom Kings reigns and I well know what pow erful influence strong religionu, conviction has on society at large. What I have promis4d I will perfonn with that good faith vhich beseems the man and the Emperor, but such a task can only be perfected by a union of strength. It is for you, therefore, most reverend bishops, to co-operate with me and each other, in order thst faith and moral strength my Lthrive aong us. Trust in me, as I trut in you. Godill be with us.'! After the audience the 67 prelates waited on the Cardinal Viale Prela, the Papal Nuncio,in order to thank him for the great trouble he had taken in settling the conditions of the concordat. It has excited sone surprise here that the members of the French Legation should speak in such veryhigh tenns of the Austrian concordat, but it is known to the few that they have received instructions from head-quarters so to do. Foreign. and m6re particullarly English, finns have recently bought Lombardo-Venetian Railroad shares to a very large amount, and one of the Nestors of the Austrian finance world,, who is no longer in business, assures me that they have displayed great judgment in doing so. The reply given to my question, why the prenium on the Lombardo-Venetian Railroad shares should be so high, was-" 53 German iiles (about 250 Finglish) of the railroad are completed, and the company pays for them to the State about one-half of the original cest." The LTombardo-Venetian and the Central Italian Railroads belong to the same great company, but they are to all intents and purposes separate affairs. The company will issue shares for the Lombardo-Venetian, but not for the Central Italian line. The company completes the latter, Govern.ment having undertaken to pay 6i per cent. interest on the outlay. So-called priority bonds (" prioritlts obligationen"') twill be issued by the proprietors of the Central Italian Railroad. The concession for the Theiss Railroad will be granted in a few' days, and the country through which it is to pass is so level that it may be finished in less than three years. Some 18 German miles (85 English miles) wrill probably be open to the public within; the year, as Go-. vernment has done almost eveiything but; put dowsn the rails. The dividend of the Northern Railroad for the last year was 15 per cent.i and a very considerable sum was added[ to the reserve fund. To judge from the receipts during January, February, and March, the dividend for 1856 will be still larger, and the consequence is, that the shares have risen to 308 and 309. ESxperiments are being made in the Danube with a new gunboat and a " gun-raft." The gunboat, which is 36 feet long and 18 broad, has six: 3-pounders and one 18-pounder on board. The " gun-raft," which is composed of 14 pieces or parts, which can in case of need be used for forming a bridge, is also armed with one 18-pounder. Neither craft draws more than 13 inches of water. In six days the Austrian Lloyd Company will open a direct communication between Trieste and Constantinople. It is not yet known in how many days thepassage can bemade, but the Trieste people seem to think that they wvill be able to beat the Marseilles boats. The company has just bought an American steamer of 1,500 tons, and two fast steamers have been ordered in England. PRUSSIA. l (FROM OUR OWN COoRRESPONDENr.) BERIIN, APRIL 17. As the telegraph has informed us that the last sitting of the Paris conferences was held yesterday, and that Baron von Manteuffel left Paris to-day, it is confidently expected that the Minister-President will arrive here on Saturday, or Sunday at the latest. As I mentioned in a former letter, he will take the route of Frankfort, for the purpose of conferring there with Herr von Bismarck Schonhausen on the subject of a communication very shortly to be made to the Diet in connexion with the late negrotiations. As may be supposed, the authentic news that reaches us from the Paris conferences is scanty enough. One'of the many statements on this topic, how ever, which is not quite incorrect is, that Prussia will have to send a vessel of war, the same as the other contracting Powers, to act as guardship at the mouth of the Danube. The only incorrectness in this is, that Prussia is not bound, but only entitled to do so. This was settled in the 5th article of the elaboration of the third point at the Vienna Conferences of last year " Each of the contracting Powers that have no marine establishments in the Black Sea shall, on giving five days' notice, be empowered by a firman of the Sultan to introduce into that sea a number of vessels equal to the half of that number which the two littoral Powers have a right to maintain there." It is not at all likely that Prussia, with her infantineflotilla and scanty financial resources, will be very anxious to avail herself of this permission for any lengthened period, but it is very possible that when one of the five vessels of the Prussian fleet has been got ready at Dantsic she wiU be sent into the Black Sea to exhibit her pennant there with the others, and will then set off on a trip of scientific research in the Greek islands of the Mediterranean. The Kling has had this plan in cogitation for some time past.! On Tuesday last the Minister of War mentioned in the House of Deputies that the King had given orders the day before that all the arrangements with respect to the Ks-iegsbereitckft of the army should be suspended.I The St;ats Axzzqer announces that the Govern- ! ment has receied official notice from the British Embassy that, in consequence of the cessation of hostilities agreed upon between Great Britain and her allies on the one side and Russia on the other, and in expectation of the ratification of the treaty of peace, the necessary orders have been given with reference to the raising of the blockade of the Russian harbours without delay. The 21 cases of firearms which were lately seized here on their way from 3elgium to Russia, mn contravention of the Prassian prohibition of transit for arms and ammunition, have been delivered upto the owners, now that t,he prohibition itself hasbeen repealed. Letters from East Prussia mention that numbers of fine carriage horses continue to pass through there on their way to Russia. They are said to be intended, like so many others which I have had occasion to mention before, to figure in the coming coronation procession at Moscow. rBcaron Stieglitz, the St. Petersburg banker, is now here, and is said to be in close negotiation with various banking-houses with reference to different speculations in Ruissia and Poland. A main promoter of these plans here is Herr von Magnus, a leading banker of Berlin, and brother-in-law of Baron von Brunow. The project that is most spoken of is a Credit Mobilier in Warsaw, and a member of one of the banking-houses here has already left for the Polish capital in consequence of the scheme. Colonel von Manteuffel has arrived here from Dusseldorf, to take the place of Major-General von Sch6ler in the management of the perslzalia in the Ministry of War. It appears that Major-General von Scholer really is ill, aid is obliged to have recourse to a medicinal spring; thisillness, however, has been entirelybrought onbytheworry and anxiety: entailed upon him by the King's late appointment of General-Bonin to the command of the fortress of Mayence. Although so closely attached to the person of the King, and intrusted with the direction of a branch of the military admiiistration apart from the Ministry of War, MIajor General von Scholer belongs as little as General Bonin to the Caamarilla or to the reactionary party, the heads of whichi for the most part compose it. The King's private secretary, Niebahr, continues to be incapacitated from resuming his post by illness, brought on by the .vexations and annoyances attendant on the theft and publication of parts of his private correspondence of last summer; he continues to trayel about in search of health and equanimity; the reports afloat here of his being about to be appointed' Minister of Finance are about as well founded and as clever as those which select for his successor as the King's private secretary the Precureur du Rol in crSminal cases, Korner. The Central Office of the Zollverein has published the provisional accounts of receipts and expenditure of the Zollverein in 1855. The import duties produced 25,493,510 thalers; export ditto in the eastern division, 105,062; transit ditto of the same -division, 563,013; export dutes of the western division, 109,000; and transit dues, 54,264. Total, 26,324,849 thalers. The costs of custom-house establishments and collection were 2,676,242 thalers. After making some other deductions there remained as net receipts to be divided 23,411,728 thalers. On Tuesday afternoon the funeral of the Steward of the Turkish Embassy took place here according to the rites of the Mahomedan religion. The coffin, which was of a green coloiur, was lowered into the grave without any religious ceremony; four l6ng boards were then placed so that they rested at the one end on the bottom and with the other reached to the opposite side of the top of the grave, and the earth was then shovelled in. The burial-place is one that was allotted to the followers of the Turkish Embasy in the early part of this century, and lies outside of the town, away from any consecratel ground. - (iaok OUR RUSSIA. (FROM OU BE COOB. * ! BERIZN, AvIuL 16. The annual commercial report of the port of St. Petersburg for the past year Will perhaps still have some interestfor yourreaders, although, apparently,' the attention of the trading publie is already-in preference turned to the eommercial futue'rather than to the pait commercial history of-Russia. It is dated January 1 (N. s., 13th) of this year, and mentions, in the firt instance, that the winter had set in with unusual severity, and that the' Teva had been- frozen over ever since :Novembr 13.- Befora the winter -haA entirely set in' a considerable- number of vess'els had succeeded in leaving Cronstadt and conveying provisions to -Finland; this w-as, however, the whole extento'f the shipping move-' ment in the port of"' St. Petersburg during 1855. Carriage by landu-was the only means of vent for Russian producej or-of deriving supplies of goods from abroad; land con7veya'nee became in the past year very much easier and1-more punctual than in the preceding. Land firight,'which was very moderate at the beginning of the -past year, rose gradually, and reachedits highest-point in September, after which time it fell, in conSequence of the sledge traffic being facilitated by the fall of snow. tItappears that with all the facilities here vaunted the conveyance of goods from St. :Petersburg to Memel took at least 40 days-to K6nigsberg-45 days.) The compilers of the report state it to be impossible to give any statement of the amohnt of goods exported from St. Petersburg during the past year; from their own statements, however, it appears that almost all articles of export whicn formerly were remitted to St. Petersburg for shipment were in this last year sent direct to Kovno, to be forwarded thence to some Prussian port. At the 'date of the report (January 1) there- was nothing to be said with any certainty about tallow; certain parcels lad been purchased for delivery near the frontier at an early period; but, as regards delivery at St. Petersburg; August was the earliest date spoken of for which sales had been made. The various statements of the report show the traffic in almost every article to have been reduced to the lowest amount by one cause or another. The prices and stocks -in hand at the turn of the year all evidence the greatest possible depression. In hemp " nothing of any consequence has been done for a long time , present stock300,000 pouds; coming supplies estimated to be very scanty; and, in the absence of any contracts, no prices can be quoted." In potash, "very quiet; large purchases impossible, as only about 500 barrels on hand in St. Petersburg and neighbourhood." In wood ashes, " no stocks on hand in St. Petersburg and neighbouring towns, and no fresh supplies expected before May." Copperprices firm, but stock on hand very smalL. Morocco leather-trade at a standstill for want of goods (the tanners seem to have directed their attention exclusively to white skins for the use of the army). Hides are entirely wanting ; isinglass there is none, and no fresh supply is expected before the end of January. In grain everything very quiet. The stock of rye was 162,000 chetwerts; wheat, 225,000; rye flour, 325,000 kuhl; and of wheat flour 90,000 sacks. The stock of hinseed was 195,000 chetwerts, but very little of it was free from smell. Trade in imported goods had been very inconsiderable, seeing that almost everything that had been imported at the land frontier had gone direct to theo interior. The last year's produce of 'beetroot sugar had been very small. The spinners of yarn had had a very hard time of it, as they had had very low prices to contend with. A further report, dated February 14 (ii. s., 26th), is intoned in quite another key; the expectations of peace have imparted a fresh aspect to trade. Russian produce has risen, and imported articles, more particularly the so-called war articles, have sunk materially. Talow for delivery in August has risen to 142k roubles; potash' to 20 roubles; clean hemp, for delivery in July, 231 roubles; fLax, first quality, 30 r. s.; and linseed, 7 r. s. It was hoped, in the interest of Russia, that the prohibition of the export of cereals would be repealed as soon as peace was concluded, for there vas not the most distant apprehension of any dearth in the north or in the south. Imported articles have sunk in price; war articles were ahnost unsaleable; lead fell from 54 r. s. to 35 r. s., sulphur fronm 4 to 2 roubles per pond. It is added, at the close of this supplementary report, that changes nad taken place in foreign quotations and rates of exchange to the extent of 6 per cent. in favour of Russia since the close of last year. Dull and uninteresting as commercial statistics necessarily are for the bulk of your readers, I will persevere with the subject on the present occasion, in the belief that the information will be of value both to the politician and the merchant. The annual commercial report of the port of Riga tells pretty much the same story as the previous report from St. Petersburg had done. The severe weather which set in immediately after the blockade of 1854had been raised had prevented the vessels bound for Riga, and at that time on their w;ay thither, from reaching that port; the early arrival of the block- ading squadron in 1855 had been equally fatal to - the resumption of over-sea trade at the com- mencement of 1855. The export of goods by' land from Riga was less last year than in i the preceding, not from any less demand from abroad, but from deficient supplies; the articles fronm the interior of Russia were not forwarded to Riga for exportation, but 'were sent by way of Kovno, and even Warsaw, across the land frontier. The supplies from the interior would have been still less than they were if it had not been for the Vienna Conferences inducing many persons to send their goods to Riga, in the expectation of the navigation being speedily reopened in the spring of 1855, or on the conclusion of a peace there. The supply of flax to the Riga miirkets in 1855 was 130,000 berkovitz, of which 105,000 were exported. Prices were pretty much the same as in the previous year; they rose rapidly-from the end of MIarch lup to the middle of June, and sunk then, until in September the reduced price of land transport came to the assistance of trade. The stock ofi hemp at the commencement of the year was 8,200berkovitz the supplies during the year, 89,000. The export, hlowever, only reached 75,000, or 43,000 berkovitz less than in the preceding year. The 'trade in linseed opened with a stock of -100,000 casks, -with little expectation of clearing it, as part' of it was known to be not quite 'sound. Neverthe-' less, the whole quantity, together with further sup-plies to the extent of 71,000 casks, was disposed- of. Riga exported in 1854 only 10,000 casks; in last! -year, 158,500. Contracts at the price of 4 roubles, made last August for delivery next May, have since then'met with an advance of 15, 20, and 50 peri cent. The quantity contracted for at the date of the report was 120,000 casks. The crop of linseed has been ample in quantity and excellent in: quality. The- supplies of tallow amountedi during the year to 9,670 berkovitz, being 4,000 -more than in the preceding year; this quan- l tity, together wvith the stock remaininsg over from-last year-about 1,000 berkovitz-was all cleared oifi by the end of the year. Trade was very flat in this article up to July, and the price as low as 331 roubles; since then the demand has been brisk, and' the price has risen to 52 roubles. All the stocks of grain were disposed of at the end of the year; it was in great demand for the various bodies of troops in Riga and the neig,hbourhood; only very small quantities were exported in the course of the year, but the Government thought it necessary, for the purpose of preventing a scarcity arising, on October 18, to prohibit its further exportation.- Salt was imported to the extent of 200,000 pouds at the sea frontiers and of 700,000 pouds by the land frontiers. The total value of the exports is estimated at six millions of silver roubles, against seven millions in 1854; the imports cannot be ascertained. The total number of ships that arrived at Riga in 18M4 was 11; of which 5 were Dani,h and 3 Swedish. There was no Russian arrival at all. 16 Russian vessels that lay there all the winter of 1854-5 continued to lie there all last year. Of the 11 ships that -entered the port 8 were laden with salt, 1 with salt and wine, 1 with earthenware, and 1 with coals. It will be little more than a continuation of the same subject of Russian exports and imports if I add to the above the annual report of the movement of trade in the Prussian port of Ilemel; for what trade it formerly possessed of its own seems to have been entirely thrust into the background by the demand for Russian produce, and the whole energies of the tradizig community to have been directed to the forwarding of it. The amount of goods thus forwarded has been larger in- 1855 than in 1854; the eense of transport-as great ax before, but the costsof warehouse room,'of libour, Ac., much increased, in consequenceof the great fire, which consumed the greater part of the town in October of the preceding year.i The ~number of - ships that have put into Meinel in 18S5 was 1,820, with an aggre| gate burdenl of 235,900 lats against 1,809 vessels in 1854, witha burdenof 2l9,2!00.13sts.- Of the", 1,820 v essels 502 were Prussian anxd47 Enllgih; thereat were of various nations. In timnber, which is a min article of Memeltrade, hardly anything was done until August; this was Eowng, firit; to the expectations of peace from the Vienna Conferences, and then to the high ralue of moniey abroad, which damnped speculation. Tne first supplies: did not commence ariving until august; they, as well as the stocks on hand, have been bought us, but many floats of timber have been lost - by rough weather, after having succeeded in reaching the Mlemel 3Iaff, and still many more have been surpised by the vwinter and frozen upin the Niemen and MIemel. In grain very little was done, considering that for the greater portion of the year the neighbouring Russian. province, Courland, sent its produce to lfemel for sale; with the exception of a few parcels of wheat that came by water carriage, all that was exported came from Russia by land carriage. Prussia herself supplied no grain for exportation. Holland was the chief Durchaser; very littlewentto England. Export trade in grain was cut short by the high prices offered for it for home consumption; and subsequently, upon the Russian prohibition of export, great fears were entertained at one time of a dearth arising. To obviate this Danish and Swedish grain has been imported freely into Memel, and the inhabitants there looked at the beginning of this year to Lilbeck for further supplies of the same. Linseed has been in good demand the whole year; 8,011 lasts hxave been exported, of which 7,690 arrived this year from Russia. Prices rose steadily during the year, until in November they reached their culminating point at 105 to 120 silber groschen pqr scheffel. They had, however, fallen fully 1Q per cent. beforethe endof the year. About 3,000,000 stone weight of flax were exported, with prices steadily rising until autumn came, when it; became evident that the quantity exported exceeded the demand abroad. Of hemp about 1,100,000 stone were exported. The amount of salt imported for transit through to Russia in 1855 was 380,000 cwt. more than inthe preceding year. The return of peace will now give the mer chants of Memel ample time to make up their books and regulate their affairs for a much diminished amount of through trade, and in this year's commercial account we may confidently expect to find it stated that, after deducting aul the bad debts they have contracted with Russian merchants and Jew carriers, and all the exorbitant expenses they have been at for tranport, rent, warehouse room, and labour, there has been very little profit left to t<hem out of this two years' spirt of transit business in Russian produce. The ConstittionneZ publishes a long letter from Moscow, dated the 11th of ApriL We extract the following - " The Emperor has arrived quite unexpectedly at our eity, accompanied by the Grand Dukes Constantine, Meichael, and Nicholas, and a numerous Staff. Their reception was most enthusiastic. This morning the Emperor gave audience to Count Zakrewsld, the military governor. Deputations from the nobles and from the civil and military authorities accompanied him. Vhen all these persons had formed a circle round him the Emperor addressed them as follows:- "' Gentlemnen,-The war is over; for I ratified the treaty of peace which had been signed at Paris before I left St. Petersburg. Iamhappy to be able to announce the news to you officiaUy, and to repeat to the nobility of Moscow the words which I addressed to my people in my last manifesto. Russia was able to defend herself for many years to come, and I believe that, no matter what forces were brought agaiunst her, she was invulnerable on her own territory. But I felt that it was my duty, in the real interests of the country, to lend an ear to proposals compatible with the national honour. War is an abnormal state, and the greatest successes obtained by it scarcely compensate for the evils it occasions. It had caused an interruption of the commercial relations of the empire with most of the States of Europe. I should certainly have carried it on had not the voice of neighbouring States pronounced itself ag-ainst the policy of late years. My father, of imperishable memory, had his reasons for acting as he did. Ilmnew his views, and I adhere to them from my very soul; but-the treaty of Paris has obtained the object which it was his ambition to obtain, and I prefer this means to war. *" ' Many of you, I am aware, regret that I should have so readily accepted the propositions made to me. It was my duty as a man and as the head of a great empire, either to reject or accept them frankly; I have honourably and conscientiously fulfilled that duty; I am sure that allowances wil be made for the difficult position in 'whichI was placed, and that shortly every devoted friend of Russiawill render justice to my views and intentions for the welfare of the country. " Supposing the fate of arms should have remained constantly favourable to us, as it has been in Asia, the Empire would have exhausted its resources in keeping up large armies on different points, the soldiers of 'which would in a great measure be takenuaway from agriculture and labour. In the government of Mloscow itself many manufactories have been compelled to close. Iprefer the real prosperity of the arts of peace to the vain glory of combats. " ' Ihave thrown open the ports of Russia to the commerce of the world, the frontiers to the free circulation of foreign produce. I wish, henceforth, that the greatest facility shall be afforded in our markets for the exchange of ware of every origin, and of the raw materials and manufactures of our soils. Various projects 'wll shortly be communicated to you, the object of 'vhich will be to give an irm pulse to home industry, and in which, I trust, every noble. man will take a share.' "The Emperor, who spoke at considerable lenth, and with some emotion,was listened to in religious silence. Ilis Majesty onmitted nothing,-neither the plans for projected railways, nor fortheriver navigation, norfor the roads, nor for Custom-house reforms. TheMinistersof the Interior and of Finance have received formal orders from His Majesty to do away 'rith al obstruetions in the way of contmerce. The frontier traffic is already open, and vessels are arriving at all our ports. The export of precious metals is alone stil suspended, and this is explained by the scarcity of gold and silver in the public treasiury. ' The Emperorvwas everywhere received with the most profound respect. A grand review was held at Moscow. His Majesty visited various manufactories, and gave order3 respecting his coronation, which will probably take place on the 30th of Augut next, the fltc day of St. Alexander."
EXHI}BITION OF PRIzE D)AwwGs.-DTlring the -past week thero has been on view at the Bristol Fine Art, .Academy. a, collection embrrcing the prize works of tle students in the varions Schools of Art now establisbedin the great towns tlroughont the-kingdom -orthepurposeof affording artisans and others the means of perfecting themselves in the artistic departments of their trades by the, study of drawing, colour, form, combination of figures, &c. The works. exhibifeaa-re classed under certain specified stages of instruction, comprising the more ad7vanced and technical studies, the stages represented being drawing-the human figure or animal forms from the round or nature,: wihere the pupil draws from the finest antique statues; anatomical studies, where the bones, &c., ,are drawn from the articulated form strang up into various positions; painting direct from nature; painting groups of natural objects, as compositions of colour, &c., painting figure in mnonochrone from casts; elementary design, the main intention of which stage is to give a stimulus 'to the inventive faculties of the student; ornamental arrangements 'to f111 a given space in monochrone and in colour. In this section a natural object is furnished as a type, to be ornamentaUly displayed and arranged to fil a given form agreeably to quantity and contrast, and in accordance with the laws of colour. The object selected this year has been the nightshade, which has been admirably and ingeniously worked up to fil a hexagon, each sehool being required to blend its studies in sets of four. Besides the stages before noticed there are others-such as studies of historical style, ornament, technical studies and applied designs wherein the student makeshisfirstessay to applyhisknowledge topraticaluse. Then, there are studies from special classes in the central Iormal Training School, such as in lithography, in engraving, and in painting on porcelain. In the la$-named staga th&revwere some beautiful specimens, including Murillo's "'Spanish Beggar Boy," Reynolds's "Infant Samuel," ard Cuyp's "Dutch Boatsin a Storm." On the wholethe e fbition has been a gratifying one, anda single glance round the roomn would have been sufficient to show how such studies must improve the. taste and artistic talent of all our handicraftsmen who are engaged in any work into which figure and ornament are introduced. The exhibition was visited by nearlv 3,300 persons during the past week.

The 34th section of the act was express upon the point. UWKEXR V. HMALEWMLL Mr. George Hawker in 1835, when he was heir apparent of a tenant in tail in remainder, after a life estate in certain real estates, gave a bond to Mr. George Edwards for 1, OOt. and interest, the condition of which bond cwas that it should cease and be void on the happening of certain very special contingent events, some of which mlght never hapen. Mr. George Hawker in 1842, beinginprisonfor debt at Glocester, filed his petition under the Act for Relief of Insolvent Debtors, and was discharged in July, the money due to George Edwards being inserted inhis schedule. In 1843 the tenant in tail died, and in the year 1853 the tenant for li.-e also died. Soon afterwards MIr. George Hawker conveyed and assigned all the residue of his real and personal estate to trustees for the benefit of his creditors. A suit was instituted for the admiistration of this trust, and in it Mr. George Edwards went in to prove the 1,000g. and interest, and the chief clerk alowed ithe same. The Vice-Chancellor Stuart, upon an appeal to hiin, refased to disturb the certificate, the case, in his opimon, coming within the 75th aud SCth sections of the statute 1 and 2 Victoria, chap. 110. The appellant then (and now from his Honour's decision) was Mr. George Hawker, who contended that the chief clerk ought only to have allowed the amount of the valuation of the whole debt, and not upon the debt itself. Mr. Malins and Mr. Roxburgh appeared in support of the appeal; Mr. Freeling appeared for the trustees. Iffr. A3HLETT, for Mr. Edwards, did not think that his client had gone in under the insolvency and that he was entitled ass cr_ditor to the benefit of the deed. Their LonDsurrs were of opinion that there was no suestion that when the deed was executed there was a ebt, and that therefore the certificate was perfectly correct, and the appeal wholly indefensible, and mnust be dismissed with costs. Mr. Cairns, Mr. DicLinson, M3. Greene, and Mr. Hobhouse appeared for the other parties. Lord Justice ILIcrnr Bnucz expressed his extreme surprise and regret that such an appeal should have been presented. A man had only to give a post-OU security upon hard terms and then to get a friend to arrest him, and then to take the benefit of the Insolvent Debtors Act and defeat his creditors. Such would be the effect if tho argument presented to the Court could prevaiL Such might be the view tal-en of the law of a civilized country, but the Court was of a different opinion.

This was a speclal case for the opinion of the Court, which raised the question whetherthe local board of health at Ely were empowered, as they had done, to rmake highway-rates for the repair of the highways in the several parishes; or whether they were bound. as the appellant contended, to mal;e a general dishict rate for the same purpose. In the latter case, the appellant would be assessed at only one-fourth of the amnuil value of the land occupied by him. MIr.

JSSOP. nEVgs n lnanco, Keaste SWen, elore anora (hiLf Jutice JERBv S and.Justices C.RMSWMILO CROWDF X, and 1Y1JLT5) This was an action tried before the Lord Chief Justice, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff, damages 106g. A rule having been obtained to set aside that verdict for misdirection, and also to reduce the damages, Mr. Boville and 3Mr. C. Follock showed cause against the rule, and Mr. Day and Mr. Leake appeared in support of it. the action was brought by the plaintiff egainst the defendant for not delivering certain shaTes in the Wheal Gustus Mine, purchased by the plaintiff, to which the defendant set up the objection, that the shares in question were an interest in land, and that the agreement of sale was within the operation of the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds, and, not being in writing signed by the defendant, he could not be sued upon it. For the pLaintiff, it was contended that the facts showled lhat no interest passed in the land itself, but that only a right to a share in the profits of the mine passed. The nnixe was worked on the costbook principle. The case of " Watson v. Spratley," in the 1Oth volnume of the Ezchequcr RcporLm, was relied upon as deciding that such shares were not an interest in land. For the defendant, it was attempted to distinguish the case from "W Watson v. Spratley," and it was contended that the shares sold were those belonging to a Mr. Stainsby, who was the assigee of the realty of which they formed a part, that the real estate was in him and in the owners of those parts of it of which he disposed. The COURT said, they were bound by the decision in "Watson v. Spratley," but that the parties might appeal, and, without expressing any opinion on the case, wished to be understood as deciding on the authority of that case only. Rule refused. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at Westminster, before Mr. Justiee WILLLIS and a Common Jury.) VARNER V. WIDDECOMEE. The jury having retired, as mentioned in our notice of this case in nie inzes of Saturday, in the course of Friday evening eturned a sp?ecial verdict, which was ultimately entered for the plaintiff for 8652., leave being reserved to the defendant to move on points of law raised during the trial. BRADFORD V. BAL1ARD. Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Prentice were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Barrow for the defendant. In this action the plaintiff sought to recover damages for the alleged conversion by the defendant of a chest of plate under the following circumstances - In the year 1849 Mr. Bradford being anxious to raise a sum of money upon certain furniture, Lc., in houses belonging to him at Sandgate, near Folkestone, applied to a person named Benzie to lend him 300l. Mr. Benzie accordingly went dovn to Sandgate to examine the security ofiered; he there made an inventory of the goods including linen and plate, lent the money and subsequently took a mortgage by deed upon the " furniture, hinen, and plate, in houses belonging to MIr. Bradford at Sandgate and elsewhere." The plaintiff had, however, other plate besides that at Sandgate, and this he had deposited with the defendant for safe keeping. Subsequently the defendant gave it up to Mfr. Besie, and for this conversion the present action was brought. It was contended for the defence-first, that all the plate belonging to the plaintiff, wsether at Sandgate or elsewhere, passed under the deed of mortgage ; and, secondly, that the plaintiff had authorized Mr. Benzie to obtain from the defendant the chest of plate which had been intrusted to him. The evidence adduced on each side was most carefuly summed up by the learned JUDGE, who gave it as his opinion that tne whole of the plate did not pass by the deed referred to above, but said that in case the verdict should be for the plaintiff he would give the defendant leave to move the Court in tanco on the construction of that document. The juryfounda verdict for the plaintiff-damages, 1001., to be reduced to Is. if the plate were given up.

Mr. WELSBY now moved for a rule to show cause why that verdict should not be set aside and a new trial had on the ground of misdirection and of the verdict being against the evidence, In or about the year 1849 one Evan Hughes obtained nermission to try for lead upon the estate of Lord Willoubrby d'Eresby, and after having made several trials took as coadventurers the other plaintiffs. The undertaking proceeded more or less vigorously until 1853, when their labours slackened so much that it was doubtful whether the mine was worked one day in a month, which, by the usage of the country, is necessary to prevent a forfeiture. Under these circumstances Lord Willoughby d'Eresby gave a license to work this mine to the defendants, who dug the ore, which was the subject of this action, and put it into an outbuilding, when the managing partner of the defendants' firm refused to comply with the plaintff9 demand and give it up. This was the conversion complained of. At the trial it appeared that the license to the plaintiffs was given by one Owen, his lordship's sub-agent, but whose actual authority only extended to making inquiries about the solvency of the applicants, and mentioning them to Kennedy, the head agent, whose sole duty it was to make the lease. hEr. Kennedy himself gave the lease to the defendants, but not only did he not grant either a license or a lease to the plaintiffs, but he was never even made acquainted with it. The learned counsel now argued that, even if a wrong had been committed by the conversion of the ore, that was only the wrong of the nnanaging partner alone, w ho had merely authority to hind the partnership by his lawful, and not his unlawful acts;* that the sub-agent had no authority to grant the license to the plaintiffs, and, at all events, that such a license wvas revokable, and had either been forfeited by the non-working, or revoked by the subsequent dealings with the defendants, and that all these questions should have been left to the jury. The COURT granted a rule to show cause. EVANS V. HLRRIS. This was an action of slander, tried before Mfr. Justice Williams at the last assizes at Haverfordwest, in which the juy returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with 201. damages. M1r. GIFFARD now moved for a rule to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, on the grounds of the improper reception of evidence, of misdirection, and of the verdict being against the evidence; or to reduce the damages to 5.,, pursuant to leave reserved. It appeared that the plaintiff is aninnkeeper in the neighbourhood of Haverfordwest, and on the day in question he and the defendant had been to a funeraL. They afterwards returned to the' plaintiffs inn to have something to drink, and there a discussion arose as to the merits of a man named Vaughan. Him the defendant disparaged. The plaintiff retaliated on behalf of his friend, and eventually the defen,dant uttered the words complained of-Vi ., "Thou art the biggest rogue in the conty; thou dost cheat the whole country. Thou art a swindleryes, a top swindler." It was alleged as special damage,. that three customers had ceased to deal with the plaintiff, but they were not called as witnesses, nor was any evidenee given of the fact. The learned judge, however, allowed a witness to be asked, whether "his business had suffered a sensible diminution?" to which question of course an answer in the affirmative was returned, and it was stated that the plaintiff had recently builta highly decorated room for the use of the Odd Fellows, who refused to go to the house any more unless a jury should give such subsantial damages as wrould show that m their opinion-he was not a chest and a swindler. The jury inthe first instance returned a verdict for the pLaintiff with 51. damages, butupon his lordship asking them what wasthesunatheyhadgiven for the slander, and what for the loss of business, they again retired, and on second thoughts found a verdict for 20a. Tlhe COURT granted a rule xisi, on the grounds that the damage was not shown to flow immediately from the words of the defendant, and that the extraordinary conduct of the jury wvas primd facie a reason for setting aside the verdict. SLADE V. SEABORN. This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Cresswell at the last summer Glocestershire Assizes, in which a verdict was given for the plainiiff with 221. damages. - Mr. SmYTHIES now appeared to move for a rule to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial, when Mr. Baron BReAMWELL, who had a short time ago presided at the trial of the defendant for perjury, arising out of his evidence in this cause, interposed, and said that he could state the facts in a very few words, which he proceeded to do to the folloxving effect .-The action was brought for 221, the price of a dray alleged to have been sold by the plaintiff a manufacturer of drays, to the defendant, at Newport Agricultural Show. The plaintiff swore most Dositively that he sold it to the defendant, that the defenaant paid him 11. on account, and that a regular invoice-which wa produced-was given, charging him with the price of the dray, and givinz credit for 17. It also appeared that the plamntiff, when -he went home, sent a bill for the detendant to accept for the amount, and that no answer was returned for upwards of a week, when a letter was sent, repudiating the whole affair. In answer to this the defendant swore that he never bought the dray at all, that he lent the plaintiff l1. to enable him to get homne, and that he took the invoice, because the plaintiff made some excuse about the difficulty of procuring an I O U. This story seemed so improbable that the jury at once found a verdict for the plaintiff, and the learned judge expressed so strong an o nion upon the subject that the defendant was indicted at 1 the Old Bailey for ;erju;y. 4 At the trial there the prisoner produced two highly respectable men as witnesses, who swore that this was an attempt to make him buy the dray, that the plaintiff had taken it to the defendant's premises at Newport, and pressed him to make a bargain, and that when he refused the plaintiff borrowed 11. of the defendant, under the pretence that he had not money enon.h to get home. They swore, too, that when the defendanas back wae turned the pl intiff pulled out a roll of baninotes and said, "Oh, thats all a trick; I only want to get It. out of him." As to the invoice, they swore that the defendant asked the plaintiff for a memorandum; and upon the plaintiff offering him the invoice he said, "I won't take that," to which the pl!aintiff replied, "Then I shall say you bought the dray." The prosecutor was then recalled, and asked if there was any tbuth in this story9 "Whereuon," continued the learned judge, "hehung down his heXaand slunk out of the witness.box." The prisoner was acquitted, and the jury expressed an opon that Ahe left the court without any inputation upon his character.- The COonv at once granted a rule to show cause. (SWin9s at Niel Pr-ur, beforc Mr. Baron MARTIN anid Common Juriet.S ATEIN V. HIID. This was an action brought to recover damages fora libel upon the plaintiff's character alleged to have been published by the defendant. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty." Mfr. Edwin James and Mr. Dowdeswell appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Bell represented the defendant. Mr. EDWivN J.A&us, in opening the case, said it would scarcely be conceived the importance this investigation would beto the plaintiff and other lace manufacturers in Nottingham. In London people were scarcely aware of the extent to which proceedings similar to that for which this action had been brought were carried on by the workmen in Nottingham. The plaintiff was a gentleman of very considerable property in that town, and the defendant was a poster of bills and a very poor man. The object was not to oppress him with costs, although he was backed by very large subscriptions, as would be shoun to them, for although he had not himself the maeans of purchasing the. paper which constituted the brief of his learned friends, vet 'he hadl procured those gentlemen to defend him, which had been done by means of those subscriptions raised among the workmen. The defendant might have been indicted, but Mr. Atkin thought the present actioa. more reasonable, as he wished to get at the bottom of the affair. In lMa some of his workmen began to dictate ter as to him as wel as otheremployers, and, m consequence, Mr. Atkin dismissed two persons who were in his em lo ent. There was a society called th a he mut the Union," who sent to him and told wim that he must takc back those two men or thev would not allowi anybody else to work for him. Upon his refusal they heat his men 'and used ever method of irtimidation to prevent them going to the plaintiff's premises to work. Placards were Posted up-'in thie town and in the surrouding villages, and the following libel was posted up by thedefendant, who, itwasclear, wasindemnified byvthe commnittee who had employed him to cost it onthe walls: "I Atkin's Lock Out. "To the lace trade of Nottingham and its vicinity. "Mr. M. Atkin, of the Mansfield-road Factory, still continues his malicious opposition to the lace-makers because some of them dared to subscribe a few pence per week towards the support of their fellow-workmen who had been sacrificed for not taking an. abatement offered them by him. On that occasion he at once, and without any other cause, locked the factory doors and turned the men out into the street. And did they then ask to go back? We answer, ' No,' and say all honour is due to the men in refusing to be made the tools and slaves of such a man, whose evident intention was to turn them away, thinking they would come and humble themaselves to get back into his employment, to give him a better opportunity to use them for the accomplishment of his own base and nefarious purposes, which, while they lower ad degrade the man who attempts to practise them, will also inevitably, if allowed to go unexposed and unchecked, endangerthe moral and social position of the working man, as weD as those honourable employers who wish to pay a just and proper price to those they employ. " llr. Atkin, finding himuself disappointed in the abovenamed preject, what did he do? Did he offer tlcometo any reasonable settlement of the dispute in question ? We say, 'No,' but, as an outlet to his angry and revengeful feelings, he engaged spies to mix among the men to excite them to say or do something to entrap them within the meshes of the law. His sole aim and object have been to get parties convicted, whether guilty or not; in fact, he has not shrunk from any meanness [or dirty trick; the difference between right and wrong, dignity and shame, has scarcely been felt, and truth itself appears disagreeable to him, as w,itness the case of three parties who were brought before the borough magistrates on the 19th of December, charged with using abusive and threatening language to his pretending workmen on the previous Thursday evening, at 12 o'clock p.m., in the factory-yard. "Mr. Atkin was the first witness examined, and he swore that he had been loitering about for some time near Elm-avenue, and close to the factory where he heard the alleged abuse take place; but it was proved by a respectable witness that he was against the Bluecoat-school at two minutes before 12 o'clock; and several other witnesses were present who, if they had been called upon, would have proved to have seeii him at other places at the time he stated he was witness to what took place in the factory-yard, thus proving himself forsworn. It is quite evident that he had premeditated a disturbance to excite some arties to breaL- the peace. The unusaal manner his "blacksheep" behaved in the yard, and the breathless speed he was seen running at from the town with his bludgeon in his hand, all go to prove it; but, fortunately, he was too late, and only arrived to meet the men nearly at the top of Great Alfred-street. Of the parties he brought to prove his case, some swore the lights at the factory were burning, and others swore they were out. On the whole, probably more contradictory evidence never was heard, and ultimately the magistrates dismissed the case. How he came to perjure himself we know not, except it was through theadvice of his legal adviser, who once told the Lace Trades' Committee, when they employed him, that he would not give a - for a witness who could not see an object through a 9-inch wall. (The placard then went on to condemn the partiality' of the newspapers in reporting the convictions of the men but not mentioning them when they were acquitted.) By order of the Comnaittee of persons unjustly prosecuted by M1anuel Atkin. Printed by SeweD, Holmes, and Co., Friar-wall, London." All Mr. Atkin did was to refuse to take back into his employment the two men whom he had dismissed on reasonable grounds. It was impossible to state the tyranny which was exercised over the masters by these societies. That placard was posted at7'clock one morningin January by the defendant It appeared to have been printed by Sewell, Holmes, and Co., Friar-wall, London. :Now, there were no such persons as so stated, neither was there such a place as Friar-wall, in London. As to the damages, it was very essential that this sort of placards should be put a stop to. It was impossible that they could recover any damages from the defendant. Their verdict must be such a one as would mark their sense of the proceedings of persons seeking to intimidate the masters who had discharged their workmen for reasonable causes. The following evidence was then called:- Mr. Manuel Atlin.-I am the plaintiff. I am a lacmanufacturer at Nottingham. In the month of July last I had seven lace machines at work. 'There were 14 men engaged upon those machines. Among those men were two named Peat and Hallet. They were dismissed. Mr. Serjeant SiHEE.-AIl that we shal contend is, that the defendant had nothing at all to do with posting the libel, so you need not ask questions which do not touch upon that point. Mr. Atkin.- In consequence of that dispute I discharged them. I afterwards saw Mr. West, the secretary to the trades union. In consequence of what passed the other 12 men quitted my employment. Thev then proceeded to picket themselves round the premises to prevent any other persons coming in. I afterwards saw this placard upon the wall. I saw the defendant posting it upon the wall. They were posted all over the towvn andvillages around. M1y servant Crampton was with'me, and saw him posting it up. My attention was called to this other placard, the subject of this action, some time in December. This has reference to the same matteras to the otherwhich I sawvthe defendant post. The defendant is a common billsticker. Mry solcitor sent for the defendant, and said " You have been posting some bills?" to which he replied, "II have posted many a thousand." My solicitor salid, "But you have been postingsome of the latter bils7?" The defendant replied, "No I have not." My solicitor then told him he should come to no harm if he would only tell him who had given them to him. The defendant said he would not tell him, and asked what he was going to give him for his trouble of coming up. My solicitor told him that he must think himself well off getting offso well, and that he would be served with a copy of a writ. The defendsan said he had got nothing, ithey did bring an action againt him. Cross-examined.-I have brought two actions against other persons. MEy attorney has called upon twrO other parties. I have proceededon,ly against billstickers and pub- cans. I had never seen the defendant before I saw him sticking up the bills. The defendant denied having posted the bils. I had had a conversation, previous to the one lie had ivith my attorney, with the defendant, when he partially admitted that he had posted them. The attorney sudthat he couldfind Plenty of witnesses to prove that thw defendant had pose them.. The attorney did not say, " I will make you remember it." I had before attempted to pump the defendant. That was in the refreshment-room of the theatre. I gave hirn several glasses of ale. When he had taken the third I thought he was ready fov examina. tion. I then asked him if he stuck bills, to which he plied "Yes." I said, "For any one " to which he relied; "Yes: we are notproud chaps." I asked himif he hadany of Atkin's bills. He said he had not any of them. I don't 'recolect saying that Mr. Ordoin printed them. I asked Priestly to examine him. Re.examined.-These bis have done very great harm indeed. In consequence of them I can't get men to work for me, and they insult my wife and myself in the streets. I was very anxious to find out who had ordered them to be posted. Mr. Ordoin is a printer at Nottingham. Mr. Bowley.-I am an attorneyat Nottingham. WhatMr. Atkhn said was correct as to what the defendant said. The plaintiff has brought actions against three others. If we hear no more of it we will drop the action at once, and I will undertake not to ask for any costs at all. Charles Field.-I am engaged in the detective force. I have been endeavouring to find out if there are such persons as Sewell, Holmes, and Co., at Friar-wall, London. There is no such place as Friar-wall, London, neither have I found any such persons. George Cramnpton.-I was formerly with Mr. Atkin'is father as groom. I was driving M-. Atldn in September last, when I saw the defendant posting a bill. I asked for one of them. This is a copy. He told me that he had none to giveaway; iewas paid for posting, and he shi'nld not be paid if he did not postthem. John Priestly.-I live at Nottingham. I know the de- fendant. I know awall at the top of Walleton-street, Not- tingham. I saw the defendant posting X biM on that waUX about 9 o'clock on a morning of January last. store it down, and I produce the identical portion I tore down. I tore it down about three weelks afterwards. Cross-exanined.-I read a portion of the bill when I saw him post it. I as esting bils myself. I read the top and the bottom oftheb Ididnotreadthebody ofthebil I swear that I saw him post that very bil which I tore down. Mr. Atk-in asked me if I knew who posted those bills. I spoke to the defendant about them. Ieeexamined.-I sAw the name of Manuel Atkin at the bottom of the bilL Charles Cox said, he was in an architect's office in. Nottingha He knew the defendant. About Christmas he saw the defendant posting bills on a blank walL He saw them signed at the bottom as that one was. Cross-examined.-He knew the defendant as check-taker at the theatre. Re.examined.-LHe had seen another bil which he had also read. Mr. Atkin recalled and examined by Mr. Serjeant SmEE. -I have brought several placards here. I took some of ,hem off the walls. Thero is a portion of one sticdng up gaunst the wall now. -By Mr. JA3VEs.-I have-neier seen any other bill except the one complained'of, signed " Manuel Atkin." Mr. Serjeant S=x, in addressing the jury for the defendant, sid, he perfectly agreed.with his learned friend in. condemning these placards as being entirely wrong. He did not in the least complain'of Mr. Atkin having endeavoured to find out who had printed and published these placards. The defence would be, that the defendant never id stick up one of the placards complainedof. He would call the man who reallydid- stick them up, who would exonerate the defendant entirely. If the action had been 1 brought upon any of the other bills which the defendant had stuck up, the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover. The two witnesses who had been called by the plaintiff to prove the placard having been stuck up by the defendant were mistaken in the identity of the bnls. They were not interested in the dispute, and had not, therefore, taken much notice of it. So little was Mr. Atkdn satisfied with the evidence he had got that he had endeavoured to Pump the defendant himself after administering ale to him. Even then the defendant had denied having been guilty of doing what was complained oE. Uinder these circumstances their verdict ought most undoubtedly to free the defendant fromthe consequences of this action. 'The-folEowingevidence was then adduced on the part of the defendant:- William Hind.-I am the defendant, and a billsticker in Nottingham. I see that bill I have seen it before upon the walls at Nottingham. I never posted a bill like that. I posted some last summer for the committee, but they were not like the one complained of. I have a partner named William Marr. Neither he nor I have had any bills put into our hands like that to post. I post for thetheatre, and I take checks there. I was sent for by Mr. Atkin to the saloon of the theatre ; I went down and saw him. He asked me if I would take a glass of ale?. I did. He said, "Take another." I did. He said "Will vou take a cigar?" I said, " Thank you, Sir." I had drunk up the ale asfa$s as I could, and was going away whenhe said, "Take another.", I said, "Very well; I will, for the pood of the house." I did take another, and while I was drkiDng it he said, "You post biUs, don't you'l" I said I did; and he said, " Doyoudoitforanybody" Isaid, "Yes; we are not proud chaps." e asked me if I couid post any bills secretly? To which I replied, I could; but. I must be well paid for it. He asked me if I had any of Atkin's bills about me-they were nice bills? I said,Ihad not. I told him I did not know whether Mr. Ordoi had any of them. On the following MondayI met my partner, who told me 3r. Bowley wanted me. I went to Bowle, who said, "You. have been posting some bilse" I said Ihad. "Ah! but," he said, " you have been posting some about Atkin." , I said I had not done so. Atldn said that he could find 20 people to prove it. I said, he could not, because I had not. done so. I asked him if he was going to nay me for mv irouble in coming up to him, as Iknewthat he did not worM for nothing, and neither did L e said, " I will pay you, and send you a writ." I said, I did not care. Cross-exauiin ed.-I goon the stage sometimes as well as take the checks. I don t do the "heavy business." I don't go on when the play is on. This bil was given to me to post. It was brought to my house. I did not post .a thousand. It was brought to me by the chairman of the committee. I don't know his name. I swear I don't. I was paid at a publichouse by the chairman of the committee. I defend this action myself. I don't know who is the attorney for the committee. I don't know whether my attorney is. Iearn 1i. per week. I defend myself. There is a subscription raised for me to defendimyself. I have pcaid my atterney. That was with money subscribed for my defence by my friends in Nottingha. I have posted bills against the Wal in Rutland-street and other places. I don't knowy where the plaintif's premises are. -I will swear that I can't tell who the chaira was. There is a fresh chairman every quarter. I swear I did not say that I knew what I was wanted for when I was told to go to the plaintiffs attorney. I said I thought I knew. I know the man who posted this. He is William Webb. I sometimes employ him. I employ him most weeks. I have had nothing to do with the placard headed " Atkin's Black Sheeps" I pay Webb by the day. might have given Webb some of those bills-none upoen which this action is brought. I am billsticker toethe committee. IE sometimes get the bills from the printer, or they are brought to my house. - Re-examined.-I am paid at the end of the week-by the committee. Wiliam Marr said, he was the partner of the last witness. He had seen the placard in question. Neither he nor his partner nor anybody in his employ had stuck them up. None of them had ever been in his possession. He had never employed Webb to stick them up. He could not have stuck them up without his knowledge. Cross-examined.-He had posted bils for the committee. Webb was a journeyman billsticker. He stuck bills for WilYam Webb.-I am a bilisticker, of Nottingham I have done all the mischief. I have stuck up the bil in question. Iwasgoirgupabacklane,and a man caine up tome and asked me if I would stick some biUls-about 150? He said they must be stuck up in the town and the vilages. I said I would do so for 5s. When I got home I found the bills on the table and 5s. 6d Lfor my pay. I stuck them up. I don't know the name of the person who spoke to me. I don't think I had ever seenhim before. I never stuck them up for the defendant. Cross-examined.-I am sure I don't know the name of the man whogave them to me. Re-examined.-I can't read, and therefore I knewnothing about the bills. I know nothing about the committee. I never saw the man either before or since. Be showed me the size of thebillsin his a ron whenhe met me; * was in the employment of the defndant and his partner. That being the end of the defendant's case, Mr. Serjeaut SiEE summed up the defendant's evidence. Mr. BD-wn JAMES replied upon the whole case. Mr. Baron MAsTIN, in summing up, said, the charge against the defendant w,as that he was guilty of publishing a libel upon awall in Nottingham, and there was no doubt but this was a case of most considerable importance. It seeied that, according to the statement of the men themelves, the plaintiff had dismissed two of his men with whom he was dissatisfied, and thereupon the remaining 12 men in his employ entered into a subscription for their support. Heha a perfect right not to allow persons in his employ to ily an ins face,and contribute to thesupport of the men whom he had discharged. If a man was to be free in this couwntry he must not be compelled to employ Persons whom he did not choose to have in his service. It would onlybe an abuse of the rord freedom. 'Tat was the statement of the men themselves. The committee then began to libelothe plaintiff, and he must say that the learned counsel for the defence, although instructed by the attorney for the come mittee, had spoken of those libeis in terms which went much o his honour and credit. The act of Parliament had very properly ordered that whenever anyh paper was printed the printer should put - his name at the bottom, and in this case the commtittee had placed a forged name at the bottom of the placard in question, and thus prevented the plaintiff from finding out the printer, thus, again, whying in the face of the law. The plaintiHf being baffled one way took the nexitobvious course open to him, which vas to goito the man who had put up the formler Placards, to find,if possible, the right parties. That man had~ comne before them to-day, andswore that he did not know the names of the parties -who had given him the former hills, which he admitted havin, pasted up, and who had paid him;* and also had brought another man to swear that he had done it, and not the defendant. The jury must say what credit they attached to that man's evidence, and if they believed him of course their verdict would be for the defendant. If they found for the plaintiff, he would leave the amount of damages entirely in their hands; for it was clear the defend. ant was a man who was* most unfit to pay any damages at all. The jury, after a short consideration, returned a verdict for the plaintiff,-Damages, 1501. Mr. Baron MIARTIN said, he hoped that their verdict would prove a lesson to the people in Nottingham of the consequences of the real delinquent being discovered and brought before ajury.
ADEIIRALTY COURT. SATURDAY. APRTT. 19 '=EE BORUSSIA.-COLLISION. (Before Dr. LusnnmGToN.1 lmis was an action brought by the bark Therese against the steamship Bornssiatorecover the loss arising from a collision between them at 8.45 p.m. on the 15th of November last in Hull-roads. The Therese was lying at anchor, and, according to her account, the Borussia, proceeding in tow of a steamtug from the Victoria to the Hunmber dock, ran against her and did her considerable damage. The Borussia, after alleging that the damage sustained vas very slight, attributed the collision to the default of those on board.the Therese in not having a proper light suspended and in not keepg a saficient lookout. If her helm had been ported and her cable paid out, it was said no collision would have coccurred. Dr. Addams and Dr. Spinks appeared for the Therese; Dr. Jenner and Dr. Deane for the Borussia. The learned Juios., having conferred with the Elder Brethren by wiom he was assisted, said, they were of opinion that it was exceedingly imprudent for the Borassia to have been moved that night m charge of a steamtug, and that very considerable risk was likely to arise from her so doing. 'The lights on board the Therese were not proper and correct lights, but those who had charge of the tug were not deceived in consequence of any defect in the lights, and Ihey did not, when they discovered them, adopt fit and proper measures to avoid the collision. The Borussia, therelore, was to blame. Decree accordingly. THlE zOLLVERE-COLU5ION. This was a suit promoted by the brig Pet, proceeding coalladen from Seaham to London, against the brig Zollverein, I ound from London to the Tyne in ballast, to recover for a total loss occasioned by reason of a collision between them at 3.30 am., on the 12th of November last, offlFlamborough Head. The Pet was on the port tack, close-hauled, and according to her account she descried the Zollverein rning free four points on her port bow, distantaboutaquarter of a mile from her and approaching apparently as if to crossiler hawse. A bright signal lantern was immediately shown over the Pet's port bow, and the Zoliverein was repeatedly hailed, but no notice was taken of it until it Was too late, when she suddenly ported her helm and ran into the Pet, in consequence of which she speedily sank ard an apprentic~e was drowned. The Zollverein in her defence aleged that the fog was so thick that she did not discern the light of the Pet until she was within two ships' length; that she instantly ported her helm;, but the Pet, which wtas carrying all her sails, continued her course and ran inlto the Zolvereit. Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss were heard for the Pet, the Queen's-Advocate and Dr. Deane for the Zoibverein, The learned JUIDGE, after consulting with the Elder Brethren, said, they were of opinion that the Zollverein was to blame for having continued to sail too close to the other lightvesse, andso occasionedthe light of the Pet to be obscured. E- eonseqnence' thereot the Zollverein's helm vtas ported too late to avoid the colision. With respect to the Pet, they were of opinion that there were no circumstances intbiscaseto render a departLre from the rule laid down in the act of Parliament necessay to avoid :immediate danger. lAstly, they thought that the collision 3might have been avoided by porting the helm of the Pet, as there was ample time so to have done. If there had been no act of Parliament, the Pet would have been justified in keeping her course and not porting. A question was then reserved for discwusion on Fxiday next-namely, whether, under -the circumstances, the act of Parliament applied to the Britishveasel the Pet.

Mr. Maule appeared as counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Pearce for the defence. - The following is a condensed account of the voluminous additional evidence given after the former depositions were read:- Mr. A. J. Mason said, on re-examination, I should ndt have given the order for the-payment of the pension towhich the prisoner had been entitled as the widow of Archibald Nair if. she had not so, represented herself. She would not have been entitled to receive any money unless she had been the widow of an offiicer of the Company. John Duncum, beadle of St. Mary, Stratford, lBow, said, I produce a book of the registry of marriages in that parish; in wvhich is an entry on the 28th of Mfay, 1846, which bas my name and that of lIarris7 the parish clerk, to it. Iwas present at the solemnizition of the mariage alluded to mn it. The Rev. G. T. Grifeld.-I was rector of the parish in 1846, and officiated at the marriage alluded to in No. 450,but I cannot remember who the parties were. TheRegister stated that the marriage was soleumnied on the 28th of May, 18n4i, between Joseph Charles Minikenand Mary M'Nair. Mr. S. P. Low, partner in the firm of Grindley and Co., agents to the Madras Military Fund, said, as agents to the fund we issue certificates. One of the annultants was the widow of Archibald M'Nair, to the amount of 136. 7Ts. 6d. We have issued certificates for that pension upon the declaration of aunuitants, and I have issued some upon the declaration of Mary Eliza WM'Nair. On the 5th of this month the defendant called upon me with a declaration in the regulated form. I asked her if she was Mrs. 3TNair9 She said she was. I then asked her if she intended that Mr. Codd should not draw the pension in future, and she replied that such was her wish. I said, from whatoccurred in 1146, 1 should be obliged to write to Mr. Codd before yment of the pension, and she could come again on Monday. She called on the MIonday, and I showed her a letter we had received from Mr. Codd (the letter referred to thereport that shewasmarried); and she requested a copy. I told her she must write for one, and I asked her if the contents were true, and if she was prepared tomakeaffidavit that she was not married, to which shedidnuotreply. I told her I must write to llr. Coddfor the proof of what he 'bad alluded to, and that the case should go before the Home Committee of the fund. I also asked her if she' knew whether her children were alive? -She said she believed-theywere, but - she had not heard from them for some time. I said she ought not to have-included their names in the declaration of their being actuay alive, unless she knew it was true. I had futher conversation with her as to what took place in 1846, and I received a letter from her subsequently. Ibelieve it to be in- her handwriting, for I have seen her vriting four times every year since 1845. On the 14th inst. she again called at my office. She was sitting therein custody of an officer when I went in, ancl she asked me ta lend her a sovereign, and particularly begged that -I would not inform her children. I told her it would be better not to s3y anyhg to me, as it might be used against her. She said she had no money in her pocket, anda told her the officer would allow her to communicate withherfriends, as in the position in which I stood it would be impossible for me to lend her any money. -I have looked at the entry, 450, in the parish register, and I believe the writing, "M ary .hiniken, to behers. (The entrywas here read.) Cross-examined.-I believethe defendant has three initials " L A. E.". The signature in the entry of which I speak is "Mary Miniken." I form my opinion from the wotd "Mary" especially, and I also form it from the general character ofthe writing. If the word M'Nair had been written after "Mary" I should have issued the pension upon it. Mr. A. Bennet.-I have been 19 years clerk to Messrs. Codd the army agents They were agents to Mrs. 31ary Ehlza M'Nair. for the receipt of pension from the East India Company, as the vwidow of Captain Archibald tINair, since the year 1843. She was introduced by the son of Mr. Caniken, who signed his name as " Augstus a3linikenat I have frequently seen her sign her name. To the best of my belief the words "Mary Miniken" in the register-book are in her handwriting. The witness then corroborated several parts of the evidence of Mhr. Lw, andproduced aleteir signed "aM. E. ntNair," denyig that she was married, and stating th ththe letter Messrs. Grindley had received bad bceen written by her deadly enemy, who was a prisoner in the Queen's Bench, and had been a mere mining adventurer. Capain Ef. IEng, of Devaies, said he was a lieutenant in the Mtadras *Native Inftntry. HEe had 70oined it in 1829. and left it in March, 1832. He knevv Captain Archibald h'Nair, whovwas then a heutenaut. Remembered when 'Nair married, and identified the defendant sat e widow the moment he saw her in court. Rlemembered having seen 'an account of the death of Caitit n t 'Nair in the papers. Nobody had comr.unicated with him upon the subject of giving evidence, but he had seen an accout in the newspapers of the first examination, and he had come forward accordingly. It was proved that the defendan"t had lived in a house in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-courtroad with a gentleman who was beLeved to be and passed as her husband that they were known as Mr. and Irs. Gray; and that letters had been -receivedat the house directed to or. Miniken,to the careof M ur. Gray. Mr. Pearce submitted to the Alderman that there was not adequate proof of identity bo justify the committal of the lady at the bar. Alderman Wnis3 said, the evidence-of ident-ity by collateral circumstances was quite strong enough to sanction him in sending the case before another tribunal. The prisoner, upon being asked accordingrtopthe usual form whether she w,ished to say anything, said, "No, I reserve my defence." p The COUrt was during the examination filled with respectable people. t Gten erLsL.-iohn Quaid, a blacksmith, and Peter Peters, a gasfitter, were charged with committing a most a-whovated assault upon John Banner, and also upon the police while in the execution of their duty. s John Banner stated that on the 10th of .arch he was walkine along S insbury-npavement, when Petes came behind him and gave him a slap on the face. Be turned round to remonstrate with him, wheu Qusaid struck him i the face and knocked him down. He then grappled with Quaid and called for the police, but they both kioked him about the body until he was compelled to let him go. e e followed them and gave them into the custody of the police in Moorgte-strect, when they directed their attack upon them, ine went to the hospital, an. was laid up for three weeks afterwvards. Henry Gin, police constable 166, said, he was called to take the prisoners into custody. He took held of Peters, who immediately comemenced kicding his legs The crowd called to him to take out his staf, and he did so, but he got hold of the staff and prevented hic using it. Ham, the beadle of St. Stephen's, and three other constable, camn to his assistance and took the prisoners to the statlonlhouse. Beth the prisones attacked him furiously, and by the time assistance came he was quite exhausted. He was-unable to assist in taking the prisoners to the station iu consequence of the injuries he had received, and when begot there two constables helped him upstairs to bed, where he had been ever since unable to leave his room. E3dward Mlitchell, 126., said, that on the 10th of March he was callod to aasist Gin, and on arrvmngat the s,eot he found him completely exhausted, and the prisoners puuIoned by four or five gentlemen. They cautioned him to be careful, for Peters would kick him- and as he attemptedto take' him into custodyThe did malke a k kat his head, whichtook effect on Rischa orly rOther constables c me up, and they were obliged to strap the prisoner's legs, and it took four policemen to convey him to the stationbouse. These facts' were corroborated by numerous other wit-- nesses, and MEr. C. S. Smith, assistanut to the surgeon to the po]iceforce, deposed totheinjuries Gin had received, which were of a very serious nat-ure. Alderman CARTE}] said, the case was too serious for hum to dispose of, and he should thereirore commiit the prisoners - for triaL- Bow-smssa'.Three well-lcnown butrglars, named James Horrigan, Richard Sheresmith, and George Williama (the latter a tiCket-of-leave man;, were tired, on remnand, with attempting to break into a 3ouse in Surrey-street, Strand, On Tuesday week some childrx Am ene of the prisoners ascending a ladder which had been uaed-during the repair of a house in Surrey-street, and as-the ladilerhad been removed from the opposite side of the way the -circumstance excited suspicion. An alarm was raised, And a policeman (Holmes 50 ), who happened to be in charge of an empty house close at hand, was soon in pursuit. Heascended the ladder, and found the first two prnsoners ohJtEe roof of 28, Surreystreet, armed with a collection oro 3oiseebreakdng implements, such as jimmies, skeleton k,yzc:&c. The prisoners, fnding themselves detected, threwwdowheevariousarticles and triedto escape overthe roofs of ie iidjoi:nighouses;but they were pursued by the officer, *fio7toon received the assistance ofInspector Mackenzieana, fhPr constables ;upon which the prisoners " gave in," and said they would go to the station quietly. WiUiams was afterwards apprehended by Silverton, A 323, who knew him to be the associate of the otherprisoners, andit was proved that on the night in question, when the polioe were hastening to the assistance of Holmes, Williams wasin the Strand, and contrivedto put one of the officers " off the scent," by teling him that - tl4 housebreakinghad -occurred in another direction altogeter. Villiams,it also appeared, was the man who was-sogie timne sinoe rescued from the Middlesex-hospital by his tompanions, having been-admitted witha broken leg, caused ` a previous attempt to escape from the police. He was defended uponthe present charge by Mr. Lewis, and acquitted. 'The other prisoners were committed for triaL MAxmoRo1oGH-sTrsRTOne of the most extraordiny cases of a continuous and successful series of forgeries on bankers and private persons in town and country ever detailed in a police-ourt-was brought to a close on Bmiday by the apprehension of three brothers, John Ingram Owen, eorge Smith Owven, and Edward Owen, bwhom the detective police for at least 18 months have been in pursit of. T'he nmuber of cases in wPhich the forgers have been completely successful, already traced by the police, ranges between 30 and 40, and the sums obtained, in about 18 months, fall very little short of 3,000L Edward Owen, about two or three years ago, lived as clerk with Mr. Jeals, stove manufacturer, Museum-street; John Ingram Owen was a clerk in the Custoom-house, but dismised. for misconduct, and George Smith Owen, brought up in the drug line, had akind oE of fice at 12, Tower-street, as ag,ent for wholesale druggists. Some years ago the father of the prisoners was in extensive business at Shrewabury as a; woollen-draper, - but he failed, and it wvas on this banl;ruptcy-that the superstructure of forgery 'was afterwrards raised. -The first case of forgery traceultothe prisoners was on 3fessrs. Contts and or 1by~the prisoner Edward, who, through his sister, became acquainted with the handwriting of a lady who kept cash at Coutt's. - This took place about 18 or 20 mnonthsago. Thepolicewere sentinpursuitoftheforger - -they traced him by railwaytoKingstoa, then into a haciney brougham, when theylost him. One of the prisoners gave out that he had just returned with a large fortune from -Australia. He had cards printed, giving his address at Peel. rRiver, Australia, and he announced that he had returned to.England for the sole purpose of paying all his father's ,creditors in fulL With checks preparedbeforehand one or-the other of the brothers waited on the creditors in succes-- sion, and by a plausible story snuceeded in disarming sus-- picion and inducing the creditors to take the checks, which |were always for a larger amount than the debt, and to give i their own- checks for the difference. In most instances|these good checks were made the foundation for larger - forgeries, and in this way considerable sums were obtained - from bankers-.at Shrewsbury, Taunton, Salisbury, Poole, the London- and Westninster, Herries and Co., Grote, Prescott, and Co., Bath, Trowbridge, Manchester, &c. In- - formation of these repeated forgeries was forwarded to'Scotland-yard, and several of the most experienced of the detectives, among whoma were Police-sergeants Smith and. Williamson, w,ere specially retained byessrs. Mullens and. wo., on behalf of the bankers, to apprehend the forgers, Theforgerscoid notstir sithout being dogged by the de- tectives; if they went into the country the telegraph wasputinto,requisition, and the count-.police were on the alett. The detectives Smith and Wlliamrson would not. follothemt well knowing, as they said,that when they had done the "job" in the country they would retrn to - tedn to their old haunts and associates in the Haymarket, where they spent the geater part of these dishone,t earn- - ings, and where one of themfrom his reCiless extravaganoce for sometime past, has been known under the name of "'hampagne George, fi The Stock Etxchange." The tele- graphwashserviceable on qu re-thanone occasion; the most - recent, howvever, appears to bethis-one of the prisoners took-- aplace to Frome, but thie telegraph doss not extend to that place. Consequently, the message had to be for-a - -warded part of- the way by train, and twhis delay enabled, the prisoner to mke his attempt. M{r. Shephoerd, of Frome, mn extensive cloth manufacturer, -was wted upon by one of the brothers with the old stop y af - beng about to discharge his father's debts, and he offered vi check for 1701., whichwas 1001. more than the balauce. or. Shepheerddid not quite like the transaction, and le puta. the apoicant offfor a day or so. The forger took the alarms startved o£toSaEesbury, andthenoe toBlth, wherethe country police, whowere by this time in possession of the telegraphic message; lost him. At length the exertions of the detectiveswere attended - with saccess; they succeaded in taking all three brothers into custo4y together. It appeared that Mr. Butter, umnbrella maker; Cheapeide, was one of the fater's creditors. He received a visit as few days ago from Edad, one of the brothers, who stated he came topay his father's debts, producing at the same time a check for 151., nnd receivingtbe balance in X check for 71. lOs. -As he was about to leave the shop he turned round ,to Mr. hatter, and said coolly,- " You cannot but acknowledge that my father has behaved like a gentleman to sou." Mr. latter assented. "WZell, then," said the Australian capitalist, " I think, as the-eatherappearssqually, youmight aswell make nme a present of ssnlmbrelLaY "Cihoose one," said MEr. Rultter. A guine aumbrella was selected, and both paries took-leave mutually pleased with their mornings work~ Mr. Ratter immediately published the -affair to his friends as a- fmne - trait inl- huma nature-filial piety engaged in re-establishing a parent's credit and character but bis views on the subject sustained a disagreeable revulsion by the-return of the forged check, and a communication from the police, whichoopened his eyes to the fact that he had lost m 10s.ind a umbrela, but had gained a new ",wrinkle." -On Eriday lst detectives SJith and Williamsonaccompaniedby Cfr-Rtter, follow ed one of the brothers into Clerkenvwell, a4d saw him enter a publichouse close to St. -John's-ate. it Asecond brother soon afterwards nade his appearance, and-went into the same publchouse. lDetective Smith followed,- and to his great gratification found all three brothers in the room. Edward was with his back to the fire,; Ingram was reading the - paper; and George was drinling ale. Detective Smith walked iup to the fireplace, and touching Edwarvl said. "Hab, Ed ward how do you do?" The brother thus ad- dressed, whohad madehimself look as much like a foreigner - as possible, replied in some kindof gibberish. "Come, drop that now," said Smith. "I belong tothe detectives.w I ant won and your two brothers here for forgery, and here is Mr. Rtntter,who knows something about that umbrella you have got in your hand." The three brothers blustered very rmuch at first, but the detectives Smith and Williamson would not be put of; and calling a cab, they succeeded in placing all three in it, after an abortive attempt on the part of Ingram to escape. The three brothers were lodged in the stationhouse, and on Saturday a preliminary examination took place before Ms. BI~SGH at Marlborough-street police-court. The amounts known to have been obtained by the prisoners are-by forgeries on Coutts, O l.;on hr. Jealces, 5101., Mr. Douglas, 113Z.; London ind Westminster '200Z.; Mr. Hall, 2i001. ; !essrs.Tlerries,UllS. - Messrs. Prescott, 150!. ; Taunt,on Bank, 200Z.; Salisbury BanL-, 1006. Poole Ban, 218Z. ; besides smaller amounts, the number oi - which are very considerable. To prove the dexterity and hairbreath- escapes of the pri- - soners, it will be necessary to state tht a bot purstut was set on foot by a -ictimwho recogniaqd one- of the brothers in Tottenham.court-oad The mob cbited a man with long blackhair; beard, and mustachios, wearing a brovn wideawake, into the Feathers publichouse, which has an entrance back and front.

So-unTvARK.-Xary Ann Reilly and Wiliam Ramsay, two desperate thieves, were brought up for final examina-- tion, charged with stealing a gold watch and chain, a-l10. Bank of England note, a 51.-note, a memorandum for I00M, a check for 50., and some gold and silver money, from the person of Nlathsniel Dower. The prisoners vere also charged with stealing a coat, -waistcoat, and a pocketbook from t.he same person. The prosecutor, a country-boolaig gentleman, stated that . he came ulp to London on Wednesday by the South-Eastern Railv;ay, and after leaving h ge at a friend's house he took a walk about to viewv the sghts of London. About 9 'clock at night he fel- in -with the woman in the Borough, and accompauied her to 2Nlio. 2, HaIrro-wstreet, in the M£int (one of the vworst localities in the metropohis), whBere he sent for some ale. The male pisoner then came into the roomn, and, after conversing with the woman aboutaninute, he left them. Theale was then brought in, and, after drinlcing a glass -be became so drowvsy that he felt an inclination to lie dowvn. The female prisoner then took him into a bedroom, and begot into bed in her presence. He soon fell asleep, andremuained so until about 5 o'clock in the morning, when he perecived himself alone in a dirty bed and a ithy room. He rubbed his eyes and looked about him, when he found his coat, waistcoat, and neckerchief gone. His watch and chain, which he had left on the table, were also gone as-well as all his property, consisting of his pocketbook, containing a memorandum for 1001., a draught for 501., a 101., and a 51. Bank of England note, some gold and silver, and a gold ng. He immediately roused the imates, when the landlady ctmeto him, and he related to herwhat had happened. She got him acoat and a hat, and told himthat shortly afterhe had entered the bedroom the femnale prisoner had quitted the house, which was a common lodginghouse. Information was then given to the: polioe, and awitness aferwards pzoceeded t o the BanIl and stopped the draught, memorandum, and the notes. Edwin Coleman, 53 X, said, he took the female prisonerinto custody in Finsbury, when she admitted stealing every thing from the prosecutor except the gold ring.

They havebeeni acquitted'ef tbe charge of conspiracy contained in the £Frst count. {i have read the documents and statements Laid be. fore .me y both parties. I am satisfied there is no sufficient ground for believing that any real distinction has beenz made etibezoy the masters of the school or by the boys them. se}-es in the treatient of boarders and foindation or day I boys; that the utmost im rtiality has in this respect been shown by the llev. Dr. lWelldon and the other mastes 2nder him, and that there is no reasonable evidence to show that any unfair or unequal system of fagging has ever been permitted by the masters, or even practised by the boys themselves. I regret to have read some parts of the correspolidence wvhich from time to time has passed between the Rev. 3Mr. Shepherd and Dr. Welldon. I should hope that the former, on more dispassionate refiection, will arrive, as I have done, at the conclusion that if all the parents of the scholar at Tonbridge School were to mieet Dr. Welidon, as Mr. Shepherd has done, tlle situation of the head master would be rendered alhnost intolerable to an honourable and worthy man. The assault and beating of the prosecutor by the two defendants was wholly indefensible; I cannot refrain from pointing out to them how disgraceful it was for boys of courage and goodfeeling to have used a cane in striking with soeie severity onie oftheir schoolfellows, and especially when lie was a boy much weaker than themselves. It Dr. Welldon had punished them for tbhat, even by personal chastisement, I should have entirely acquiesced in the justice of his decision. He may, perhaps, have had good reasonsforonly imposing ontheprincipal defendantthe punishmentwhichit seems he has suffered. This, indeed, wvas a question w chich should be left by reasonable people, slmnost neessarily, in his judgment alone and that of the visitors of the school. I disapprove the preferring an indictment for a conspiracy inl such a case as this, and most especially when done for the purpose avowed in the aibdavits laid before me. Ity judgment is that each of the twvo defendants do pay to the Crown a fine of VE., and be discharged. This judgment is to have in all respects the sa.me effect as if pronounced at the sashies."
THE MOOI'S IOTION. TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIhlS. Sir,-May I venture to trespass again on your indulgence for the privilege of replying to the letter of so eminent a mnathesnatician as Mr. V. Hopkins? He was little likely to be mistaken for Isis equally distinguished namesake, whom I had designated as a writer on geology; though I believe him to be skiled in dynamics, and a great authority thereon. Your correspondent is "astounded at my boldness" in questioning an astronomical dictuns, sanctioned by great philosophers. lBe it so ; the time has gone by for a popedom in science. Plain people are concerned in the truth of her dogmas. Nor will even the " scientific horror" of Mr. W. Hopkins deter the heretical tendencies of investigation, now that mninds are at work and thumbscrews banished. Inspectors of schlools, who are often censured for failing to effect plain instruction in common thinigs, are especially interested in the distinctness and correctness of the information on such subjects given inhbooks which philosophers indite for schools. Their accuracy, therefore, is a question of more importance than my audacity in endeavouring to clear up a practical point in elementary instruction, which Mr. Hopkins admits is in periodical doubt. Mr. Hopkins maintains that if the nmoon in her orbit turns the same hemisphere constantly to the earth, that is rotary motion round her ovn axis. Will he pen-nit me to suggest to him the difficulties which occur to the profansum vuZgus in tlius defining the moon's motion ? In the first place, how is the earth's motion to be distinguished frons the moon's motion? They are clearly different; for the latter alrways presents the same hemisphere to its centre (the earth), while the earth presents different liemispheres to its centre (the sun). That kind of rotation which take3 place on an axis within the rotating body the moon clearly has not, or she msust present all lier sides successively to the earth, or to any point within her orbit. I do not under stand Mr. Hopkins to dispute this. If he does, I must refer him to " E. B. D.'s" tin mnoon, and the experiment whereby that urbane person has so ingeniously confuted himself. The motion which Mr. Hopkins terms the rotation of the moon on her owvn axis is precisely that which Mr. Hopkins, when he stands still, is performing round the axis of the earth. Like the moon, that scientific gentleman's body presents the sanme part of it always to the earth's centre, and all sides of lhimself in succession to the sun; and we are all of us, according to Isis definition, rotating each round his own axis. Now, if Mr. Hopkins is not too much horrified at tIle idea, miU he be so good as to spin himself round on his heel? However shockingly unscientific, it is stil physically possible to do so. Will he be kind enough to tell me what that additional motion is to be called? " Axial rotation"I is already bespoken and appropriated to his former and lunar motion. There must be another name for another movement, so utterly and entirely distinct from the former one that either snay take place without the other. If any of your unscientific readers doubt this let them hold a ball firmly between, finger and thumb. By turning the body round, with the baU at arm's length, it will perform what I used to consider, in my Cambridge days, revolution round a distant centre, and it will present the same side, just as the moon does, towards that centre. This is one motion. Now, turn the baU roiund with the finger and thumb, aind however slowly this is done it will present a change of face to the holder. Nor will this latter movement be anywise affected by stopping the revolution of the arm. But if this movement of the ball be as I humbly submit-" axial rotation"-its former revolution caunot be; neither can it be properly so called, for distinct motions must have distinct names. If the astronomers are right in saying that the moon presents the same face to us because she rotates on her own axis once in the same time that she revolves round the earth, let us also teach that the reason whv each part of the felloe of a wheel presents its face to the box at the centre is because such parts rotate on their axes in the sanle tinme that they revolve round the box; and the same reason will apply likewise to every nail in the tire, just as much as to the moon. If, as Mr. Hopkins implies, the difference between us is one of terms, it is high time that astronomers should adapt and apply tsemi with that precision and clearness which science demands. If this controversy has no other result, I shall heartily rejoice at the humble part I have taken in it. It has aroused a spirit of instructive and earnest inquiry such as no trivial or settled point could possibly have sustained; and I asn in doubt whether I ow-e more, in the maintenance of my grotuld, to the aid of my adherents or the abuse of my opponents. WVith renewed tisanks for your courtesy to mysed, - I am, Sir, your very obedient servant. JELINGER SYMONS. .px-- L 1^.

LOCA CeHARGES UPON SHIPPING. The Seleet Committee, consisting of Mr. Beamish, Mr. Bouverro, r. CardveU, Mr. Co'oden, Sir J. Duckworth, Mr. DsIcan, Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Milner Gibson, M1r. Hardy, Mr. Ieadlam, Mr. Eorsfa;ll, Mr Lowe, Lord Hotham, Mr. fatt, Sir W. llcathcote, MIr. Vance, and IMr. Watson, mnet onlriday in Room No. U1; Mr. Lowe in the chair. The CILURVA.r said a petition from certain inhabitants of Runcorn had becn presented to the Board of Trade, complaining of the dues levied by the corporation of Liverpool, and the petition had been referred to this comrnittee for con sideration, and he proposed that it be read by the derk. Mr. HoRsrFALL moved that the room be cleared while the committee deliberated upon the suibject. Strangers were accordingly ordered to withdraw, and after a delay of more than an hour the public vwere re-admitted, when the petition was read by the clerk. Mr. Heron, town clerk of Manchester, was then examinea, and said the question of the town dues of Liverpool caused great interest at Manchester in consequence of what had taken place before the commissioners appointed to inguire i.ntg the subject a fev- years back. Before that inquiry it had been imagined that trade and commerce had benefited to a considerable extent by the e gpenditure of the tovn dues, but it wlasfound the corporation of Liverpol denied the re.sponsibility of expedinganything upon trade and commerce; and their conduct wras such as to sustain the position they had taken,very little having been expended for that purpose. It was a subject of deep importance, not only to Manchester and Liverpool, but also to commerce gencrally, as nearly half the trade of this country found its way to Liverpool. He would lay before the committee a few facts and figures in support of this statement. In 1700 the population of Liverpool was 5,714; in 1831 it was 165,000; and it now reached nearly 350,000. In 1753 the dock dues amounted to 2,0341. lGs. 2d., in 1803, to 28,0271. 13s. 7d.; in 1833, to 182,9S01. ls. 4d.; in 1851, to 235,5271. 2s. 6d.- and it was stated in evidence last session that the dues at that time amounted to nearly 380,0001. The Liverpool town dues in 1731 were 6481. 16s. 3d.; in 1811, 19,7281. 3s. 5d.; in 1833, 47,0071. 14s. 2d. - in 1847, nearly 100,0001. ; and in 1855 nearly 150,0007., of which latter sum 125,0001. found its wvay into the coffers of t3:e corporation, and the remainder was returned to the freenlen of Liverpool. The practice was that all goods paid the dues, and the freemen claimed to have the amount paid by them returned. The total amount received from dock and towvn dues would therefore be 530,0001. per annum at present, and in the course of a year or twvo, in consequence of the imnprove}ments IIow goingonat Birkenhead andlivernoolDocks, the smn to be raised upon the comMerce of the Mersey might be put at 650,0001. per annum. The nature of the title of the Liverpool corporation to levy these dues might be shortly stated from the answers given to the Shipping Dues Commissioners in 1S54 by the corporation of Liverpool. In 1628 Charles I. conveyed the |manor of Liverpool to the corporation of London for 7001., v%rho afterwards sold the lease to Lord Molyneux, whose famDily made it over to the corporation of Liverpool on the 27th of Mfay 1672. In 1691 some litigation was commenced by the freemten of London (being also freemen of Liverpool), who denied the right of the corpoation to levy the tolls, and in 1695 the corporation seized certain teas for the town dues alleged to be payable, and in consequence a bill was filed by Samuel Hall and other freemen of Liver. pool against the corporation. The cause was heard on the 2d of July, 1697, before the Barons of the Exchequer, and the result was that the freemen of London were declared exempt from the town dues of Liverpooh. In 18S3 an association of Liverpool merchants was formed for the purpose of having the dues lehied in a more equal manner, and their efforts were so far successful that a large reduction was made from particular charges which were found to be most oppressqve, and which they them. selves broughtb nore especially under the notice of thetowncouincil. Mr. Heron then read a list of the town dues, and said the corporation claimed to levy them over the whole area of the Customs port of LiverpooL This was established in 1680. The dues were levied upon every article that came into or went out of the port of Liverpool, as stated by the report of the Commissioners, printed by order of the House of Commons on the 30th of May, iSPo. It also reported that the dues were levied not according to any fixed scale, but at the discretion of the common council, and upon memorials from the merchants, or from other motives, these dues were sometimes reduced or varied. A brass plate was once fixed on the Custom-house, specifyingthe dues on some articles; but it disappeared in 1803, and since that period there had not been any official tariff for the collection of the town dues. Lists were printed from tune to time, and found their way into the " Directories," but on an application being made about six months since at the Custom-house for an authorized copy of the tariff, the parties were told that the officers had no such thing, and did not know where it could be obtained. There was the greatest possible difficulty and uncertaintyin ascertaining whatthe dues reallywere, and a gentleman was prepared to state to the comumittee that an immense amount of ton-u dues were collected vithout any tariff or printed circular, and were left to the discretion of the clerks who received them, who frequently differed from eachother ; and this uncertainty also offered a temptationto pilfering on the part of the clerks and collectors. It was perfectly clear there was nothing to guide thein, and each obtained what he could from the merchants. In reply to the Cmurnir_A?, witness said these dues were levied upon the necessaries of life as well as merchandise, and read a return obtained from Mr. R. Procter, a corn broker of Liverpool, showing the imports and exports of grain, &c., from October, 1852, to Jumie, 1853. He also read the amounts paid by several firms in Liverpool for town dues, and contrasted the position of the freemen and nonfreemen in this respect. Witness continued.-It had been imagined that the town dues were applied for the benefit of the shipping of the port of Livelpool; but this was not the fact, as only a very inconsiderable amount was thus e- pended; thelarger part went to w,iden the streets and otherwise improve the town. By the statemient of the Town Clerk of Liverpool before the Commissioners in 1833 it appeared that a large portion of the poor-rates were paid out of them. The total amount of poor-rate was 60,0001., and towards this betxveen 5.0001. and 6,0O1. was paid out of the town dues by the Corporation. Mr. Bramley 3Moore's evidence went to show that the total amount of town dues at one period was 91,0001., and the comulcil did notliing for the docks or the dock estate out of this money, but it was appropriated entirely to the borough. He further said, in another portion of his evidence, the ordinary receipts were lG7,1541. 13s. 34d., of which the towvn dues form 115,3561. ls. lld. Thie only items out of this sum which could be said directly or indirectly to be applicable or beneficial to trade, commerce, and shipping amounted to 4,7701.; and, referring to the years 1849 and 183, the amount w as nearly the same. After some further evidence as to the borough rates, &c., The Committee adjourned until Monday at 1 o'clock.
THE CORPORATo ON OF LONDON AND THE FISH SALESM1EN OF BILLINGSGALTE.-TO the catalogue of grievances against the Corporation of the city of London another very crying one is now added. We have just received a communication from the fish salesmen of Billingsgate mlarket, together wvith the copy of a petition presented by them to the House of Coninions on Fi-iday night. It hence appears that, from the reign of Queen Blizabeth downwards, the wholesale market at Billingsgate has been declared by the Legislature to be a free and open one for ties standing, buying, aed seUing of fish, subject to tols on the boats, vessels, and conveyances bringing fish thereto. The act 9th and 10th of Victoria, chap. 346, consolidated aU the existing acts in one general act, and conferred the control, maintenance, and regulation of the market on the Lord Mlayor, commonalty, and citizens of the city of London, by Avhom the several tolls payable by the salesmen and others were to be received and applied to the maintenaniee and improvement of the market and the payment of salaries and other expenses. Yet, although these tolls are (as the petitioners allege) amply sufficient for the purposes referred to, the corporation have recently imposed an " arbitrary and illegal tax" upon the sale of fish-food in Billingsgate in the shape of a heavy renteharge on the salesmen, in addition to thie daily tols, to which alone they are entitled by the act. The charge (about 3,0001. a-year) was at first resisted by the salesmen, but early in December, IM55, the corporation advertised that they would forthwitlh let the standings; and the salesmen, to avoid expulsion from the market and the consequent ruin of their trade, were obliged to submit to the extortion. The petitioners also complain of the great inconvenience which they have already experienced from the carrying out of the corporation " improvements," inasmuch as they have been displaced from their stands inthe interim. The alterations and improvements include an Italian colonnade for the use of the city officers, an illuininated clock (which is hardly visible from the market) ; a subterranean market for the sale of shellfish, so iuhealthy as to be a perfect nuisance; a corrugated iron roof, which reflects so much heat in summer as seriously to damage the fish exposed for sale; an useless warehouse over the north side of the m.arket (not applied or applicable to nsarket purposes); and a fountaini, rather a source of annoyance than othervise to the petitioners. On these grounds the petitioners pray the House of Commons to introduce a clause into the Newv Corporation Refonn Bill, preserving the wholeale fish-mariket at Bihingsgate free for the use of the fishermen and the trade frequenting the same, and obliging the corporation to fulfil the trusts reposed in them by the act of Parhiaent. TESTIMONIAL TO A CERnGY i5AN.-IJ St week, tlle congregation of Verulam Episcopal Chapel, Lambeth, presented a purse contaiLing 100 sovereigns, vith an appropriate testimomal, to the Rev. Henry Christmas, in order to mark their esteem for him, and also to evince their regret at the termination of his ministry at that place of worship. [Advertisement.-jolin Cassell and the Educational Qucstion.-Itis very evidert that the House of Commons cannot ogrc as to the principle upon which a system of State education shoauld h based, neither has it bece decided whether it isconsistent wbils tbe institutions of a free country for the State to undertake any system e f education, especially by compulsory measures; and, still further, it has notbeen shovn that the plass proposed are the most economica!, -r the most efficient. It has, however, been pretty correctly estimated that to carry ouit the resolutions proposed by Lord John Russell vould entail upon the people a ratiog at least equal to that of the noor-rate anid county-rato, the estimated amount required bein-i;,6 eto,*o per annum. And, after all, the suiccess of the proposed shemne is. in the opinion of those who are most competent to judge, very problematical. But wlhile the question of SaLte education remains thus unsettled tle cause osf educa1tion itself is advancmng-. John Cassehl, withoutsolidting the aid of Government or even tie voluntary contributions of tho benevolent, proposes to place within the reach of the humblest individuals, and those *vhose educationi bas been neglected, the means of self-instruction and self-culture. With this view he Wiml commence the issue, in weekly numbers, Vd. each, of au entirely new educaltional work, under the title of " John Cassel's Educational Comuse",o. 1 to be ready Saturday, May 10. The plan which John Casell hmas marked out includes--lst, the production of an e(lucational course unparaUeled for cheapness, each weekly number to contain 32 pagcs, demy octavo; 2, the publication of each branch scparate aud distinct, so as to forns complete vorks at the conclusnonof toe course. Persons of lmited income will thus be able, for a few shillings, subibed by l5d. weekly, to possess a useful cducational library *, the rcndering of education attractive. The first monthly Part, which wisl be realy May 31, price 7d.. will create in all who purchase and study its raes beth surprse and pleasure-surprise at the great extent of scientific knowledge that may be obtained with comparatively little effort, and pleasure at finding in hiot- very interesting and Popular 2 manner knowledge may be eoumnunicated. The course will commencc with "Science pnopularly explained," cumbracing 4,01)0 questions on various trs,,8n ches of sci ence, with pla in stid intelligibl9 an swers. Parents, hends Of p,bol2s. and all enagged fn ehe instruction of youth are earnest2y request'ed to obtain the first monthly part of, John Cassell's ECducational Cu *'use" as a Spettimen. The wocrk. will, no doubt, be receised with f.avouss by all classess of the conmmlnitya. and its study wrill cer-. tainly prove )migbly a-dvantageous.
