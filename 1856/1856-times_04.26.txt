TI COR21fBAN ROARD OF INQUIRY. ThIs Board re-assembled yesterday at Chelsea Hospital. The attendasice, althouglh very numerous, was perhaps somewhat smaller than on some formier occasions, and among the more distinguished auditors at the upper end of the hl]i was comprised a large proportion of ladies. i :Upon the muembers of the Board taking their seats, l The Earl of Lucan reminded the Court that on a former day he had proposed to read a letter from Adwiral Sir D. Dundas, containing replies to certain queries which he (Lord- Lucan) had submitted to that gallant officer, whom a domestic misfortune prevented from personal attendawnce. fWould thle Board allow the letter to be rend? The Board intimated, througlh the JUDGE-ADVOCATF, that they were of opinion that at present the letter could not be received in evidence; but if, hereafter, they should think it necessary to admit further evidence, it would be open to themi to consider whether, in Sir 1). D_nd3s's * absence, the letter alluded to could be taken. Colorel Tclloch begged permuission to hand in an iun portant letter, which he had only been able to find since Saturday last. TheBoard would remember that Generat Sir IL Airey had been asked-* Did not the comumissioners give you the opportunity of doing this in writin 0> and by a four days' examination of your senior assistant r' to which he replied-" 3My own examination was in writing, and, as I have already stated, mine were verygeneral and superficial answers to general questions. I had no notion of the leaning of the commis-ioners and of theirintention to implicate any one. If I had thought there was the slightest blame imputed I should have gone more fully into the matter, and I think I should have been able to explain things perfectly, andl cannot help thinking the commissioners tbemselves would have come to a differen t conclusion." In reply to that observation he (Colonel Tulloch) would hand in an ofnicial letter from Colonel Gordon, as Deputy QuartermasterGeneral, dated Junie the 4th, 1S55, in which, after explaining the delay wvbich had occurred in returning the statement of hisc-idencesentto binlbythle comimjissioners for revia`oz, he weent on to say he w as directcd by General Airey to state that as the queries addressed to hins wexe 52 in nunm. ber, nearly every one of wlhich conitained au implied accuration of neglect or carelessness, he begged todecline answering themi in an offhand manner, but would examine tach question, and would prepare his replies as soon as the duties of his department would permiit bins to do so. The PEsrDE.NXr asked Colonel Gordon if he had written that letter. Colonel Gordon replied in the affirmative, and the letter was handed in to the Board. * Colonel Tulloch said he had also a letter fron Dr. Farr,jthe head of the Statistical Department of Somuerset-house, in which that gentlemuan approved the correctness of the metlhod upon wvhich the commissioners had calculated the loss of horses in the Cavalry Division. The JnDGE-ADvociTs 'was of opinion the letter could 20t be received as evidence at present. - Colonel Tulloch then proceeded to address the Board in defence of the commissioners' report. Before proceeding to comment upon the evidence which had been adduced in the course of the inqluiry, he must, ho said, advert to the very difficult position in wvhich he wasplaced in having tosupport by evidence takeni in England the correctness of conclusions arrived at by Sir J 5'Neill and himself from evidence taken in the Crimac. No instance probably had ever before occurred of any person appearing before a public Court under such disadvantages, and had he not felt it to be a hounden public duty to maintain the correctness of the report, nothing, even self-defence, would have induced him to undertake suclh a task. Had the present inquiry been conducted in the Crimea, witnesses mighlt have been found uat every step-not a slipmaster but could have borne testimocy to the possibility of procuring a supply of sailcloth and to the facility of obtaining carpenters or seamen frons their vessels. Such witnesses, kowever, could not be obtained in this country, and the only civilians whom he had been able to prodace were fr. Bracebridge and 31r. Rawlinson, whose evidence there were hundreds in the Crimea to corroborate. Had the inquiry been conducted in the Crimea. he would have been enabled to exansinle any military witnesses whom he might think necessary, ina-tead of being restricted to a few commanding officers previously exauined at Balaklava, fronm whom affirmative testimony could only be obtained at the risk of exposino theni to the charge of dereliction of duty in not having oflicially suggested the precattions wlhich their evidence showed -they beheved to be nece-ssary. Another, and not tl:e least difficulty consequent upon the investigation being carried on in this country was the absence of returns to show the employment of the cavalry during the period at -which no shelter for the horses was provided. In the .Crimea the commissioners had the daily " states" to guide them, but when these states were directed to be excluded from the report-the details of regimental duty not being a matter for the commnissioners to inquire into-they were destroyed. Had the present inquiry been carried on in the Crimca there wvould have been no difficulty in ascertaining the employmnent of ever soldier end every horse on each prtctilar day. He (Colonel Tulloch) had, however, only the choice of two evils-either to expose himself to all these disadvantages, or to leave the report at the mercy of those who were inclined not merely to challenge its conclusions, but to question its returns and to distort its facts. Had the accuracy of the conclusions in the report alone been attacked, he would have considered the report in safety under the consideration of the Board; but the opening address of Lord Lucan seemed to indicate a plan of operations which rendered quiescence on his (Colonel Tuoch's) part impossible. Had the assertions of Lord Lucan remained unanswered, Lord Cardigan would have adopted a similar course, and all sorts of inaccuracies in the returns would have been alleged. The Quartermaster-General and the Deputy-Quartermaster-Ge. neral would have done the same, and the few remains of the report would then have left but a scanty mne.l for Mr.Filder to discuss. He therefore had no alternative but to appear in person, and he had done so under a strong conviction of the hardship of the course thus rendered necessary and of the disadvantages to which it exposed him. It vas not necessary to make any further reference to the made in -which the evidence was taken, or the returns upon which it was founded, except to regret that the commissioners had not been attended by a shorthand writer, who could have recorded the evidence more fully than had been done. In that report there was no animadversion, and in its support all that he had to do was to hand in to the Board the signed evidence of the witnesses examined and the signed returns which had been furnished, leaving theBoard to decide upon the credibility of the first and the accuracy of the latter. -He begged to be allowed to repeat that in all steps which be had taken upon this occasion he was acting for himself alone, and nothing that he might do in any way affected his absent colleague, who, not being a ni;litary man, was in the same position as himself. It was not the least of the difficulties of his position that military officers could not readily comprehend the guarded terms in whichl persons employed to rmake reports to the Government were obliged to express themselves, being accustomed in the army to find specific charges against perons made whenever there was reason to believe there had been any dereliction of duty, and therefore could not see why persons suspected of incompetency should not be pointed out at once and by name. But before public cormmissioners could tak-e such a step they must be invested with full power to inivestigate the condutet of every officer of every department wrhom they mightconsider to be - implicated, and possibly would have to extend their in- quiries into the whole conduct of the nar itself. Caution - in these matters might not be so necessary in respect to departments wbich have or seem to have independent action, such as the comomissariat or the medical department; but writh respect to the other administrative - or executive branches of the army, whose duties approxi- mate so closely that it is hard to say where the responsibility of the one ends or that of the other commences, it could be easily conceived what difficulties any expression of the commissioners that blame attached to individuals would - involve the Government, especially if there was an implied obligation to place before the public the result of the investigation of the commissioners. The inquiries would, ho-ever, bave been of little use had the cosnmmissioners abstained from all indications which might turn the attention of the Government in that direction where something apparently was wrong. The commissioners felt that more was required than a miere record of the sufferings of the army, and remedies could, of course, never hav_ been suggested nor applied unless some remote indication was given of the qu-arter in wvhich the existing arrangements had proved defective. With these considerations in view the Board wou;ld not be surprised that the commissioners acted with caution in their report, and would also be satisfied tnat no animadversions were cast by the report upon any one; but that it contained simply an expression of opinion that something had been wrong, leaving it to the Government to determine who were the yarties responsible, or to make any further inquiries which At might deem to be necear. f he were asked why the commissioners - posed anything to be wrong in the cavalry departsunenr,he could only say nothing could be worse than their condition. The commissoners arrived in the Crimea about the middle of 3tarcb, at vhich period the wvinter might be supposed to be almost over. The harbour was then crowded with vesseLs, with huts, and building stores; some had been lying there for morths at an enormous cost to the public. When the comnmissioners wenttoKadikoithey found a considerable number of thecavalrystill undertents, andthegroundstrewn with the half buried carcasses of the cavalry horses. The commissioners found, upon inquiry, that stabling was only erected for the horses about the middle or the end of February, although it appeared from the QuartermasterGenerel's book that an order was given to that effect lon" before, in Novemnber. The Quartermaster-General in his evidence made no statement about want of tools, of materias, of Turks, or of an engineer officer, althongh he Prosduced the order given in November to the cavalry division to prepare shelter for the horses. The gallant o glonel referred to portions of Sir IR. Airey's evidence wpon this subjact, in which that officer explained his Dsission to mention the impediments to the execution p 4!:ze order to pro-ide shelter bjstting that Ile was unazwme that the commLissioners intended to cast blame upon any cr;e, and therefore he gave his answers to their ques-tions as rapidly and as succinctly as possible. Colonel rul- loch thes proceeded to remark upon this statement that it -was inconrltent with the letter he had that morning pro- nced, signed by Colonel Gordon, stating Sir E. Airey's disinclination to answer offhad so many questions of such iaeL-led nature, and conveying imputations of neglect anid * carSelksness. Sir R. Airey, also, must explain how it - was -he omiapd to give the commisWonWS that infonnationi as to the car.sez. why shelter had not beep provided for the horses is. cowpbisnct with i]Jk u SIw givei P' hAim, in tG k tbsenc6 of wAhich in!ear.nat:ion tle coiumissioners were justified ia asuming there had been a " want of ingenuity or protnpti- - tude" soiucwherc. The Board would see that General Airey h:d taken credit to his department for havinl issued the order in due time, but he left the eavalry to-bear the onus of not having complied with it. He (Colonel Tullochl) would nc-t make any cominnent upon General Airey'ss wiihholting of those facts upon a subject respecting -whicl the commissioners felt the greatest anxiety, and a knowledge of which would have relicved them fromn the painful chargcof making important statements vithout' dunenquiry. It now appeared that the cotimsmiioners did all that could be expected from th.emto obtain fu!l information even to the extent of puttingtheir questions in writing which necessarily induced care and circunispection in the answ'ers. The wvhole quection between the comnmssioners and 'vhoever mightbeheldaccountablefoi "want of promptitude and ingenuity" resolved itself into onb query-" Did the military authorities know from the rniddle of November the difficulties in wvhich they were likely to be placed from want I of shelter for the cavalry T" Week after week passed, and ytt the shelter wvas not provided; the severity of winter was f;at setting in, a.d a vmst number of horses were dying daily. Undersuchlcircun.stances itwasnaturalto inquirewvhat, facilities could be given for getting the cavalry horstrs under slielter. Tiuber was.L e-xpected, but it was doubtful whether those vho ha.d so little time to spa:e could use suich heavy inaterials without a delay which would render them coinpletely useless. Lord Lucan had expressed his belief that all the horses were under shelter about the middle of! February, but how had that been accouiplisbed? Only because oue half of the horseshad died in the interim. Hai theproportion survived which might have been expected to have lived under ordinary circumlstances the whole of the horses couild not have been placed iunder shelter until the middle of MIarch, by wvhich time the w.-hiter would have passed away. In the circumstances in which the army was placed it was5 necessary that the measures for providing shelter for horses should not he delayed until the arrival of tim.2ber for permanent stabling: and of course the less the soldiers could do for thoumsel'es the greater the necessity of seeking for aud ob'aining such materials as were lUost readiy applicable for such purposes, without reference to expense. The testiniony of witnesses had been almost unanimous in favour of the commissioners' suggestion of sailcloth properly applied. as the best ixicans of meeting such an emergency. The gallant Colonel referred to the evidence of Major Thommmpson, Colonels Grifiths, Doherty. Low, and Douglas, Mr. Rawlinson,'and' Mr.. Bracebridge, in favour of saileloth, and remarked that! even Sir R. Aircy hdd admitted its aclvantage as a temporary shelter, provided the materials bad been on the spot. It w;as because the commissioners, backed by all that evidence, had felt it their duty to poiut out that there had' been a wvant of promptitude and ingenuity in devising some temporary shelter for the cavalry horses that their repoirt had been so rudely assailed. Lord Lucan appeared to approve' only of wooden stabling; butthe comunmissioncrs,whose opinion had been endorsed by many officers, thought that sorue other temporary shelter could have been provided. Surprisedas he (Colonel I'ulloch) was at Adrsraltyons's statement of the apparent destitution of the Bleet in respect to sailcloth, lie requested the Board to suspend its judgmuent until the return should be produced which he had soggested, to show the reserve supplies of sails on board each ship of war lring in the h.arbomirs of lKazatch and Balaklava or the vicinity in March, 1855. If those ieturns could not be procured otherwise, he hoped some member would be found in Parliament to move for their production. In the meantime he would call the attention of the Board to the fact that saileloth was never asked for either of Lord Raglan or of the Admiral, and it might be assumed that no attempt was made to procure it upon any extensive scale at Balaklava beyond the collection of some old sails by Captain Heath, and which were so much in deiiiand that the whole store was exhausted before reaching the cavalry encamp ment. Sir B. Lyons had stated that the suits of spare sails were requisite for the safety of the ships, to replace those which were liable at any moment to be split by a gale of wind; but it did not follo-w that upon such a coast at such a season the studding sails and other light sails only used in the calmest weather could not have been spared. But it was not necessary to go to the fleet at all, nor did the cavalry horses amount, as had been stated, to 2,000, but rather to one half thatnurmber, having been reduced by deaths to little more than 1,000. Evenif nothing could have been got froim the ileet, why could not an officer have been sent to Constantinople to purchase canvass 5 20,000 yards would have sufficed, or one-half that quantity if the ground had beenm previously scarped to the depth of three feet. That quantity migfht have beemi obtained within a week, and it was absurd to suppose that in a city built of woodand containing 800,000 inhabitants, there would have been anv difficuilty iu procuring carpenters or workmen capable of running up temporary framsework for canvass stabling. Sir E. Lyons had, however, borne testimony to the value of the slhelter which might have been obtainea by throwing up an embankment to protect the animals from the eftects of the biting wind-a p]an which might have been more exctensively used, and with simn?ar results as in the cases Of General Brown and Captain Wood, to whom SirE. Lyons had referTed. Captain Heath's undertaking to build stables for 300 mules by the aid of seamen and the resources of the fleet was another instance of what could be done. Upon this subject he would refer to Sir P . Airey's observations in respect to the offer made by some captains of transports to lend their crews to assist in erecting stables, that it might have been prompted by a desire to keep their ships snugly at anchor in F-ort during bad wcather and at heavy demurrage. It was, oewever, well known to all that there were many ships lying at Balaklava harbour which were used only as stores, and others laden with huts which could .ot be unladen for months, owing to the difficulty of conveying the huts to thme front, and the crews of those ships might have been made available for the construction of temporary stabling bygholding out a proper inducement to them. Vhen such means were neglected, the commissioners could not avoid the conclusion that there had been "a awant of promptitute and ingenuity," although I they never attributed it to the cavalry. Considering the possibility of obtaining carpenters or handicraftsmen, he did not, however, think the cavalry were so incoumpetent to help themselves as some supposed. The horses were decreasi;g in a larger proportion than the men, and even if it wvere true that the men could do but little, the greater was the necessity of using saileloth, as involving less labour and less carriage than timber. The numiber of men of the cavalry division in December and January, excluding sick, officers' servants, and detached parties, was 1,400, and none of the nmllitary witnesses had pointed out how theywere all engaged so that none were available for the important duty of providing shelter for their horses; and he wihed to remind the Board how studiously that point had been avoided by the witnesses when lie had endeavoured to show that the means at Lord Lucan's disposal wvere not so limited as they had been represented to be. In quitting that topic he would only add that if the inference were drawn that there had been no want of promptitude or ingenuity on the part of any departnment in not turning thelabour of the cavalry soldlier to account, such conclusion must involve another that many hiundreds of cavalry soldiers had been labouring for six weeks from November to Januiary without producin - any valuable result in the shape of teuiporary shelter, and that wimen upon a liberal calculation one man could in a week provide a shelder for his horse. In considering the amount of labour which the cavalry possessed it niust be remembered thlat they had no trench duties, their sickness w.-as less than that of the infantry in front, their mortality not one-half, and they were not exposed to harassing journeys between Bal-.- klava and the front as the infantry soldiers were. If the duties of a cavalry soldier were such as to render it an extraordinary circunistance for hins to do anything to shelter himself or lis horse, the necessity for assistance should have been foreseen much earlier, and the omission to provide some shelter could not be regarded otherwise than as "a want of promptitude and ingenuity." Referring next to tlhi part of the report relating to Colonel Grffts's evidence, Colonel Tulloch observed that Lord Lucan had now ample opportunity of ascertaining whether the statements of the commissioners were consistent with the evidence of that officer. The commissioners held themselves in no way accountable for its accuracy, they only gave the facts as told to them; but it was fair to state that Colonel Griffiths had not given that evidence voluntarily, but in answer to repeated questions which were put to him. After that evidence the Board could not biut consider the commissioners were fuUy justified in the assertion they made in the report respecting it. They did believe the suggestion to provide shelter was received in a manner which was likely to deter any othser officer from repeating it. Lord Lucan, in his opening address, had accused the commissioners of malignity towards the cavalry, but lad since witlhdrawn that accusation. He had also impugned thc accuracy of the returns quoted in the report, and asserted that no part of the Heavy Cavalry Brigade was in the Crimea on the lst of October-a statement which it was to be hoped he would also now withdraw. His Lordship had also attacked the mode of calculation by which the respective losses, of horses in the cavalry and the Commissariat were arrived at; and, in justification of his mode of calculation, he (Colonel Tulloch) had that morning handed in a letter from Dr. Farr, perfectly approvin, the umethod upon which he had proceeded, and wvhicei was the least unfavourable to the cavalry. The returns quoted in the appendix were also said to be incorrect, but the only evidence to support that allegation was that of Major Connolly; and it was not usual to set aside a report deliberately drawn up and signed by a superior officer upon the mere allegation of incorrectness by a junior officer. Even, howvever, if those returns w ere incor- rect, it was not the falt of the commioners, uho apphed for them to the proper officers, and, having obtainedtliem, were bound to accept them as correct. With regard to that part of the report where it was stated that the conumissioners considered it strange that more rapid progress was not made in obtaining the advantage of hut accommodation for the men Lord Lucan bad explained that he could not get huts earlier than the end of January or begnning of February, and, as General Airey 3made the admission that he thought it probable that huts could inot be given because they were wanted for the men in front, it would appear that this part of the delay might not have been the fault of the cavalry ; but the fact of the hats beingwanted for the men in front afforded no satisfactory explanation for refusing them to Lord Lucan, as it would be seen by reference to the dates of tlleir arrival from England, and of the sailing of the vessels after they were unladen, that four of these vessels, which arrived in the end of Dedember or beginning of January, were from 46 to 70 days in the harbour, and that the greater part of those which arrived in December and the early part of January were stil there unladen in Febrnary. To whatever cause, therefore, the refusal might be attributable, it certainly could not have been the wan;t of htts, and, though the cavalry might be acquitted of all blame for the delay, that acquittal must necessarily mplicate some otber department, and afforded an additional proof of the necessity on the part of the coinmlissioners for indicating 'hat they conceived to have been wrong, instead of determining who was to be responsible for it. The last, though not the least, ofLord Lucan'sobjections referred to the conimissioners havin"-exceededtheirinstructions, which he supoosed to extend only to commissariat matters. He (ColonelTulloch) could but attribute .Iis LordEhip's error to the circumstance of his having, perhaps, merely perused the first letter of instrnctions, and notboing aware that the second, written a couple ddysafterwards, wa.s intended to g7ive the coni- missioners moregeneral andsanple ciwer of inquiring into the delay in the distribution oF al. the stores, which bid begun to attract public attentiohi* at homne. Any quest-on, hosever, on this head, muest, he submiited, -be colupletely set at rest by the approval expressed by the head of REr ajesty'sGovermnmet of the conduct of - the commissioners throughout those investigations. Some parts of the report originallymadeto the Secretary for Warhavingbeen excluded fronm that laid before Patliament, on the ground thtthe comnmnissioners had no authority for going ito the points there referred to, it followed as a natural inference that the Government had satisfied themselves that the remaining portions came within the scope of their instructions. Eor his Ont Part, he could assure theBoard thit could he honourably have ' interpreted-their instructions in thbt restricted serse he would nost gladly have done so, as he was weU aware that it would have saved them the pain of being brought into antagonism with several departments instead of one only. In every indication as to-whereblAine arpeared to rest the commissioners endeavoured to frame it in the most guarded manner. This precaution, however, he -was sorry to find, had raised up enemnies in variouis quarters, when a more decided opinion would, perhaps, have involved the hostility of one only. Bnt for that there was no remnedy. It was one of the painful consequences in which the honest discharge of duty to. the Government and the country bad involved him. Cares and toils, injuistice and ill-will, form, as had been truly said, a part of the burden that nmust be borne by every manu who served the State. UTpon the gallant Colonel concluding his address he was greeted by a burst of applause, which was, however, immediately suppressed by the officers in attendance. The JUDaE-ADVOCATE inquired of Lord Lucan whether he was prepared to proceed with his reply. Lord lucan said lie would ask the Board to allow him until Monday, as he desired to have an opportunity of read-, ing over Colonel Tulloch's observations before replying to them.: The JUDGE-ADVOCATE, on the part of the Board, refretted the delay which an adjounmment would occasion, bnt, as Lord Lucan requested it, they could not refuse to extend to him the indul-ence which they had granted to Colonel Tulloch. The Noard -would therefore hear Lord Lucan's address on Monday, and if that should be concluded sufficiently early they would proceed with the case of Lord Cardigan. The Board then adjourned until Monday.

Your obedient servant. GEORGE BOWYER. Temple, April 23. Temple, April 19. Dear Sir,-I find that while I happened to be out of the Rouse during your speech on the 3Maynooth grant you stated that Cardinal W'isernan had lately published two numbers of an old work in which the title of the descendants of the Rouse of Hanover was disputed, and in which the existence of the heirs of King James was asserted, and that such an opinion was inculcated among some portions of the Roman Catholic cbmmunity was confirmed by other publications. I should be very much obliged if you would let me know the title of the work to which you referred as published by his Eminence and the name of the pablisher. Believe me yours sincerely, GEORGE BOWYER. R. Spooner, Esq., LP. Birmingham, April 22. My dear Sir,-I was not aware till I got your letter yesday that I Ws reported to have said " Cardinal Wiseman had published two numbers of an old work,'? &-c.

The crime was perpetrated by Betsy Edge, a woman of o5, upon her sister, Ann Edge, wlho is 76. The two 'women lived in the house of a farmer named Becrisford. They went to bed together on Wednesday night in perfect amity, but about 5 oclock on Thursday morning Betsy Edge got up, and, having procured an axe, beat out the brains of her sleeping sister with it. Berrisford, hearing a noise, went to the room and secured the inifnriated woman just as sbe was about to inflict another blow upon her sister. The poor old woman diedin about anhour from the wounds wiich she had previously received. An inquest was appointed to beheld last nighit.

The noble lord reminded their lordships that on a former occasion he had presented a simlaar petition, hich wras signed by many of the directors of the Bank of England and of the East India Company, as well as by a large body of merchants, traders, solicitors, and barristers and which might he said to represent the secular as the present pition did the religions feelings of the city of London on this mportant question. The Bishop of OXFOEtD presented a petition against the bill for legalizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister from a parish in Hampshire. The Marquis of BREADALBANE presented petitions to the same effect from the Free Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, and the Free Presbytery of Ayr. The Earl. of WILTON presentedl a petition against the abolition of church-rates. Viscount LIFFORD presented petitions from Horsemonden, in Kent, against the abolition of church-rates; anfd from the same place against any change in the oath, of abjuration. Lord BROUJGHAM presented a petition from Halifax, Yorkshire, praying for such an amendment of tho law as ,would redress the grievances to which married women were at present subjected. The noble and learned lo::d expressed his cordial concurrenco with the prayer of the petition, and suggested that in actions for criminal conversation notice of the action should be given to the plaintiff's wife, who sbould be pennitted to attend and defend herself. SECONDl)ARY P13UISHMENTS. Earl STANHOPE observed, that it was his intention to postpone for the present the motion of which he had given notice for the appointment of a committee on the subject of secondary punishments. (Hear, hear.) He was induced to take this course in consequence of representations made to him by members of the Government, who thought it desirable that no further movement should be miade on the question of secondary punishmrents until the committee now sitting on an analogous subject had presented their report. - The Marquis of L ANSDOWNE said, he was desirous of stating that the Governmnt had every desire to promote the object which the noble earl had in view-namely, that the proposed inquiry should be as effectual as possible; but, on communication: with the members of the other House wlho had taken charge there of this important inquiry, it was thought that it would be attended with some inconvenience if inquiries in both houses were started and commenced at the same time. At the same tine, he was quite sure that no duty was more inuembent on the House than to pursue with zeal an inquiry onthe subject, wvith the view to obtain an effectual remedyfor the evils complained of. He was anxious to say that he was not of opinion that the system now pursued by meaus of tickets of leave had been so long tried as to lead to anything like a convincing conclusion. Nsvertheless, without anticipating the result of the pending inquiries, he could not but state his own opinion thatitwasnotposbiblethata system of secondarypunishments could work well in this country without the auxiliary of transportation. (Hear.) He was not one of those who thought-that any one punishment or system could be exclhsively adopted, but he was sangnine enough to hope that the new svstem might prepare for restoration to societv 'persons who mi"ht afterwards be rendered valuable and useful to it. To oth the systems-of imprisonment for a term of years in this country, and of transportation for a term of ;rears in the colonies-the difficulty applied equaly of providing for -the transition state before the criminal could enter into society at large. He hoped both that and the other House of Parliament would Wkeep this great and inherent difficulty in view. He could not resist the temptation of saying, without asking the House to draw any conclusion from the statement, that in one part of the united kingdom a most important and, he hoped successful experiment was now being tried in Ireland, both in the city of Dublin and in the city of Cork, where criminals discharged from prison were subjected to individual supervision, which, up to the present time, though the experiment had not lasted long enough to afford confirnied experience on the subject, had proved eminently successfuL It was one of tthose experiuments which it was the duty of the Leogislaturo and the committees of inquiry to watch, as it had in view the preparation of the criminals for a return to society. Earl GREY thought, if there was to be an inquiry, that there ought not to be any delay in the appointment of the committee. There were one or two points on which legislation was urgently required, involving obvious improvements in the actof 1853, and which, if brought before a committee, would at once be recommended and carried during the present session. Seeing that Vhitsuntide was approaching, he was persuaded that delay would he fatal to legislation in the present year; and such a result he should regard as a great misfortune. Viscount DUNIGANNON hoped that this session would not be allowed to advance much further without some very decidedcourse being taken by their lordships' House with regard to this rapidly increasing eviL The subject then dropped. THE NAVAL REVIEW. Earl GRANVIILE said that since yesterday he had made inquiries into the causes of the mistakes of Wednesday, and he had now to state to their lordships what were the instructions given by the Admiralty for the safe conveyance of the two Houses of Parliament to and from the naval review. Some time ago arrangements were made with the SouthWestern Railway to carry their lordships down to South - ampton, and at the beginning of this week Captain ,tllne had had an interview with tne traffic manager to ascertain from him whether it was perfectly certain that the company could undertake under the pressure to which it was likelythey would be subjected to convey their lordships withoutany chance of a failure. Theanswerhereceived was, that the company had made such arrangements that it was absolutely certain that both the peers and the members of the other House would arrive at Southampton at a quarter past 9 o'clock, The Admiralty sent a communication tothe municipal authorities of Southampton, requesting them to take every precaution to keep a clear passage from the railway station to the place of embarcation, and they also wrote to the packet agenta person of great experience-desiring him to do everything in his power to facilitate the embarcation of the twvo Houses. Orders were also given to approPriate the Harbinger and the Pasha of Egypt yacht aS ternders to convey the two Houses on board their respective vessels, and the packet agent was directed to hire two additional tenders. He wrote back to say that it was perfectly -impossible for him to hire any vessels, and twvo other steamers were then sent round for the service. With regard to the selection of the Transit she was thought to be a very fine vessel, and, having a large maindeck, she afforded accommodation for a large number of persons to breakfast i0gether, with th,e additional advantage of being under cover in case of rough weather coming on. Inquiries had been made beforchand as to the state of her engines, and the answer Was that they were in good order with the exception * f a slight defect in the air pumps, the cnly effect of which .would be to reduce her speed from U to 10 knots an hour. The officer selected to commalld was a gentleman of coniderable experience, and their lordships had all been sitnessess of his great courtesy. (Hear, hear.) His instrucl ios wvere to be ready to receive the company at 9 o'clock, -nd having tak-en them on board he was to steam down the two lines, to wait for Her Majesty, and on her arrival to ktae up her station as near the Xofal yacht as possible. In case of any infore.wen delay he was io keep outside for fear tfcoming into collision with any of the gunboats, Wlhat .etter Istructions, even iudgirg after the eyent, could have been given tbihem there, he could not see. The Admiralty had sinice made inquiries as o. the state of the Trnsim s en"inesi and it Wias found that the only cause of their failure was that the steam had got low in consequence of the fires having been let 700 an W Theyonhaa ordered a stct and searchang inquir to.. Se.made as to who was to blame fowthis omtssion, and whot ever he was he whould to piethed. The rhsole thiur arose tfrom the u fortunate breakdown en the South-Wrssteth Railwa-an event not so very extraordimir sifer all considering that tre company had undertake7 to carry so large a nud ber of persons beyond their useal traffic. The atumulation of trains on the lIne tas so great that between theway, andS trsons arrived at the point of erm;tion at [ininagohn attwh vorysh omentrwhen the two Houses pere expected. At first the icket a fgent decined to ship them because he kishe so ieepf the tenders for the use of thed douses, but he was perfectly unabe to iesist tli I entreaties and remonstrances of 700 to SiO gentlemen and ladiesa,alerowdingandsqueezingtogethsrisitbedustandlheat. Hethought it better to use the tenders to get them out of the way, and that was the reason why they were anot forthcoming when their lordchips arrived.. With regard nia-he personal charge made against him, he was afraid he should not be able to make so satisfactoryn. answer. He had reeected deeply on the subject sinCe, and he could not think of any excuse for the wusillanimnty which he had displayed (Laughter.) He could not acceput tChe complimenet which bthe noble earl onpocite had paid him for eaoutenes and sagacity, for he had so completely losthis presence of mind that he only carried off with him one neutral peer and four noble lords of Her Majesty's Opposition. (L,aulghter.) -The Marquis of CLANWRICADB; wished to know w ho was to answer for what was done and vwhat was left undone by the railway company.a (HIear.) Ile ws afraid that Parliament at- present had no* power to punish theoffenders. but he hoped thatno long time would elapse before abill would be brought in, giving Parliament and the country supreme power over these railway companies. Lord R&VENSWORTH was villing to accept the noble ear's apology v,with respect to the arrangements, or rather the disarrangements o the early -part of the day; but the noble earl had given no explanation of the main grievancesiamely, the seven hours occupied by the Transit in her passage from the place where she had taken up her position oac t,Sonthampton. Earl GRANVILLE said, he imagined that his statement that the fire had gone out was a sulicient explanation of the absence of motive powver. (As laugh.) The Earl of GALLO WAY complained that the railway company had not taken the most ordinary precautions for the accommnodation of their lordships. The subject then dropped. MARRIAGE LAW A2IENDMENT BILL. The Rarlof St. GERMANS rose tomovethe secondreasling of this bill, and said that, although their lordships had in 1851 refused to affirm the principle of one of a,similar nature, he thought he was justified, after the lapse of five years, in asking them to reconsider that principle. In 1842 the other HlIouse had refused to allow a noble friend of his to bring in a bill on this subject, but since that time they had allowed such bills to be introduced. The Archbishop of Dublin had truly observed that every restrtction was an evil, and that the burden of proving its necessity must fail upon its advocates. He might therefore fairly call upon the opponents of this measure to show that the legalization of marriage with a deceased wife's sister would be inconsistent with the wellbeing of the country; but as the question had been frequently discussed, he might assume that nothing new could be. said npon it, and he would answer by antici. pation some of the arguments against the measure. Several able men held that the marriage law of the Jews was not binding upon Christians. That was the opinion of Bishop Taylo., who said:-.I "' For thlough Christendom was then at the time of the divorce of Queen Catherine by Henry VIIL, much divided, yet before there was almost a general consent upon this proposition, that the Levitical degrees do not by any law of God bind Christians to their observation. I knows of but one schoolman (Paludanus) who dissents. By all which it appears what was the state of these marriages under the law of Moses; and yet all the scruple at which weak persons start or stwnble is derived from that sanction in Leviticus which, in despite of all reason and all precedents, and all observations whatsoever, they -will needs suppose to be a natural and moral law, so making 11 Commandrnents, for certain it is that the Ten Commandments were to the Jews the sum of their moral law, in which, since some things that were ceremonial -were inserted, it is not likelv that anything that was moral should be omitted. In the 10 words of Moses there was nothing less thatu their whole moral law though something more there was." Chief Justice Vaughan took the same -view:-- " The levitical prohibitions are no general law, but particular to the Israelites. As they were delivered to the Jews only by Moses, they bind other nations no niore than other lawvs of the Jews do, as the laws of succession, aud inheriting land or goods. They theen must be made obligetive, if at all, to the generality of Christians by the New Testament; but by whatmedinm can that be provedc? 'Were it not for the statutes, it would be hard to make out by persons of what learning soever that we are obliged by the Leritical degrees, for we are not bound by the Judaical law, and how comes this part to be distinguished from the rest? I mean those of the Levitical degrees, which are of the Judaical positive law only." A more modern authority, Archbishop Whateley, in speak. ing of the opinion of another eminent prelate, also said -. "Iam certain that he (Bishop Copleston) in common wiith the very pei-sons vwho bave appealed to vwhat they call 'the divine law' in this matter, never considered the ceremonial or the civil regulations of the Levitical code as binding on us.XNo one considers himself bound by that to abstainfrom the forbidden meats, or from selling land in perpetuity, or to require any one to marry his brother's widow. Nay, even what are called moral duties no Christian Legis. lature has felt hound in all cases to enforce by its own laws disobedience to parents, for instance, and gluttony and drunkenness no one would deny to be moral offences, and yet no Legislature denounces against them the penalty of death. The whole, therefore, of the appeal to the Mosaic law is manifestly irrelevant, even on the showing of the very persons who have got up this topic of declamation for the purpose apparently * of. diverting attention from the real points at issue. The civil and the ceremonial ordinances of that law can thus far, and only thus far, be taken as a guide, namely, that anything which is not merely permitted, but distinctly enjoined in the law, cannot be at variance vwith the immutable principles of morality." Many learned men, Sir William Jones and others, held that the particular chapter in Leviticus, generally relied on by the opoonents of the bill, did not relate to marriage, but to unlawful intercourse. Let any unprejudiced man -who had never heard of the dispute upon this question refer to his Bible for information. Would he not tell their lordshipa that the only passage upon the subject was the lSsh of Leviticus, where a man was desired not to take a wife to her sister to vex her in her lifetime ? Attempts had been made to show that the words used in the authorized version did not truly express the words of the original ; but almost all the most eminent biblical authorities assmred us that the translation of this passage in the authorized version of the Bible was most accurate and correct, and that the Chaldee, the Samaritan, and all the ancient versions gave the same sense as the authorized version. There was nothing in the Bible to show that a man was not at liberty to do the same act at other times andin other places. There was a Divine instruction-" Ye shall not add to the Word that I comlmanad you." It appeared to him a perfectly umsound argument to say that, if marriage ;with a brother's widowv were prohibited, marriage with a deceased wife's sister ought not to be allowed, or that it ought to overthrow the permission contained in the 18th of Leviticus. Jeremy Taylor, in his Deciom' Dubita.ntiuas, said:-- " Bat if any scrupulous person shall enquire further, and suspect that some degrees or persons are forbidden to marry that are not here expressed, but included by a parity of reason, as- it happens in another instance, for it is not forbidden to marry our mother's brother's wife; but because here it is made unlawful to marry fathees brother's wife it is to be concluded also for the other, there being the same degree and the same reason. "I answer to this by parts. L It is very likely that it is so intended that in equal cases there is an equal prohibition; but it cannot certainly be concluded and relied upon that it is so. 1. Because upon this account cases of fear and scruple might very much be multiplied to no pur-. pose, for I remnember that Eages reckons out of the books of the Rlabbius 20 PerSOnS forbidden to marry, w hich yet are not reckoned in Leviticus. 2.- Because of the rule of the law. 'C. Mutes, 43 D. de procur quod lege prohibitoriz non vetitum eatpermissumintellgitur.' Innegativeprecepts that which is not forbidden is presumed to be allowed. And to addmore out of fear is either to be wiser than the lawgiver, or to suspect him to be apt to auarrel by unknown measures and secret rules of interpretation. 3. Because I find that among wise nations the same deg,reedoes not alwvays admit the same prohibition." Then it was said that there was a degree of consanguinity between a man and his wife's sister. On this subject Bishop !,ilner said: - "It is at this daya great question among ailmen whether brothers and sisters' children or cousinsgermanmaylawfullv marry? which question supposes not only that the Levitical degrees are still thought obligatory, but even all those other degrees which by a parity .of reason can be reduced to those measures.' On the w ords "near of kin" Jeremy Taylor said:- ' Our English is not sufficiently expressive of the full sense of it. Thc Latin is something nearer to the Hebrew. 'Mir non accedat ad propinquitatem carnis sue.' God never forbade tomarry ourkindred,but he forbade to marry the nearness of our flesh. Bemingius givesa rule for this as near as can be drawn from the words and the thing, 'Propinquitas carnis,' saith he, ' qune me sine intervallo attingit.' ahat is, 'She that is next to me, none intervening b'etween the stock and me.' That is, the propinquity or nearness of my flesh; above me is my mother. below me is my daughter, on the side is my sister-this is alL "in neg ative precepts that which is not forbidden is presumed to be allowed. "Unless God had intended these aperfect enumeration of ali the persons forbidden to contract marriges mutually, it cannotbeimagined why He should be pleased to repeat some degrees twice, which are: equally forbidden in the several instances; for if -the pafity of cognation were to be the measure, then those degrees which are twice repeated mig,ht without such repetition have been better reduced to the rule under which they wvere sufficiently prohibited. " The same degree does not always admlit the same prohibition; to marry my father's sister was forbidden, but it was not forbidden to marry my brother's daughster." A right rev. prelate who hadl made a speech on this subject which had been published in a pamphlet, had fallen into an unintentional error ina quotation from Jerem7y Taylor, whichhehad no donbthe would correct in anyfutureeedition. We could have no better definition of the words " nearness of kin," on which the opponents of this measure relied, than that given by God himself,;which gave no sanction to the existing prohibition. The words in her lifetime," in Leviticus, clearly spoke for themselves, for the injunction to a man not to do a certain thing at a particular tinme and place must be taken to imply a liberty to do it atadiflerent timeand place. N'o argument drawn fromanalogy could overcome that plain and unmni-sLkeable inference. Nobody pxetendedjlat our Lerd or any of his Apostles hadex- pressed any disapproval of these marriages; and the absenoe of any condemnation of them on the part of St. Paul was -especially significant, inasmuch as that inspired writer treated-very copiously of the subject of Tnarnage The case- of the illicit connexion between Rd and lierodias~whiele elicited the remnarkable reproof of Johnithe Baphsti~t was sonetinies referred to in arguing this que tion;but, on when impartially examined, it wouldbe fonud toiurnish nogrouadfor adherence to the present restriction.

The noble lord contended that the testmonof these authorities. fairly construed, ought. to saV4fr their lordships, and even the right rev, prelate to woIP, he had before alluded, that the case of Herod lerodins was wholly irrelevant to the Aiscnsmiop._ Under the Idosaic law it was enjoined that, when a naql, died without issue his brother should marry the- W40l0w. MIarr.iage with a deceased wife's sister was an'snalogois alliance, and might be sanctioned by a parity of reasonint. If the marriage witha deceased wife's sister were immoli that with a deceased brother's wife could screel be eiempted from, censure; yet the latter tolltre had the express authority of Scripture. It s not to be imaginiA, that the Almighty would have given his approvpl to apraptice which could under any possible combinaion of cim- stances operate to the injnry of morls. Soue pegt re. prelates had asserted that the clergy were prohibited fron eelebratingsuch marriages asthe present biUl-.asintezde. legalize; but it was worthy of observation that ther sic iu'tance on record of a clergyman beig punshed for-doing so. The clergy of some of the most populous parshes. - a petition presented to their lordships' House, stated that bis prohibition was productive of unhappiness, and in.sejne case of imnorality, and they therefore psayed {or. its removal. The act of the noble and learned loi d-notnov. present (Lord Lyndhurs) had placed their lordships in 'a, dilemma. A number of those marages had been con, tracted, although the eclesiasticaI law declared thema incestuous, ana the noble and learned lords bill, which- wsa passed without a dissentient voice, declared them legB.A [Tbe Bishop of Exeter.-" No, no !'] The right rev. .preate dissented from this, because he had some crotchet tt.at. the ecclesiastical courts had still the power of . punishing these persons. He had no hesitation in'saying, on the authority of Sir W. Follett, that had the ecclesiastical courts meddled with them the courts of law would baye interposed; and, even had the courts of law remained, quiet, Parliament would have stepped in to prevent-any such exercise of ecclesiastical power. MIuchad been si4 lately withregardtothela-wolScotland on tnis point. -A - renmarkaile judgment had lately been pronounced by or.e of the Lords of Session with regard to this subject. Tbe Lord Ordinary had said: "'Idarriage,' says St. Paul, ' is honourable in al,' and a-ainst every restriction by mere human authority -on t6D liberty of marriage the Piotestant testimony standgsecorded. Accordingly, the Scottish law of restraint on-uarria6e is avowedly founded on the Divine urohibition. Tihe doctrine of the reformed churches is, that marriage shlal be as free as the law of God has left it ; and the Divine law st containedin the 18th eabpter of Leviticus is imported - iMi> the Scottish statute of 1567, chap. 14, and is referred toiii the next statute of 1567, chap. 15. All connexioes ewpressly prohibited by the Divine law in this 18th chapter of Leviticns are declared by the statute law of Scotland. (1567, chap. 14) to be incestnous and punishable with death. To find the express prohibition against marriage with t*he sister of a deceased wife, it is necessarv not only to examine t.he Scriptures, but more particularly to coinstrue the 1Sth chapter of Leviticus, and if there is awo express prohibition there the connexion is not inoestnons_There has been no such series of deeisions, no shichk solemn deliverance, and no such settled judicial practice` a: to amount to an authoritative constraction of the statute;. and rehevethe Court from the necessity of construing it by the canon of the 18th chapter of Leviticus. Then, the de;claration in the Confession of Faith, and the Parliamentay ratification of that confession, thouch binding on the Pregbyterian chnrch, andthough, perhaps, binding on the state 0f a Presbyterian country to civil effects, is not binding as-a. legislative construction of the prohibition of the Divine lawi to the effect of creating a capital crime. The question', 'What says the statute?P throws us bacl on the other n nestion, 'IlWhatis expresslyprohibited'in theL 18th chapterofLeviticus? NTothing less than an express prohibition call'e hsutlcient. If there is no express prohibition, it is not within the statute. On this point the Lord Ordinary wouldwillingly defer to the authority of the Confwssion of Fai!h, but itn this Protestant country, which refuses to ecclesiastical authority tlheight to create or declare a crime, it is im-- possible to escape fromii the responsibility of fonuing an indenendent opinion. With great diffidence, therefore, aua -with unfegned respect for the many learned and exeellent persons-who have arrived at an opposite conclusion, the Lord Ordinarv ventures to e.xpress his opinion that there i& in th2eDi Iaw, and more especially in the 18th chapter of Leviticus, no such ' express prohibition' of this mxrriage as to make it incestulous under the statute." These marriages -were permitted in every comutry of Europe; even in Russia, in some cases. In France, which -VaS a Rooman Catholic country-not recognizing, however, the Council of Trent-and where marriage was a civil contract, permission to celebrate them was granted as a matter of course by the Alinister of Justice. HewouldnowrefertoacountrynmoreresemblingEngland in language and laws-the United States of America. There it was not only the opinion of the heafds of the law, among whom were Chancellor Kent and Mr. Justice Story, baJc also of the bishops of the Episcopal church, that these marriages were neither inconsistent with Scripture nor with the wellbeing of society, and that they were lavful marriages, and the best which under some peculiar ciresnistances, could be contracted. The Americans were neot .i irreligions or immoral reople; and would their lo sbhi' pretend to set vain apprehensions against tleir practical etperience? On-what ground, therefore, would the House be iustified in refng to agree to the present bill ? Be xighbhe told that there was something peculiar in the position of a sister-in-law-;but would not the same observation applY to any other female friend of the husband? And was it not' calmunionsto the characterof theparties tosaytbatdari#,gtihZ life of a man's wife, feelings might grow up, if thermarriages he now advocated were lawful, between the husband andl his sister-in-law which did not grow up between him ana any other female friend? Some of the most able writers hadheldthat these marriages were desirable, and that Lo, one woulld make so Ind a mother-in-law as the sister of the deceased wife. But he did not rest his support of the lbill on that ground, but he maintained that these niarniges oulght notto be prohibited unless there were sone paramount eliginusobeetionto them, or unless some ovrmwheiming social evil couldbe shown as likely to flow from thUem. The petitioners in favour of the bill had petitioned Parliament in the most respectful terms. had invited discussion ion the subject, and lad excitedaconsiderable feeing in their favour throughout the thinldng and moderate clians He had already alluded to the fact, sho'f'ing the growing sentiment in favour of these marriages, that the bill on the subject was rejected in the Haouse of Commnons in 1$49 and sent up to their lordships in 1S49. It was said by so:e that it was not worth while to legislate for so small a, number of persons, but he assured their lordships that the number was not so small; but in the existing stat-e of tbe law manypersons were reluaunt to make kmown thattheyhad contracted these marriazes; and several of the uirarriages likewise were contractel by persons in humble circaumstances. and were not, therefore, easily a-oertainable. Nevertheless, it was known that a vastnumber of these marriages had taken place, and the number was increasmng, and, consequently, by refusing to sanction them the Legislatare was laying up a la' e stoc, of future misery and litigation. Though there might be some doubt as to the legality of these marriages contracted by persons going abroad for the purpose, he-was told that in the case of a tone fde domicile abroad, Sir F. Kelly and other lawyers had held that there could be no doubt asto. the legality of the marriages. He would next call the attention of their lordships to the observations of Sir W. Blacatone -with regard tot e necessity cf obeying the lawv:- -> "It is held, it is true, and very justly, by the principal of our ethical writers that human laws are binding on men's consciences; but it that were the only or mnust forcibl oblition the good only ;would reard the laws, an.d the bal -Awould set them at defiance.

Mr. PALK askled if the Secretary to the Admiralty could infonn the House what number of tickets were issued on the occasion of the naval review, to the clerks of the Admiralty, and whether those tickets were transferrabia or I not? Mr. OSBORNE repled, that it was the intention of the First Lord of the Admiralty to explain to the House that evening the arrangements which had been made by his department in connexion with the naval review. (Hear.) KARS. Mr. J. PHILLIMORE gave notice that, on the motion of the hon. and learned member for Enniskillen Mr. Whiteside), he would move as an amendaent the omission of al the words after the word "that," in order to insert other words providing for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the circumstances attending the surrender of Kars, and especially whether any neglect of duty on the part of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, or any inattention to the statements and representations of General Williams, the British Commissioner, were among the main causes to which that calamitous event was to be attributed. ISLANDS OF THE DANTUBE. Mr. FRENCH gave notice that on ronday next he would askthe First Lord of the Treasury -whether the islands at the mouth of the Danube were, under the treaty of peace, to be restored to Turkey or retained by Russia? NATIONAL GALLERY. Mr. WELLS asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether the Government had come, or was about to come, to any decision as to the removal of the National Gallery of pictures from Trafalgar-square to the site recently purchased at Brompton, in accordance with the recommendation of the committee of 1854; and whether any, and, if so, what opportunity would be afforded to the House' of expressing its opinion on the subect of that recommendation ? Lord PALMERSTON replied that, according to the opinion expressed by a majority of the committee of 1854, tme present site of the National Gallery was injurious to the pictures, which it was exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to preserve from the deposit of all sorts of impurities. The committee, therefore, recommended that the Gallery should be transferred to the ground recently purchased at Brompton, and it was the intention of theGovernment to take steps for that purpose; but until plans and estimates had been obtained, and a decision arrived at as to the best mode of carrying out the recommendations of the committee, no definstive measures could be adopted. Moreover, the expenses would requireto be voted by Parliament, and in that way the House must necessarily have nder itS consideration, before any decisive steps could be taken, any plan which-the Government might determine to WILLS ANI) AJDAD ISTRATION BILL. In reply to Mir. R. Pnamroan, The SOLICITOR-GENERAL stated that it was the intention of the Government to proceed with this bill as soon as possible. He added that if the Marriage and Divorce Bill, together with theTestamentaryB,ll,were passed the whole of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts would be sweptaway, save that given under the Church Discipline Act, which wouldprobably remain until another session. WMr. DADEELD inquired whether the Wills and Administrations Bill would be brought on that evening? The SOLICITORGENERA did not think that there was the smaUest probability of the bill being reached in time for its discussion. Mis object in nutting it on the paperwas to have the benefit of any chance that might arise. (A laugh) POSTAL COMMUNICATION WITH DUBLIN. In reply to Mr. H. HbnEnrT, Mr. WILSON stated that up to the present time no correspondence had taken place between the Government on the one hand, and the London and North-Western and the Chester and Holvhead Railway Companies and the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company on the other, with regard to the acceleration of the postal and passenger commuication between London and Dublin. There were good reasons for the delay which had occurred, but he hoped the time had now arrived when the Government would be able to propose a tender to those companies in a definitive form, ana vfhen, in the course of a fewv weekis, the arrangements for aelerating the communication between London and Dablin would be completed. MILITARY REWARDS. On the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn till Monday, Mr. STAILEY rose to ask the Under-Secretary for War whether any distinguishing mark of honour or re. ward was to be given to those officers and men who had been engaged in the arduous duty of the trenhes, and attacks upon the works of the enemy during the siege of Sebastopol; or whether it was intended that the Crimean medal and Sebastopol clasp, which was bestowed ulpon all, however employed, was to be the only mark of t enduring constancy displa;yed by those gallant men through all the hardships and dangers of that pro- tracted siege? Many distingushiing marks of honour and rewards had been given for the various battles that took place during the Crimean ar. The Alma, Inkermnn, and Balaklava clasps, the Crimean modal and the Sebastopol clasp had been distributed with a iavmsh hand; butD he did not complain of that, for there were reasons why the whole army actively engaged in the war should partake of the honours bestowed bythe country. -But hethought that some special distinction should be conferred upon those officers and men who were employed day and night in the trenches, and ergaged in both the attacks upon the Redan, which were, perhaps, as severe struggles as any that took place during the war. He could name one young man who during the llmontha of the siege was every fourth night inthe he s and ened not only in the attacks upon the Redan, bus in every battle fought, from the commencement to the end of the Crimean war. That gallant soldier had received nod isbinuh mark of honour beyond those conferred upon an officer who might not have been more than a few days i the Crimea and yet there could be no comparison between the teils and b-arhips endured bq the one and tholeesustainad by'tbr other. Mr. PEEL said that there oDihbe no doub twhatevertha( the duty in the trenches- -when the dangers and the diffi- culties and theprivations underwhichit hadbeenoreformed 'were considered-was one of the most arduous duties that a.- gallant army had ever been called upon toperform (cheers), and everyone must gntefuly acbrowledge that it had been - performed by our so diers with the most generous bravery and zeal. (Cheers.) It WAs, therefore, *te natural for the hon. member to inquire whether the Government intended to confer any xaark of distinctlc upont that portion of the army which hit -be called the -7harde-st wor'ked"' portion of th, th (Mr.Feel beggod tostate that t wa intnc. gleSebastopol clasp s hould indude this among other services, its o'bect being to rewad those who hadcontrbtt h tof eb op those who had so oontributed note ha done more thtnthe offioers and men enagedin the trenches. (Hear.) He di' not think that it altered the chacter of that clap that others wore it whose degree of merit was possibly of an inferior order; nor did he think that it would be ioble to giveanydistinctionthe princple of which should be that all vwho wore it should be of orecisely the same degree of merit. (Hear, hear.) Be could not, therefore recommend a separate. distinction for those who had done duty in the trenches, meritorious as he amitted that duty to have THE DISEMBODIED 1M.TA. Lord C. HA3IILTON, [referring to the course which had been pursued at the close of the last war, when there were placed upon the permanent staff of the militia an.adjutant, a paymaster, a surSeon, and a quartermaster, and whien certaan subaltern officers and others received reduced allow' ances, dwelt npon the claims of the militia officers in general and of the surgeons in particular, and asked what were the itentions of the Government with regard to the constitution of the permanent staff of the militia in the event of that force being disembodied ? llr. PEEI replied that the whole question was now engaging the attention of the Government, and that as soon as a decision should be come to upon it the result would be communicated to the lords-lleutenants of counties. 31ASTERS IN THE NAVY Mr. LA.YARD, who had given notice of a question with respect to the accuracy of a return on the subject of masters in the navy presented to the House in March last, said that he had-a small grievance against the Admiralty to which he wished to direct attention. It had nothing to do with the memorable events of Wednesday last, because he had too much experience of the Admiralty to venture out toSrpithead under their guidance. (Cheers and laughter.) X grievance was the refusal of an act of justice to a meritonous branch of the,public service, last year he called attention to the case of the masters of the loyal navy,' whose lives were exposed to every danger, and who wereresponsible for the navigation of the vessel and for every. thing that occurred. Notwithstanding their arduous and meritorious services, those officers had no means of being promoted unt0l an order inCouncilwasissuedwhichenablec the Admiralty to make them commanders or lieutenants. "Since the issue of that order inCoumcil he (7sr. layard) was anxious to knowwhathad been done inthe wayof promoting those officers ; andhe, therefore, movedfora retun upon the subject. No sooner did thatreturn appear than he received a vast number of letters, complaining of the gross errors which it contained. Those who had most distinguished themselves had been omitted from it altogether, hvfiile the services of others, of a very high order, had onlylbeecs mentioned in an indifferent manner. Mr. Ball for example -one of the most meritorious officers of this class-took the Penelope off the rocks under very heavy fire; but his name, although in the despatches, did not even appear in the return. Mr. Williams, ¶in. of the Miranda, was distinguished throughout the whole of the Baltic campaign; he navigated the iranda in the 'White Sea, and rwhen com- elled by the season to leave there he vwent into the Black ea, and buoyed the sea of Azof. That gentleman's services wvere described in the return as " operations in theL 'White Sea." He (Mr. Iaysrd) confessed that he was indignant, when he saw men, who had shed their blood in their country's service, disposed of in such a 'wy. (Hear, hear.) He supposed that some unfortunate clerk would be madethe scapegoat for this inaccurate return; and he heard that a supplemental zeturn was to be presented. If he could direct the attention of the House to' the subject, and could obtain justice for the meritorioust officers to whom he had referred, he should be satisfied. (Hear, hear.) Mr. OSBORNE begged the hon. gentleman not to forget the private explanation upon this subject which he (Mr. Osborne) hadgven him; because, before the hon.gentleman bad called his attention to it, a mistake had been discovered at the Admiralty; and though the hon. gentleman had endeavoured to cut the ground from under his feet by stating that some unfortunate clerk wfould prophbly be madn the scapegoat, he jttr. Osborne) should not hy te blme upon any such pecrson. Thc error had occurred through the inadvertence of a gentleman at the head of a department wahr had been recently appointed, andvwho w as so anxious to furnish the return that he failed to comprare the despatche with the returns. That gentleman had received a vey severe ''johation"' (laughter) before the hon. gentleman. mentioned the subject to him (Mr. Osborne); and when the hon. gentleman said that a supplemental return was promised, the fact wras that it had been ready seven days ago, and that if anybody were to blame for its non-appearance, it; was the printer. Hehad informed the hon. gentleman who was so desirous of making captious criticisims on the Admiralty, privvately, on his honour, that it was a mistake. (A laugh.) Thehon. gentleman knewthat-he knew it & wee1k ago; and under the circumstnces he (Mr. Osbornel could not admire the spirit which dictated such au attack as had just been made ata momentwhentheAdmiralty -perhapsa little unpopular. ("Oh, oh!" and laughter.) A DAY OF THANKSGIVING FOR THE PEACE. Mr. BYNG rose to cadl the attention of Government to the statement made on Monday night that, while no day of thanksvng or special form of prayer had been proposedr on the restoration of peace, inasmuch as the conditions of the said peace had not as yet been formally iatified, preparations for expenditure on alarge scale had been authorized by t'ne Secretary of State for the War Department in celebration of the above event. As to the mere queslton whether rejoicing should or should not take place in the shape of fireworlks and illuminations, upon that he did not intend to touch. There existed with regard to that subject some diversity of opinion, but as to the existence of a feeling of deep anduniversal gratitudethat the countrywassparedthl repetition of the horrors of war no doubt could possibly be entertained. (Hear, hear.) It was a question which affected every member of that House, and which -went to the heartof every man, woman, or child throughout the whole length and breadth of the land. The deep feeling which he entertained upon the subject would, ho trusted, be his authority for bringing the question before the House, for he felt it to' be his duty to press upon the Government the propriety o0 affording the country some opportunity of displaying the gratitude which was so genery felt. (Hear, hear.) He would not insist that it was necessary to set apart a whole day for that purpose, but he thought that if Her Majesty in Councilvwere to direct that some simple form of prayer' should be used in the churches on the Sundaypreceding the display of fireworks, it would be deeply responded to by all classes, of whatever sect or creed they might be. (Hear.) In Paris and in St. Petersburg the feelin of the country had been amply manifested, and he trasted that the people of this country would notlbe behindhand in showing their gratitude for the treaty of peace. (Hear.) Sir G. GREY regretted that any misapprehension should have been occasioned by an answer which hqhad given on a former occasion to a question which had been addressed t him upon the subject. He had been asked what day it wan proposed to set apart as a day of thanksgiving, and he hoped that there -was nothing in the answer which he had given which implied that he did not feel as deeply as the hon. gentleman that there was ample cause for gratitude at the termination of the war. He had stated that there was no precedent for the appointment of a day of thanksgiving until a peace had been ratified, and that it would be premature to appoint one. It had hitherto been the uniform practice, on the restoration of peace, to adopt some means of displaying publicly the gratitude of the reople of the country, and it certainly was not the intention of the Government to deviate from that practice upon the present occasion, and, in fact, his noble friend at the head of the Government had been in communication withltheArchbishop of Canterburyupon the subject. It was obvious that, if Her Majestyin Councildirected a general thanksgiving, it would not take any considerable time to prepare a form of prayer for the occasion, and, indeed, the preparation of suCh a form of prayer mip,ht begoing on wgith. out the public being aware of it; while, as regarded the display of fireworks, some time must elapse before the necessary preparations, andthose preparations must be open and patent to all. He could only add that it was the intentiorn of the Government to advise Her Majesty to appoint a publiec thanksgiving, and it was not improbable that that thanksgvincg would be offered up before the display of fireworks took place. THE DESPATCH OF TROOPS TO CANADA. Mr. LAfING rose to ask for some explanation as to the intention of the Government of sending troops to CanadaThere had been some days back an announcement in 2Vsc Timcs -newspaper that it was the intention of the Govern. ament to send 10,000 men to Canada, and there was ahl article in the paper assigning certain reasons for that line of policy; and on the same evening, in answer to a question which had been put in another place, Lord Panmure gave a different version of the matter. Lord Panmure stated that the sole intention of the Government ws to send back tc Canada those regiments andmunitions of war which had been drawnfromthat colony under the temporary exigencies of tho 'war, andthusto restorethingsto the same condition inwhich they were before the war. In his opinion, some further explanation was necessary, in order that the public should be fully informed as to what was intended, because it had not always been proved that the information of the War-office was better than that of the prems. Taking, however, the statement of lord Panmure to be perfectly correct, some further explanation -was still necessary, because the troops were withdrwn from Canada in accordance with the new system of colonial policy, and not to meet a temporary emergency. When the troops were withdrawn, it was said that the measures which had been passed giving to tho colonists power of self-iovernment would enable a portion of the British troops tobe withdrawn from the colomes, and that our army being kept together, instead of being scattered over the world, it would obtain greater efficiency. He wished to know whether or not it was now intended to depart from that principle,? and if it were intended to do so the presentlaw was most ill-chosen for the experiment. He could not imagine inything more mischievous, or more calculated to prevent the relations of this country with the United States becoming of a more friendly character, than anything which could be construed into a threat. The sonmd sense of the inhabitants of the Unitei States was decidedly in favour of a good wide±stallinA with Great-Britain; but the Americans C M high spirit, and were extremely susceptible; and ai. did eot kst any people in the world less likely to be coerce by a threat.

- LOA-DON, SATURDAY, AP)1L 2, 1856. In the House of Lords yesterday, Earl STANorx postponed his motion for a committee of inquiry -into the question of secondary unishments, the Government having promised to lay on the table the evidence taken before the committee of the House of Commons on the same subject. The Marquis of L-SDOws declared the Government had every wish, to promote the object Eari Srsraorxhad in view; the ticket-of-leave jsystem had not been sufflciently tested to enable the Government to come to a satisfactory decision; but he believed no system of secondary pushmeht would work well in this country without the auxilary of transportation. Earl Gary and Lord D -GoX urged the Government to take some decisive steps on the subject of tickets of leave with as little delay as possible. The Earl of ELGaa gave notice that on the 6th of May he should move for papers relating to military establishments and the reorganization of the nilitia in the British colonies of North America. Earl GnAwvmri, to remove the effects of the discussion of the previous evening, stated the instructions the Admiralty had given to insure proper acconimodation for the Peers at the naval review ; they were all based on the assumption that their Lordships would arrive at Southampton at a qiurter past 9, and he contended that the failures were caused by the delay and breaking down of the trains on the South-Western line. The engaines of the Trnsit were not defective, but the steam was reduced by the fires having been allowed to go out. An inquiry hadbeen made into the matter. The !arl of Cr. rICsADjE asked who was responsible for what -was done or not done on the railway, and whether Parliament had any power of punishinm the delinquents. He believed it had not, and he hoped greater power of control over the railway companies was given to the Government by the bill now before Parliament. Earl ST. GER=AS moved the second reading of the bill for the amendment of the law of marriages. The object of the measure is to legalize marriace with a deceased wife's sister. Earl Sr. GRHAN-s recapitulated most of the arguments urged in favour of these marriages in former debates on the same question, supporting them by citations from the Fathers, the Levitical law, and other authorities. The Bishop of OxFORD strongly opposed the measure. It would place the statute law of the coiuntry in direct conflict with the common and ecclesiastical law, as by both these such marriages were undoubtedly condemned. The Church of England and that of Scotland, the Latin and Greek Churches, condemned them also as contraryto the law of GoD; and, even if it were doubtful, it was safer to lean to thecoursewhichwouldprevent personsfromincurring the risk of breaking it. No proof had been given ot a necessityfor the neasure. Earl Sr.GimYsi-s had been led astray by a spurious kindness to a few to attempt to effect what would be a great injuryto the many. The Christian instinct of the educated women of Englandwas decidedly opposed tothebill, arnd many things were better decidedby that instinct than by the elaborate arguments of reasoning men. He asked the House to reject the bill by such a majority as would discourage its future agitation, and concluded by moving as an amendment that it be read a second time that day six months. The Earl of AmBszvAnLm real several ancient canons of the Roman Church which had lost all force, and contended that the canons on which the prohibitiorn of these marriages was founded might also be set aside. Lord DuNo.mxoN supported the.amendment, Lord RAvmzsworPrr would vote for the secnd reading; he believed a strict adherence to the canonical prohibitions caused great domestic demoralization. Lord CArnrr.L opposed the measure; he contended that public opmnion had g reatly changed on this sulbject, the majotrites for it in the House of Commons had gradually decreased, till the promoters of the bill had been compelled to abandon it. The Bishop of CAsnra and the Bishop of ST. DAvi's supported the amendment. Earl Gxz had not heard some of the arguments used by Earl ST. GrtsADs at all controverted. Neither of the bishops had declared that there was a direct prohibition of these marriages in the Word of GOD; it was a matter of inference. The prohibition by human laws had been very mischievous ;,the law was daily broken, and in no other Protestant country was the prohibition reoognized After brief addresses from the Bishop of ExErmi Lord CoNCGLzToN, and the Earl of E }E (the latter in support of the measure), the Earl ST. G _S replied, and the Eouse divided. The numbers were, for the second reading,-Contents 24; non-contents, 43; majority against the seoona reading, 19. The House then adjournecd in the House of Commons, in reply to MIr. R. PwEIIMOrE, The Somcrron-C-GENAL said that, notwithstand. ing the rejection of the Church Discipie Bill in the other House,it was the intention of the Government to proceed with the Wills and Administrations Bill as soon as possible. On the motion that the House at it& rising co adjourn until Monday, Mr. 0. STAr.Lv as-ed if any distinguishing mark- of honour Qr roward was to be given to thox
The fall of Ears will become the subject of renewed discussion on Monday next. It is a proof of the deep impression which this disaster has made that the memory of it survives even the conclusion of peace .and the restoration of the lost territory. It is the plausible argument of many persons that no good can come of examining into events which are past and gone. Ears cannot be saved, the campaign of 3Iingrelia cannot be refought by any debates in Parliament or any inquiries at Chelsea. Why, then, it may be said, resiume a fruitless discussion which -cannot change events, and may only degenerate into an angry and tedious controversy? But the -common sense anac right feeling of the country have strongly pronounced against such reasoning. For the sake of the future-for the honour of the men who bore a part in the unavailing struggle, -and who are only now to be restored to their -country and friends-let us have a full examination even of past events and disasters, which are now irremediable. Justice demands such a -course, and no shortsighted seeking for im.- -mediate results should induce the country to err from it. It is evident that the alleged reasons for the fall of Kars may be divided into two heads. 'The first relates to the corruption of the Turkish -authorities, the want of due preparation for a campaign, and the neglect of General Wuinra-rs ,by the British Ambassador. The second has to do -ith affairs subsequent to the investment of the place, the obstacles said to be opposed to Om&u PTAsA, the bad choice of a point of operations, and the supposed treachery of the commander at Erzexoum. WVe have before given an opinion that when MorivruEFF had invested the city, when summer -as passing away, and provisions were already rumning short at Kars, all efforts would probably have been unavailing for a rescue. The place was virtually lost, and, though mistakes may have been -committed which subsequent criticism can expose, we ought not to seek the causes of the calamity in -the period immediately before its occurrence. However, all parts of the history will receive a due examination; it is better, therefore, once mnore to recur to the earlier events, and point out the dependence of each incident on those which went before it. The first months of General WnLws's service in Armenia were passed, as we all know, amid the insolence and ill-will of the Turkish officials, who were not check;ed in their shameful course by any renionstrances on the part of those who should giave supported the British General. Into the -elations between the Commissioner and Lord STRATFORD DE REDCurFE it is not our purpose again to enter. Enough has been said on the -suoject to enable the public to form a judgment with accuracy. The reports current on -the matter have been fully confirmed by the I,lue-book lately published. It may be tak-en for granted, then, that {or some reaaon oni which we cannot spjliq Genoral--W3ir s-fircurredthe dislike of the Bjitb-, lipresentAisde- at Cdn-- stantinople,-the man w;liitfrolm liisposition and his -1 lonig residence in the El ast CO!xld most eff%ctually aid him or hinder him in his exdeavours. The tacit acknowledgment of Ministeit' of political partisans, of personal acquaintane*s, bs fully admitted the unworthiness of the - Auibmasso?s cdnduct, and there is nothing more to be said on the subject. All that remains is to inquire what influence this neglect had on the actual results of the campaign. It is, of course, natural to say that the disputes complained of took place in the winter which preceded the siege, and that for some time before Kars was invested the interchange of angry despatches had ceased. But we think that such a defence will not bear examination. General WiLmA!is arrived in Armenia il September, 1854. At that time the Turkish arny was entirely disorganized. Five battles had been lost within seven months by a succession of incapable and profligate commanders. The soldiers were without pay, without clothing, often without food. The Russians were known to be making great efforts for another campaign. Men and materials wsere brought not only throughl the Caucasus, but from Astrachan to the western ports of the Caspian. It will not be supposed that for what General WILLIAMs bad to do there was too much time. We know that in this rich and civilized country, nith so much genius and so many resources, it is necessary to begin in autumn the preparations for a campaign in the ensuing spring. Even Birmingham and Woolwich cannot extemporize weapons and material, nor canl the most hardworking officers turn raw recruits into soldiers in less than a given time. General WILLIAMS, withoiit any legitimate power but that of advice, had to reform the Generals, reconstruct the army, purify the administration, and provision the fortresses of two important and remote provinces. Can it be said that if, through the neglect or ill-will of any man, five months were lost, and the season of activity returned without the season of intermission having been fitly used, the person who was the cause of this delay is not responsible for the haste and unreadiness of subsequent proceedings I But from general considerations we may descend to facts. Kars, it is well known, fell by famine, and not by assault. On one occasion only (lid the Russian General attack those well-planned forts, the construction and defence of which are such an honour to British officers. He was repulsed with slaughter. It can hardly be denied that if the place had been well provisioned it would probably have been held through the entire winter. Nay, it is almost certain that if MouRAviExu had not known that famine was doing his work within the walls he would have retreated after the great assault of September. Now, General W mIMS had laboured almost from the beginning at the collection of supplies. His chief object in desiring the attainment of Turkish military rank and the acknowledgment of his official position was that he might prepare the defence of tlle two fortresses of Erzeroum and Kars. Yet, owing to the neglect of his remonstrances at Constantinople, it was not till February the 25th, after he had been five mbnths in the country, that he obtained his first victory over his opponents and the recoganition of his personal authority through the exertions of Lord CLARA -oN. Then it was that he was enabled to begin all that ought to have been done during the winter. The results of the delay are at once evident. On April the 20th Colonel LAT informs the General that, though it is expedient to call the Ardahan detachment into Kars, it is impossible to do so, owing to the great scarcity of food in the place. " There are," he says, " only 15 "days' provision in store for the troops now in "garrison. General WTLTA:s is found at once actively engaged in supplying these deficiencies. Four days after the date of Colonel LAxx's letter he writes to Lord CLAnmDoK:"Neither land carriage for the army at Kars nor "the provisions for that force are to be had in "sufficient quantities, and I have this day re"ceived intelligence from Colonel LAxE draw"ing my attention to these points, and "echoing the prayers I have in vain addressed "during the winter to Constantinople." He then tells how he is using every effort to obtain grain in the neighbourhood, and represents that "it is absolutely necessary that the Govemors of "D,iarbekir, Kharpoot, and the more remote pro"vinces should be ordered to forward provisions." It must be remembered that summer had nowbegun, and the Russian armies were already in the field. The necessity for immediate and energetic action was every day more evident. On the 1st of May-little more than a month before MourRnAvi= appeared at Kars-General W=A-uis again addresses the Ambassador, and this despatch is the best answer to those who would divest the conduct of Lord STRATFORiD of all influence in the fate of Kars. " Several weeks ago," writes the Commissioner, " I "adclressed your Lordship on the necessity of my "having authority to take an active part in the "purchase of provisions for this army; but, al"though Lord PAiiuRp has expressed his decided " sentiments on this vital point, I have not received " a line in allusion to it from your Excellency, "and I have to state that this army cannot be sup"plied with provision without I can control those "who have this matter in their hands. Colonel "L i informs me that the provision has dwin"dled down to ten or twelve days' supply, and I "have not authority to oblige the Medj1is to expe"dite food to our force, which I may soon have7to "designate as a starving army." All the comment that we have to make on this despatch is that it seems to have been treated like so many of its predecessors. There is in the blue-book no answer from Lord STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE. Now, however, we have to learn what an earnest man can do. On the 7th of May nothing had reached Kars ; but by unceasing exertions General WinLI,IS had two days before sent off a supply from Erzeroum, and from this time the stock steadily increases. On the 3d of June there are nearly four months' provisions in Kars. Thus, in the space of four weeks the Commissioner, by his personal influence, was able to provision the chief stronghold of the country and prepare for a defence which may vie with the noblest deeds in history. We may now ask what would have been the result if General WinLIAMS had been acknowledged, upheld, encouraged, from the time he landed in Asia, in September, 1854 ? Suppose that, instead of commencing his preparations in March or April, he had had fair powers of control six months before, can any one believe that the disaster of Kars would have occurred at all? May it not, on the contrary, be fairly presumed that the Turkish army, well disciplined, well fed,. and under competent leadership, would have won distinction even in offensive warfare? Whatever discussion may arise as to subsequent events-whatever judgment may be passed on the foresight of the allied Governments or the skill of the Crimean Generalsone great fact must still stand conspicuous-that Kars fell by famuine, and that famine would have been avoided had not a meritorious British officer received neglect and contumely at the hands of those who should have been foremost to uphold him.
t There was considerable diversity of opinuon on Thursday night in the Lower House as to the propriety of giving fuither extensioi to the gystml of open competition- anong candidates-for admissi bn^ to the Civil Service. Tje result -was that L,rd GODZIUC cirried his raotlo l in favour- of open dotirsby a majority of 21. It is not our-desira-to enter uipon the general argun ent just now, andfcr the simple reasoin that it is too ojzueral. The dragnet takes too wide a sweep. lsn certain departments it is highly necessary and just that appoint4 ments should be conferred upon, candeiates -who may have acquitted themselves best at a'public examination; in others we can readily conc vs that it is wiser for the moment to -leave a certalit discretion in the hands of individuals. Lord GoDBr.IcH anld MIr. LaBsoucnn, Sir S. - NORTHcoTz and Mr. LusHMGTO2, said on Thursday night all that was to be said upon tlie general question, and we will confine ourselves to the humbler, but perhaps thc more useful task, of recording the result of competitive. examination in one department, in which the experiment has certainly been productive of the most beneficial results. We have just received the report *on the examlnation for appointments to the Royal Artilery and Practical CLass of the Bilitary Academy at Woolwicli. The examination was held at Burlingtosihouse on the 21st of January of the present year. It Iasted until the 1st of February, and the resultis nov before us, together with copies of the examuination papers. This is the second occasion on which the advantages indicated by the title to the report have been thrown open to public competition. It is satisfactory to find that, in the opinion of the examiners, certain subjects excepted, the candidates have shown themselves considerably superior to their predecessors in August of last year. The only change which has taken place in the scheme of the examination is that a different acale of marks has been assigned to the various subjects. To each subject a higher number of marks was given.; the numbers assigned to each subject were made to differ more widely from one another; finally, the mathematical subjects were rated higher in the scale. Thus to pure and mixed mathematics were allotted 3,500 marks, while to the languages, literatures, and histories of Ancient Rome, Ancient Greece, France, and Germany there were assigned collectively the same number-that is, 3,500 marks. Of these Rome received 1,000 marks; Greece, 750; France, 1,000; Germany, 750. There were bestowed. 1,250 marks for English language and literature, composition, history, and geography. The experimental sciences-chymistry, heat, electricity, including magnetism-carried 1,000 marks, while to the two sciences of geology and mineralogy, which are distinguished as natural sciences, but 500 marks are assigned. The moral and political sciences, with 1,000 marks as their portion, close the list. The candidates for the provisional commissions in the Artillery were to be between the ages of 20 and 22 years; those for the Practical Class at Woolwich between 18 and 20. No candidate was allowed to approach the examination tables who did not exhibit a reasonable proficiency in drawing, and the examination in mathematics preceded that in all other subjects, with the view of reducing the number of candidates to two-thirds. When we add that on the 21st of January last 50 'candidates were brought under examination, of whom 24 sought for provisional commissions, and 26 for admission to the Practical Class, aUl is said that need be said about the preliminary arrangements;-it remains that we should glance at the resmt. Of the 24 candidates for commissions 17 were successfuL Seven of these were from Trinity College, Dublin, four from Cambridge, three from Oxford. One was from 'University College, London, one from Edinburgh University, and one was a civil engineer. Dublin bore away the palm, but contributed at the same time the greater number of candidates. In the case of Dublin 7 out of 9 were successful; in the case of Cambridge 4 out of 5; in the case of Oxford 3 out of O. In the result of the examinations for the Practical Class Dublin was equally successful. Four youths presented themselves from the Irish University, and all four were accepted. The English UJniversities did not take any share in the competition. The different schemes of education pursued at these seats of learning and the more advanced age at which the students are entered preclude all idea of competition on the part of Cambridge or Oxford for such a prize as admission to the Practical Class at Woolwich. Three of the successful candidates had received a private education. The Collegiate Institution at Liverpool sent one, and one candidate from each of the following places obtained admission-namely, the Bristol Grammar-school; the College St. Barbe, at Paris; King Edward's School, Bath; Marlborough College; Tunbridge School; Cowbridge Grammar-school. Fourteen succeeded in all. We may presume that the candidates who were rejected were rejected on the actual ground of incompetency, inasmuch as in the memorandum from the War Department under which the examination was arranged we find it announced that about 20 commissions would be given, and about 40 admissions to the Practical Class, provided a sufficient number of candidates proved themselves competent. The result, as we before said, was the grant of 17 commissions for 24 candidates and 14 admissions. The concurrent testimony of the examiners is, that both in mathematics and classics there was a marked improvement in favour of the candidates at this examination as compared with the last. In other words, these young gentlemen had been well grounded in the usual branches of an EngEsh education, but on other points they broke down. As might have been expected, one of the most faulty points was found to be English and English liteiature. Here is the comment of the report --" There were not so " many total failures as before, but the average "was low, and there were scarcely any who rose "above it." Bad as the case was in English, it seems to have been far worse in French. Most of the candidates were able to hold out for a few minutes in a French conversation, and then, when the few phrases Yuscage and the few recollections of the vocabulary were exhausted, they came to a standstill. " It was easy to see," said the gentlemen who examined in French literature, "that " the candidates had hardly an idea of grammar, " or of writing correctly." It is not very g,rati- fying to our national self-love to read the following passage, which accompanied thereturns of the examiners in French "We positively maintain that on the continent candidates for similar stations would certainly have been re jected on evincing ignorance of the same Ind. Both in lFrance and Germany a tolerable knowledgeof a foreign language has now become obligatory in all schools where the middle and upper classes are brought up. In the lastmentioned country it is by no means rare to meet with boys of 13 and 14 who speak and write two foreign languages cor. rectly, while they are naturally still better proficients in their mother tongue. In regard to general history,we.' venture likewise to assert that no successful candidate for a military or scientific school 'would have committed any gross error relative to the leading features which mark the annals of other European nations." The return for the twenty candidates who presented themselves for examination in the Moral Sciences is not quite so hopeless, but yet far frbm satisfactory. Two only came up to the standard of "' fair ;" three " very nearly approached it." No great triumph this for the Moral Sciences ! Upon the Mathematical and Classical Papers we have no remarks to offer. The examiners and candidates appear to have been equally satisfied with eacl other upon these points. The papers seem fairly enough adapted to the purp6e3 Qt 7;1tiiitga mct' egree. 6 progress i iei.lei I brai>cx of edijoatioi, llUe .rather turn to the tw, I subjects in which the greatest nistak-es mere m --nsmely; the Fir6ich and Elglish pa4ers. The 1gentlemen. vho examined in -reneh Eet before the c,mudidates very sinmple passages for translation from FrJnch into English from th} followving artkhyxs Madame DE SEvIGsN, BossuvT, AP.AGO, RACLSB, II& FONTAniE, F-Nm-oN and Lt BuvtRr.;, and thte last addreu of ArApOLEOw to the Guard at Fontainebleau. TWere are a few passages judiciously enough selected from English authors for translation into French, and a few granimatical queffions of the Simpleat kind. It wvas required of the candidates to wTite a letter in French, nmentionina their reasonx for embracing a military career, to itei of course in French, a brief repoit to a General upon a s-nbject named; to describe the changes introduced by- NAPOLEON- in the art of war. In hlistory -the young gentlemen were ask-ed to- give to the -best of their recollection thae chief events of the disputes between FnP.NCis I. and CrARLES V. ; what were the main causes of the grea. French Revolutioni, and its principal events between 1789 and 1794. There is notning very abstruse in all this. When we turn to the English papers the conclusion of the examiners is ee,udly humiliating for the candidates. There were, perhaps, a dozen questions or s6 which might' as -well have been omitted; for example, we do not expect that a youth of 20 years of age should sit down and give us an epitome of HoBBES's LeviatMan, nor. of Dny:No'Ws Hind anUd Pasiffze on the spur of the moment, but -we have a right to ask that he should tell. us who wrote the Deseited Vl7iaye, A&exander's Feast, the Ba?nber, Samson Agonmistes, and, a few works of the same universal celebrity. We are fairly entitled to inquire on what- rivers Bristol, Exeter, Liverpool, Limerick, and Glasgow stand. We may without over-harshness beg for a brief account of the War of the Roses, and ask what were the points at issue between HENRY If. and To3rsAs A'BECET. Nor, as the examination was for military honours, it does not seem unreasonable to add,"What do you mean by the War of the Succes"sion ? What were the dates of the Peace of "Vienna, 'Utrecht, Ryswick, 'and Amiens ? Name "the chief battles and sieges of the Peninsular "War."
It is certainly high time that Parliament came to a final decision on the rights of the Jews to sit as members of the House of Conimons. Let it be considered what is the present state of the question. -No law prohibits the election of a Jew as it prohibits that of a Peer or a clergyman; but certain oaths are required to be taken by every member before he can speak or vote. One of these is called the Oath of Abjuration. It is to the effect that the descendants of the son of JAmEs H. have no claim to the throne of England; and the swearer further binds himself to uphold to the utmost of his power the succession of the Protestant descendants of the Princess SorHIA. There is nothing in the matter of this oath to which a Jew, or, indeed, any but a Roman Catholic, can object. Part of it, indeed, has become in the present day useless and frivolous, for with the death of Jumas II.'s grandchildrenthe branch of the STUAXT race which the oath abjured is extinct. The limitation of the suCcession to the Princess SorPnIAs descendants, being Protestants, is acquiesced in by a Jew as a matter of course. It may be said, then, that there is no just impediment to any Jew duly taldng the oaths and the seat to which he may have been chosen. But in the form of the oath are the words " on the true faith of a Christian," intended most probably merely to give a solemnnity to the. promise, but, if inserted -with design, certainly meant only to bind with greater stringency the casuistically-instructed consciences of the PRoman Catholics. The course to be taken by a Jew is -obvious. It is to state that all contained in the Oath of Abjuration he wiU heartily promise, but that in the form of the oath there are words which it would be a mockery, if not an apostasy, for him to utter. Recent legislation, approved by every jurist and every man of common sense, has provided that in all causes, civil or criniinal, oaths should be taken according to the form most 'binding on the swearer's conscience, and it is reasonable to demand that a Jew should promise allegiance to the present monarcheial settlement in a similar manner. The House of Commons has already acquiesced in the justice of this demand. It has taken it for granted that no law, express or implied, excludes the Jew from a seat in the House. It has ordered in two cases that a Jew should be sworn with his hat on and holding the Old Testament in his hand. Thus the Commons not only declared it just that Jews should sit in Parliament, but pronounced a decision that there was no existing exclusion. But the form of the oath had been settled by statute, and, though many lawyers were of opinion that the words " on the true faith " of a Christian" were not of the substance of the oath, and might be omitted on the same authority which had substituted the name " JmovAn" for " GoD" and the Old Testament for the New, yet the House wisely determined that it would be mnore constitutional to have the sanction of the whole Legislature for the change. The Lords refused that sanction, and the question, after nine years' discussion, is still unsettled. Against the claims of justice and positive right, against all analogies to be drawn from actual legislation, against the repeatedly-expressed opinions of the Commons, the Upper House refuses to omit the words which debar the Jew from the position to which he has been chosen; but the Lords do this on the most untenable grounds. Their course is one of mere obstruction. Bills sent up to them in various forms have been rejected one after the other, and then they take no further steps in the matter. They will not accept the solution of the Commons, nor propose a solution of their own. The consequence is an anomaly in the institutions of the country. Jews may be elected in any number, and no power exists for declaring their election void, yet they may not tak-e their seats. There is nothing to prevent a fourth, a third, or a half of the House of Commons being excluded from its functions, and yet remaining irremovably a portion of the House. No man can pretend that this is not a scandalous and derogatory condition *of things, and now, when it has lasted during nine years, it is certainly incumbent on every one who doea not wish to make sport of oiur representative system to demand a decision at once. A bill has been brought in to abrogate the Oath of Abjuration. As no descendant of the OLD PRETEuNDra lives, there can be no objection on any side to do away with an unmeaning solemnity. But, as it has been argued that the Protestant succession still demands the acceptance of evcry legislator, Lord JoHN Russixr, to obviate any pretext for Opposition, proposes to substitute for the old oath' a new one, which shall be entitled'" An Oath "for securing the Protestant Succession *to "the Crown as by Law established." The person who talkes it vwill promise to maintain and support and defend the act for linmting the succession to the "Prircess Sor, Electress of Hanover, toand the heirs of her bocly, beiong Pro"testants." The form of swearing will be that in ordinary use, the swearer pronouncing the words " So help me GOD." Now, this bill, thus amended, seems certainly to place the Jewish c queatiou ia a proper position for settlement, The ;*8frict 5bjct {if Ufe ; aislr is i&eppti&i: able, and it «i dOLtcult to imagine what its opporEnts wil have to **y agains~ it. - It does aWay with a useless oath, illich-hMa .3een long felt to be an improper liifing with sacredz 4engagements - It provides more absolutely t6fias bQ.ox for the maintenance of the present settlement, T.'.erefore any. !ciposition must be based on5 Te dcesfri to keep the' i ouestion of Jewish diiabilities' sAin mvolvd4with ; matters -with which they have na concern. I The i-country has, consequently, a rigp to expect that the two questions shall be at once 4Evided 2tnn a proper decison taken on each. By pasing. the bill th6 form of words which accidentally e=ludes the Jew wil be aboished, and it will then ba in the rower of any opponent of the Jews? cfaifs;-to bring in a bill for their express exclusion. ]' the admission of Jews to Faliamnent will unchiistitize the 'Legislature, and deprive our comtry of its claim to the Ci3tian 'name, surely the Quaev and the Estates of tle realm may be tlusted to prevent such a crime. If, also, it; be tiue-tliat the Jew is an alien, and either by eustom or by any statnte incpable of beirTl elected, thea the question- ean be decided to the satisfaction of every one. If the-profession of Christianity was looked upon 'by the framers of the present oath as essential to the, legidative charac-, ter, we shall be able to judge of the question all the more dlearly when it is divested of adventi-, tious: and accidental circunmtances. Let us. therefore have a final discusson of the whole matter on: its own merits. Let us deal-with the; Jewish claims openly, as a question of principle or policy, or even: of prejiudice. Let ius say boldly. 'whether we intend that these 40,000 Elish subjects shall be excludedfrom, rightswihich ae' possessed by the rest of their countrymen:- If the' decision be against the Jews,' then' let it be followed up by a. bil annulling, any election of a Jew, and empowering the SPEAE to issue a new writ - for London. But let not the present state of things continue. It is creditable neither to the Chistianity nor to the dignity of the Lords that they should content themselves with evading a settlement of this question. Hig,h-niiilded legislators are bound to follow out their own plans to their consequences. When a body of men vote against a change in a form of words which produces unforeseen effects they -are bound to introduce a measure which shall make the practical workdng of affairs consistent with'their own interpretation. Until they do this they lie justly under the imputation of moral cowardice or hypocrisy.

The second private investigation held yesterday at MIoate has resulted only in another adjournment, and the further remand of Mr. Strevens, to Wednesday next, when the inquiry will be resumed. The privacy of these proceedings has, as usual, given rise to nunnberles stories and suspicions, some of which, may have- a shadow of foundation in truth, but, evenl -with this admission, are not at this stage worth referring to. The deceased's steward, a man mamed Casey, who hadbeenunderexauminationontheforiner day, was further interrogated at considerable length. Two other witnesses, a girl named Geraghty, and the head constable of police, were also examined. After hearing Mr. Heron at some length in support of Mr.- Strevens's right to be discharged in consequence of the Crowan not having produced any evidence inculpating him, and Mr. Julianand Mr.1 Brady in reply, the Bench decided upon remanding Mi. Strevens and the other prisoners. A further reward of 2001. has been offered fur private information relative to the murder. T-E CATHoLic uNVmsrTry.

The necessity of not Ieaving those States a preto anarchy- had determined France as well as Austria Jb respond to-the request of the Holy See-in occupying Roxxo with her troops, while Austria occupied the Legation. France had a, double motive in deferring -ithqat hesition to the desires of the Holy See-first, as a Catholic; ansi secondly, as a European Power. As the "eldest chid of the Church,'" a title Of which the Emperor vas most proud, IHis Majesty had made it his duty to give his aid to the Sovereign Pontiffi But, further, the tranquillity of thb Roman States, upon which depended the traniquillitv of all Itly, was much too closely connected with the maintefnance of order in Europe for France not to have an interest of the iighestkdndto assist, by all the means inher power, in the preservation of order in the Pope's dominions. He fully saw how much there was that wat abnormal in the situation of-a Power which had-need of the support of foreign troops in order to maintain its authority. He did not hesitate to declare-and he hoped that Count Buol would say as much on the part of Austria-that Trance was not only ready tD w%ithdraw her troops fron Some, but she desired with all her heart that the time when she might do so, without compromising the interest of the Pontifical Government, in which the Emperor took so lively an i#terest, might -not be indefinitely postponed. It was most desirable, in the interest of the equilibrium of Europe, that the French forces should be enabled safely to evacuate the Roman States. He did not doubt that the fian!k expression of these sentiments on the part of Franci and Austria wouldl do good, and produce a favourable impression. " Continuing in the same order of ideas, he felt prompted to inquire whether it was not to be wished that certair Governments in the Italian Peninsula should, by acts of well-considered clemency, conciliate such of their subjects as were not perverted though they had gone astray, and should thus put an end to a system which operated directlycontrarytoitsobject-a system which, insteadof restraining the enemies of order, had for its effect to. wealen' the Governments that acted upon it, andto augment the number of the partisans of demagogy? In his opinion it would be to render a signal service to the Government of the Two Sicilies, as well as to the cause of order, in the Peninsula to enlighten that- Government on the subject of the wrong course which it was pursuing. He thought that a warning conceived in this spirit and comingfrom the Congresswould be wellreceivedbytheN eapolitan Government, whichcould not possibly entertain any suspicion of the motives of advice coming from such a quarter. ' ' Count Walewsld next caled the attention of the Congresssto a subject which, although relating more immediately to. France, was nevertheless one of real interest to All European Powers. Itwaswelluknownthatinulelgium publicationswereprinted every daywhich contained the most hostile and insulting attacks upon France and her Government, and that in these publications revolt and assassination were openly advocated. Very recently some Belgian journals pronounced 'a eulogium on the 'aiaanne,' a. secret society whose tendencies and objects were notoriousi Allthese publications were so many implements of -war directed against the internal tranquillity of France by the enemies of social order, who, strong in the impunity which! they enjoyed under the shelter of - Belgian legislation, cherish the hope of succeeding in their guilty projects. He protested that the sincere desire of the Emperor -Was to maintain the best relations with Belgium, and he hastened to add that Eis Majesty's Government had every rson to be satisfied with the Cabinet of Brussels, which had done its best to mitigate a state of things whicr it was not in its power to change, because the laws of Belgium did not empower it to repress the excesses of the press or to take the initiative of a reform which had become absolutely indispensable. We should regret (the French Plenipotentiary continued) to be placed under the obligation of ourselves making Belgium to understand that it is imperatively necessary to modify a legislation which is not compatible with the fulfilment by her Government of the first of international duties-namely, that of not tolerating intrigues having for their avowed object to disturb the tranquillity of neighbouring States. Any remon strances on the part of a stronger Power would so much resemble a threat that we naturally endeavour, by every possible means, to avoid having recourse to them. If the representatives of the Great Powers, appreciating this necessity from the same point of view as ourselves, should think fit to espress their opinion on the subject, it is pro bable that the Belgian Government, relying upon the great majority of the country, would find itself in a position to put an end to a state of things which cannot fail, sooner or later, to produce difficulties and even dangers which it is the interest of Belgium to avert. ''In conclusion, the Count proposed that the Congress should crovw its labous by a declaration which would constitute a real progress in international jurisprudence, and would be gratefully accepted by the entire world. The Congress of Westphaiia had declared for liberty of conscience; the Congress of Vienna for the abolition of the slave trade and the free navigation of rivers. It would be worthy of the Congress of Paris to put an end to longstanding dissensions by layg down the bases of a uniform maritime code in time of war. The four following principles would completely attain this object :-L The abolition of le Course. 2. That neutral merchandise covers enemy's merchandise, except contraband of war. 3. That neutral merchandise, except contraband of war, cannot be seized1 even under an -enemy's flag. 4. That a blockade is only obligatory so far'as it is real." - _ -

THE BRITISH ARMY. cAMP BEFORE SEBASTOPOL, ARPn 11. [Tho following appeaed in our second edition of yeateray: I1 (nOX ou1 SOCIAT, CORMOXNT.1 *mne preparations for thLe speedy evacuation of the Crimea are pressed on with rapidity and energy. Each division collects about 4,000 shot a-day, and they are carried to Baaklavya as fast as the means at Our disposal-railway and land transport-will Permit. It is stated that 6,000 Sardinian. will be the first to leave, and the Guards will probably be the first English troops to quit the scene of their suffering, of their endurance, and of their glory. Alas ! how many will Eie here till the Judgment-day! Who can tell how many have perished whose lives 'inighthavebeenspared-howmanyanunkno3nvgrave raight have been untenanted, how many a life Wasted,whichought to havebeensaved to the country, to friends, to an honoured old age ! These questions may never be answered, least of all are they likely to be answered at Chelsea Hospital, where the very banners would fall with leaden weight ilpon the he&as of those who shonld speak the truth that is in them. Heaven lets loose all its plagues on those who delight in war, and on those who shed men's blood, even in the holiest cau3se. The pestilence by day and might, the deadly fever, the cholera, dysentery; the incompetence, and stupidity, and apathy of Chieftains; the strategical errors of great captains; culpable inactivity and fatal audacity,-all these follow ln the train of victorious armies, andkill many more than the bullet or the sword. But war has its rules. The bloody profession by which liberty is achieved or crushed-bywhichStates are s3aved or annihilated, Ias certain fixed principIes for its gaidance, and the homceopathic practitioner in the art, or the quack, the charlatan, or the noble amateur, will soon be detected and overwhelmed in the horrors of ruin and defeat. Perhaps on no occasion has theneglect of the course of regular practice been so severely punished, even although inthe end the object has been gained, as in the siege of Sebastopol. It is the first instance on record in which such a place kam been taken by the mere fire of artillery; for It is admitted by the Russians that even if the assault on the M1ala'klhoff had been repelled they must have abandoned a place exposed at every nook and chink and cranny to such a fire that the very heavens seemed to rain shot and shell upon them. We lost an army in establishing that fire, and we have not (notwithstanding the honeyed words of Lord Palnerston, every soldier here feels what I say is the truth)-we have not added to our reputationn1ay, we have not sustained it-in the attacks of the 18th of June and the 8th of September. And will it be said that because the particulars of those conflicts have been made known to the world, and because the daring, the devotion, the gallantry, the heroism of our officers and men have been displayed before its eyea, that the English nation has lost its military 2testige ? Would it have been possible, think you, to have concealed and slurred over our failures? Would it have been better to let the story be told in Russian despatches, in French Moniteurs, in English Gazettes? No; the very dead on CathcartVshillwould bewronged astheylaymute intheir bloody shrouds, and calumny and falsehood would insult -that warrior race, which is not less than Roman, because it, too, has known a Trebia and a Thrasymene. We all feel well that it was- no fault of our officers ormen thtwe dti&not take the Redan,andwe jcan point to the trnhes piled deep with our gallant allies before the Redan of Careening Bay and the Central Bation, .and to the 1Ialakhoff, won without the loss of 200 men, and invoke the goddess Fortune x Alas, she does not always favour the daring; -ahe leaves them sometimes lifeless at the bloodstained embrasure, before the shattered traverse, in the deadly diteh, and she demands, as hostages for -the bestowal of her favours, skill and prudence, as weU as audacity and courage. Every statement made by the Russian officers in ronversation concur;in this-thatwemight have taken Sebastopol in September, 1854; that they were not only prepared to abandon the city to its fate, but that they regarded it as untenable and incapable of -defence, andhad some doubts of their position in the Crimea itself, till our inaction gave Menachikoff Courage, and gave him hopes of an honourable defence, which might enable him to hold us in check, * or to expose us to the attack of overwhelming masses. They admit that their great error was the assumption of a simply defensive attitude after the 'battle of Inkermann, and they now feel that they ought to have renewed the attack upon our enfeebled army, notwithstanding the terrible loss they suffered in that memorable action. It may be mere military fanfaronade on their part to put forward such an -ssertion, but one and all the Russians declare that they could have retaken the Malathoff under the fire of their ships, but that it had been clearly demon-strated since thefire opened on Septemberthe5ththat it would be impossible to hold the south side under the increasing weight and proximity of the bombardment. "It was a veritable butchery, which demoralized our men so far as to make them doubt the chances of continuing the struggle. We lost 3,000 men a-day. No part of the city was safe, except the actual bombproofs in the batteries. We were content to have beaten the English at the Redan, to have repulsed the French at the Bastion of Careening Bay (the Little Redan), the Gervais Battery, and the Bastion Centrale, and to leave them the credit of surprising the Mlalakhoff; but, even had we held it, we must soon have retired to the north side, and we had been preparing for that contingency for some days." Such was the speech of one of their Staff to an officer of high rankl inour service. There is a long song on the incidents of the war very popular in the Russian camp, in which Prince Menschikoff is exposed to some ridicule, and the allies to severe sarcasm. Menschikoffis described as lookingout of thewindow of a house in Bakshiserai, and inquiring for news from Sebastopol, and courier after courier arrives and says, " Oh 1 Sebastopol is safe." " And what are the allies doing?"-" Oh! they are breaking down the houses of Balakiava and eating grapes." The same news for a day or two. At last a courier tells him the allies are cutting twigs in the valleys, and that they are digaing great furrows threequarters of a mile from the place, but that they are afraid to approach it, and that the ships have begun to fire on them. " I declare they are going to besiege it," says he, " and, if so, I must defend it." And so he sends for his engineers, and they at first think the allies must be digging for gold, misled by ancient traditions about the mines, but at last they make a reconnaissance and, finding that the allies are really making distant approaches, they say "I Why, we shallhave time to throw up works too," and so they draw up their plans, and Todtleben says " Give me five days and rll mount three guns for their two ;" and Mlenschikoff dances and sings " Ha, ha ! rve saved Sebastopol ! " The Russians were astonished at their own success; above all, they were surprised at the supineness and want of vigilaince among the allies. They tell stories of their stealing in upon our sentries and carrying them off, and of their rushing at night into our trenches, and finding the men asleep in their blankets ; they recount with great glee the capture of a sergeant and five men in daylight, all soiund in slumber (poor wretches, ill fed, ill clad, and worked beyond the endurance of humaii. n nature), in one of the ravines towards Inkermann. Among many stories of the kind which I have heard, one is remarkable. When the attack on Inkermann was projected, it was arranged that one strong column of rne4i, haying crossed the bridge of the Tchernaya, near the head of the harbour, should march along the road which winds up above the Quarries ravine, and which leadv right upon the ground then occupied by Evans's Division, but this was conceived to be the most daring part of the enterpris, " as, no doubt, strong pickets would be posted on that road, and guns commanding the bridge, or raking the road, would be placed behind the wcarps, and these guns would have to be taken, and the pickets and their supports driven in." " Judge of our astonishment when we found no scarps at all and not a single gun on this point. Our General cried, as he gained the level of the plateau without a shot being fired, ' We have them-Sebastopol is saved! "' The bridge over the Tchernaya was not repaired for the passage of men and guns till it was some time past 5 o'clock in the morning of the 5th, and the men did not begin to repair it till after dark on the preceding evening. But, after all, we may have been saved by the very imbecility of our leaders. When the conflict before Sebastopol assumed such gigantic proportions it became the war itself. The armies of Russia were absorbed into it, and perished in detail. Had we taken Sebastopol at the outset, we must, have been prepared, with our smaRl army, to meet those corps darmge which lost tens of thousands in their hasty march to relieve the place, but who, in the event of its capture, wouldhave closed slowlyaround us, and the same incapacity which prevented our reaping the fruits of our cmp-de-main in attempting the Crimean expedition might have led to more serious evils in a protracted campaign in the open field against a numerous and well-handled, if not a daring, enemy. Success has indeed been obtained, but its cost has been great. What is to be said now if much of that cost can be shown to have been a gratuitous outlay of time and money ? To me, next to the graveyards; now verdant oases in the dark plateau, the most melancholy. and significant object isour oldparallel opened against the MIalakhoff, which the French took from us and adopted as the basis of their attack in the spring of 1S55. Any one can, I hope, understand wliat I mean. Here is my diary such as it is:- WDzESD AY. There have been some'unlawful expeditions made by sundry officers, from. the rank of General downwards, across the Tchernaya to Mackenzie's Far3n and the northforts; It-is statedthat passes will not be required for officers, . and there has been a great deal of fraternizing between the Russians and English. General Codringten, accompanied by Admiral Fremantle and Colonel Hardinge, Commandant of Balaldava, proceeded to-day in a steamer towards Yalta, to enjoy the beauties of the coast. M. Androffshy, Aide-de-Camp to General Luders, paid a visit to head-quarters to-day, and rode into Balaldlava and back with General WVindham. On Sunday a high mass will be celebrated by the RLussians at Mlackenzie, after which there will be an open air ball, and many English and French officers have been invited to be present. It s most desirable that our officers on this occasion should be more careful of appearances and pay more attention to their teiue than they appear disposed to do- at; present when they pay visits to the Russian camps. The French offer an example in that respect which we ought not to be too proud to follow, and the Russians are most scrupulous in their dress and demeanour on all occasions of the kind. They converse veryreadilyabout the events of thelatewar, and comment on ourtactics andtheirownwithequalfreedom. One of our officers had a long and interesting conversation with a Russian officer of some rank on the subject of the conduct of the war, aind, as it is worth while to hear the opinions of even ene of the enemy on such a subject, I may be all6wed to repeat his gossip. There were few troops of the line in Sebastopol when we marched upon Balaklava, but there were the crews of the fleet, numbering about 8,000 men, the garrison artillerymen and invalid battalions, and some volunteers, in the place. The Battle of the Alma had produced such an effect on the inhabitants that there seemed to be no chance of offering the allies a resistance, and the fall of the town was regardedas certain. TheRussians,however, meditated a great revenge, and, knowing the weakness of our army and that it could not hold the heights and storm the town at the same time, they intended, according to this officer, to take the very' plateau on which' we are now encamped, and to fall on our troops while we were disorganized by our success, and get them between the fire of; the Russian shipping, of the northern forts, and of the field artillery outside the place. At first they could not understand the flank march to Balaklava, except as a manceuvre to escape the fire of the north forts, and to get at the weak side of the city, and for three or foiur days they waited uncertain what to do, until they learned we were preparing for a siege. It was then-that is, about five days after we appeared beforethe place-thattheycommencedtheir works. Men, women, and children laboured at them with zeal, and for the first time a hope was entertained of saving Sebastopol, or of maintaining the defence till the corps d'arrnae destined for its relief could march down to raise the siege. The same officer further stated that on the 9th of September he was in command of the advanced posts atMackenzie, and that his orders were " to fall back and retire with the guns on the appearance of the enemy in force." He declares that the Russians were astonished at our inacivity, and that they expected a general offensive movement as soon as we had obtained possession of the south side. TEcuRSDmAY. The amicable intercourse between the allies and their late enemy is on the increase. It is stated that the Jews have got up a fund for the deserters of their persuasion from the Russian army, and that both Jewvs and Greeks have deserted, and have been sent to Constantinople. Credeat JTdmts ! One man who came into Balaklava thle other day was observed to be veryanxious about the walls of a new store. On being asked what he was about he confessed he was searching for the site of his house, in the cellar of which he had deposited a good deal of plate and valuables. I fear he had btit a Flemish account of them. The Russian military band (150 strong) at Mackenzie is a great object of attraction. It plays at 4 o'clock every afternoon. At the hymn of "God preserve the Czar," or whatever the eX.act translation of the title may be, to-day all the Russians took off their caps. I could have wished that our officers who were present, and who understood the occasion, had done the same, for immediately afterwards, when the band played "God save the Queen," the Russians uncovered their heads and paid to our national anthem the same mark of respect as they had paid to their own. A Russian officer-a very young man-covered with orders, was pointed' out to some of the officers as one who had never left the Flagstaff Bastion for 11 months. He had been shot through the body, wounded in the head, in the arm, and in the thigh, on different occasions, and had insisted on remaining in the bastion, nor would he permit himself to be removed to hospital. Many of the soldiers wore the Cross of St. George and other orders. What a phenomenon would a British private be with the riband of the C.B. on his breast! The Russians are very anxious to get some of our medals, and there are some stories afloat concerning the cleverness with which some men have sold forins at high prices for Sebastopol medals. There was a very crowded audience at the Fourth Division Theatre this evening to witness a very successful performance of " Little Toddlekins " and " Going to the Derby," in which Captain Erl gaimed a double triumph. Three or four Ruuian officers were present, and they seemed to, enjoy the play amazingly, and to take great interest not only in it, but in some five or six fair Englishwomen, who were visible now and then through the clouds of tobacco smoke, like stars when the ".scud" is fying. FRIAY. The thermometer at 9 o'clock this morning stood at 70 deg. in the shade ! It is now blowing freslhly, or rather hotly, from the south, and the air is sickly and disagreeable. The wind has nearly all the characteristics of a sirocco, but the snow still shines brightly on the distant hill-sides, and covers the summit ledge of Tchatir Dagh. MIany expeditions have been planned. The very top of the mountain I have just named scarcely suffices for the ambition of some of our daring tourists, and the heights of the Alma,theEmpress'sPalace at'Orianda, Prince Woronzoff's grand castle near Yalta, Bakahiserai, and Simpheropol, have been variously combined as points of interest in the excursions which are coming off almost immediately. There are onlytwo drawbacks to the pleasures we anticipate in these invasions of pleasant valleys and high mountain passes, hitherto barred to us by the lance-point of the Cossack. The typhus is described to be raging in the Russian camps, particularly at Bakshiserai and Sinmpheropol, and we have been warned by the Russian officers that it is dangerous to travel in small parties, or to be out after dark in the neighbourhood of the Greek districts. The people of Balaklava, of Karanyi, of Kadikoi, of Eamara, and of Tchorgoun, nearly all of whom are Greeks, are living in great misery at Simpheropol and Bakshiserai, and they naturally regard us as the cause of all their miseries and misfortunes; and so they are likely, it is said, to take pot shots at solitary travellers, and to try and gratify their religious rancour and their sacred love of gold at one discharge. However, this bugbear is not Ekely to deter many from going inside the Russian lnes. Already, some officers have penetrated to Bakshiserai, and have returned with alarming accounts of the price of eatables, drinkables, and accommodation,-porter 20 francs a-bottle, champagne 35 francs a-bottle, dinner and bed a small fortune. There are some very hospitable fellows among the Russian officers, and they give and take invitations to lunch, dinner, and supper very freely. One of our- Generals was up at Mackenzie yesterday, and was asked to stay to tea by a Russian of rank, whose hut he was visiting, but it so happened that_ Madame, who presided at the tea-table, was j present, and she gave such a look at her peccant i spouse when he gave the invitation, and glared so. fiercely at the heretical English, that our General and Staff turned tail and bolted, leaving the Rusk' to the enjoyment of the leoture which Madame Cau. delski would no doubt inflict upon him. Perhaps the poor lady was short of spoons, or trembled fori her stock of sugar. The Muscov runs quite tame through our camps, and is to be found everywhere.. One of their Generals made a great sensation byi driving through the camp in a neat brougham,i drawn by a pair of good steppers, and "worked" by a. servant in very handsome livery, with an extra plush, in similar uniform of laced coat and cockaded hat, behind him. Four. of them went to head-quarters in a drosehky, drawn jby a team of handsome ponies with an escort of Lancers, and sDent some time in looking at the English roads and at the railway works, and in examining the new| town of Balaklava. As one gets accustomed to the Russian face it becomes less displeasing, and there are undeniably many of them who are exceedingly like Englishmen-more so than any- foreigners I have ever seen. When drunk they are- brutisih and stupid-looking, but many of them possess intelligent features, and eyes with an expression of great acuteness and cunning, and they are said to drive very hard bargains with the canteenmen.! As there is nothing doing in camp I intend to proceed on a week's excursion to the banks of the Alma, retracing the course of our march, thence to Simphoropol, Tchatir Dagh, Bakshiserai; and thence to- the south coast, visiting Orianda and Yalta, and re-I turning by Aloupka through the valley of Baidar. The Russians hav-e sent passes to head-quarters, with one of which I have been kindly furnished It is as follows:-" Carte de passe pour les avant postes" (in print), and "General de Service Tchervinsky;" then in Russian, " Allowed to passGeneral, Major," &c., in MS. A great impediment to these little excursions is the condition of the mountain roads, which have been scarped, and have! not yet been repaired, so that it is difficult to get. carts across them, and it is necessary to carry tents.! and provisions for - man and beast, unless one is bound for either of the large towns of the Crimea. - There is nothing which calls for attention or remark! inthe camps. Ourartillery andLandTransportare employed in carrying down guns and shot totheharbour. When the skids are put on going down the declines' the road is severely tested by the weight of the heavy guns, weighing three tons and uipwards, but it stands remarkably well, and that it does so under. such heavy and frequent pressure is the best proof of its excellence. A stone tablet has been let into the solid rock by the roadside at Kadikoi, bearing this inscription:-" This road was made by the, British army, assisted by the Army Works Corps, under the direction of Mr. Doyne, C.E., 1855." 1 am glad to say that the Generals of Division, acting pro-, bably on directions from head-quarters, have given orders forthe properenclosureof thegraveyardsonthe plateau. A high stone wall is being erected around the cemetery at Cathcart's-hill, and admission can only be procured through the gateway, to which there wi:l be a proper door and lock. The interior has been cleaned and cleared of stones and rabbish.- It is to be hoped that the Russians will not tum our tombstones into hearthstones and fireplaces. I am sorry to say that every Russian who goes into Balaklava will see twoof hischurehes somewhat desecrated; the church of Kadikoi is used as a storehouse forbarley, &c., andiscrowdedwith Turkish and Croat labourers; that at Balaklava is used as the medical i storehouse. Mr. Parker, the Chaplain for the Balaklava district, applied for the building, in order that he might celebrate divine service in it, but it was not considered expedient to accede to his re- I quest, and so he has set;to work, and, aided by many friends, has succeeded in constructing on the site of the building first used for the purpose a clean, well-ventilated, and well-arranged place of wor-] ship, with accommodation for nearly twice tho number of people; but he is satisfied that if there were room his congregation would be in- creased at least fourfold. Divine service is perP 'formed on every Sunday in this church, in the; church- up at the hospital above the town, and- on board the steamship Abundance. The Rev. Mr. Unsworth, the Roman Catholic chaplain, has been' removed from the Crimea. It is understood that Dr. Wiseman disapproved the friendly relations which he held with his heretical Church of England brethren. The rev. gentleman was by no means a polemical divine. , There is a secession also among the Sisters of Charity, and it is stated that they are nearly aU going to leave the Crimea to-day in the Cleopatra. The Army Works Corps is on the move homewards. Several hundreds of them have been already embarked, and large sums of money will thus be saved to the country, for the navvies' work in the Crimea is over for ever. The floating factory and workshop attached to the Land Transport Corps will proceed- homewards as soon as the demands for her services cease. - Never has monoy been better employed than in this vessel, the arrangements of which reflect the highest credit on the able and intelligent gen- tleman, Mr. Fraser, who superintended the outfitting and internal economy of the cruiser. ifEe has received but small reward for his trouble; but Colonel M'Murdo and Mr. Doyne unite in their testimony to his activity, usefulness, and zeal, and entertain the same sense of the services rendered by the factory. No intelligence has been received respecting the future destination of the troops, and the officers of each regiment are busy in conjecturing their probable routes fromthe Straits of Gibraltar. The belief among many is that their regiments will go to Canada. The sanitary state of the army continues to be wonderfuL In one, regiment, 700 strong, there were only two men on the sick list early this week ! Returns have been called for, which will show a frightful contrast to this state of things djuing the terrible winter of 1854-5. Ln some regiments of the Light Division, inaddition to the results of sickness, it will be seen from these returns that 20 officers and 700 rank and file have been put hors de combat out of a strength of some 28 officers and 800 rank and file in the course of this camapaign. The Russians admit their losses to have been prodigious, and there can be no question that they have the most unsound and sickly army in Europe. All past campaigns prove the fact. Tne dirty habits of the men may account in some measure for the mortality in their camps.
TURKEY. {The foUlowing appeared in our second edition of yes. terday:-] (FRIOM O OWN OOREPONDFRT.) CONSTAlT'NOPLE, Aram 14. I informed you in my last that the treaty of peace h arrived here, to be ratified by the Sultan. The bearer of it was Afif Bey. As all the articles have been communicated already, either by telegraph or by letter, to the Turkish Government, in order aa they were settled, and as all objecti6ns weremade then, the ratification does not offer'much difficulty; it is more form than anything else. It has been -communicated in exsto to the Council, and the Sultan was to have ratified it on Saturday. For some reason or other, however, the ratification was deferred until to-day, when it is expected to take place. -NTazim Bey, Fuad Pasha's son, is appointed to take the ratified treaty to Paris. The last- week has been conspicu6us for several largefires. OnMonday,just astheSultanwas reviewing the British troops at Scutari, a kiosk of his at 'Kululee was burnt down.' On Friday night a fire broke out in the Sardinian military hospital at Yenikoi. It was a house belonging to Bibesco, the, former Prince of . Wallachia, and built, like most houses on the Bosphorus are, of wood. Thq fire originated in the chimney of the kitchen, and very soon the whole houso was burnt down. There were no sick in it, only offices, the chapel, thedispensary,-and,some officers' quarters. Thanks to speedy assistance, especially from the ships of war, the fire was prevented from spreading, and, with the exception of some stores, nothing was lost.. The week was concluded by. a fire at Fouduklu, which reduced on Saturday night the house inhabited by Admiral Giey io ashes. It.. broke out at midnight in the kiteleii, and, but for a fortunate circumstance, it might have ended fatally for several of the iimates. SirMalcolm WGregor, the Admiral's Flag tieutenant, and ar. Jennings, his secretary,.were playing at-ches in the forme's- room. Mr. Jennings, leang the room, 'perceived. a strong smoLe and smell of buinlng. Alarmed by this circumstance, both went up to the kitchen, and found that-their apprehensionsiwere but too well-founded. Before they could even give the alarm the fire had communicated t6 the ceiling ; the plaster, broken by the heat, fell 4own in pieces, and, a current. being thus establishedc through the illjoined. athz, they. wero- in a moment- ignited, and the whole house was in a -blaze. With the exception of somg plate, Mlrs. 'Grey's dressingcase, and two pictures, nothing could be saved; all the inmates could dowas to save themselves. As soon- ass the fire was perceived from the shps the alarm was given and help sent ;. it was too late to save the house, but it is due to the exertions of the sailors that the fire did not spread. -Accommodation is prepared. for Admiral and Mrs. Grey on board the flagship, the Queen. A curious, but easily explained circumstance, connected with the fires at Constantinople is, that they are nearly always caused by strangers not accustomed to the wooden - houses. *For instance, it has been often observed in Stamboul that nine fires out of ten are caitsed by negro slaves freshly imported; with the inhabitants proper carefulness about fire has become, so to say, a second nature. ArRiL 15. The mail did not go yesterday. The Turkish Government asked that it might be kept back a day in order to send the ratification of the treaty by the steamer. Omar Pasha was married on FHday last to a daughter of Ejafis Pasha, a young lady not quite 15. Two regiments of cavalry have 'been given over to the Contingent at Kutchuk Tchekmedj6. According to letters from Tabriz, Mr. Murray has left that place and gone towards Suleimanieh. His departure took place under the following' circumstances :-The Governor-General of Azerbijan sent him a communication to the effect, that he (the Governor) would like all his. colleagues to go to Teheran to offer his homage to,the Shah on the occasion of the Nerruz, the day on which all Persia, according to an old custom, celebrates the beginning of spring, and that he asked Mr. lulrray to, decide something about his future movements, as - he (the Governor) could not promise him .security after his departure, the population being very much excited against Mr. Murray. The latter answered that he had no communication to make to the Governor on the subject, but he left a few days afterwards. The continuance of the breach with England, and the sending of two British steamers into, the Gulf, have induced the Persians to make - preparations likewise. All the troops of which the Government could dispose were sent off in the direction of Shiraz. An order has been given to throw up intrenchments at Mohaimmera, situate at the mouth of the Euiphrates, and guns and artillerymen have been sent there to serve the new intrenchments. The breach with En,gland has afforded an opportunity for the introduction of a new foreign influence in Persia. American trivellers have come toTeheran, and are very busy in trying to convince the Persian Government that a treaty with the United States would be very useful, especially under the existing circumstances, when the embarrassments with England, a great maritime Power, couild be best counterfalanced by an alliance with another maritime power. A draught of such a treaty is now circulatingin the official world of Teheran, but nothing de-imitive has as yet been concluded. The Persian troops have entered Herat, where they were well received by Youssouf Khan. The latter, it seems, would have willingly dispensed witE them, but the population of Herat was in favour of an occupation by Persian troops, and Youssouf Khan is too new in power to resist the wishes of such troublesome and self-willed people as his loyal sub-. jects are. The apprehensions of a move of Dost Mahomed Khan on Herat are stiUl as lively in Teheran as ever, especiaUy as theWPersians remember, and very probably Dost Mahomed too, that it was not the walit of goodwill, but the scarcity of meanis, which prevented the Persians from supporting the son of Xohundil, of Candahar, against Dostt.lahomed this political news the letts from Periia which I have seen give an account of a scene which happened lately at Teheran, and which seems to show that, however vain the efforts of western travellers may be in search of new chapters of the Arabian .I2ghts at Constantinople and on the Bo1phorus, they might have a chance of meeting with some in Persia. The maternal uncle of the Shah, and Governor-General of MIazinderan, the provinco of Persia bordering the southern shore of the Caspian, has been complaining for the la§t year that his province, instead of enriching hinm, does not even yield enough to cover his expenses as Governor, and he begged, therefore, to be removed from his office. As his written complaints to this effect led to no result he came himself to Teheran to urge the matter on his Royal nephew. The latter, as anxious, it appears, of hearing good stories as the great Haroun al Raschid was,took some trouble in getting all kinds of people to speak out, and curious was the infonnation they gave. One evening, when a great party was assembled at the Palace, the Shah came in with the "wrinUles of thoughtfulness obscuring his lightful coiuntenance'" When asked for the reason of this " world-distressing" state, he answered that he had had a serious dream, in which his guardian angel appeared to him, all resplendent with light aud glory, and told him that he had good news for him, and that if he searched a certain spot in a certain garden of Teheran which belonged to his beloved uncle,thepoor anddistressedGovernorof Mazinderau, hewouldfind a treasurewhich, like allunder-ground treaSures, belonged to the Shah. The courtiers naturally suggested that the guardian angers valuable information ought to be turned to account, and trusty officials were sent to act on his advice. The result was that 300,000 gold pieces were found in the, spot which had been designated in tlle Shahis dream. Curiously enough, and unfortunatelyfor the Governor of Mazinderan, the gold pieces *were all of new date, which upset the Shah's original idea that it was a treasure hidden by infidel guebres in olden times, and he had his uncle thrown into prison for not having given. information of the treasure, and in order to force him to tell where there were other such treasures to be found. - The day before yesterday three French sailing ships of theoline, and a steam and a sailing frigate, all loaded with troops, passed without stopping through 'the Bosphorus. They are supposed to have had the French division from Eupatoria on board. The following deaths took place in the hospitals at Scutari between the 3d and 11th of April Corporal John Noye, Land Transport Corps, phthisis; Corporal George Booth, Laud Transport Corps, rheum. .ch.; Private James Coles, 12th lancers, febris; Piivate Joha Bucldey, Land TranspDrt Corps, gelatio, febris.
, SIGZALS AVAILABLE TO MEN WHO ARE ADBIFT ON WRECKS AT SEA. -TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In DYe Titncs of to-day {Thursday) I have read with /deep interest the fearful sufferings endured by a crew who were drifting about the Atlantic upon the 'wreck of their vesse,. There is the old sad story repeated afresh by them, how, after days of anxious watching, first one vessel and then another were seen to approach hopefully, and then bow each vessel, lik7 its predecessor, passed by withut Inoticing- the low waterlogged wreck in which the sufferers were huddled, almost level 'with the sea, in the far distance. A distressed crew has little means of rigging up an object of ifcientsize to attract the attention of distant ships; but there is one signal, which is often a very practicable one, and 'which seems weeU worthy of a sailor's notice. I do not for a moment suggest its use to the exclusion of any other inethods, but only as a valuable addition to them; and, as the means for making it are simple and accessible, I should think no sailor or passenger should forget them, who, in the moraent of impending disaster, makes a hasty rush down - below deck to secure such light objects as may appear likely to be of servicoto- him when adift on a boat, raft, or wreck upon the wide ocean. All that is wanted is a common looking-glass, even of tha smallest size-a broken bit as large as.. twohalf-crowns will do-and with this he should glitter the rays of the sun towards the ship whose attention he wishes to attract. Even at a distance of ten miles the glitter from a looking-glass no larger than the month of a teacup appears as a radiant and glistering star, and would at once cause many eyes on board ship to be attentively directed upon it. It is a matter of some nicety to direct the glitter from a looking-glass either steadily or accurately; and, as a sort of guide to the degree of accuracy required, I may remark that if such a thing wero possible as that a man could actually. see th. glitter of the looking-glass in his hand agaimst the blue vatiltof the sky, just as he may see it sgainst the:valls or ceiling of his room, that it would in all cases appear to -him to be (within a most trivial degree of difference) ofpreclsely the same size and shape as the sun itself, thongh excesbively inferior in brightness. The plan I use for directing the glitter with a just aim is to cuta small hole 'with a pocket knife in the middle of the board, or, it may be, of thin zinc plate, which forms theback of the looking-glass, and also to scratch away the quicksilver from below it, so as to leave a little round space of clear transparent glass as an eye-hole. Lookilg through this hole, I direct the centre of the glitter as truly as possible by watcling the play of its edge upon some object that m-ay happen to lie on one side or another of a line between the.eye and the person I signal to. Thus, if a boat-was F being rowed in a direction somewhere towards a ship, a man sitting low down in the stem could direct the glitter of his looking-glass by watching its play upon the bows of the boat at the moment when he could just catch sight of' the ship overthem. If a looking-glass beused without first cutting a hole in its back in the way I have mentioned it is necessary to hold it close up under the eye, and to mmake a more careful allowance for the height of the eye above it thana person who has not had a good deal of practice is likely to succeed in accomplishing. Salt water spoils a looldn--glass,and it wouldtherefore be necessaryto wrap it upwel out of harm's way; and, if it were greased thoroughly over its back and edges, it could be carried with stil less risk. Einaly, the mirror could only be used insmoderate and sunshiny weather, but, with these restrictions, I believe it to afford a most valuable signaL. Ohd,ian'lv vams:, 2]'RANCIS GALTON. April24.

It is trae that in 1853,-namely,three years after the dateof the certificate in question, I wrotb to Mr. Gilbertson to inform him (just as stated by Mr. Robertson) that I had detected alum in his bread, but it is false that I ever threatened to expose'him for doing so, my second and last letter to him (Gilbe r) merely expressing a fear that he might have occasion eventua31y to regret the practice. lf yawill do me the favour to insert this letter you will greaty obige, Sir. vour most obedient servant.

The Danubian Provinces are escaping him. He had hardly anticipated that the present and past condition of Italy would find place for discussion in so grave an assembly, or that M.C avour, liberal and courageous as he is, would venture.to obtrude his complaints or his sympathies on the representatives of Austria and Russia. B:e certainly .-.had not dresamtof the exposure whclichwas to mark the closing scene of the Congress, nor was he preparedito hear the grievances of oppressed populathons laid bare with such little ceremony. But least of idi did he expect that the admonitons, the remon1strances, and the warnings of the Sardiian Plenipotentiary would meet with the sympathies of the majority of his auditors. I learn on -undoubted authority that CountBuol nowbitterly regrets he had not brought instructions from Vienna which would allow of hiistaking into consideration the state -of Italy. But the word has gone forth. Naples, the Roman States, and Lombardy-have had their hopes turned to Paris, and Count Buol knows what sometimes follows the loss of all hopes vith the unfortunate. The veriest bigot does not believe in his heart that the Pontifical rule is not execrated in the Legations; none but the lowest-of the lazzaroni will a Mfirn that the King of Naples, who hardly dares to stir from his own palace even to receive the hospitalities of the French Minister, is not hated or despised by his people; and hardly an Austrian is audacious enough to maintain that the populations of Lombardy are one whit more reconciled to the Tedeschi than they were at the contmencement. Right or wrong, the races will iot mingle, and unnmodified oppression is not likely-to make them do so. CountBuolisperfectlyconvinbeiof this; and,ifany doubtremained on his mindwhen he first took his seat at the conference board, the last words' exchanged betweenhim and Count Cavour,'as they parted, must hav completely removedit. Count Buolregrets now that he met the remonstrances-of Md. Cavour in so decided a tone and manner. believes that something might yet be done in favour of the Italian people, and, if the Congress were to begin again, he would probably come with more ample instructions, and he would not much differ from Md. Cavour on the necessity of doing iomethiibg for conciliation. Austria has as yet gaiuedncthixig.

To-day the King starts for Hanover; after a day's stay there he will proceed with the King of Elanover to -Brunswick, to congratulate the reigning Duke on the 25th anniversary of his reign; on the 27th His Majesty proposes to be back in Charlottenburg. The various princes of the Royal family now in Berlin will -also, on the 25th inst., repair to IBrunswick for the same purpose; whetherthe Prince of Prussia will go there from Coblentz seems not to be certain. The various Brunswickers now living here- intend also to celebrate the occasion of their Duke's so-called jubilee by' festivity of some kdnd in Berlin. The marriage of the Princess lIouise of Prussia 'with the Prince Regent of Baden has been again fixed for Septem.- ber, after having been only a few weeks back settled for a much earlier period. A few days back the King communicated to the Royal family and to the company assembled at Court the fact of hLb nephew Prince Friedrich Wilhelm being engaged to the Princess Royal of England. No public notice is to be taken of the event at present. - Orders have been sent to Hohenzollern to .expe clite as much as possible the restoration of the old castle and palace there, inhabited by the anicestors of the present King, as he and the Queen, together with the Empress of Russia, intend to - visit the parent seat of the .Hohenzollern family this summer.

THE NAVAL REVIIETW AS SEEN PROM HER MA JATSTY'S STEAMSHIP HIMAAA YA. TO THE EDITOlR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-We ought to be thanidul that your reporters were fortunate enough not to come withm " the charmed circle of official routine" yesterday; for, if they had, the graphic account of the naval review which graces your columns 4to-day would never have been written. I was less fortr. nate, as it now turns out, though, when I heard that our paternal Government had placed the finest ship in the service at the disposal of us, its unworthy officials, I deemed myself the luckiest of mortals, and looked down upon the efforts of private speculators, with their guinea and twoguinea fares, in supremest contempt. Will you suffer me to tell, in my rough way, how " official routine" contrived to put us into the finest ship in the world, to take us from Southampton to the Nab and back, and yet to make us miss the sight we went to see as completely as if we and the Himalaya had been at Balaklava, instead of in the Solent? We were to have started from Southampton docks at 9 o'clock, and, as the Hiimalaya was obliged to lie off in the river, our thoughtful Government provided steam-tenders to take us to her, with only the proviso that the lords and Commons were to use them first, and we were to go afterwards. Your readers already know how our legislators were late, and they will therefore conclude that we were later. Still, I am ready to admit that we were on board, and our anchor up, before either the Transit or the Perseverance moved from their moorings. About 2 o'clock we came in sigh-, of the fleet, and moved slowly past it, at thedistance of several mailes from the centre of attraction. We were much too far off to tell what was going on, and it was only when, by the aid of a glass, we caught sight of the Queen's yacht standing out towards the " pivot ships" that we knew the review was not done and over. These pivot ships, as your correspondent informs us, were anchored to the north-east, and the Himalaya kept steadily steaming to the south-west, lest her precious freight should receivo damage from the surrounding vessels, and at no time during the day did we approach nearer to the Royal yacht than, I should say, two to three miles. We had afine view of the Culyer cliff, which was just what we did not vwant to see; and then, lest we should be late at our offices next morning, we turnedresolutely round, left Southsea Castle to stand or fall as it might be able, and steamed homewards for our lives. We reached our moorings soon after 6 o'clock, and had plssaat visions of 6 45 trains and 9 30 Waterloo's F destined all of them, alas ! to vanish into "air-thin air." The tenders were ready for us as before, but my lords must be served first, and my lords did not arrive till 7 o'clock or past, and wve luckless offlicials till nearly 10 o'clock;- There we lay. sad to say, In Southampton water, oh! At lasta tug comes in sight. It wil hold perhaps 300 (don't forget the penalty for over crowvding), and there are 1,500 of us panting for land and Waterloo. I wil not attempt to describe how we pushed and screamed and got on board at last. Neither will Ispend imany words in telling how our tag, beinig a native of Portsmouth, did not know the way into the 'Itchen, and so in a fright took to the ground, and kept us there tiU the tide rose and floated us again. Suffice it to say that we landed at last towards 11 o'clock, and found all the other steamers -those I had looked upon with such contempt in the morning-safely in their berths, and looking as if they had been in bed for hours. Such is my tale of official managerment. I ought to add that the arrangements on 'ooa-dwith relation to the refreshments were of the most perfect idnd; but then, you see, they were all under the superintendence of lhc Peninsular and Oriental Company, and that accounts for the seeming contradiction.

TH1E ROYA LinnmARY FOB DISEASES OF THE CIIEST.-Thc anniversary festival of this institution (situate in the City-road, and established in 1814) was held on Thursday. when a party of some 00 gentlemen were regaled at the london Tavern with a sumptuous dinner, provided in especial honour ofthe occasion. The presidential chair was occupiedhby r. Thomas Baring, M.P. The Royal Infirmary has now become an institution of greater importance than ever, for, in consequence of the removal of the City of London Hospital to Victoria IPark, Hackney, it is now the only institution of the kind available to the poor of the vsicinity. We gather from the report that, in conformity wsith the resolution of a general meeting held last year, no patients have recently been received into the house, but that the applications for out-door relief have been, and are, as numerouis and urgent as ever. Upwards of 2,000 were admitted in 1855, of whom a very large proportion have personally reported themselves permaneistly cured and able to resume their former emplo3ments. Of the remainder a great number have derivedypartial relief, and 450 are still under treatment. The number of deaths reported has been nnusually small. The aggregate of those who have participated in the advantages of the charity since its first establishment in 1814 now amnounts to 45,580. The average daily attend. ance is much as usual, varying with the different seasons of the year. The committee further infonn the subscribers that the infirmary makes continual progress in public opinion, and appears to be everywhere well spok-en of. The patients themselves have full confidence in the treatment of the hospital physicians and the attention which they receive from the medical officers, and are -warm in their expressions of gratitude to the subscribers for the benefit they experience. But from this pleasing retrospect the committee turn to one of a different nature, vir,-the inadequacy of their xesources to mect the expenses of their present operations. The committee seriously considered the financial affairs of the liospital last year, and at length concluded that, with respect to out-patients, ' they would progress for one year longer on the same scale as heretofore, and not refuse any fit object who came properly recommended, or, in urgent cases, even without a recomnmendation." The result of such determination has been that at the close of the past year they found that they had exceeded their annnual in. come by 3021. This position of affairs made it necessary to draw upon the reserve fund of the institution, in order to make up the deficiency and liquidate the existing habilties, which they have now done, in the sanguine lsope that better times are approaching, -when the public liberality wil enable them to re-invest the sum which they have been under the painful necessity of w"ithdrawing for the aforesaid purpose. These facts, backed by a powerful appeal fromthe hon. chairman, induced the subscription of about 8001. The arrangements of the festival were in every respect excellent, and the secretary, Mr. R. Smart, spared no pains to promote the festivities of the evening. The musical department was judiciously intrusted to the care of Mr. Francis, assisted by Mr. Benson and Mr. J. L. Hatton. A choice selection was provided forthe occasion. Mr. Higgs acted as toastmaster.

MOgRY-MARKBTand CITYINTELUGENCJ¢. i Frd&y Evening. The English funds eontinue to show greatflatnes, and, -in consequence of the report having gained strength that a new loan is about to be annoiinceda they'have cIosed this evening at a decIine of three-eighths per-cent. Consols for money opened at the last- quotation of yesterday,-namely, 924 to 93. From tbis they receded to 921, whence they rallied until theytouched 93i. A succession of speculative sales were then made, vwhich caused a renewed fall to 92~.to g, at whichthey remained to the official close. After regular hours numerous transactions continued to take place, and the market presented an appearance of general weaknes, there being- finally seLlers at 92g for money, while for the 8th of May the quotation was 921 to i ; Bank Stock left off at 211k to 212k; Reduced, 91j to i; Ntew Three per Cents., 02k; Annuitiea, 30 years, 17 1-16; India Stoc&, 228 to 23Q; India-bonds, 8s. to 3s. discount; and Exchequer-bonds, 98k to J. The Exchequerbill market was depressed by the demand for money consequent upon the amount absorbed yesterday for the last instalment on the lato loan; and the price of the March bills was par, and of- the June 4s. to Is. diseount. The fact that the Bank return, which shows a falliing off of 222,9351. in the bullion and 226,4401. in the reserve of notes, would prove unfavourable was generally apprehended, and had some influence in increasing the dulness manifested in the latter part of the day. In the discount-market to-day a considerable increase of demand was observable, and at the Bank of England the applications for advances were numerous. This state of affairs will, perhaps, soon be relieved by increased Government disbursements from the loan instalment just received, as well as by the delivery of the 350,0001. of gold brought by the Blackwall, which is expected to take place tomorrow, - A strong desire is expressed that if the Governmeat have decided upon the amount of the new loan to be proposed they will make it public as soon as possible. It was generally rumoured in the city this afternoon that the intention is to raise 10,000,000l. in Consols and to fund 5,000,0001. of Exchequer-bills. If this should prove correct, it will be evident that the attempt to preserve secrecy on the point has failed, and that the only safe plan iin such matters is to give them general publicity at the earliest possible moment. Foreign securities were generall heavy, and prices exhibited a further slight decline. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 97i, -S, i, and @ for theaccount; and theFour per Cent. Guaranteed, for the account, were dealt in at 101i. The general transactions comprised-Brazilian MFve per Cents., 100; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents. New, 95; Granada New Active, 38, ex. coupon June, 1853; the Deferred, 7i and 7 ; Mexican, for aocouint, 22-i and i; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 944 and 95i; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 44- and J; the New Deferred, for the aco3unt, 24, 244 23k, and A; and Passive, 71. In the foreign e-xchanges this afternoon the rates remained withoat alteration. The corn-market was firm this morning, the sup. plies of English wvheat being moderate. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows an active business, at a further advance of Ad. to id. per lb. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 74f. 5oc. for money and 74f. 25c. for the end of the mnonth, showing a slight dininution of speculative as compared with money purchases. The Anglesey has arrived fion Port Philip with 51,319 ounces of gold, valued at 205,3001. A full prospectus of the Imperial LombardoVenetian and Central Italian Railway Contpany, the concession for which has been granted to the various firms of the house of Rothschild and other capitalists in Austria, France, Italy, and England, has just been issued. It states that the LombardoVenetianl concession comprises 437 kilometres, constructed by the State, extending from Casarsa to Milan and Como in an uninterrupted line, with the exception of a break of 37 kilometres between Bergamo and Monza. Also, 355 kilometres to be constracted by the company, whvich include the above link between Bergamo and Monza, a line to connect Casarsa with the 'Dieste and Vienna Railways, and a direct communication from Novara, on the Sardinian frontier, rid MIilan and Lodi, -to Piacenza. There will also .Ie connecting links between Milan and Sesto Calende, on Lake Maggiore, and Mlilan and Pavia. Of the lines already constructed the company are to take possession any tinme before the beginning of next year, and they are to be worked on account of the company from the Ist of next month. The capital required for the purchase and construction of the whole is 6,000,000l., of which the London amount apportioned to B3aron Lionel de Rothschild and Messrs. Laing and tUzielli is understood to be 1,200,0001. The concession is for 90 years, with a guarantee from Austria of 5 2-IOthb per cent. for interest and a(tuw-tissemefnt. The Central Italian concession is to comprise a continuation line from Piacenza, vid Parma. Reggio, Modena, and Bologna, to Pistoja, where a junction will be formed with the Tuscan railways to Florence and Leghorn. This concession comprises 280 kilometres, and is to be met by an issue of obligations, carrying a guarantee from Austria equal to more than 7 per cent. These obligations are to be nominally of 500f. each, but are to be issued at 270f., with 15f. per annum interest from the 1st of May (equal to 5 . per cent.), and are to be reimbursable at par by annual drawings spread over 90 years. One oblition is to be allotted with every two shares. the amount to be paid on the 201. shares is 61., and no further call is expected for a year or a year and a-half. The payment to the wAstrian Government for the existing railways is to be made by an instalment of 666,0001. in three months after taking possession, and five yearly instalments of 333,0001. from that date withoult interes. An additionai 1,000,0001. is also to be paid after the end of that term out of half the net profits exceeding 7 per cent. Even the present unconnected seetions nowv at work are yielding enough to insure a comparatively high dlividend on the small amount of capital to be expended on them during the first years, and the greatest confidence is expressed as to the results to be looked for when the various routes shall be completed, bringing the whole system into connexion with Vienna, Munich, Florence, Leghorn, Turin,. and Genoa. The entire system of the company will consist of 284 miles of existing railway and of 3983 miles of new railway, making in all 682 miles. At the meeting of the Royal SwedishRailway, heldc to-day, Mr. J. Rthodes presiding, the report of the committee of investigation (an abstract of which has been given in Tne Ti-ames) was received, and a new body of-directors was appointed. The shareholders, however, declined to pass resolutions authorizing the issue of preference stock at the rate of 7 per cent. for five years, and afterwards to bear 6 per cent., to raise the 350,0001. which it is stated wvill be necessary to complete the line, until they shall have had time to digest the contents of the document presented, and a short adjournment, after some discussion, was consequently agreed to. It appears to be considered that the undertaking may be resuscitated, and that, if the Swedish G(o- veiment can he induced to restore its lost privileges, there is a prospect of all classes of proprietors eventually deriving benefit. The geographical position of the railway, its relation to various other lines in course of formation, and the encouragement aforded by the native population to the introduction of this species of communication encourage a belief that the traffic will be large and remunerative. As it was intimated that only about 50,0001. will be required to carry out the first section, it was suggested that the better plan will be to raise a limited amoiut, so that advantage may be hereafter taken of an easier state of the money-market. It was, however, explained that the claims of creditors must lik-ewise be settled, the whole of which have bitherto been forborne to suit the convenience of the company. The frauds of the late M1Vr. J. Sadleir and the negligence of his colleagues re- ceived general condemnation; but the debate was principaly directed to the measures proposed for restoring the property to a more favourable positiOn. Ln the colonial produce-markets during the -week the transactions have been on an- average scale at occasionally higher rates. Coffee was in better demand, chiefly for home use, and the plantation Ceylon kinds realized very full terms, the coloury descriptions being still in most favour, owing to their scarcity. The native kinds of geod and superior quality have also gone off favourably, the common sorts being neglected. Nothing is reported afloat; but cargoes of St. Domingo are in good re- quest. I anv pamela of Mocha lately put up to sale have been disposed of at full quotations. Sugar is in increasing request, and a good business has taken place at an improvement of 6d. to Is. per cwt. Exporters have operated to a' large extent~, and the chief portion of the Mlauritins of fered today was taken by them. The home trade are likewise maidng increased purchases, while specutlators in SOMe mnstances have also come forward, Privately a cargo of brown Baia has been reportedfor -ottenberg, and several parcels of Havannah and Mlanilla at very full rates. There has been no disposition to purchase' tea, the market for which still wears an extremely dull appearance. 1,9000 packages of the Assamn Company'sgrowth are advertised for public sale on Wednesday. Rice has been very quiet, but latelv thereis more inquiry, and the market is better. A cargo of Arracan has been rcld for a near port at an advance on the price paid a short time since; and' also two floating parcels of 1'engal. The fine refractions of saltpetre are stiU almost unsaleable, and at public auction a parcel has been bought in at a decline of 2s. per cwt. from the late highest point without finding a buyer. Of pice there have been large sales, and nutmegs are about 2d; per lb. lower. The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 19th of April gives the following results when compared-with the previous wee;:- Public deposits ... .£2,958,753 ... Decrease £484,383 Otherdeposits ... ... 11,907,623 ...Decreasa 407,078 Rest ... ... ... 3,167,890.. Incresse 11,145 On the other side of the account : Government secuaities ... 3,17,833 ...

Admiral de la Gravi-re returned thanks, and proposed a toast to the health of the English Army and Navy. In doing so, the gallant admiral eulogized the conduct of - the English navy, and said tbat, althoiugh the wvar just ended had not been a maritime war, yet that the sailors enqaged in it had everywhere done their . duty. Both in the Baltic and in the Black Sea the naval force of England and France had performed their - duty in such a -manner as to insure for themselves an honourable place in the.annals of that memorable war, and - at the same time perpetuate the recolection of the union of -the two flags. The.navy-had always been ready to perforn anything that had been required of it.

I OoTURT OF OUEQ"S BENCH. W.EsTnnER. ARm 25. PoxAVT.xF-q v- irVbipi (Sttings in Banco, befeme Lord CAZiU'BELL and Juslccs WIGUTMA:. E2RLE. and CROMPTON.) This was an action in which the plaintiff souglht to recover damages fromu the defendant, who was a cab proprietor, to recover the value of certain goods which had been lost from the cab in which the plaintiff was riding, by the negligence of the driver. At the trial, which took place some time since before Lord Campbell, the plaintiff obtained a verdict, the question being reserved for the opinion of the Court whether, iunder the circumstances of tie case, the action could be maintained. It appeared that the cab-driver was in the habit of depositing his license with the cab proprietor, and, on taking out the cab in the morning, he paid the proprietor 14s. 6Gd. for the day's use of the cab and two horses. The proprietor fed the horses, but he exercised no control over the driver, and the latter put in his own pocket all he earnt beyond the sunm which he paid the proprietor. The c1uestion was whether the driver was the servant of the propnetor, so as to render the latter answerable for the driver's negligence. The question was argued on the 17th inst., on a rule to enter a nonsuit, by Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and' Mr. Holland for the plaintiff and Mr. H. Hill, Q. C., for the defendant, the Court having taken tinc to consider. Lord C,uisBELL now delivered the judgment of the Court in favour of plaintiff. The question was whether the driver of the cab could be considered, under the circumstances, as the servant of the proprietor, so as to render the latter responsible for the driver's netiigence. If the driver had been paid by wages, there couldlhave been no doubt on the subject; butthe Court were of opinion that the mode in which the driver in this case was remunerated made no difference. The cab-driver must be considered as the servant of the proprietor, with authority to enterinto contracts on his behalf. The proprietor received what was considered as the average earnings of the cab, after deducting a reasonable sum for the remuneration of the driver. In order to stimulate the driver's zeal and industry, he was allowved to pocket aU be- yond the sum tobe paid to the proprietor, and that excess. would of course vary according to the season of the year. The parties niust be considered as employer and employed,as master an,d sernant,-and therefore there would be a remedy against the proprietor. The 20th section of the 1st and 2d William 0T., c. 24, enacted that every hackney-carriage should have upon it a plate containing the Christian name and surname of the proprietor, and on thecab in question when hired by the plaintiff there was a plate containing the defendant's Ch n name and sirname, as required by the act. A cab proprietor who applied for a license must be considered as holding himself out to the world as the proprietor, and the driver as his servant. The 6th and 7th Victoria, c. 86, was to the same effect, and showed that the driver was the servant of the proprietor. It would be most inconvenient and injurious to tthe pnblic if an action brought against the person who declares himself the proprietor, and wvas so in fact, could be defeated by a secret agreement as to the mode in which the driver was to be remunerated and the mode in which the earnings were to be divided. The Court had examined all the autlorities on the subject, but, as none of them conflicted with the view now taken of the case, it was unnecessary to notice them. The judgment of the Court must be for the plaintiff. DUNBAR V. SMURTHWAITE. In this case a rule had been granted for a new trial, upon the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict which had been found for the defendant was against the evidence. Mr. Watson, Q.C., MEr.BoviLl, Q.C., and Mr. Honyman had been heard yesterday to showv causc against the rule. Sir F. Thesiger had also been heard in its support, and was to be followed by MrIL 3. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn; but at the sitting of the Court this morning, L ord CAMPBELL said the Court was of opinion that the rule should be made absolute for a new trial, but that the counts in the declaration, on an implied promise that the defendant's ship should remain of the class "red diphthong," should be struck ont. His Lordship added, that he should be glad if the counts which charged fraud and misrepresentation should also be struck out, and the question at the new trial confined to the substantial issue whether the ship was seaworthy at the commencement of the voyage. Mr. BOVmLL, Q.C., said he would communicate his Lordship's suggestion to the plaintiff's counsel. Iule atsolute. NALLIABiD V. YOUNG. This case came before the Court upon demurrer. The defendant demurred to the declaration, and the plaintiff demurred to the defendant's plea. Unider these circumstances the counsel for both parties claimed the right to b ein. Itappeared that the Common Pleas and Exchequer had decided that the partywho demurred first shouldbegin, but this Court had decided that where there were cross demurrers the plaintiff should begin. Lord CAMIPBELL said, that, according to the last decision, t'neplanItiff was to be . tr. H. EIL1, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Quain), proceeded to argue in support of the declaration. The action was on a policy of insurance against an underwriter. The declaration set out a charter-party, dated the 9th of August, 1853, whereby the ship Lady Bulwer was chartered to proceed from New York to Quebec, there to take in a cargo of timber. The declaration then set out a correspondence which had taken place between the plaintiff and his broker, respecting the insurance, and wbich it was alleged was shown to the defendant, the underwriter, with whom an insurance for 1,COOL. was effect-ed on the 9th of November, pan profits upon cargo, beginning the adventure on the loading of the goods on board the ship. It also alleged that the vessel was lost before it arrived at Quebec, whereby the plaintiff had lost his profit. The defendant pleaded a plea which his counsel said he should abandon. Two questions were theli raised,-first, whether the plaintiff had an insurable interest; and, secondly, whether that initerest was covered by the policy. The learned coinsel argued in favour of the affirmative. MRr. J. WILDE, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Blackburn), was heard for the defendant, in favour of the negative proposition. Lord CA-irnEL.L said the Court thought the case was very similar to that of " 'Swiney v. the Royal-Exchange A.ssurance Company," but they would take time to consider their decinon. BAIL COlURT.

Mellor and 'Ir Beasloy appeared for the plaintiff, and -Mr. Knowles and Mr. J. Brown were counsel for the defondant. It appeared that the plaintiff, a cabman, had taken up .a :gentlenian in St. Clement Danies Chlurchyard on the even- ing of the 9th of Angnst last, and drove him up Gray's-inn-I lane.

(Sittings at Nisi Pi-lts, at Westminster, beforc Arr. .Tzstfcc WILsLAMS and a Common Jury.) EDWARDS ANSD WIFE V. CRIDLAN. Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Powel1 appeared for the plaintiffs. and Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., was counsel for the defendant. This was an action brought to recover damages for injulries sustained by the female plaintiff under the following circumstances:-On the day in question Mrs. Edwards was waLlkng on the pavement in Westbourne-terrace, Hyde Park, when the cart of the defendant, who is a butcher, was being driven in the same direction as that in which she was proceeding by a young man named Jacobs. The cart was somewhat heavily laden with meat, and the driver was sitting partly on the front seat and partly, as he himself described it, "astride of a leg of bee£" Mrs Edwards sawv it approaching, and at the moment wvhen it was passin her horse, cart, and meat fell almost upon her, thrust her against the balustrades whichbound the footway, and by these means she was considerably injured. She was taken into the house of a Mrs. Stanley oppcsite, close to whose residence the occurrence took place, where she received the kindest treatment, and eventually was enabled to walk holmle, but subsequently it was ascertained that one or two of her ribs were broken. She was attended principally by a surgeon's assistant, and eventually recovered to a certain extent from the effects of the accident. She now sought to recover compensation fromr r. Cridlan for the alleged negligence of his servant Jacobs, and it was also urged that the horse had been sent out with a tight collar, which choked him, caused him to stumble, aud rendered himn less able torecover his legs, when he made a false step; and that this might have contributed to the occurrence previously described. For the defence it was contended that the accident was wholly unavoidable; that there was negligence on neither side; and thatthe plaintiff herself had repeatedly said that the driver Jacobs (who, it appeared, had behaved throu 'bout with great humanity, had called several times upon Or. and Mrs. Edwvards, and offered them compensation out of his own pocket to the extent wvhich his means would permit) was not to blame; that the horse stumbled first as hewas passing Mrs. Edwards; *that the driver was unable to pull him up, and that he fell on to the footway, pressed her against the balustrades, and so caused the injury complained of. The trial of this cause occupied the whole of the day, and the jury, after having retired for some time, found a verdict for the defen dant.
ADrRATTV c()TnR.Tn 'Prniv APPTT. 9 'rr.' NA PflT.rnv TTr. >- (T.TCT (Before Dr. LTUSUDMTON.) This was an action brought by the fishing smack Good Intent against the ship Napoleon II. to recover for a total loss occasioned by a collision between them about 14 miles from the Start Point at 6 p.m. on the 17th of December last. The smack'was engaged in fishing, with her trawl down, when she observed the light of the Napoleon IIL distant aboutthlree miles, whereupon a flare-up was lighted, and, as she stated, kept burning over the larboard quart-er, exce t for an instant, when it was heldunder the bulwarks, wice were not two feet high, until the collision. The Napoleon m. continued to approach her, and was loudly bailed to starboard her hein, but she paid no attention to it, and ran into the smack, in consequenco of which she almost immediately sank, and one man was drowned. The Napoleon II., of the burden of 7S0 tons, was bound from Calcutta to London, and, as she alleged, the atmosphere was thick and hazy. She saw the light on board the smack, and immediately ported her helm, but the light disappearing she concluded that the smack had passed to windward. It suddenly reappeared, when she was distant only from 100 to 200 yards, and the helm was again ported, but it was too late to avoid the collision. She attributed the accident to the smack discontinuing to exhibit her light. Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss were heard for the smackthe Admiralty-Advocate and Dr. Deane for the Napeleon IIL The learned JUD(GE inquired of the Elder Brethren, by whlom he was assisted, which of the vessels r-as to blame. The ELDER BRETEREN impated the fault solely to the Napoleon III. The COURT pronounced accordingly. THE ZOLLVEREN.-coLLTrsros-. This was an action brought by the Pet against the Zallverein to recover the loss arising from a collision between them on the 12th of November last, off Flamborough Hlead. The case was heard on Saturday last, the Court being assisted by Elder Brethren of the Trinity Corporation, who were of opinion that the Zolverein v.was to blame for having srailed too close to a vessel in ballast, in consequence of wihich the light of the Pet was obscured. -They were, howiever, of opinion that the collision miRht havecbeen avoided by the Pet porting her hehn, hut added that if t,here had been no act of Parliamemt she would have been justified in keeping her course. A question then arose as to the application of the law to the finding of the Elder Brethren, which came on for discussion to-day. The QUErN's ADVOCATE (with whom was Dr. Deane) now contended that the Pet being an English ship, and the Zollverein a foreign vessel, the case must be decided by the lexfori-; that it was the duty of the Pet, under the Merchant Shipping Act, to port her helm, and that, not haNing done so, she could not recover. Dr. ADDnMIS (with whom was Dr. Twiss) submitted, on the contrary, that the case must be governed by the general maritime law, under which the Pet was not bound to port her helm, and that, as she had not been found to be absolutely in fault, she was not barred from her remedy. The learned JUDGE was of opinion that, under the circumstances, the general maritime law must prevail. It was incompetent to the British Legislature to say that a foreign vessel should on the high seas be bound by the Merchant Shipping Act. He must pronounce in favour of the Pet.

Re b- ked for omne years with our hoIme. jle 9ccasiquelty qpplitd to have h.it unaoe"t over- drzLwn for 200L or 300L I permitted him to do so onseveral occasions. I remember the fadt-of his stopping payment. On the 31st of MLay ie ceased to pay any more for hin, and we never saw orheardof himafterwArds. He had notour authority to overdraw to the extent of 5504 on the 30th 'or May last.. Cross-exained by Mr. Humnireys, jun.-I thiak'-he never applied to overdraw a larger sum than 2001 ai 300C We did not give: hit: authorityvto overdraw a 'gersum than 2001. or 3001. We did not give him autb.,Oity to overdraw in May either one way or the other. T do not reaemIer his calling at the bauk to gay that t,ome of his checks vwere dishonoured, nor didi -ty it was a mistake. 'He paid insom6moneyon the 31st of y-,which reduced the balance to about 400. I: am. not aware that we gave the defendant any notice at all, but concluded, flom the state of his account, that he v'ould not attempt to draw on us. A paper was pt-euced, which was as follows _ "i Messrs. Specner and Co. inform Mr. Averybhis account is now 4011. overdrawn; he will take care no checks are preseated whiue the account is in this state. "127, Gracechurch-street, June 1,1855." Ie-exasmined.-On many former occasions wherl we allowed him to overdraw (except the 5501) he has applied for lsave to do so. Generally our customers apply to us to overdraw; unless he had been so generally known we should not have given himt permission to overdra more thau 2001or 3001., and the overdrawieng to the amount of 5001. as entirely a mistal;e on our part, which I cannot 'account for. Had it not been an error-on our partthechecksbeyond 3SOO. would have been returned. Cross examined.-The account had not been overdrawn some weeks before, except to a trilfing amount; if it had been it w%as repaid within a day or two following. GeorgeAlfred Martin said,-I reside at Woodbine-cotage, West-street, Hackney, and am clerk to Godby aud Boyd, sugar refiners. I know the defendant. On the 4th.of May last he bought five puncheons of treacle of our house, value 461. They were bought for 'money on delivery, and on the 31st of May he applied to me persona21y for the delivery of the goods. He was told in my presence that he could have them on payment of the money, not without. He replied that he was surely safe for a little time, and he would give us a check on the following Saturday; and then he said he vould give us a check on that day, dated the following Saturav, if we would deliver themn, and he gave the check preduced for 461. 3s. 7d., dated 2d of June, 1855, -with his signature, and part of the goods was delivered on the 31st of Ma.y, and the remainder on the 2d of June. The check wFas paid in to our bankers en the 2d of June, and was returned dishonioured. Cross exauidned for the defendant.-Twvo puncheons were delivered on the 31st of May, andthree others on the 2d day of June. *Helnry Peckson said,-I am warehouseman to James Godby and 1 obert Andrew Hoyd, of Denmark-street, St. George's-us-the-East, sugar refiners. The order produced for five puncheous of treacle was handed to me, and I delivered tv-o puncheons of treacle on the 31st of May upon the order, and three psucheons on the 2d of June. 1 delivered thei,i to Alcock and Co.'s van, William Forbes Marshall said,-I am a commission agent, 59, Co unercial Sale-rooms; I know the defendanit. On the 31st of May he asked me if I could give 1im any assistance forthat day. I told him Ihad a check on the Clonmel bank for 371. lSs. 9d. He asked me to exchange it for one of his own, to bear date the following day, and I agreed to do so, and agreed not to pay it in until the 2d of Jume, at his request. He afterwards sent his clerk, Mr. Challis, with the clheck produced, and I gave him (Challis) the check on the Cloinuel bank. The check I received from Challis is in the defenidant's handwriting; it was returned to me unpaid. Cross-exasmined by Mr. Humihreys (for the defendant.) -We had a good many transactions with the defendant. It was not unusual for us to exchange checks. ro-examined.-But it was unusual for his checks to be returned unpaid. Charles Bird Kellam said-I am a colonial broker, and carry on business in Miicing-lane. I received from the last witness on the 2d ofJulie the check produced for 37Z. 1Ss. 9d., purpotigt' tobe drawil by the defendant. I paid it to my bankers, and it was returned dishonoured. Cross-examined by Mr. Humphreys.-I have had transactionis with the defendant. Ihave never had a retarned check from him to my knowledge. John Checquetts said,-I am a clerk to Mr. Commlissioner GoGlhurn of tie Court of Bankruptcy, Basinghall-street. I produce the proceedings in the defendant's bankrupt-y, and the balance-shlect, 'which shows a deficiency on the ist of January, 1854, of 2,5861. los. 4d. The prisoner said-I am entirely innocent of the offence, and leave my case in the Eiands of my solicitors. Sir R. W. Ca-- DEN said he would accept bail for the appearance of the l;lisoner atthe Central Cniminal Court, and securities were iimnediately tendered and accepted. Some points of law were reserved by Mr. Humphreys connected swith the complicated evidence produced in the three cases particularized. The prisoner, it is proper to state, had been bailed upon each of the examinations, and no oljection was made upon the part of the assignees to the proposition that bail should be taken. In the course of the day twvo distressing cases occurred, one imnuediately after thle other. The father of a boy, who was charged with having robbed his master was caUed into the witness-box, and upon hearing the accusation dropped senseless upon the grouud; and the wife of an unfortunate man, who was comnuLitted for trial for robbing his employer, was so dreadfully affected that she appeared for a considerable time to be totally destitute of reason. She was attended immediately by a inedical man, who directed that she should be at once removed to her wretched home in a cab, and put to bed. The poor creature had, it 'vas afterwards ascertained, miscarried on Saturday last. The active humanity of Mr. Henry Sewell, who was present upon the two occasions, was most serviceable to both sufferers. MARLB0oRotlT-.STIEET.--Kate CoUins was brought before Mr. BLSGH.AIc for final examination, charged with stealing a quantityof wearing apparel, belonging to the Rev. U pton Richards and others, proprietors of the Sisters of Mercy Institation, 67, Mortimer-street. Brownlow Byror, who described herself as the Lady Superior of All Saints' Home, and appeared in a peculiar costume, gave her evidence in thestyleknown as "intoning." She stated that the prisoner was taken into thn Saints' Home as a destitute person, and left on the 12th of this month. Immediately afterthe prisoner had left several gowns and shawls were aiissed. The six gowvns and three shawls produced, worth 31., were the property of the Rev. Upton Richards and others. Two pawnbrokers proved that the property was pledged by the prisoner. The prisoner pleaded "Guilty," and was committed for three months. CLEnrEWN7LL.-Thomas Pincott, 49, of 12, Thornhillplace, Somers-towvn, a cabdriver, badge N. 10,591, was placed at the bar before -Mr TYP~nXvInr, charged at the inst.ance of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animais with cruelly iUusing and torturing a horse, under the following citciumstances: It appeared from the evidence of Mr. Thomas, of 14, Upper King-street, and of one of the society's officers named Seamuan, that on Thursday morning, as they were proceeding dowvn Tavistock-street. Tavistock-square, they saw the defendant driving a horse in a mostexhausted state, and beating and flogging it in a very cruel and most unmerciful manner. Re cut it with the whip under the flanks several times, and, onanother man comiing up, he got him to beat the poor animal across the chest. The horse was dead beat, and could not' get along. The whip with which the defendant beat the horse vas produced in conrt, and was covered with blood, The defendant said he beat the horse because it would not go. Mr. TYsRAwrcr having stepped outside and examined the horse, which was cut about an a most shameful manner, and the master of the horse having stated that it was not cut so when it was sent out on the previous evening, the worthy magistrate said,-I will not stop to waste words on such a dastardly, cruel, hard-hearted, brutal fellowv as you. A man who coulid cut a well-bred horse about like that I have witnessed can have nio feelings of humanitv about hini at all, for it is well known that a horse with such blood in it wil go without whipping to the last. You will go for three calendar months vith hard labour, and not a day less. I am determined to let such fellows as you know that the act of Parliament will at least be put in force against some of you. The prisoner was then removed, apparently rather surprised at the decision. LAnxssB.-Sophia Beckett, an exceedingly good-looking young woman, was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. C. NORTON on a charge of deserting her child, and leaving it on the counter of Mlr. James Mullett, a master baker, at No. 7, Clarence-place, Clapham-road, Brixton. I Mr1. Mullett deposed that he had been summoned before the magistrates at Worship-street by the defendant to show cause why an order should not be made on him for the maintenance of her illegitiinate child; and on the day before, after it had been adiourned once or tVwice, it was dismissed. In the course of the evening, hon-ever, the prisoner presented hie-self at his shop in Brixton, and, having p laced her infant on the counter, walked away. He followed her, and, having met a constable, he desired him to datain her w;hile he went to the station-house for advice. The prisoner followed him there, and the sergeant on duty took the charge against her. 'The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said that her comn plaint bad been discharged in the absence of important witnesses in her favour, and, having not a friend in the world, and feelin" conscious that Mfr. lMullett was the father of her child, and'bein6 also without a shilling to provide for her infant and herself, she made up her mnind to take the child to its father. In doing so, it was not, she said, her intention to desert her infant, but rather that she might be given into custody and have justice done her. A number of respectable persons inthe court, who seemed t) take an interest in the case, assured the magistrate that the young woman had been most unjustly treated, for that even the complainant's 'wife had at WVorship-street declared she sincerely felt for her. The prisoner said that, if Mrs. Mullettconldbe examined, slhe could fully prove her case, as she had witnessed her husband's iplnroper conduct towards her. Besides this, a m edical gentleman who had been called as a witness had expressed his intention to see justice done to her. Mir. N2ORTON felt satisfied that, if she could only show iust cause that they should do so. the magistrates at v orship-street would rehear the case, and decide it on its mnerits. The prisoner said she should endeavour to get this done, and, having promised not to desert her child again, sne was discharged. , [Advertisement.I-Part I., price 7d., of the re-issue of the great edlucationa work, "* CAssel's Popular Educator," will be reade wi.n tic .ay 'magazines.
