THE CRIMEAN BOARD OF INQUIRY. At the meeting of the Board of General Officers, at Chelsea yesterday, Colonel Tulloch's examination by lord lucan was resumed. In answer to a question put to him on a former occasion witness had stated-" But I should think itis very probable that an inquiry may take place hereafter into the very circumstances which Lord Lucan now refers to. I fancy that Her Majesty's Government would like to know which of their officers have been guilty of ' want of promptitude or ingenuity."' He had no reason for supposing that it was the intention of the Government to institute any further inquiry, except from a mere opinion of his own. Had stated that there were two subjects omitted from his report-one relating to the mortality of troops, and the other to the details of duty performed by the infantry. Into those subjects the commissioners had perhaps no right to inquire, and the information collected with regard to thlem, having been omitted from the report, remained the private property of Sir Jolm M'Neill and himself. WhEile in the Crimes the commissioners were not supplied with copies of the evidence taken before theSebastopolCommittee, and the only knowledge they had of that evidence during this time was derived from the public papers. The first time he had seen an official copy of the evidence was upon his return to the War-office. Lord Lucan-When the evidence taken by you in the Crimea differed so materially from that given byme at honue, would it not have been more convenient and more pro er if, instead of ignoring my evidence, you had endeavour.edto reconcile the two 9-f am not aware that I ever saw your lordship's evidence before the Sebastopol Committee while I was m the Crimea. Sometimes I saw newspapers, and sometimes I did not. I cannot tax my memory upon the subject. Have you not stated that you saw an official copy of the evidence upon your return to England, and was not that previous to the drawing up of the report ?-Yes, and I read portions of it. Is the Board to understand that you did not tlhnk it necessary to read my evidence before you drew up the report animadverting on me ?-When a report is drawn up it is founded upon the evidence taken by those who frame it, and not upon evidence taken in another case. W here and howv did you examine witpesses in the Crimea ? -We examined our witnesses at Balaklava onboard a vessel specially appointed for that purpose, and generaUy in the presence of two or three officers belonging to the same regiment. We had-es secretary to take downwhat was said. Unfortunately we had no shorthand writer, in consequence of which we had to condense much of the evidence. Then, in order that there might be no question as to our having taken down the most important points, the evidence was sent to the officers for their revision and signature. Did no more, on those occasions, fel from the witnessesbut what appears in thereport .7-It is quite possible that a great de. more might have fallen from them. The most important part of the evidence was always taken down, and it was then sent to the officers to add to, omit, or make any alterations they thought proper. If we had had a shorthand writer it would have been of very great advantage indeed. Then is the Court to understand that the evidence contained in the report is only so much of what passed as the commissioners thought it right to record .-As the commissioners and the officers thought it right to record, the officers having been told to add anything they thought proper. The witnesses signed their evidence after it was sent to them and after they had read it over for the purpose of revision. In some instances, as in the case, I think, of Colonel Gordon and Dr. Hall, it was rewritten, in consequence of their being a considerable number of alterations. Then the minutes as printed are not a faithful record of all that occurred-of aU that was said by the examiner and the witness?.-I am not aware that the evidence could have been taken in any better form, or in one which would have insured greater faithfulness. I may add that, in many instances the officers brought back the corrected statements and explained the reasons for the alterations they had made. In the evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Lysons, of the 23d Regiment, the following passage occurs:-" On the 22d of February Sir George Brown took command of the Light Division. He ordered me forthwith to supply my men with stocks, pipeclay, and shakoes." The word "stocks" is in italics. Will you state whether that word was underlined in the original manuscript 1-That would rather be a question for the printer, but I presume it must have been underlined, otherwise it would not have been so printed. Is the Court to understand that you received no other instructions from the Minister of War than are contained in your report ?-That would rather be a question for my senior, Sir John M'Neill, than for myself. Sir John M'Neill was in confidential communication with Lord Paninure. I was not. Were you not in the confidence of Sir John MilNeill 7- Certainly I was; but Sir John M'Neill is a much older servant of the Crown than I am; he has been ambassador to a foreign State, and was, I know, in confidential commTunicatkon with Lord Pamnure upon subjects which he did not think it necessary to communicate to me. Had it been intended to inquire into the conduct of the general and other military officers, do you consider that Sir John M'Neill, however distinguished as a civilian, would have been qualified to make such an inquiry ?-That is a question which I can hardly be called upon to answer. There were many questions of opinion with regard to which I was restricted by Lord Lucan himself in examining witnesses, and this is, I think, the last question which I should be extected to reply to. ou consider, if it had been intended to inquire into the conduct of general and other military officers, that your antecedents, experience, and position wouldhave sufficiently qualified you for such an inquiry;* or would you have undertaken it at all?1-Certainly not. I ex-pressed great doubts at the time I w;as sent out whether it was not an undertakin" for which, perhaps, an officer of higher rank should have teen appointed. The JUDGE-ADvoCATE thought this course of inquiry should be discontinued, unless Lord Lucan could connect it in some way with and considered it essential for the proper conduct of his case. Lord Lucan asked if that was the opinion of the Board? The JUDGE ADVOCATE replied in the affirmative. Lord Lucan.-Why did you not examine Lord Raglan himself ?-U9pon that subject Sir John M'Neill and myself had a conversation with Sir Richard Airey (wvho did not, however, remember the circumstance) the tenor of wlhich was that, considering the high position of Lord Raglan, it would not become persons, in my rank particularly, to put any question to his lordship. Another point which induced us to take this course was that throughout our inquiry there had not been one word uttered against Lord R-aglan. Under these circumstances Sir John l'Neill andmyself conceived that we were not called upon to examine his lordship at all; and certainly, had Sir John M'Neill been of a different opinion, I should have written home to Lord Panmure, to request that some other officer-an officer of higher rank than myself-should be appointed to perform that duty. I believe it is not customary-I don't think any such thing has ever occurred-that a commissioner of my rank should inquire into the conduct of a general commanding the army. Late as was your visit to the Crimea, did you ever see any of the cavalry horses of our allies under cover *-I did not ; and the reason was, I understood, that they were most of them stallions, and from their birth were always used to being kept in the open air. That was the explanation we received. Some were under cover, but the majority of the French horses were not. Did you inquire whether the Russian horses in the valley of Inkermann were undercover during the month of November ?-I did not inquire whether they were under cover at that time, but I have every reason to believe they were not. I have been told that even during the very coldest weather they were able to do without cover; but a Russian horse is a very different animal to an English horse, and is accustomed to a very different mode of treatment. Do you conceive that more promptitude and ingenuity in givimg shelter to their horses were displayed by those nations than by ourselves ?-I cannot answer that question. Before I did so, I should require to have the same information as came before me in regard to our own cavalry. Besides, it is a mere matter of opinion, and Lord Luoan repeatedly objected to questions involving opinions being put by me, Are you aware that in very wet weather it is often neces-' tory to change the standing of ow horsea every two or threQ da3 s?-Yes, I am; and if the standing had been changed even oftener, I think it would have been of advantage-that is to say, until some temporary shelter was put up. WYas it possible, under such circumstances, to have our horses standing behind treuches or in pits.7-Certainly, nothing need have prevented it. You would have thrown up trenches round the horses to protect them from the cold, drained off the wet, and then the ground would not have been broken up as it was. The great complaint was, that the horses were knee deep in mud, which froze round them, that they were unable to get up, and died at their pickets. Are you speaking now of what you saw or what you heard 7-Of what I was told by officers. The horses were not picketted at the time I was there. When, in your letter to Lord Panmure of the 16th of February, you annexed extracts from the evidence of Sir Richard Airey and Colonel Gordon to show that I was directed to provide shelter for the horses as early as the Sth of November, and that an engineer officer was appointed to assist me on the 12th; and when you proceeded f- ther to say that no stabling was, however, commenced until very much later, do you not consider that to be a reflection that there had been "a want of promptitude or ingenuity," which cannot be considered otherwise than as an animadversion upon me 7-This is not an animadversion in the report of the commissioners, and as the Board, I think, on referring to the warrant, will not find that the subject of their inquiry includes any subsequent correspondence of Lord Lucan's and the commissioners, I object to answer tho question. Being pressed more closely, Colonel Tulloch said,-I do not see any reflection upon Lord Lucan. The reflection applies to whatever persons ought to have provided temporary shelter. There is no special reference to Lord Lucan; the commissioners only expressed an opinion that temporary shelter ought to have been provided by some one. Lord Lucan said, if the Board thought that an answer to the question, he was satisfied. But, if no animadversion were intended on him, there appeared to be no reason why these extracts should be produced in a letter to Lord Panmiure, answering one written by him to point out the injustice of charging him with a want of promptitude or ingenuity. Colonel Tulloch said, it was not the ordinary course for a commission of this kind to do otherwise than indicate what was open to censure, leaving the Government to find out who were the parties to blaiie. The JUDGE-ADvocATr remarked, that the effect of I Colonel Tulloch's explanation was to show that the commissioners had merely made a general statement, involving no special reference to Lord Lucan, and without fixing the blame on any one. L.ord Lucan.-Did you examine the engineer officer whom you say you were led to suppose Twas assisting me after the 12th of November 7'-The statement made to us by Colonel Gordon was, that an engineer officer had been appointed to assist you, and we of course imagined that such assistaiice had accordingly been rendered. I did not examine that officer, for I did not know who he was. In the appendix it is stated that the timber ships only arrived late in November, and that the timber was only issued in December. When you spoke of a want of promptitude or ingenuity in providing temporary shelter, did it not occur to you that materials were fully as necessary as an engineer officer 7-One mode of providing temporary shelter which suggested itself to me was by digging trenches, and throwing up a little earth besides, so to keep the horses' bodies from the rain. The first cargo of wood arrived, I think, on the 25th of November, m the Cottiugham, which brought 14,431 boards and planks, and 1,699 pieces of scantlng. The date of the order to Lord Lucan was about the 12th of November, and I think it quite possible that he, or the Quartermaster-General, or whoever ought to have attended to this, might have dug trenches, and had everything in readiness in putting up accommodation by the 25th of November. Had you had any experience in trenching for the shelter of horses before you visited the Crimea in the spring 7-You will see the nsame trenches thrown up in the Highlands, and in Switzerland, for the purpose of protecting cattle from the wind and wet. I have heard of the same plan being adopted in the Pampas, where indeed, I believe, it originated. Instead of examining Mr. Rawlinson, a gentleman totaly strange to military affairs, and who only arrived in the Crimea after all the difficulty had passed away, why did you not examine a military engineer who witnessed all these scenes, and who could ea.;ily be found in this country9.- The reason why I examined Mfr. >awlinson was, that he w as sent out by HIer MIajesty's Government for the purpose of ascertaining the capabilities of the country as regarded stabling, the accommodation of trcops, and everything connected with our military establishments. With regard to a military engineer, the Board and Lord ucanhave it in their power to call for any evidence which they may think it desirable to possess. When you remar-ked upon the fearful loss of horses, why did you never allude to the Commissariat transport duties ? Are you of opimon that those duties occasioned no loss of horses .7-I have no doubt that they did occasion a loss of horses, but to nothing like the extent stated. From all the evidence which came before me the extent of those duties seems to have been very much overrated. Were you not much consulted, and did you not take a principal part in the organization of the Ambulance Corps? -Yes I did; but it is necessary- to add that I had nothing to do with the terms upon which they were enga"ed, and 1 cautioned the Government that they were not ilYcely to get proper men for that service for the remuneration they offered. That opinion of mine remains upon record. In your inquirydid you receive evidence as to the existence of the Ambulance Corps at that time ?-I not only received evidence in regard to its existence, but was frequently in communication vwith the officers and men too. Did you consider that this corps formed any p art of your inquiry'i-There waS nothing connected with the corps which seemed to me particularly to call for inquiry. ere you not, duinag the months of November and December, 1854, in constant communication with the Minister of War 7.-To a certain extent Iam alays in communication with him, as being in the same department. Were you able to foresee any difficulties which would have to be contended with by the cavalry if made to winter in the Crimeas -I beg to state that the difficulties of the cavalry formed no part whatever of my duties in the Waroffice. I was never consulted on the subject. Part of my duties did consist in sending out the huts, and I also had something to do with sending out the Ambulance Corps under the orders received from the Minister of War. If canvas shelter was, as you seem to suppose, the shelter affording the most advantages under the circumstances, would it not have been the duty of the civil authorities at home to have placed the proper materials at our disposal?That is a question of opinion again; but I certainly cannot see why the authorities at home should have been written to for canvas when that article was procurable in large quantities at Constantinople. If it was considered proper to send out huts for the men, ought not the authorities at home equaUy to have considered the horses 7-I believe materials were sent out for stabling the horses. If canvass covering would have been sufficient to shelter the horses, would not one or two steamers have been sufficient to have brought out all the materials, canvass, spars, and worlmen 7-They inight have been obtained from Constantinople. It would have been useless to send materials from home, while Constantinople is built of wood and ex-- ports canvass. Are YOU aware that without pavements in the wet season it would he impossible to place1,orses in pits without cover? -Many of the pits in front were paved. The French pits were all paved. Al the pits might have been paved in the course of two or three days. There was plenty of stone in the neighbourhood, which only required blasting, and there was also loose stone. Did you see the sheds which were constructed for the eavalryhorses at Kadikoi 7-I understood they were occupied as hospital stables, and had been constructed by some of the cavalry, assisted by some sappers and miners and carpenters obtained from other parts. The report does not refer to those stables, because the officers upon whose evidence the report is founded did not refer particularly to those huts. Did you ascertain that in the month of November the cavalry were amply supplied with materials, tools, and labour to construct stables before you wrote that paragraph of the report imputing a want of promptitude and ingenuity, to which I take exception?-The only difficulty which I understood the Qnartermaster-General to refer to in regard to labour was as to the Turkish troops, who were not good workmen. I thought that a certain portion of the cavalry would be available for the construction of stabling. I knew there was a deficiency of tools in some regimients, and as to materials, if sailcloth had been used, much more shelter could have been afforded. If I had known that at that time there existed a deficiency of tools, labour, and materials, I do not know that we should have framed our report differently, because in the report we do not say there is any blame attaching to the cavalry. If we had known that such deficiencies existed, we might have been more particular in our reference to some other department. Lord Lucan having stated that he had no other questions to ask, General PEEL referred to a calculation made on a former day by Colonel Tulloch, by which, after taking a monthly average of the number of troop horses alive on the first of each of five months, the witness arrived at the conclusion that the average mortality of horses had been 92 per cent. The gallant general asked if such calculation could he correct, seeingthat, if it had been carried one month further, it would have appeared that a greater number of horses had died than had ever existed in the cavalry division. Colonel Tulloch replied that that was quite possible, and the very circumstance had occurred in a report which he had soene time ago drawn up, showing the mortality among the troops sent to the coast of Africa. In that return the mortalty at the Gambia, calculated upon the basis of monthly averages, showed a total mortality of nearly 200 per cent. There were two modes of calculating losses of this description-the one adopted in the report of maldng an aggregate percentage of the whole number, which gave the nnismum of loss, and of which Lord Lucan had complained; andthat of making monthly statements of the strength and taking averages of the losses upon the reduced number of each month, which gave the maxiasun rate of loss. The percentage of loss, 43 per cent. given in the report, was calcuted upon the aggregate number, and the other calculations of 92 per cent. was based upon the average numbers during five months. He had mentioned this last calculation in order to show that he had- not in the report overstated the loss of the cavalry; and, indeed, throughout their report, the commissioners had been most anxious to avoid al apearance of exaggeration. General BERKELEY asked whether, if the horses had been shifted every two or three days the cover constructed for thens could also have been removed ? Colonel Tulloch said, his observation, as to shifting the animals, referred to the period before any cover had been provided for them. In answer to Lord Lucan, the gallant colonel said, trenches dug in front and rear of the horses would not have interfered with their removal, and would have carried off the water. One man could have dug trenches for one horse in half a day. Lord Lucan would show that the French, who adopted that mode of sheltering their horses, always paved the- bottom of the pits. Colonel Tulech, in correctien of a former statement that cavalry horses were employed in February in carrying provisions, stated that he found in that month that they were only engaged in conveying sick to Balaklava. Major-General Scarlett was then called by Lord Lucan who asked,-were you ever by any act of mine deterred or discouraged in getting shelter for the horses of your ' brigade, or did I not, on the contrary, encourage and urge you and all other officers as far as possible to do so 9-You never discouraged us in any way, but, on the contrary, you were most anxious that the cavale horses should be gots uderoshelter. I rme not aware that, under the circmstances, more could have been done than was done to provide shelter for the horses, or I shonld have felt itto be my duty to suggest it to your lordship. I believe everything was done that ourameans permitted. Ctolonel Douglas, of the llth Hussars, inreply to the same ouestionsid from LordLucin, gave sinilcar answers. Colonel Tulloch referred to this witness's formerevidence to the effect that salcloth would have been a tolerable shelter, and had the materials been at hand could have been put up by his own men. Colonel Tulloch now asked why the witness had not suggested the emplorymet of canvass, as he had admitted its appliabblty 2-Colonel Douglas.- It was my dutZr to act according to circumstances, but I did not consider it necessary to make any such suggestion. I oeleved everybody was doing his bet as far as the circumthtances permietted. Does the omission to make sucha suggestion imply a want of ingenuity orpromptitude on your part-I do notmthink it does; I did not command the cavalry. A s a regimental officer, ltdd not think it was my duty to make a suggestion of that kind. I think the general commanding the cavalry, the brigadier, or even lord Raglan wras the proper person to have considered this point, and that it not was the duty of a colonel of a regiment tp do so at that particular momen.t. The JUoGE-ADVOCATE, on the part of the Board, asked the witness to what causes he attributed the loss of horses not kdlled in action? -Colonel Douglas.-In a great measure to the want of supplies (as far as my regiment was concerned) while in the position behindIlnkermuann; and also that, being very much reduced in condition, the horses were exposed to the weather, which was bad, and required to carry Commissarist supplies to the front. If the horses had been properly fed, they would have been better able to bear General BERxsTxY.-If there had been a sufficiency of forage, would covering have been so necessary9.-I think with the shelter we could have made by digging trenches, tbrowing up breastworks, and paving the bottom, the horses, if they had been properly fed, might have stood out during the whole winter. General Scarlett was recalled, and, upon being asked to what he attributed the loss of horses, gave a reply precisely similar in its import to that of the last witness. Lord Lucan, after stating that he wished to examine several officers who were not then present, proposed to read a letter from Admiral Dundas, in answer to certain queries which he (Lord Lucan) had sent to him, finding that his recent doniestic loss would prevent his attending before the Board. Colonel Tulloch observed, that he would have no opportunity of cross-examining Admiral Dundas, and if the letter were received in evidence he hoped he would be allowed to put in evidence of a similar character, such as returns The Board, however, decided not to receive the letter. Lord Lucan then said he was not prepared with any other witness at that moment, it being inconvenient for Admiral Lyons to attend before Monday. Colonel Tulloch., before the Board adjourned, wished to address to it a few words upon the decision at which it arrived on the previous day in respect to the order of proceeding to reply. He regretted to fid that he was regarded as the prosecutor m this case, a character which he begged most earnestly to repudiate. He was not a prosecutor, and would never have appeared before the Board had it not been for the attack w hich had been made by Lord Lucan upon the correctness of the report. Nothing could be more unpleasant than to find himself placed in his present position, and he had not interfered at all in the inquiry until the fourth day of its proceeding. Instead of being there as prosecutor, he appeared there to defend the correctness of the report, and to give explanations respecting it. He hoped, therefore, the Board would reconsider its decision, and allow him the privilege usually accorded to persons engaged in defending themselves-viz., that Lord Lucan, after concluding his evidence, should sum uip his case, and that then he (Colonel Talloch) should be permitted to make his observations upon the whole evidence. The JUDGE-ADVoCATE was desired by the Board to state that it saw no reason to vary its decision. There was no reference to Colonel Tulloch as a prosecutor, but, after Lord Lucan had opened his case, the gallant colonel, not being summoned, appeared and obtained leave to make statements and to call witnesses. He appeared there rather as a defendant, and the Board, in granting the last reply to Lord Lucan, had adhered as closely as possible to the analagous nractice of other courts. The Board adjourned at a-quarter past 2 until Monday, one of its members, General Knollys, being engaged tomorrow (this day) at Aldershott, bf which camp he has the command.
ADULTERATION OF FOOD COMfMITTEE. TO TfIl EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the report of the evidence given by Mr. Clapper-. ton before the Commnittee on Adulteration, contained in D7i Times of this day, the following remarks occur:- "He had been mentioned in the Laocet as one of the bakers who sold adulterated bread. This statement had entirely ruined his business, and he had been obEged to give it up. To show the falsehood of the charge he wished to state to the committee that he had received a letter from Dr. Hassall exonerating him from it; but, on applying to Mr. Wakley for a portion of the bread said to Lave contained the alum, it was refused, and therefore witness was advisedthatan action could not be sustained. The charge had never been withdrawn, although Dr. Hassali admitted its inaccuracy." As the above evidence is incorrect in many respects, I am compelled to trouble you with the following brief statement of the actual facts of the case:- In 1851 some bread was purchased, in the presence of witnesses, attthe establishment of Mr. Clapperton, in Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square, and, after careful analysis, was reported upon in the Lancet, together with the bread of many ether bakers, to the effect that it contained alum. On this Mr. Clapperton plh-ed himself in communication with Mr. Wakley, by whom he was referred to me. Mr. Clapperton stated that he did not use alum in the manufacture of his bread, and at my request he furnished me with four samples of the flour obtained from as many different millers, and one sample of the salt used by hin. Thesewrere subjectedto analysisbytwo differentchymists,and wo of the flors, the salt, as wellas the bread, were found to contain alum. There beingno inaccuracyintheoriginal statenent, it of couse was not withdrawn. No imputation was thenade,oris now intendedto be made, thatMr. Clapperton used alum in the preparation of his bread; the onlyallegatioii advanced was that the bread contained the substance in question, and necessarily so, since the ingredients of hiCh it was composed themselves contained alum, and to the statement that it did so I still adhere. In placing the various samples in my hands for analysis Mr. Clapperton observed that he felt assured that we would do him full justice; and again, on the result of the analysis being communicated to him, he expressed his entire satisfaction at the mannerin which his case had been investigated. I may here remark that it was made an invariable rule to avoid all personal imputations and to confine the reports as far as possible to simple matters of fact. In corroboration of the above description of what actually transpired I beg to be permitted to quote the following passages from one of the reports on bread published in the Le/ncet: " Since the publication of our last report on ' Bread and Its Adulterations we have csrefully repeated the analyses of the samples of bread purchased of Mr. Clapperton and of Messrs. Davies and Son, at the request of the parties themselves, and we have now to report that those analyses were correct, andthat the bread in each case realy did contain alum, and furnished conclusive evidence of the presence of tbhatsalt. Believing, nevertheless,that the statements of the above parties that they do not knowingly use alum in the manufacture of their bread have been made in good faith, we have thought it right to institute fuher investigations, in order to ascertain whether the presence of alum could not be accounted for without supposing that it had been wilfully introduced into the bread by the bakers. With this view we procured several samples of flour, and submitted them to analysis, with the following results." (Here follow the results.) " Finding, then, alum in the flour aLnd salt used by Mr. Clapperton .... we believe that these circumstances account satisfactorily for the presence of the alum detected in the samples of bread purchased of these parties without supposing that they thlemselves were aware of its introduction. "We thus findthe accuracy of our original analyses confirmed in every particular. " It is due to Mr. Clapperton and to Messrs. Davies and Son to notice the fair and straightforward spirit in which they have acted in the matter ; they waited upon us, placed in our hands samples of the flour and salt used by them in the manufacture of their bread, and left the investigation entirely to ourselves, stating that they felt assured that we should do them full justice." The course now taken by Mr. Clapperton is, surely, somewhat strange, and such as not to entitle him to the approbation of his former conduct expressed in the paragraph above quoted-to come forward with a complaint at this late period, after having allowed the matter to rest for nearly five years, and after having previously declared his complete satisfaction at the course pursued by us. It is also singular that out of the many bakers whose bread was analyzed and found to contain alum Mr. Clapperton should have been the only one to be ruined, and that he should have conducted his business in Mortimer-street until within the last two or three months-that is, for nearly five years after the publication of the statement of which he now comesforward to complain. I regret, Sir, to have to request the insertion of this coninunication, but the evidence of Mr. Clapperton, as reported, ontains such positive and injurious inaccuracies that their correctionbecomes a matter of necessity. I have the honour to remain Vrnm olni,odntrvapnrt ARTHUR HILI HASSALL, M.D. zenneft-Street, St. James's-street, April 17. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On giving my evidence before the committee, in reference to idulteration of food, &c., at the House of Commons, on Vednesday, the lGth of April, your reporter has incorrectly described me as Mr. Robinson, of Judd-street, instead of -"Robertsol," of the firm of Gilbertson and Co., Judd-street.

PARLIAMBYTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, FmiY, Apm 18. The LoRD CHACnELLoR took his seat on the woolsack at TORTURE IN BENGAL. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH said that in the intelligence from India which had been received that morning there was mention of a case of torture in Bengal, in which he was happy to say the person offending had been sentenced to re imprisoned in irons for five years. He did not notice this fact so much for the purpose of contrasting the deserved severity of this punishment with the undue leniency of those inflicted in similar cases in the presidency of -Madras, as to request the noble duke opoosite (Argyll to take care that a letter should be sent to ludia desiring that a full report of the circumstances of this case might be transmitted to this country. The Duke of AXGYLL had not seen the account to hichhis noble friend had referred. He rejoiced at the severity of the punishment which had been infiicted, because we could never be considered free from blame in this matter unless the persons convicted of these offences were effectually punished. He would take care that a full report of the case should be laid on the table. TheEar-l of ELLENBOROUGH might perhaps be allowed to state how his friend Sir Charles Napier dealt with a case which, although not similar to this, was one of great enormity. Slavery had been abolished in Scinde, but as Sir C. Napier was marching throuh that country a man came to him, and informed him that his master still kept him as a slave. Sir C. Napier set for the master, put him in irons, and carriodhim through the country, showing him to the people. THE CO =TTEE ON INDIAN TERRITORIES. The Earl of ALBEMARIE gave notice that he should bring forward his motion for the reappointment of this committee on Monday, the 5th of May; and that, if the committee were granted, he should propose to confine its inquiries to revenue and justice. PETITIONS. The Earl of DERBY presented a petition against the abolition of church-rates without an equivalent. The Earl of EGLT(1TOUN presented petitions against the Maynooth grant, and in favour of the Education BilL The Bishop of OXFORD presented petitions from parishes in Buckinghamashire and Berkshire, against the abolition of hurch-rates without an equivalent; from the clergy of the deanery of Beading, alleging that the law which allows the registrar's certificate to be the ground of marriage had led to a great number of clandestine marriages, and praying for its alteration; from the Board of Council and hon. House of Assembly of the island of St. Vincent and its dependencies, praying their lordsbips to take steps for the relief of West Indian distress; from Fort Willam, for the removal of the disabilities of the Scotch Episcopal clergy; and from the parish of St. Bride's, London, for an amendment of the law against the violation of the Lord's-day. SECONDARY PUNISHM&ENTS. The Marquis of SALISBURY rose to move for copies of all documents and petitions relating to the discharge of certain convicts upon Tickets of leave. He said that this subject had attracted the attention of the House last year, and certain returns were moved for, which were not presented until the present session. Since the commencement of the present iession the nobie earl the President of the Council had, on the occasion of a similar return being moved for, observed that nothing could be done on the subject without an alteration of the law, and that it was not the intention of the Government to make any such alteration. It appeared to him that that observation was rather rashly made, and that the noble earl, being glad to get rid of a disagreeable subject, rather hastSiy answered that he could make no alteration in the present ticket-ofleave system, without a new act of Parliament. The noble earl could not have attentively considered the question, or he would have seen that the system as carried out was very different from the system as first recommended to Parliament. In 1853 the measure was proposed to Parliament, and the noble and learned lord on the woolsack noticed a particular clause, which he recommended to their lordships for adoption, in order to enable the convicts discharged on tickets o0 leave to obtain an honest livelihood. It w3s stated that it was the intention of the Government to establish three grades of probation for the convicts-firstly, I close imprsonaent; secondly, imprisonment and hard labour for a certan period; thirdly, the grant of tickets of leave, eatending either to the whole kingdom or to certain parts thereof. It was also proposed that if the convicts on tickets of leave could not obtain an honest livelihood at large, they were to be employed onpublieworks at low wages ; butthat was a part of the system which had not been carried out. The consequencewasthatmanyofthesemenhadreturned to their old quarters, where they could not obtain an honest living even if they were inclined to work, and this was especially the case in the rural districts. He did not vish to enter into the general question, whether a system of retam- I ing prisoners in this country under any circumstances could be adopted; but his object was to know under what system] [the ticets of leave were granted. It had been said that the accounts of the conduct of these convicts were satisfactory, but he contended that no proper and fair a4counts of their conduct had yet been laid before the public, and his wish was to obtain such accounts. He held in his hand the ticket of leave granted toa convict, in whiclh it was stated that he had been released after a confinement of three years and 11 months (he had been originally sentenced to a lengthened term of transportation), and that his conduct on the publec works during that time had~bee-nery good, but in other confinement very bad. The noble marquis concluded by moving for copies of all documents and petions relating to the discharge of certain convicts upon tckets of leave. The Duke of ARGYLL said that, as the noble marquis had been good enough to furmish him with the names of the convicts on whose cases he relied in support of his own views, he had obtained returns from the Home-office in reference to them, and he should be able to show that none of them bore the interpretation placed on them by the noble marquis. Only two of them had any connexion with the new system adopted under the act of 1853. The first case was that of Henry Austen, convicted at the age of 10 years at the Kent Assizes, and sentenced to penal servitude, with the view of getting him into some reformatory institution. He had been released by the Home Secretary on the representation of persons who took an interest in hun, and wno at the same time gave security for his future good behaviour. The next case was that of William Collins, and in his case there was a misprint in the Parliamentary return. Instead of having been sentenced in 1854, as would agpear from the return, he had been sentenced in 1851, so that, in fact, he had not been released before the time at which convicts sentenced to the same time of transportation usuaUy received their ticket of leave. In the four next cases the prisoners were set free under medical certificate, and under the old system they would have been set free without any letter of license. None of the convicts whose cases had been mentioned to him by the noble marquis had been released before the time at which they were entitled by the established rales to claim their tickets of leave. It did not appear, therefore, that the noble marquis, with all his horror ot the system, had been ableto adduceany verystrong cases in favour of his view of it. Ina few days a report fromiColonelJebb on this subject would be laid before Parliament, and, though it was unusual to refer to a paper which had not been laid on the table, he must say that he had never read a report less likely to excite alarm, or more calculated to allay the mistaken apprehensions which had arisen on this subject. It appeared that in the two years and five months which had elapsed since the commencement of the new system, between 5,000 and 6,0(X convicts had been released on ticket of leave, of whom only 8 per cent had been recommitted. There would be no objection to the production of the papers for which the noble marquis had moved. After a few words from the Marquis of SxmISBURY Earl STANHOPE rose to call the attention of the House to the present state of the law on secondary punishments. He thought that the noble miarquis was justified in moving for these returns, but that the noble duke had shown that their production was unnecessary. The question of tickets of leave could not however be satisfactorily argued without a glance at the whole subject of secondary punishments, and, having during the last 15 years given much consideration to that subject, he rejoiced to find that it had now attracted the earnest attention of the other House. He did not intend to move for a committee, such as that which had been appointed by the other House, but hethought their lordships ought to bave an opporunity of offering any practical suggestions that might have occurred to them upon the subject. He imputed no blame to the present or any preceding administration; errors no doubt had been committed, but no benefit could now be derived from discussing them; they had to consider the question of transportation to New South Wales aud Van Diemen's Land and the operation of the act of 1853, and then to inquire into the evils of the present system and the remedies to be applied to those evils. Tickets of leave were but one feature, and not the most important feature, of the case. The real grievance was that a vast number of prisoners were periodically let out of prison at the expiration of a certain term ofimprisonment, and returned to their evil courses. But that grievance would e.ist if there were nO tickets of leave, and if pnrsoners were not released until the expiration of the entire period of imprisonment to which they had been sentenced. Another and a more serious evil for their considerationwas the difficultywhichareleasedprisoner found in obtaining honestemployment. (Hear.) Evidence from all quarters agreed that, in this respect, the case of a released prisoner was almost hopeless. The governor of a county gaol had told him that he frequently received appEcations from men, who had really reformed, prayingr him, for God's sake, to find them some employment. Within the last month some curious additional testimony upon this point had been given by convicts themselves at a meeng convened by Mr. Mayhew. At that meeting, held in London on the 12th of last month, and fully reported in 27ie Times, several released convicts stated their cases. One of them, answering to the name of " Peter," said:- "Arriving in London -without a farthing, and without a friend in the world, with no prospect of empyiyment, and with no one, if he wanted a meaF, to say, 'Here it is for you,' what was a man to do? Before he could bring himself to thieve he walked the streets in a vain search for work for three months, until he wore out two pair of shoes, and grew emaciated from having nothing better to eat than a hit of bread and a herring. In this desperate state of things he metwith his old associates, and fora period of two months he did very well as far as money went, for he made 51. or 6Z. a-week. This, however, was earned bv practices which he sincerely disliked; but then, if the pnblic would not allow him to make 1Z. by honester means, what was a man to do? This course, as might have been expected, soon led to his apprehension, and he was sentenced to another 12 months' imprisonment, which expired only last Monday." This difficulty would continually recur, for if he went to aiy of their lordships and raid1 " Htre is a evicted tief who is sincerely reformed, and wishes to bacome yourb ti Ir and take charge of your silver plate;" or, ",here s a r- formed drankard who wishes to taie charge of your cellar,7 no doubt he should betoldthat, although the testimonials of the two convictsewere very satisfactory, the situations would be given to men who had always been honest and always been' sober. He wished to dirert their lordships' attention to a most able minute drawn up by Lord J. Ru3l1, and laid be-. fore Parliament so long ago as 1S39, bat which weU deserved studying at the present moment for its application to what was seen passing around us. Lord J. Russell said:- " France is at present suffering from the ss of released convicts, who, after being confined at the galleys,join the criminal portion of the community, perfectadeptsinforgcry and housebreaking and connuected by acquaintance and sU'ni i,thy with the thieves nd sw indlers of the community. lnismust be the case in any opulent and populous comnmunity, where crime has every temptation and industry is abundantly employed." If it wrere Said that Iord J. usEll nevertheleas took apart in the measures that led to the cessation of transportatiorn to New South Wales it only proved how necessay it was to view all the sides of a question. What he wished to argue was that this difficulty of finding employment was not one that any improvement in the details of punishment could remove. (Hear, hear.) It was a difficulty inherent and belonging to the system of retaining the convicts at all in this country.- (Hear, bear.) The Government might sendthese convicts to Bermuda or Gibraltar, and after the.y ad served their term might allow them to return home, orthey might try the dismal resource of the public buLks. These and other exedients had been tried, but with the same result. The pnsoners, on their return and release, all found this difficulty of obtaining employment. It was, he bad stated, inherent in the system. It was said that it was possible for a convict to assume a fictitious name, to deny his birthplace, and recommence his career in life elsewhere Bu4 these precautions were but the melancholy beginning of a life of poverty. It was said that in some parts of the country the police-most unwrarrantbly as he thought if the statementwere true,- for wich he didnot vouch-made it their busiess to hunt out every convict who was obtaininghbonest employment, and to g!o to his employer. telling him that the man had been a felon. This geserafly ended. in his dismissaL The difficulty resulting from the wani of employment seemed to him likely to follow as long as the convicts were retained at home. He could appeal to the Lord Chief Justice whether his brethren upon the judicial bench had not frequently had occasion t4 express their sense of the value of transportation. He believed that in private conversation the Judges were also ready to bear the same testimony. (Hear. let their lordships contrast the state of things in this country with the immunity from reproach which a man enjoyedin a colony. Two centuries ago the freebootersheldthatno treaty with Spain was binding south of theline. Inthe Australian colonies the rule was, that no offenes werereinembered against a man that had been committed onthe other side of the equator. A convict sent out to a colonial settlement underwent his term of punishment. He was then released, and if he reverted to his evil courses he was punished, and was liable to various penalties. But if he wished to find employment he could do so, and if he desired to reform he could pursue an honourable calling. It was begging the whole argument to say that our criminals ought not to be sent to our colonies to pursue their vicious courses there, because the man who was a crinmal in England would most probably not be a criminal in the oolomes. (Hear, hear.) He could frequently not obtain employment here, while he could, if he chose, get full emplovment there. The result was, that the criminal in this: country became the honest man on the other side of the water. The first practical suggestion he desired to make was, that he vished the Go. vernmea.t to consider whether some further encouragement and support might not be afforded to those useful institutions, the reformatory schools for the young. (Hear, hear.) The beneficial effects of these schools had been experienced in various parts of the country. There was no more strildng and valuable account of the reformatory schools than was contained in the memoir upon Glocesterhire of Mr. T. B. Baker. Hementioned this result as to Cheltenham. In that town the Police in Janua, 1852, reported thatthere were about 20boys under the age of 14 who had been once convicted, and abut 20 more who. under the same age, had been twice, or thrice, or four times convictedL 1r. Baker added-" I believe that I can now say that there is not at present in Cheltenham more than one boy under 16 who has been twice convicted." (Hear.) Mr. Baker went on to indicate the true and only principle upon which these zeformatories should proceed-a principle without which, he did not hesitate to say, they would do harm instead of good. He said- e propose to give our boys no advantage which the vons of honest labourers coula not get if they pleased. [Were they to offer to come on the same terms they would [be chosen in preference to our boys." (Hear.) This was most important to remember; for if any enthusiastic men in their benevolent zeal offered advantages in their institutions to the criminal beyond that which the honest man could obtain, they wonld do harm rather than good. (Hear, hear.) But upon the principle 'that he had quoted, and looking to the leneficial resuls that had followed from these schools, he put it to Her ajesty's Government whether some further aid could not be given so as to increase the number of boys in these institutions. (Hear.) With respect to these reformatory schools for the young, the difficulty of want of employment vanish?d, because a fault committed by boys would not weigh against them in after life, -when the same fault committed by grown.up persons would argue that they were hardened offenders. His next suggeshon, and the principal one, was, that the Government would turn its thoughts to the possibility of finding a new colony for the reception of criminals. (Cheers.) He wished. then, in the first place, to consider what resources our present colonies afforded. HIe desired, in the clearest terms, to lay down the principle, that convicts ought not, onder any circumstances, to be sent to any of our colonies without the fullest and freeest consent of the colonists themselves. (Hear, hear.) He would go further, and say they ought not to be sent, except upon the invitation and by the request of the colonists. He also thought Her Mfajesty's Govermnent should remove the fears of the colonies, that convicts 'would be imposed upon them by force. The colony of Western Australia had expressed a clear and general wish for the reception of convicts. We had sent to them about 300 a-year, but the colony vwnted 600 or 700 a-year. The colonists wished to have more convicts; it was our interesteto send them, but by a self-imposed restriction we could not do so. Would it not be most desirable to relax that restriction at the earliest possible moment? (Hfear, hear.) He hoped Her Majesty's Government would give some information on the subject of the settlement of Moreton Bay, as he understood that settlement wished to receive convicts; but the large colony of New South Wales to which it belonged, objected, and in deference to that objection no further steps had been taken. He did not know whati might have occurred lately. He asked for information, and, without'expressing any opinion, he thought it a matter which well deserved the attention of the Government. Supposing that the resources of Western Australia and Moreton Bay were inadequate, the Government should consider whether a new colony might not with advantage be established. The last report on prisons contained a remarkable statement from the chaplain of the Wakefield House of Correction. " The chaplain states that he has received a very interesting account from a friend (who made inquiries on the spot) respectinglO9 convicts from Wakefield prison, -who were embarked on board the Hashemy, Mount-Stuart Elphinstone, and Adelaide, all of whom were landed (those by the first-named ship at Sydney, the others at Port Phillip) in ;the year 1S49. These prisoners had al been three vears in the colony, and the report of their conductwas as follows.- Very good, 77; good, 11; conditionally pardoned, 1; indiffe -bad, 6; very bad, 6;- reconvcted, 2total, 109." Summing together the "bad,' the "dvery bad" and the "reconv(cted," they amountedto only 14 out of 109, or not one-seventh of the whole; and he would ask whether oneseventh, or anythmi g like one-seventh-whether anythiga short of one-half or two-thirds of any whole number, could, inlike mam er, be predicated of the convicts retained at home?s (Hear, hear.) The only objection to founding a new penal settlement was, that it would not have the advantage of diffusing the convicts, when released, among a free population. He admitted the objection had some weight, but the same objection applied to the Australian colonies when Mr. Pitt established the first convict settlement in 1788-when Botany Bay was inhabited only by the savage Australian and the kangaroo; and it was hard to say which was the lower in feeling and intellet. In the course of half a century those colonies had made immense progress; the convicts had been well cared for, and the mother country relieved from their charge. A distinguished man at Sydney said that, in the splendour of its public establishments and the height of intellectual cultivation, it was almost equal to several of the smaller capitals of Europe; and according to General M'Arthur, who now held command at Melbourne, the exports of wool from Austr.alia exceeded 10,000,OOOlb. If any one doubted that the greatness of the Australian colonies was produced by convict labour, he would refer them to the words of Sir Richard Bourke, for many years governor of New South Wales, who said:- " From what I have seen effected in New South Wales, Iam induced to set a high valne upon the power of commanding convict labour during the first processes of settle- ment ina new country. The great demand for labour incident to such undertakings has seldom, if ever, been ade[quately supped by free People. Where these have been reled on, and no other description of labour obtained, the progress of the incipient colony has been slow and difficult; ence the strikng cont-rast between the condition of the Swan River settlemnent and that of New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land. In New South Wales. by the aild of convict labour, the industrious and skilful settlers have within a period of 50 years converted a wilderness into a fine and flourishing colony. It is sufficient to say that this great and rapid advancement is, under Providence, to be attributed to the command of labour obtained by transportation from Great Britain and Ireland." With reference to the honour ancd pride which Engishmen derived from their connexion with these Australian colonies a remarkable return was read by a noble lord at a public meeting a few days since, showing that the consumption of British exports was Is. id. per head in France, 5s. Sd. per head in the United States, 35s. per head in Canada, and 7& per head in Australia. (Hear, hear.) Such, then, were his views, and such the facts upon which they were founded. He hoped that Her Majest.'s Government would not think that he had approached this subject in any hostile spirit. He found no fault with them. He acknowledged the difficulties with 'which the question was surrounded. but amid these difficulties there was one consideration which must cheer and encourage us-the consideration that our pst efforts would be conducive to our iature success. Wvith thbis encCourageent-and knowing how many able and enlightened men were applying their minds to this qneseion, he hoped at no distant day to see the foundation of a better system-a system which should be just the Government to the colony, and to the criminal. (Chleers.) - Earl GRANtVILLE could assure the noble lord that nothing was further from the disposition of the Governmentthantoregard the remarks which he bad made as characterized by any spirit of hostility. No speech coult have displayed more ability or a more conciliatory spirit (bear, hear); nor could anything be more satisfactory tlaa

The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, in the absence of his right hon. friend the Home Secretary from indisposition, stated that the Government proposed to proceed with the other estimates that evening, and to take those relating to education on Monday. ORDER OF BUSINESS. Mr. DISRAELI said, it would, be greatly for the convenience of the House if the right hon. gentleman would also afford them some information as to the probable course of public business for the ensuing week. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-We propose, in the event of the estimates not being concluded this evening, to proceed with the remainder of them on Monday; and on Friday we shall take the Police Bill. I shall give notice this evening that we intend on Monday to move that the House at its rising adjourn till Thursday. FAIL OF KAIS. Mr. DISRAELI said, he had heard that Monday week was a day on which it would be agreeable to the Government that the motion of his hon. and learned friend (Mr. Whiteside), relating to this subject, should be proceeded with. If that were really so, it was desirable that a distWmit understanding should be come to on the matter. The CHANCELLOR of tho EXCHEQUER said, that the Government were willing to make an arrangement, fixing the debate on Ears for Monday week instead of Thursday next. POLICE BILL. Lord HOTHAM said, it would be a great convenience if some day were definitively fixed for bringing on this measure, which had already been postponed-first from Friday to Monday, and from Monday again to Friday. In reply to Sir J. PAEWGToi, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he did not think it probable that the bill for the appointment of a Vice-President of the Committee of Pnvy Council for EIducation would be brought on next week, but he could not pledge himself that it might not.

Sir J. WALMSLEY gave notice that on the 8th of May I i i i I I he wouldi ask for leave to introduce a bill for amending the espresentation. (A laugh.) In reply to lMr. WMAus, Mr. WILSON said, that a statemnent of the grossamount ,of the public revenue and expenditure for the years ending 'the 31st of March, 1855, and the31st of March, 156, Wsin couse of preparation, and would be laid upon the table in a shorttime. POSTAL COMUNICATION WTIH AUSTRALIA, Mr. E. DENISON asked the Secretsy of the Treasury what was the existing state of the arrangements made by the Government with regard to steam postal communication with the Australian colonies? Mr. WISON replied, that it would be seenbvthe minute which had been aid upon the table, that those colonies had exhibited the utmost readiness to defray a portion of the expense attending the establishment of an efficient postal communication with this country. He believed that they were greatly indebted to the relative of the hon. member who put the qusestion, Sir W. Denison, for the arrangements which had been made on this subject. Last year Sir W. Denison addressed -a circuLar letter to the various Australian colonies proposing the stablishment of a monthly steam ommunication with this country, and suggesting that the colonists should bear a portion of the expense of the podal service; and the replies of the various colonies had been forwarded by Sir W. Denison to Her Mfajesty's Govermment. Those replies were so faivourable to the proposals of Sir W. Denison, that the Government felt no doubt whatever that the colonists would be prepared, when an arrangement was made, to give due effect to his intentions. He (Mr. Wilson) believed that re lies to Sir W. Denison's circular hadbeen receivedfrom sllthe colonies with the exception of New Zealand, and upon the receipt of these communications IHer .Majesty's Government lost no time in framing a system which they thought would be at once just to this country and to the respective colonies ; such system being detailed in the Treasury minute which had been laid uponthe table. In accordance with that minute tenders for performingthe postal service had been received from a great number of persons,hbutthe Governmentdidnotthinktheywouldbejustified in acoeptingany of those tenders; andasseveral new schemes of an improved character had bceen suggested since advertisementsfortenders werefirstissued, it was theintentionof theGovernmenttocallfornewtenders. An impressionseemed to prevail out of doors that Her Majesty's Government did not intend to do anthing with respect to these arrangements until the colonies had agreed as to the route to be taken, but no such intention was ever entertained by Her Majestys Government. They had simnply been desirous of receiving replies from the different colonies, in order to ascertain whether they acquiesced in the proposals of Sir W. Denison, and he was happy to say that the Govern!ment bad so much confidence in the intentions of the colonists, from the replies which had already reached them, that, as soon as they received from anyone a tender which they felt justiied in accepting, they would have nohesitation in at once making arrangements for the establishment of a poal communication. Sir . PINGTON asked whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Governtent ito arange a directsteam comnunication with the Australian colonies irrespective of the Indian mail; whether that communication would be carried on by firclass vessels; and whether the Government were prepared to organize sucn communication without the delay which would be occasioned by any further reference to the colonies Mfr. IBLSON said, it was not the intention of the Government to stipulate for any particular line, because they thought the best way of brintgrng public opinion to bear upon the subject was to receive proposals of any kind (hear), and, therefore, the advertisements issued by the Adsmrslty would not specify any particular line or any description of vessels. As he had already stated, the instant any tender was made which the Government thought it would be for the interest of the countryto accept, they would he prepared to enter into a contract for establishrig steam postal communication with Aulstralia. CONSOLIDATION OE TE STaTUwTES. In reply to Mr. L. KatG, Sir F. KELLY said, the Statute Law Commission had resolved npon the consolidation of the entire statute law of England, and were now taking steps with the view of effecting that obiect. The bills for consoEdating the statute law would be reduced into classes, and each class would be sub. divided into single bills. Wth regard to the bills relating to offences against theSperson, it had been thought desirable that they should all be laid bpon the table at one and the same time, and should go an-i afssu throrugh their different stages. The wihole class of bills on the crimninal law would be prepared snd re-ady to he iaiii 'nthe table in six weeks from the present date, while Fhoe with respect to the mercantile la, would be combaletea inc seffiient time to enable them to be discussed and passed during the present session. REMOVAI EROl THED CE PA. In reply to Captain SconsB1L, Sir C. wrOOD said, the Government had come to no decision as towhether lne-of-battle ships, frigates, or smaller vessels of war should be employed in corveying troops, stores, or munitions of war from the Crimea. THE: SEBASTOPOL CLASP. Sir J. PaXIiGTON inquired whether the Com eissariat officers were to be allowed the Sebastopol clasp, and, if not, why not ? Mr. PEEL re lied that it had been decided with the concuarence of Lord Hardinge, and after communication with the Commander of the Forces in the Crimea, that, as a general rule, none hut combatant officers should receive clasps commemorative of actions. THE FIREWORKS INT HYDE PARK. Lord R tYHA2i asked by whose directions and under whose superintendence thelarge building recently erected in Eyde Park had been constructed, and under what estimate it was proposed to defray the expenses w Mr. MONSELL replied that the struoture referred to had been erected upon the authority of Lord Pamnure, with the concurrence of the Chief Commissioner of Works. ("wNo, no !") He believed that that very day (hear, hear) Lord Panmure and the Chief Commissioner went to the spot together in orderuto ascertain whether there was any mode of avoiding some inconvenience anticinated from the temporary obstruction of one of the roads through the park. (dear, bear) LWith regard to the other part of the question, it had been atranged with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that an estimate should he prepared and presented to the HIouse for defraying the cost of the building and other expenses of the like nature. If an estimate had been submitted beforehand the building conld not have been completed in time for the purpose for which it was intended. (A laugh.) Sir F. TEESIGER.-May we ask what that purpose is? (" Hear, hear,"r nd laughter.) Mr. DONSELL.-For fireworks. (" Oh, ohe s and a laugh.) Colonel KENOX asked thue Chief Commissioner of Works whether it was under his directions that the building had been erected, and whether he had sanctioned the expenses being paid ont of the revenues of the Board of Works Sir B. HTAl:l replied that he had nothing whatever to do with the cost of the structure. He visited the spot that day with Lord Panmure, being anxious to see that the thoroughfares in the Park were not interfered with, and he was confident that no inconvenience would arise in that respect. Colonel KNOsw srd, the rig dnt hon. gentleman had not answered his question-namely, whether he sanctioned the erection of the building! (Hear, hear.) Sir B. HALL.-That was no part of my duty; I have nothing to do with sanctioning the erection of the building. (Cheers and laughter.) Mr. G. D11NDAS.-lt has been said that the structure isintended for the display of firev -urk;s. May I ask what the fireworks are for, and whether, as reported, they will cost 10,OOOL.? The CHANCELLOR of the a E QtR.-At the proper time full information of the details of the expenditure will be given to the House in any form which the hon. gentleman may desire. (A laugh, and cries of. "What is it after a pause of some moments, Mr. G. DU.N)AS rose and said that his question had not been answered. (Cheers.) Would no right hon. gentleman on the Treasury bench favour him with a reply? (After another pause, during which the hon. member remamned standing, he added), Still no answer. Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer will not be disinclined to afford us some informnation on the subject. WZhat are the fireworkrs for!? (Cheers and laughter.) The CHIANCE:LLOR of the iEXiCEQtTER.-I was not aware that the hon. gentleman was serious in putting his question (" Oh, oh l" and alangh), or I would have answered it. Ef he seriously puts the question w ith any donbt as tewhat theanswer'will be, I may state tehim that the building has been erected in Hyde Park with a view to the celebration of peace. (Cheers and laughter.) The subject then dropped. THE INDIAN ACCOUNTS.. Mr. OTWAY said that at theend of last-sessionThe House resolved that, as far as practicable, the Indian ac- counts should be made np to the 30th of April of the year preceding that in which they were to be submitted to Parla.ment. He begged to ask the President of the Board of Control what steps he had taken to give effect to that resolution ? Mr. V. SHITH replied that he had been in communica- tion with the authorities in India on the subject, and he had no doubt that an acceleration would take place in the preparation of the Indian accounts. EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) BILLS. In reply to Mr. HADFnrxD, The LORD-ADVOCATE said that he intended to take the second reading of these bils on Monday next. TEE MESSRS. GRISSELL. Mr. MAIJNS postponed until Monday his notioo with respect to the charge made by the clerk of tleo Ordnance against the Messrs. Grissell, in order that hon. members might have an opportunity of reading the doumne-uts which hadbeenplaced in their hands that iorning. GRANTHELAX. Lord W. GRA HAM inquired -whether any negotiations were in progress with the Great Northern Ytaiway Company for restoring the direct comrmunication whico laely existed between Grantham and the Eastern Coiuitiqs ? M1r. WILSON replied that every mncans lind been adopted by the Post-office to induce the Grcat Nortbern Comaytny to ater their arrangem6ents but hitherto without scocess, and no negotiations were pending at the present moment. THE NAVAL REVIEW AT SPITHEALD. Colonel FREN\CH asked what were tho arrangements which had been made for the attendance of the House of Commons at the naval review. It was rumo red that the First Lord of the Admiralty hbad placed xt the disposal of. the House of Lords a vessel of -sufficient size toacoommodAte the wives of the noble persons invited. No such pro- viE on had b-en made for the wives of members of thli House of Commons ;- and-report stated that an applicatio2 which had been. made by. the Speaker, on behadfof thet HROUS6 for the use of . the 11imaaya-a large and commo. dions esel-had been refused Why should not member3 of the House of Commons have an. opportunity of taking their wives as the members of the other House had? ( laugh.) Mr. I)DSAY asked whether the Perseverance, t hich a been devoted to the servioe of the House Of Cominincai On the eventful day in question, was the same vessel of that name which had been capsized lagt year? (laughter.) if she were he trusted that tha Govenmint -would provide a suffcient number of lifeboats. Looking at the qaestiehi. n -a more serious view, he thought tba we had expended qftite enough in the sd reality of war, an d that the Govern. ment ought to abardon the idet of Spending more upon this show. S;r. LA-YARD aked whether it were tre that aih b ge saumber of gunboats were being fitted out wand uoirh e the purpose of the review alone? - - Admiral WAlCOT thought that it woull not be satist. tory for any hon member to -be precluded from taking his wife to see he review. It was not consonant with humra nature for a number of men to go and enjoy a sight of this description without their wives. Sir C. WOOD, after observing that it had been found ncssary to prepare a large feet fo the operations of war, saidthat now that peae had been proclasied it was not re 'uste to continue those operations. He thonht, however, ta it would. be not ungratifying to the tOuse e wanco the nation to see the means which the country had at its disposal in cas'the calamit7 of war had bee oon. thinued (Cheers.) Until the ratificatiot s of peace v ere actually exchanged, it would not be right to put any of these numerous vessels out of comimisson, and it wtas not; correctto say that any c ent expenses had been iuicurred for the mere purposes of the show. With regard to he e queshon of accommodation, he oIbserved that there mut necessarl1 be sorae limit to it; for he doubted, if it wer to be proiiaed for all who applied for it, whether the whole of the unemployed ships of Ier majestds navy woud ibe sufficient for the purpose. In making arrangements for the presnt year the authorities had of course to be guided to a co nsierbl extent by the precedenxt of the last review; andi it amut be reme tbered to what extent 68 mnembers of .penetli teen t, s neirumieros;e da siemigxtgo.

Two steam ers ol to the service of the two Houses would be lying t Tath. ampton, and would convey the memnbers to the vessels ap. propriated for their reception. A train would leave Southampton somewhere about 6 o'clock in the evening, which woul brng mmbes bak t Lonon.Memnbers. would have to pay their railway fares, but refreffiment would be provided on board the vessels; "and for that," said the right hon. baronet, "we make no charge." (Much laughter.) ROAD THOUGH Tq p4R7X. Sir B. TTA said that various plans had been proposd wit'h a view of affording convenience to the public in connexion with a road through the park. The first line of communication was that commencing in Pall-mall, passin through the German Chapel, proceeding along the navea road into the Mall, and then, branching westward, going in front of the palace and out by Bnckingham-gate. The next was a foot-bridge over the ornamental water in St. James's Park. The third was a road from Waterloo. place to the Mall terminating near Storey's-gate, and the fourthwas by an opening atathe east end of the 3nd to Charing-cross and Trafalgar-square. Dealing with the last proposition first, he found that nothing could be done in that direction wvithout anl act of Parliament, because the proty did not belong to the Crown, and could be dealt with only by means of a private bilL He did not propose, therefore, to take any vote in relation to that estimate this year. Wi2th regard to the road from Pall-mall to Buckngham-gate, it would commence, as he had already explainme in Pall-malL, pass through the German Chapel, proceed along the paved road into the Mall, and then go in front of the Palace, and out at Bnckingham-gate. That line had been considered - by the committee, and the estimate of the expense at which it could be made was 21.900L., a sum which included the expense of taking down and rebuilding the German chapel, but which did not include the cost of a new site for that chapeL That road was one which he proposed sbould be made, and it-was his intention to move an estimate in relation to it. The next line was one which was proposed for the accommodation-of pedestrians by means of a bridge across the ornamenta water, and he proposed to move an estimate for that line which would, le beieved, be a great accommodation to the public. When a bridge of that description did exist it had been found most useful, and he had seen documents which proved that there was a strong feeling against its removal, and also that requisitions had been made to the Treasury for its reconstruction, in consequence of which the Treasury had agreed to advance S,0DO. for that purpose, but that reconstruction had never taken place. The otherlineproposedwas onefromWaterloo-place,through Pall-mali, and thence to Storey's-gate. The adoption of that line had been carried in the committee by his casting vote as chairman, and he felt bound to say that he still adhered to the opinion that that road would form a mot useful opening(hear, hear), and woald very materially relieve the increasing traffic in the neighbourhood of Charing-cross. He regretted, however, being compelled to say that some difficulty had arisen which might saspend the commencement of that undertaling. In the year 1826 George IV. vacated Carlton-house for Backingham Palace, and he then desired that the ground upon which Carlton-house was situated should be let upon building leaseS and consequently plans were drawn out and submitted to parsons who were desirous of becoming lessees of the Crown, and in the leases a covenant was introduced that the lessees should have the uninterrupted enjoyment of the terrace from east to west. Subsequently to that time, and soon after the accession of WilUiam IV., a road was commenced which cat the terrace in half, and the lessees protested against what they considered to be an infringement of the rights conferred upon them under their leases. The opinions of Sir James Scarlett and Sir Edward Sugden, the then law officers of the Crown, were taken as to whether the lessees could, under the terms of their leases, successfully resist the constraction of the road which was then proposed, and those eminent persons agreed in thinldng that they could make a successful resistance. In consequence of that opinion negotiations were entered into between the Office of Works and the lessees, which ended in the lessees withdrawing their opposition upon the condition of having their groundrents reduced. HcLe had himself been of opinion that the results of that negotiation were conclusive, but. in consequence of a statement which had been made by a noble lord in another pe, he had felt it to be his duty to look more fally into the matter, and he found that some difficulties might exist as to carrying out the preposed line. Those difficulties, however, were not, he beheved, insuperable, but stil he feared that it would not be within his power to move an estimate for that road immediately. He thought, however, that when noble lords and hon. gentlemen who lived upon Carlton-terrace saw that the Queen herself had consented to carriages passing under her own-windows they would not throw obstacles in the way of the constraction of this important thoroughfare (Hear, hear.) He knew that there was a great objection entertaied to the removal of the Duke of York's column, and he found that the road could be made on either side of it as wide as many of those which led into the public prkis, and therefore he should not propose the removal of that column. (Hear, hear.) The roads, therefore, which he proposed to make were, first, a road commencing in Pall-mall, passing,through the German Chapel, and proceeding along the paved road into the AM, thence passing in front of the Palace, and running out by Bucking am-gate; and the other -was a road for the convenience of pedestrians, which wouldrmn over the ornamental water by means of a bridge. It was his intention to move the estimates for those works during the following week, and, if it should be the pleasure of the House to agree to them, he would press forward the works with the greatest possible despatch, and he believed that, when concluded, it would be found that they would provide accommodation suffident for all requirements. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY said that the right hon. baronet had not mentioned -what was the sum which would be required for the construction of the bridgo over the ornamental water. During the last year 88,5M0,0001. had been spent, andthe House ought now to be very careful to avoid al expense which did not afford a reonable probability of adequate advantage. Sir B. HALL said that he proposed to ask for a sum of 21,9001. for the road which he bad first prowosed, and for the construction of the bridge for pedestianshe should ask for a sum not exceeding 2,S00L Mr. RICH said it would be a great convenience to hon, members coming down tothe house if a scheme could be devised for relieving the traffiec along Pall-mall. When the right hon. baronet introduced the estimates he hoped this point would bo taken into consideration. Sir J. FEI RGUSSON said that by a very simple arrangeaiment great convenience might be aforded to tho public, and wlici at tho samo time would obviate the objection maile by the right hon. baronet as to the danger of collision that would arise from allowing the passage of cabs by the staldo yard, which wav., that all carriages shouldbe required to go fro m Paliiul into St. Jamnes's l'ark through the stable. yard, ed should come from St. James'sPark into Pall-mall ry Uetard be tw enarlborough-h ouse and St.Jamnes'sPalace By this means all danger would be avoided, and itwould obviate thte necessity of expending a arge sum of mnoney for th acoosutodation desired by the public. (HEear, hear.) CUSTOM-HOUSE.-PASSGERS' BACGGAGE, Mr. JAXES M'GREGOR said, the Custom-house had alowed all baggage of passengers arrivinginLondonfromthe contnentobeexamnedoboadtheailsteamboat-sinLstea,l of being required to be landed at the Custom-house, Ho wished to know whether there was any objection to afford the same facility to passengers arriving by other steamboats than those of the mails? Mr. WMLSON said, it was quite correct to say that the Treasury had assnted to a Cstom establishment at Londonbidge, for the prpose of examining the baggage of persons arriving from France by the night amail. Thearrivals of the mail steam¢ers wereat stated tiLes, and therefore it was more easy to make ama arraigeusent for those boats; but the arrivals of other sumers were at a io hours, deenaing on the tide, sometimes in thue aftrnooai and sometisiues in

LONDON, SATURDAY, APRIL 19, 1856. In the House of Lords yesterday, The Earl of Er.LmNBonouair stated, he had received information of the occurrence of a case of torture in the presidency of Bengal; the perpetrator of it, however, had been severely punished by the authorities. He wished the Duke of AROLGL would make some inquiry into the facts. The Duke of ARGYLL undertook to do go. The Earl of ALBE-IARLiE fixed the 5th of May for his motion for the reappointment of the Co1mittee on Indian Teriitories. The Colonial Bank Billi was read a third time and passed. The Marquis of SALISBURY moved for copies of documents relating to the discharge of certain convicts upon tickets of leave; he wished to know the grounds on which they had been granted in these cases ? If the nmen could not get employment, the plan must fail; even if they wished to reform they found it impossible. The Duke of AR.GYLL explained the particulars of the cases referred to, which he contended proved nothing ag-ainst the system; he hoped the Marquis of SALISBuiRy would withdraw his motion. Earl STAxHOPE called the attention of the House to the whole subject of secondary punishments. The system of granting tickets of leave could not be argued by itself. There were great evils connected with it, not accidental, but inherent and inevitable; they might vary the details of the system, but the grand difficulty would remainthe men discharged could never obtain employment in this colutry against the competition of men of good character. The Government would] do weU to consider the policy of establishing some penal cololy where criminals could begin a new career. There, the offences conmnitted in the Old World were not remembered against them, and if they wished for honest employment they could find it. He admitted that no convicts could be sent to any of our colonies without their fulest consent; but he believed both Western A&ustralia and Aloreton Bay were ready to receive convict labour, though an objection had been made to any being sent to the latter settlement by the province of New South Wales, of which it formed part. Considering the advantage the Australian colonies had so long produced to this country by relieving us of our criminal population, and, looking at the present wealthy, civilized, and flourishing condition of-these colonies themselves, there was certainly strong encouragement to found another settlement of the same description. The system carried into effect by MAr. Pm.r in 1788 could not be objected to as something new and untried. Earl Gm&Nvrrs suggested that Earl STr&?,ori should move the appointment of a committee of inquiry into the question. Lord LmaToN believed the evils eomplained of must be borne at home, and that they must trust for improvement to the gradual progress of education. The state of Western Australia could be no gLuide, and they could not deal with Moreton Bay unless it became a separate colony. Earl GREY wished for a deliberate inquiry into the wvhole system. Perhaps the penal portion of a man's sentence might be better carried out in this country; but afterwards the colonies were invaluable as a resource to those who were emerging from punishment: they would there be placed in the best position to reform. It was most unjust that the colonists of NTew South Wales should refuse to allow to the settlers of Moreton Bay that convict labour from which they had derived so much advantage themselves. He strongly condemned the principle of the act of 1853, by which a sentence to four years' penal labour was substituted for seven years' transportation. The Earl of DEBBY believed that no old colony would noweverovercome the prejudice against transportation, and that we should be driven to devise ourselves the best means of dealing with our convicts. In the probation for tickets of leave there was not a sufficient variety of tests of reformation. Some island might be found on the coast of England that would be a natural prison, and North Australia was still open to them. Lord CAmpBELL hoped the system of transportation would be revived; at present he did not know what punishment he was inflicting when sentencing a prisoner. After a few words from the Earl of HARROW'BY, The LORD CHuNCzOBo explained that, but for the act of 1853, the same number of criminals would have been released without the check on their conduct furnished by the ticket of leave. The Marquis of SAiisniwV withdrew his motion; and Earl STANHOPE gave notice he should, on a future day, move for a committee of inquiry into the question. The House then adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to questions put by MIr. E. DEzisow and Sir J. PAKINGTON, Mr. WiLsoN stated the progress of the arrangements made for effecting a system of postal communication with the Australian colonies, which had been framed by the Government as just to the colonies and to the country, and whicn did not stipulate for any particular line. None of the tenders; however, had appeared to be such as the Government ought to accept; they had, accordingly, been reopened, and the Government, he said, -were prepared to enter into a conhtact as soon as an acceptable tender slhould be made. On the motion that the Hoouse at its risiag do adjourni until Monday, Sir B. HALL gave ample and detailed explanatiolls respecting the plans in contemplation for opening conmuunications through St. James's Park. Sir%E. PERity called attention to the increasing deficit in the revenues of India. The deficit inu the year ending April, 1855, he said, exceeded 2,500,0001., and he had no hesitation in saying that of the present year would be not less than upwards of 2,000,0001. He showed that over a large series of years the revenues of India had greatly increased, but that latterly there had been a deficit of revenue, which had been increasing fromi year to year. The question was, to what this unsatisfactory state of the Indian finances was to be attributed? The President of the Board of Control had said that the deficiency was chiefly owing to the expenditure upon public works; but he (Sir ERsKi,;) asserted that the cause was to be found in the series of wrars in which the Indian Government had engaged-and which were not defensive wars-and th-e annexations of territory. He read a statement of the profit and loss resulting from the annexatioin of Scinde, Sattara, thk Punjab, Pegu, Martaban, and Nagpore, which showed a net deficiency, alloving for excess of revenue, of 288,0001. Butthis, he said, gave averyinadequateidea of thereal loss, becausetliere hadbeen a large addition to the military charges, which had increased to the amountof 2,945,0001. EHaving stated these results, and the causes to which he ascribed them, he called attention to the policy of annexation, and entered upon a review of the administration of Lord DALHOusIE, dwelling particularly upon the recent annexation of the kingdom of Oude. He insisted that the maladministration of that country wvas overcoloured; but if it were darker than represented, he contended that the charge of misgovernment should be laid at our owvn door, shice it was the necessary effect of the fatal connexion between that State and the Government of British India which had been commenced by WARREPrN IAsTLNrS. The doctrine of annexation was unsound upon fiiancial principles; but, on the higher grounds of right and justice, and the obligations of every Christian Power, that House, he said, was called upon to interfere, and, by its authority, check the system of territorial aggrandizement in India, which must tarnish the British name and weaken the foundations of British rule. Mr. MutRoucmfollowed, denouncinginverystrong terms the proceedings of the Indian Governmient, especially wvith reference to the family of the Hajah of COORG. Mr. V. SirTH decEned to enter into any detailed statemnent upon those subjects at that time; the rroper occasion for discussing them was when the East India Budget was before the House, Sir E. PERRY having mlade no maotion. He totally dissented from the doctrine that annexation of territory was to be considered with reference solely to I ccuniary profit. If a particular annexation got rid of a state of perpetual inquietude, it was imipossible to say what its value might not be. Annexation was not to be discussed in the abstract as a policy; every annexation of territory must be taken by itself, and it was unfair to judge of the result during the first four or five years. He questioned the accuracy of Sir E. PERRy's figures, observing lthat the ouitlay upoII public works, including works of irrigation, which he had taken at 1,200,000., was therefore, in a sinigle item, nearly half the deficit of revenue. He admitted that the next great item arose from the annexation of telritory, whiclh would, however, ultimately realise a surplus revenue. There was another item, that of increase of clharge, not only in the military expenditure, but in the allowances of civil servints, which it was very difficult to keep down in India. With regard to the annexation of Oude, he believed that, vhen the papers were before the House, the public, so far from being dissatisfied, would wonder that such a state of things should have been allowed to exist so long by a Power which was the paramount authority in India. Inconelusion, he stated that he should have to announce, in his statement of the Indian finances, that the deficit of the last year was less than 1,900,0001. Mfr. OrwAY took the same gloomy viewv of the finances of India as Sir E. PEiRRY, and, with regard to the policy of annexation, observed that Ir. SAnrH had not touched the moral part of the quiestion, and he asked what were to be the geographical limits of the doctrine that one State might take possession of the territory of another on the plea of misgovernment i His quarrel with the annexation of Oude, he said, was that it was a direct violation of a treaty. Sir J. HoG, after correcting some misapprehensions of Sir E. PER.RY and hr. OrwAy respecting the finances of India, and observing that a desultory debate upon the subject cotuld only mislead the House, gave an analysis of the revenues and the charges during the last six years, whvich would explami, he said, the reason why there was a surplus in some years and a deficit in others. In the first four of those years there was a surplus revenue, and a deficit in only the two last; but the important question was how far the causes wvhich had brought about this deficit were permianent, wid how far tem- porary ? He showed that the land revenue was F diminished by occasional dearthls, and the opium. revenue by the disturbnces in China. On the side of expenditure anienormousoutlay hadcbeencaused by the erection of barracls for Eluropean troops,, I andwithin tho last two yearsaconsiderable sumn !had bon expended on acount of edouattion. Upo,n the whole, the deficit of revenue had arisen roin causes mostly temporary, while the increased' charges would be reduced when the country was restored to tranquillity. On the subjects of annexation and adoption he challenged a dis- cussion of any particular instance, denying thatX the abstract opinions of illustrious men, cited by Siri E. PERRy-some of which, he said, were mere truisms-had any application to the cases in ques. tion, many being cases of failure of heirs and lapses to the paramount Power. With regard to Oude the only difficulty would be, he said, to defend the Government, which had the right and power to dictate, for not sooner interfering. Mr. J. PB]ILMoRre condemned the polcy of annexation as being founded upon the most flagrant disregard of justice. The subject then dropped. Lord CnnrsEA inquired, whether any steps had been taken with a view to the erection of a public monument to the memory of the late Duke of WnrIlNGTON in St. Paul's Cathedral ? Sir B. HAT, said, the object had been delayed because no money had been voted for it by Parliament; but he had been instracted by the CH&wcriLOR of the ExcuQs3R to say, that he woould move the House that the snu remaining, after defraying the expenses of the funeral of the Duke of 1ViLRm'GTOwf, amountin to nearly 25,0001., should be expended in the erection of a monument to the late Duke; and, if the matter were placed under his control, he would call in aid several artists in this country, that we might have something worthy of the memory of that great man. The House then went into Committee of Supply upon the remaining Civil Service Estimates, the greater part of the discunsion turning upon the vote of 39,0541. for the nonconforming clergy, which was not carried without several divisions. The CHAiArN. having reported progress, the other orders of thedaywera gonethrough, andsome other business having been disposed of the House adjourned at a quarter past 1 o'clock until Monday.
There seems to prevail between England and the IUnited States some great misconception of each other's feelings. It cannot be doubted that when America is spoken of with bitterness in England it is always on the ground of an alleged animosity which its citizens display towards us. "' See the " conduct of these Americans !"-such is the usual language;-" without provocation on our part, and "from a mere impulse of ill-will, they are raising "a quarrel with us at the moment when all our "forces are supposed to be employed on other "objects." On the other hand, if we turn to American newspapers and magazines, or the report of American speeches, we hear but one complaint,-that England is ever scheming against the prosperity and progress of the New World ; that in English society no man has a good word for an American; that all feelings of common origin, history, and language are forgotten on this side of the Atlantic, under the influence of a groundless jealousy. Yet few have ever met an Englishman who did not declare with all sincerity that he wished for nothing more than the happiness and improvement of the States, while every one of our countrymen who crosses the ocean confesses that kindness, a hearty welcome, and a full appreciation of his country's merits have met him on all sides from the people whom he had always suspected and w ho are always suspecting us: The speech of Mr. DALLAS, the new American M1inister, reiterates sentiments which have been expressed by every representative which America has of late years sent to this country. It has often been the case that before the arrival of a new iMIinister fiom Washington we have received warning" of his temper and sentiments. Such a man is said to have been always unfriendly to England, to have been notorious for his war speeches, to have made strong threats concerning Canada and Cuba, and to have denounced BriMsh policy as essentially hostile to his own couintry. Yet it must be confessed that the language of all, on airiving in these kingdoms, has been pretty much the same. In words which go far beyond the usual commonplaces of diplomacy each successive Mlinister, whether Whig or Democrat, has declared his conviction that peace and goodwill between the two nations are necessary to the happiness of the world. It has been stated broadly that no real grounds of enmity exist, and that any politician Who can tamper with a friendship springing out of so many and such close relations of race, religion, and language is unworthy to govern, or evon to be tolerated by his countrymen. Mr. DALLAs has come to this country at a time when subjects of much supposed importance are debated between the two nations. The Government which sends him conceives itself to have cause of complaint against our own administrators. The honoiur of America is said to have been touched by a military enlistment on its soil, which, if not illegal, is, at any rate, iuncourteous and unjustifiable. A still greater wrong is declared to have been suffered by the States through our unjust interpretation of a doubtful treaty. Carelessness of American good fame, a plot against American development, almost an invasion of American territory, are laid to our charge. Yet no sooner is the supposed representative of these opinions among us than he repudiates all angry passions, and utters words which might befit the intercourse of two nations whose amity no dispute had ever ruffled. Mr. DALLAS speaks of the welcome he has received and the kindness with which his own country has been always named. If any American ever lands on these shores with a different anticipation he is likely to be disappointed, and to express, even after a week's residence, the acknowledgments uttered on Thursday at the MlIansion-house. The Minister further says that " he is not authorized to feel, nor does he " feel, any desire than that of giving his exertions " and energies unreservedly to the restoration of "the most harmonious sentiments and friendly "relations." He congratulates this country on the termination of the Russian war, but declares his opinion that its energies, however gallantly enlisted and ably directed, will find more fruitful employment in the cultivation of those arts of peace which have already so signally illustrated the history of our people. The practical question now remains to be answered. If the two coumtries have no just grounds of quarrel,-if the prosperity of each is bound up wvith that of the other;-if, as Mr. DALLAs says, no one in the United States wishes for war, why is there a continuance of these threats and recriminations ? It cannot seriouLsly be supposed that England has any desire to stain a continent and every ocean with blood in order to retain possession of a protectorate over a Red Indian chief who rules a tract of swamp and forest in a pestilential climate which is the terror of every European. Nor can any sensible man conceive that the precise point in the enlistment question which still remains unsettled is a matter of interest to people in this country, or that they even understand what it is. Every one lkno-ws that the English people only wish to be honourably rid of these paltry disputes. It is, indeed, quite possible that even the Mosquito question and the recruiting-office question might breed a -war of wlhich the generation which began it mighlt not see the cnd; for the history of the world is full of suchl follies, and -when there is a wish to fall out the subject-matter is rather the occasion than the canse. But every one tells usand we doubt not wvithi sincerity-that on neither side of the Atlantic is there any such embittered feeling. " If there be war," says 3Mr. DALLAS, "1 it must be in spite of uniform, steady, perse" vering, franl:, and honourable conciliation" on the part of America. If so, then it is de4r enough there will be no war at all. The;e questions might be settled in a fewv- hoils by two men of sense, detennined to come, to an amicable conclusion. We want nothing, and the Americans, if the truth be told, have need of as littlIe. If even there were solid advantages in dispute, it is certain that war would not obtain them for either people. Few persons have, we think, considered what a contest between the Anglo-Saxons of the Old and the Iew World would be like. Probably no war of which the memory has reached us would- be so wilde in its operations, so lasting in its duration, and so aisastrous in its results. The sails of the two nations whiten every sea; their traders are to be found wherever there is a harbour or a navigable river on the globe. The whole of this vast commerce would be, if not destroyed, at least imperilled, disordered, and diminished. It would be essentially a war of piracy and of pillage. We should probably lay in ruins all the flourishing cities of the Atlantic coast, while the homesteads of the Canadian frontier would be blazing far and wide from the inroads of American free corps. Protectionists may have their own notions of the cornnaercial results, but we fancy the first consequence of a rupture would be the ruin of half the properties in the Southern States and the stoppage of almost every mill in Lancashire. Ent we need not speculate on the details of a conflict which every man must feel would throw back the human race for a century to come. Nor would the conflict be short. The two nations are distinguished beyond any on the globe for stubborn pride and- invincible obsatnacy. The first atrocity committed on either side would be the signal for a relentless and exterminating war. The original question would be speedily forgotten, and the struggfe would continue because the pride and animosities of the two nations demanded it. It is such evils as these that MIr. DAX.As deprecates in his speech, and we trast that the sentiments he cnunciates will influence the negotiations with which he is intrusted, and lead to a speedy settlement of matters which are only important because they are little understood.
It is very often observed that one hears more. of the bad than the good in this world; for the, obvious reason that the good are pursuing-the' even tenour of their way, while the bad put -the2 machine oitt of gear, and. compel our-attention. Perhaps, if we took a little more care of the good, and gave them their proper work, as well as their due reward, we should save ourselves a little of that irksome and never-ending duty, the correction and, if possible, the reform of offenders. However it m-ay be, the subject recurs again and again; and last night the Lords returned to it wvith a gusto unintelligible to al but Dulkes, Marquises, and Earls. Really the question would now seem to be confining itself to a somewhat narrower compass than heretofore. The British public, indeed, has taken the alarm, [and every offender who turns out to be a ticket-of- leave man is multiplied into legion. This is not the only case in which the imagination can play tricks with numbers, for if but a single individual of a disagreeable tribe appears in a house he is supposed to be the precursor of scores, and if another appears myriads are looked for. The MIarquis of SALIsBunY has only produced twvo cases of ticketof-leave men properly applying to the new system, and he evidently believes the land to swarm with these vermin in an unreformed state. But what is the fact, and what is the true amount of the eA il -e are really called onto deal with ? Between 5,000 and 6,000 men have been released on tickets-ofleave under the new system wvithin two years and five months, and of these not more than 8 per cent. have been re-conmnitted. This makes about 200 a-year, scattered, it must be remembere3, over the whole kingdom. If anybody thinks tlis a very formidable amount of unreclaimed crime to let loose on a country, we beg him to consider a few other figures. At this moment 150,000 of oiur fellow-subjects are, or have been, the inmates of a gaol. It appears, then, that only one seven-hundred-and fiftieth part of them have been re-committed during the last twelvemonth, after receiving a ticket-of-leave. If a ticket-of-leave man never turns up, but lives or dies in happy obscurity, nobody will quarTel with his liberation; at least, we have no reason to do. So the question only relates' to those who are introduced again to the public notice, and who, like the garbage and other horrors we launch on the Thames witlh the ebb, nevertheless revisit our metropolis wsith the flow, making day hideous. The proportion is not very large, at least compared with otherfigures, and it is all we need now trouble ourselves about. The M31arquis of SALISBurY does not offer any suggestion as to the treatment of this incorrigible percentage of the people. He simply asks questions about the existing practice, which he conceives to work ill, though he has not made out much of a case. He has fallen into the common error of overlooking the fact that a large number of convicts condemned to transportation always have been set at large, either at the expiration of their term, or on account of illness, or for good behaviour. Possibly his sense of this confusion has led him to the more modest course of inquiry. The Duke of _amGY contents himself with answering these questions, and is, apparently, for giving the existing new practice some firther trial. Lord STrN}ForIMuakes up for the timidity of the two previous speakers or their poverty of invention, for he boldly suggests not only the encouragement of reformatory prisons, in which, perhaps, we should all of us agree, not only that we should avail ourselves more extensively of W7estern Australia for transVortation, but that we should establish a new penal colony-MIoreton-bay, for example, if New South Wales -will let us have it for the puapose, or some other place, wherever we can get one. The answer to this proposal, is that Wirestern Australia is pretty well saturated with convicts and ticket-of-leave men, and we must hold our hand as far as it is concerned. New South Wales will most certainly not consent to our taldng Moreton-bay and the other possible purgatory of rogues has not yet appeared, so that we have, therefore, nothing to say about it. Lord LyTrToN- also contributed a striling, if not quite available suggestion. 'With a strong protest against a new penal colony, he proposed that convicts, after a certain period of imnprisonment with hard labour enough to earn a little money, should be turned out of prison with their money in their pock-ets, and be told to cuit and nri. In other words, he proposes that they should be declared " exiles" in solemn form, desired to quit the country, and, if again found in it, should be liable to very severe punislument. It is natural to ask oneself where the poor wretches would go, if indeed they went anywhere; and Lord LYT=o-N is not very far wronfg when he hazards a conjecture that they would go to the United States. WVeze they to go there, wvere a lawto be passed of which the undoubted and foreseen operation was to fill the cities of -the United States with our convicts, and still more if kind people subscribed privately to send convicts there, wve leave Lord CLARENDON to imagine the rcsult on our present and future prospects of a good understanding aith the jealous republicans. The truth is, we must not be too impatient. Two years and five months are not quite trial enough for an importantlaw on a subject enveloped
jiien the newvs of the Crimean horrors arrived. in this country, not wvholly unexpected, nior yet without w-arning in what had occurred at iamna and in the long-deferred embarcation, it was often asked, both here and abroad, how it was that the English character, so vigorous, so practical, so inventive, so full of resources, was so Ettle rc-flected in what had just transpired of our :military operations. It was clear that England vas one thing at home, and another thing abroad. But this was not the whole of the puzzle. The soldier was hardy, brave, ready, and, <above all, thoroughly subordinate. EHe might be said not to have a will and scarcely a mind of lis own. W1'hence, then, the fai2lure of an army w-hich seemed to combine in an extraordinary degree the absolute obedience of the soldier -with the powver and skill of civilization ? Let us see how far an answer to this question is suppEed by the tone of the witnesses before the Crimean Board of Inquiry. Sir RICHARD AmEY must be considered a fair specimen of the more favoured class of British officers. He 'has enjoyed the friendship of our most powerful military men, and is evidently regarded wvith no disfavour by the Court of Inquiry. Intrusted With a most important position in the Crimea'with what sad re3ults we know-he has been rewarded with a still more important position, with w;vhat results we have still to experience. He is the British officer, the man of the Crimea, the very being on wvhom England anid all Europe were speculating a twelvemonth ago how it was that, being an Englishman, he was so little of an Englishmtan, and showeed so little of that race wvhich covers earth and sea with its achievements. The tone and temper of the man have now been tested, not merely by command, but by beinig brought into contact with two Royal Comnmissions, both of them coming from the samne source, and entitled to the same respect, as his oWn commission of Major-General and the comlunission of his Coimaunder-in-Chief. Under the first Commission tvwo officers of great ability and services went to -the Crimea to inqutire into the loss of many thou.- sez d -men and horses by want of food, clothing, aid shelter, in spite of immense supplies sent out from. this country. As General AiREvs office w-as directly responsible, and as the Generals of IDivision, Lord Luc_%mN, for example, referred to the orders from his office, of course the Commissioners of Inquiiry had to go straight to him and the register of his office. It is impossible to read Sir RicHARD Airaz's own account of what took place betiveen himself and the Conmmissioners without perceiving that he determined to -et theni at nought. Though they often sought him, and thriice actually sat down at the table of his office, and opened a regular examination, lie never answered one question by wrord of motuth. Though written questions were sent to him, he left them unanswered for maany weeks, muid, to all appearance, never would have answered them, had he not received a peremptoly order from I.ord P-5s3UP.£ to answer them by the next mail, vhich, by-the-by, he boasts he did not do ! Tie assumlled from the first that the inquiry was to be " only" into the Commissariat, and business of that sort, and that the only object was the future mendinig of that department. Even on this suipposition, though his ow.-n recent experience had showrn the importance of tlhat department, he nevertheless did not take one step, not one minute's trouble, not one word, not one stroke of the pen to adlvance that supposed object-the improvement of the Comnuissariat and Transport ser ices-till after the departure of the Comnissioners, and when he had received peremptory orders from HEP. ArlJESTr'S Secretary of War. He admits that, as it was his own opinion that a formal examination, in which the Commissioners were to take the lead, would be of no use, he was resolved nlOt to submit to it. He wvas ready, he says, to take a ride wvith one of them; and thinks, he says, that in free conversation he could have explained everything. No doubt many a man who, in the course of life or the vicissitudes of human affairs, has to stand an examination 'vould like to have it conducted in that free-andeasy manner. But the tvo Commissioners did not think they- were sent three thousand miles to in-quire into the loEs of an army in this pleasant conversational style. They resolved to ask questions and obtain answers, which they did eventually. So, as the answers have been obtained, and a report has been founded thereupon, let us now see how Sir RICsIARD AnY deals with a restlt so much beyond his anticipations. The second of the two Royal Commissions with -which Sir RiCisAzD AiREY has been brought in contact on the affairs of the Crimea is that now sitting at Chelsea. It sits, as our readers are aware, in no small state, as becomes an inquest on a dleceased army. Sir RGIi}LiRD, however, is above such influences, and he e.xhibits throughout his examination the same nonctalancc, the same easy way of shifting the responsibility from his ovns shoulders, and the same art of involving the subject in a perpetual haze, that he did in the Crimea. The chief point on which these qualities have been called for is a certain order found in the register of his office, and issuecl to the Generals of Divisionat the beginning of November, for the immediato stabling of the cavalry horses. The order was not carried out to any considerable extent till three - months afterwards, in February, and the question is how the order was issued ancl not obeyed. There is hardly a question as to the fact-and it is one of the most remarkable features of this campaign,-that nobody seemns to have taken the lrouble to see orlers carried out. Nolbody seems -to have gone about everywhere, early and late, as -we react of NApoIxoN and the Duke of WLslar.- ao;, seeing wvith his own eyes the state of the army, and the progress of the works ordcled to be done. Vith regard to the order in question, Lord: Luca? W= to haye a va>ne recoileotion of hardship, eQ- fusion, and difficulty, and really nothing more can be extracted from him on the momentous history of those three months,-of the disasters in which he may say, " Quorum'pars smagnafui." Be cannot say wvhether it was the uulcertainty of the position, or the want of tools, or the want of labour, or the abstraction of the men to other work, or the want ef wood, or of canvass. We are not surprised at this in Lord LucAN, who did not give the order, and had, no doubt, much practical difficulty in carrying it out. Sir RicHAiu ArsE, however, gave the order, and was responsible for its execution; but he is quite as dark on that subject as Lord L1ucAN himself; and we must say w,ilfully dark. In a Court created to inquire into the causes of a terrible military disaster for which he was oflicially responsible, he says at different times that the order was a matter of course, that it could not be executed, that the work of his office was done more by verbal communications than by written orders, that this particular order comprised more than could be done, but not enough for every purpose; that he supposes it was executed, as of course all orders from head-quarters are; that it is perfectly worthless as documentary evidence, and Colonel TULLOCH might have spared himself the trouble of quoting it; that, though he issued the order, he not only could not give the necessary means for its execution, but, when the huts did arrive, he sent them to the front, where they were more wanted. Sir Rrcum'P.D, then, by his own admission, issued orders by rote or at random, without knowing or caring whether they were executed, and did not watch for their execution. Of course, he might just as well have remained in London the whole time, dreaming that he was in the Crimea and performing that or any other office. But what we -wish to observe on is the effrontery of avowing all this in the Court, and employing his own scandalous adniissions for the sole purpose of baffling, not to say insuIlting, HEIL MAJESTY's Commissioners sent to the Crimea to make these inquiies. Having, as he thought, succeeded in refusing to answer that Commission on the spot, and being obliged afterwvards to answer written questions, he is now (isguisted to find that the Commission.did obtain evidence from himl on the spot-that is, from the register of his office; and, still more, that it is not very compatible with his own written answers. So he attempts to ride off under a cloud of confusion. The most spoilt child inl the worst conducted family in this kingdom could not behave with more levity to a tutor the least qualified to command his respect. Buit it was only with a view to the future, Sir RICHAnRD says, that the inquiry was to be made. He had no idea of its retrospective character. He must indeed have a marvellous power of directing his mental vision at will, if he is able to shut out even in his owvn mind the retrospective side of the inquiry. Then, is it so light a thing that about 3,000 horses, which cost on the spot, counting all things, not less than 2001. a-piece, perished miserably, without doing anything but that foors promenade at Balaklava g With what confidence can we send out our next brigade of cavalry to as distant and as hazardous a war, when the man who talks in this way of his own disaster is to direct the expedition from home? When a gentleman findls that, though his groom is a very fine fellow in his way, the stable becomes empty iunder his care, and the groom makes light of it, he will probably change his man before he renews his stud. He would rather see disaster taken a little more seriously, and then he would have the less fear of its early repetition. Biut it is not at all clear that Sir RicErRD would think it his place to mend matters, even if he knew how. He throws the non-execution of£ his order for the stabling of the horses partly on thQ badness of the tools, and adds that the tools of the British army are notoriously bad. But why ? It was his place to see that they were good. He was at the Horse Guards all the time the expedition was preparing ; he knew the tools were bad, and he did nothing. So far from accusing his own remissness, he now founds upon it a justification for not having attended to the execution of his own orders. It is England's own fault if she commits her armies, her men, her treasure, and her honour to men whom even experience will not make wiser; and -who, while alone responsible for her calamities, seem alone unconcerned.
RECAxRE OF THE BERKSHIRE JACK SHEPPARD. -The "last escape" of this convict from Portsmouth has already been reported. It appears that there he slipped his cable on Tuesday week, in broad daylight. Having learnt the buisiness of a tailor, he made himself a suit of clothes out of his rough sheets, and, having secreted them under his prison dress, took a favourable opportunity, while working in the dockyard, to retire into a corner, where ho doffed his convict outer garments, and dressed himself in tho work of his own hands. Being thus equipped, and leoking rather seedy, he boldly marched, as well as a pair of pretended knock-knees would allowhis, towards the main entrance of the dockyard, meeting in his way several officers. Then arrived at the gate, he was challenged ly the sentinel on duty as to what business he had tlhere; to which he made a ready answer, and then " cadged " of the sentinel, who then told him to clear off. This unnecessar- piece of advice he did not wait to be repeated, but hied off into a wood in the neighbourhood. Here he was followed in less than half-an-hour by a party from the dockyard, who by that time had missed him. They did not find him, however, and when the curtain of night had fallen he left his lair in the wood and committed a burglary in the neighbourhood of. Portsmouth, carrying off a quantity of eatables and 61. He seems su sequently to have taken the rail to Oxfordshire - and the next thing we hear of him is that on the night of Saturday or morning of Sunday last he was at Great Barford. 'There he ru3nmaged over the workshops of Mr. Lovel! and another carpenter, where he lighted fires of shavings, and carried away a saw from the former. His next exploit was at the house of Mr. Woolgrove, grocer, where he cut out with the saw the whole frame of a window ecured 'vith iron bars, and carried off a f ull suit of clothes, a hat, 21b. of tobacco, and about lOs. in copper, the inmates of the house remaining sound asleep all the time. He next visited his old friend's stable-Mr. John Tiansis, Little li.arford-but there he did not find what he was in search of, and accordingly went over to Mr. Austin's, where he rode away with a fine white horse, a halter, and a sack, through HIornton, into Ilatley parish; where, it being now daylignt of Sunday morning, he dismounted and turned the horse up a lane near Lord Villiers's mansion. By this time Superintendents Dixon and Burton, of Deddinaton and Banbury, were on his track, and they traced him to Wellesbourno. During the day the valuable services of Mr. Hickling, superintendent of the Warwick Police, and of Sargeant Bumnford, of the same corps, were enlisted in the search for the fugitive; but nothing further was heard of him until Moniday night about 9 o'clock. At that time a nrumber of people were keeping Saint Monday at the New Inu, Hatton, when they were astonished ona hearing three or four panes of glass smashed in the window of the room in whicl some of them were assembled. They of course ran to the outside to see the depredator, and in the dim moonlight saw Hirons running at foll speed towards the canal. Tney could not capture him-he was too swift for them. On inspection, they found that he had gained admittance to a bedrooml by forcing the window, and after ransacking every corner he had taken away a silver watch and silk handkerchiefs, but could find nomoney. His heel had accidentally slipped as he was escaping from th6 window, and thus he had unwillingly sounded an alarm. About a quaxter of a mile from the \ew Ihis he immediately went and comnitted another burglary at the house of Mr. William Smith, farmer. Thence he stole a shoulder of mutton and other viands, a pair of watertights; and he also seems to have enjoyed hinself in eating the best that the house afforded, and in drinking several cups of ale. After such a good night's work it was reasonable to suppose that he would require some rest, and therefore it was inferred that during the next day he could not be far distant from the scene his toils. lUnider this impression a numerous party of impromaptu detectives was got togetber,and began a vigorous and diligent search for the not unworthy representative of the nunulerous body of "cracksnnen." About two o'clock the same day (Tuesday) le was surprised in a barn in the Old r'ark, WFarwick; but even here his good fortune did not quite leave hiu, for he got out and outran all his pursuers, until a horse was obtained, and then after a hot chase of three miles lie was run down and secured, and conveyed to Warwick lock-up. There it was found that he was dressed in the clothing stolen from Mr. Woolgrove, of Great Barford; and that hehadin his possession nearly all the property he had lately stolen. The halter which he had stolen along with the horse was found under a stone in the parish of Eatley, near to where the horse was found. The prisoner was to be brought before the magistrate at Warwick yesterday chargedwith the burlaries committed at Hatton. The prisoner atteiiptefi to break out of WYarwick Gaol a fewv years a"o by mneans of the mrlain sewer; but from some cause lihe was iled.

THE BRITISH ARAIY. (FRwx OUR SPECILL COORSPONODN.) | KEIGHTS OF SEBASTOPOL, SATUp.DAY, ArRIL5. - The proclamation of peace was made to the allied armies by salutes of 101 guns, fired by the field batteries of the Light and Second Division, from the heights over the plain of Balaklava, by the French batteries at the Quartier Generale, by the Sardinian redoubts at Feduikhine, and by the menof-war at Kamiesch and Kazatch, at 2 o'clock p.m. on Wednesday, the 2d of April; but an early general order and a very widely-spread rumour had diffused the intelligence widely among officers and men long before the cannon exultingly announced it with their thundering voices. At Balaklava the news was known by 8 o'clock, and the Leander, Captain Rice, bearing the Sag of Admiral Fremantle, was " dressed" with the flags of the allies about that hour, and the merchant shipping by order followed her example, so that the harbour presented a gayer scene probably than human eye ever witnessed there since it was first discovered by some most investigating, shore-hugging, and fissure-pursuing navigator. It -was a fine day,-at least it appeared so, by contrast with its recent predecessors,-and the effect of the firing from so many points, all of which were visible from the heights of the plateau near the Woronzoffroad, was very fine. 'The enemy saw the smoke and heard the roar of our guns, but they maintained- a stern and gloomy silence. One would have thought that they, above all, would have shown some signs of satisfaction at the peace which they sought, and which they had made such sacrifices to obtain, while no one would have much wondered if the batteries of the English and Sardinians expressed no opinion on the subject. However, there was not a Russian shot fired or flag hoisted from Fort Constantine to Mackenzie, nor has any increase in our intimacy taken place, although we have ceased to be enemies. The Tchernaya is the boundary of our wanderings, and the Commander-in-Chief in general orders reminds the army that the limits originally assigned to them will be strictly maintained. All the thoughts, all the conversation of the camp, are turned on their probable destination and on the order of embarcation, and, as it is generally rumoured-I know not on what grounds-that Shumla, Varna, Gallipoli, Smyrna, Candia, and places in the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles will be occupied by-portions of the allied armies, conjectures on these matters become of great interest and importance. There are departments of the army which are threatened with immediate reduction, and the extent and mode of effecting that reduction are subjects of animated controversy, not umningled with apprehension. The fate of our various Legions and the prospects of the Turkish Contingent are also passed in review. Russia has for once paralyzed the action of our battalions. She certainly wvould have failed to do so in the open field. Not only is the British army proper in splendid condition, but the Contingent is said to be in the finest order, and, as far as a civilian can judge of troops by their external appearance, Her Majesty'has no better soldiers in her pay than the Swviss Legion at Smynia, under Colonel Shieffield Dickson. Active steps are being taken to prepare for the embam.cation of the army and the stQres of material wvhich have accumulated here to such an extent. The Jura, the Candia, and the Argo have returned with the Artillery which they brought out as far as Balaklava, and have ere this arrived at Constantinople, on their way to their respective destinations. The Tmperador, the Severn, the Colombo, the Ottawa, the Cleopatra, and the Zebra - steam transports are in harbour, waiting for orders, and the Med- way'sailed yesterday. A number of pontoons hay~e.' been constructed by the engineers in Balaklava to facilitate the embarcation of the troops, and it is calculated that 7,000 per day can be put on board sllip in that port. There are not so many facilities atKazatch, but on a calm day a great number of men could be embarked there also. General Codrington has taken an active part in the preparation of the pontoons, and pays almost daily visits to Balaklava, for the purpose of arranging the detais of the departure of the expedition. The French expect their fleet will be sent for them,>aud, althoughl theirstores bear no comparison pro ratd to those of our army they will take a long thue to embark. It is said that the railway will be utilized at Heraclea, and that the rails will be carried there for the purpose of openingacommunication between the coal mines and the seaside. The weather has been uncommonly severe during the week, but to-day gives promise of coming spring, although the ground of the camp is white with patches of snow, and the distant mountain ranges retain their cold, wh1ite, wintry aspect. On Tuesday evening a " bal" was given in a huge shed outside Kadikoi, open to all the world, under French auspices. It was notified in orders that English officers and ladies were invited to attend, but there was a suspicious dash under the last word the full effect of which some of the few Englishwomen living in Balaklava and the camp with their husbands did not understand. On their arrival they were soon made aware that the ba.l was a sort of masculine military carnival, and the lively demeanour and eccentric attire of some of the masks warned their - lieges to draw them away as soon as they could make a decent retreat. One or two English Generals went in their orders, under the impression that the bal was a grand military entertainment of ceremony; and there was a large number of officers present. They were admitted free, but had to pay for " refreshnients," and these were of such a very invigorating description that many of theni were enabled to share in the festivities of our allies till it was almost time for the morning parade. About 2,000 English, French, and Sardinians attended, nearly all mi full uniform, with orders, medals, and ribanlds; and as a spectacle the scene was very brilliant. Thursday brought us a violent snoi;storm ! The wind was violent and bitterly cold, and as it tore over the plateau it dropped masses of sleet or precipitated clouds of snow flakes over the camp, and in a few minutes hurled winter upon us once more. It was, indeed, an awful day! Scarce man or beast could face the blast and the driving storm. I could not at times distinguish the guard-tent within a few yards of my hut, or see the next shedc to mine; water was frozen in my room into a thick block of ice. The French army, at Feduikline, which had just come out to zun itself for the last day or so, when the rays at mid-day tempered the northerly breeze, were driven back into the sickly tents and huts, where fever is more common than one would like to say. General Eyre, active as I usual, and ever inspired by the spirit of milita ry martyrdom, actually marched out his division for a little gentle exercise in the midst of the snow. Perhaps he thought it the best way to warm them and prevent their blood freezing; but, at all events, out they went in heavy marching order, with field tents and equipments,- and, after flittingnoiselesslypast the astonishedcamp, like an army of spectres,-what mortal musician could blow at "an enibrasure" (as some of the bandsmen call it) on such a day ?-they vanished amid.the snow, and went off to their invisible inspection. It is said that this small exercitation did not prove quite so beneficial to the health of. some of the men as might have been supposed, and that the Division has liad some casualties in this brisk engagement with King Frost. At night tihe the wind blew a gale from the north, and. for three hoxtxs. the* wind howled furionsly oer the camp, on wlich'the anow lay in sbme places seveial feet in depth.- At 10 p.m. the thermometer outside my hut stood at 18 deg. OnFLiiayYmorning, at 7a.m., the thermometer was at 22 deg.; at noon it had risen to 40 deg. ! The thaw rapidly set in, and in the evening it became ainiost warm. The snow is now melting fast, and the thermometer marks 48 deg. -The Rifle Brigade had races and sports on Wednesday, but the coldness of the day prevented a very large attendance. The extra 6d. a-day has been stopped from the pay of the men since the news of the peace.
DESPATOHES FBOM THE CBIMEA. (From the London Gaec o Friday, April 18.) WAR DEPARTMENT, Amm 16. ILord Panmure has received a despatch, of which the following is a copy, addressed to his Lordship by General Sir WiLiam Codrington, K.C.B. - "SEBASTOPOL, APRm L "Mly Lord,-There is nothing particular to report, except the continuance of the well-being of the troops. Even under the circumstances of- a month as severe in point of change and cold as any that wve have had there is no mnaterial increase in the number 'of sick. Though the numbers are higher, yourLordship will remember that draughts to the ex2ent of 4,000 men have latterly been sent up from Malta. Yet the whole of thbe month of March has been very cold and trying, from northerly winds and frost almost every night, and the thelmometer occasionally down at 13 and 18 degrees; and yesterday morning the ground was for a short time white with snow. "H aving received the signature of General Liuders to the armistice agreed upon by the allied Generals, the continuation of it has been prolonged till further orders. " Aboat from Her Majesty's ship Leopard entered the harbour from the sea yesterday, under a flag of truce, to carry on the communication across the harbour from our side. WVe had only one old and heavy Russian boat for this purpose. ThA conditions of the armistice did not permit to 'either party the use of the harbour; and the en3f±y 6f the boat of Her Mfajesty's ship Leopard was the result of communications between General Liuders and myself.'

CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION., TO THEI EDITOR OF THE TD}IES. Sir,-The evidence of Sir James Graham and Sir Francis Baring, this day, before the Civil Service Superannuation Committee, has proved the correctness of the views put forth by the civil servants for a reconsideration of their case. Sir James Grahanmstated that the superannuation abatements were intended to reduce salaries, although the Superannuation Act stated that the abatements were to reduce the charge for pensions. Moreover, he stated that the abatements from the salaries of servants who entered after 1829 should, he thought, be applied to pay the pensions of those who entered before 1829, and who never contributed to the ta. I would ask, is this common justice? Sir Francis Baring did not take so harsh a view of the case. He admitted that if it were proved that the deductions and interest upon the amount contributed were in excess of the amount of pensions of those.persons who were liable and paid the tax, the case should be reopened. ; This clashing of evidence from two ex-ministers who wera concerned in passing the existing act only:proves how desirable it is that the question should be settled on a broad basis, and, although the civil servants may be accused of disturbing the conditions of their entry.into the civil sei-vice, it is clear they have done right in appealing to the House of Conimons to investigate their case and renfove the anon-mlies and injustice under which. they labour. From all the evidence;before the committee there can be but one opinion -that,the abatements ought} no lonjge-r to be made for-snperannuation purposes. Your obedient servant, ' ,-. ': I ~ - A.

AfMEOBIAL CHURCH AT CO.N'SITANTfIOPIE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIEES. Sh,-A meeting in furtherance of the above object is advertised to be held at Willis's Rooms on the 28th of April. Will you allow me to make a suggestion for the consideration of tho committee through the medium of yonr columns ? My proposition refers to the internal decoration and other economy of the Memnorial Church. We have of late learnt to cease defacing the church of the living with monuments of the dead; and painted wvindowvs, memorial, brasses, and other similar tokens of the departed now adorn the place where God's honour dwvelleth. Let this pioposal then be made. Let the committee signify its willingness to receive thenamesofsuchre"imentsas arevwilling totake partinsome organized method or decorting the new church. Of course much depends upon the style in which the edifice is erected; yet in any case the distribution of such good offices might casily be made. Some regiments mnight undertake to fill the windows with painted glass; some to place between the indowvs, or to pave the floor with monumental brasses; others might contribute to the organ; others to encaustic tiles or marble for the chancel; one might present a pulpit, stalks, desk, or altar; another the communion plate, the font, or a peal of bells. Ina word; let the committee but make the appeal, and I am confident of the result. At all events, let us build a church worthy of our nation and our faith-built as it wvill be in the midst of a false creed and of an infidel people. I am, le., D. Z.

DAIRI-G BURGLARY li DERBYsHiRE.-On Tuesday morning another of those daring burglaries, which have re. cently been of frequent occurrence near the' confines of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, was perpetrated at the house of Mr. Samuel Hodgkinson, a farmer, residing at Beightonfields, which is adjacent to the Sheffield and Mansfield tuarnpike-road, about nine miles from Sheffield. Mr. Hodg-kin. son occupies an old farmhouse in a lonely situation, and about 3 o'clock on Tuesday morning was disturbed by a noise of some one mnoving about the premises. He got up and lighted a candle, but seeing no one about returned to bed again. He was shortly afterwards awoke by a loud crashing noise in the adjoining room, immediately after which eight men rushed into his bedroom. Their faces were concealed, some with masks and others with crape, and they were armed-one with a sword, two with pistols, a fourth with an axe, and the remainder with heavy bludgeons. They demanded the old man's " money or life," and on his refusing toteil where hismoney was and attemptingtoget ou of bed one of them knocked him down withaludgeo. Mrs. Hodgklnson was treated in the same savage manner, and was compelled to get out of bed and give up the key of the box containingthe money and valuables. The men snatched from the old woman a purse oontainin guwards of 51.,which she chanced toexhihitingivingupthekey, and also possessed themselves of Mr. Hodrkinsen's silver watch. Having ransacked the bedroom and found nothing else of value, seven of the men proceeded to another bedroom in an upper story, occupied by two youths, grandsons of the old couple, the other man remaining behind to keep guard over elr. and Mrs. Hodgkinson. For further security against any alarm being given the robbers dragged the maidservant, who was the only other inmate, from her own to the grandsons' bedroom, in her nightdress, and threatened to " cleave down" whichever of the three made the slightestalarm. The girl and youths were too much terrified to stir or offer any resistance, and the burglars proceeded to ransack the room. In the box of which they had obtained the key from Mrs. Hodgkinson they discovered nearly 1401. in gold ahd silver, some sllver spoons, teapots, &c. They possessed themselves of the money, and then inquired where the beerbarrel was kept. Being informed that it was in the dairy, they went thither and helped themselves, leaving the tap turned on. After threatening to shoot any of the inmates who should attempt to give anv alarm for half an hour, the bu-rglars decamped, taking with them the money, watch, and a pieee of beef, but leaving the teapots and other valuables oehind. A colier named Thomas Jarvis, whe> lives -bout half a nile distant, was some hours afterwards appreheaded by Mr. Tasher, superintendent constable of Eckington, and taken before Mr. T. Need, who remanded himn till Monday. Jarvis formerly worked for Mr. Hodgkinson, and is paaitively identified by one of the grandsons, who states that the wind blew the crapo on one side and revealed his face as he entered thie bedrcom with a lighted candle in his hand. No 'other person has yet been apprehlended on the charge. Mr. Hodgkinson is so terrified by the event that he durst not remain any longer in so lonely a house, and on Thursday removed his goods to the house of a son at the adjoining village of Barlbrourh. Two hours hfore the burglars entered Mr. Hodgkinson'O house a gaig of moo, helieved. to he the same, atte npted tc force an entrance into that of 3Ir. Marples, of Etaveley. a viilage a'cout three miles from Beightoss-fields. Mr. Marple-I was disturbed by the noisc and tired his gun, upon whicb the bulrg,lars nsade offi
ALDEBSHOT3J-CAMP. I The Queen. and Prince Albert were at Aldershott ytterday, and though, contraryr to general expectation, there iras no review-that event being reserved for this morning-ho4 scene was brilliant and animated, and the camp-wore that gay and festive aspect which a Royal vsit never faibs to impart. The weather; cloudy and unpromising at first, improved by bright degrees, until at last, as if in effulgent disclaimer of what Shakspeare has so unfeelingly said about the "uncertain glories" of the month of April, the sun shone forth with a power and constancy that put. his enenies, the clouds, to flight and made the day his own. The Royal partyleft Bclcinghamn PaLace at 3 o'clockreathed Farnborough about half-past 4 o'cloclc, and were received at the railway station by General Knollys, his staff anda guard of honour. The Queen, who wore a golden sash over her left shoulder, and on her riding hat a plume of military feathers, entered the carriage that was in waiting for her, and drove off amaid the loyal acclamations of a numerous assemblage. Arrived at the confines of the north camp, she alighted and mounted a fine chesnut charger, the Prince Consort riding on one side of her and Lord Alfred Paget on the other. General Knollys, with a brilliant staff, preceded the Royal personages, and a glittering group of equestrians, conspicuous among whom was the Countess of Desart, brought up the rear. on reaching the Club-house the cavalcade diverged into the plains that lie to the right of the common, and are encircled by a ring of heather-clad hills, once the home of timid hares and gentle plover, but now the haunt of riflemen, who resort thither. for target practice and awake the echoes with their sharp-ringing Minies, Here the troops were drawn up in double columns, offermig a front of a mile and a-half. The scene was beyond description brilliant and picturesque as the Royal visitors moved at a slow pace from reginent to regiment, the band of each saluting them with the National Anthem, while the men presented arms and the colours were drooped. The Queen appeared to enter thoroughlyinto-the spirit of theoccasion, and aclnowledged the salutations of her soldiers with a cordiality and condescension. which were generally remarked. Hers was no hurried or superfcial glance. She passed closely along the lines and examined with manifest interest the appearanceand discipline of the men. Nor could the scrutiny haie failed to afford her satisfaction; for the men, spruce and gallant in their new uniforms as English soldiers should bver be, went through their work admirably, and the steadiness and precision of their movements evoked the applause of all spectators. The inspection of the troops being comnpleted, the Queen repaired with her illustrious retinue to the highest of the hills in the vicinity, and, dismounting, took up her position where a flag-staff had been planted to mark the "saluting point." The regi ments then brought their "right shoulders forward" and the whole force defiled past Her Majesty in quick time and in open columns of companies, their bands playing national airs as they marched round the base of the hilL The order in which they advanced was as follows :-The SCth Regiment of the Line led the way, next came the 91st, and then; in succession, as here enumerated, the militia regiments of -Sussex, Glocestershire, Leicestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, the city of Dublin, the 5th Elthorne, Hertlordshire, 2d Surrey (with their venerable white goat), 1st Somersetshire, Cavan, City of London, and Cambridgeshire, which last regiment arrived from Ely only yesterday. Finally, the Antrim Rifles and third battalion of the Rifle Brigade passed at a swinging trot to the glorious old melodY of " Sir Roger de Coverley." It was altogether a brilliant and inspiriting spectacle, and the Queen and her subjects -appeared to enjoy it with equal zest. - : -At 6 o'clock the Royal party retired to the Pavilion, rwhere they took up their abode for the night.
COUI:T CIBCULAR. The Queen will hold a Piivy Council on Tuesday next at Buckingl?am Palace. Her Majesty and Prince Albert, accompanied by the Princess Royal and the PriiScess Alice, visited the Gallerv of the new Society of Painters in Water Colours in Pallmall, yesterday morning. In attendance were the Hon. Eleanor Stanley, the Hon. Lucy Kerr, Lord Alfred Paget, and Colonel F. H. Seymour. Prince Arthur and the Princesses Helena and Louisa took a drive in an open carriage-and-four. The Princess Poyal and the Princess Alice honoured the Duchess of Sutherland with a visit at Stafford House. Her Majesty and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort left Ruckingham Palace in the afternoon for the camp at Aldershott. Her Majesty and his Royal Highness were attended by the Countess of Desart, Lord Alfred Paget, and Colonel F. H. Seymour.

I THIT`M . : . .- TO THE EDITOR OR THE TiMES. Sir,-No idea was more reimote- froin my mind a few minutes ago than that of re4uestiiag:your insertion in Thic Times of any remarks of mine on'the discussion which has recently appeared in your -colimuns respecting tbe- miocn's rotary motion about her own axis; but it his just been pointed out to me that Mr. Symons, in' tlle piostscript-to his letter of yesterday, has referred to'a Mr. Hopkins, but without using the distinctive initials which might tlave, clearly shown what person of that name he intended to, designate. The gentleman for-whom this honour was intended is, I presiume, Mr. W. Evan Hopkins, the author of a work On Gco?ogy and Magnetism, by which, as well as by certain other writings, his name has become associated with geology. As the author of various geological memoirs, and as having recently presided over the Geological Sdoiety of London, my own name has likewise become associated -with the same science; and thus it has notunfrequently happened that some of Mr. Evan Hopkines's speculations have been most unduly attributed to myself ; and I believe that I even enjoyed, for some time, though most unwittingly, the honour, with some persons, of having written the work above referred to, although the scientific views there advocated are diametrically opposed to those which I entertain. Under these circumstances I think it right to state that I am not the person alluded to by Mr. Symons. I do not choose to incur the risk of being saddled with opiniqns which I regard with a sort of scientific horror, from whatever quarter they may emanate; nor do I assuredly wish to undertake the chivalrous task of supporting Mr. Symons against Newton, Laplace, and their whole host of followers.I That gentleman is certainly fighting against fearful oddsadds which might, one would have supposed, have suggested to him the thought that a little more exalted appreciation of the powers of the most distinguished philosophers, and a little more diffident appreciation of his own, together with a little elementary knowledge of dynamics, might have saved him from this dire collision with such antagonists. Ir. Symons has yet to learn the meaning of the term " rotary motion " in the sense in which every astronomer and mathematician has ever used it. Tne " fact that she (the moon) revolves round the earth, turning the same hemisphere towards it," does constitute her rotary motion about her own axis in the only sense in which the term has any dynamical significance, and the only sense in which astronomers have ever used it, notwithstanding the astounding boldness with which Mr. Symons aserts the contrary. It is not surprismg that philosophical errors should be as various as they are, but it is somewhat curious that the same error should sometimes appear -with almost as regular a periodicity as that of the moon herself. This view of Mr. Symons does not now appear for the first time, and, I doubt not, will appear again; but it would seem reasonable to suppose that each successive re-appearance of such an error would occur in regions more and more remote from educated minds. How is it, then, that on this occasion this periodical error assumes so bold a front in one who, by profession, is a teacher even of teachers? I leave this fat, however, for the specultion of others. Your obedient servant. w. HoKlNs. Cambridge, April 15.

Kll=y. 1fothing material has yet transpired which could thzow new light upon the terrible tragedy recently enacted in Westmeath. IDark suspicions there are in abundance, but that is alL It is to be hojed, however, that the first feeling of public horror Eill not subside nntil the arm of justice has.reached the, guilty parties, or, as in the case of Mr. O'uIwlaghau the other day, the crime will be all but forgotten, and the criminals left the full benefit of tie reactionary lethargy. By those who were present at the inquest and heard the faltering evidence given by one of the girls, it was believed that 6iM*1 more could have been told, and that the early.j6. sence of a master mind of the London detective force, acting ift conjunction wit-h the local poliie, might have unravelled a plot which still remiLs rapt in impenetrable mystery. - TEE CONVICT CLERGYN3A?N. The case of the Rev. W. Beresford, rector of the parish of Inniscaxra, county of Cork, came yesterday before the Vicar-General (Dr. Radcliffe) in the chamber of the Consistorial Court. The frst call was made upon a citation issed at the suit of tlie Lord Bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, to comipel the appearance of the Rev. Mr. Beresford, who -hi been convicted of forgery in England and sentenced to transportation for the term of his natural life, or of some one on his behalf, to show cause why he should not be deprived of the rectory, prebendage, and vicarage of Inniscrra, in the county of Cork. The proceedings, which svere merely formal, lastZl only a few minutes. 1;Fo day of hearmvg was appointed. It was understood that the creditors of the rev. gentleman will oppose the application. The parish has been sequestered for some years past to. satisfy the debts incurred by the rector. DEATH-.BED BEQUESTS In the Prerogative Court yesterday morning.a special proxy was handed in to the Judge, settieg forth the terms of an agreement or compromise between the pa3rties to the case of "Whitehead v'. O'Rourke," byJr which further litigation was to be avoided. The will in dispute rwas that of the Rev. Patrick O'Rourke, late Roman Catholic priest of Celbridge, by which all the funded and other property of which he stood possessed was bequeathed in trust for the erection of a Romai Catholic chapel in that parish, this disposition being alleged by the impugDants, the brothers of the deceased clergyman, to be at variance with all his previous intentions andcdeclarati9ns, and to have been obtained upon is - death-bed through the means of spiritual terrors exercised by the ReV. Dr. Whitehead, Vice-President of Maynooth, who, and the Rev. Dr. Renehan, President of that College, and D). M. O'Kelly, were appointed trustees by the same instrument. The cSse has stood for judgment since the 18th of February, and the result was looked forward to with considerable interest. 'Mr. Swift, proctor for the impugnants, handed into the court a special proxy signed by the four next of ;in, autho. rising their proctorto consent to have this will established, a compromise havingv been effected betwveen the parties. Judge catinge.-Is -there an affidavit of the due exe. cution of this?t "Mr. Swift.-I will have it made in the course of the day.

I think thero is some difficulty in the matters and that a very sernous question maybe raised in this case. I have given much attention to it, and was quite prepared to deliH er my judgment-not on this day, but after due notice haid been given to the parties. I am now told that the parties have compromised, and accordingly there is handed up to me a special proxy signed by the four next of kin, authorizing their- proctor to consent to have this wi.1 established. lNo do-ubt these parties-the next of kin-are all of full age, are under no disability, and have a rigght to - deal as they please with their own property; at the same time, after the faU examination of the case which took place in this court, and the evidence, which was given at very great length, it may be suggested that the Court ought not to be actuated by the consent.

I mnst presume, of course, that that agreeihent is one under which the next of kin will get out of the property of the deceased in the cause something substantial; Ithink it ought to be something very substantial. I ain not quite sure that I really am right in acting on this proxy; however, I do not think I ought to set up my opion against the opi;nions of all the parties in -the case, and accordingly I shall establish this wilL But, although I do not find it mentioned in the special proxy, I think it right to say that I shall give the next of kin full 'costs in the entire proceeding,- to be taxed betwe6n proctor &anproctor.

THE COPWPOBATION OF IO.NDO.YV TO TEIE EDITOE OF THiE m13S. Sir,-My attention has been caled to Mr. Bennoch's speech in the Common-hall, reported in T&e Tirnzs on, Tuesdy last, in which ho compares tho revenues andlexcpenditure of the Corporation of London with other places, and assumes, as the basis of comnparison, that the revenae.of the city is 400',0001., the co3t of administering it 114;OOOZ., and the population 128,000 persons. I cannot ascertainwoith. any certainty what are the particular items of revenue or costs of administration to which M-. Bennoch attributes. these sums, but I find by the aDcounti of the corporation. the following facts and figures, which certainly 3show. a verydifferent general result from that -which, llrE BennocWh speech implies. muring.the last sevenyears the avezageeceipt sof.the city, in resPect of its.corporate revenuea.andthe various prhlic funds it adminisbers as a trustee, amIount fI upwarls of l,OW,OOOdO? per annmn, and the cost of coDecting, administering, and applying this suns nse amounted. auuUlly to less than 50,0O1P., including the allowanoes to th2 Lord hIayor and shritrff, allowances ts committees, and salaries to city officers .

FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORMIIO.,-DF--,T.) PARIS, THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 6 P.M. In spite of the repeated contradictions given me by some of the Paris papers, either from ignorance of the facts or from unwillingness to speak of themin spite of the formal denals on the part of persons interested in the perpetuation of the enormous abuses, or, to use the term employed by one of the mnembers of the Paris Congress, the " infernal policy" of the Neapolitan and Pontifical Governments, I again affirm that all I have related on the question of Italy, as before the Congress, is substantially correct. The protocol of the 8th, or rather the minutes which formed the materials of that protocol, contained what I have stated, and even more. Count Walewski, at the express desire of the Emperor, introduced the subject in the manner I have mentioned, and is said. to have expressed himself, no doubt in moderate terms, but quite to the purpose. He intimated the hope that the Governments of Italy, 'whose policy had been incriminated, would feel it necessary to do something in favour of the people, and that nothing was more unfortunate than for a Government to be obliged to have recourse for its support to foreign troops, or to mercenaries. M. de Cavour spoke on the question at much length, and in the earnest manner I have described. He denounced in the strongest manner the Austrian occupation of Italy; and subsequently, it is said, presented a protest to the Congress. Lord Clarendon, who was under no necessity to employ gentle terms in de:scribing what he must have strongly felt, frankly and boldly declared that the conduct of the Pontifical Government was abominable, and he pro-4 nounced a severe and well-merited censure on the atrocious conduct of the King of Naples. He said thatthe opinion of the En-lisshpeople w,as-animolus -on the point; that no Government could or would attempt to allay it, or prevent it from expressing itself in a still more open manner. In a word, he is described as having spoken as becomes the representative of a powerful, a liberal, and enlightened nation. Count Buol spoke very warmly in reply to AL 'Cavour and Lord Clarendon. Hle maintained the necessity of a continued occupation of those parts of the Italian peninsula exposed to political agitation! and most likely to be under the influence of Revolutionists. He finally declared that he had no instructions on such a question, which he did not: consider was within the competence of the Congress; that he did not expect any such instructions,, and that he should not ask for them. His views were, I am told, supported by M. de Bourqueney, i who, it appears, took a decidedly Austrian view of the question. I am also informed that the Prussian! Plenipotentiary, whether from opposition to Austria, from the des,ire of regainingthe goed graces of: England, or from a sincere disapproval of the administration w;hich finds so warm an eulogvist in the repre-' sentative of Austria, supported M. Cavour and Lord: Clarendon to a certain extent. Count Orloff drew, as I have said, a distinction between contmnuous occupation irrespectively o f the wishes of the Governmnent in w.hose favour it w as, and intervention at the request of the Go.- vernment endangered by insurrection. So far as; regarded the KZing of Naples, he however de-; fended him throughout, but, as he had no, instructions on the point, as he had not turned his' *attention particularly to it, and consequently, vas not familiar with its details, he suggested' that his name should not appear in the protocol. All this, I repeat, was discussed w ith much w armth and with no small personality. Indeed, it was found necessary, on a review of the; 'notes wvhich were to compose the protocol, to soften' down the harshness of certain expressions, gene-' rally to modify them, and to omit the parts thati -were purely personal. The notes were accordingly D)ut into shape and form, and as a protocol was sent zound to the plenipotentiaries. The pruninga-knife had, however, been used rather freely, and certain members of the Congress are said to have objected to receiving them as a faithful report of what *ccurred, and to have intimated that they could not recognize their authenticity by their signatures.- The meeting at which the protocol of the 8th-the one I have described-was to be signed, was announced for Friday, but was postponed till Dionday,' the 14th, when, in its remodiiied form, but substan'tialaly the same as origially drawn up, it was read sand signed. It does not contain the i,prisrirnur -terba of the Plenipotentiaries-these are softened down a good deal, but it is, to all intents and pur-z poses, I am assured, a condemnation of the policy in question. You are awvare that another sitting was held yesterday. The Plenipotentiaries who took the chier part in it were Count Buol and MY. Cavour, between -whom the discussion was long and extremely animated, if not violent. It was continued, I believe, to a later holur than on the previous occasions, and I doubt whether they separated with any friendly feeling towards each other. Indeed, the meeting of yesterday, of which no protocol has been, or will be, drawn up, w as of a very stormy description. The Plenipotentiaries met for the purpose of signing the protocol of the proceedings of the Monday previous. M. Cavour leaves Paris to-night for London, where he will pass five or sin days, and he takes Paris on his way back to Turin. Lord Claren4 don leaves on Saturday morningf, M. de Buol for Vienna to-morrow, and Count OrloffT for Naples int a few days, to visit his son, who was wounded at SebastopoL. I have reason to believe that it is owing to the Emperor Napoleon that the Italian question was brought formally before the Congress:' M. Cavour had several interviews wih His MIajesty, who feels grat interest in the state of Italy. The Sardinian army will be brought home in English ships, at one and the same timae, if possible. It will not be reduced, but will continue with all its war equipments, and will very probably boe stationed at Spezzia and in the neighbour- hood, so as to be as close to Pseara and Sodena ' asspossible. the courage, zeal, and perseverance whicn M. Cavour has displayed during the tryingo period of the conferences will not diminish the sympathy felt in cngland towards his Government and country; and it would be surprising if the advocacy of the English Plenipotentiary in favour of hu anity, tolerance, and justice did not secure for himu the approbation of the 1nglish Iarliament and people. I have said that the feeling against Austria here is anythin h but friendly. At the dinner given by Prince tapoleon the other evening neither M. de Buol, M. Htubner, nor n. de Bourotueney, wrho is, justly or unjustly, regarded as decidedly Austrian in his tendencies, was present, while the representati'e of the Constitutional Government of Spain was among the most honoured guests. It is difficult to sulppose that this omission was net know-n, or disapprovedi by the Emperor. It would be improper to pass in silence one very probable result of the Paris conferences. Rusnia has never yet recognized the Government of Queen Irabelo a of Spain. It is reIharked that on several occasions, when they reacently met, Count Orloff and M. polozaga, the Soa- nish Amnbassador inParis,.appeared on veryfriendly terms with each other. .1 consider this fact as in some measure corroborative of the rumour that, before long, a Russian Envoy will be established in Madrid.; What effect will be produced. now in Italyby what has pas,ed in Paris it is not difficult to foresee. Diplomatic courtesies may render it necessary to soften down, and even suppress, the stronger terms in which the abuses of the PontiHical and Neapolitan rule and the Austrian occupation have been characterized, but sufficient will remain to proclaim to Europe the opinion of the representatives of its Governments. The solemn conclave of the great Powers has admittedthese misdeeds by the veryfact of discussing them; and, in turn, Italy has the right to demand. the redress of grievances yhich none have dared to deny, however diplomatic forms may have prevented any formal. resolution from being adopted. Italy is-in a state of effervescence, and cannot long continue so with impunity to its oppressors. The Congress has closed one great question, but another- no* less momentous is from this moment opened. If a movement breaks out in parts of the peninsula not under the dominion of foreign bayonets, what wiU Austria do? If Austria extend her baleful Srotectorate further what wil France and Englan , whohave just stigmatized the wretched Government of Naples, think it necessary to do? Will an Austrian army be allowed to occupy Naples, and an English fleet and a Sardinian army stand idly by ? This is hardly possible. A Council of Ministers was held yesterday at the Ttileries, at wvich the Emperor presided. The baptism of the Prince Imperial (ixed, as already stated, for the 9th of June) wil take place before the close of the session, so that the whole of the great bodies of the State wil be able to be present at it. The six French cardinals and a number of bishops are to be summoned to Paris to receive the cardinal from the Court of Rome who is to be charged to represent the Pope as godfather to the Prince Imperial. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received-.- "HAornuur, April 16.-The announcement made at different Bourses of a proposed new loan by Russia of 100,000 roubles is officially contradicted." "Bznm.S, April 17.-The Eniperor of Russia ratified the treaty of peace before leaving for M6scow. On his return ths Czar vill2 isit the provinces of the Baltic. Some Covernments of the Germanic Confederation have opened negotiations for tho purpose of coming to an understanding on the regime of the banks and the circulation of notes., The Protestant Biblical Society held yesterday its general annual meeting at the Lutheran Temple, in Riue Chauchat. M. Guizot, who presided at it, delivered the following speech "Gentlemen,-Called by your suffrages to the honour of presiding over your society, I have nothing new to tell you respecting its proceedings. You will hear the report of your committee on its labours, by which you will perceive that its activity continues and developes itself without any innovations, casualty, or clamour. I do not mean that our society attracts no attention, on the contrary, its merits are discussed, it is attacked, and the wvisdom and efficacy of its works are questioned. . It does .not reply to those attacks, and refrains from discussion or defending itself. Averse to all controversy, it remains silent and acts. Is it solely actuated by moderation, prudence, fear of the struggle, or hesitation to engage in, it? :No, gentlemen, a higher and more Christian motive directs our conduct. We place faith, entire faith, on the one hand, in the divine origin and the divine inspiration of the holy books, and on the other, in their efficacious action and their salutary influence over the human- soul. Those- two convictions, those two faiths, are intimately connected with each other. How is it possible not to believe in the moral efficacy of the Old and New Testament, when we believe in their divine inspiration? How is it possible not to confide in their influence over man when we believe that they emanate from God ? If you eiicounter anywhere doubts as to the moral efficacy of the holy books, hesitation or indifEerence to propagate them among men, you may be certain that faith and confidence in their divine inspiration is wantLng or tottering. Whoever believes God to be present, and scting, and speaking in those books cannot but wish that nen should assIsc at that presence of God, hear that voice of God, and feel its effect in their soul. We are aware of the difficulties that may arise Erom the reading and study of the holy books, and Df the bad use that may be made of a number of its passages and recitals. We 2now the obsourities, the pro. blems which the learned may meet with in them, and the inconveniences which prudent persons may anticipate from them. But those are mere embarrassments of human science and conditions of human infirmity. Above those embarrassments and inconveniences rises and soars the divine character of the holy books, the divine spirit which fils and animates them. The meaning is sometimes obscure,-difficult to understand and explain; but God is everywhere present-God is everywhere to be seen, heard, and felt; and through all the obscurities, aU the difficulties to be met with, the continual spectacle of the presence and action of God,the constant sound of Hlis voice cannot fail to strike, move, enlighten, and command mankind. Facts confirsn that confidence of faith. Whether we consider the history of nations or the private life of individuals, the moral efficacy and salutary power of the holy books glowingly manifest themselves. UIndoubtedly, even among nations where it is most assiduous and general, the reading of the holy books has not the effect of stifling the bad passions of men; it does not obviate all errors and faults. Man remains full of weakness and nice, even when con-. scious of the presence of God. But the habitual reading of the holy books preserves nations from the greatest perils; it prevents them from forgetting God. It has this advantagethat God remains for them,not an idea, a name, a system of philosophy, a riddle, bht the real and living God under whose eyes they constantly live, amid the struggles and casualties of this world. Religion and Christian faith have been and are still most ardently and obstinately attacked. What efforts have been made and are still making-how many books, serious or frivolous, clever or scurrilous, havo been and are still circulated for the purpose of destroying religion! Where has thatfearful struggle been maintainedwith the greatest energy and success? Where has Christian faith been better defended? It was where the reading of the holy books was a general and assiduous practice, in churches, in the interior of families, and in solitary meditation., It:is the Bible that coatends and triumphs most efficiently in thQ war between incredulity and faith. As to its action over isolated individuals, over the human soul, what period offers us a more strildng instance of it than the present one? we lately accompaniedcl Adolphe Bonod to his last abode. In the profound and general grief of those present could be seeL a profound and general sentiment of the magnitude of the loss. That sentiment is the measure of the influence exercised by AL Ionod over souls and, if- I may use an expression conveying my whole thought, of his Christian power. How did he acquire ithat power? Wlas it solely by his talent, his character, and devotedness to his mission?' No doubt, his talent, his character, and indefatigable devotedness had a share in his strong action over souls; but he derived it principaLly from his profound and active faith in the Bible, his constant and ardent study of the holy books, and the continual and constant use he made of them. He spoke of them and explained them incessantly, and was indefatigable in preaching thie Word of God. He began by testing himself and on himself the power of that word. He aso had his weaknesses, his languor, and his internat conflicts. It was with the aid of the holy books, by living assiduously with the Old and New Testament, that he overcame thoseperturbations of the soul and life. The holy books produced on his hearers the sanie effect they had had on himself. The object of one of his first works, LcUie, WaS principally to keep the Bible continually open before Crstians. This was the real source of his power over their souls. He would be the first to tell you so, if you could still hear his voice. That other excellent Christian, whose memory and virtues will long live in this temple, hL Verny, had likewise derived from the same source that moral authority, that penetrating influence which you have rall [so often felt. Those two great Christians pursued the same course. May they long remain united in our affection, respect, and regret, as they were united in their faith and their labours ! They have left us. God has calledthem off, no doubt because they had sufficiently accomplished their task in this world. Although they achieved a great deal, an immensity still remains to be achieved, and they are no longer with us. But we possess the holy books, in the name of which they spoke. Let us continue to place our faith in them, and to circulate them, as they did. The Bible will speak for them, for all and to all."

VlENNA, APRIL 14. The Sardinian memorial, and.the, remarks of the 'British press on the same, have raised a violent storm, and great is the indignation of Anstrians'in office that some of the members of the 'Conference lent an attentive ear to the complaints of such, a " faithless" Power as Piedmont. - The FranLforl Post Zeitiung, which is in intimate cdnnexion with one of the most influential persons in the Austrian Foreign-office, has two articles on-the Italian question, and they are well. worthy of notice, as they -serve to show the feelings of this Government towards England, Prussia, and Sardinia. The sub-stance of the articles in question is as follows *-In reality Thngland cares little about the welfare 'of Italy, but she wishes to arandize Sardinia. If the German press approve of the idea, it is simply because it is oblivious of history and of the interests o. the great fatherland. It-is ridiculous that Sardinia should claim to represent Italy in the same way as Austria does Germany. Until Prussia 'was invited to attend the Piris-conferences, Austria alone represented the German Confederation; but, if the wishos of the various Italian Governments were inquired into, it would be found that not one of them would desire to have Sardinia for its proxy. When, after the Congress of Soissons,* there was a question of an alliance between the house of Savoy and the F?rench and Spanish Bourbons, the foUowing remark was madet. -" The house of Savoy is 'ambitious an desirous of aggrandizement. It is one of those families which must seek to in, crease its power in Italy, as 'Prussia is doing in Germany; its Prnces feel themselves uncomfortable in the narrow limits assigned to them." The French and Spanish Cabinets took advantage of this "noble ambition," and when, in 1733, they were preparing to go to war with Austria, it -was stated that their object was to break the power of the Emperor, the natural rival of the house of Savoy. The following passage occurred in the diplomatic document to whlichM. Capefigue had access :-" If German influence declines in Italy, who is likely to profit by it? Is Piedmont not on the frontier of the Duchy of M.ilan, and if Turin extends its hand to Milan may not-a great State be formed?" The Austrian publicist, after affirming that neither the Italian rulers nor their subjects have any bias in. favour of Piedmont, makes various defamatory charges against its Princes. They are accused of having distinguished themselves for many centuries by their faithlessness. We are told that Piedmont. (Sardinia) is a parasitic State, which has acquired size " by taking advalitage of circumstances, by temporizing,. by betraying its allies, and by selling its- assistance during political wars." During the vhole of the eighteenth century Piedmont was alternately the ally of France and Austria, and by her vacillating policy she managed. to enlarge her territory. After this violent attack, *the Austrian writer indulges in the following tirade. against Parliamentary government :-" In Italy Parliamentary government isthe firefromwhich the revolutionary element obtains warmth ; it promotes the dislike of Germany to Austria, and increases -the hatred felt for Catholicism." The German Protestants and Liberals are reminded that the Dukes of Savoy persecuted the Waldenses withfire and sword, and that even in 1825 the King of Sardinia issued an ordinance that no one should be allowed to learn to read and write who was not in possession of 1,500 . lire (50l.) The second article is a vile compound of insinuations against E!ngland and abuse of her foreign policy. WVe are still much in the dark as to what has occurred in Paris, but credible information has reached me that Count Cavour did not attempt to bring the Italian question before the conferences until after peace had been concluded. Austrian statesmen ridicule the idea of Parma and Modena beig annexed to Sardinia, and declare that no tern toral changes can be made in Italy unless by force of arms. Austria and Naples are not oni the best possible terms at present, but still the former would not fail to protest against any armed interference in the internal affairs of the latter. It is impossible to speak positively on such a matter, but there is reason to believe that when a high personage in this empire afew months ago gave the Ring of Naples some friendly counsel, it was somewhat ungraciouisly received. The version of my informant was, that His Neapolitan Majesty was of opinion that " Austria would do well to give example instead of precept." The " cemetery question " greatly occupies the public, and may possibly lead to a serious misunderstanding between the Catholic hierarchy and the Imperial authorities. The Archbishop of Vienna and his coadjutors, the Bishops of Linz and St. i Polten, rsase great difficulties whenever it is proposed to inter a Protestant in the general burialground. A few days ago the body of a child (a Protestant) was privately buried in the churchyard of Neu-Lerchenfeld, and the 1 corpse of a man (also a Protestant) was "huddled away" in a corner of the burialground at Weinhaus.: The arbitrary conduct of the Archbishop has excited the indignation of the Protestants and Greek Christians, and they declare that the Roman Catholic hierarchy has no right whatever to interfere with the cemeteries, which are the private property of the different corporations or parishes. In 1783 the Emperor Joseph II. took from the Vieina Protestants a burialground which they had purchased, and established "general" cemeteries, in which, by the Monarch's special orders, the mortal remains of aU descriptions of Christians were in future to rest. The richer Protestants and Greeks at once purchased pieces of ground in the new cemeteries, and had fauldly vaults constructed, which will be entirely useless if their descendants are not to be buried in them. We are curious to see whether the Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs will have the courage to defend the rights of the corporation of Vienna against the Archlbishop. It appears to me that it would be a dead robbery to deprive the non-Catholics of ground which they purchased from the municipality, and which to all intents and purposes is their own private property. The Austrian papers contain long articles on the military occupation of the Danubian Principalities, and most of them state (after Le Nord) that " the Austrian troops are already evacuating them," but this is not the case. The furlough men are returning home, but the number of battalions has not been reduced. The Ost-Dautsc7te Post, in a semiofficial article, saysthat the presence of the Austrian troops is not oppressive for the inhabitants of Moldaviaand Wallachia,butthe writer cannot possiblyeoxpect persons who are in possession of their five senses to give credit to his statement. The state of siege will probably be maintained until the Hospodars demand its abolition. Baron Koller goes to Bucharest and .Jassy as the Austrian member of the commission. According to private letters from Constan. tmnople, Mr. Alison, the Oriental Secretary to the E mbassy, is to represent England. Yesterday there was a great evening party, at which the Emperor and Empress were present, in the Palace of the Princess of Auersperg. His Majesty is about to give a handsome French fan to the Empress, and the form of the fan, as also the groups of figLures painted on it, were represented by members of the aristocracy. The whole thing was extremely well got up, and gave the more satisfaction to the company as it was new. Tw i French pieces were played by the young nobles, and Levassor, who is quite the man of the day, sang one of his best songs. M. Cornelius Bujanovics, who was charged with having poisoned seven persons, has been acquitted by the Criminal Court at Pesth " ab instan.tia" (for want of proof). The coumsel for the Crown will i refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, andaM. Bujanovics must remain in custody until the sen- I tence of that tribunal has been given. It must be understood that an acquittal " ab instantia" is not equivalent to our "Not guilty." The verdict means, that the defendant's guilt has not been satisfactorily proved, but not that he is innocent. It is the Scotch " Not proven." The Lombardo-Venetian Railroad shares are to-day at 29 per cent. premium. A great Vienna banker received orders on Friday to buy 2,000 shares for Paris houses at 20-22 per cent. No shares were to-j be had at the price fixed, and on Saturday the premium was as high as 32 per cent. I * June 14th, 1728. t Capefigue's Louis XYV., Vol. IL, page 46.

On the 2Gth ult. attention was drawn to a clause in a bill brought in by the Lord Chancellor for assimilating the mercantile law of the united, kingdom intended to repeal the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds, which provides that no contract involving 10l. or upwards is valid unless made by some - note or memorandum in Wvriting. This has alwrays -been acted upon in-London and regarded with great favour, but in Manchester and elsewhere it has falleni into disuse, while, with reg,ard to Scotland, the staA tute has no application'whatever. The question was, should 'the Scotch law be made -to conform to the 1nglish, or the English to the Scotch ? The Chancellor decided in favour of the former; but; looking at the fact that all. the principal transactions of the empire centre here, it seemed questionable whether it would' be wise to disturb the London system, unless some strang objection to it could be urged upon principle. 'This; however, was not possible; 'and, as the question was obviously one of expediency only, it was recommended that the merchants and traders of the metropolis should not allow the clause to pass -with! out clearly coming to an understanding as to its desirableness or otherwise. It is now understood thai the feeling is generally adverse to the p1'opose4 change; and a petition against it, of which the' follotuno is an abridgment, is in course of signature: ' That a bill has been introduced the first section of which purposes to repeal the enactment I That no contract for the sale of any goods, wares, and merchandises, for the price of 10. sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good; except the buyer shall accept part of the goods so sold and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to - bind the bargain or in part of sayment, or that some note or I memorandum in writin- of the same bargain be made andc signed by the parties tote charged by such contract, or their E agents thereunto lawfuUy authorized.' I, I " That the mercantile business in the city of London has grown up under, and has adapted itself to, the provisions of the said act, and, w hile your petitioners apprehend great risk and danger from a departure from this practice, they* are unable to discover any advantage in the proposed alter ation.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~gra "That the lawv imposes no unnecessary technicalities on contracts ; they are required to be in writing, but may be in any form convenient to the parties, and are frequently effected by letters between the principals. "That in London a large part of the contracts are negotiated by brokers, and by the present practice aU contracts entered imto by a broker are sent to principals, who are entitled to reject the same within 24 hours, if 'not in conformity with the intentions of the parties. " That these provisions insure certainty and give confidence in transactions in business, the importance of which can scarcely be appreciated. " That your petitioners conceive that, notwithstanding the proposed alteration of the law, all contracts of importance will continue to be reduced to writing ; but your petitioners will lose the protection the law now gives them. " That if the law shall be altered your petitioners may be called on at a lapse of many months to perform contracts of which they have no knowledge, arising out of raiscon$ ception of those with whom they have been engaged in treaties, or of brokers or agents, to say nothing of the risk of fraud and collusion on the part of brokers and agents, the result of which must obviously be an increase of litigation and perjury. " That a large proportion of the contracts entered into contain stipulations as to the period of the arrival, of tlhe shipment, or the delivery of goods, besides provisions as to their quality and price;* and the value of the contract mainly depends on these details. That, unless th~ose stipn- lations are reduced to wtriting, there can be no certainty~ that buyer and seller are agreed upon the contract they have entered into. "That your petitioners attach great value to the principle now acknowledged, that none but wvritten contracts are valid in law. Those who ehoose to rely upon an honourable mutual understanding can now do so, but in practice it is rarely ever done, from a sense of its inconvenience. The measure now contemplated would not probably alter the practice of using written contracts, but would deprivethe merchant of the security he now possesses in the knowledge that he is bound by no agreement which has not been' accepted and revised by him, or which he has not had the opportunity of revisig.". The colonial produce-markets during the week have been generally well supplied, and the 'tansactions have been to a fair extent.' The demand fbr sugar at the commencement was very liniited, the dealers showing little inclination to operate;- andc a decline took place of 6d. to is. .per cwt. Subsequently the quantity offered has been small, only one parcel of Cossipore being'offered to-day, which went at better prices, while by private contract' a moderate business has been transacted at fuller rates, the decline now being about 6d. per cwvt. from last week, while the market has closed with an improving tendency. Further quantities of the new crop of plantation Ceylon coffee have been brought to auction, the good coloury: kinds realizing extreme rates, while the inferior 'qualities' have gone off more slowly, without any material alteration. The native sorts have been disposed of at lower quotations. The inferior descriptions of Bengal rice have been purchased to some extent, partly for export, at about former terms. Some' of the ne-w crop was offered at sale to-day, aid realized higher rates than were generally anticipated. The scarcity of the middling and high refractions of saltpetre has induced a demand for these kinds at very firm prices, while the good and fine descriptions, from the effect of large stocks and increased arrivals,' are almost unsaleable. Acargoofnitrateof soda of commonquality, suitable for'agricultural purposes, has'been sold at a reduction. In spices th'ere havebeenlarge sales, Nvhich went off generally at lower rates. AAt the tea sales on Thursday great flatness was apparent, and a further slight decline took place in many descriptions of green. By private contract lower prices have also been accepted for blackish leaf' congous, the supply of which, from the late numerous arrivals, has been very large. Common congouis quoted at 9d. per lb. The prospectus has been issued of a Metropolitan Milk Company, with a capital of 50,0001., in 101. shares.

LAW REPOBT. ROLLS' COURT. CaAWCEPv-LANE APRTL 18. TYM V. THE GOVERMOR AIND CO0PANY OF TEE BANX OF ENGLAND. (Beforc the MASTM of the RIois.A The facts of this case, which came before the Court on a prayer that the plaintiffmight be declared entitled to a sum Of about L4001. Rank of England stock, were singular, snd as follows:-In the year 1830 a person named Btobert John Clarke, passing in society as a gentleman, married a Miss Mary Barrow, from whom, some short time afterwards, he separated. In or about the besinning of the year 1840 Clarke became acquainted Vith the plaintiff, Miss Tee, and shortly afterwards professed to marry her, at St. George's, HanoverEquare, under the name of Arthur Henderson Clarke, vhereas his real name was Robert John Clarke, and his rst wifewasstill alive. FromlS40up to the time of Clarke's death, in 1855, the plaintiff lived -with Clarke in dward-street, Portman.squ73re, being received by his acnaintances as his ;ife, and behievig herself really and legeliyto be sO. During this interval Clarke and the plaintiff ironm time to time invested their mutual savinDsi the joint names of Arthur Hendeson Clarke and brs. Earah Clarke, both names being incorrect, though not to the knowledge of the plaintiff. When Clarke died, however, in 1S55, his will, dated the 1th of November, 1845, was found, and in it he described himself as Robert John Clarke, and appointed the plaintiff his sole executrix, by her own name of Sarah Tee. It was then discovered by the plaintiff, for the first time, that when she sup. pcs:d herself to have been married to Clarke he already had a wife, who it nowv appeared had died in the year 14,- but, inasmuch as the plaintiff had not subrequently to that date been remarried to Clarke, she, of course, merely retained her identity as MiRs Tee, and had mo claim to the distinction of being Mrs. Clarke. Under these circumstances, and because the moneywas invested by Clarke in fictitious names, both as regarded himself and his pretended wife, the Bank refused to pay out the money to that lady, except under direction of the Court, and it was tl surmount this difficulty that the plaintiff now applied to the Court for relief. His HoNso7, after hearing all the circumstances stated above proved by affidavits, considered the plaintiff entitled to the decLaration she prayed, and made an order upon the Bank of England to that effect. Mr. Jessel appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Ersline for the di-ectors of the Bank, by whom no opposition was offered.
VICE-CIHACELLORS' COURTS. FRIDAY. APRIL 1R DALTON V. MILLUNGTON. (Befow VtTnzT .Sir R T2 RTn .V I Mr. NADER appeared upon this petition, but was stopped by The VICE-CILUNCELLOR, who said that, in reading over the petitions on the evening before they came on, as he had occasion to do, he was perfectly ashamed at the incompetency of solicitors in drawing them. The petition was full of irrelevant statements, whle material matters were not even referred to. These petitions sbould be settled by barristers, and he (the Vice-ChanceUor) was ver- anxious that the costs of such settling should be allowed by the taxing master. The petition must stand over to be amended, and if that were done by Mr. Nalder thejpetition would then be in an intelligible shape. BESS_rT V. BIDDLES. This suit has been before the Court for many years, and is to administer the estate of a gentleman named Biddles, who died possessed of property to the amount of 100,0001. at least. Four petitions w,ere now presented in the suit, the object being to distribute n portion of the fund in court, becoming distributable by reason of the death of an annui*ant. In one of the petitions, a part of the fund to be dealt with appeared to have been dealt writh in another suit, in tituted with reference to the personal estate of one of the legatees, and the petitioner asked that such fund nioht be transferred to the suit of " Bennett v. Jackson" which was attached to the Rolls Court. M-. R. R. Deane appeared upon three of the petitions; Mr. Boyle appeared upon the fourth; Mr. H. F. Bristowe appearedifor the sole surviving plaintiff, who was also sole surviving executor and trustee of the wilL The VIcE-CuA_NcELLOR said, that he considered the presentation of three of the petitions, where one would have been sufficient, a most unnecessary course. All these etitions must stand over until the next petition day. With respect to the petition which asl,ed the transfer of a portion of the fund from this suit to another suit before another branch of this court, that order must be made by the Lord Chancellor orby the Lords Justices (Before Vice-Chancdlor Sir W. P. WooD.) ARLSOLD V. M1AYOR, ATDERME-, AND BURGESSES OF C.nAVESEN-D. The question in this case was as to the effect of a judgment in a court of equity upon the property of a corroration. The facts were as follow:-By an act passed in the 9th of GeorgeIV., for the purpose of rebuilding, improving, and maintaining the town quay of Gravesend, the mayor, jurats, and inhahitants of Gra-esend were empowered to borrowi money, not exceeding 7,0001, npon mortgage of the tolls, rates, and duties authorized to be levied by the act. Soon after the passinug of this act the mavor, jurats, &c., borrowed from the plaintiff 10 sums of 1001., for the purpose of the act, and delivered to him 10 several mortgages or assign,ments of such share or proportions of the rates, tolls, and duties as the sius then borrowed bore to the whole sum authorized to be borrowed undee the act. A bond, dated October 16, 1S28, under the commnon seal of the mayor, &c., was executed and delivered to the plaintiff, by which the corporation bound themselves and their successors in the penal sum of 2,0001., conditioned to be void upon payment to the plaintiff, his executors, administrators, and assigns, of interest at 5 per cent. upon the sums secured by the abovementioned mortgages or assignments. By the Municipal Corporation Act, the 5th and 6th of Wiliam IV.J chap. 76, the corporate name of the mayor, jurats, &c., was changed to that of " the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the borough of Gravesend." Interest was duly paid to the plaintiff up to the 16th of April, lS;O, since wnch time it had remained in arrear. The plainiff, on the 19th of March, 1852, recovered judgment in an action of debt upon the bond against the corporation. The plaintiff's judgment had been duly registered on the 20th of March, 1852, in the Court of Common Pleas. At the time of entering up this judgment the corporation were possessed of certain freehold, copyhold, andleasehold property, and also of the zuexpired remainder of a term of 99 years, granted by a lease d.ated the 7th of A-ugust, 1851, from the officers of Her hfajesty's Ordnance, on behalf of Her Majesty, as to a ferry across the Thames to West Tilbury, in Essex. The corporabunhbad subsequently granted an underlease of this property. Other jud,gments had been entered up against the corporation of Gsavesend in priority to that of the plaintiff The ulaintiff, after obtainin" his jud"ment, had, in accord. ance avith the statute the 8th and 9th of lliiam IlL, chap. 11, suggested upon the roll in the action nonpayment of the arrears of interest as breaches of the condition of the bond, and sued ont a writ of edegZt, directed to the sheriff. The sheriff had caused the term granted by the lease of the 7th of August, 18-51, to be extended and delivered to the plaintiff. In order to determine the right of the plaintiff under the writ of eleit, a special case was agreed unon and argued in the Court of ;onmmon Pleas. Judgment was given mn tbis speciasl case to the effect that, by rtue of the 5th aqnd 6th of MWiliam 3?V., chap. 76, sec. 92,executioncould notbehad against the property of acorporation acquired since that statute in satisfaction of a debt contracted by the old corporation. The plaintiff had subsequently filedthe present bill, by which he sought to establish his judgment as a charge upon the property of the corporation comprised in the lease of the 7th of August, 1851 (subject to the underlease and payment of the judgment creditors prior to the plaintiff), and to have the benefit of the remedies in equity, provided by the judgment statute of the 1st and 2d oI Victoria. chap. 110, sec. 13. 3fr. RoLT and Mr. SPEED, for the plaintiff, contended that lie had not been deprived of his rights by any act of Parliament which had been passed subsequently to the date of his security. Upon the execution of the bond the plaintiff had an inchoate right which could at any time be ripened (by obtaining judgment upon the bond) so as to affect property of the corporation in their possession at the time of entering up judgment, though acquired by them subsequently to the date of the security. Hisrights were not affected by sections 92 and 94 of the 6th and 6th of William IV., chap. 76 (the Municipal Corportion Act), but rather preserved, and, at any rate, corporations were enabled by the subsequent act, the 6th and 7th of William IV., chap. 104, sec. 1, to execute any deed for securing repayment of any debt or obligation contracted by or on bebalf of the 7ody corporate before the passing of the Municipal Corporation Act-the Legislature thus expressly recognizing preexiting obligations as to which doubts had arisen upon the former statute. The decision of the Court of C:omon Pleas in no way concluded the present question, which was astro theulaintiff's rights inequityunndersection 13 of the 1st nd2d of Victoria. chap. 110, while at common law the question w as whether an degf creditor had a right, under sectthon 11, to sue out execution against corporate property. Mtoreover, the act 6th and 7th of William IV., chap. 104, was not even alluded to upon that occasion, and there was no power cf appealing from the decision, as error could not be assigned upon a special case at common law. Mr. WsITLCOCx and Mr. H. STr\N-s, for the defendants, the corporation, relied upon section 92, of 5 and 6 Williamn iV., chap 76, which directed that the rents and profits of all hereditaments and the proceeds of all moneys payable to a body corporate should be carried to a certain fund called the " borough fund," which was to be held in trust for and dedicated to certain purposes, and could not be dealt with except in the precise way pointed out in the act. The corporation had no power to touch this fund for the purpose of satisfying creditors, nor was the plaintiff, at the time of entering up his judgment, entitled to charge the corporation property acquired subsequently to the M1unicipal Corporation Act. They also contended that this was concluded by the decision in the special case at common law. 3Mr. RowT replied. The VIcE-CtscE;LLOR said that he would give judgment on Tuesday next. 3AJRNARD v. . sBAwCS1A BTLAE BATHUR5T IUSr,S LASIAN GOLD 3MTMG COMPANY. The opening of this case was commenced. The suit is insttuted by the plaintiff on behalf of himself and all other the shareholders in the above company (being one of the Miany " bubble " c2mpames started during the prevalence of 'the gold-mining mama), for the purpose of obtaining a deetaraion of the Court that the original promotion of the company was fraudulent, and that the company itself hal turn out have been improperly expended. A petition for winding up the company, nnder the Winding-up Acts, prescnted by another shareholder, also comes on to be heard * ith the cause. Mr. Rolt, Mr. W. M.

COTMT OFOUT3=S BENCIL WEsTmn;srn, ARm1S. BENETT V. THlOMPSOll. (SWIngs in Banco, beforc Lord CWBELL and JuMm ( FSitingz 1aT . P and CROMPTON.) MBr. SLADE moved, pursuant to leave.reserved at the trial, for a rule to show cause why the verdict which had been found for the plaintiff on the second plea should not be entered for the defendant, or why it should not be entered distributively. The action was brought to recover damages for a nuisance by smoke issuing from the defendant's factories. The defendant pleaded tie generalissue, and also a 20 year' user. The plaintiff now assigned to the second plea, an the defeiidant rejoined thathowas not guilty. At the tral, -which took place before Mfr. Serjeant Channell, at the last assizes for the county of Somerset, the plaintiff proved the fact of the smoke issuing from the defendant's chimneys, constituting the nuisance of which the plaintiff complained; but it was found by the jury that the defendant had proved r of one of the chimneys for more than 20 years. Upon this finding a verdict had been entered forthe plaintiff on the second issue ; and.the object of the present .application was to have theverdict entered for the defendant on the second plea, or, at all events, distributively. Lord CAPBELLsaid the learned counsel might take a rule n2si. IN THE MATTER OF THE ARBITRATION BETWEEN ANDREWS AND CROSSLEY. Mr. D,AY said he was instructed to show cause against a rule obtained by Mr. Aspland to set aside an award upon the ground that it was invalid. He (Mr. Day) was unable to sy anthinginsupport of the award, which vwas as bad as it could be. The umpire had awarded compensation to. be paid to the outgoing tenant (Smith), instead of to the Inadlord (Andrews). Hle would therefore consent to the rule being made absolute. Mr. AsPLAND applied that the matters in dispute should be referred back to the umpire, and that some terms should be imposed as to the payment of the costs of taking up the award. His (Mr. Aspland's) client had paid 401. in taking up the abortive award. Lord CAwPBETA said that, as neither party was to blame,. the costs of taking up the abortive award should be borne eqLuaPy by the parties. Rule absolute accordingly. IN TIE MATTER OF AIREED JOSEPH CHEISTIE. Mfr. PIERCE appeared to show cause against a ruale which had been granted for an attachment for serving a party with what purported to be a copy of a writ, but was not so. The learned counsel now stated that his client much regretted: what had occurred, and apologized to the Court for taking the advice of an incompetent person. He was willing to pay the costs to which he had thereby put the party, and hoped the Court would accept the apology and sanction the proposed settlement. Mr. SLEIGHI consented to this proposal. Lord CAXPBELL said that, as it did not appear that there was any evil intention, the arrangement would be sanctioned. Rule discharged on payment of costs. DUGDALE V. THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VICE. William Dugdale, the same party who on the first day of term made an unsuccessful application to the Court for a criminal information, moved for a rule calling upon the secretary of the Society for the Suppression of V ice to show cause vwhy the applicant should not be at liberty to appoint some impartial erson to inspect certain printed books belonging to him w ich had been seized by the agent of the defendant upon the suggestion that they vere immoral and obscene publications. The applcant read an affidavit, in which he stated that his name was William Dugdale, and that he lived at No. 16, Holywell-street, in the Strand. He had brought an action against the secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. The defendant's agent, acting under a warrant, had seized and taken away from the aplicant's premises printed and bound books of the value of 3,)001., under the idea that they were immoral and obscene publications, whereas, in point of fact, - as the applicant deposed, the books were not unimoral and obscene. The object of the present application was that some impartial person should be appointed to exaamine the property, and take a list, so as to be able to report to a jury, on the trial of the action, whether any of the books were immoral and obscene. Lord CAIIPBELL.-I understand you to say that you have brought an action for the recovery of the books, and that you have made such an application and been refused? The applicant said that was so. Lord CAMPBELL.-YOu may take a rule to show cause why you should not be as liberty to appoint some one to do What you desire. Rule isii granted. ROBERTS NXD OTHERS V. HAYES. SirF. KELLY (with whom was Mr. Whateley, Q.C.) moved, pursuant to leave reserved at the trial, for a rule calling on the plaintiffs to show cause why the verdict,which had been found in their favour with 2,5001. damages, should not be set aside and a nonsuit entered. The action was brought by the plaintiffs, who were interested as reversioners in certain houses at West Bromwich, to recover damages from the agent of the Earl of Dartmouth, for injuries done to the plaintiffs'houses by reason of the defendanfts negligence in the working of coal and iron 3nines in the vicinty. The question now raised for the consideration of [the Court arose on the construction of certain sections in the West Bromwich Enclosure Act, 1601. By the 19th section the lord of the manor, now represented by the defendant, was to be at liberty to enter the waste land to be enclosed under the act, andto get coal and ironstonethere, on making full satisfaction to the persons whose allotments should be injured, and by the220th section the lord of the manor wasnotto sink any shaft, in order to get coal or iron, within a distance of 40 yards of any dweling-house erected or to be erected on the common, nor to work any mine within a perpendicular distance of 40 yards from the foundations of any dwellig-house. In the present instance it was proved that the defendant's mines had been worked in the usual manner and with all care and skiUl, and they did not appreach the plaintiffs' houses laterally within a distance of 100 yards. So great was the anxiety shown not to injure the plaintiff's property, that though he was only limited to keep the mines 40 yards perpendicularly below the foundations, the defendant had kept them as low as 270 yards. Under these circumstances the learned counsel contended the action could not be sustained. Lord CAMPBELL said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. BUSINESS OF THE COVUT. Lord CAaMPBELL said, that to-morrow (this day) the Court would take the cases in the Crown Paper, and would afterwards Proceed with the case of " Dunbar v. Smurthwaite," inthe IRew Trial Paper. BATI COURT. (Sittings at lyisi Prius before Mr. Justice COLERIDGE and Consmorn Juries.) JA}CKSON V. BARHAM. Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Bennett were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Couch for the defendant. This was an action brought under the Common Law Procedure Act, to recover 221. due upon an I 0 U to one Basil Francis. It appeared that the plaintiff had accepted a bill for the accommodation of Francis, and that Barham had discounted the biU for Francis, giving him an I OU for 221., part of the amount for the bill When the bill became due Francis did not take it3up, and the plaintiff was obliged to pay it, and he now, under the recent act, brought this action against the defendant as the debtor of Francis. It seemed that Francis had been the manager of the Crown and Sceptre, at Greenwich. The defence was a set-off for business done by the defendant as an accountant for Francis. Ultimately the jury retumed a verdict for the plaintiff for 221.
COTJRT OF COMi}ON PT,F,AS. WESTM,fSTER. APRm lS. LE1T V. MADT,UALE. (Sittings ir. Banco, Easter Term, before Lord Chief Justice JER A-s and Justices CRm;SSELL, CRowniER, and kVmLmLE9: This was an action tried before Lord Chief Justice Jervis at the Gildhall, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 2,0001. Mr. HInL, Q.C., now moved to set aside the verdict and to enter a nonsuit. It a peared that the plaintiff, a gen- tleman living in the neighbourhood of Carlisle, in Cumber-' land, employed a sharebroker at Liverpool named Gladders to purchase for him bonds in the Hartlepool Docks to the amount of 2,0001., for which sun he remitted Gladders a letter of credit on a bank at Liverpool to meet the purchase. The defendant was acquainted with Gladders, and on the morning that the letter of credit arrived he asked Gladders to accommodate him for the day with the amount of the letter of credit, to meet some payments for cotton, promising to return the amount. In consequence, Gladders went with the letter of credit to the bank, accompanied by the defendant, where, having obtained the money, he handed over the 2,0001. to the defendant, on the distinct promise to repay it in a day, as Gladdens wanted the money for the specific purpose for which it had been sent-namely, to pay for the bonds. At the close of the day the defendant came to Gladdens and handed him a statement of account between them, showing Gladders to be defendant's debtor in the sum of 1,40!., for which he tendered him a receint, and 60!. balance in cash the residue of the 2,0001., notwithstanding the ineffectual protest of Gladders. The money due on the bonda not being paid, the plaintiff brought his action to recever the money From the defendant as money had ard receied to his use, and recovered a verdict. The learned ceunsel now contended that there was no specific property in any particular money, and that the plaintiffcould not say the specific money was his which the defendant had kept in payment of his debt from Gladders. The CouRT thought that the money was the plaintiff's money, which the defendant had got under a promise to return it, and he was responsible for it. The plaintiff could, therefore, recover it as money had and received to his use. Rule refused. MOUTON V. 0CE2NIG. This was an action tried at Westminster before the Chief Justice, in which the plaintiff recovered a verdict ior 301. 16s. 8d. Mr. Serjeant AmnaYSON now moved to set aside the verdict, and enter a nousuit. The action was brought by the plaintiff as landlord for rent under a demise, which the plaintiff; among other objections, failed to prove. It was submitted that the plaintiff was bound to prove the lease. The COURT refused the rule. S3{ITE V. THE MAYOR, ALDERSJER, AND CORPORATION OF HARWICH. This was an action which came on to be tried at Surrey, and was referred. Mr. Serjeant Ssrxs now moved for a rule to enter a non. suit. The action was brought on a memorandum of agreement between the plaintiff, who is a contractor, and the defendants, whereby the plaintiff bad contracted to build some works, which were to be done in two portions on certain terms. Theplaintiff,in his' declaration, complained that the first portion was net p aid for, and also that as t, the second portion the defendants had not obtained the assent of the Conunissioneis of W-oods and Forests to enable him to finish the work, whereby-he-had sustained damage.

The declaration at the triAl was amended by adding a count for money had and received, anda witness was called top prove oathrside, suggeste thio the jury that this evidence was all an invrention and afterthought, suddenly got n}> to support the-count added, and the jury, being of that opinion, found a verdict for the defendant.

GORDON V. WMITERAVEN. T his was an action tried at the Guildhall, when a verdict 1 was found for the plaintiff for 5621. Mr. HUIL, Q.C., now moved to set aside that verdict and for a new trial. The question was whether the contract set out-in the declaration was proved. The plaintiff had agreed to sell to the defendant the plant and materials of a builder, at a valuation by the plaintiff and a person to be provided by the. defendant, and a bill was to be given, accepted by the defendant, for the amount. The prices of the goods and materials had been agreed upon by the valuers, but not the quantities, respecting which they differed. The plsintiff under these facts, bad presented a bill for the amount he claimed for acceptance, and the defendant refused to accept it, contending that the contract was not completed and that there had been no valuation. Rule alis granted. (Sittings at Nisi Przus, at Westminster, before Mr. Justice I Wumis and a Common Jury.) This was the first day of the first sittings in Easter Term for Middlesex. The list contained an entry of 28 causes, of which one was a remanet. WVARNER V. WvIDDECOMBE Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Barstow aprered for the plaintiff and r. Bovill, Q.C., Mtr. Barnar, and Mr. E ames were counsel for the defendant. This was an action at the suit of the endorsee against the drawer of a bill of exchange for 500., which, according to the plaintiff's case, had been given in part payment for certain zinc and handed over to bn by a person named Leicester. The defence was that the bill of exchange declared upon had been intrusted to Messrs. Pace, Brothers, and Co. to be discounted, that they had given it to Leicester to negotiate, and that he had exceeded his authority and paid it over to the plaintiff on a transaction for the purchase of zinc, as above stated. In support of the case for the defendant he was himself called, and deposed that he wvas private secretary to a Mr. C. Merritt, the acceptor of the bill and contractor for the constraction of a railway in Scotland; that he was also a Parliamentary agent, but that he had this session no bills on hand; that he had been in the habit of drawing bils of ex-change for the acceptance of Merritt, and getting them discounted through Pace, Brothers, and that on some occasions they had taken goods for their bills, but that in the present stance no agreement had been entered into for the purchase of the zinc in queston, and that he had received nothing whatever for the bill, the subject of this action. Mr. Pace was also called, and gave a simai]ar version of the transsction. The examination and cross-examination of the witnesses both for the plaintiff and for the defendant were conducted with great minuteness, but a faUl reort of the case, which lasted nearly the whole of the day, would be most tedious and uninteresting to the general reader. After a careful summing up from the lsarned Judge the Zury retired, and the Court rose without their having delivered their verdict.
I COURT OF EX:CHEQUER. FRIDAY. ARir 18. I GLEGG V. THIE MDLAND RAILWAY COMPANY. (Sittinas ini Banco.1 This action was tried before Mr. Justice Cresswei at the last assizes for the county of Glocester, when the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff with 2001. damages. Mr. IEATING now moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside and entered for the defendants, or why there should not be a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. The plaintiff brought this action under the provisions of Lord Campbell's Act,-as administratrixof her husband, to recover compensation for his death, which occurred under the following circuinstances:-At the Cheltenham station on the Midland Railway there is a siding for-the passage of loaded trucks to the yard where the goods are to be deposited, and at the end of this siding there is a turntable, for the purpose of moving loaded tracks across the yard. Beyond this, and within two or three feet of it, there stands a goods shed used for the customers of the railway, among whom are the Messrs. Pickford. On the day in question the deceased, who was a clerk of Messrs. Pickford, was employed in his regular duties inside the shed, and it so happened that at the same moment a train was being shunted up the siding and two servants of the defendants were turuing a truck on the table. Fancying that they needed assistance, the deceased jumped out of the shed and exclaiming "Go on, lads; rnl give you a lift," placed himself between the buffer and the shed, when, unhappily, the train strack the track, and the chest of the deceased was jammed so violently between the buffer and the shed that he died shortly afterwards. The jury, after hearing the evidence, found a verdict for the plaintiff, and were anxious to give as damages 100l. more than was claimedin the declaration. The learned counsel to-day argued that there was no evidence whatever of any negligence on the part of the defendants, but that the unfortunate accident was entirely the result of the carelessness of the deceased. The COusT granted a rule to show cause. SSYnTH AND OTHERS V. SCHILZ. Mr. XNOwIEs moved for a rule to set aside the verdict for the plaintiffs in this action, which was tried before Mr. Baron Martin at the last Liverpool assizes, and for a new trial on the ground of misdirection. By- an agreement in writing, dated November 17, 1855, the defendant contracted to purchase of the plaintiffs 2,500 sacks of flour on certain specified terms,-viz., that they were to be put free on board a particular steamer, and that the steamer should sail from Idverpool on the 1st of December, for Santander, and thence for Constantinople. In case, however, any accident should happen to cause delay, and the vessel should not be " ready to sail" on the 4th of December, the buyer reserved the option of cancelling the contract. At the trial it appeared that at the time of the making of the contract the vessel was at sea, and did not arrive in Liverpool so as to be able to sail on the 1st; and at 6 oclock of the evening of the 4th, when, as was aDeged, everything was in readiness, the weather was so boisterous that the pilot refused to put to sea. The crew was at that time hired, but the " advance notes," which are usnally given to enable the sailors to draw a portion of their wages beforehand, were not issued until 5 o'clock on that day, in consequence of which they refused tojoin the ship. Supernumerarnes, however, were at hand, and it is not anuncommon practice atLiverpool, in case of the failure of any of thehiredsailors, for thevacant places to be supplied by them. Under this state of things the defendant elected to rescind the contract, and refused to buy the-flour, for which allegedbreach of theareement the jury gave damages 6,0001. The learned counsel now argued that the defendant was quite right in acting as he had done. The meaning of the agreement was that the ship must actually sail on the 4th of December; and even if the words "ready to sail" were to be taken literaly, yet the steamer could not be said to be read when she had no crew on board; besides which, if she had been ready, as she ought to have been, during the whole of the day, she would not have been delayed by stresa of weather. The COURT, however, was unanimously of opinion that it was suficiently shown that the steamer was ready to sail on the 4th, and that the plaintiffs therefore had wel performed theirpart of the contract. The rule therefore lor a new trial must be refused. (SiUzngs at ai PrIus, before Mr. Baron MAaTINv and Common .xJurics.) DOWSON V. FIRMT. This was an action brought to recover a sum of 671. for work and labour and materials supplieL The defendant paid 371. inlto court, and to the residue of the plaintiffs claim pleaded "Never indebted." Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Overend and Mr. goneyman were counsel for the defendant. According to the statement of the plaintiff's counsel, the plaintff was a general agent and contractor, carrying on b iness m London, and the defendant was a steel manufacturer at Sheffield. The defendant had ordered the laintiff to make him a case for exhibiting his goods at the rais Exhibition, which had altogether amounted to 971. ; but the defendant had since paid 301. on account. This action was brought to recover the balance. The following evidence was then adduced in support of this statement:- Joseph Dowson said,-I carry on business at 78, Welbeckstreet, odon, and also in Paris. Iam a general agent and contractor. I went to Paris in March last year. The Exhibition was opened on the 15th of May last. I went for several of the local committees of exhibitors of various towns in England. Mr. Firth is a large steel manufacturer in Sheffield. In the latter part of April he made an engagement with me to make him a case to exhibit his specimens. He had spaces allotted to him in the Exhibition, at first of 19 feet frontage, and then another frontage of 6 feet at the back of the former allotment. I made die case for him when he had the first space only, but it had to bq altered subsequently. The first interview I h'ad with Mr. Firth was in Paris, when heasked mewhetherI would tell him where he could procure materials for maldng the case, as he had his own carpenter over there, and he wished to make hinm work. I refused to give him the information. He then asked me if I would lend him one or two of. my. carpenters to assist him. I told him thaf as I had been to the expense of telegraphing for them to come over, and paying their expenses and wages, I could nof lend him my men, but, if he wished, I would make the case for him. Ie assented to that proposal. Labour was extremely difficult to obtain at that time. I paid my men 5s. per diem for expenses and 5s. d. a-day for wages. The case was ordered to be glazed, but no special instructions w6re given as to the kind of glass to be used. I put sheet glass mto the case, that being the least expensive. Mfr. Firtbh's foreman was named Fretwel1. I first sent in my acebsisteon the 26th of May. I received a remittance of 801. : upon that account, and, as the work was still going on, the defendant promised to pay the balance when the next account was sent in. The second and final account amounted to 92l 14s., with 30h. credit, the balance being 62?. L4s. The whole of the work charged for in that account was doneand the inaterials supplied. Materials were very dear in Paris at that time. 1only charged 10!. profit upon the prime cost. Cross-examined-.-I am a general agent and contractor. I have been so for about a year. I was an ironmonger before that in London. I-failed in '1851. 'From that time up toe thetime Iwent to ParisIlwas in:business, but not on my i ownac-count. Ihadenteredinto an agreement with the I Sheffield commissioners of the exhibitors to go to Paris - for | the purpose flooVafter their gcods as theyarrived. / That did not inclu-e r. Firth. I was to receive 31!. from the commi6sioners for receiving the goods as they arrived! and placmg them in the cases, I have been naid that sum. I beleve about 40 persons sent to the Paris lxhibition. from1 Sheffield, but I did not make cases for any of them with the& exception of Mr. Firth. Ail the others exhibited in the cases provided by the commnissioners of Sheffield. I made no arrangement with Messrs Firth before they came to Paris, although I had some communication with them 'before I left England. I don't recollect Mr. Firth coming to Paris and complaining that nothing was ready for him. He' did not complain that the case 'was not ready for him. I. am not a good French scholar, neither were the carpenters I tookover with me. Mfy men worked 32 days nine hours. The way I rade out my account was putting down the rime cost and then adding (the profit. I never told Mr. tretw that the reason I did not put in plate-glass was because I could not afford to buy it. My expenses were paid by the Sheffield co'mnittee. I have made claims against other exhibitors. I have had to bring several actions -perhaps 18 or 19. Several have been settled. There rro several still pending. Rle-examned.-tThose which have been settled have been paid in fulL When I got to E ngland no one would pay Several other witnesses were called in support of the plaintiff's case. The defence was that several persons in Sheffield agreed to send to the Paris Exhibition a quantity of goods for exhi: bition, and the plaintiff, hearing of this, had applied to the committee to take charge of the goods they sent. The defendant formed one of the committee, but had requested Dowson to make him a case by the end of April. That person had promised to do so, but on arriving m Paris on the 26th of April the defendant found that no case had been made. He thereupon told the plaintiff to supply him with materials and workmen, and he would have it made under the superintendence of his own man. This had been done' but the plaintiff had put in sheet, instead of plate-glass, as ordered, and had now sent in an exorbitant claim, which. of course, they refused to pay. Mr. John Firth said-I am a partner in the defendants' firm. We carry on business as manufacturers in Sheffield. Last year we exhibited at the Paris Exhibition. I wrote to the plaintiff about making me a case before the end of April. He agreed to do so. I went to Paris on the 26th of April,andfoundthatthe case had not been begun. I made acomplsint to Do;vson about it, and he said it was so difficult to obtain labour in Paris that he had been unable to make it. I gave the plaintiff instructions how to make it, and left my man to superintend the plaintiff's men. I ordered plate-glass to be put in; not sheet-glass. Iam sure of that, because I recollect a question being raised as to whether I should buy or hire the glass, as it was so expensive. Iremained in Paris seven days, and then returned to Sheffield. My man returned in Jume; and told me that sheet-glass had been put in the case instead of plate-glass, upon which I wrote a letter to the ulaintiff, requesting him to put in plate-glass, according to the order I had given him. Cross-examined.-I did not give the plaintiff any drawing of the case until I got to Paris. I took the carpenter. to put the goods in the case. I asked the plaintiff to lend me some of his men, but I don't recollect asking hun where I could get the materials from. I don't recollect his refusing to lend me his men. My memory as regards these circumstances is not very good, as I was iU at the time. Theplain-' tiff did not ask how he could get on with the case, as he had received no orders respecting it. There was a great deal of difficulty about getting mnen. It is not at all difficult to distinguish between sheet-glass and plateglass. My man was there all the time. I don't know the reason he did not object to the sheet-glass being put in instead of plate-glass. Several other witnesses having been called, Mr. HoNExv£AN summed up the defendants' evidence. Mr. HAwx;ncs replied. The learned JuDGE in summing up, said the question for thejury to decide was whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover 251. 4s. beyond the amount paid into court. If they were of opinion that 671. was a sufficient remuneration for the whole work done by the plaintiff, then they must find their verdict for the defendant I if not, then they would find for the plaintiff, with such an amount as they considered he was entitled to beyond the sun paid into court. The iuryreturned a verdict for the plaintiff for 20Z. 17s. rr. Baron Martin then went into the full Court of Exhequer, and the remaining causes were then tried (Before Alr. Baron BRABWEL.) ROBRRTS V. HUNT. IMr. Charnock appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Mills was counsel for the defendant. The plaintiff in this case was a young gentleman, an undergraduate of Queen's College, Cambridge, and the defendant was the proprietor of Hunts Yacting Magazine, published at 291, Strand. In 1854 the plaintiff and another young gentleman had accomplished the feat of what is called in sporting language" rowing across England"-namely,. from Cambridge to Uhester, a distance of 270 miles. This was done in a )Sager-boat weighing between 30lb. and 401b. It struck the plaintiff that an account of this undertaking would be just the thing for the .Yadcing Magazine, and he accordingly wrote to the defendant offering to supply one, at the same timne asking what remuneration he would receive for the contribution. The defendant, in his reply, stated that, as the eirculation of the magazine was rather limited, he should not be able to offer much. The plaintiff upon that sent in a portion of his account, 'which appeared in the May and other numbers, but he never completed it. He had also written an article, which had appeared, but he never could get any money for his productions. He had offered to settle the matter for 57, but this had been declined. He had then broughtthis action. The defence was that the contribution had been inserted upon the understanding that it was gratuitous. At all -events, the plaintiff had no rieht to bring his action in a .superior court. Mr. Baron BRMnn1ELL,, in summing up, said that the verdact of the jury must undoubtedly be in favour of the plaintiff. They must say what they considered a sufficient comp7ensation for the services he had performed. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with 7!. l0s. damnages The learned JUDGE refused his certificate that the cause was a proper one to be tried in a superior court.
I PREROGATIVE COURT. FRiDAY. APRTIL 1. VILDBORE ANVD BRIDGES V. BISHOP. (Before Sir J. DODSON.) This was a business of proving in solemn fonn of law the last will and testament, with a codicil thereto. of MUrs. Lydia Broadley Wilson, late of Clapham-commion, dated respectively the 16th of September, 1847, and the 30th of May, 1850. They were propounded by Mr. Wildbore and Mr. Bridges, the executors named therein, and were opposed by Mrs. Bishop, a cousin-german of the deceased, who appeared in faad pauperLs. The deceased died on the 13th of April, 1854, the widow of a gentleman who left a considerable stunmof money in legacies to friends and various charities, and then disposed of the residue infavour of his wife. Soon after his death, which took place in 1835, she made a will, and afterwards several others, but all of the same generalcomplexion as the one now propounded. Her only relatives were three cousins-german, once removed, with whom she did not appear to have been on friendly terms. Mrs. Bishop took no benefit under any of the wills. Probate was opposed on the ground that the deceased, when she executed the testamentary papers in ques'tion, was not of sound and disposing mind. The QuEE'S ADvoc.ATE (with whom was Dr. Twiss) appeared on the part of the executors, and contended that t'he evidence produced in support of the will and codicil was perfectly conclusive as to the capacity of the testatrix eubsequently to the execution of the latter. She afterwards became subject to delusions, and an attempt had been made to carr,y them back to a date anterior to the will, without any reasonable cause or pretext for so doing. MTs. Bishop never visited her, and when she proposed to call npon her the deceased declied to receive her. The opposition was entirely frivolous and vexatious, and if Mr. Bishop, the husband of the litigant party, had not been an uncertificated bankrupt, he (the Queen's Advocate) would have asked the Court to condemn him in costs. Dr. DODSos-, on the part of Mrs. Bishop, submitted that the deceased had laboured under various delusions from 1840 down to the time of her death, more especiaUy as to her husband. For years after his death she continued to insist that he was alive, and occasionally sent the servants to look for him. The case was brought within the decision in " Warng v. Waring," and therefore he prayed the Court to pronounce against the papers propounded. The COURT reserved its decision.
COUBT of BANKRUPTCY, BasinghaU-street, Aprig 1S. UT; RE WOODROFFE. (Beforc Mr. CommiRsioner FAwE.) The bankrupt was the landlord of the White Lion publichouse, Leather-lane. His accounts, extending over 13 months, show debts, 1,5721.; assets, 5751.; profits, 2741. ; expenses, upwards of l,0001. This was the certificate meet- gfr. Lucas opposed for the assignees; the bankrupt was also opposed for Mrs. Mar, a creditor, for having vexatiously defended an action. During the hearing of the case it was stated that the bankrupt had given 2,3001. for the lease of the White Lion, and which had since been sold for ,3001. The official assignee said that all property of this class had considerably depreciated in value of late. Having heard UMr. Lawrance for the bankrupt, Hiis HONOUR said the case presented every possible bad feature. There were no books at all, and the accounts showed expenses 1,0001. and profits only 2741. The bankrupt had put in a false plea to an action, and thereby thrown additional expense on the plaintiff. The time thus gained he liad employed in removing his goods to an nuctioneer's, by whom they were sold, and the proceeds went into the hands of one Tozer, who was souie connexion of thebankrnpt. The bankrupt hadA done all in his power to delay and defeat his creditors, and it was necessary to teach traders that this could not be done with impunity. The certificate (third class) would be suspended two years. and no protection would be granted unless the bankrnpt should have been six months m prison. hN RE CoYL£TS, SIMOlSD, AND CO. The bankrupts were merchants in Cullum-street. This ws the examination meeting inthe case of Cuylits. - Mr. Nicholson appeared for the assignees. The CoURT was informed that the bankrupt had committed suicide, by shooting himaself when in bed at an inn near Salisbury on the day that he was gazetted a bankrupt.. A memorandum to this effect was directed to be placed on the proceedings, and an adjournment ordered accordingly. In the absence of accounts it may be stated thatthe pret liminary statement of the affairs of the firm, by essrs.| Paul and Tmmer, shows debtsi 60,000b; assets, about 5,0001. There were certificate meetings in the case of J. Bond, shawl-warehouseman, of Ludgate-hill; J. Harrison, comiuion-agent ; and IL Crickmer, ship-owner, of East Donyland, Esse.r A certificate of the second class was granted in each case.

POLICE. MANSION-HOUsE.-Ferdinand Lenden, a foreigner, was brought before Alderman WIRrt upon a remarkable charge. Mr. John Lipscomb, clerk to Mr. Henry Pearson Males, of 5, Arthur-street, said,-On the 25th of March 1 received from thetraffic manager of a-railway with which the firm is connected a letter in the prisoner's handwiiting, requiring compensation for the loss of a carpet-bag, and two or three days afterwrardsI saw him, and he told me bad registered his carpet-ha4 in Paris, paying the customary fee of Is. I had then the ticket in my possession, and I show,ed it to him. He observed to me that he had had twobags, one of which he had registered, and the other he hadswung round him as a pouch ; and he also said that he had not seen the carpet-bag after he left Paris, but A companion of his voyage had told hi mthat his bagwas outside the custom-hou3se at Newhaven, and he had bettertake it. He mentioned that he told his friend, that his bag having been registered for London, he had no control over it till it reached London. I told him that every endeavour had been made to reoover his bag, and that we should'persevere inour efforts. He afterwards called two or three times, and on one occasion he produced an invoice which had been given back to him and which he stated -was a receipted invoice of articles he had purchased at Chester, and which he had been obliged to purchase in consequence of the loss of his carpet-bag and its contents. He asked me then to pay him tO/. on account of 191. lls., which he claimed as compensation for his lost bag and clothes. I told him I could make no arrangement of that kind. I returned to him his invoice, and told him I could make no arrangement of that kind. rOn the 29th of March he called again, and, as all efforts to-fnd the bag were unavailing, 1, believing that he had really lost his bag, offered- him as a compromise the sum of 10!., which he accepted, and for which he gave me a receipt. We have ascertained that he subsequently made a claim for the balance of his demand to the managers of the French railway, between which and the English railway there exists an arrangement. AKlderman WIBE.-Hlas the registered bag been found!s VVitnes3.-It has been found in the prisoner'spossession. I shall be able to prove that the bag produced bythe officer who apprehended the prisoner bears the counterpart of the ticket for the bag upon which the prisoner claimed the compensation. I was present last night at the prisoner's lodgings, at 40, King William-street, city, when the bag produced was found in the chamber occupied by huin There has been an attempt to obliterate the indicationon the ticket, but the identity has not been destroyed. Its contents, which consisted of clothing and docuiments, were examnined, and the bag was found to have the custom-house mark upon it. A metropolitan detective officer, who took the prisoner inrto custody, said that some of the clothes which the prisoner had got at Chester, and which had not been p)aid for, were found in the hag, and requested that time should be allowed to get together the witnesses. Alderman W1rit said that the officer should be snpplied w-ith all thenecessary facilities for completing a case of such -public imprtance, and remanded the prisoner, who by the advice of hs solicitor made no answer to or comment upon the charge, for a week. Gum aL,.-Henry Edwards, the lamdlord of the Blue Posts, 7, Holborn-bars, was placed at the bar, on remand, before Alderman CRTvER, charged with receiving a quantity of silk goods, well knowing the same to be stolen. Mr. Lewis said, he felt this case mnst go for trial, but the facts warranted the magistrate in taking baiL He urged the prisoner's respectablity, the openness with which he dealt with the goods, and the improbability of his guilty knowledge when be kept the reels in his possession with the owner's name upon them. Alderman CAR'Ern said, it was the prisoner's assumed respectability which made the matter more serious, and vas one reason why he would not admit him to baiL His position was calculated to throw off uspicion, and therefore frustrate the ends of justice. He should commit him for trial, but not admit him to bail. WESTrarsTx -A housemaid in the service of Mr. W. Haslett, of 3, Sussex-villas, King's-road, Chelsea, who gave her name on the police-sheet as Jane Hlamilton, but who represented herself while in that situation as Eliza Larman, was charged before M1r. PA-NTEB. with the following extensive and impudent robbery:- Mr. Haslett, who is a registrar of the Court of Bankruptey, said he charged the prisoner with stealing two 201. and two 101. Bank of England notes. She had been in his service for the last three months, and left the house suddenly, after the family had retired to rest, late on Sundav night. After breakfast on Monday morning prosecutor went to an iron box, kept in a wardrobe, and discoverd that 60., in notes, was missing. One of them for 201. bad been since traced to the prisoner. Mrs. Catherine Haslett, wife of the prosecutor, said that the money was safe at 19 o'clock on Saturday night, when she locked the iron box and wardrobe, and put the keys in her pocket. She left the key in the wardrobe on Sunday mornrag, and she supposed that another key which her son had of the iron box must have been left aboout and obtained possession of by the psisoner. William Charles Potter, 212 K, stated that he took the prisoner into custody at a house of ill-fame in Hunogerfordstreet, St. George's-in-the-Fsast, on Thursday night. He found her conceled between two beds, upon one of which she was lying. When he told her that he took her into custody for this robbery, she declared that she knew no one in London; that her name was not Eliza Larman, but that she was Mrs. Hamilton, a married lady just come from Scotland by the first-class train. He found some loose silver on the bed and in prisoner's pocket, also a gold chain, brooch, and new wredding-ring on her finger, besides a box full of new and handsome wearing appareL. He also discovered that the prisoner had left a new gold watch at the Reiners' Arms, in the neighbourhood of the house where he found her. The prisoner, who made no defence, was remanded until Thursday. It was stated that the accused had been formerly well known to the police of St. George's-in-the-East, and had been in a reforniatory institution, and that she was recommended to the prosecutor by his cook. WoxsnPr-sTlEET.-WIlliam Henry Barber was chargcd with robbery. Mrs. Matilda Wright, the wife of a warehouseman in the city, took a Stoke Newington omnibus at the Kingslandturnpike to convey her to town on Monday week, and, the vehicle being nearly full, found herself next to a stout maan, who sat near the door. This man got so close to her as to occasion an inconvenient pressure, and on reaching nearly the endof the Kingiland-roadhesuddenlygot out. Onfinding herself relieved fromi his annoyance she placed her hand into her pocket for her handkerchief, and, to her astonishment, fonnd her dress cut completely through close to the pocket, and that her portemonnaie had been robbed of its contents, consisting of sin sovereigns, vhile the purse itself was still open and empty in her pocket. The lady got out to pursue the thief, who was seen by the conductor to turn down Union-street, and then dart across into a place called Dean's-yard; but the man was too quick for her, and he escaped. The lady could not swear positively to the prisoner, not having once seen his face, but the conductor did so. He swore that he was a constant passenger by his omnibus, and was so on the day in question, when lie got in at Churclh-street, Stoke oewington, placed himself close to the door, and kept reading a newspaper the whole journey, up to the time he got out. The description given of the prisoner was so exact, that an officer named Moncey, who knew nothing of him, took him at once on the following Thursday in Shoreditch, and, though the prisoner stoutly denied it, he lodged him in the station, but found only 9s. V&d. on him. A lady named Abbott, the7wife of a builder in Bishopsgate, but residing at Kingsland, next proved that she got into an omnibus several weeks back to convey her to town, and found herself next to a gentlemanly-looking stout man, who was dressed in sober black, with a white neckerchief, and apparently a Dissenting minister.. The gentleman gradually encroached upon her,-and pressed upon he;, but sh-e thought nothing of it, as he was very intent upon readinag a new spaper the whole way-so intent, indeed, that she did not see his face, and he did not seem to notice that his newspaper several times partially covered her dress. The stranger shortly after got out, and she did so also in a few minutes, and upon then placing her hand in her pocket to make some purchase she found that her purse had been stolen, and with it seven sovereigns and a quantity of silver. -- Inspector Brennan, of the G division, said these robberies were of constant occurrence. He bad known the prisoner for years as getting his living by this system of robbery, and had seen him at various polce-courts charged with that offence, but he generally contrived to escape a conviction,. he (the inspector) having been PreSent on one occasion when he was tried and acquitted, aid, though not at that moment In a condition to prove it, he believed he had been once t}ansported. Inspector Brecknell also knew the prisoner as one of the most clever members of the swell mob, and, if time were given him, felt convinced he could prove him to be a returned transport likewise; and Z'I4ughlin, a warder ofthe House of Detention, to which the prisoner had been commnitted till yesterday, proved that upon searchiuw him, ilthough only 9s. could be found upon him before, he contrived to extract a sovereign from him in addition, though 'where the prisoner took it from he could not discover. The prisoner did not offer a word of defence or reftation. and ws committed tm that day week for the completionez the depositions.

THE ARTILLER.Y. TO THE; EDITOR OF THE TI3IES. Sir,-The leading artide in The Times of yesterday will, no deubt, attractattention to the infantryof the army;-what hope, I may be pernstted to ask-, is there of any notice being attracted to the artillery ? The importanco of that branch of the service is ecery day becoming more manifest; but tih public gener*lUy holds fast to the remnant of the Peninisila falacy, thtt British pluck and British bayonets reach further and damage more than British cannonbalLc. Such was our simuplicity when the recent war commenced, thn, we fanciedlaur artiUlery in the field more than a match for any other in the world. The exploits of a few gaUoping troops en1 Woolwich-coimnon had been an exciting theme of admiration during many years of peace; and in the dust that they threw up, the lowv state of the arm generally-its deficiency and inefficiency-was, until the war actually broke upon ns, lost sight of and forgotten. I was one of the first to call attention to the miserable results of the distribution of the corps, broken up as it was into petty detachments both at home and abroad. The pressure of the war has disturbed that system, but the dregs of it remain; and, without vigilance on the part of those who have the public interests at heart, it Inay again be resorted to. It assorts admirably -with incapacity. What can beso easyas to scatter an army all over the world, and then, when it is most wanting, and not forthcoming, to attack soeie defunct Mr. flume, or some living M1r. Cobden as the cause of failure? The use of artilery in masses is the war problem of the day; and if we don't speedily apply ourselves to its solution, I have no doubt, most likely to our unbounded astonishment, that it will some day or other be solved for us. In olden times (that is to say, about three years ago) we had a system quite the admiration of men in office, and who, strange to say, are in office stil, we had 12 guns assembled in Dublin, some 30 or so at Woolwich, and a few single troops and batteries in detached stations; and we had as faulty a distribution of the corps generaDly as could wel be imagined. WiU this system, or anything like it, be again resorted to? If it is to be well and good. I have no doubt those who carried it out so long and so contentedly are quite equal to the task of doing it again; but if a change is to be made, if something else whoUy different from the past is now de' sirable, I cannot help submitting that the capabilities which have reached the brink of extreme old age under the condemned state of things, are not exactly those which should be charged with raising the new structure. Will anyone caring only for the public interests examine carefuUy into the state of the departments comiected with the artiUery as to age, infirmity, incapacity, or antecedents, and say that a radical change is not necessary? In a corps, the promotion of which goes on by seniority, some rule should surely be laid down that the appointments connected with it-the sole prizes which an artillery officer has to look to-should not continue the lifelong affairs they seem now to be considered, The Ordnance has always been a snug portion of public patronage, and no department of the public service has been more rigidly ruled on the principles of an oligarchy alike injurious to the corps and to the publc senice. The fact that among so large a body of officers as those of the artilery so few names have reached the high grades of either a scientific or professional reputation, speaks volumes as to the absentce of encourage. ment or emulation in that arm. Where is the work to be found, or quoted as an authority in a professional subject, that has emanated from an officer of artillery ? Can it be that a body of English gentlemen, selected and educated as they are, are deficient in talent or ability; or is it not that they serve under a system in which talent or ability are of no avail? In every part of our service we must, it would seem, have a leaven of the upper 10,000. In the Artilery, having no aristocracy of birth we make one of place. The Horse Artilery and our placeholders comprise our upper strata, and the patronage which should encourage zeal and promote merit goes round in the narrowest circle. An appointment at Woolwich is made a kind of life peerage. I do not wish to deal in declamation; al I desire is, that some strong minded, clear-headed Secretary for WVar, may some day or other be provoked to closet himself with some one acquainted with the Artillery, and unconnected with " the clique." He would learn, or I am much mistaken, many things of which he is now ignorant. He would find, as I have said, how completey the good things of the service are in the hand5 of a few,-how individuals have stepped from one appointment to another for so long a period that many of of them have not seen a day's service out of England, or done a day's regimental duty for extremely long periods. Some of themii, the highest in office, have never had commands of greater importance than a troop, a battery, or an attenuated district in England. Whether these matters are worth looking into or not, I trust that such a distribution of the corps willbe made as w gill ive officers tothe service whose nerves will not shrink from the command of masses of the arm, or even of mixed bodies of troops. Our material is the finest in the world; all we require is to be wrenched from the tenacious grasp of the old, the infirm, and the prejudiced. Is it fair or likely to give encouragement to the mass of the regiment, to find that, out of four field officers of Horse Artillery at Woolwich at this moment, three hold other appointments; or, that those who advocated the part under which we have suffered so much should, with their infirm hands, in doubtful sincerity be allowed to build up for the future? A SOLDIER. April 1S.
THE DEFECTrVE MORTARS OF GRISSE A-ND Co. -A long and somewhat tedious correspondence with reference to a contract of Messrs. Grissell and Co. for mortars, presented to Parliament by the Royal command, was publshed yesterday. The subject has already been discussed in our columns. It may suffice to state, for the present, that (according to a paper before us) two mortars, 13-inch sea-service, 5 tons, made by Grissell and Co., were tried by firing the ordinary service dharge, at Shoeburypoint, Essex, after they had been subjected to the usual proof-fire at Woolwich. At the 10th round one of these mortars burst in a vertical direction through the centre of the bore, and it was then discovered that a plug had been screwed into the rear of the breech about 2 inches long and 1A inch in diameter, seriously weakening the mortar in thatfdirection and thus rendenng it more liable to burst. This led to an examination of the rest of the mortars at that particular point. There were found three other mortars that had been plugged in a similar manner, one of which had alreay 'en rejected on account of having plugs inserted in the face to fill up flaws in the metal. Another of the mortars supplied by Grissell and Co., burst on the usual proof, such being an extraordinary instance of inferior metal. The officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Mitchel, R.A., under whose orders the defective mortars were fired at Shoebury, reports that " the screw had evidently been inserted with great care, and could not be detected unless specialv sought for." Such is the substance of LieutenantColonel Eardley Wilmot's official report to Mr. Monsell, h.P. Hereupon follows a long explanatory letter, vwritten to Lord Panmure by the inculpated firm, into the details of which itis of course out of ourpower to enter. Messrs.Grissell conclude by saying-" the gist of the matter is, have we intendedfraud? on thisissue we fearlessly claim from your lordship and our feUow-countrymen an unqualified acquittal." Whatever the intentions of the Messrs. GrisseU may have been. their explanation does not appear to have satisfied the Government. Their letter was referred to LieutenantColonel Eardley Wilmot. That officer is inclined to doubt that the iron (partly) used by Grissell arid Co. (the Staffordshire iron of Grazebrook and Co.) is " the highest on the list of strong irons ;" it is at least certain, as he observes, that the peculiar mixture of iron used for the mortars " has utterly failed." Colonel W9ilmot reports, with reference to the plugging of the mortars, that Mr. Grissell explained it to be an ordinary custom in large castings, stating that "it had been done by his foreman without his knowlEedge. itbeing a common culstom-that the mortar was not a bit the worse for it, &§c." MIr. Grissel's urgent appeals to the colonel to induce him to receie the mortar (No. 4) were met with a stern refusal, and Mr. Grisse)l is indirectly censured for not having then pointed out that three other mortars were plugged. In answer to Mr. Grisselrs assertion that there was " no fraud or disguise," certain suspicions circumstances are adduced by Colonel Wilmot which would seem to indic-te a desire for concealing the insertion of the plugs and a determination to escape detection. In short it appears to the colonel that "the statement of Grissell and Co. as to the plugs in the face of the mortar is not consistent with the facts displayedon the plugsbeing extracted. All the plugs are 2A inches long, and there are at least tvo flaws of about 4 inches deep. 'The plugs are of cast iron, which is very unusual. The mortar was delivered painted, and on the discoverv and rejection of this mortar, no evidence appears of a desire to point out and e.xPlain the cause of the plugs in the breech." Mfessrs. Grissell made another strong appeal to Lord 1'aumure on the 9th inst., in which, after entering into all the details of the case and adverting to the severe remarkg recently made on the subject in Parliament, they entreat his lordship to remember that " their characters as mnen and as tradesmen are at stake," and that early and public reparation is due to them. 'This letter was referred to Colonel Wilmot for his opinion, amtd on Monday last (April 14) Lord Paniure wrote to Miesrs. Grissell to this effect-viz., that, after having carefully considered the charge ngainstthe firm andthe evidence on v#aich it rested, it appeared to his lordship that Mr. Gris;d'J's statement to CoYonel Wilmot of his previous ignorance-of the existence of the plugs was not correct; that MWr. Gri,sell acted most improperly in not stating to Colonel Wiknot the existence of eertain centre-holes, and that, with reforence to the holes in the face 6f the mortar, "a deception waYs practised for which Mr. Grissell is responsible, w btbsr 2v was practised with or without his knowledge." Loxd Panmure further adduces the bursting of all the three mortars of Griseell and Co. tried with the ordinary service charge, as an incontrovertible proof that the materials whereof those mortars were made were not of sach quality as to insure their fitness for service. Lord Panmuze concurs in the opinion of Colonel Wilhot and Captain Caffn, that the boring of the holes in the centre of the breech was injurious to the strength of the mortar; but he adinits that the plugs inserted (with the exception of those in the fawe), were not placed there for the purpose of concealing flaw3; aid bore the matter lests,
THE ASSASSINATION IX4 BUPERT-STREEZ. The unfortunate man Rouelli still lives, and, contrary to the opinion of all the medical officers of the hospital. who .aw him shortly after his admission, there now appears to be some hope that his life may be saved. Mr. Beck, the bouse surgeon, sat up with the unhappy man during the whole of Thursday night, and, under his carefiul management, Rouelli became more composed when the first shock of the attack had passed off. Up to this time the patient has taken nothing but gentle stimulating drinks, but the most promising feature in the case is that the abdominal inflammation has not increased. Some 24 hours longer will be necessary before it can be pronounced that the viscera are uninjured, and if this should prove to be so the case will be one of the most extraordinary on record. when the severity of the external wounds over the whol: Furface of this portion of the body is considered. It ha; been stated that Rouelli is a man of some education, and very superior to the station he has lately been filling in Rupert-street. it is a fact that he was brought up as a cadet in the Imperial College at Milan, and that, for some time, he was employed in one of the municipal offices a; Genoa. He is stated to have been a man of very quiet habits and a general favourite among his associates. The assassin Foschini is still at large. As early as possible after the deposition of Rouelli had been taken on Thursday night, Inspector Parke, of the C division, with a coinstableproceeded to the lodgings lately occupied by the accused at the house of an Italian named Risoldi, residing at No. 40, Leather-lane, lolborn. It is scarcely necessary to say that nothing had been heard of him here, and up to the presen'. moment he has eluded the vigilance of the officers. Although only a yomug man, Foschini seems already to have earned for himself a terrible notoriety. Three years ago he was compelled to leave his native city, Lugo, in the Papal States, on account of his violent conduct on more than one occasion. While in Italy, he was engaged in a manufactory carried on by his cousin at Aviano; and, on arriving in England, he was first employed in some iron works at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which place he left after having made a violent attack on an Italian fellow-workman. Since his arrival in London he has been employed at Messrs. Bernaux's envelope manufactory in Lambeth, and here he was engaged up to Thursday last. The officers have obtained a clue to his retreat, and it is not thought that he can long elude their vigilance. The other sufferers are going on well.
CIVIL SERVICE SUPEBANNUATION. - w- This committee met yesterday in Room No. 12; the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the chair. Sir J. Graham was examined, and said he introduced the measures respecting superannuation during Earl Grey's Government. The intention of the framers of that act would best be gathered from the terms of the act itself and the Treasury minute of 1829, on wlhich that enactment was founded. He had a distinct recollection thatprevious to the passing of the act a fund had existed for superannuation in the Excise and Customs, and which was so appropriated, but by an arrangement with the Treasury that fund was annulled. After detailing the arrangement of salaries in the different departments of the civil service to the passing of the Reform Act, Sir James said the scale was altered in 1829, but all who entered the service subsequent to that period did so wvith the full knowledge that a deduction would be made from their salaries for a superannuation fund. The ap plicationof the income-taxto salaries of 1001. had caused grea dissatisfaction, and it was not until this new burden wt thrown upon them that the civil servants had complained o the superannuation deduction. He should be sorry to see the State making a provision for the wives and children o deceased members of the civil service, as it would be carry ing superannuation a step beyond what was contemplated and the deadweight would become so heavy that thI system would break down entirely. No falling off hal beenexperiencedin the application of persons tobeem ployed in the civil service; but, on the contrary, there wa; a continued pressure on the heads of departments The work of the civil servants had not fallen ofW and from his experience in the Admiralty during the war he could bear testinony to the zeal and alacrity witlh which those servants had performed their duties His own opion was in favour of superanuation, fo by it the Goverment exercised a control of the ser vants, and at the same time offered a premium for good conduct, and he should be sorry to see the system altered. The civil servants had always wanted an increase of salary for lengthened service and also an increase of superannuation when theyretired, and he did not blame them for attempting to obtain all they could. Sir Francis Baring said he was not a member of the Government at the time the Treasury minute was formed, but had a good deal to do with the areparation of the Superannuation Act, as he was theni Secretary to the Treasury. He believed by that act there was no intention on the p.art of the Government to erect a fund out of the deduction from the salaries of civil servants who entered since 1829. There was no such intention on the part of himself or Sir Alex;ander Spearman. As the civil servants were made aware of this deduction when they entered, in strict justice they had no right to complain, the superannuation being a great advantage to them. He had never heard of any offers from any insurance office to take the fund off the hands of the tovernment and make a provision for the servants, nor did he think such an offer would be made. Mr. Lumley, Assistant Secretary to the PoorLaw Board, said the clerks in his department were most anxious to be placed under the superannuation allowance, and, if necessary, would submit to a deduction fromu their salaries to effect that object ; but, of course, were desirous of obtaining the advantage without the deduction. Mir. HIobson, Customs' locker, gave evidence to show the hardship of the deduction of 24 per cent, from salaries of i001., and said he thought thle Governmuent should provide a superannuation allowance for their aervanta without any deduction. Mr. Edwards, acting-secretary to the Legal and General Life Assurance Company, stated that the deduction of 5 per cent, from the salaries of civil servants was more than sufficient to provide a superannuation fund. The committee then adjourned.

DIscovERY oF Rowxs R,.Nr2ns.-A discovery -was made on Monday last on the farm of AbbeyEfats, which forms part of the glebe lands in the incumbency of the Rev. Mxr. intour, rector of Barton-upon-Trent. Barton has long been known to afford indications of Roman remains. In particular the onestead of the fari of Abbey Flats has been quite celebrated for possessing a fold-yard paved with the small diced tiles of the conquerors of the world. Passages of these tiles are distinctly visible in the fold-yard, and it is in the field immediately adjoining it to the east that the present discoveries have been baid hare. For a long time Mr. Wintour has noticed that se,uare patehes situate at intervals over the surface of t 'is field have either failed to produce crops, notwithstanding the fertility of the red clay of which the field is composed, or have presented squares of scanty and stunted produce, in great contrast to the rest of the field. The cause has now been disclosed. On MVonday last, as the parish clerk was ploughing in this field, the plough struck against the edge of what proves to be a tesselated pavement not a foot beneath the sulface. The clerk stopped the plough and communicated with the reverend gentleman, who, having set sonie labourers to work, gently cleared the surface, and, at the depth of a foot, laid bare about one-fourth, diagonally, of a superb pavement of bold and elegant geometrical designs, in red, white, and blue, as fresh and beautiful as the day when it was first laid down. From the appearances and the traces of passages or walks leadingthrough the field, Mr. IW'intouris convinced that the Abbey Flats must have beeis the site, not merel of a singleDRoman villa, but of numerot s houses. Ieanwjite he has had the flooring just discoveeed washed clean so far as it is traceable; and we were enabled distinctly to follow the whole variations of the pattern. The space thrown open forms an oblong rectangle, measuring 1-5 feet by 10 feet, extendinglengthwisedueeast andwest. Thisrectangleis occu- pied by an outer border of small red half-inch tiles, three feet uroad on the west and one and ahalf on the south. This is succeededbyaninner borderofblue, nineinches broad * and then by delicate double lines of small white tiles, including a magnificent scroll border six inches broad, of interlacing red, white, and blue tiles, succeeded by anotlier delicate double white line. The centre part withhi this brilliant bordering (separated from it by a double line of blue) is occupied with a great variety of geometrical figures. In alt these the colouring of the tile is renarkably brilliant. Th s flooring appears to be laid down on a cement, which, however, reposes upon artificial soil of very great depth, presenting the colour of a dark fertile mould very unlike tlin red clay of the field in general. MIr. Wintour, in causin the soil to be dug up around the site of these discoveries has met invariably intermixed with the soil smal pieces o: chared wood, as if the edifices here situated had beeni com pletely destroyed by fire. Large stones and traces of wal' ifoundations are, however, discovered abundantly in the Ifidld.-Nlottinq,na)b Guardianm. Cuxious PrscovxaY.-On Thursday last, as the sexton of Worksop Church was digging a grave near to the porch, he found, aoout two feet from the surface, a human skull, having an arrow-head, very much corroded, 22- inches in length, inserted therein on the right side. It appears t) I have penetrated the skull full two inches, the socket of the arrow, about three-quarters of an inch long, alone protruding from the exterior. On exposure to the air a great portionof this fragment of mortality dissolved and mingle I with its kdndred clay; still, however, sufficient remains to render it an object of interest to the curious and contemplative mind. How long this seat of thought-this human crown of one of our forefathers, has been removed fromn time'smauightv conflicts, and from what cause it was laid low, cannot be gscertamned: it is probable centuries have. elapsed since that period. The dkutl may be seen OB ap$li. §ation to the sexton.---Donc¢ta6( C;/iron ice.

THE CORN TRADE. CORN-EXCHANGE, 11s)AZT Amrm I& The arrivals of grain. although not large, show a tendency to increase, aud the consequenoe is a heav-y state of business generally. Wheatis not supporEed, and other descriptions have only a slow sale at previous price& The arrivals from Ireland and coas ase, snoe Tuesday, have been liberal of oats and oatmeal, but otherwise insignificant. Owing to contrary winds during the past two or three days we have only received from foriga ports 643 quarters of wheat and 1,201 sacks of flour, besides 687 quarters of wheat from Canada. The exports in the same tine comprise 630 equartera of wheat, 6,006 quarters o£ indian corn, 812 Sacks and 1,255 barrels of flour. There has been little or nothing doing in the trade since Tuesday. and prices generally remain as before. The weather has been cold and unseasonable of late. At this day's mnarket there was the usual attendance of the toenv and country trade. Wheat and flour met with a moderate retail sale, at about Tuesday's rates. 1Prne oats and oatmeal were in rather better demand. but without alteraton in value, vhile inferior samples were the tur lower. Egyptian beans found buyers im quantity at 6d. per quarter more money, but barley aud peas remained as Last quoted. There was only a limited show of Indian corn, and, holders showing .considerable finuness, needy buyershad to pay 6d. per quarterover the rates current on Tuesday, prime yellow bringing 29s.; mixed, 28s. 6d.; and white, from 25s. for southern to 29s. d. per quarter for prime northern.
