That the invention had been #ubmitted to competition with other processes, clariiutig to have similar virtues, upon the New Pdlace at .West"ninster.annd wsaAthe only one that had succeeded.I The etition. went on. to Dray, the petitioner having xeen inforrned that certain decaying and deleteriouns influences iatd already been at work on portions of the New Palace at Westminster, that. the House would inquire into the truth of these allegations; and, if satisfied with the jesults of such 'inquiry, that it would accept the use of such patented invention for national purposes. He had himseL seen areport from Sir C. Bar whuch stated that the result of the invention, winch bad been tese upO 1,400 square yards of the house, had been entirely atis factory. Under these circumstances, he begge t ask Hex Maiesty's Government whether they were prepared tc ippoint a committee to inquire into tbe matter r rThe lErl of HARRLNGTON thought that it was too late in the session to appoint a committee. Iord LY DRIURST said that portions of the stone'work were already beginning to decav, and nio time ought to be lost in taking some step to prevent the continuance of that decay. THE PATENT LAW. - lord LYNDHURST wished to ask his noble friend upon the woolsack if it was his intention to introduce any measure during the next session to amend the law relating to patents. The LORD CHACELLOR said that the subject was so beset with difficulties that be could not make any pledge mpon the subject, but it would receive his most careful consideration. PAROCHIIAL SCHOOLS (SCOTLAND). The Duke of BUCCLEUCH, in presenti-g a petition from Aberdeen against the Parochial Schoole Bill, begged to ask Her Majesty's Government if it was their intention to do anything with respect to the position of the schoolmaster-s. - The Duke of AIIGYLL was understood to say that the period of the session would prevent any step being taken at present. Lord MONTEAGLE presented a-petition from an association in the city of Calcutta, composed of natives of India. praying for the enlargement of the Legislative Council. The noble lord also presented another petition from indigo planters of Calcutta, complaining of the maladministration of justice in India, and of the state of the law and police courts in the lower provinces of BengaL The petitioners sta1ted that property and person were most inadequately protected, that a reorganization of the police was necessary to make it effective for its purpose, and that thepolice wvas universally reproached with corrupt practices. They also desired a reform of the laws of the country. The prayer of the petitioners was that their lordshipswould take the petition into consideration, and institute an inquiry into the evils of which they complained. INDIA. The Mtarquis of CLANRICAIDE, in moving for various xeturns relating to estates ass>essed to the land-tax in Bengal, Babar, Orissa, andBenares, tothesalaries and dautiesof officers of the 1ndian army, and of officers and persons belonging to the covenanted and uncovenaused civil service, to the law =xpenditure of the East India Company, and to the allovrance to the deposed Eajah of Coorg, stated that his object was not to elicit any opinion on these subjects, but to prepare for the inquiry which must take place in the course of next session. A letter had appeared in The Timnes, signed by Mfr. Stephenson, on the subject of public works, alluding to the iinpediments which existed to the investni,uit of British capital in India-impedimuents arising not only from the complicated form of government, but also from the present state of the law. It was almost impossible to get at the truth upon any subject connected with India, and it was onlv natural that men who had achieved distinction and wealth under a certain system should defend that system and endeavour to prevent any exposure of its faalts. The object of the frst return for wbich he mnoved was to ascertain how many estates in those territories had been confiscated since l82S, and be hoped he should not be told that their number was so great that the information he desired could not be laid before the House. With regard to the civil service, he understood the Governor-General had been obliged, in conse quence of the paucitv of civil servants, to caUl npon officers of theI ndian army to perform civil and political duties, This was a fact which concerned the efficiency of the army as well as the civil service, and another question also aroseviz., whether officers of Her Majesty'sarmy were not entitled to perform those duties as well as officers of the Indian arny. The result of the present system was, that judicial functions were given to m en who did net know the language of the personswhem they had to try, and that a boy from asleyhury, v;ho wvas entered as an assistant, really found himself with authority to administer judicialfunctions. AU he asked wras that the House shouldknow how many of these officers there were. He wished also to know the number of versons in the uncovenanted service. le trusted that the pu61ic opinion of the country would force Parlia=nent to undertake the duty from which he hoped it would not be disposed of itself to shrink. He should like also to have a return of titc expenditure of the Court of Directors in lavwsuits in England, which he believed would prove to be something monstrous. fle believed the number of appeals would not be so great if the courts of India were tolerably well constitated, or if a spirit of litigation or oppression were not excited which induiced the civliservants of the Company to commence proceedings and involve the Indian Government in lawsuits that many of the natives were unable to resist. In many of these cases the East India Company were signally and, he might say, disgracefully discomfited. The returns were then ordered. RA.IAH OF COORG. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE then rose to move that the return of the law expenditure in England of the East India Company since the year 1g55, ordered to be laid before this House on the 16th of June, be made forthwith; and also, to move for copies of any minute of the East Indian Government in 1l834, specifying the tesrus and conditions o1 the allowance to be made to the deposed Rajah of Coorg. He hoped that the Government would allow this prince tc reside in this country unless some better reason were given against it than had yet been urged. Some ODjec. tion had been made that it was not desirable that Indian money shonld be spent in this country, but the sum allowed to the Rajah (4451.) was less than the -directors were in the habit of spending upon themselves for a'public dinner. The Rajah of Coorg wasa prince to whom the East India Company had formerly been under great obligations, and he could scarcely resist the conclusion that they wanted him to be forced out of the country in order that he might be prevented from attending to the lawsuit in Chancery which he had instituted to enforce his rights. So far from its being inconvenient, he thought it highly desirable -that the princes of India should be encouraged to vist this counmtry. The Duke of ARGYLL said, he had explained the other night that the Government did not feel called upon to defend the cou-se taken by the Est India Company in this matterPersonally, -he rather agreed with the noble marquis, that there wouldi'e little barm in allowing this old prince to remain in London; but he believed the prince was in such a position that he required leave of absence from the Company; that-he ha(l applied for leave to remain a year in England and that he had, at the expirati)n of that period, received intimation of the desire of the Company thathe should return to India. The Earl-of EIsLENBOROUGI suggested that the noble marquLis should-ma.ke the termg of his motion so general that the East-India; Company could not avoid maldng the returns. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE assented, and the mnotion, as amended, was agreed-to. TH3E :1YCE SOMB1RE CASE. EarxlSt. VNCENMT, who had a notice on the paper to call theirlordships' attention to several passages in judgments delivered by varieus courts during the protracted htigatoan upon the alleged sanity of Mfr. Dyce Sormbre, called upon the clerk at the table to read the passages indicated. lr. Edmunds read the following from the judgment of the Judicial Committee -ef Privy Council on the 1st -of July, iffl:- Beforeprosecuting thisdiaquiry it mazy etroper to observe that .

Lord Conbermere's letter is to thiseffect: 'Youshouldcometo Dieppe, and there, waitWill yoi get the. ierinssion tooome over to Brighton to be' exarined by DrM. Brght d Southey.' So that he was preparing him for this very ex, qminatlon at Brighton. ' If- your .answer their questions cdolly anid in a few words, they must declare yotl to be in such a-state as to render you, q ute fit to have -yoir Eibejty and property, which, I think; have been so uniustly with. held from you. I hope wheu youL are examined, tha. t will eay as little as you possibly can about Mrs. D. S. You should, I think, say that, whatever delusion you laboured undersorme time ago, it has left you.' It is advice not only hbonutwhat he is toconcealbut what he is to say. He is to be prepared for these examinations. He is to be crammed for them, as it is sometimes expressed . ' You should- I th;in, say that whatever delusion you laboured'under'soine time ago, it hass left you, as you became divested of your Eastern notions and feelings about women; and fur-ther, that there is no longei any danger of yonr being jealous .of her' (not that you'are convinced thatyou have oeen under error and under delusion) 'inasmuch as you have lost all love, admiration, and affection for her, and that no power upon earth should induce yeu to live with or go near her again. Yoa should say also, that it is your wish to go to India for the benefit of your health, and in order toloolc into arnd arrange your affairs. Let me know on what day you willoeat Dieppe. I will go down to Brighton when I ~ae;r that yon are to be there.' So thnatho is to go dolwn and assist him upon this occasion. Now it so happens, Isuppose, that he didnot render him that' assistance, that he was not there upon that occasion, because Mr. Dyce Sombre hiniself, when he is speaking of this examination, mentioning itin his book, says :-'But what could I do when left by myself?. I had nobody to support me, so that I was obliged to say wh'at they would have me say.' So that he did not con: ceai the delusion thoronghly and effectually upon that soccaion, and the consequence was, that Dr. Bright and Dr. Southey reported in the manner wvhich I have aleady stated." . . . "When I see how this poor man was prepared for the purpose of undergoing his examinations -how he was urged by various persons to conceal his thoughts-not to give up his delusions, not to conceal them, and to pretend that he had none remaining, in order that he might pass his examination, might get his supcrsedcas, and might recover the whole of his property-when I see what. has taken place with regard to 31r. 2lahon, and with respect, to Mr. Prinsep, though, undoubtedly, the letters which wsere written by him were not precisely of the same tenor, and I thinlk not so blameable as those which were written by Lord Combermere and Lady Combermere urging the concealme-nt of the delusion-I say, that I think, under all the circumstances of the case, I am bound to pronounce against the wi3l with eosts." The next extract was from a judgment of Lord Chancellor Cottenham, delivered on the 20th of,3April, 1S49:- . Not long after this I received two communications, of a character unexampled, I hope, in the history of this court. The first was dated the 24th of December, 1848, tvo days after the former petition had been dismissed, signed by Drs. Paris, Mayo, Morison, Copeland, arid Costello. The other was dated the 18th of January, 1849, signed by Lords Combermere, Downshire, Shrewsbury, and four other gentlemen, to which was added a note from Sir Charles Trevelyan, of the Treasury. This latter document ,ppeared to be intended principally to introduce the former. The whole of this proceeding was most irregular and impro. per, as every Privato communication addressed to ajudge for the purpose of influencing his decision upon matters before him always is, and ever ought to be reprobated. Itis a practice calculated to divert the course of justice, and ought to be more frequently treated than it is as a high contempt of court. It is too often excused on account of the station and condition in life of the parties guilty of it, who are supposed to be ignorant of what is due to the court. No such excuse can be made in this case. If this was not intended as a private communication, why was it made in that form 1 Why was it not brought before the Court in the usual manner, through the solicitor and counsel of the lunatic, who alone could be recognized as his representatives ? I have received from two of the subscribers to that letter, Lords Comberimere and Shrews. bury, an assurance that nothing disrespectful to myself was intended by that communication. I never considered it in that light; but, as judgeofthecourt against which this contempt has been committed, I am hound to express my bigh reprobation of the course pursued, not on y on account of the letter itself, but also on account of the rank and station of the parties implicated. I cannot, however. doubt, from the explanation given to me by Lord Shrewabury of the manner in which the letter was submitted to him and his signature obtained, that he was not aware at the time of the nature of the transaction, or of the purpose for which it was intended to be used. This is no more than I should have expected, and Iam ready to believe, from thehigh character deservedlyborne by that noble lord, and the high principle with which, from personal knowledge, I am aware he is actuated, that he is incapable of it know.ingly. Raving said so mucl upon the subject of this high contempt of the court, I have now to see how it should influence my conduct in reference to the petition since presented-the fifth petition. I do not find any staterent as to the time at which Mr. Dyce Sombre left this country after the examination in November, 1848: but as, by my order, his protection was to continue until the report of the physicians was made, and as that report was dated the 18th of November, 1818, I must assume that he left this country aoon after that tine, and I cannot, therefore, suppose him to have been here after the 22d of December, when my order dismissing the formerpetition was made. This is of some importance in the consideration of how far I am to consider the petition presented on the 29th of January as the act of Mr. Dyce Sombre, whose former petition for the same purpose was, by his own concurrence, expressed through his counsel, dismissed upon the 22d of December. Upon this sauhiect most important evidence is contained in a letter from Mr. Dyce Sombre to myself, dated Paris, January 12, 1849, containing several inclosures, one of which, No. 3, is a letter purporting to be signed by Anthony3fahon,called in other places Dr. Mahon, and addressed to Colonel Dyce Sombre, reciting an agreement under which Dyce Sombre, then a lunatic under the protection of the Court, agrees to pay Dr. Mahon 10,fOOl. in case the commission of lunacy should be superseded through his instrumentality and e-xertions." Earl St. VINCENT then put the following quLsstions a " Whether, inasmuch as the judgments of the highest legal tribunals are matters of public record, an d may be referred to as facts in the knowledge of Government, and considering the severe censures that have been passed in three successive judgments, pronounced by the late Lord Chancellor Cottenham, by Sir John Dodson, judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and by the Judicial Committee of Privy Co1ncil, apon the conduct of a noble member of this house holding the situation of Constable of the Tower of London, and also a distinguished office near Her Mfajesty's person, Her Majesty's Government have thought proper, for the due preservation of the high character of this House, to take any steps in reference thereto, or if they intend so to do 'el The Marquis of LANSDOWNE maid, the Government were not prepared to take any steps upon this subject, neither were they inclined to enter upon the consideration of circumstances which had occurred in civil suits, relating to a nobie lord who was not a party to those suits, and who had had no opportunity of being heard in his ow,n vindication. (Rear, hear.) At the same time, while the Government did not perceive the propriety of insituting any proceedings, they did not intend to pronounce any opinion upon the matteis stated in the judgments to which the noble earl had referred. He could fully understand the feelings which had induced the noble earl to bring forvard this matter, connected as it was with his nearest relative- an estimable distinguished lady; but any discussion in that house would ;lead to no good result, and, therefore, he trusted the noble earl would not press the After a few words in reply from Earl St. VircExT, which were completely inaudible in the gallery, the matter *as allo-wed to drop. LEASES AND SALES OF SETTLED ESTATES BILL. On the motion that the Cemmons amendments beconsidlered, Lord REDESDALE opposed 'the amendment of the Commons which deprived Sir Thomas Wilson, the Lord of the Manor of Hamp stead, of the ordinary power which the art conferred on other tenants for life. 'The Earl of WICKLOW was alto of opinion that great injustice had been done to Sir Thomas Wilson by the mode of '--gslation adoptedbythe Houseo C,oimmons. He hoped that the samae rights would be conferred on Sir Thomas Wilson as were to be conferred on otherrindiriduals. and thoat as soonz as he obtained those rights the Government or the muniipality of London would make themselves msnetor of a spot which was beyond all price to the inhabitants of the metropolis. The liOReD CHANCELLOR certainly thought that 'Sir aThomas Wilson had had hard justice death to him hitherto.. The case, however, was this :-Sir Thomas had applied to Pzrliame&b in order to get ar. act enabling him to do that which by lass lhe was restrained from doin. T'he question 2,X'4 the coastenction of the will was referred to the judges, wbo reported not only that under it he had not the power -f granting building leases, but that, ,accoring to the true consttuction of the wil . i; vwas the inaention of the testator that he should -not L buld.

ABERDEEN; TOTOVERSITIES. In reply to a question from Mr. G. THOursoK-, The LORD-ADVOCATE said thai a commission was about to be issued to inquire iuto the whole subject of the union of the universities of King's College and Marischal College, Aberdeen. Unless all parties were substantially agreed, the Government would not consider it a matter in which they ought to interfere. PENSIONS. lb. BOVTYER, asked the hon. gentleman the Secretary of the Treasury by what act of Parliament, or other authority, or upon what ground, two pensions to Caroline Cort and Catherine Liddon, for 251. each per annum, had iheet- reduced to 19!. each per annum, being 25 per cent., . or 31S.. sterling, during the last 2õ ????? ? Mr. WILSON replied that these pensions were originally granted at 25.. 6s. per ?????, hut they were subject to chaiges amounting to 6Î. 6s. In the 2d and 3d year of the reign of William IV. it was enacted that in future pensions should be paid net, and when these pensions were renewed, at the commencement of the reigns of William IV. and of Her present Majesty, they were granted .at the net sum of 19¿. Mr. ROEBUCK asked whether the original sums had been debited against the cisril list since these pensions were reduced. Mr. WILSON could not answer that question. Mr. BOWYER asked the righthon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he did. not consider that when the Legislature presided that small pensions were to ?? paid without deductions it intended this to be for the benefit of the poor pensioner-, and not to lead to a saving of the public funds? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said that the hon. gentleman was as capable of forming an opinion o£ the intention of the Legislature as he was. All the Government had to look to was the warrant by which the pim-aoiis were granted. Mr. ROEBUCK asked what became of the large deduction of 61. 6s. Was it pocketed by anybody ? Mr. WILSON^ replied that a considerable portion of thi ? deduction went into the aunual revenue of the country a -. fees, some of which svere paid to the Exchequer officers The civil list was debited vrith the exact amount paid, ani no more. Mr. ROEBUCK asked what the fees were? Mr. WILSON procoìsed to make a return of these fees if the hon. member would move for it. Mr. ROEBUCK gave notice that he would move for the return on Monday next. ORDER OF BUSINESS. Sir G. GREY announced that it was intended that the House should sit to-morrosv (this day), »t Î2 o'clock, for the purpose of receiving such bills as might be sent down from the Lords. THE ARMY. Colonel NORTH asked the President of the Board of Control whether all appointments in India for which the officers of the Indian army were eligible woiüd_be throsvn open to those of Her Majesty's army 'i Mr. V. SMITH replied that many of the appointments in qnestion had aiteady'been opened to officers of the Queen's army, and other relaxations in the same direction svere contemplated ; but theie were certain appointments which, owing to the character of the duties annexed to them, could not be filled svith efficiency by other officers than those of the Indian army. THE MAIL SERVICE. Mr. H. G. LANGTON asked the Secretary to the Treasury whether it was intended, previously to their entering upon the service, to test the speed of the steamvessels proposed to be employed under a recent contract in the conveyance of the Australian mails, seeing that, by the copies of the tenders now before the House, the time occupied by the voyage from Suez to Melbourne would require a speed of 11 or 11"; knots an hour, whereas the vessels tendered for the performance of the duty were set dosvn at a speed of ? knots per hour only ? Mr. WILSON said that tlie vessels would be surveyed on behalf of the Government by an officer of the Admiralty, but it was not intended to make any preliminary test of tbeir speed, the principle on which the contracts were framed being that the parties who took them bound themselves undei- h-.avy penalties, ss-hich were invariably enforced, to perform the service within a stated period. The whole responsibility, therefore, rested on the contractors. (Hear, hear.) The vessels had been already in the seivice of the Giove-nmeiit, and were favourably reported on by the departments which had employed them. Mr. H. G. LiiNGTON inquired svhether, in order to insure the regular performance of the contract for conveying the maus between Suez and Australia, any clause would be introduced by which the 'contract would be forfeited in the event of the service not beingperformed within the maximum number of days tendered for-viz., 39 days outwards, and 35 days homeward. Mr. WILSON replied that, in the event of the service not being performed srithin the stipulated period, tho parties would be liable to the heavy penalties to which tie had already alluded. Moreover, there was in this contract a clause enabling Government to put an end to the engagement at any time if they should be dissatisfied with the inaimer in which the service was carried on. INDIA In answer to questions from Mr. Mu BROU GH, Mr. V. SMITH observed that certain documents relative to Tanjoie, oidered on the 15Ui of April last, had been presented on the 17th inst., and that there was an heir to the late. Nabob of the Carnatie, but his dignity was merely titular, the Nabobship having ceased to exist. TKE PATENTS OF SECRETARIES OF STATE. In reply to Mr. Murkough, The CHANCELLOR cf the EXCHEQUER observed that the law officers of the Crown had given an opinion to the effect that it was desirable that the usage heretofore followed with respect to the obligation of Secretaries of State to take out patents for their office should be maintained, and as long as the law remained unchanged that practice wouid be adhered to. Mr. MURROUGH inquired whether, that being the case, ii was to be understood ihat such Secretaries of State as had neglected to pay for their patents would do ?? now ? The CHANCELLOR of tho EXCHEQUER-Assuredly. ?? the Secretaries of State now in office will take out their patents. (Hear, hear.) THE REPORT OF THE CHELSEA COMMISSIONERS. Mr. LAYARD.-I am anxious to put to the noble lord at the head of the Government a question of some importance and i venture to hope that the House will kindly permit me to preface it with a few explanatory observations. (Hear hear.) It will be in the recollection of hon. member' that about a year ago my hon. and learned friend the. member for Sheffield moved for the appointment .Of a committee, popularly known as "the Crimean Committee.--' The noble lord the First Minister of the CiosRTi. endeavoured to prevail -upon the House not to grant that committee, and, to make his appeal the more persuasive, he undertook that he would himself institute an investigation into the disasters which bef ell our-army, see that justice was done to the country and to our soldier. who perished before Sebastopol, and, in a word be our leader. (Hear, hear.) In pmsuance of this imdertiiking two«very eminent officers were sent out to the Crimea svhere they prosecuted their inquiry with great zeal and energy. . They had at hard all requisite means for carrying on-the investigation-; they took copious evidence, and on -«turning to this country prepared a report, which was laid upon the table of this house. In consequence of the statementscontained in thai report I gavo notice of my intentioa to bring forward ä motion expressive of the deep regret of tms Souse that honours, rewards, and promotion shoull have been bestowed on the inculpated officers. Thereupo ? thenoble lord expressed his willingness to advise Her Majesty toãppoint a -aiiitary commission to' mquire into the' ítport of the,C-áme-ii Commis-ioners. This offer' having - b^sKT-Inìado Lwithdrew my notice of motion, and Tefraïned fromjtaking^any further steps in the'matter,· for ¿yO'nl«"v object .was that full and complete justice should be done to all,· paru»·' ? .'I ' 'shall forbear ' 'from "saymg ' anything · 'as it* the^:.feelings; with- which the countiy has received , .-,·..·.-. ., - y -. r-f -. y- ? r-, r ir .- ?.- , .-? --_--. ..«aiertpo-t:-*äiat,r-i»-í «?-uuiated troni tb* military comjtiissioii .which sat at Cbelaea..

(Hear, hear, )? Lord PALMERSTON.-The questions ofthe hon. gentlemen appear to me somewhat imusual, for he requires not a statement of facts, but an expression of opinion. (Hear, hear.) I must object to one portion of the hou. gentleman's observations-that in which he stated or implied that the Board of General Officers which sat at Chebea was appointed to inquire into "and report on the pioceedings of the Crimean Commission. This is not an accurate statei ment óf the case. The purpose for which the Board of General Officers which sat at Chelsea was appointed was to receive explanations from certain officeis who felt that their conduct had been brought into question by certain passages in the report of the Crimean Commissioners. It was to afford to those officers an opportunity of exculoation, and not to reinvestigate tha report of the latter commissioners, that the Chelsea Cornmission was instituted The hon. member says that he has read their report, but allow meto mquire whether he has read the evidence on which that report is based? Mr. LA YARD.-Ihave. Lord PALMERSTON.-b that case ihe hon. gentieman is qualifiea to pronounce an opinion on ihe question hut I do not believe that the majority of this Househas enjoyed ihe same advantage. In conclusion, I have only to observe that it is not the intention of Her Majesty's Government to found any lurther proceedings on the report of the Chelsea Commissioners, (bear, hear.) BISHOPS OF LONDON AND DURHAM REHREMSNT BILL. ^^^ On ihe order of the day for the third reading of this bill Lord PALMERSTON said, there were a few bills standing for a third reading which it was desirable should be sentup to the other House before it adjourned. When those bills badbeen disposed of he would move tbat the other orderso* the day be postponed to enable the right hon. gentlemai. (Mr. Disraeli) to proceed with his statement. The bül having been read a third time, and various verbal amendments introduced, on the questioa that the measure pass, Mr. HADFIELD condemned the clause in the hill which restricted the time within which it should be competent for the Government to effect'a readjustment of the diocess, revenues, and patronage of the see of London, to a period of three years. Sir G. GREY explained, and defended the provision thus impugned. Mr. ROEBUCK said, that supposing the dowager bishopifhe might so term him-died, and a bill dealing witb the diocess of London were introduced, and it shared the fate of somany ofthe noble lord's measures,-viz., was massacred among the other innocents, at the end of threo yeais the Legislature would find this enactment an obstacle to any contemplated improvement. The power of Parliarnent was theoreticaliy unlimited, so much so that Dclolme had remarked that it could do anything but convert a female child into a male one. (Alaugh.) Practically, however, the case was very different, and the objection tbat they were flying in tho face of an act of Parliament could always be used with effect. Lord PALMERSTON observed that, if a bishop had held his see for a series of years, it was natural that he should think it hard on him to make an arrangement considerably curtailing his patronage and emoluments, and extensively changing his position. This clause, however, had been lnserted perhaps írom over-caution. (Hear, hear.) It was scarcely necessary, inasmuch as whoever succeeded to the see would receive his appointment on tha understanding that he would be subject to any change, within reasonable limits, which Parliament might make. It was too late then to alter the clause ; but supposing a bill to be brought in, and to fail in being carried until the three years had expired, the bishop would of couise have received previous notice of the new arrangement that had been contemplated ; and in any subsequent attempt at legislation this cireumstaiice would, doubtless, be fairly considered. Mr. KINNAIRD suggested that the clause should be amended in the other house. On tho motion of Mr. Heslev, the following was inserted in lieu of the original preamble:" Whereas it is expedient to make provision for certain annual sums to be paid in case of the resignation of the Right Hon. and Right Rev. Charles James Lord Bishop of London, and ihe Right Rev. Edward Lord Bishop of Durham, respectively." The bill then passed. Mr. ROEBUCK said that he had a remark to make on the question as to affixing the title to the bül. The SPEAKER said that this was a Lords· bill, the title to which was never affixed by the Commons. (" Hear hear," and a laugh.) ' Mr. ROEBUCK in that case could speak on the question lhat the Clerk take the bill to the other House. ( " Hear, hear," and a laugh.) He had a right to complain of the conduct of the noble lord'(Palmerston) towards him. The noble lord doubtless did not intend anything disrespectful to him, but the fact was nevertheless the same. When he (Mr. Roebuck) yesterday proposed an alteration in committee, the noble lord stated that he fully agreed with him, and promised that the alteration should be made on the third reading. But the bill had now been read a third time and that promise was aot fulfilled. The Clerk was then directed to carry the bill to the other house. EVIDENCE IN FOREIGN SUITS BILL, This bill was read a third time and passed. SHEEP, &c., CONTAGIOUS DISEASES PREVENTION BILL. This bill was read a third time and passed. PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS (SCOTLAND) BILL. On the order of the day for the consideration of the Lords' reasons for disagreeing to the Commons' amendment to the Lords' amendment, and insisting on one of the Lords' amendments, The LORD-ADVOCATE said that, under the circumstances in which the House was now placed with regard to this bill, he felt it his duty to move that the order be discharged. The motion was agreed to, and the order svas accordingly discharged. ° HAY AND STRAW TRADE BILL. This bill was read a third time and passed. STOKE POGE5 HOSPITAL BILL. This ?? svas also read a third time and passed. -S-3VIEW OF TP SESSION. Mr. DISRAELI then rose, pursuant to notice, to move for a. return of the.number of public bills and tbeir titles,· the orders f or which in any of their stages have been discharged during the present session, and the date of ihe discharge of each of such orders. The right hon. gentleman said,-Sir, I wish before we disperse toask the House to consider the course of public business d«_ring the present session of Parliament. I take ihis step with no intention of preferring any indictment against those who are laainly responsible for the management of affairs in this house. I have never deemed that tho last day of the session afforded the most convenient or the most fair occasion for prosecuting a party attack, and I should not have mado the motion I am about to place in your hands were I not convinced that there are great evils and even dangers connected with onr present position, and did I not believe thai, inthe course of this iliscussion, some suggestion may perhaps .be thrown out which may, during the long recess, produce an influence upon the public mind, and may lead to the application-when we meet again-of some remedy for those grievances which I am about to bring under your notice. Sir, the course I am taking is one which is not usual.. It is a course, aslhave already said, whichlthink ought not lo be.resorted to. as a weapon of*party warfare, «nd the history of our proceedings shows that it has noi been our habit'to have recourse to it with that object. ? Indeed, on looking for precedents for-thè'course ïhave adopted, Iain nbtasyare thatthere is more than one to which I could refer ä s an -authonty, and that precedent it would not become jhe to adduce, for.it was, made, by myself iu the year ISiSl.« when.Ifeltitmy dutyio sskj the House to. conãder the iòurse'of'.puhBcbusme-saiiring the session then about toglose.

That sétóou wasI believe, one of almost unparalleled driratioiiiu th« arinalssof Parliament.· The House of Commons hid sat for 10'con, secutive months, and it is not to "be denied that at ^the end; oí that time the account of our labours was of a very fruit.' less Ehaxacter. Great ;ö__»_»tisfacl5on and 'discontent pre.' .vailed throughout the country in consequence, and many reasons were urged -mdmaiiy causes were alleged why s. -prolonged a sitting had been productive 'of such slight and' unsatii-factoryrosiilts. It, was,said,'then-and this wa»1» very prevalent mode of »«»counting'f or the mortifying circuinstancesl have mentioned-that the forms of theHouse were in fault,-that they were, not suited to the age in. which we live, and to the multifarious and multiplied trans actions with which wo have to cope. Again, it was said ! that another cause which produced these unsatisfactory! results was the too frequent discussions which took place iu. ibis-house. It was said that there existed on the part of members of Parliament too great a desire to expres« their opinions, and too much eagerness to debate the questions which were submitted to their consideration. It appeared to me that both these --legations had a very dangerons tendency at all times, but especially in 1848, bt> cause Parliament was then young, and there were, I believe, 280 new members in the house. Nothing, I apprehend,- ? moré to be deprecated than, that men who have recently entered this house, and who, rønséqueutly, hâve ho great experience as to the mode in which our proceedings are conducted, should believe that in the stendiug oiders and forms of the House there are obstacles to the satisfactory prosecution of public business. Those who are acquainted ?svith the proceedings of this House knowthat its formshave been framed after deep thought and mature experience, and that the allegation to wliich I have referred has Httle founda. tion. The second charge, that ihe members of this House were too prone to discussion, was one which ought always, I ti-ink, to be received with great suspicion; for what is this House if it is not a house of discussion ? It is a House of Parliament, and- its very name denotes its character. It is a house of free and ample Bpeech, and whatever questions there may be as to the policy of our legislation, however little the labours of cur investigating committees may be appreciated, I have always thought, and I still think, that the main claim we have upon the confidence, und I hops the affeciion, of the people is this-that thera is a general, a prevalent, and a well-formed conviction in the country that there is at least cue place in England where, in the long run, truth will always be elicited. Well, Sir, at that time so anxiousand naturally anxious-were the Government of the day to avail themselves of any plausible excuse to divert from themselves the rising odium which attended the results of our Par-samsmtaryb"boursthat the Prime Minister absolutely proposed and nominated a committee to mquire into the subject of the forms of the House, and to ascertain whether those forms reaUy were obstacles to the conduct of public business, and how they might be mollified in order to facilitate its prosecution. The noble lord the member for the city of London, who was then Prime Minister, was"" a member of that committee. Among its other members were the late Sir R. Peel, the late Mr. Goulburn, the right hon.' member for Carlisle (Sir ?. Graham) I believe, and Mr Cobden ; and the commitiee had also the advantage of the valuable experience and judgment of the hon. member for Malten. I, also, was a member of the committee, and we gave great attention to the subject. We examined a membor of the American House of Assembly with respect to the roles whicii applied to pnblic business in the United State.. We examined an illustrious exile then in this country, who had been Prime Minister of France, and who was a great master of debate-M. Giiizot, on the subject, and the results of the deliberations of the committee are now amon» the records of ihis House. I did not want the information I obtained as a member of that committee to convince me that it was neither the forms of the House nor freedom of discussion that had prevented the satisfactory accomplishment of public business in 1S48 ; and it was in accordance svith the fe-ungs, and at the desire of many of my friends, that I undertook the laborious task of reviewing a session which had lasted forlOmonths, and of proving, Ihope^__however I may have failed in other objects-that neither of the causes alleged had the slightest influence upon ihe course of public business during that session, and of vindicating, as I trust completely, the House of Commons in that respect. It is for the same object, and actuated by the same feelings, that I have brought forward this motion to-day. I do not think it is a motion that ought tobe made except in particular circumstances, and circumstances of great emergency I think it is of the utmost importance that we should discover what is the cause of that general discontent and dis. satisfaction with the labours ofthis House which could not have been anticipated in the session, but which, I think, it is almost acknowledged has within the last six weeks or two months suddenly arisen in the public mind. I will admit that I do not by any means maintain that it is a matter of co urse on the part of theMinistei-of this country to be too prone to legislation. On the contrary, I think that the Minister is the last member of this House who should interfere in matters ofthat kind. I think that, as a general rule, it is besi that the Minister should not interfere with any subject which requires legislation unless he feels convinced he can deal with it satisfactorily and conclusively. I should say that when there may bo traestions that greatly interest the public mind, though ihere may be a restless and, even in a certain degree, a rational feeling in the nation that these questions should be dealt with,'it is possible that the time may not be ripe f oi their solution, and in these circumstances they rather fall to the lot of independent members of this House, who may shape their preliminary discussion, and by imparting knowledge and ultimately eliciting truth place them ina position with which the Minister, ldtimafely, may advantageously deal with them. Therefore, Sir, I should never impute blame to any Minister if I found that he was somewhat reserved in the matter of legislation, and was not piepared to ask the House to sanction measures upon any great topics unless he felt convinced that there was an urgent necessity for thair introduction. Again, I can conceive a state of affairs in which a Minister, anxious to do his duty to his Sovereiga and his country, may yet discharge that duty in Parliament by merely asking the House to fulfil their highest functionviz., that of granting supplies to Her Majesty for the services of the State. He may not feel it to be his duty, or necessary, to ask for ]the attentive consideration of the House to questions of another character. Again, I can easily believe this-for I am anxious to state the case as fairlyas possible-thatthongh-M-ndstermay be conscious that there are subjects of great importance that demand the consideration of Parliament, yet there may be circumstances at the moment which would not authorize his soliciting the judgment of Parliament regarding them. The country may be involved in war-in a great struggle-and I can «mderstand the Minister then-though he may be of Opinion that there are subjects of internal interest thai TCCjuire a speedy and ultimate settlement,-holding the' opinion that, ina crisis of that'n ature, all the exigencies of ihe Government being re^mied to prosecute the war; he has ä right to appeal with confidenco to the forbearing spirit and temper of Parliament, and not bring forward those measures. (Hear, hear.) I can also conceive that there may be another occasion in which a Mmister may find he has* claim to legislative forbearance. We may not be positively at war, but we may be on ihe point of accomplishing a peaceAll the intelligence and vigilance of the Ministry may- be, required to carry on the important negotiations whieh are to conclude the war in which wo may be engaged, and to f orm the foundations of a settlement that rnay possibly insure ihe enduring peace of Europe. In these ciicumstances I also can easily conceive' that the Minister- may be, ""ustified in not applying to Pariiament for any legislation hut such as-may be necessary to- in-- sure ; the supplies for the year. But -these thMepleas, the noble lord cannot avail himself of, ' should he think it right to answer the frank and fair criticism whichlmay offer onthe course he haspursued. : Thenoble lord, in the first place, caimot-say to-night that-it'is his opinion we háve iègiskted, enough, and'that there aie no' pressingquestionsof'great^^importance svhich Trequire our attention, because the noble lord has" volimtarily, in this sessioli of'Patli-meni," miroduoed i^õnr ¿notice ??* only questions of great mportance, huiy asi think I shsUbe able toiüiow, a greater niunber bf questionsóf · great importaasa ' thanproiiâHyany-ITiníster-evermltódu 'to 'Psrüametit; (Hearj heat.);-;î?or çan thenóble lord-avail liimself .of- the. ???????1??? -that', ¡ads «»imt-ry beigir involved in war, and in - ftrøadé-ahle's"^ Jbat ahyrof .tiie-e-"'IèEÎ--ativèupMpbsiu_ .'-h^iild^havélheèn' jr^e-to-thermr-'»»use ^the -noble lord at - the- .oo"mmocmçnt"oï,:ti?^ àimtry was iá* st»té ofí far, »dvised.

AU will acknowledge that that is a question-which. may be described as the "äreatest of legal questions. In all' countries it may be described as the greatest of legal questions; but in this countryit is more tiianihejp-eatestoflegiX questions, becauseit is alsothe greatest of cönstitational questions, becaiiso.iuhavingtoconsiderthecreationand constitu«tion of ahigh twurt of appeal, «va have, from the nature of our institutions, not only to fulfil that great object, but webave incidentally to consider even the very elements of a, Senate, or rather of an Upper Chamber. (Hear, hear.l We have been «¡ailed upon this year to consider a new law of partnership, íxamed upon new principles and adaptedto thisradvanced age, which should facilitate the application oE capital to commerce in the most commercial country in the» world. We havo been called upon to consider the wholelaw oi divorce and an important change in the law of marriage. .We havebeen called upon to consider the wholet» mscipline of ihe church ; the testamentary jurisdiction o£ the country ; the police of tha country ; a referai of the most ancient, the most wealthy, and the most powerful municipality, intimately connected with the history andliberties of Engbnd ; the »superannuation of the whole civil service of the country ; the criminal appropriation of trust property ; the edttcation_of a whole kingdom ; the retirementrof bishops from their sees, and last, but not least, the correct means of ascertaining the most important produce of the>empire by a system of agricultural statistics. Why, Sir, these are not light questions. They are not only among themost irrave that concern a State, but ihey involve the very principles upon which society itself is based. Sir, I do notknow that I can place the legislative scheme of the Ministrymore fairiybefore the House than by referring to the Speech.- from toe Throne at the commencement of the session, and reminding the House of the propositionsthat then, upon ths highest sanction and authority, were siibrnitted to our consideration. There weref our measures, or, I wouldrathersay, four series of measures which, m the heai of war. Her Majesty recommended to ourattentivecoasideration. Thefirst-- which was the simplest-applied to the a_sin_ilation of tha mercantile law of England and of Scotland. The second· wasthatimprovement inthe law of partnership, fouuded altogether upon new principles, and aiming at the increased' application of capital to commerce, to whieh I have already referred. The third wasa measure which was to relieve thomercantile marine of this mercantile country from caargesr ofs great weight -under which it had long'laboured, and against which it had long complained. The fourth series of measures, and perhaps the most important, consisted of large and extensive reforms, first in the 1??? of Great Brit un-. and, next, in the law of Ireland. These, Sir, were the measures which at the commencement of the session-in a time of war-were recommeaded, to use the language of the irracious Speech, to the " attentive consideration" of theHouse of Commons. How bave we dealt with ihese four series.of measures ? With respect to the first question -thet assimilation of the mercantile'law of Englandand Scofland-I cheerfully admit that the Government may be considered to have fairly redeemed their pledge. ? measroeto change the mercantile law of Scotland has now passed, I believe, both Houses, and a measure to change the mercantile law. of England was introduced in this house. Ifc contained, indeed, a principle of the most dangerous kind. which aimed at terminating the neces-ityin commercialtransactions of written contiicts (hear) ; but the practical sagacity of the. House of Commons and the protest of thewhole commercial community saved the country from the dangers of that unfortunate proposition. (Hear, hear.)» Thai portion of the bill was defeated, and the measure so amended was passed. We may therefore adroit that the Government, on the whole, have fairly redeemed thepledjSthey gave with respect to the first series of messures mentioned in the gracious Speech. How, Sir, did we proceed - with regard to ihe improvement of thelawof partner-hip.' What wete tho fortunes of that great bill which was to befounded upon new principles, which was to be adapted to this advanced and enlightened age, and which, in this peculiarly commercial country, was to facilitate the application of capital to commerce? lam bound to admit thatthere svas every evidence of sincerity on the part of theGovernment with respect to this second head, for on the first day we met-the 1st of February-the important measurewas introduced by the Vice-President of ihe Board of Trade-, After discussion-after being amended and reprinted on the 25th of February-on the 10th of March that measure was abandoned. (Hear, hear.) But- HerMajesty's Government, determined to deal with a question which they believed to be of paramount importance, lost notime in profiting by tho discussion which had taken place, and on the 7th of the. ensuing month a second bill to amend the law of partnership and to accomplish all those great objects which I have enumerated was introduced by theright hon. gentleman. Ifind that this second b»U was introduced on ihe 7th of April, and on the 14th of July I find it was abandoned. (Hear, hear.) Here we have an importantsubject recommended to onr " attentive considerÄtion" lithe gracious Speech from ihe throne, aud not only one bill brought in and abandoned by Her Majesty's Ministers, bub a second bill on the samo subject introduced, and also abandoned. That, Sir, is a very remarkable and unfortunate« catastrophe for any department to experience ; but I would take the liberty of reminding the House that it is not peculiar to the Vice-Piendent of the Board of Tradehitherto thought to be so particularly unfortunate m his? legislative enterprises. (A laugh.) I find that the President of the Poor Law Board was not much more successfuL On the 3d of April I find that functionary inb»oducmg a bill for the amendment of the Poor Lasv ; and on'the 23d of May I find ibat measure abandoned. (Hear, hear.) I find the same Minister, profiting equally by his experience, on the 23d of May introducini» another measure on thesame subject, and on the 10th of July I find that measurealso abandoned. (A laugh.) Here we have two Ministers introducing bills upon subjects of the highest moment, and not only failing in their efforts to carry their measures, but recurring again to the experiment, aud -««airt enconnterin!» failure. (Cheers.) But, Sir, this donble failure is not peculiar to the Vice-President of ibe Board of Trader ' and the President of the Poor Law Board The Irish Government, represented, I believe, by the Chief Secretary of the Lord-Lieutenant, introduced on" the loth of April a "bill ? toregulate the lunatic asylums in Ireland, and on the 21st of Mayi. find that measure abandoned. (Hear, hear.) Bat that right hon. gentleman also, not losing heart, two days afterwards introduced another bill onthe same subject, and -on the 14th of July Ifind that second measuire onihe lunatic» asylums of Ireland also abandoned. (Cheera and laughter. > I have mentioned these cases incidentally to illustrate, and in some degree to soften, the positioa of. the Vice-President of the Board of Trade (a. laugh) ; but -tbe result is that -upon three subjects of great moment three Mini_ters try their hand at legislation, fail in their efforts, not disheartened again make the attempt, and are again self-baffled. (Cheers.) So much, Sir, for thelaw of partnership. Let us now look to the third subject mentioned in the gracious Speech.

LONDOX, SATU9DAY, JULY 26, 185. In the House of Lords last night, Lord W&NSL7EYDALE took the oaths and his seat as an hereditary Peer. Certain returns connected with estates assessed to the land-tax in India were ordered on the motion of Lord CGL ICARDE. Lord ST. VRcmrC asked certain questions as to the intentions of -the Government on a matter arising out of the judgment recently delivered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Mr. DYcx SoLuBun's will case. The Marquis of LAsnDowvNu replied that it was not the intention of the Government to take any steps in the matter. He could fully understand the feelings of the noble lord, but he thought no public good could arise out of a discussion on such a subject. The amendments of the Commons to the Leases and Sales of Settled Estates Bill were then considered, and rejected on a division in wbich the nunnbers were equal. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to MIr. LAYARD, Lord P.sTox said, the Chelsea Board of General Officers had been appointed to receive explanations from certain officers who had considered that their conduct had been brought into question by certain passages in the report of the Commissioners, and to enable them to exculpate themselves; and that it wvas not the intention of the G;overnment to found any proceedings upon the report of the board. The Bishops of London and Durham Retirement Bill was read a third time, and, after undergoing certain amendments and a brief discussion, passed. Ot;her bills were likewise read a third time and passed. Mr. DISRAELI, inmoving, agreeably to notice, for a retLrn of the public bills the orders-for which, in any of their stages, had been discharged during the present session, said, he was about to ask the Rouse to consider the course of their proceeding before the session closed, without any intention of prefernrng an indictment against those who were responsible for the management of affairs in the house ; but, convinced that there was danger in their present position, he hoped that in the course of the discussion some observationx might be thrown out which would have a beneficial effect upon the public mind, aud it was of importance to discover the cause of the prevalent discontent and disiatisfaction in respect to the labours- of the House. The Firat 1inister, he observed, could not plead that Parliament had legislated enough, and that no questions of great portrce required its attention, because he had introduced a greater number of questions of importance than probably any Minister had ever pro-- po.sed to Parliamnent. Nor -could he plead that we were in70kved in war, since, while the country was engaged -'nFwar' the Speech' 'from 'the Mhrono recommoended to the House to give its attention to lany subjects of internalintereit. Nleither could he avail himself of the plea that negotiations fopeace had thrown obstacles in the pith of legisation, for other measures- had been introdueed pending those'negotiations. Ar. DisR.AMIr thenl enumerated various: measures of. great importance, several of them recommended in the Royal Speech,-which had been introduced:by the Governmernt and abandoned, iiicluding a new aNw of partnership,. a law of' divorce' and marriage, and the testamentary jurisdiction. Of five-great projects of imperial law, each of uiigent siecessity and demand,ing, in the, opinion of the Cuowx,'the attention ;of Parliament,. not one had- passed' that House. Five measures of legal refoim ielating to Ireland had been introduced and in like manner abandoned. *Many other measures of great importance not referred to in the QuEEN'S Speech,-the superannuatioh of the whole Civil Service,' the reforma of the lCorporation of tle city of London, . the local management of the metropolis, vaccination, pauper removal,-had shared the sam e fate. Was this, he asked, a satisfactory 'state of affaira' 'He thought not, and that the time was come when the House would do well to inquire what was its cause. It could not be said that this catastrophe was occasioned by the :House itsef--by protracted debates and long speeches. He believed the cause of the failure or legislation was mainly, if not entirely, attributable to the fact that thne present Miistry could not command a Parliamentary majority. And this fact was, he said, productive of the evil that, when the Government found there was a chance that their measures would not succeed, they ceased to prepare them with scrupulous exactitude, fineness, and maturity of care. He denied th'at this want of Parliamentary sympathy was owing to the effects of the zeform in the representation, or to the extinction or dislocation of parties, and he justified this latter position by an analysis of the principles and opinions of parties with reference to foreign as well as domestic politics, maintaining that there were distinctive opinions in the country as regarded our policy towards Russia, Austria, and the United States, and that, it was idle to pretend that parties had ceased tc, exist. He gave credit to the present Ministry for pursuing a policy in harmony with Conservative principles, and, if so, could it be said that parties were broken up? There was, he said, a Conservative party and a Conservative policy, and if thepresent Government were pursuingthat policy the inference that that party was extinct was erroneous. Wnat party was extinct he would not say; he left that conclusion to the country; but if the present system continued the Liberal party would be thrown back 50 years, and nothing could long resist the deleterious influence under which they were placed with reference to power. |Lord PAasRsToN, after some sarcastic remarks upon Mr. DrsnAzms's dissertation on parties, and his attempt to produce a schism among the Liberal party, observed that, while, on the one hand, he had reproached the Government with abandoning liberal views, in the early part of his speech he had accused them of inundating the House with more measures than it was possible to pass. He did not admit that the public mind was imnpressed with a notion that there had been a deficiency of legilation during the session. When Mr. DasRnAna complained of many measures introduced by the Government having failed, and inquired the cause, he answered, SL cautsam qTuris circurnspice; it was on account of the obstacles they met with, chiefly from the Opposition side of the House. He did not state this by way of reproach; it was attributable to a system of things from which great and inestimable benefits were derived. When measures were introduced by the Government it must not be supposed that their success depended upon their merits or demerits ; they must necessarily mneet with resistance, partly from prejudice, partly from want of information, and even from interested motives. This wa;s the unavoidable consequence of free institutions and free opinions, and time was required that the measures might be -well understood. The slowness of theprogress of legislation was mortifying to those who brought in measures, and exposed the RHouse to censure by ardent spirits; yet, on the whole, he thought it wwas an advantage to the country, because measures, however good, might fail if too hastily carried. If so many measures had failed, it was through no want of diligence on the part of that House, and, as far as concerned the Government, it should be remembered how little time was at its command. The whole amount of time available for Government bils during the session was only 22 days. He was not sure, he added, that if they had the choice as to some of the measures which had been alluded to, it was not better that they should stand over for more mature consideration until another session. There was nothing, he thought, in the statement of Mr. DsAYu that should, in the slightest degree, weaken the confidence which the country felt in this branch of the Legislature. Mr. M. GIssor said, he found fault wvith Lord PArwERsToN because he was too ready to abandon a good measure, as in the case of the Local Dues on Shipping Bil. He hoped he would, next session, use his induence to bring forward, with the authority of a united Cabinet, a bill for the repeal of the oath of abjuration. He hoped, too, that he wvould not listen to the call for large military and naval establishments, but show that he was a sincere economist. After some observations upon a diversity of topics by Mr. sAPEgR, Mr. MowvsRA&Y, Mr. Wm- :nsoN, MIr. H.Anrn.r, Mr. BAriNs, Mr. VAYcE, Mr. InyworsT, and Mr. LowE, the motion was agreed to. The remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at a-quarter to 9 o'clock.
We do not recommend MIr. DIsRAELE again to emulate Lord LYNDHnUST in a revieV of the Session. The criticism which we should offer on his speech would be, that the first part was contradicted by the second, and both overruled by the third; that it was rambling without being comprehensive, and full of detail without being accurate-in fact, that he contrived to spoil a good case, to damage his own party and himself, and to benefit those whom he assailed. We pass over his professions of a total absence of all party feeling and objects as unwvorthy attention when taken in connexion with what followed, and come to his enumerAtion of measures abandoned by the Govermment. In this enumeration it is very easy to see that Mr. DisnAsLi has paid no very strict attention to the business of the Session, and has been led into many errors wvhich might have been ascribed to design, but which we are convinced were the result of pure ignorance. Indeed, it has long been remarked that Mr. DisBi is never known to take any part in the legislative business of the Houxse, but reserves himself for great occasions, leaving to Mr. HEIENLY or Mr. WALPOLE the inglorious duties of wrangling in committee. We cannot,therefore, wonder that his knowledge of the Session's business is mainly derived from the Orderbook, and that no one was less able to give an account of it than the leader of the Conservative party. Passin' over his inaccuracies, some of which were, and many more of which might have been exposed, we ask what conclusion is to be drawn from so many miscarriages e lis conclusion is this notable one,-that Government -does not possess the confidence oI a majority of thefouse of Commons. Now, the conclusion which seems to follow legitimately from the introduction and withdrawal of a large number of measures is, that they were either bad in themselves, introduced at improper times, ill advocated, or not diligently and heartily prosecuted. From all these unfavourable inferences Mr. Dir.Aeni at once relieves the Government by tracing its failure to carry measures to a cause not within its own control,-the absence of confidence in it by a majority of the House of Com- mons. Having thus unintentionally quite exonerated tlhse whom he meant to accuse, MIr. DIsnAELI next proceeds to demolish his exculpation. Government,. 'he admits, does possess the confidence of the House oi many subjects, such as war and peace, the .maling of treatiesa and the preservation of the ]2onour of the country, and thus he entirely destroys -his own solution, that the reason Government withdtre#so many biUs was that it did not possest the confideace of the-Houiseof Commons. But even this cofifusion of ideas is not enough, for Mr. DxrsA3mr, bivn,, admitted that Lord PAMESrTozes Government does po ess tie confidenoo of t1e House on foreign' affairs, immiytel proceedsz to xhow where they are wrong, and instances the' cases of Russia,..of Ahstria, and ofiAnieric ; and, fl6undering atill deeper. in the mire, having adduced every argiiment. liih ccIdbebrougAt toihorwthatthejies of kare iwe6lred, andthat The House.isbroken up into sections' not absolutely ander the control of any party feeling' or any' leader, he coneludes by proving to bis'own-party that they still exist, that they have pPinciples of their- own, that they have a leader,-to,wit,.himself,-and that they have vatious ' grounds of. consolation', though we are not. .informed for --what caTamity. Apparently, of all these things the Conservative party have very egrave doubts, for they listened to the assurance of . their leader that they were not eitinct witho"ut givinig the slightest signs of life to confirm his hssurance,: and heard the confession of their political faith made for them, without condescending to ratify it by a single "Amen." We should think it will be necessary for 31r. DISRAEr. and his so-called supporters to review their relations to each other, for a leader without followers is almost as sorry a spectacle as a party without leaders, and to zexhibit botlh these peculiarities at once must severely tax the yitality of any political combination. Now, al this accumulation of miscarriages we trace entirely to Mr. Disnin's extraordinarily bad management. He had an excellent case if he had known how to state it and use it, No impartial person can deny that measures have been introduced and abandoned with a levity vhich may be palliated, but cannot be excused. To have made an accnra;e list of such abandon-ments, and to have made himself mnaster of the circumstances which attended each, would have enabled BIr. DisRAium to make a damaging attack on his political opponents, and to rally in some degree his own dispirited followers. But first to attacl on one ground, then to shift it to another, then to disown that, and, finally, to vind up by abandoning the attack where he was strong and his antagonists weak-to make it where they were strong and he weak, with an exposure of the utter disruption of his party, and their total want of confidence in and sympathy with him, was a climax of blunders and absurdities such as has rarely fallen to the lot of any Parliamentary chief to realize. Of course, Lord PAxiurSToN availed himself of the mistake of his adversary -with his usual dexterity. He came forth in the character (always popular in the House) of a defender of the aspersed reputation of the House of Cormmons. He argued, almost in the words of our yesterday's article, that the obstruction to business complained of wau the inevitable consequence of a free constitution, and that -we must accept it together with the benefits that freedom brings us, that our progress, if slow, is sure, and that it is be'ter measures should not pass hastily, nor until the public mind is fit for their reception. Such was the result of the reviewv of the session; vwhereas, had Mr. DisnaLza stuck to his text, it is very easy to imagine that the concdusion might have been altogether different. The debate has in some degree redressed the defeats of the last month, and lent a kind of faint &kt to the session which nothing else could have given. The effect has been to send the Tory party home very doubtful if they are a party at all, not certain if they have any principles, but perfectly convinced that they have no leader. It has given the (Goverinment the opportunity of setting itself right with the House and the country, of removing blame from its own shoulders, and pointing out that to the caprice of the House and tho obstruction of the Opposition quite as much as to itself are due its legislative reverses.
Nfot even the Chelsea Commissiot has been able to deny that there was mismanagement in the winter of 1854. WVe may be sure that if there had been the slightest opening the Board would have refused to admit the fact oi any disaster having occurred. If the cowms ddlidi could be denied, it would of course be unnecessary to proceed with the inquiry, and the acquittal of the implicated officers would be a matter of course. But the facts are too stubborn. It is impossible to assert that the descriptions given by so many and such independent authorities are perfectly baseless. Officers attached to the profession, newspaper correspondents, and travellers for pleasure or business, all have told the same tale. It is, then, beyond the courage even of a jury of Generals to declare that the whole is a mistake or a calumny. They have been content with endorsing the highminded defences of the chief officers concerned. Each is acquitted because the shortcomings of somebody else may be supposed to bear a part in the catastrophe. Sir R. Aruay is acquitted because :Mr. FmDnn's department did not do its duty, while Ir. FnDEit is exonerated because he was chiefly hampered by want of transport-a want for which the Commander-in-Chief is resDonsible. We may consider this matter now at an end, and there is but little use in discussion which can have no practical effect. The answer of Lord I?AnsroN to YIr. LAYAP.D last night shows how little weight is attached to the report which has emanated from Chelsea. It is, no doubt, welcome to the Government, as it excuses them from further proceedings, and enables them to conclude at once the session and the much-vexed Crimean business. But the PRnuu is too experienced and politic to express his approbation, or even his acquiescence in the opinions of the Board. The report of the Crimean Commissioners, we are told plainly enough, stands where it did. binisters will not allow this document, the result of along and painstakdng inquiry at the seat of war, to be nullified by such a decision as has just been pronounced. 33xcept, therefore, as regards the retention of rank and employment by four officers, the Chelsea verdict is utterly unimportant. We may, however, take the opportunity of its promulgation to refer once more to the causes of the disasters in question, and to trace admitted delinquencies to the tre offenders. Lord RAGLAw holds the first place in these transactions. The respect paid to one who is dead, who died, too, if not on the field of battle, at any rate surrounded by the dangers and responsibilities of war, has hitherto closed the mouth of criticism. But the maxim of speaking only good of the dead may be carried too far. In the frst moment of a family's grieÃ¯Â¿Â½, in the first days of a nation's natural regret for an oid and honest soldier who has died in its cause, it is certainly well to be reserved and merciffl But a Commander-in-Chief is an historical character, his doings for good or ill are legitimate suibjects of discussion, and the lapse of a year precludes the appearance of unseemly attacks on a newly-raised tomb. What, then, are 'we to say of our late Commander-in-Chief, as his acts are chronicled in the reports andc evidence derivedfrom twoCommissions? Bravewith ananitquebravery, of moat courteous manners, and, to those cf his owQ class, corlial and Idnd, he naturally kam the warm sympathies ofa circle who can 'ee no defects inhini. J3ut the nation has to Judge of men by the results of their actions. Iet 'the private frienids iÃ¯Â¿Â½ 6 on ,iuoaL. cherish his memaory, ana seek to oDm,nunicate their enthuium to -their countrymen But if the country remains incredulous theymust not be surprised. We do not make teroes of good men or poEte men, but of thoae who do great actions and advance a great causqe . how, how stvads the case with Lord RAGLAN I He had been for 40 years; supreme at the Horse Guards.; he knew, .if any one might be supposed to know, the British army, with, all its 3merits and,defecs, its pez=sonalbravery, the shortcomings of its commissariat; transport, and medical -systemL He wa, in fac,t; at the head of the. very department which. broke down-imost egregiously. ,e had been often abroad, and-had enjoyed in France opportunities oÃ¯Â¿Â½ seeing the details of a great military organization; yet, under, his guidance, the British army-literally the British army, for we had no reserve-. was led blindly to destruction, from which only -he outburst of popular feeling preserved it. For five months was this army in Turley before it embarked for the Crimea; not a few of the deficierncies began to be felt even before it moved from Gallipoli to Varna, -yet, though endowed with unlimited power, though not only requested, but even adjured, by the Government to remedy every defect -with a strong hand, the Commanderin-Chief saw nothing, heard nothing, knew n.othing until the deluge of disaster was upon his devoted troops. Inalltheseinquirieshis namehardlyappears. The government of the army seems to have been a commonwealth of independent Generals and heads of departments. What a Quartennaster-General did in Dublin or Quebec, that he felt necessary to do in the Crimea; he did nothing more, it was not in his department, and no higher power interfered. The Commissariat could not transport provisions for wantof ships andhorses; theyrmade requisitions that were not complied w%ith, men peTished by hundreds, anc: we see . no help come from head-quarters. NAPoLEoN and WEryToN dictated the minutest details of organization, but aMl by which wars are made successful,-feeding, clothing, transport, shelter,-were in this British army abandoned to the fortAitous agreement of some half-dozen departments, each of which, as far as we can see, was carrying on a war of recrimination and provocation with the other. Sir RIcHA-uD A.REY, too, -who will not go one inch beyond the strict limits of his daties as understood on a home station in time of profound peace-had he no means of becoming acquainted with the armys real wants, and the necessity of some breadth of view and some increased exertion to meet a great crisis? We have him pleading, and pleading successfully, that he is not responsiblo for anything more than the making of requisitions for what is necessary-a duty which we should think any subaltern in the army midght equaly perform. We have him exonerating himself by stating that the rugs were half cotton, the coatees too small, the boots unfit for wear, the paillasses useless for want of stuffing. We have him sending for tents and huts two months after the landing in the Crimea, because he had no reason to believe they would be wanted before. If he had come from India or the Cape to his post about the time of the Battle of the Alma there might be some reasonableness in this defence. But what must we say when it is remembered that this man had been hlitary Secretary to the CosrANDsxa-nz-CMFX up to the very day of sailing, must have been aware of the exact state of the army, a confidant of all the doubts, fears, surmises, and anticipations on the subject of the expedition ; that he must have kinown well the terrible suspense of the two Governments, the importance they attached to a decisive campaign, the dreadful consequences of any sluggishness or irresolution at such an hour? Yet he and his subordinate, knowing all this, are content with such a perfunctory discharge of their barest duties, that if they had been the agents of a shipowner or a purveyor they would have been disaissed, as not taking care of their employer's interests. We need not speak of LordsLvoAw andCAxDiGAN;, and of GeneralAirtiS's appropriate adjutant, Colonel Goirow. It is wonderful to find to what men the destinies of a nation can be confided. The matter is now probably discussed for the last time. The Crinean war must now be left to the historian, and the officers who have just been exonerated by the Chelsea Board are beyond any other justice than that which will follow from the judgment of their countrymen now and hereafter. They will wear their orders, and their rank and titles, won amid so muach desolation, will be .blazoned in the face of the world, for of that courage which boldly faces shame they have no lack. But from the verdict of history they cannot escape. They may well hope that obscurity will cover their names, and they may not share the immortality of Yex and lW rMTsocxn; but if the democrat wishes to enlarge on the worthlessness of titles, orders. and distinctions, he will for many a year be able to point his moral by showing how they have been bestowed on Luc Am and CAnDIGA?, APtEs and GoRDox.
There is au old and homely proverb about stirring up dirty puddles which Lord ST. VnfcEa would have done well to remember last night before he invoked the swarthy and licentious spirit of DYcE SowmBR to appear again upon earth. We are not quite so unhackneyed in the ways of London life as to be ignorant of the fact that every week in the season a considerable number of young and middle-aged ladies hand over their fair persons to the wealthiest bidder; but really there is a line which should be scarcely overstepped even by persons most careless of the world's opinion. Money is all very well in its way, but it may be purchased at too dear a price. We must distinguish between money and money's worth. Upon such a theme we are not anxious to dilate, for every notorious instanCe of venality vhich lowers the respect that all men would willingly pay to womanhood lowers the standard of morality, and is a positive injury to the public. Now, what is the case of this wretched MIr. DycE SoMaxm e The story is told in a few words. An Indian magnate, with all the furious blood of Oriental nations boiling in his veins, to his own niisfortune, and to the scandal, as it turned out, of some leading English families, in a lucldess hour for himself made up his mind to abandon the sunny plains of Hindostan, and to cast in his lot with us in England. He had, as was natural enough, and-what is i mor-he was known to have, the Oriental ideas about women. He did not believe, as few Indians would believe, in the chastity of mother, sister, wife, or daughter, unless we speak of chastity in that modified for-m which is dependent 'upon the strength of stone walls, upon the vigilance of guardiasu, and the ingenuity of padlocks. With these ideas in his head, and -with very considerable wealth at his command, he lmded I in England. We rhall always think 'upon the re- sult with a certain degree of shame. As son as he arrived in this country he was fastened upon by certain mnembers of the aristocracy. The manners and mnowri disposition and character of the man went for nothing. He had what lt;Ley wanted-gold. The story is not a lovely one, andi we are sure our readers will 5ppreciate our m9tives if we decline to repeat here certain particulars of. Mr. fvca So;asts eonduct as they were established in evidence before comn- petent courts of justice. Suffice it to.-Ay -that| too many of our great Dunilies tr cl to tltl Hindoo m3onser, just in the sameway asw,L truciled to Gzoaix THix i his p.lmI da. At length le marnid and, ax - we -hae no wish to introdluce a lidy' name into a eomment of this description, -we will mentioui it only so far as is asolutely esa for the elucidation of the-story. rom the moment almost of thix wretched man's mariiagp' he seems to have been given over to wretche new of every description. Even the power of indfilging in almost bodlevi sensuatyblrrought him mo relief, for he was under the influence of a monomania which had ever, irked in his brain, but whihd was called into 'adcivity by the circumstances of his married life. Mr. Drox Somru;, in the irst place, became outrageoudy jealouB of his -vife. This was no more than might lave been exected. 'He was a ERindoo, with IHindoo notiols in his head. Tis firt idea when he vent awsy from home was t tortn the key upon the lady-a proceeding whicl was not likely t;o find' favour m an Englishwoman's eyes. Jealousy begot opposition, and opposition jealousy. lle mischief, which had heretofore been but as a smouldering. fire in the brain of the wretched man, 'Durst forth in full intensity, and tortrd him until the conclusion of his foul mid 'unhappy career. When his wife rebelled against his ideas there was no wildness of accusation upoa which he did not venture. Surely the dianonds and the gold were dearly bought when a name which should have been pure as the diamond and far more precious than all the gold of Eindostan was bandied about in the law reports, and connected with the filthiest charges by the husband's lips t He accused her of manifold auts of unchastity, and even of incest with her own father, Lord ST. VINCENT. No doubt, when matters had arrived at this point a separation was inevitable. io woman could live and breathe the air which had been polluted with so horrible an utterance against her. But why was not all this thought of before? Why 2id not the lady and the family feel that such a result was the inevitable consequence of her and their own act ? We can perfectly wvrell appreciate the agony and burning scorn with which an English lady would learn, if, indeed, she could be brought to understand, that such a charge had been directed against her. We can understand that she would have welcomed death in its diresi; form rather than remain a night under the roof of the man who had made her the subject of so foul an outrage. It would seem but naturri in such a case that a woman so insulted should casi; from her with loathing all that could remind her of the man who had thus insulted her. " Thy money " perish with thee !" would, as one might have supposed, }ave been her first thought. But how stand the facts? The coutt of law were vexed with a protracted litigation, set on foot at the instance of the lady's fa-mily, to deprive Mfr. Dyc*: SosEMR of the management of his property. 'We have just seen the result of the last proceedings in the case of his wilL Surely all this is very bad, and Lord Sr. ViNcrNT would have been far better advised had he let the story pas away from the mruds of men without any further act which might remind them of his own share in the uncomely business. He seems to have been of another opinion, inasmuch as last night he called upon his fellow-peers to avenge him of Lord COMnBMEa--another noble Lord who has been a good deal mixed up with Air. Dycs Som:snx's affairs. The point was, that upon more than one occasion in the course of the legal proceedings vwhch hadbeen directed against the wretched man Iord COMnEBMEsB had interfered by advice-spoken and written-to prepare him for the examinations which he was to undergo before the Doctors. For this reason, and beeause he had upon one occasion so far forgotten himself as to sign a private letter referring to the cause to Lord CorrsHnasr-then Lord Chancellor-his conduct had been severely but most justly censured by that learned judge, and by various other judges, who, from time to time, had been called upon to pronoumce decisions in the case. Lord CoBimEn RBn and Lord St. VYcuna have been antagonists throughout the wholebusiness. The latter last night called the attention of the Government to the various pvssages in the judgments in which unfavourable mention was made of Lord Coxsrvms's conduct. To such an attack there could be but one answer, and Lord LA?esDowsZ made it. The House could not tak-e notice of circumstances which had occurred in the course of a civil suit, more especially when the individual arraigned before his fellow-peers had not been a party to the suit. So the sabject dropped, and we hearily recommerLd Lord ST. VDNCFWr to drop it, at once and for ever. No good will come, no credit will ever edound to him or his, from strring up mud of so very decided a chabacter.

THE CASE OF ARCHDEACO 't DENISOiY. BATH, JuLY 2-5. The Court resumed its sittings this morning at half-pastl0, when Dr. i. PIULLIrcoss commenced his defence of the Archdeacon of Taunton.-He said, it appeared from the evidence that about two years arid a-half ago arespectable grocer in Wells Cathedxal hear.d a sermon preached which e conceived to be contrary to the doctrine of the church of England. He bore in his mind a particular passage, which he repeated verbatin et iiteratitn at the end of theso two years and a-half. He unfortunately did not bear in his mind the sentences which immediately preceded or followed the one which he repeated. He remembered nothing but this particular passage he communicated what he remembered to the other archdeacon of the diocess, who commnunicated it to the oreseit prosecutor, Mr. Ditcher, the Vicar of South Brent, who forthwith proceeded against Archdeacon Denison, the Vicar of East Brent, the defendant in the present suit. Dr. Thillimore proceeded to say that the result of the Clevedon Commission illustrated what he raust call the topsy-turvsy condition of the church which the act under which these pr'ceedings were taken had introduced. Now, what was the awful subject which in that Gaildhall,in open court, they were called on to discuss as if they were dealing with any common offenee before his ,Grace? Why, it wasno lessasubjectthanthemysteryof the holy Eucharist-that subject which an authority cited by his learned friend (Hooker) had declared it became laymen not to enter into, but in the silence of their hearts to acknowledge. Now,whatwas the findingof theComlnissionere, and what were the Articles of the church touching this matter? The fmding of the Commissioners was not a simple finding that there was a prim4 facie case for further proceedings but they declared their unanimous opinion 'that the proposition of the venerable Archdeacon of Taunton 'That to all who come to the Lord's table, to those who eat and drink worthily, and to those who eat and drink unworthily, the body and blood of Christ are given; and that by all who come to the Lord's table, by those who eat and drink worthily, and by those wyho eat and drink unworthily, the body and blood of Christ are received is directly contrary or repugnant to the doctrine of the church of England; and especially to the Articles of religion; and that the doctrines, as set forth ifn the aforesaid sermons, vith reference to the real presence in the Holy Eucharist, are unsuported by the Articles taken in their literal and ;rammati sense, are contrary to the doctrines and teaching of the church of England, and have a very dangerous tendency." It had been attempted to beshownthattheArchdeaconhadpropounded the doctrine of oral manducation. There was no such statement from beginning to end in the sermons, nor in the Articles. The next DOint for consideration was, what were the issues raised in this case? They appeared to him to be two with only one of which was he concerned. The two issues, then, were these-What was the correct doctrine with respect to the Holy Eucharist ? The next issue was what was the doctrine which the church of England allowed to be admissible? And that was the issue to which he should address himself. Dr. Phillimore then quoted several passages from the judgment delivered in the Gorhan case from which he arived at the conclusion that, wherever an Article admitted of a reasonable or different interpretation--such different interpretations were admissible doctrines to be held by the church of England. The learned counsel then proceeded to argue, on each of the four charges advanced fainst the Archdeacon of Taunton, that a larve number of drInes of the church of England had held simar i ions Archdeacon D&yrsox then rose and said,- y Lord Archbishop, may I be allowed, in the peculiar and painful circumstances in which I am placed, to say a few words? I have once had such an application refused,which I believe was never beforefased to any man in England. Dr. LuSsnxNGTON made an observation which was inaudible to the reporter. Archdeacon DnsisoN.-Well, I will only say that if this Scripture proof is refused to me, if I am prevented from showing that my doctrine is not contrary to the doctrine of the church of ngland,anud that if her Articles were appealed to 29 out of the 39 would confirmn me, then I say, I throw the burden of the refusal upon this Court. (Sensation.) I will leave the court; I will carry my defence elsewhere. Dr. P mLmiboscE then requested an adjournment till next morning to consult with his client To which tte Co.R, agreed.
CAB LAW. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES. Sir,-Permit me to call your attention to the nagisterial decision in the case of a collision betweer the brougham of Lert.Adolphus Vane and a cab, as reported in your paper It appears from evidence that the brougharawas sta. tionary, and that the driver of the cab, though not driving very fast, was driving carelessly, and on the wrong side of the street. This latter fact is alluded to by the magistrate in pronouncing hns dedsion on the case; it is to all aepe ance owving to this fact that the collision occurred, and yet, while it is a matter of notoriety that hadmney carriages in general, and patent safetics in particular, are driven in a mnnner that has frequently been the cause of most deplo. rable accidents, and a case bearing on that subject is fully made out, a magistrate prono6nces a decision which appears to me both unjust to the complainant and probably productive of an impression among c^b-drives that they may with impunity drive on the wrong side of the road, and come into collision with whatever may happen to be in their way. I am, moreover, of opinion that the mnagistrate wfas in error in not considering that the ease wras properly brought forward as mnch on public grounds, on account of the carelessness of most drivers of public conveyances, as with the object of obtaining damages for the injuries done to the carriage of the complainant. Your obedient servant, RAYEHAbL J ttly 24.
EXECUTION A'r ATICEsvgn.-William Brown was executed in front of the county gaol at Leicester at 8 o'clock on Friday morning for tho murder of Edward Woodcock and his grandson at the Thorpe tollgate at Melton 3Mowbray in June last. Since the prisonar's conviction he has paid little or no regard to the ininistrations of the chaplain, but at times he would assume an air of devotion in private, and would offer up an exceedingly well-worded prayer. He protested his innocence to the last, saying he should die a mnartyr, and should soon be in heaven. n order to bring the prisoner to a sense of his awful position he was shown his grave on Thursday, and the only remark he made was, "A h! it's a nice place, aint it? I shall like to lie under the trees." (The grave was dug near to some trees.) His father and several of his friends visited him on Thursday, and he requested the for3uer "to come and see him turned off." The old man secured a seat at a public-house window exactly opposite the drop, occupied it some hours before the execution, and until the fatal hour arrived regaled himself with beer, and was engaged in earnest conversation with his associates. 'The culprit had expressed a wish to be allowed to address the crowd, saying he should speak for an hour. The officials told him he might say what he pleased, and for that purpose he was led out a few minutes before 8 o'clock. His rather recognized him by waving a handkerchief. The prisoner made a low bow, but did not attempt to utter a word, his courage seeming y*having given way. After a maomentary passe, to allow him to speak if he were disposed, CalCraft stepped up to him and quickly adjusted the cap and rope. The bolt was instantly drawn, andthe prisoner, after struggling for several minute, ceased to exist. There ase an imfmene crowd to witness the execution, principally composed of men and bo-ys.

FORIak IN TLLIGENbB. SPAIN. (BY SUBMANThE AN BRTM T=GRAIl.) (A portioin of the following appeared in our second odition of vesterdav -1 - We -have received the following telegtaphic de-. spatch from our Paris correspondent- "PAR. IS, *PltDAV JULY 25, 9 Lsc. 'CAdvices froml Bayonne of the 24th inst. state that, according to a letter from Saragossa dated the 20th inst., General Falcon had held a review of 16,000 men. " A battalion of Royalists, 'which had left Tudela, revolted on arriving near the town and joinied the insurgents. The Custom-house official% did the same. " 15,000 militiamen or. peasants, coming from Quinca, were advancing to join the Arragonese. "The frontier of Navarre is tranquiL" (EMO OUP. OWN CORco SPONDIu-.) PARIS, TWRuSDAY, JuLY 24, 6 Pm. The new Government of Spain seems to have adopted the system of Sartorius with respect to the concealment of news unfavourable to or likely to injare it. From the very fist day of its rule this course has been followed by the Madrid Gozette and by other official organs. Thus it is that we only now begin to know the true details of some of the important events that have occurred since the 14th inst. The contest at Barcelona was represented as trifling, but now turns out to have been extremely severe, and to have lasted during the greater part of four days. The Liberals, after disputing the ground almost inch by inch, were at last driven out of the city, pursued by the cavalry; and at the date of the last advices thence the prisoners taken 'with arms in their hands were about to be shot. Such triunmphs and severity as these are likely to render govarmnent impossible to the victors, and show, at any rate, the aversion of the people from the new rule imposed upon them. From Gerona we learn that General Ruiz, a good officer and determined Liberal, has put himself at the head of the inslurection, supported by the troops under his orders. Fromn private sources details of the destruction at Madrid reach us. One letter says that the palace of Medina Celi (that large, uglymansion, which Ford compares to 10 houses taken from Baker-street) has been so knocked about that there is no telling from its present appearance whether it was a stable or a palace. The house opposite to it, forming the other extremity of the Carrera San Geronimo, and in a line with the Chamber of Deputies, has been equally maltreated. Serrano planted his guns in the Retiro and Prado, and drove out his opponents by main force oI round shot and grape, utterly reckless of the havoc he played in so doing with non-combatanats and their dwellings. The Chamber itself is damaged, and the Deputies were disturbed in their sitting by grapeshot coming through the skylight. O'Donnell and his lieutenants were evidently resolved to win the day at all hazards, ancd even though it were necessa-y to destroy half Madrid. In reward for his achievements, Serrano is made Field-Marshal, and has also, private letters positively affirm, resumed the post of high favour he occupied at Court some nine or ten years ago. On the other hand, O'Donnell is said to be already losing ground with the Queen, who doubtless considers that he has accomplished his task, and thinks about providing him with a successor, who will take a further and longer stride in the path of reaction. We have no further particulars of the outbreak at Murcia, except that it was not a consequence of the changes at Madrid, but a result of the clerical plot the effects of which were first seen atValladolid, Palencia, and Rioseco. Tnis plot had evidently been ably got up, and had wide ramifications. There are fresh reports of disturbances in Galicia and the Castiles, but no positive intelligence on the subject. Butthe general tenour of the accounts shows that Spain is in an extremely unsettled and dangerous state, likely to give O'Donnell (should he remain in power) a vast deal of trouble. It is singular that we can learn nothing positive of whatis going on in Arragon. It is evident that up to this very morning Saragossa, at least, was still unsubmnissive, and, consequently, little or no weight can be attached to recent statements in Spanish and Frenca newspapers, that General Falcon had fled, that his% troops had abandoned him, &c. Of Gurrea, an officer superior to Falcon in talent and energy, we have heard nothing since the ].8th, when he was at Logrono. The Ministerial troops having entered that place, it is clear he must have left it, and has, perhaps, returned to Saragossa. If all Spain besides were tranquil, there wfould be little hope for the Arragonese movement, but as long as we heer of an unsettled state of things in other provinces, of fortified towvns in Catalonia holding out, and until we know the effect produced throughout Spain by the news of such bloody contests as those at Madrid and Barcelona, it were too much to say that all is over, and that Marshal O'Donnell has subdued resistance, andneed have no further uneasiness concerning what he calls the insurrection, and what his adversaries designate as legitimate resistance to an attempt at arbitrary and unconstitutional government. Espartero was still at Madrid at the date of the last advices, and apparently at liberty. It is said that he has been offered a passport to go whithersoever he pleases. If this be true, it is evident that his opponents consider his prestige utterly gone, and that he isrno longer to be feared. Whatever the indecision he may have shown and the errors he may have committed since he was triumphantly borne back to power by the revolution of 1854, it mnst be remembered how long and disinterestedly he has laboured for the good of his country by al the means which, according to his convictions, he could conscientiously and honourably adopt. Ee is now advanced in years, and has long suffered from ill-health, and it is not surprising if he has lost much of that energy and resolution which procured for him in the early part of the civil war the reputation of rashness, but which certainly have never charaeter his conduct as a statesman. The Paris journals, almost without exception, support the union of the Danubian provinces, but the subject excites little interest here at the present moment, although it is likely soon to be a promineirt one, if it be true that the labours of the Bessarabian Boundary Commission and the evacuation of the Principalities by the Austriaus are both to be coMpleted in the course of August. Some persons are of opinion that the Austrians will endeavour to inger in Moldo-Walachia until the Greek question is settled and the country rid of foreign troops but one canhardly suppose that this will be permitted. As there seems to havebeen, owing to the great number of Ghikas, some confusion as to the person who has been appointed Kaimakan of Wallachia, I may mention that it is the same Prince Alexander Ghika who creditably filled the high post of Hospodar of that nrovince from 1834 to 1843. Bis nephew, Constantine, son of that Gregory Ghika who reigned from 1822 to 1828-one of the most tranquil and prosperous periods the Principality has known -was much spoken of at one time as Kairmakan. Both the uncle and the nephew enjoy a high reputation for integrity and patriotism. The Ghikas of Molda'via, one of 'whom, a man much esteemed but tin energy, 'was he late Hospodar, take their nsame from the female line, their real one being Sourondjaroglou. There have been eleven reigning princes of the name of Ghika in WaLlachia snd Moldavia. A letter from Therapia of the 14th, in the Afoniteur, gives some curious details of Marshal Pelissier's sojourn at Constautinodle : " The Sultan, in order to gratify the Msihal, had been graciously pleased to order Mehemed Boy, the intendant of the Pala&e of Top-Kapou, to conduct that officer through the room containing the treasures of the Crown and the different kiosks erected by His Majesti ancestors within the circuit of the Seraglio. On the morning of the 10th the Frenh Ambassador, the Marshal, Vice-Admral Trehouart, and the persons who accompanied them, pro- ceeded in state caeriages to the Seraglio,whereqUehemed B;. had prepared for them a splendid breakfast. They after I wards were conducted to the kiosk of Bsgdad, a most beau. tiful onstrucion, built by Sultan AmunrthlV., and situate ontho highest point of the Seragilo. It is impoesible to behold anything more admirable than this constuction. it is lined inside and oat with slabs of porcelain, known by the ame of '}iachi,' and the finest kind of which w*41for- morly mado at Kuchan, in Persia. All the doors, shutters, aad panels are of cypress-wood, incrusted writh tortoiseshell, ivory, and iother-o'-pearl in beautiful patterls. The ceiling of the cupola is overed ion a ver ohlcour of which iis stl as freshand bright as ever. -then the visitors d sufficiently admired this wonderful construction Mebcemed 3Bey conducted them to tho private treasury of the Sultan. Ulitil of late years the riches accumulated by the Ottoman Sovereigns were deposited in coffers ranged in cellars of Byzantine construction; but in expectation of a vsit from the Emperor of the French the Sultan last ye gave orddrs to have a room prepared and arranged with the objects worthy of being shown to his august ally. The intentionof the Sultan was in.p:rt carried out, and, owing to the exertions of Mehemed Bey, a portion of the wonders which the. Ottoman treasury contains can be viewed by the persons specially permitted to visit them. The vidtor's attention is fist attracted by the throne of Xei-Kaous, Sultan of Koniah- in 1245, which was forrmerly surrounded by hangings embroidered with pearls and emneralds [no* hung up in glass cases. This throne, of solid silvert is covered over with enamelled designs of the greatest beauty, representing the thronesarndornaments of the Kings. of Persia in the olden time. It is surrounded on every side with cloth of gold, and the cushions are of crimson velvet, embroidered with pearls and precious atones. Close to it are to be seen the shield and sabre which Sultan Amurath wore when he made his triumphal entry into Constantinople [after his Peraian expedition. These arms are d4azling with diamonds. By their side'is the precious box which contained the Koran, and which the Sultan Suleyman caried with him during his campaigns. The lid is covered with jewels of price,. among which is a turquoise in the shape of an almond of immense size. To the end of the cord which served to suspend this box is fixed an emerald as large as a hen's egg. In another part of the room are arranged the aigrettes which the Sultans formerly wvore in their turbans on days of ceremony. The emeralds, rubies, and diamonds collected together in these ornaments are of a.size and brilliancy to excite wonder; and it may be safely predicated that Western Europe can boast of few jewels to be compared to those handed down by the ancient Sultans. I will not dwell on the beautiful objects in some other rooms, but nothing can surpass the beauty and exquisite finish of the cups of jade, the arms inlaid with jewels, ancient stuffs stiff with gold and silver, China. vases, and a most curious collection of timepieces of the 17th century, sent as presents from the Sovereigns of Europe. The inspection of the Imperial treasury being terminated, thevisitors were conducted to the library, erected by Sultan Ahmed, which contains a collection of Eastern manuscripts, such as cannot be found elsewhere; and lastly, they visited the old throne-room, the canopy and chimneypiece of which are covered with silver plates, beautifully emnelled and inlaid with agates, garnets, and turquoises. A theatrical performance followed, at the conclusion of which the Marshal and his party proceeded to the Porte, and inspected a body of troops drawn up on the vast esplanade of theSeraskierate. Everywhere the Marshal was the observed of all observers." The Patie publishes the following telegraphic despatch:- "5MARSEILLE, S, JuLY 24.

BERLIN, JuLr 23. In the course of last week Herr von Rochow, -who shot the late President of Police in a duel, commenced his period of imprisonment in the fortress of Magdeburg; the term of that imprisoinment is stated variously to be four and five years. He and his friends had fondly imagined that he would be permitted to undergo the imprisonment in a fortress, only in a nominal sort of manner, and that Stettin would have been selected for him on account of Ms having his own private house there, where he could live in nominal confinement only, as it were "within the rules;" but the reality in this, as in so many other cases, falls lamentably short of the expectation. The choice of the present President of Police, Baron von Zedlitz-Neulirch, which is believed to have been recommended by Herr von Hinkeldey himself in a letter written to the King, in expectation of his own death, proves to have been admirably adapted to close the breach that had already broken out between the noble military and the police. Himself possessed of noble birth, gentlemanly manners, and unblemished antecedents, the present President of Police is one with whom the nobility and military can, consistently with their own views, enter uponi a truce; while his own good sense is leading him to make those alterations in the conatabulary branch of the police which will serve to bring it back to its original character, that of a cvil force for the protection of life and property, and thus, while increasing its usefulness, divest it of the pretensions which led to the late convlict. SARDINIA. (mOx OUR OWV CORRnESPONDEi-T.) TURIN, JULY 21. The lists of the peisons pardoned, or partially pardoned, under the recent Austrian amnesty have now been published in the official Gazette of Milan, and by them it appears that not above a dozen Italians have benefited by this Imperial act of grace. No mention is made of the sequestrated properties in Italy, and, if what I hear from persons wvho ought to be well informed on the subject, be correct, the properties restored to their owners in Hlungary and Transylvania by this vaunted clemency are chiefly those which did not pay the Government for the expense of management, or which have been so devastated under Goverunment administration that they will not pay any one for many years to come. I cannot say that this result has disappointed people in the Lombardo-Veneto kingdom, for they are too much accustomed to such pompous announcements as the telegraph communicated the other day, of "9 a large amnesty," not to understand pretty well beforehand what it is lkely to turn out in practice - but it certainly has rather increased, if possible, their dislike for the reigning family, and they have profited by the occasion of the religious ceremonies, ordered in all the large towns to celebrate the birth of an Archduchess, to show it by abstaining, from all participation in them. I am sorry to say that the news of an assasination of a most audacious character in the Legations has been received in Turin to-day. The victim is M. Tisserand, a French gentleman, who has for some time past acted as Secretary of the French Consulate at Rimini. About 7 o'clock in the evening, on the 15th of this month, he was walking on the public promenade of Rimnini with his wife and daughter, when he was stabbed by a person who ec aped detection at the time, and has not since been heard of. NWo further particulars are given, and no surmise is offered as to the probable cause. Robberies of all kinds, of houses or on the highway, are common occurrences throughout the Pope's dominiors at present. Brigands and beggars seem to assume a prescriptive right to share the fruit of the land with the church, and the claims of the latter have indeed been fully recognized by certain high clerical authorities ; but if the theory of Sydney Smith, that the sacrifice of a bishop would conduce to more careful management of railways in England beat all applicable to the Papal States, it is a hopeful circumstance for people therethat a Cardinal has at length been made a prey of that system of brigandage from which the non-governung classes have so long suffered. It appears that Cardinal Sant-acci left Rome a few days smnce to make his viffegiatura at Rocca Gorga, and that one of his carriages, which followed him, when near Frosinone, was stopped by sL body of aoo 14 or 15 men, who took the horses from the carriage, and sent the coachman to his master to inform him that they should retain the horses (they don't seem to have cared much about the carriage) unless he immediately sent 200 scudi for their ransom. The Cardinal is said to have felt so delighted at having escaped the personal attentions of these bandits that he gladly paid the sum asked for the redemption of his horses, and no doubt if they had found his Eminence in the cariage, they would have exacted a heavy amount of black mail before allowinghim to enjoythe other pleasures of country life in the dominion3 of the Head of the Church. Every day brings out fresh proof of how much importance the most despotic princes attach to public oprnion, however much they may outwardly affiet to despise it. Russia, it is known, devotes large sums in maintaining 3ournals for the diffiusion of her principles. Austria does the same. The church of Rome has advocates among the preo everywhere. And now we hear that the King of Naples, who returned a " don't care" kdnd of answer to the remonstrances of the French and En,lish Goveirnments the other day, has thought it necessary to despatch a Baron Savarese on a journalistic mission to Paris, in order, if possible, to persuade, by whatever arguments he mnay be able to produce, the editors of the leading papers there that the alliance of France-with England is highly detrimental to the interests of the former, and that the peace of Imperial France must be disturbed by this connexion with revolutionary England. The Sardindan representative at the conferenres onthe Danubian Principalities will be the Cavaliere Bens I understnd, who has lately returned fromia Mnissloi to MeiDco.

OIUB GRAVBS IN THB OBIMEA. i (izox o SPZCIAL VOrXAPrnqIM"A The British army, relieved fm the pru of military duties, and warned of their approaching departure, hava laboured, regiment by regiment, for manylongweekl, to erectmemorials to the comra6es whose remains wll be left behind him by the'last Englisniman -who quits this soil; and the works of this nature, which their hasty embarcation did not permit them to complete, have been undertaken by the few skIlledsoldier-labourers now belonging to the 'fragments of the army. The Chersonese is covered with isolated graves; with longer burialgrounds, and detached cemeteries from Balaklava to the verge of the roadstead of Sebasi topol. Ravine and plain-hill and hollow-the roadside and secludea valley-for miles around,from the sea to the Tchernaya, present those stark white stones, singly or in groups, stuck upright in the anid soil, or justpeering over the rank vegetation which springs from beneath them. I have already described Cathcart's-hill Cemetery. The burialgrounds of the Light and Second Divisions have-since attained such dimensions that it would be impossible in a newvspaper to give even an idea of their position, and of the monuments they contain. Without pretending to offer a guide-book, or to notice the many sad. memorials of our losses and sufferings in the Crimea, a brief supplementary notice of some of the principal burialgrounds may not be uninterestinrn. The French haveta'ken but little pains with their graves. One large cemetery has been formed with great care a.nd good tast near the old Inkermann camp, but in general our allies have not enclosed their burial places. The Sardinians have erected a pedestal and obelisk of stone on the heights of Balakiava, close to their hospital, to the memory of their departed comnades, and we have erected similar monuments on the heights of Inkermann and on the plain of Balaklava to commemorate the 5th of Novemler and the 25th of October. These will endure for ages if they are permitted to remain untouched by man. In front of the salient angle of the Redan, at a few yards from the ditch, a handsome white stone obelisk has been put up, with an inscription to the memory of those who fell in the assaults on the place, engraved on one of the square slabs at the Ease. At the Malakahoff there is nothing but a large wooden cross, at the head of a mound full of dead, with this inscription in white paint (sic) "TUnis pour la victoire, DReDu par la mort " Da soldat e'est la gloire "Da brave e'est is sort.,, Oatside the vineyard, at the English headquarters, there is a smaOl graveyard which contains but two monuments. One, formed of a large horizontal slab of marble, marks the spot where lies the body of our excellent Adjutant-Gieneral, and in addition to some R-assian inscriptions has the simple words-" To the memory of Major-General J. Buclmall Estcourt, Adjutant-General of the British army, who died of cholera, June 24, 1855. Born 1802." The next is a handsome cross-" To the memory of C. R. Cattley, Esq., who died of cholera while serving on the staff of Lord Raglan, July 1856." The rest are aUl nameless. In a smrall enclosure, separated from the natural maneadow on the slopes of Inkermann, near the most southerly point of the Russian attack, are three monuments. The centre is a slab of fine white stone lying horizontally on two deep slabs of larger size, so that they form as it were a small flight of steps. It bears a cross at the head and the following inscription :-" 41st Regiment. Sacred to the memory of Lieutenant-Colonel Carpenter, Captain Richards, Lieutenant Swaby, Lieutenant Taylor, Lieutenant Stirling, who fell at the Battle of 3inkermann, November the 5th, 1854; also of A^ssistaAnt-Surgeon I,amont, who died on the 5th of Januaary, 1S55." On the left of this is a horizontal monument of stone, inscribed-" Sacred to the memory of Sergeant-Major Spence, 41st Regiment, who was killed at the Battle of Inkermaun, on the 5th of November, 1854, aged 28 years ;" and on the rigght is a smaller slab " Sacred to the memory of J. Lilies, private, 41st Regiment, who was killed at the Battle of Ilnkerman." There axe many other graves scattered up and down over the slope of the hill, and a large enclosure is devoted almost exclusively to the 30th Regiment. In leaving the Inkermau polateau, and proceeding down the Woronzow-road past the burialground of the Lig't Division, you come on the rear of Gordon's battery. Here Ama ny a poor fellow has been brought to die, and then has found a resting-place near the scene of his last fight. Over one mound there is a stone, " Sacred to the memory of E. Churchill and W. Lattiman, killedl 17th October, an2 of J. Radnore, killed 18th June, of E.lS. Diamond." Further on, behind the first parallel, there is a monument, " Sacred to the memory of Sergeant R. WCoy, H^.M. 55th Regiment, who fell in the assault on the Quarr^ies on the eveningt of. the 7th June. Erected by his affectionate brother, John M'Coy, Colour Sergeant, 49th Regiment." T is an affecting proof of brotherly love, but somewhat further on two soldiers have given a stillmore conspicuous proof of the same feeling. In front of the third parallel, and just in rear of the Quarries, there is a very handsome stone slab, surrounded with a fine wall of cut stone. The slab is richly ornamented and carved, and bears the following inscription :-" Erected by William and James Weir, 47th Reginent, to the memory of their beloved brother Robert, who was killed in the trenches before Sebastopol on the 12th of July, 1855, aged 31. Also to Sergeant J. Keefe of the same regiment, who was killed at the same time and place.-' Blessed are the servants whom the Lord when he comes shall find watchine.-Luke 12." In a secluded ravine, once busy with frequent marches and resounding with the roar of cannon, the bursting of shells, and the turmoil of the neighbouring camps, lie all that was mortal of those of the Naval Brigade who rest in the Crimea. The cemetery is enclosed by a wall, and is entered by a gateway, in good preservation. The first stone which strikes the eye is a handsome vertical slab of marble, with a cross engraved, and the inscriptions, "Requiescatin pace. Sacred to the memory of Lieutenant E. H. Hughes D'Aeth, late First Lieutenant of Her Majesty's ship Sidon, who, after having served nine months on shore with the 3Naval Brigade, died of cholera August- 7, 1855, aged 34 years. This stone is erected by t~he can)tai'n and offlcers of HIer MaJesty's ship Sidon in testimony of their esteem and regard." The second grave is inscribed, " Sacred to the memory of -. Nichols, who was kldled in action on the 5th of September, 1855, aged 24. 'U nto the Lord I lift up my souL"' The third is a simple memoril "' To the memory of William Barry, killed 17th, 1855.

"But onice again we will set sail our Admiral Christ to meet." In the north-west angle of the enclosure are four graves without stones. In the second row are 17 graves, of which eight are marlked by headstones. In the third row there are 13 graves, t-vo of which. have slabs and inscriptions to the memory of seamen, named Coin and Hughes. The third grave is dis-. tinguished by a iine slab-"To the memory of LieutenantW. H. Douglas R.N.,Her Mjeslty'sShip Queen ; klled 11th Aprilwbie serving in the battery with the Royal.Neval Brigade atthe s-eg ofSebastopol.' Next is a flinemonument-"Sacreato the menory of ieutenant S.

On the 6th row there are 13 graves, of which only one is provided with any memorial, aud this one is a large dlab of wood already decaying and inscribed as fo1l0ws:-" Sacred to the memory of the followirg seamen of Her Majesty's ship Queen, serving in the Naval Brigade before Sebastopol-George Sullivan, E. Eames, R. Ladrick, W. Good, J. Morrows, J. Duggan, J. Davison, F. M. Collier, W. Soulsby, J. Trim, J. Bryant, N. Harvey,W. Jones, B. Taylor, E. Hill, W. M'Donald, F. Eddy, J. Symons. H. J. Bazing, J. Corbally, '. Phillips, S. Welsh, J. Blewitt, J. Medlin, J. Coffin, Pat Mahoney, R. Johns, T. Lanahan, T. Clark, H. Chester, and F. Driver." In ihe seventh row are 14 graves. No. 1, a wooden slab. "Sacred to the memory of J. Price, J. Reed, WV. Davidson, and E. Quinn, who feUl in action in the execution of their duty on the 18th of June; also, of J. Murphy, J. Ennis, and MichaelRKtans, who fel in the stormig party the same clay, much lamented by their shipmates of Her M'dajesty's ship Rodney." No. 2 is a large wooden slab--" Sacred to the memory of J. Glanville, kdiled 9th of April, aged 28; S. Turner, lilled in action April 11th, aged 25 J. Woodford, killed in action 14th of April; D. Logai,illed in action 6th of June; J. Lane, W. WhCeler, R. Morris, J. Calinane, J. Brooks, J. Swift, T. Short, Fulerton P. Donaghue. This board is erected by the ship's company of Her Majesty's ship Wasp, in token of respect to their departed shipmates." The grass grows green over these graves, and numberless wild flowers have sprung up in the rich mould of the ravine. The enclosure is but a short way from the site of the camp of the Naval Brigade, but it is situated on the left-hand side of the ravine as you descend towards Sebastopol, whereas the sailors pitched their tents on the right-hand side. By the side of the road from Balaklava to the front there are two graveyards filled with slabs and with monuments in cut stone, one erected by the Army Works Corps to their own officers and men who died here; the other, the work oF the same corps> in memory of the officers and men of the Land Transport Corps who fell by sickneIs in t1he Crimea. In the plain below the site of the Turkish camp, near head-quarters, stands a solitary grave. It is enclosed by a substantial stone wall, and the head is marked by a handsome slab of oolite, or white sandstone, with an ornamental carving above an incised cross. On the body of the stone is engraved" Sacred to the memory of Colonel Balfour Ogilvy, who died July 12th, 1855.-This stone was erected as a mark of respect by his brother officers." Such isolated records are nIot uncommon. Poor Ogilvy ! I travelled with him to the East when he came out in February, 1854, to sesk service in the Turkish army under his friend Colonel Cannon, and I soon heard of his distinguishing himself at SiMistria, and subsequently of hia gallant behaviour ait Eupatoria. While the Turkish army was lying miactively on the hills near Lord Rag-lan's quarters he sickened and died just at the very time that Omar IPasha had triumphed over the scruples and objections of the allied generals to the removal of his troops to Kutais. The burialground of the non-commissioned officers and men of the Brigade of Guards. is enclosed by a substantial walL It is entered by a handsome double gate, ingeniously constructed of wood, and iron hoops hammered out straight, and paintei, which is hinged on two massive piliars of cut stone, with ornamental capitals, each surmounted by a cannon balL There are six rows of graves, each row containing 30 or more bodies. Over each of these is either a tombstone or amound, fenced in byrowvs of white stones with the iitials or sometimes the name of him who lies below, mrarked on the mouldcby means of pebbles. Facing the gate, and close to it stands a large stone cross, erected ona series of four massive blocks of the same material. On the west face of the block supporting the cross are the words" Grenadiers, Coldstreams, Scots Fusileer Guards, A.D). 1856.' On the opposite face is the following inscription-" To the memory of the noncommissioned officers and men of the brigade of Guards who fell in the Crimea this cross was erected by their surviving comrades, ALD. 1856." There are but few monnmental stonfes in this cemetery; one is a stone cross, withthe inscriDtion, " Sacred to the memory of Lieutenant A. Hill, 22d Iegiment, who died June 21, 1855. This stone was erected by his friends in the Crimea." Another is "In memory of Sergeant-Major Rennie, 93d Highlanders. Erected by a friend." A third is " Sacred to the memory of Sergeant George Mancor. Erected by a friend." A fourth is to " Quartermaster J. 'Donald, 72d Rege,iment, who died, on the 16th of September, from a wound received in the trenches before Sebastopol on the 8th of September, aged 35 years."
| IBITION qf ART TREAsuR.s, MAzVcHEsTEA I IK-)~~~~187. The following ciruiar has just been issued by the executive committee, and is signed by Mr. T. Fairbairn, the chainran : "I respectflflly invite your attention lo the character and objects of ths hibitior. of Art Treesures which wil take place in Manchester im l8g7, and solicit your aid in rendering its a tract ens worthy of onr national wealth in. every department of att. " Jnbl ia this respect to the colleetior.s of continental nations, the treasures of the uited kngdom are for the most part dispersed in the hands of private collectors and patrons of art; and, however grat the liberality of their possessors, it is inevitable that many of the choicest works must romain unknown to the vast majority of even the educated classes of society. Our design is to exhibit in one building not only examples of the chief vork-s of al the great masters of painting and sculpture, both of the ancient and modern schools, butspecimens of artistie excellence or of antiquarian interest, illustrative of the leaKs and present state of art in every quarter of the world *;and wFe contemp]ate the compilation of a catalogule which will leave a permanaent record, nsef alike to the artist and to the tron of art, and interesting to every observer of the intellectusl progress and refinement of nations. proIt is obvious that scob a design can only be worthily accomplished by the generous co-operation of all who have the means, at a temporary personal sacrifice, of affording s grtification of the highest and purest nature to many thonsands of their fellow-countrymen. "We have already received liberal pronmises of support, and I have the honourto enclose a copy of a letter nddressed to the Earl of Ellesmere, the president of our association, by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, evincig a cordial interest in the success of this unde g, and enforcing by arguments that command an immediate assent the course by which alone that result can be secvuedL " It is for no merely local objects that this enterprise is commenced; but, with an earnest desire to contribute to the elevation of the national taste and the mental cultivation of the people, the city of ;ennchester is prepared toperform her part by providing all the means for conducting an 'Exhibition of Art 'Treasure on a scae hitherto uoattempted in this kngdom; and the committee appeal with confidence to yourself and to the public generally fo encouragement and support in the arduous tak mposed upon them.

The latest news from Spailn ndicating. that he Government nsay-yet have to encounter a protisted a.truggle with the Constittitionalists likewiO tendedl to create heaviness. The transactions of theday were extremely limited, and there is scarcely any speculation. Bank Stock left off at 21 *to-21T7f Reduced, 96G to 3;New Three per Cents,, 96j to ; Annuities, 18 3-16; Consol Scrip, 4, to i pm.; Indis Stock, 233 to 236; India-bonds, 21s. to 24s. pm.; E3xchequer-bonds, 100 to -i; and Exchequer-bills, 20a to 24s. pm. Foreign securities were finn at the commencement of business, but they subsequently exhibited some heaviness Spanish and Venezuela showed a decline towards the close. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were dealt in at I04s i, and J, and the Four per Cent. Guaranteed for the account at i0&. The general business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 1024; Danish Five per Cents., 105 i Granada New-Active, 20'; Defer-ed, 7i; Peruvian Fourand-a-HaMf per Cents., for account, 811; Portuguese Five per Cents., 64; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 981 and 99 ; Sardinian FiveperiCents., 92i; Spanish Three per Cents., 45 and 44 ; the New Deferred, for account, 24, 23k, and A; Venezuela, for account, 34, 33k, and ;; the Deferred, 14 ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97-., In -the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was -no alteration of importance from the rates of last post. The corn-market was heavy this morning, owing to large arrivals, and sales cuuld not have been pcessed except at a decEine of 2s. The report of the Liverpool cotton.market for the week shows a steady busmness at former rates. The final quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening failed to arrive, butf the opening transacions inl the Three per Cents, for the end of the month were at 70f. 60c., showing a fall of * per Cent. The private letters from Paris state that the recent demand of the Bank of France upon its customers for a reduction or repayment of all advances on stocks and shares had operated sti further to check any tendency to revival on the Bourse. The absence from Paris of most of the leading operators, usual at this season, also increased the prevailing dulness, and the last intelligence from Spain has caused considerable disquiet, by diminishing the confidence previously entertained in the complete and immediate success of the reactionary movement. The rate of exchange at St. Petersburg has not yet reached a point at which gold can be sent thither at a profit, but bills on that capital have lately been scarce, arnd sOme half-imperials are being remitted. The pressure in the Hamburg money-market continues to diminish, and the rate of discrunt has declined to 5 per cent. At the same time, the exchange on London presents a more favourable appearance. At a meeting of Venezuelan bondholders held this afternoon, Tr. D. Powles presiding, the report of the Spanish American Conmittee (an abstract of which has appeared in 7te Timts) was brought under consideration. The result of the discussion was the rejecion of the proposal made by the special commiissioners, Messrs. Corvaf a-ad Pardo, on,t'ne 27th of June, as wholly inladequate. Their later communication, dated the 24th of July, appeared to meet the approval of a number of the bondholders, and, since the suggestions contained therein have been laid before Lord Clarendon, it is thoughtthey may bew orty of further consideration. Although the commnissioners profess to be without authority to embody the terms stated in a definite arrangemtent they seem inclined to believe that their GEovenmnent will consent to an adjustment on this modified basis. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs having agreed to give Mr. Corvaia an interview on the question to-morrow, an adjournment for a fortnight was carried, with the view of ascertaining if any further progresS can meanwhile be made in arrivng at a settlement. The proceedings occupied between two and three hours, and were characterized by much personal and acrimonious argument. The Plantagenet has arrived' from Sydney, but the amount of gold she brings, if any, remains to be ascertained. At the Court of Bankraptcy to-day an adjudication of the petition against Mr. S. Adams, of the fertford and Ware Bank, took place. The estate will be administered before Lr. Commissioner Fane. In the colonial produce markets during the week there has been a fair amount of business, 'and prices are in some instances higher. The demand for sugar at the commencement was inactive, and, although the quantities offered and declared for sale were unusually small, no inclination to operate was manifested, pending the Dutch Trading Company's summer sales of 91,000 baskets of Java. These, however, passed off with much animation at an enhancement of about 2s. per cwt. on the valuations. The news of that fact immediately caused a renewal of buoyancy here, and the only parcel offered at public sale (Mauridius) was readily taken, and rates are now fully 6d. to ls. per C-wt. above those of last week. Lately, by private treaty, five cargoes of lavannak have beera disposed of, one of unclayed flanilla; and one of Bahia, as well as a floating parcel fi native Madras, all at high terms. On th spot likewise contracts of some irnportance have been completed, and the market closes with much firmness. The first oe the new crop of Costa Rica coffee was offered this week; and, although very large quantities of this and of plantation Ceylon were brought forward, the whole realized high prices, except at to-day's sales, when the rates previously obtainable for the former classes were not fully maintained. A portion of a cargo of St. Domingo has been sold for Hamburg, whither the ship goes direct. The rice markets have been very quiet, andrathor lower rateshave been accepted. Saltpetre also is less inq,uired for. In tea theTe has been scarcely any busmess. A few of the green descriptions have been sold at full rates; but for some ot black a slight decline has been submitted to. Rum still continues in very good request, and full to advanced rates have been paid. The first vessel of the new steam line between london and Canada sailed yesterday with a full and' valuable cargo. The next will follow on the 9th of August. An erroneous impression is represented to have been created that the Commerecal Docks at the present time are crowded with shipping, and unable to receive more. It is stated in correction that there is room for an almost indefinite number of ships and their cargoes, including the largest clss.

NORTH STAFFORDSniRB. The report of the directors of this company state3 that t,he claixms outstanding against the London and NorthWestern Company amount to 62,9041. In respect to thelavw proceedings now pending between the two companies. the report'states that i is the determination of this company to. obtain the judgmentof the Court at the earliest possible period. The net profit shown by'the returtis of the traffic on the railway ana canal exceeds that of the corresponding half-year of 1855 by 25,5561., being 93,7621. for the sass half-year against 68,2061. at thd corresponding penrio of 1855, showing an increase on the railway of 9,5991., and on thecaial of 15,9571., togethbr about 374 per cent. The available net receipts for the past half-year (independently of claims outstanding against the London and North-Western Company). amount to 50,1501. The directors are, tberefore, enabled to recommend a dividend at the rate of 3A per cent. per annumj, or I Gs. lad, per share, amounting to 49,4E11. It is considered by the roard no longer, necessary to hesitate in availing themselves of the borrowing powers of the company for the purpose of bringing upon the ve the vast mineral traffic of -he Biddulph coalfield. In compliance with a demand of the trustees of the Bridgewater CanAl under the agreement entered into by the company for the lease of their undertaking, it was found necessary to abandon the bills for the prosecution of which, in thelast session of 1'alianient, every preparation bad been made... The. independent outlet at Liverpool which these bills had for their especial ohject has been fully attained by the arrangement for the transfer oftthe Bridgewater property. It has been thought advisable to obtain the sanction of Parlianment in the next session to the tralisfer, with a view of avoiding legal expenses, which may probably be altogether unnecessary. The total amount of capital authorized by the acts relating to the company, including 1,170 0(01 for the canal, is,5,S20,00O1.-of which the sum of 695,38i.remains to be raised on shares andloans; The capital acount to the 30th of June shows that' 3,959,726l. had been rased for the railway nd 3,975,9W. expanded, leaving a balance against the compiny of 16,2171. .The railway revenue for the half-year ending the 30th of" June shows that 107,6144 had been rebeived and 56,9521.- expended, leaving a balance of 5K6M9I. The canal traffid for t% hlalf-year amounlted to 7.2;9521. and the expenses toD. '29,891.; leaving a hbalaiace of 43,0691. The sneral revenue account shows that the balance due to the corapany is equal to 2 per cent., now in suspense, for the yeaw 1'si, and to 4 per cent. for the past half-year on the ordinary stock of the company.

cAT'TLE-DBrXXG IlAt TH1E STREETS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Ia your report of the proceedings of the Court of Common Council of the city of London to-day. with refezonce to the driving of cattle through the streets, a member oflthe Couneil is reported to have asked whetJer the by-laws were not sufficiently stringent to. prevent the cattle from being driven through the public streets between midnight on Saturday and mnidnight on Sumday. -In amswer, Mr. H. L. Taylor stated, with satisfaction, " that there is a local act in th3e parish of Islington which, if only put into operation, woud obviate all the evils resulting from cattle being driven through the public streets on the Sabbath-div." As I represent the local authority of 1hdington, I feel bound toS-et this matter right, aud I am sure lfr. Taylor, wlo is the chairman of the Markets Committee, could not have had the Isliogton locad act before him when he made that statement. The local act is the 5th George IV., cbp. 125. The section referred to is the 111th, by w7hich it is enacted, "that if any drover, or other person, shaU conduct, ordrive in, tLpon, or through any of the roads, &c., within'this waish, any oxen: sheep, swine,' or other cattle, on any Sanday. between -the hours of 11 of the clock in the forenoon, and 4 of the clock in the afternoon, he shall for. e.very such ofence forfeit and pay the sum of AOs., to bh recovered bofore any justice of thc peace for the county." This' certainly does not extend from midnight on Saturday to midnirht on Sunday. I believt it was intended-bythe bylaws. of the Mxrkrts Cominittee-to give proteationcover the *holc of Sanday; hit thbe 15th bj -w-prepared for that nurpose-cs!6bidusly defecttre; it is-as follows :-' -. - 4' To prevent :thef&ese"raiion of the Lora's-day by the driving of cat.le, jit is ordered-that, from and afterthe aaidmarket shall be opened,n6 cattle, sheep, or swine shall on any part of ou:v :3nnday be dzriven to or from the Metropobitan Cattleiniahdrt4 through or along any,street or.road *h the mietropolitan,pjolce district,.ivithin a circumference the- rCouics Vt which shall boe seven-miles from -St. -Paurds Cathedral, and if any.person fromand after the opening of the said unark-et shall, on -ny part of any Sunday, drive any ond or amore hasd of cattle; sheen, or swine to or from the saul martket throuigh or aIohg ang3 street or road iai the metropblitam police district within a circumference the redeus ofi -vvuch is seven l}illes in a straight line froin St. Jaul s Cathedrie.- in the city of .-London, he shall for every such oftence forÃ¯Â¿Â½eit and pay any sum not eio6dia*. five pounds." The Tily prohibition on the Snnday in the Islington Act. is duAiug&five hours of ths.t day, but the great defect in the corporation by-lav-is: that the only prohibition is " to or froii t-he sletcbpolitan Cattle-market ;" the consequence is that on the Sunday,the cattle are driven to or from the differen, lai-s in tbe parish, instead of "'to or from the Merololitah 7Cattl -,mar'it; " - tlid g'r'eat annoyanoe au& terror- of-the inhabctaitsjirhich -are especiallincreased biy the droVbsofforeign cattle justreleased froim the vessels on the SundaV. . . t - .- T - I ' .

The Rev. J. C. Bua, LLD., then delivered an address on the dvantagessaccruing frdm the study of archseology, in which he madethe following remasiks as to the lessons swhich niight have been derived frora Roman antiouities as - to the conduct of the recent war:-If an one haa said to the Pzinmq Minister of England, when 'he declared war against Russia, "MyLord, let me advise you, before yout take a single step in the proiecution of this momentous en.- terprise, -to spend at'least onie week in the study of Roman antinuities," what -would have been thought of him ! And whai would b-ave been thought of the Minister who, in 'a time of such pressing emergency, should fossake the Cabinet Council, neglect his detpatches, and leave corriers and clerks to stare st one another hile he toolk a run down to the north to examine walls of Hadrian aud Antozinus !'. What would have been -thoughtof him ? And yet if ire look into-it the suggestion is not so supremely ridiculous as at irst 'ght it appears. Supposing Lord Aberdeen had come into WNbrthumberand, and had placei himself under the guidance of our local society, -what couldwe hAve showvn hin there that would have aided 1im in directinX the marlike energies of this great nation7 The first thing, probably, thatt we -should have done would have been to show, him the Watling-street or some of the other lines of lRoman road which there exisi in a state of odnsiderable perfection. Afterwe had wAlked his Lordship for some miles overthe stones that had been laid in their present bed nearly 1,.00 years ago, we should have said to him, " Youn here thepractice of the Romans. In advancing upon an onemy they umforxily made the construction of a road keep withthe progress of the army. This 1hey did, not from cowardly motives, but in order-to keep up the communicafion -with their reserves in the rear, that their supplies might be duly forvrarded; ania that in the case of sudden disaster they mightmake good their retreat. Here you sse how Agricola acted when, 1D theyesr80, he marched against the Caledonjans. He made roads. BD sure that in direc -' ing the energies of the moaern Caledonizns ogainst tho Russians you impress upon them the necesaty of makicf roads. Let this be one of -the ist things to be attended to. Unfortunately, however, the Prime Minister of that da- ' was too busy to study antiquities. It was not until after our. army had suffered the severest calamities thst a road was made from Balaklava to the camap. Again, we should probsbly after tthis have taken him to some of our Roman stations on the wall, and shown him the care with which a Roman army intrenched itself wrhen it xested even for a night. - At Borcovicus we would have furrished him with proofs for believing that when. the army sat down there to bu5ld'the wall the first thing they did vas to erect the thick stono walls of their own camp, and to rear the stone barrisks which were to formn their own habititions. We should have confirmed this opion by referring him to the sculptures on TErajan's Columu, which represent the soldiers employed in the Dacian campaign as oescz very extenaysly employed in building stone dwlhings. ~W"e should then have pressed upon his Lordship the necessity of securing strong and wa.m habitations for t.he army the moment that they had reached the ground which they were to occupy even for a moderate length of time. But vhat is the use of studying antiquities? vhat is the use of profiting by the experience of past ages? So at least some bave thought, for, though the frames of our soldiery are not more hardy than were those of the Romnans, they, were exposed On the heights of *ebastopol in a way that a Roman army never would have been. Further, -we should probably have drawn his attention -very particularly to the Roman method of heating t.heir apartments boy hypocausts; and we shoufld have suggested to him the adoption of a similar method of enabling tlso army to endurse the rigours of a Crimean winter. When fuel is scarce, -what more effectal or economical way cam be employed than by mkng -he heated air toass beneath the 'loors of the rooms? One sma'l fire v in this way heat whole suitesof apartments. But there was not timne to study antiquities- anid ou3r army was left to bear up against the rigors of winter asbeet they could. As to the commiurearsat of the Roman army, our stations on the 1ines of Hadrisn and Antoninus do not teac-h us mucb, hut the instructive coil around the column of Trajan mxale i up for the deficiency. We should have called his Lordship's attention to the important fact that foremost iu the prepations-wlhich Trajan is there represented as maldng for his campaign in I)acis is laying in astore of bay forhishorses. There the haystacks stand to this day. Doubtless, if the horses vere cared for, the men would not be neglected. Wo should have said to him, " My Lord, let your commisasiat. be complete to thr rnostumportant article-be sure that you have hay for your hloris." But no; our ralers had not time to throw away 'upon the study of autiquities, Ansj Our noble horses were left on the heights of Sebastopol at a temperature not, much above zero, to eat one another's xnanes -hnd tails. Perhaps by this tiine it will appear that the idea of even a Prime Minister paying a little attention to antiquities is not very absurd. If the evils to which I have ,referred had been avoided by the adoption of the experience of :the Romans, as taug'nt us by the monuments which they -have left us, half n-yeares income-tan would. hav'e been saved to this country, and this sarely even utilitaiias-wllT consider as a thing of real importsnce. Mr; 0. IroNgs then made some remark;s on the present, as compsred with the recent, state of arch'eological study. I Th*is were awarded to the lecturers, and the meeting separated. - I The temporary museum was then opened in the National Galleiy', containimg a great variety of rare and interesting Jaxtiqiaties illustrative of the history and manners of the anScottish people i bygone ages.

TBX WATERLOO SlTuIO2V OF THE SOUTHWE;STERN RAILWAY. TO THE EDrIrO OF THE T3IMES. Sir,-I constantly have occision to travel on the SovthWestern Raiiway.

WRITS OF ERROR. EOrJSR OF TilRThR T-r o., T_ EURL OF ZMOUNTCASHELL V. VISCOU'.NT O'NTRT- 'T=rwas a writ -F error, brought to reverse a judgment of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Ireland reversing the jludgment of the Court oi Queen's Bench so far asit was favourable to the plaintiff, and affirm- ing it so far as it was favourable to the defendant. The facts of the case were fully reported in The Y2ines on the 18th of this mortth. The LOuD CHAssCcLLOP, in giving judgment in this case, said, that the question arose out of an action of trover brought by the plaintiff against the late Viscount ONeill to recover the value of certain trees which the latter had cut down and converted to his own use. The question turned entirelr ne o the construction to be put upon the 23d and 24th of George IIL, chap. 39, which was an act for the encouragement of the planting of timber trees in Ireland. There had been eight plantings in all, and the obections raised to the seven last plantings was that the afdavit required by the statute had been made by the agent of the tenant instead of by the tenant himself. The objection to the first planting was that the affidavit related to two denominations of land, held under the same landlord, but that it did not specify the number of trees planted upon each. The last objection related to the third planting- and was that the affidavit related to two denominations of land, held under different landlords, without distinguishing the trees planted upon each. As to the fist and third plantings the Court of Qaeen's Bench had decided in favour of the plaintiff, and had beld the remaining affidavits to be sufficient under the statute. The Court of Exchequer Chamber had reversed the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench in so far as it was in favour of the plaintiff, and had Oiven a general judgment for the defendant. That judgment had been appealed against, and the case had been argned at the bar of the mouse, the lemrned judges being in attendance. The learned judges an answer to questions put to them by their loraships, held that as regarded the third planting the affidait -was not sufficient, but that the other affidavits were such as satisfied the meaning of the statute. Under these circumstances, he should move that their Lordships should affirm thejudgment of the Court below, except as to the third planting, which must be decided in favour of the plaintiff. Judgment accordingly.

It was necessary. to teach parties who thus parted with! their property that the practice could not be pursued with impunity. The bankrupt would only receive a third-class cerbificate, after. three years' suseiension, without protection, and, if put in !prison, he would not be released until the expiration of one year., On the application of Mr. LInKLATRn, unopposed by r.~ WAlxE% for the assignees, a certificate of tne first-cUss was granted to H.

This was a penal action, sn which the plaintiff sought to recover two penalties of 20l. each from the defendant, who is the clerk to certain justices, for having illegally exacted fees to a greater amount than he was authorized to have and demand. It appeared thatyth plaintiff having been brought up before a magistrate, at the petty-sessions, at Bucking, with another man, on the charge of sheep-steraling the mrtstrateo who was not at that tne hasistedtby the clerk, Mr. Blythe, remanded, the prisoners to the next sessions, at Snettisham, when they were finally committed for trial; on each occasion they were alowed to remain at largoe on entering into their personal recognizances and giving hail, and the questions raised by the two counts of the declaration were whsether the defendant had on those occasions illegally exacted three recognizances and charged the fees applicable to as many recogaizances, ndwhether the table of fees under which he cdaimed to act had been legaly promulgated withi the provisions of the statnte in that care made and provided. as to the lateer point, it appeared that while the statute provided that the table should be pred by the magistrates of the county at one sessions and confirmed at the next, and then rerented to the judges of assize for approval atrthe next gauizes, the fact vas that the consideration oft*he table had bean adjourned from one session to another. It was contended that this departure from the strict letter of the act adovitiated the table, and also, that if valid, it only allow.ed the justices' clerk to exsct two fees-viz., for the recognizance of the party and one surety, and fortwo notices. The defendant, on the-other hand, claimed the right to exact Lees in respect of each surety, thongh many might be inserted in each recognizance. On these legal questions the leirned judge reserved a point for the ourt aboven and at the request of the learned sarneant took the opinion of the jury on two questions of fact, the first being whether the magistrates had in fact ordered two suret.es at theking, and next whether he did so or no, whether the defendant, who had acted on memoranda of what tad taken plae in his absence, bad exacted the double recognizances and fees thereon under the bon atpe belief that theyv had been ordered. The jury, after evidence had been given on these questions, found that one recognizance alone had been ordered by the magistrate, but that the defendant had acted bondi thode in exacting the recognizances and fees. Uinder these circumstances the -ahesr JUsnlCi ordered n verdict to be entered for the plaintiff for 40o., subject to the points reserved. . ISODLEY V. DStEWE1;I.

Unlike the last. however, the characterof the plaintiffecame out of the ordeal of love as pure as it was when the defendant' first addressed her and won her affections. The plaintiff's family live at Ya-mouth, and the defendant is the master of a ship trading at tr,at pOrt. Just before be quitted Yarmouth ensa voyage -to Triest5, which was expected to be of some duration, he formally offered and was accepted. In the Channel his yesse came mto. collision with another, and he put into Falbnouth, wbence he wrote to the plaintiff a loving epistle, calling on himself sundry impassioned denunciations if he sbould ever love another. A sailor, however, they say, has i wife at every port, and while the good ship was in the Ahipwright's hands the idle captain came into collision with a fair widow, who, as the learned serjeant said, had three children in one scale and lots of money in another, He Eoon forgot his vows at Yarmouath, and in three short months from bis offer he wrote to the plaintiff excusing him- self from further correspondence "as it would now ba sinful," and thenr it was discovered that he was engaged to the'widow. . The defendant wss not represented by counsel, and ths jury, without much-hesitation, returned a verdict for the plaintiff with lOL. damages.
HOTf ClTRCTTIT AJIDSTONE, JULY 24. CROWN COURT.-(Beforc Mr. Justice ERLn-) Hannah Adams, 40, a respectable-looking woman, was indicted for the capital ofTence of feloniously cutting andl wounding Alfred James Adams with intent to murder him. hlr. Denman prosecuted; xr. Russell was counselfor the prisoner. Mr. DEFcLALtZ, in opening the case, said that the prisoner was charged with a very serious offence, that of endeavouring to commit the crime of murder upon her own child, and the evidence would leave no doubt that she had irnficted a most danigerous wound upon the neck of an infant three months old. lIe Was bound, however, to admit that the circumstances under which the act was committed were of such a character as fairly to raise a doubt whether the pnisoner was in such a state of mnind at the tirme as would render her legally responsible; and if thejury shouldthink that she was not capable of distinguishing between right and wrong when she inflicted the injury upon her child, they would be justified in aequitting her on the ground of insanity. Mr. G. Leney, surgeon, of Maidstone, deposed that he knew the prisoner. She was a roarried woman, and he had been in the habit for several years of attending her and her family, and he did so upon the occasion of the birth of the child in question, in March last. On the morning of the 11 th of June he was sent for to the prisoner's hons, and he found her and her husband in the back room, and the child was in the cradle, and he saw there was blood uaon it, and inquired what was the ma^tter. The prisoner's hb-sband told him that she had beeni endeavonring to kdll the child. The prisoner was at this' time sittingina chair, cr*ng. He examined the 'child, and founda very severe woend on the back of the neck. It was a very dangeroas wound indeed for a child of such an age, andit appeared to bave been inflicted by a carvingknife that was shown to him, and which was bloody. The child had since quite recovered. He asked the prisoner what could have induced her to commit such an act, and she said that she had had an intention to do it for a fortnight, and that for three or four nights she had been unable to sleep in consequence of thinking about it; and at last she had done it. Be then asked her if she was not sorry, or if she woald ever attempt to do such a thing again, and she replied that she would not do'such a thing again for the world; and sbe asked him to give her in charge to the police or get her into some asylum, or else she should destroy herself. Witness told her that he should take precautions against that, and sent for .AMr. Blundel), the superintendent of police, and gave the prisoner into custody. During the conversation le haed with the prisoner, sbe told him that she had felt the same desire to destroy another child she had had eight or ten years before, and she wished to be ' put away" somewhere. The health of the prisoner was deranged at this time, and hle bad no doubt that she was suffering under some morbid action of the brain at the time she committed the act of which she was accused. in answer to questions put by the learned JUDG., the witness stated that the prisoner was a quiet, barmless woman 'in general, and appeared to be ver fond of her children. -Mr. Justice BRLE then observed that he thought, after this evidence, the jury would not have any difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the prisoner was not criminaUy responsible for the act uroved against her, on aocount ,of the state of her mind. If, however, they deirbalto hear any further evidence the case should go ou. ! The Jury said they were perfeetly satisfied with the evidonce already before them; and they accordingly returned avefdict of Aot Guilty, on the ground.of insamty.

The depositions taken zt the last examination were read over and signed, and the prisoner, who denied that he had asked forany money, and said he simply called at the counting-house to solicit for advertisements, was coimmitted for tniaL~ - patfick Madden, a young man who has been several times ir! custody for sealing and attepting to steal, was charged with pretending to he in a fit while some of his companions robbedja young man, who went* to his assistance, of his watch. RI IL Temple, assistant to Messrs. Phillips, teadealers of King 'Villiani-street, said, that just as the premises of his employers were about to be closed he saw the prisoner at the corner ef Abchurch.lane lying on the ground, apparently in a violent fit. ie went to his assistance, and while in the act of raising him discovered his guard hanging loose and 'his watch gone. He had no doubt whitever that some of the prisoner's companions stole his watch. T. Smart, tLonstable No. 411, said,-Seeing a mob collected at the corner of Abchurch-lane I -went there, and found the prisoner apparently in a fit. On learning that the prosecutor had lost his watch I toolk the prisoner into custody, feeling convinced that it was only a sham fit. Prisoner.-It was not a sham fit. It was a regular rial 'one. (Laughter.) .Smart.-'When I took the prisoner into custody he saidi "-I know nothing about the matter ," nothing * aving.hen, sald about tlslbNss of tfie *atch,~ except dsiiig the time he w.as in the shsam fit. W. Hall, constable, No. 280.-1 had the prisoner in custody on the 5th of May last, upon a charge of pickdng a lady's pocket in 'olborn. The evidence was not sufficiently strong on that occasion to convict him. le then threw hunself in a fit. I have known him a long time. le belongs to a regular gang of thieves. J. Dickens, junior, clerk at Messrs. Phillips's, said, he saw the prisoner loitering abont the shop door for at least ten minutes before he went down in a fit. He (witness) at first thought him very bad, and fetched him some water. Partridge, the gaoler, said.-I have seen the prisoner in custody more than once on the felons' side of Giltspur-street Cqmpter. I also saw him in Fore-street a fewv hours before he had this fit in ccmpany with three other notorious thieves. Smart-The books of the prison itave been searched, and they contain no entry of the prisoner having had a fit while he was confined there. Other evidence was given of the antecedents of the prisoner, -who, after protesting his innocence, was committed to prison for two months with hard Is.bour. James haynard, a savage-looking fellow, ras charged writh striking a yonth named Sampson Tayloracross the face writh a ca dran's whip. The complainant, a genteel-looking boy abont 1 years of age, who exhibited a severe whealon his face, said, he was crossing ~Mansion-house-street, when he put his hand upcon a ladder that projected fromn the bask of the waggon the prisoner was driving, upon wvhich the prisoner, w.ithout uttering a word, cut him violently over the face with a whip, Alderman W nr.-What answer have you to the charge, jirisoner? Prisoner.-He was sitting behind, and so I cut him. The lad emphatically denied this statement, and said he simply had his hand on the ladder. -J. Henderson, constable 472, said that three gentlemen who witnessed the occurrence told him the prisoner had acted very brutaly in cutting the boy over the face, he therefore took him into custody. Prisoner.-I am very sorry I hurt him ; but he had no business behind my waggon. It wvas not much of a cut, Sir R. W. CxRDSN.--You might have cut the lad's eye out, and your regret would not have given it back agin. Prisoner.-It was more accident than anything else. Alderman WmE.-To teach you that you must not do things of this sort for the future, and then plead accident, you must be fined 10s., or go to prison for 14 days. The prisoner was locked up for want of money to pay the fine till just before the arrival of the van, when he managed to get the amounut and was liberated, The LonRD h.LYoa requested that the press would aclmnow. ledge the receipt of the following donations to the poorbox - -From " F.

Bow-sTREET.-An elderlv man, named John Pinkerton, who keeps several common lodging-houses in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and elsewhere, and has long been suspected by the police of receiving stolen goods, was charged with having-in his possession a large quantity of property, aleged to be the proceeds of numerous robberies. Sergeant Thomas, of the F division, having received information with respect to the disposal of a quantity of linen stolen a few weeks back from a laundress's cart, called at No. 6, Charles-street, where the prisoner lives, and searched the premises. He found a considerable quantity of linen, some of which was easily identified aspart of that stolen. Among these were two sbeets, originally marked " Charingcross ohspital" in three places. The marks had been cut away and large patches sewed on. There were also some towels, from which the same mark had been cut away, bhut they bore a thread-mark which the laundress had made to distinguish those belonging to different wards. In a cupboard, of which prisoner had the key, Thomas found three watches. nine rings, 13 breast-pins, and 12 duplicates of wvatches. In another room he found a number of pieces of silk, all of an expensive kind, and a variety of miscellaneous property, to the estimated value of 1001. The officer seized the whole of the property descnbed, and took Pinkerton into custody. The sheeta and towels having been identified by the laun. Thormas applied for a remaud. lie bad no doubt the whole of the property was stolen, and believed he should be able to find tne owners of most of it. The prisoner reserved his defence, and the remand was granted. Robert Arthur Lynch, a youth of about 16 years of aÃ¯Â¿Â½e was charged with obtimnin 480 postage stamps, by fase pretences, from the Stamp-office, Somerset-house. On Monday week the prisoner entered ibe service of Mr. RHaifax, a stationer in Oxford-street, as errand-boy. In the course of that day Mr. Halifax sent another, lad to. the Stasmp-officc to order 480 envelopes impressed with the medalion stamp, which, by the r2les of theh establishment; must be paid for in advance.

*- TIEP JULY FETES AT BRUSSELS. (TheM Oflk W , 1... . - i e BEtISSBLS, TNM3nDAY MoRYING, JULY 24. The thrree days' kolyday termoinated last niight with a display of firoworks, let off frosii an open paee in the vicinity of the Place St. Joseph. - Altogether they wece of much, the same kind aa those xhinifed in the LIondon parks on the celebration of the peace, though an illuminated view of the Chateau de Laeken and an allegorical temple surmountedby a crown connected them with the festivities of the day. Everyplace from which a sight of the transient gories could- be obtained was denselythronged, and, as the King anid his family saw them from anlapartmeant situate behind' the temporary throne on the Place, a new opporWnity for shouting "V Y-;ie le Poi !' was afforded to the delighted multitude, who hailed the Royal carriages as they approached and depaxted from the site of observation. As an eccentriCity of yesterday, it may be mentioned that the celebrated " Mannikin" in the Rue du Chene, which, though so repugnant to English notions of propriety, is held in high honour by the citizens of Brussels, was dressed in a regular Court suit, in which a hat and sword were conspicuons articles. Well-dressed persons of both sexes thronged around the decorated " Mannikin," and laughedaloudto see him so fnelyaccoutred. Those who are acquainted with Brussels usages wiU be well aware. of the little gentleman's position as the "oldest citizen," and those who are not will do well to abstain from further inuiry on the subject. Amaong the cars sent by the provinces to form part of yesterday's cavalcade was one from Louvain, symbolical of the brewer's craft. UJnfortunately, it broke dovwn, and consequently never met the Royal vision. 13ritish teetotaiLers, who fanlcy that the biAre de lo uvaimb bears some resemblance to the beer of Barclay and Perkinss, will probably rejoice when they read of this untoward event. Their joy will be diminished when they learn that, considered as an intoxicating beverage, it ought rather to rank with gingarbeer than with any English product of malt and hops. This morning, the scene at the great railway station was most wonderfuL All Belgium having been for three days eompressed into one thick mass, was resolving itself into its pristine elements, and endless were the files of passengers and baggage that were disciplined into military order, to prevent a universal anarchy. How everybody got home is a problem that seems perfectly insoluble. So ends the great holyday, during which a whole people determined to enjoy itself in one town for three consecutive days with scarcely an hour's interraption-a holyday of which I have only described the great national features, omitting whole episodes of concerts, flower shows, Flemish plays, poetical contests in French and Flemish, &c., which filled up the narrow interstices between the large shows. The old adage which declares that "Christmas comes but once a year" is intended to provoke an exuberance of jollity, and the claims of a holvday that comes at the end of 25 years must be great indeed. This was thoroughly felt by the Belgians, and most fuly were the claims satisfied. One word more before we take leave of this delightful fete. It was essentially a fete for the nation-for the whole mass of the people, as distinguished from any privileged class. Every eeremony that was in any degree characteristic of the occasion took place in the open air, and could be seen gratis by all who did not mind a gentle squeeze. That the people might be accommodated, the Place St. Joseph became a room out of doors; when the alle,orical cavalcade passed, the police took care that the aristocrat who had five francs at command should not allow his hired chair to impede the view of his less fortunate brother. When the principal Boulevards were turned into halls of light the carriages were kept at a distance, and tna poor man was allowed for once in his life to roam through a fantastic palace, far more glittering than the habitations of Royalty.
HOMES FOB THE HOMfELESS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Bnt a comparatively short time has elapsed since you pleaded the cause of the Crimean soldier, and secured for him huts when he bad no shelter, clothing when he was in rags, and fuel when he was perishing with cold. Among his countrymen at home you created an interest in hiswelfare which had never been felt before, and which became prac.ically beneficial in originating inquiries into the state of his barrack accommodation, his educational resources, his diet, and his pay. At the close of the war ho returns to find all Tevised, all improved, and he acknowledges with gratitude the unexpected chaanges which the potent voice of The Tises has effected during his absence. If your power to draw the attention of a liberal public to the condition of the private soldier has thus been so beneficially exercised, is it too much to believe that were another class equaUy deserving of your sympathy to be brought before your notice the amelioration of its condition might likewise share your attention? True it has none of the " pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war" to herald it, but its members have long and patiently fought the hard battle of daily life, demanding of them shelter, clothing, aind fuel, but deaying the glories of Inker. mann and the Alma as their reward. It is to the firs and mostimportantof these demands-that of shelter-that the following brief remafks have reference: -The poor man, in this wilderness of brick, has no home; of. the myriads of dwellings with which it abounds hardly one is suited to his means or requirements. The dens in which he finds refuge at the conclusion of his daily toil are rapidly disappearing before the march of metropolitan improvement; and perhaps it is as well that the earth is about to relieved of so odions a burden, as its removal offers an opportunity too rare and too favourable to be neglected-insisting, as it does, most strongly, on the necessity of substituting habitations which shall secure to their occupants at least the decencies and privacy of domestic life-the firs' great element in the creation of selfrespect and social elevation. Give to a man a domain-no matter how limited its area-which he can call his own, and which he can mrake comfortable according to his own ideas, and the chances are that you give him his strongest and surest safeguard against proffigacy and vice. The at tractions of home will lessen those of the publichouse; the latter wiU be forsaken, and the earnings thus saved contribute to strengthen the ties which bind him to his own fireside- "That mystic circle which surrounds Pleasures and interests, never know-n beyond Its sacred limits." How, then, is this desirable end to be accomplished? First, by ascertaining the requirements of the class to be provided for; and, secondly, by fulfilling those requirements practically and economically. With the exception of the proprietor of the buildings in Grosvenor-mews, which were the sabject of a letter to The Times a month or two ago, all those who have been engaged in the erection of model dwellngs have overlooked the very class for which they are most essentiaL They have provided most comfortable and commodious tenement3 for those who can afford to pay for them, but those whose weeldy earnings vary from l0s. to 15s. are as destitute of accommodation as they were before model dwellings were ever though:t of. Three shilings z- week has been proved to be sufficient to secure all the comfort which is necessary, consisting of two rooms, a living room and a bedroom, 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches, and 14 feet by S feet 6 inches respectively, the former furnished with a range, containing boiler, oven, hot plate, &c.; a sink, with aplentiful supply of fresh water; two cupboards and a recess for half-a-ton of coals, with dust-shaft, closet, &c., attached. Four shillings secure an additional bedroom, but where the families are young this is never required. The supply of the above arcommodation has proved itself profitable as an investment, and the demand is so great that to an indifferent observer it must appear strange that philanthropists are unconscious of it. Philanthropists are, however, not unconscious of it; they are not only aware of the work which lies before them, but they are wiling to aid in its advancement, by providing pecuniary means with no stinting hand. Several could be named with this knowledge and inclination, but they are ignorant of the means to turn either to account, to -whom to pay their money, or to whom to apply for a guarantee that this money shall bo wisely and profitably expended. While, then, there are some anxious and able to serve, and several earnestly desirous of being served, the one suffering from the inaction, not the indifference of the other, it has been suggested that the best means of securing satisfaction to both were to write to T'he Time, stating the forego;ng facts, and drawing attention to a recent propotal, which it is believed is the most likely to prdve a rady and safe means of accomplishing the desired obJect ith 5cCcess I ecose my Card, Sir, but, ta it is considered udesirable that asy names ahonid 3obrou,ht prominentl -foiward at pree-en< peudkio.pbilantopy and puffery too oftn Joining hand inlhand-further details and particnlar+2na; be loarnt of "Delta," atNo. 4, qrafaJgar souare, Chadnag.croe, who ^sill b happy to render ererj necee^y inf4nntion.

NILITIA. The Royal South Middlesex Militia, underColonel Scriven, were disembodied yesterday. The men returned quietly to their homes, and there was not a single expression of muar. muring or discontent. Every man had, on his leaving, upon an average, 26s. in his pocket. This re'iment is above 800strong, has served in the garrison of lPortsmouth and in Ireland, has given 600 men to the line, and volunteered for foreign service. A regimental order was issued by Colonel Scriven upon the day ofthe disembodiment, stating that Her 3Iajesty had been pleased to convey, through the Lord-Lieutenant of the county, her high sense of the zeal and spirit which the regiment had always exhibited. The commanding officer, -i bidding farewell to the regi. ment, expressed the pleasura he felt at having the command of such a body of men, and assured them that he should be happy at any time to do all in his power to advance their interests.
IRELAND. (FaOm OUR eww OORREZsroNDET.) DUBLIN, FRIDAY MoimrG. THE FLETr AT QIEENSTowN. The following announcement of the departure of the naval squadron at Queenstown appears in the ICork Consbituton of yesterday morming:- " Yesterday it was currently stated in Cork and Queenstown that orders had been received by the officers in conmand of Her Mjesty's ships Dulke of Wellington, Conqueror, Fortb, Mohawk, and Lapwing to get everything in readiness for immediate departure.

The vessels take t.heirdepartorefrom Qneenstowvn harbour early this morning. their destiantionL is not known with certainty, one rumour firng it at the Clyde, while some persons assert that the essels are to proceed to Bantry Bay, to remain on the Irish coast for some weeks during the summer and autumn." MR. JUSTICE KEOGH. The joint efforts of the two eextreme politicoreligious parties in Ireland to raise a cry against the elevation of Mr. Kdogh to the judicial bench have been from first to last a most decided failure, and the malcontents must turn to some other quarter for more tangible capital to carry on the trade of misrepresentation. The record and special jurors Of the county of Mayo, consisting of men of all shades of creed and politics, have urnanimously signed an address to the learned Judge congratulating him upon his promotion and presenee among them, and a similar mark of respect has been paid him by the grand jury of the town of Galway, the birthplace of Mr. Keogh. ARB. SMT O'BRIN. A letter addressed by ir. Smith O'Brien to a parish priest in the county of Clare is confirmatory of the reported intention of the former gentleman to take no part in public affairs at present :- "' For a variety of reasons (he says), which it is not necessary now to recapitulate, I am desirous at present to avoid public meetings. I must therefore entreat you to abandon your intentioma of bringing to Dromoland, on Sunday next, your warm-hearted flock, nd hope that they will be satisfied to accept in lien of a personal interview this expression of my thankg for the proposed demonstration of their attachment."

A LUNAR RAINBOW. TO T EDITOR OF THE TM.S. Sir,-On Wednesday, the 23d of Jfuly, at about 1145 p.m., I observed a perfect lunar rainbow. The night had ben clear and bright, and the atmosphere unusually dry and hot in this p art of the coimtry-the south-eastern portion of Essex-tll shortly befome 11 p.m., with occasional flashes of summer lightning. From that time a storm drew on gadually becoming of a more decided character. Flashes of lihtning, forked as well as sheet, in quick succession and equaUing in briliancy anv which I remember to have seen in the tro ics, shotacrossthesky, mostly fromN.W. to S.E. The light of the moon, though in the second night of the last quarter, was from time to time quite overpowered by the atmospheric illumination, though bright enough itself before to enable me to seo the figeres on the dial of a smaL lady's watch, and to read printed matter in the type of a leading article in lbe l7.^nes. At length a thick black cloid covered all the N.W. and W., and the rain began to fall in large drops before the shower. Instantly the arch of the lunar rainbow began to be formed against the thunder cloud in the west. In less than two minutes it was complete, and of the brightest silvery colour throughout. In less than two minutes more it had faded almost ot of sight, and had onite disappeared by 1150 p.m., when the rain was falling ve~ry heavily. I have twice before seen such lunar rainbows ; one in the north-west Highlands of ScotLand, the other in the West of Esngln; but neither of them wvas nearly so perfect inkform and olon as he oe sen byme o thenugh ofthe 23dl I have taL-en astronomical notes, &o., which are very much at the service of any friends of the celestial scienoa who may wish to see them.
