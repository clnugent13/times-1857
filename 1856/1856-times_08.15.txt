LOZ-DOZ4 -FIDAF, A4UG ST 15. 156. Rikaa, thougn with a new EM BR and fresh -opportunities, seems far from disposed to enter the peth. of reform. The obstinate and sullen spirit atill* lives-humiliations are, -it would appear, qnc3t already forgotten, and both CzAR and IKople are As ready as ever to play th6 old gane -of pride, violence, and cunning, which was successfuL-for more than. 150 years. ut iWe cannot think that at the present time such A display will be successful. - Common prudence would advise: a more giadual and les de-_on _trtve return to the asimptions aud zlcea(~ of former days. It is but a few inonthA since Russia accepted the terms of peace proposed through Austrian mediation. At that time we er. told daily by the Russian pres in Emropa of the sincerity and moderation of the C-ZAr. To Welieve cetain- prints and certain politicians, U.usgia wa3 ;a laud of good faith, and her- unamb-Itious' people were- 1t in' astonis:hmen at te, design imputed,to them by the misguided *Obnet~ of the. West., About last February, -*hen the rep t D!tives of Europe were to 3acef, in Faris2 . the .toneo of every RBian ogan was most migniloquent and ligh-mined. -'ee,~ goodwill to all me; popalar instution, ~a.ways,'- cahals, improyeI agriculture, iree ; sd'y wera ii',the heartVof every Russian. A l of goodfnmoued pity was the answer to -thos ,wo hinted thlit MscOvit 'policy nuig still renmn un4hnged cnd- that it woI ul wL 1 to lake uarantees while we were still strong; united, and in earnest.;- All tbis-lasted until peace wpa made, and Russia obtained conditions, wih which Ehe had- no- rea,n to beodis'tisfied. - wo, owever, all: is changed., Cronstad is no longer threatened; Poland is for ever abandoned by the West, and wnll be fully Russianized before- wa-again -visits Europe; Bssarabia, with the exception of a narrow sip, -is- preserved; the Caucasus still remains a Rtussian, possession. The CZAR is about to be crowned with ijmuch splendour, and all Europe is -flocking to -tie sight. Russia is again taldng her stand as a great Plower, and is no longer a vast prison, with a Sovereign, nobility, -and people placed under the ban of the world. Hence the old, inveterate obstinacy, revives; the old cunning is once more to be t-ried to discover if it can, as of yore, command success. - - There can be no doubt of the unwillingness of Rumsia to cede quietly and honourably what has become by treaty the property of the Ottoman State. We shall, perhaps, have it explained with many details that the difficilties we complain of were unavoidable ; that the destruction of Kars and the Danubian forts was strictly legal, and that the occupation of Serpents Island was only some -aansaction connected with the lighthouse. But factosstill remain on record. It is certain that the conduct of the Russians has induced- ,England again to occupy-the Black Sea The Hannibal has been sent to Serpents Island, and sufficient intimnation has been given that in the opinion of the allie3 somethingE lie a breach of faith has taken place. Compare the conduct of France and England with that of their late enemy. The allies had more than 250,000 men in the East. They had prepared, far from tleir own countryz imraer.= stores of food, clothing, and warlike naferial,- in expectation of long hostilities. Every man and horse and gun had to be brought away by sea, at a time when transport was scarce and dear. Yet in four months, two-thirds of the time allowed, not only the Crimea but Turkey itself has been cleared of the allied troops. We learn from Constantinople today that after the departure of a flotilla then about to sail scarcely a thousand Frenchmen would be left in Turkey. Our own naval and military establishments have been broken up, and soon Scutari will retain no traces of us except the graves of the dead and the monument which commemorates them. - This promptness, so honourable to both nations, has not been imitated by Russia. Although Kars is but some 30 miles from her own frontier, and held but by a few thousand men, she is there still, destroying works, cutting down forests, refusing EngEsh officers the right of visiting the spot, andc during her little term of poWer, playing the despot after the fashion of Wars3w or Tiflis. The same is the case at the mouth of the Danube. -Russian troops are still there, and will remain until the latest day allowed by treaty, with perhaps the desperate hope that something will happen to enable them to refuse the cession altogether. The part of Bessarabia which is to be added to the Principalities is still in Russian hands, and the CzAp. raises doubts on the topography, and would, as far as may be judged :rom appearnces, gladly evade the condition which for the first time causes his frorntier to recede. We do not certainly think that any practical result will followr from these litigious and undi,nified displays. The other Powersarefartoonmuch in earnest to allow any trifling in matters of such importance. It will be observed that Austria, who perhaps knows her neighbour better than we do, has not yet evactuated the Principalities, although she ought to have done so some time snce. She is; no doubt, waiting untilRussia shall have performed her part of the engagement. That when the end of the six months comes wo sainl see the Russians unwillingly depart is :crt-ain enough. 'We may in future times have to watch their designs for the recovery of their former territory, but that they will acquieswe for the present we know, because we have the power to enforce it. BEt the spirit' of the Court of St. Petersburg is not the less apparent. It can hardly be to impose on civilized nations that the Russian Sovereign makes this display of impotent obstinacy. Indeed, the impression it must leave on Europeans is rather that Russia is weaker and more sorely vwounded than was thought. To see her lingering at the spots she must leave, and performing acts of paltry tyranny to the last, cannot raise her in the eyes of German or Italian. But it may be that. on some ignorant and confiding races the spectacle of her armed 'occupation after the alies have left the East may have an influence. If she hold Kars after P?rance and England have withdrawn their arnies from Constantinople, the fact may be explained consistently with Russian interests amnong nations to whom Russia alone spea'ks. Nevertheless, in tne end such subterfuges can be of little avail, and the conduct of Rusia, by destroying any nascent feeling of confidence among the Western nations, will bring on her evils far overbalancing any advantages which a, diIatory evacuation can procure.
The jealousy of Government patronage and protection which characterizes us as a nation requires, like many- other wholesome biases, its proper checks and cautions. If we are to go into one extreme or another. this is doubtless a much more healthy one than that of too much dependence upon Government. We have the result, indeed, of the two systems before our eyes in the general condition of this country, as compared with continental States. On the continent the Government is everything. it is the spring of public activity, and is the suggestive and the intiative part of the body -politic. The Government is the educator, the nurse, and the purveyor of the community,-col1ects pictures, establishes schools, constructs railways. With us the Government takea only a secondary' part, and comes in as a monitor and supervisor, while the moving spring and fountain of improvement- is the popular mind itself. The public itself is the great executive; and, certainly, the result is 'not unfavourable as compared with the continental one. We are 1;eforehand in the great march of improvement, and private companies have spread a network bf "iail-ways - over this country, -while on the coistinent a few trunk-lines are the only witnesses as yet to the effectiveness of a Government initiative. But there are exceptions to every goodl rule. Particular lines, of art and science may lie 0o completely outside of the main sphere of national activity that if they are left to themselves they will pine and die, like branches cut off from the parent stem. 'The great reservoir of national life and interest which feeds the other departments does not coummunicate with them, and a public which flings [itself -with ali its might into the work of practical and commercial improvement and expansion has not i time to attend to 'the, more refined, delicate, and minute departments of tas te, art, and abstract touience. The main work of the age can get on them; we can be rich, powerful, and great as a nation without succeeding in such linea. We throw them aside, therefore, a'sso much mnere prettiness 'and luxury, which can 'wait till buai'neas is done, and till we have done all, as a trading ,andmanufacturing nation, that we ecai do. It is unnecessary to sayhow long 'this will be. The Rorans waited till they had conquered the world before they condescended to attena to literature, oratory, or philosophy lterbis 7 isa limited portion of Nser i,Trh4de and manufactures Iare infinitei ;-Aps-on Alps aise; the- more p- grew we make'the m6re -*e hall- want to make. If we wait, then, till we have dono all as a manufacturing and trading nation *hich we .cai do before we give our attention to certain iner departmentz of iniprovement, we shall wait for ever; and ior this interval, which wil never come to an ena,Â§these-wil xiinply-have languished. Thisis subject-niatter, then,which requires a gentle application of artificial stimulus and the fostering hand of Governmentpatronage. - 4- We make these remarks with reference1to the Th'ird Report of the D8pari;nent of- Science and "Art." With all its jeslousy of Government patronage the English public will hardly object to the moderate encouragement given by GCovernment to the-different lines of taste and science embraced fitfiuiji his '~ deatment. ' If we 'aroi tobu iuSYto correct our deficiencies, We " t any rate 'kow them, and Inow, therefore, on what' points artificial stimulus is wanted. *We'- are all ready,' to admit, for ,example, ; our shocomings in worIks of art in :whicli beauty,Â°f design is needed. The Great Exhibition, inkAed, brought tis fact strongy home to, us. We Can do without this luxury, it is'true. Our spooins, our forks, our ladles, our fish-knive our dishes and covers, can all perform their' respective functions perfectly well whateier-shape they adopt: Our teapots and coffeepots are, :happily, unconscious of their deformity, and are not ashamed of themselves when they come into society; they therefore do not act,am se. Our urnsj,with shape-fshape it may be called-so gratuitously cumbrolls that it is A cO".4"ug probleia hwit-culd ever have prezsented itself to the designing niind, unless a distressing nightmare brought it out of the unlnown world, or its conception took place in a fit of religious despondency-our - urns, weo say, still possessthe usefulfaculty of holding-hot water. wow objectless, poor, and feeble is our chasing, where it is not coarse and repulsive; but the inside is all the same, whatever be the pattern of the outside. Stil, when ugly shapes andtasteful ones are seen togetherwe prefer beauty, and wonder how. we could ever have been content with suchugly apparitions on our dinner and breakfast tables. But here the English mind is at present defective. The foreigner beats us. Look at :French bronzework, turn even to the less esoteric subject of paper patterns, where the sphere of the: artist verges on that of the upholsterer. How bold, inventive, and brilliant is the French upholsterer compared to the English ! How he dashes off a pattern' for the waU of your saloon that. Eiiglish art would have shrunk from, never supposing it possible that sueh a design could have answered; yet it does answer its purpose and takes the eye. In- the defect of national taste, then, the pressure of business, and the want of time for attending to superfluities under which the nation at large labours, the " Departnent of Science and Art," working under the supervision of a Committee of' Privy Council, gives only a proper amount of Government patronage to these lines of ornamental art. We believe the operation of this patronage has been favourable, aud that alreadly an improvement has taken place - in our works of design. There are other subjects which this department takes up, and on which its services have also beenconsiderable. Thegeological branch has been very effective, and the mining statistics -which have been accumulated promise to be decidedly .useful. The " Department of Science and Art" has, indeed, suffered sromewhat in general estimation from the too benignant smiles, and too sedulous protection of the PBinirE CoNsour, ana it is said also that this, like most other departments in which patronage comes in, has not been whiolly free from the -chage of jobbi.g. We cannot doubt, bowever, that,-making -proper allowances; the application of Government aid to these lines of taste and science has been advantageous. The summary of the report places before us in a condensed form the results of the working of the department; and, among other satisfactory signs, it appears that the Schools of Art have been attended by nearly 12,000 pupils. If this is the case we may reasonably5 look to some improvemnent in English taste, and to some amendment in our ornamental art and works of design. There is no reason why we should suppose that there was any radical defect in the English mind in this departmaent, or that Eng'ish taste was irrevocably bad. That we can criticise our own workmanship and see our own shortcomings shows the presence of elementary art in the national mind, which only requires developing to attain to maturity. The. bustle in which we live as a trading nation has hitherto prevented this; but, if proper encouragement is given to these tastes, and if a quiet corner is gained for their cultivation, we may naturally expect that the proper growth will take place. So far certainly as gru;mbling 'and crliicising are a sign3 of taste, we [may congratulate ourselves, for - we grunble and criticise enough. No one is more critical than an educated EnglishnAn. -But to have an idea and to be able to express it are different things. We hope this new school will -facilitate the expres3ion of the national taste. - -
* The,return of Â£li3s aNrosr .to this country has been so unobtrusive that probably not many persons are aware that thTe lady who had won for herself so high a reputation for humanity in the East during the reeent war is once more back in her own country. She left Turkeyin the 'same quiet 'way -in 'which she arrived in England. Her instinctive good taste and right fe,eling. taught her that sueh exertions as those which had .been made by-herself and her sisters in the cause of humanity could not with propriety become the subject of a triumph or ovation. The reward they look for it is not in man's power to bestov;. 'They do well td, leave honoursmand crosses and such matters to the General Officers, and to rest quietly -on. the.conviction -that the extent of their labours and sufferings is duly ap- preciated by their- countrymen. The actual risk. they ran was not.. small.

Noaoubt, under ordinary cirbumstanceg, 'i4 tbil ,ountry a lady-nurseiE not a very profitable adjunct to an: 'hospital, but in tha East'the case was widely different. in England the . hospitals . are - f.or the most part admirably maraged, -and- their adinmistrators, lay or mBdkcal; are directly' under the control of public:'opinion. Wheni female assistance is neededlit can ' be procued in abun-. dance. Th6 relatives of the patient are admitted to his bedside.

Wliat tney could not accomplish by actual strength of a-m Athey could bring about by their intelligenlce and by the influence tery- acquired over the staff of the hospital. Mis sonIGNG'A1, indeed, appears to possess a high power of organization. It -would n6t be d6ing justice -to her peculiar ability to speak of- her in -any -way as a lady-nurse, if the term: mplies aught of detraction from the ful value of her exertions. By il accounts she is fally, competent to:tak9;'chAarge of the nursing arx rangements of any large hospitaL She possesses the power of control 'and the - fitness: for conmmand, as well as the cdeepest tenderness of feeling and boundless - sympathy with suffering humanity. We hav'e an especial right to be heard on this_-p6int, .for the gentleman who 'was charged with the duty of distributing t1he purchases'made on account of what was called The Times Fund was constantly brought into con, tact with Miss NiGHTnGAnT. He.has ever,spoken in the warmest terms.of the quickness.of her intelligence, of herforesight,of her finnness,-inaword, of 'her peculiar fitness for the trying duties which she had imposed 'upon herself. Scutari hospital when things were at, the'worst was no scene of dilettantism. There was stem work to be done in the midst of the most lamentable confusion, and the moat agonizing incidents of human suffering. Miss NIGHTINGoAE was equal to the occasion. She greatly helped to introduce order where all was disorder, 'and to procure for the poor soldiers comforts-and appliances of which they were wholly- destitute before she appeared -in the wvards.. We are not dealing ,judt now with considerations of mere sentiment; we speak of fresh linen and cleanliness-of food such as could be swallowed by the sufferers in their distressing eondition,-matters of as much importance as the purely medical treatment. Probably there wiUl never again exist, so violent a necessity for volunteer'service as there was in the hospital at Scutari when things were at the worst, during the winter months of last year. It is not, however, just now our object to challenge the shortcomings of those who. did not do their duty, but to write a few heartfelt w.ords of weleome-back to that lady who did far more than her duty. In the coure of a fow months Mis NIHouTliOGALhasmnanaged to do mbie -good than a hundred benevolent people who iive the average term of maes existence can hope to cram into their whole lives. Her name has been pronotunced between two blessings by thousands of men upon whom her good influence has passed in the midst of their anguish of body and of mind. The singular absence of " canf' of any kind is to be noted in this lady's actions and words. There is no unction, no theological slang, in her proceedings. She does good, and she passes on. We remember well, when Miss NWIGHTn(;AL first commenced her operations in the East, it was said that she had gone there to proselytize. The accusation, however, was so strongly at variance w;ith the facts, that in a short space even maliee, envy, and spite gave it.up as impracticable diet. Other 'people may have done cleverer, we doubt if many have done braver things than MEss NIGHUnGALE; but certainly few have had the power and the inclination to perform works of Christian charity on so extensive a scale. All England, we are confident, will join us most cordially in the wish that this excellent lady may be spared for many years of happiness-whkich meanls, no doubt, tO MiSS NIGernTINGA the opportunity for 'doing good.
If it is right in private charities not to let the left hand knoI what the right hand doeth, it may be a duty to violate the rule in matters of public beneficence.- lost persons will be amious to. know what has been the result of the subscription.opened in behalf of those who suffered bv the late inundations in France, and thi3 from no desire to magnify what has been done,'but rather from a -wish to obtain some sure indication of the national feeling. It will probably be -remembered that, prompt. as the LoRD M&Yon was in caling the meeting at the Mansion-house, he did not taake this step without first ascertaining from the Prefect of the Seine that the sympathy of the English expressed in a public subscription would not be offensiye to . the French people. They certainly do not require our charity, and it would have beei fitile to offer it. But it was felt that we miight offer our sympathy and ass,stance, and- that -to--be -permited to give Athis was an -honour to us. - With this view the subscription list was, opened, and now that it is aboutf to be cloed it, is entirely with this view that we. ssum up the 'result. ,The total collected must be .more than- 1,000,0O(Y francs. Of this Liverpool, Birmingham. and som-'e other- towsi in Engiaid 'have 'sentAheir- qao6ta direct to Paris;.'-Scitlnd, tbo; with s:ome of the old feeling -which has kept aliv and..ws t. this day the meniory of its French allisnces, -sent its offering in the sanme wvay.

TO THE BDITOB OF THE TZMES. Sir,-I am anxious to furisoh a piece of information to travellers on the continent, especially along the Rhine and in Switzerland, which, I believe, is not to be found in fu7rray, or any other handbook. NYot every one@s stomach is proof against ihe abominable decoction of sour grapes, which,under all sorts of hardl.nmes, is palmed off upon the inexperienced traveller in those countries, even though rendered less unpalatable by the addition of sugar and Seltzer water. Thousands would gladly exchange their thin RRhenish for a glass of light, wholesome beer, if they k,ew -where to get it; but, except at the principal watering-places, where, I suppose, the claims of invalids are more tenderly condiered, the landlords of most of the hoteLs along the Rhine, and throughout Switzerland, are anited in a firm conspiracyagainst malt liquor, exceptit be English porter or bitter ale, at 2f. a-bottle. Now, it may be useful to such persons to know that there is not a single town-scarcely even a village in the above-mentioned regions, in which exceUlent beer is not to be obtained-generally of the Bavarian quality -atrabouthaif the priceof ordinarybeerinEngland.

When the bitter prejudices of the old iindoos against any. inovation -siminly as such-are re: mambered, these numbers are equivaIent to a' leclaration of opinioni in favour of the biL .. It la -been found necessary to limit the right of the adult widow over her owvn children, bat this, oncession' to prejudice imiatters little, It is the child-widow for whnoi we are. legislating. Adult widows will not often. avail themselves of the privilege. :Eindoo women 'wither so zapidly that thzy will scarcely be ioight for their money, and tha control of the husband is in this country so absolute that wealthy widows will probably prefer indep?endence. It is the child-widow whose husband dies before she enters his house who will benefit. In this country, between the tropical climate and a coGe of manners lam beyond what Europeanms can evei conceive, such widows are certain to go wrong. Hindoo fathers are wvell aware of the danger, and heavy dowries wil be given to overcome the lingering prejudice and secure the family permanantly from disace. ,lr. Grant hs just pledged himself 'to the extir)ation of a similar abuse. Sote centuries ago ullal Sen, then ruling in Beng6l, imported five Brahmins from the north to improve the standard of learning among his own priests. Their [descendants are the "K coln," or high-born Brahmins of Bengal. These men, partly to preserve their pedigrees, and partly to make money of their superior sanctity, hare introduced some monstrous customs into the country. They claim the privilege of dispensing with lindoo law as to affinity, which is siricter than that of Pome, and marry lirst cousins, nieces,and aunts. They also clainthe right of marrying as many wives as they please. No Brahmin can _euse a Kooln's ajliance. They therefore demand heavy dowries, and leave their wives upon the fathers' hands. They sometimes never even vsit t-hem, and the wretched women, married but widows, add one more to the thousand sources of native corruption. Strange to say, all this happens while the Roolins, their pride, etheir customs, and their character, are all alike detested by the community. The Legislative Council has been deluged rith petitions praying for the extirpation of the nuis&nce. It is to be at once abo' lished. According to the Friend of Izdiea, Mr. Grant intends to go still further, and strike at the custom of polygamy itself. This is regarded as a dang,erous experiment, but it is always difficult to ascertainth ie eal opinion of the native communlity. Rindoos in Bengal are not much addicted to- the practice. It is a fundamental larw of their creed that a man must have a son. Accordingly if the wife, up to the age of 20, prove barren-women are mothers here at 14-or if she bear only daughters, the husband must marry again. This privilege it is not proposed to abolsh. But some few marry tice even after sons have been born to. them. and it is this practice which it is proposed to abolish. It is not frequent, and is . considered, if not exactly disreputable, stil an indication that the husband is rather a "loose fish." My own opinion is that the law will excite a great degree of irritation, and is uncalled for. Should any such measure be passed, it wi be the first time bigany was over punished in Asia since the days of Lamech. A contest, not without warmth, has sprung up between the missionaries and the indigo planters. The former, powerful in numbers, in their minute Inowledge of the people, and in weight of character, recently passed at a general conference resolutions condemning the planters for oppression. Theplanters -declare that theyiare misrepresented, that the missionaries are prejuaiced agaiust them, and that the native Chrisians are the worst class of the community. Dozens of pamphlets have been published, all illustrativeof the social conditionof Bengal, and mo3tteHling heavily against the planters. Moderate men hold that both parties are guilty of exaggeration. On the one hand, the planters have undoubtedly effected much good for the country.. Tey have introduced capital and new cultivations, have restrainied the tyranny of the zemindars, and. have sometimes really enriched the peasantry. On the other hand, they will never recogani-e the fact that a ryot is not a labourer; but the owner of the soil. They therefore compel him to cultivate indigo, whether he will or mot, and the force thus exerted leads occasionally to _oppression. For themselves, they are like most nglishmen in tropical countries, generous, hospitable, and usually fair in their dealings, but with a genune contempt for the timid, shiftless race dmong whom they dwell, and a tendency to appeal to force on every occasion. The missionaries, again, though perfectly single-hearted in the matter, and Though the instances of oppression they quote arei strictly correct, labour under one disadvantage,.-. they are apt to believe all the statements of their convert3 without suffcient inquiry. In some instances, of course, the converts mean to tell the truth; in others they are simply endeavouring to excite sympathy for themselvesX in all they probably exaggerate,for, Ohristians or not, they are still Asiaties, and stl gifted with the wonderful power of invention characteristic of the race. The discussion has done much good. It has thrown ranch light on some dark places, and has increased the disposition of the public to inquire into the social condition of BRenga. It needs investigation. As I have before mentioned, the Lieutenant'Governor has recorded a minute on the artapegentm for securing justice and repressing zcrime. Like every one else, he considers them indefensible. The key to the entire system is the villaea or rural police. By a law older than lohamedan rule every cluster of 50 houses is bound to maintain a watchman, and pay him. The village system, however, is dead. The villages are not self-governed, and are, in fat, mere clusters of houses. The rights of the inhabitants are transferred to the zemindar, who appoints either a personal servant, or the cheapest and oldest beggar he can find. The consequence is that one-half the police are able-bodied criminals, and the other half feeble-bodied old men. It is an actual fact that a larger percentage of policemen are convicted of heinous crimes than ordiazymen of trivial ofences. The r police intended to supplythe deficiency ae Tretchedly paid, and therefore untrustworthy, while their non-commissioned oficers receive less than many domestic servants. The magistrates are too few to be of any use. The magistrate of the metropolitan district, for instance, has a jurisdiction larger than Yorkshire, over a countrv without a road. lastly, the criminl Law is so lax that it is not fenaed, and the judges soprudish in the matter of evidence that justice is "a lottery." These are almost the words employed by the LieutenantGovernor, and every man in Bengal is aware of their trth. There ia at this very moment a case in the papers in which a man murdered a woman by tearing the fetus from her, andhe received only even years imprisonment. Lest yoa should suspect me of exc_geration, I send the official record of the case. It is a beautiful specimen of -what Warren Bastings called the "'tenderness of our institutions." Mr. Ealliday proposes to remove these evils by enforcing the payment of the village police, increasing the strength of the regular police, improving the position of police officers, trebling the number of magis trates, and introducing juries. The latter inovation, once dreaded, is becoming popular. The Lieutenant-Governor has no power to begin these reforms at once. They involve an expense of aOo,OOOi. a-year, and mlust therefore be submitted to the Court of Directors. The Committee of the Calcutta IUniversity have xesolved that the titIes of degrees shall be the same oz those in England; so in a few year Joyo-opal Ghose, B.A., orEshurchnderChuckerbutty, b.A., 'will take their places among the l'erati of the world. They have also resolved togrant honours for history and a knowledae of physical science. Their recommiendations must be submitted to Governient, and I -will send al details when the rea ult is known. On the. .Sth inst. there was a great meeting in Calcutta in hoiiou- of Miss Nightingale, the Coimnnde-in-Cahief in the chair. The meetin' -was exceedingly well attended, and the speakei; expressed high admiration of the self-devotion exhibited by Mss Nightingale. The feeling is imi. versal throughout Ihdia. Not one native, I believe, attended the m2eeting. A terrible outbreskof cholera has occurred at Agra. which sruck down even the. Europeans. Unuafly we are so exempt from the mcourge that wa become culpably indifferent to the mot ordi- nary precautions.

' - - - : ~ - BOlMBAY, Jtiy 10. ehe lateBstnews fromA-ffgianitais fully courfi. matory- of that which had reahedf us whet - la3t wrote in- regar'd.to-the occupationl of brat-by a Persian force, and the further complication afforded by its presence t o the already diflicult potiont of the Amieer at Candahst. Of the- proceediuigr of the Persian General-a renegade Ruian it i3 said-on enteiing the city we have no very defliita account. It appears probable that the inhabitants, taken by. suprise, deSrived of their own leaders, and awed by'the imposmg numbers of the- eemy and by thefaction of PnnceYnsuf, offered;-no opposition to the entry of the Shah's forces. It may have been hi pat ithe facility of the e6nquest which, if the astory be rue,induced the Pesian fleader to witihdraw hi men rfrom the townr, taking vwith him, however, still more-zurely to assure tIre perfect tranquillity, hostages, chosen fromthefamilies of 15 of.the priincipal chiefs. At this 3uncture, Fsa Ehan, the'leader of the Hferatees in their gallant though fruitless- attempt to repel the invading army, reappears on the scene. Prince Yuauf hears of him in Herat, thinks, doubtless with truth, that. he is there to animate the numerous but depressed national party, and forthwith, assisted by - one Hajee GholamEhan, concocts with a select party of friends a very promising scheme for his assmsination. The Hajee, whether acting in pursuance, or in independence of thegeneraiwish, attempted alone. the life of his brother chief te his own discomfiture. Esa Khan received the fire of -his pistol without effect, and immediately cut him down. Upon this, we. are told, the Persian General, to anticipate, or possibly to repress, a popular outbreak, re-entered the city in force,. seized and imprisoned Ema Ehan,J and trod out every spark of resistance..d Whether the Persians having thus, as would appear,. established a tolerably firm footirg on tlie' han frontier, are seriousy meditating a farther step in advance, must, I imagine, be considered very doubtful. PReports of forward movements already commenced are difficult of credence, if only on account of the numbers said to be employed, and of the extended nature of the aleged scaleo operations. More intelligible and credibe is the assurance that' the Shah has offered through his agents to supply the ex-chiefs of Candahar with a sum of money to be expended in internecine warfare with their relative Dost-Mahomed. But, it seems increasingly probable that the aspiring Armeer, oppressed by debt, disease, and aniosity foreign and domestic, will make hlis .peace with his brother, break up his camp at Candahar, and retire upon Cabul. The mnurderer of Shah S6ojah, that feeble puppet set up - by the English to rule the wild AD'ghan ribes, died lately at Cabul. Whether he was in other respects a- man of mark in the eyes of his people than as the slayer of a king I am not aware, but the attendance at his funeral of the Governor of Cabal and his coadjutor, Dost Mahomed's son, would appearto be the homage of the Baruckszye race, to the memory of one who removed from their path a scion of the Royal and rival family of the Suddozyes. All is quist in the Punjab and in upper India generally, but the increase of the cholera at and in the neighbourhood of Agra forms no insignificmt item in the intelligence of the fortnight. Among* the natives the cases known to and reported by the police have risen to about 100 a-day, of which an average of one-third prove fatal, but these returns are very imperfect, and are thought to underrate the mortity byno less-than one half. Many English also have fallen, especially in the rans of the Company's 3d European R_Ment, - whiose quarters have, consequently been-shifted tothe other side of the Junna. - In the gaol -the diseaseprovedsovirulent that the remaimingprisoners, upwards of 35000 (it is said) in nmaber, have been formed into encampments on the plain. On'the bearing of the two great bodie3 of the native inhabitants under this terrible scourge, a. correspondent of the Delhi Gazdet has the following - - "The Mahomedan temples are nightly thronged, and surrounded with worshippers crying aloud to the Almighty. The Hinaoos fall back upon superstitioa. Their talo is a curious one. One night latoly, about midanight, a horseman rode down to the opposite bank of the Jumna, and called to the ferryman to convoe him over. It was late, it was not worth the fee to take across a smgle m An with his horse. But being promised a large douceur, he agreed, and brought over horse and rider. The strger mounted, and, asking the way to the ne-t westwad village, rode in that direction. As he approached it hen it one of its villagers, and desired him to show the path westward. He refased, and would not be briwbd. Iu the morning this villager was dead of cholara, and his villae was immediately ravaged by the disease." The spread of the disorder to Delhi was appreprehended at the last dates, the continued drought being very unfavourable to health. It had already appeared at Muttra, and was reported to- have shown itself at Alighur. The disturbances in the district -of Ganjan, in the northern part of the Madras Presidoncy, appear to be, for the present, at least, at an end. Accordto the Madras papers, both the military and the civil authorities report favourably of the quietness: of the district. The i?siend of India, however, -in publishing au account of the or in and nature of the disturbances, is not sanguine as to the certainty and permanence of their suppression. Indeed, when we remember the very considerable amount - of trouble which the Santals, gave us last year, and -find that the circumstances of the present rising, if: such it may ba clled,. are not 'entirly dissimnila, it will occur to us that we nijis not too readily, from a single success, conclude 'that our work is accom-' plished. The seat of the late or. existing comrmotion is described as a hilly -tract of country, separated from the sea by a narrow belt of level land. Inhabitng this locality is a tribe of sup- posed aboriginal stock, bearing the name of Sourah,l a race of wild barbarians closely resembling in their haoits their neighbours, and. perhaps congeners, the Khonds, whose practice of human sacrifices theBritish Government has had so much difficulty to suppress. One of these Sourahs, presumably a leading man among them,- was awaiting in -a Government prison the confirmation of a, sentence passed upon him for robbery, when he contrived to make his escape. Flying to his own people, he spread far and wide the story of his wrongs, and m a very short space of time attacked the station wlhere he had been confined with no. less a body (though here we maysuspect exaggeration) than 10,000 men. His arch enemy, the manager of the station, escaped, but the death of seven of -the inferior officials gave some' consolation to his wounEded honour. The people'thus roused' into action, had, it appears, been previo-ily excited by the executionof two of their numberformurderingthe head man of the village. [forwastheolddevice,wlbich the Santal leaders employedwithsuch effect; forgotten. AsDecialmanifestationof thedivinitytookplace. On this occasion the avatar adopted the shape not, as with the Santals, of a cartwheel or -a shower of paper, but of a little brazen image. But the uses to which the trick is turned are the same as in the ease of the rebels of last year, -sanctifying. and rendering indisputa'le the authority of the leader in the eyes of his followers as the sole depository and exnonent of the divine commands. nderi these circuinstances, and taking further into consideration the extremely'difficult and'dangerous nature of the country in which these poor savag6i3 reside, it is not easy v., feel quite sure that All trouble is'over in that quarter. On the other hand, our best information on the 'subject is: hut scanty, and, at any: 'rate,: we have heard of no national grievance-of no feeling like that deep and burning sense of oppression at the hands of the money-lenders which is found-to have pervaded the Santel tiibes t yIar. The Madras Railway was opened as far as Arcot, a 'total distance of 65i miles, on the 28th of; June.

A Pathan, or AfEghan 'officer of rank, in the'service of the Nizaini applied in open Durbar for the paymnent of 'arrears due to' him, amounting, -as he alleged, to . a lac' andl n-half 'of rupees.

The.long break in the mnonsoon here, ' of wrhichL I spoe mny last, and' wfhich wras productive of much' 'sickness, happily terminated a day or two after I wrote, and we soon had lanother couple of feet of rain, giving us in all upwfards of 40) inc'hes, with a monsoon not yet half over.'

Below the G'hauts, then, we are doing well, but above them s at hPoonah, for instance, sI ame sorry to hear that very}ittle rain indeed has yet fallen, though the river Saloeen, swelled by the heavy falls in the mcunteins, rollsby the town in t;antsliing fllness. As is always the case when the rain' thus holds off, the climate of the Dleccan is at present unfavourable. Lord Biphinatone, who was intending to 'go up to licapoorie for. a short. time to-morrow has, in conseqence been advised to postpone his departure. Here, too, thereehas been much sicknes' of late. One death that occurred lately from fever, that of Mr. Peniston, one of theaR.oman Catholic chaplains, has 'caused a deep 'and general feeleng of regret. This gentlemcan was educated, I1 beEeve. in the Eonglish College at iome, and Mr as for some years in 'the college at Malta before hiscomig.g,'to India. H:ere he was ehaplain in a part of the island where thera is always an Englihm giment ewationed the soldiers from which formed the greater part of his congregation.

Mr. lidwara Hay, the mineral and underground agent of the colier from,1854 till Februr,15,sae hti a his duty that the orders of the Manager were proerly carried out, submitting any alteiaa tions that he conceived meoesssry~ to the managr for his approval. He had never m3easured- the quantity of air passing through the mine, bumt thought it was from 15,000 to 20.000 feet a min,ute. 'Unont one occadion, only. he had complalned of the3 ventilation, which was in October last. - On -that occasion. -Morgan Richards, one of the firemen, stated in the office that there Was ga in John Cienaivr's. stall, in thTe district of Xorgan Rowlands, the other firemxrn. He thent visited the mine for the purpose of testing the accuracy of the statemnent, but found no gas, except-insa hlblow place where the roof had falen in. There was not much fir-damp there. He might hav consumed it in a few minutes in s.lap but, as it, was high up and there was no thoroughfare, he7let it remain where it was. In his opinionuthere was no dangerinieavin it. TXhe works isd-considerahlyincreasedlsince he hadlef tho pit.- Rowland Rowlands was overmuan during the latter ~period of witness's agency, mut Jabez Thonms had the sole managemnentof tbeworks. By the jury.-lr. ThoznU never o'bjected to any alteration orimprovement which I suggested wheni it was properly represented. to him, hut there was no occasion on. whichhe gTav me authority to employ as many men as I lied -int maldng particularinmprovem6nts. IL sould not have hesi- tated to Make aLny alteration for which there was urgent necessity, hut, if I hiad an opportunity of seeing Mir. Jainer T-homas next day,- I should not do it, except it wAs absolutely necessary to be done insitantly. By the Coroner.-An inquest was held in Sept3mber last on a Man killedl by an explosion at the new pit. ]ft *hackworth was there, Aa-miade an observation to me that the old kit was badly ventilated abou-t the levEl 'heading, but I pointed out to hima some important alterations that had been made which had improved that ventilation subsequent to Mfr. Mackworth's inspection. - By Mr. Mackworth.-You desird mec to take a mnemorandom of the act of Parliament referring to the inspection of mines. which I did, and afterwards that act, was procured. I remember your mnaking 'some suggestions to me for the improvement of the ventilation; one of which was that. the communication shouald be Made with the new p it. You strongly recommended that, and it maade considerable impression on my miind. I know also that yout were of opinion that there shoulcl be different - splits4of nir instead of one current going. up) the headings, - but I cannot, tell how many splits you. recommended. lonununicated to Mr. Jabez Thomas that you. said it Was neemsaLry to have ,s.rcial roles in the old pit, and some :other suggestions which -you maade. I have heard the - noise of gas- coming from the coal. Blowers (small jets of gas) comeo froma the bottom rsther thxanfroma the top. It has, been" reported to mne that occasionally some of the doors have bee6n left open, hut not the main doors.3.I immediately, examinedthe mine after the report of one of the firemen that there was firedamp in John Cemawr'~-headirg, but fou'nd very. littlegs there, and none issuin froma beltowIle-vain.

I was not discharged for inter-fering too much in the -underIground Management, but diskharged myself-th&t is I Iresigned. You may draw your oDwn eTonclusions as to the cause. Probably I might havea seen something looming in the fut;are.~ I do rot kniow that since the explosion Richards has descended the pit and dizco-vered the very fire-damp, by tapping the heading, which he menutionedl to mne nine monthsg aDo. By the Coroner.-I Think that with care the downcast shaft is sufficiently large to supply air to the pi notwithstanding the increase of the worls. In my opinion the explosion occurred through a deficiency of-the air in the whole of the works. I cannot tell exactly where it originated, but the strongest indications of fire were at the bottom of Griffith Williams's cross-heading (the very futhest eXtremity of the mine). After coming: down The cromheading it went in different directions a short distance p Salathiel's and the level heading, and down to iforgan Griffith's dip. I also traced the effects of the fire down the wiadway, and along the lerel to Jacob's heading, where a door appears to have been blown away. T did not go far into Jacob's heading beciuse I met gas. The doors of Moses' and Charles's headings were also blown out. The inquest was adjourned at 7 o'clockThis morning the Court assembled- at 10 o'clock, but, before any witnesses were examined, Mr. Owen, representing the great inconvenience and loss occasioned to numerous persons wLhom he represented, and who wero quite read to be exunined, applied to the Coro.- ner that they should be examined as speedily as possible. Mr. Huddleston did not object to the exafnin&tion of such witnesss, but thought that the questions should come through the Coroner alone. lr. Ponlden, the Government assessor, said that, at all eventg, Mr. O wen should be-alowed to suggest his questions to the coroner. - Rowland Rowlands,who had been examined previously to the adjournment, in order to iaentify the bodies and the pses where they vwere obind, was now recalled, and examiined on the general conduct of the. undergrounrd -por-- tion of the olliery. The duties of theiirmenne were to go down the pit every morning before the colliers descended, and examine all the headings and stallskr. -which 3men Ladto wrork, in order to discover hether any fire-damp had aSCumulated in them. Those firemen .pnerally descended from 3 eclockto half-past in the mornmng, and after they, came out and reported that aliwas right the colliers were allowed to desoend, but not before., Daring the day it vws the duty of -the firemen -to examine the -air-ways. If during their examination- early in -the morning they discovered any gas in the stalls, they were to pnt cross timbers as-asignal that therewlasd dagr,andio prevent-the entrace, of the eoliers. After deacriain d the s vfety-sthnae nsed, *5 |mentioned in the evidence of Mxt g na stausein tht the colliers were perfectly aware of their nature, the 'witness stated that the fireman changed their districta every Several of the jurymen here complained that they could not understand the witness so well in theE;nglsh as in the Welsh language, in consequence of -which some portions' of the evidence -were given inr bth. - r I xamination resumed.-There were three districts, GriffithWilliamss-heading was inthe second.

Sir,-Yourleading aricle of.i-day on the subject of lron,don Locomotion" appears to bioach a questionivbicb, I doubt not, has already flashed arrosa the minds of hundeds, without, as in my own case, resolving itself into any very defin: te form, and youe. will probablypermitm me t&bffrer n-few words i continuation. Let the matter be -but cne Ld before ti hovublic in the right way-that 1ia by a lIowng hi, be canvassed for a fesw daynin your cohins-and we shill very sEon soee whether:any real impediments exist in 2th3proseStion of the sclseme alluded to in your umnbr of Io-day. This I conceive to be ,the uniting together of the cief extreme points of the metropolis by a series of welldAanned rail or tram ways to caay. roomy anad easily-accebile omnibuses between certain-fsed halting-places, and at arther 3moreaccelerated speei thanthat acbievedbithepre-ent system. Where the existing thoroughfare is teo nirrow for the admission of a double line of tramway alongside the horse-road it vill be founidnwecaar to establish passingplaces, or "sidings," at convenient intervals. Starting points or intermediate depts wvill be also essential at such itmes as are offered by the more opmen ground at St. Paul's Te'd of Clnnon-street), St Clements Dane', Trafalgarsquare, andlTottenharn-court-road, oit the west; and Shoreditch and Whitechapel churches, Borough-ro-ad, ia- on the tat and south. Dangerous crossings, where the tuimd foot p:tssenger, to avoid a meteoric " Hansom," now rushes to 'lie curb through' a sea of black mud, or runs breath'lely ln and out among the slower but equally formidable host of i?icikfords," and other heavy merehandise vans, wiIl under .:nliinaproved system, probably lose half their -tefitrs; btl should the increased speed of the contemplated tirmwa omnibus be cited as an additional source of risk and danger to the pedestrian, then erect, at the most difficult points, as at the Hanslon-hoise, the bottom of Ludgate-hill, -c., light foot bridges of iron, of suitable headivay, to unite the foot :paveraents, which, combining good taste with economy, Wiill offer a perfectly safe means of transit to the tipid and :ag4e and may, while highly ornamental, be made even a ource of profit, without offering, the least impediment t 'frae circulation on either road or pathway. .Objeotionawill, doubtless, suggest themselves it Snow-hil andLudgate-hi][4 buttheEnglishengiinerof thepresent da; has ead to recognizethe term wihich, inthe infancy of raiL way practice, cu9hionedrmany a noble scheme.

He -lad no doubt that the decesed had inflicted the wourid-himself, and that he had lain down for the purpose.. The 'sedow of the deceased stated that her late husband was a -'nan of very reserved and pecoliarhabits, and since he ilnd: ~sidthe deposit upon the business he was about to: enter -mperi appeared very dejected, and expressed Iis fears that would not answer, and that heshouldbring her to poverty.

The' bishop maks no allusioh to the colleges, or schools of tie State, whose constitution- is independent of 'those whs direct- them immediately. ' It-is a. great misfortune, he thinks, that the State, contrary *to his constant opinion, 5bhould compel the admission of members of all sects of-religien into it8 houses of education. - But, on the other hand, when an institution is free, -h urges. an.d ha especially has ia view certain gizls-schools-namely, at Bohlbgne and St. Omer, whera the. person who is its p'o nrietor and direefress kws the pcwer of putting it into vrhat_ ever conditions- she please, both in respect to the exercises (religious), the stedies, the metAod, and the personal sup+r -intendence; and when- the instructress of youth receives into the society ef children, who are Catholics lika nerself Protestant girls, to whom 'he Dromises to give, or to cause Io be given, a complete Proestant education;when, inriact, these pobr bereties (texual) a.e obliged, by the express-. and -ebutinuAlvwill of the C.holic directress, to:learn the' he'tical - cateehism,- to. study heretical blooks, -t attend the -hereticrl temple,- in suchw thlat she childrea woidldbh Ireaking the rules of tho hoase if they did not o -so- the bishop asks himself, first,, if such a person, habituslly co-' operatingin such reprehensible a hs, can still be admitted to the sacraments of Ged's Holy Church; second y if it*s not' the duty of pastors of - souls to keap, by every leOitimate -meas CatholEc children from the sehotest 'approrcdh fo -these deadly (funestes) tstablssnents. Enough of this lengthy pastoral has beei given to-show intericly infolerant -soirit.

It hs g4ien greatpm an or a pain, 'to manyconscientious schcolmistresses, themselves sincere disciples of Rou&, but who-still wish to fulfil their duty to the parents of chidr-n of other creedls. It- has roused a storm of indiguation among persons connected with the' instruction of yosth througbthie?as-de-Calais. Trueeit is that there arepob' threeother bishops in France who would affii thegna- turo and their sign Of the cross to such a parsecuting'ddc'cumient; but the point which concerns us is that M6rs6igdenr Parisiss see is the onle wherein alm6st-all the mixe4 schools receiving English children are situate.

Sir,-Is it not surprising that so voluminous a writer as Sir Archibald Alison, in his address to the Seaham Mechanics' Listitute, reported in your paper of this day, should showhimself tobe so little versedin political economy as to state-L That if the ailver-ndles of America had not beena discovered three centuries ago, "profits would have been diminished," whereas a schoolboy of the present day would tell him that, although the profits in silver coin would have been smaller, the real profits would have remaimed the same, inasmuch as the smnaller amount of coin would command the same amount of commodities as a larger amount of coin would have done before the workdng of the mines? 2. That the application of steam power to production would have entailed misery, desolation, and ruin on the population of the world but for the discovery of gold in California and Austrslia ? Surely, Sir ArchibaldAlison made this assertion-asmanyassertions aremadeoff-handatpbolicmeetings---ithoutthought. Gold is but a representative of value; abundance of it lowers the value of commodities and of labour; but, in the same ratio, he who receives less coin for his commodities and labour, can, in his turn, command more commodities and 1,4- s-W- M-q An a eit is T rp.mpin- R,r- ?ran -l4i.+ oB3 ' eOIMCAL OE66iONuS2M. yTaven-tl-gazdens, Aug. 14.
I sTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to point out one or two inaccuracies in your leader of to-day on the San Francisco Vigilance Committee, which, if not corrected,might lead to the belief that the Vigilance Committee was at variance with the Federal authorities which is not, nor is it likely to be, the case. The arms which were conveyed in the vesselboarded by the Vigilant police were the property of the State (deposited only with the 'UnitedStates' General, Wool), and were delivered on a requisition by the governor into the custody of those still calling themselves State officers, and from whom they were wrested by the committee's police. The FederalGeneral,Wool, refosed his assistauce tothe State authorities, deeming the action of the committee an internal political revolution with which the Federal authorities had no rightto interfere, and I hear the President has since confitmed him in his view of the case. Again, Judge Terry (a State, not a Federal judge) drew hlis knife upon Hopkins, the " Vigilant's" marshal, before a shot was iired, and then made off to a place occupied by State mailitia, not Federal troops. Judge Terry acted in supportof the State officers, of which he was one. The Federal Government is far from requiring spaport in Calif6rnin. It relies on that aneration for the UTnion and its framers which exists in- the heart of every citizen of the State now represented by the " Vigilance Committee." I beg to enclose my card, and am, Sir, Your ohedient se.-t, AN OLD RESIDENT OF AITTOR.T?NTA Aug. 14.

The .ltoidAgicultural Imnprovement Societyheld their annual cattle snow at Athione yesterday. Owmng to the very uinfavourable stat&~ of 'the. weathler during the e'a'rlier part of. the day, ~t1i attenldanlce of visitors wras rather meagre, but-subsequently. the rain having ceased, the show-yard rapidly filled with crowds of spectators from all parts of Ireland. The exhibition of stock of all kinds is descibed a being gsuuallyfine. The fimi prize in short-horned bulls, calved between Jaiianary, 1851, and 1854, was awarded to Giand Turk, belonging to Mlr. Henry Ambler, of Watlijohall,3Halifax. LordClancarty's shclrt-horned roaxi bull, Yiro :3ono publico; took the second prize' The Lord-lieutenant was present, and in the course of the day a congratulatory address was presented by the town commnissioners, to which his Excellency replied as follows:. - ' -- "Gentleinen,-1 begto return my sincere thanl;s to th6 Commissioners of Atblone for the expressions nalike of reqsectful -loyalty and- friendly welcome with which they have greeted me on mn visit to their ancient borough. -Its old and- almost pre-historical-nnse of Ath-Luann,or 'the Ford of -L;n,' the scene of many a struggle between conflicting tribes and jealons races4 affords a striking contrast to the spectacle it now presents, when, as the centre of the inland Co.munication of the kingdom, it has brought thit large and peaceful concourse of its inhabitants together to witness the bloodless triumphs of agricultural industry. X trust that your commnnity will ever entertain the noble resolution of keeping dut pace withthe manifold idvantages of your local position and'the geneal improvement and progress of Ireland." - The banquet took place in the evening. The Duke of Leinster, as president of the society, presided, and the guests comprised the Lord-Lieutenant, the Earl of Erne, Lord Monek, Lord Talbot de Ma'ahide, Lord Clancarty, L-ord 'Clonbrock, Lord Caztlemaine, Lord Clifton, Sir.T. Redinaton, Judge |eoghli and many of. the leading gentay of WestI-meath, 1oscommon, and tha neighbouring counties. The usua loyal toasts having -been given and;Tesponded to, " The Health of the' Lord Iieutenmt" was proposed amid great cheering. His Excellency replied at considerable lengthi and, inter asa; asupplied some highly interesting facts connected with the annual return of agricGlturi statistics which *bave not yet been officially promulgated by the Registrar-General. After alluding to the historic recollections attached to the. :oli town of Athlone, the central garrison of Ireland, Lord Carlisle proceeded as follows --. -:- II "Where could we have placd Irish agriculture upon a morebefittingthrone? lNor 'ars there-wantingsomevery gratifying points of contrast wi th the tunes that have passed7 eway. This same majestic Shannon formerly separated Connaultgh almost as a distinct country from the rest of Ireland. Sometimes, indeed, Connanght was represented as beingone side of a less political alternative Qaughter and applause), vad this very year the most brilliant of historiass has described to uS how that inhabitants of the same realm. guarded these lines, and watched these fords, and reddened thes plains in deadly conflict. (Hear, hear.) Now this same stream washes the confines of ten peaceful Irish counties and benefits them all, and, as on this day, brings together a lrge unarmed assembly to meet in peaceful lists -where there is no more destructive rivalry thauthat between polUed Anguses and Xerzies. (Cheers.) While on the subject of this great river, I mva state 3much pains have been taken of late years to heighten its natural cPapbilities by improving the navigation and by diminisbing the overflow of its banks, to which it was so much subiect; and I am not sure vhether -our great Imperial ally might not borrow sone very useful hints from us as to how to deal with these disastrous inmudations, which on a larger scale have so recently occurred on the banks of the Loire and the Rhone. (Cheerm) But with respect to ourselves, this deepening of the channel of rivers and strengtheng of their courses, and - tho reduction of their waters to their summer level, prepare the way most usefully for t'horotugh drainage, and I rejoice to find how much of that beneficial work is going on over Ireland ger,erally. (" Hear" and cheers.) I have learned thatsince 1848no less than 176,000 acres have been. drained by the Board of Works, and I imagine more than double that area bypri- vate hands; and sub-soil draining and surface drainig on mountain lands have been -attended with like benelcial results to the upland farmer and grazier. Now, I need not point out to the practical and snlightened men who now surround me how all-importart drainage mnst be to a country lhke Ireland, where the insular climate must necessarily cau7se so great an abundance of moisture (hear, hear), and where we cannot always rely on the brilliant sunshine With vhich we were favoured during the last fortnight. Nor can I be debarred, even by the golden promise of the harvest which now gladdens our eyes; from uTging you to bear in mind that what.Naturo in her wise economy seems specially to have fitted this island for is to be the m7other of flocks and herds-to be, if I nay so say, the herd and the day. of the world-to send zations of beef and bales of bacon to our armies wherever they are, whether they are of ?seihfg, upon the distant ridg^, Ort7'thMd,S1Wdl to send 6rldns of butter to every sea and harbour of the habitable globe. (Hear, hear.) Within the Lat 20 years more than a mfllion of Irish acres have been reclaimed from the waste. Tn 1841 to eight millionsof people there were 13,000,000 of cultivated acres in Irelnd Now perhaps morethan a million has been subtracted from the population, and more than a million acres has been added to the cultivated area (Hear, hear.) I wish, however, nottodeal in generalities on a subject of this sort, but will confiine myself to the actual progress as Contrasted between the pres_nt year and that which isumediately preceded it. I derive my information from the very valuable returns eollected by tlie constabulary of this country; and this is a matter in which I conceive that you ir Ireland have got a mnaterial start over your proud neighiious. in England. These returns, as you are well aware, are eollected annually, and, be it spdoken tothe great credit of the Irish gentry, farmers, and people, they are furnished voluntarily, and rare indeed are the instances in Mhich the information requested is not supplied with alacrity and good wlL (Cheers.) Well, Tfimd from these returms, which have noÂ§ yet been given to the public-the time has not yet arrved fortheirlbeing sufficiently maturedforthepurposeI find that, comparing this year with the last, there is a decrease of some amount in the growth of oats and barley, but there is an increase in the growth of wheat of 83,683 acres. The increase in green crops amounts to no less than 114,774 acres; and, though I must admit potatoes are by far the largestportion, yet I amin hopesthatjpotatoesthemselves are grown nov; more as a farmer's crop'than with a view to the exclusive subsistence of the cottier. {Cheers.) The increase in flax, which I am es ecialy glad to learn, covers90,000 acres, and theincrease of thewholeextentundertillage thisyear,as compared with the last, amounts to 65,773 acres (Hear.) So, with respect to live stocl-, the increase in the number of horses amounts to 18,000; of head of cattle to 25,000, of the number of sheep to 90,000. There is a very large decrease observable in pigs, amounting to no less th m u0,000; but it is thought by those who are charged with the ollection of these returns that this is owing to their having been made up at an earlierperiod than usual, for I believe the farmers fenerally like to have their pigs to feed when they have the largest quantity of actnalproauce to give them. However, that is a matter which must be tested by subsequent experience. I have the pleasure of seeing o%posite to me on this occasion a miost ueful publi officer, Mr. Donnelly, and I cannot see him without remembering that both he and I have together striven to -inculcate how much use it would be to effect a still larger destruction of road-side weeds. I do not like to go over ground which I have travelled before, and I believe and hope much has been done, and is doing in this respect. I know that some railway companies have been good enough to give very useful directions on this head, and Ibelieve both they, and grand juries and road con. tractos, and proprietors at large, might do still more. I do not wish at al to treat even the unproductive pauper as a human wfeed-I should be very sorry to represent him in that light-but I am happy to say that this crop shows a great deficiency as compared with itsstate last year, for, upon iqnuiring the numbers in the workhouses, I am bappy to find that m the last week there were 17,771 fewer than in the same week in August, 1855, and there are 1,571 less last week than the week before. (Hear, hear ) Indeed, there is no circumstance in the present social condition of Ireland -which inspires me with more satidaction than what I believe to be the rise, perhaps the gradual bht the general rise, perhaps the slow, but,- I believe, the certain, and, I trust, the permanent rise, in the rate of WagemAnd if there are any here to whom that has a less comfortable bound, I would invite them to remember that low wages by nomeans alw3ys represent cheap labour (loud- cheers), and: tlhat no re,i or deep-seated or pormanent prosperity can be expeted in the country unlent $ss is grounded upon a prosperous and contented teantry. an labourig cldas; and, le a tha itisthu, mid the harmony of classes~, thp co- operation of interests, the blessings of external peace and internal concord that, Itrust the yalAricultual .Society isdesdtinhed to pursue its honourable anheneietcre (Loud cheering)." andeneficent carer.- The other principal speakers were Lord Erne, Lord Clonbrock, Lord Clancaty, iand IL-.

Wher first the scheme was broached be was surprLed by the vast ness of the conception, for it seemed to him something thai could never be achieved; but the more he had thought ol it, the more had he become convinced that the thing corld be done, and that it would be eminently succesf in al its objects and purposes. Not. only so, bat he believed thaI the amount of money it ,would raise would enable itspro moters to establish some institation for the permanenl benefit ofgenerations to come. (Applause.) This portion of theproceedings was then closed by three hearty cheers for the exhibition and three for the contrac tors.

(Loud cheers.) He regretted thecircumstancethatonly24hours had elapsed since the ceremonyhadbeen resolved upon, and, that the harried arrangementsnecessitatedbycircumstances had prevented invitations being sent to all the subscribers to the guarantee fund, as had been intended. t The toast having been dnly honoured, the Cz.atusRx. proposed "His Ployal Highness Prince Albert," which was drunkwithloudeheers.

I BITSIH ASSOCIATION forc VAEMN IIOF 2CIENXCE. THELTENBN AM, AUG. 14. OzoiXZ OBSERVAnIONS. At the meeting of Section A (Mfathematical and Thysical Science) on Tuesday lst,: Dr. lIx, having laid upon the table a pamphlet by Dr. Barker, on the ozonometers of Dr. Schbgbein and Dr. lof rat, took the opportunity of stating that the comNrative observations, made at the Bedford Observatory, although confirming 4he previous ones, indicated a difference betweeen the test papers of Dr. Schebjin and those of Dr. Mofft. He hop ead that ozone obliervations would be generally entered upon by meteorological observers as so much of mterest belonged to this mysterious agent. It was particularly desirable -that every circumstance accompanying the presence of ozone in the air -should be recorded, and since so greait a'difference between the ozonometes 'of Drs. Sch5bein acnd Moflit had been observed, he (Dr. Lee) would suggest that tbo readings of one. alone should not be reliedlon,, but that i all cases comparative observations should be carried on sith both ozonometers. He was particularly anxiousthat as many meteorologists as possible might be induced to commence ozone observations, in order that they might the sooner arrive at some raore satisaactosy P rvpU ~ 3Â£ moos p peric agent. Dr. lxs also read a paper on a new self-registering mer. curial ninimum thermometer, invented by Mess. Negrtti and Zamba. Dr. Lee exhibiteda the insdtrument to the section, and explained the principle upon which it -was constructed as follows;:-The thermometerha^ a bulb of very large size, consequentlyaflowingatubecorrsponfldinlylai*e intho bore for that pat forming the scale. On the surface of the mercury enclosed in the tube is plaved a small steel needle, pointed at both ends, which forms theindex. This conical needle is capable of moving freely in the bore of the tube, and as the mercury descends therein will of conrse fall withit; but when the mercury ascends in the tube the mercury will pass the lower pointed end of the needle, and rise above the same -%ithout raisin or moing the needle. This latter 'wiji, therfore, rema stationary, and, consequently, its upper point will indicate the lowest temperature to which it has descended during the 12 or 24 hours, andailll no' be affected by any subsequent risein temperature. To reset the thermometer for futuro observations it is necessary simply to tn it in such a position that the mercuryandneedle in the tube will flow into the reservoir at the top; but should the needle not freely flow writh the mercury, it mny be asssted by a magnet, and readily held there until, by re-turning the thermometer to the upright position, the mercury liows bach again into the tube, and then, with the magnet, the neddle maybereturned tothesface of the mercury remAyforfature observations. Dr.Leeobservad, that one of thesethermometers had been in the hands ef the Secretary of the British Meteorological Society - another at the Rloyal Observatory,. Greenwich; a third at ir. E. J. Lowe's observatory, Brgh field-house; and others had been used by various members of the British Meteorological SocietS, all of which had acted most accurately, and in two instances had corrected errors in the alcohol minimms which otherwise woould have passed unnoticed. With the geneial meeting yesterday the business of the association was brought to a conclusion. The thanks of the association were tenderel to the local secreties Capt3in Robertsor, tA., Mr. Beamish, and Mr. Hugall, who have been most indefatigable in their exertions to promote the objects of the great scientific congress. To-day about e0 of the members have been upon a geological excu-sion to Charfieldby the Great Western Railway; another party of about 150proceeded by the Midland lRailway to Chepetow.and its neighbourhood, including the romanticbeauties of the Wye, T,ntern Abbey, &c.; and a third party, numbering about 60, went in carriages, supphied by Mr. Davis from the stables of the Queen's Hote4 to Winchcomb, visiting Sudeleycastle,. Stanway-court, and Toddigton, the residence of lord Sudeley. The day has been exceedingly fine. --and the whole of th e excursionists retursied to Cheltenhas abcut o o'cloc]r. The meeting has, upon the hole, been a. highly succesful one. The number as well as high character of the various papers reat wll bea'r comparison with that of ny previous meetings. y of the papers were of great nterest, and afforded valuable information upon some of the gret political ana social questions ofthe day,andthee can benodoubt that the information aporded has been of a ctical and ieful character.
