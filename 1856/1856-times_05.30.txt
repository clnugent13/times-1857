XOKEN-MABKEITand CITYINTELLIGENXCE. Thursday Evening. The celebration of peace has been signalized today at the Bank of England by the firsr decided Step towards a return to what may be considered a natural rate of discount. The minitnum rate which has stood at 6 per cent. for Short billssince the 18th of October, and whicl for long bills was reduced from 7 to 6 per cent. Dnly last Thursday, is now put dowvn to 5 per tent. for all descriptions. The fact that the recent Influx of bullion and the increase in the reserve of .iotes which will be further promoted to-morrow by the repayment of advances to the amount of nearly 1,000,0001. wouldcause the movement to be almost immediately adopted has been recognized for several days, although it was thought the partial liolyday in the city to-day might lead to its being deferred till the subsequent court. The directors have evidently felt that its bearing upon the large operations of trade was too important to excuse any iesitation on merely incidental grounds, and their promptitude will give general satisfaction throughout the country. With the signs of. continued arrivals of bullion frqm all parts, a probability is suggested that even a further reduction may hefore a long period be found necessary; but prudent persons will hope that the change may not come with extreme rapidity, since the disposition to inflation is obviously ready to burst forth under the slightest stimulus, and there are also threatenings of French and Russian loans of large amount. The discount houses have not yet announced their intention with regard to the reduction to be made in their allowance for money at caU. The London joint-stock banks have aU lowered their rate for deposits one per cent. In the Stock-Exchange this morning, although the transactions were limited, and were brought to a termination at an early hour, some considerable fuctuations took place. Consols for money opened at 95 to ., being an improvement of an eighth on the closing quotation of yesterday, but soongave 'way under the influence of the intelligence from America that President Pierce has resolved to recogmize the Government set up by NWalker and his invading band in Nicaragua. The fall continued uintil they touched 94g, when the notice from the :Bank of the reduction of the rate of discount produced a partial rally. The final operations were at 941 to 7- for money and the 4th of June, and 951 (or 94 ox. dividend) for the account on the 10th of July. The scrip of the new loan closed at 2t to - premium. B1ank Stock left off at 216 to 217; Meduced, 93; to E; New Three per Cents., 94{ to ;; Annuities, 30 years, 17i ; India Stock, 233 to 235; India Bonds, 4s. discount to Dar; Exchequerboonds, 9Si to 99; and Exchequer-bldls (March), 2s. to 5s. premium ; June, 3s. discount to par. Foreign securities were fairly supported, although the amount of business was not extensive. Transactions took place in Turkish Six per Cents. at 99 and 99- for money, and 99j4 ; and j for the account; and in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, at 1031 for money, and 103% for the account. 3Iexican Three per Cents, were negotiated at 23k, , and 1 for money, and 23&1 and 1 for the account. The general business eomprised Portuguese Four per Ceitts., for the account, 51-; Russian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 9GX ; Spanish Three per Cents., 46j and -; the New Deferred, 25- and ,-; Spanish Certificates 6- and , per cent.; Belgian Four-and-Half per Cents., 9G; Dutch Two-and-aElalf per Cents. 64Q ; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 9s. The fiiial quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 75f. for money, and ,of. 20c. for the account, showing no material alteration, but still a tendency to dulness. At Amsterdam and rienna there continues to be an absence of animation. In almost all the general departments of trade today there was a complete suspension of business, so far as such an arrangement was possible without the concurrence of the Goveranient. The dissatisfaction at the inconvenience sustained through the non-compliance with the wish of the leading commercial establishments that the day should be legalized as a holyday by the passage of an act, which would also have met any public occasions for the future, was strongly expressed in every quarter.
PAILIFAY INTELLIGENCE. IEEDS. ATRMFWORT) AxnTT rAT.TVAC TT-T'-rTw The report of the directors of this company states that the railway during the past quarter has been worked with regularity and order, and that there is a manifest improvemnent in the development of the traffic of the district. As compared with the corresponding quarter in last year, the revenue account shows an increase in the receipts for passenger traffic of 4521., and in goods traffic of G601. The directors recommend a dividend to be paid after the rate of 6 per cent. per annum; to accomplish which will require the sum of 6931. from the reserve fund, and which fund was established for the purpose of regulating the l)aylnent of dividends. From the report of the comipaniy's engineer it may be expected that the Gildersome branch will be opened during the month of July. The directors have been some time making preparations for that event, and they trust the shareholders and the public will alike paiticipate in the important advantages which will result from it. iMir. S. CL.u;KE, the general mlanager, reports the continuedgood order of the line, and that nothing has happened during the last three nontbs to impede the punctual niid proper wvorking of the local traffic. The coal traffic from the Gildersome branch will commence prior to the 2iext meeting, and he trusts that the increase of business from that source vwill fully answer the expectations of the slhreliolders. The capital account to the 31st of March last shows that :37-3,6241. had been received, and 363,1711. expended, leaving a balance of 10,4.'VK. The revenue account for the quarter ending the 31st of March amoumted to 4,8161., and the expenses to 2,3601., leaving a balance applicable to dividend of 2,4561. The reserve fund amounts to 2,7121., out of *wlich 693t. is taken for the purpo3e of adding to the balance --pplicabIe to dividend, malcing 3,1:501., reqniired for the proposed dividend at the rate of 6 percent. per annum.

The follovwing are the principal items in the Director's report, wt'ch was untanimously adopted by the Meeting:- At the last annual mneeting your Directors had the pleasure of being al le to state, that the progress of the Afsodation, since 151, hadbeent tonsiderably be3ond their expectations, having advaiced from 731 rolicies. in that year, to 1,177 in 1852; to 1,315 ir. 1853, and to 1.336 in 1354; while the sums assnred had increased fromn Ã¯Â¿Â½110.600 in 1851, to Ã¯Â¿Â½186.000 in 1852, to Ã¯Â¿Â½198,oO0 in 1853. and to Ã¯Â¿Â½227,0;D in 1854. hliey are now able to report, that the bus;nes, of 18i55 has far exceeded that of any previous year. No less tban 2.100proposalswere accepted in the Tenmperance aud General Sections alone, for sums amounting to 307,00, of which 1881 policies were completed, repre.-nitiDg assurances totbe amount of Ã¯Â¿Â½275,.C0, being 529 policies more than vece hsued in IS54, and the amrount assured was Ã¯Â¿Â½48,380 beyond that of any previous year. But the progress of the Instilution since the Ist January. 1856. haa ceen stDIl uore gratifying.

At the close of ISI the accumulated capitalof the Anssoiation, as shovwn by the certif ed balance sheet, was Ã¯Â¿Â½118,4880s., and the annual income 9"'0.068 7s. 7d., showing an increase in she capital over that or I854 to the extent of Ã¯Â¿Â½21,79314s., and intheiicomeof Ã¯Â¿Â½11,150. The capital may now beset down at upwards o; i1I0,000, and the incOme at Ã¯Â¿Â½5:.00&s. lVith regard to claims, the number arising from the deceae of memnbers nas been 65, and the amount claimed Ã¯Â¿Â½13,705.

Experience has ftlly proved that the most efficient rode of extendit,g life asnurance bisiness is by means of active agents, and during the past year your Directors have aippointed no less than 171, many of vwhonu already give promlse of being very successful. But itis to the Actuary's Report your Directors would particularly invite attention, which is as foll ,ws:- To the Chairman and Board of Directors ok the United Xingdom Tem. e erance audGeneral Provident Institution. Gentlemn.-.I bhve tbe honour to report the completion of my second citinquxennial investigation into the affairs of the Unitd Ringdont Temperance and General Provident Institution. and to submit my valuation herewitb, extending over upwards of 8,00D policies, and 11 different depawtments or plans of assurance. It gives me ver grcat satisfaction to be able to report to the di rectors and members, that the Society isat this time iii a most sound and prosperous condition, as will bebest evinced by the divisible scuplts of the Society on tle 31st of December last. It will be in the recollection of. the memsbers on the occasion of the last valuation in 1850, that the directors acting on my advice, did not consider it expedient at tbattimse to declare y bonum or addition to the policies lalthouch the Soeietyas in athoroolgblysound and sa tisfactory condition, end wvasin possession of a reatired surpluy), feelingn convinced that by allowving another quinquennial per.od to elapse without dividing, the bonus wvould not only be much larger in amount, but that increased stability would be rciven to the Society. Th-e wiisdom of this act of forbearance is nowf amply justified and irllstrated by the large and handsome bonus w,hich the Society is at the present dlivisionenabledto declare safely, on the polices of its members.-abhonns, accordingto age, rangisgftrou S4 tol5 per eent. on the amount of presnilima paid under Dep.ortmuent 1; and from 23 to1 un tder department 9. In Departments 2, 10. and li. lbs bonus, although bighly satisfactory, and emply sufficent to indicate the prosperity of these departments, could not of necesity be exrpected lobe ro large as in other departments, inasmuch as from the part.icular nature of the assurances effected under thesne casses, a greater amount of rese.-ve is sequitred to be k'eptback in the coffers of the Society, in order to meet the more immediate liabitities entailed by them. It is also to be borae in muind that man,y of these polic-ies fall due at 10. 81, 60. ana 65, and are shout to become immediatelypayable, thus depriving the classe to which they belong of large snums, just as their aceuntulation at conmou nd intereitwasbecoming more and more imnportant. In Departmuents 3 to 8 inclusive, as the benefits assured under thems hlave been granted at the low est possible rates of premium, no surplus w,hatever conl be reasonably expected. ThEe Society hass nowv in force upw ards 8.000 policies: it has asqsured auras equal tol 250,t00 * and has a clear annual income, fromu premiumns nictie, of about .s4.t0d l ean, wvith the most perfect confidence, assure the Directors andihe BIenshera that the benaus now deslared, regsarded as a whEole, is quits as large as that declared by the great majority olf other prudently conducted Assurance (hfices, and muuch larer in amount than that declared by ninnyothers within the same interal of time, I can alsodvie the DXirectors and Mtembers sesumnos, that the a}mount of profit about to be divided has been fairly reatired in the past tranmaotiona oi the Society, and in no way includes futulre or anticipated prOfits. I therefore venture te predict, that if the Society, during the next sueceedin'- five years; makes the same extraordinary progreasswhich it has done d&uing the last Sve. and is conducted wvith the same sted psudence sadq saacity. that the bonito will be declared on the occasiso of the next division wvhich will, if possible, give even greater satisfaction than 5.le present oueshou ls do.

SAGACrIT OF A DOG.-Early on Sunday morning thieves attempted to enter the premises of Messrs. l'Leod and Pollock, jewellers, Argyll-street, by breaking through the skvlight window. The building is one story in height, and it is a comparatively easy matter to ascend to the roof. About 2 o'clock Mr. ?'Leod, who resides in the back premises, was awakened from his sleep by his watchdog. The animal did not bark, but jumped npon the bed and continued to scrape on Mr. AI'Leod's body til he rose up. The dog then uttered a low growl, and loolked towards the roof, as If anxious to draw his master's attention to that particular direction. Imumediately afterwards a portion of a pane of glass fell on the floor; and. on Mr. MI'Leol looking towards the ceiling he observed a man on the roof. The police being acquainted with the circumstances, they caught a labourer named Wiliam hl'Nalught on the roof, before he was able to conceal hiuself. Another person, who was standing near the premises, was also apprehexsded,-Glaegoo C71renucc.

LONDOiV, FRIDA Y, MAY 30, 1856. It is a very old remark that in the streets of London everybody seems bent on urgent busincss. Considering the intent look of every passenger, the old stories of men who knew by heart every shop from Charing-cross to the Bank are hard to be believed. Yesterlay, for once, the streets from a very early hour were full of people, who had evidently no other business than to look about them and be pleased. A very large infusion of the provincial element added to the freshmess and gaiety of the ever flowing stream, and there was even something of a rustic bloom about it. There wanted only the varieties of semi-barbarous attire that MLziTAr. describes in the frequenters of the Roman spectacles, or the quaint costumes still to be found at a Sunday flte at Paris. Still one saw that all England was there well represented. There were schoolboys enjoying a day's holyday, and schoolgirls walking with fathers, uncles, and cousins. The pleasures of anticipation often exceed 'those of enjoyment, and, bearing this in mind, everybody was employed in studying the preparations for the night, and imagining how they would look. It does not take very long to go throughl the devices, which certainly do not speak much for the fecundity of British invention. WVe are bound to confess that the schools of art and design have not borne much fruit, if this is all the crop. There were stars innumerable; crowns many; heaps of laurel branches ; some Royal arms; " V.R.'s" enouagh to satisfy the most romantic lover of Royalty; "V.A.'z" not a few; a select variety of mottoes; transparencies of Peace, England and France, Victory, and such simple ideas; " Sebastopol," " Alma, " and " Balaldava. " These were all well studied, and not less the desperate efforts of the gasmen and oilmien, and glassmen, and tinmen, with waggons full of mysterious implements and jars; and ladders that would not reach, and pipes that would not fit. Happily both the sum and the clouds did their duty-the former by not shining too fiercely, the latter by not discharging their contents. The Parks, of course, were very early visited, and at noon looked as gay as ftey usually do on a fine Sunday at 4 o'clock. -'ere-waa a most wonderful variety of construe- tions prepared for the night; some like tha scaffoldings which conventionally represent the building of the Temple; some like gymnastic apparatus, or the instruments of suspension and selftorture used by the Fakirs, others simply like gibbets, windmills, signposts, railway signals, or the rigging of Chinese junks. Most delightful they were to gaze upon, instinct with fire, and life, and hope. Like the prizes of social life, or the institutions of one's country, they stood charged w ith power and full of promise. How they would soon blaze away; what glory, what coruscations, what hues; how soaring, how sublime ! For the present, indeed, they looked mere anatomies; but the dry bones would soon start into life and motion. But everything about a holyday is deliglhtful, even portmanteaus and hatboxes, direction labels, and foiur-wheeled cabs. But even all this preparation would not fill up the day. It began with an inspection on the Parade, which, as might be supposed, was well attended by the "roughs." Then, at 1, the guns fired, and carried the sweet sound of a holyday to many a back parlour and many a sick bed. Then there came the Drawing-room. All over the Westend, and even in remote regions, carriages were standing at aristocratic or official doors, with servants in the gayest of liveries. Little crowds gathered to see the result, and found their anticipations more or less realized in it. It was a lottery, in which the blank was a dowager or a uiiform, the prize that combination of beauty, grace, dignity, and sweetness, which is found nowhere as in noble or gentle England. Then, all these carriages, having received their gorgeous or their beauteous freights, bowled along, to the admiration of the country folk, and fell into long ranks, where the inmates had to stand the more deliberate scrutiny of curious gentlemen well versed in the peerage, or ladies who in an instant of time could analyze the whole of a complicated dress. However, it uwas a very beautiful procession. Thiis, too, had its chief feature, which was the progress of HER MAWIJESTV, the PmsNcEss RoYAL, and, if report speak true, her future husband, to St. James's. As the day wore on, the vast wondering, gazing, inquiring, talking, and laughing mnltitude, whether from prudence or fatigue, flagged and thinned,-resting and refreshing themselves at all sorts of odd places and hours. Then came the great event of the day. Of all human mimicry and artifice there is nothing more beautiful than fireworks, nothing liker the glory of the heavens, the fury of volcanoes, or the splendoiur of meteors. They alvays suprise, and dull indeed must be the memory on which they do not leave a life impression. You may see a thing every day of your life, and not know it so well as the magic figures and hues flashed on your eye thirty years ago in the darkness of the night, you almost forget wlhen and where. Contrary to some anticipations, everybody saw well and co0nfortably; everybody was delighted; and everybody had the feeling that it was one bill of fare for all,for the QUEEN and for the humblest of her subjects. We all saw how the day passed. Nobody can deny that London, and England too, did herself credit on the day. The whole population turned out, and submitted to inspection, and showeed themselves to advantage. There was difference enough-too great difference, perhaps-of classes. But, at all events, there were no dormant volcanoes, no smouldering fires, no great lurking disease, no angry interchange of frowns and scowls, no looks of defiance on foreign masters, or timid glance at the agents of despotism. There is hardly a man -if, indeed, there is a man-in this metropolis who might not walk about ticlketed with his name and address in perfect safety, at all events, however singular such a proceeding might appear. Even they wlho express opinions at variance with those of the majority, and conflicting with their ideas of comfort or justice, enjoy entire toleration. There may be a very strong opinion indeed of the excess, or the deficiency, or the cost, or the uselessness of this or that institution, but the feeling does not extend to the persons concenmeeL There is not a place, so as it be not a den of thieves, in this metropolis, where a Peer, or a Bishop, or a FieldMarshal might not show himself and be received with the respect due to his position. There is none of that bitter envy that poisons and corrupts some communities in Europe. Here was a reunion of classes, in which the preservation of peace and good order was left to natural feeling, as the event proved, with success. We may not be so ready at organization as some nations; we do not play much at soldiers; we are too independent in our ways, being come, as people say, of too many races and sects and schools. But we can agree to disagree; and we do not obtrude our quarrels where they have no right to be. More than that, we can easily give up our differences to find a ground for mutual congratulation. How many, for example, have been preaching, lately that the peace is not worth a rejoicing ! They who thought so may or may not have changed, but it is evident that all the metropoEs was yesterday unanimous. All joined in the festivity, for one reason or another; if for no other, because they saw that everybody else was well pleased.
We have had lately no lack of comparisons between England and France. It would be useless to deny that the continental world is disposed to give the first place in Europe to our allies rather than to ourselves. lIow much of this preference is just-how much is a deduction from a comparatively small series of facts-we, a reflective and by no means vain people, can easily appreciate. England is a country isolated in institutions, manners, and habits of thouglht, as well as in geographical position. Our law is an indigenous system, owing little to ancient or Papal Roome; our political administration depends on the existence of classes which have elsewhere perished, or never come into being. Our habits and amusements are not those of the continental peoples. Everything, from Lisbon to the heart of Russia, is now modelled on a French plan. Every man endeavours to be the duplicate of the Parisian in dress, behaviour, and ideas; he arranges his house, chooses his society, and plans his amusements, according to the standard of taste in Paris. Children are brought up to speak the French language as their own, and the next generation promises to be more completely French than any which has preceded it. The decay of vigour and originality in the continental nations is tending to make them in all that regards civilization mere dependencies of France, which, with its polished and accurate language, its exquisite taste, and great power of communicating ideas, has the ear of theni all, gives its own account of everything that happens, and tells to each all that they know of each other or of the world at large. But, while this sameness spreads over Europe, and every continental capital is becoming I merely an inferior Paris, our English nation keeps to its own ways, which are infinitely I diverse from those of foreign visitors. Everything in this country is intended for Englishmen, and Englishmen alone. The foreigner finds here-! neither amusement, companionship, nor sympathy. There are few public recreations, and our private society, if even accessible to him, has ideas and standards of its own, which are a mystery to the stranger. We cannot wonder, therefore, that throughout Europe the unpreparedness and the temporary disasters of England in the late war should be contrasted with the successes of France, and the world find a pleasure in comparisons to, the discredit of the nation which they do not understand or love. So far from boasting, it is the customii of Englishmen rather to paint their country in dark colours, and to corroborate unfavourable criticisms by the severity with which they censure all they find to blame in themselves, their rulers, or their institutions. M. MoNTALrr.NmBEnT recently remarked a novel tendency in our people to the deification of power, and it cannot be denied that recent events have led a few weak and unstable minds to admire the strength of concentrated authority, the swift ness and steadiness with which it can act, and the boldness with which it crushes cavilling or remonstrance. Such persons have had their say, and the value of their observations tinie will show. At all events, we have no inclination to renew the schoolboy discussion whether despotisms or republics can best carry on war. But we may point out one advantage o' freedom, publicity, and popular government. After all, the internal state of nations is morj important than their influence abroad, and, even allowing that the submission of the people ani the silence of the press may permit the mors speedy concentration of regiments and siege-trains at a certain point, still something is due to the consideration whether such a social condition is conducive to general security, or is even a sure foumdation of national power. Our Paris correspondent's letter, published yesterday, gave a description of the actual state of France. In this hour of victory, congratulation, and fameat this apogee of Imperial greatness-we hear again the name of Socialism. The disease is, we learn, not dead, uor has it even slept; it has only been forgotten. Am;d the roar of cannon, amid combat and rejoicing, amid the debates of diplomatists and the compliments of corporations, it has crept unnoticed from village to village, followed the course of roads and rivers wlherever traffic has brought men of the lower ranks together, outwitted the restrictions of passports and the vigilance of the magistracy, and now covers vast districts of France, from the borders of Germany and Italy to the Atlantic. Paris and Lyons are, as of old, the centres of revolutionary impulse. Ln the latter city the multitude has during three generations been noted for its anarchical doctrines, its readiness for an appeal to arms, and its desperate courage in the face of trained soldiers. Now it is the head-quarters of the party who stiU use the word " revolutionf' in its old sense, not as vaguely representing liberty or equality, or brotherhood, or a free career for all, but as embodying the principles of MAD.AT and the machinery of RoBEsPIErrs. There are Socialists and Communists who are more than republican, who would look on a commonwealth like that of the 'United States or the Swviss Cantons as worse than despotism, because it tends to inculcate a cowardly moderation. WVe learn that this moral disease has its geographical distribution. In France, as in other continental countries, locomotion is not free to the laborious classes. The Englishman who travels for a hundred leagues without being asked for his passport is apt to consider the system a mere formality, troublesome, no doubt, but much exaggerated as to its restrictive results. The artisan or peasant could tell a different tale. The effect of the passport regulations is to bind large classes to the districts in which they were born, and it is singular to find that, whereas perfect freedom of traveling and the consequent intermixture of the population would break down the ignorance on which revolutionary doctrines are based, the small intercourse that prevails is subservient to the spread of the evil. The chief agents of the Central Propaganda are the unsettled race whose occupation carries I them up and down the great rivers, the Rhone, the Loire, the Saone, and the Yonne. Wherever raftsmen and bargemen come, the peasantry hear something against the rich and the aristocrats, learn the names of Ci OOTZ and BAXBtS and Louis BL&NC, are told that they want bread because tyrants have taken more than their share, that a time of deliverance is coming, but that to be successful they must unite, and, above all, learn to be secret and to enforce secrecy on others. Communism and Republicanism follow the course of the great rivers and the main roads of the country. Even in certain trades and callings different political views prevail, showing how all the doctrines are communicated from man to man in the companionship of the work-shop or the cebaret, and not derived from the teachings of any book or newspaper or favourite demagogue. The secret societies which overspread the infected districts of course preserve a passive attitude, waiting for the orders they may receive from Paris, Lyons, or Marseilles; the great cities are filled with soldiers, and no man dares to take the initiative. Perhaps the whole network of conspiracy may some day be destroyed, perhaps material prosperity may lessen discontent, perhaps the slow progress of reason may convince even famine and raggedness that relief cannot come by rebellion and pillage. But what a state of things is this after the repression of seven years ! Can we want a clearer proof that " strong goverm" ment," irresponsible, powerful in all the means of coercion, cannot deal as it would even with silk-weavers, blacksmiths, and vine-growers ? Wrhy has this country now no dangerous classes? Why may a million of people freely congregate in this unguarded metropolis, or in the neighbourhood of Manchester or Glasgow ? England has a denser population, a more inclement climate, less natural fertility than France or Germany or the Italian States ; yet amid many privations there is no political discontent, no hatred of class against class. It was indeed not always so, even in the memory of men now living and taking part in affairs. Once in our own country there was a notion among statesmen that they ought to extirpate sedition, and consequently there was never wanting sedition to extirpate. They were determined to cuirb "the excesses of the press," and the result was that those excesses grew wilder and more frequent every day. Another plan has been tried of late years. Full publicity, full freedom of speech, association, and locomotion have been the rule during the last 25 years, and in that time we have seen every secret society, every scurrilous print, every antisocial doctrine pass away, with the criminal informations and wholesale arrests which were supposed to repress them. Every one who has listened to a foreign demagogue is aware of the absurdity and mysticism of the views whicl he would see prevail by the most violent means. Such harangues as have been received vwith applause in continental Chamlbers within the last eight years would have failed to convince a mob in the Tower Hamlets. Why has the Socialist adventurer in this country always the fear that some plain man will rise in the body of the meeting and tear to pieces all his arguments ? Because every mar has, through reading or enlarged intercourse, the power of hearing both sides of a question, and men of sound judgment are sure to be found in every assemblage acquainted with the question debated. A Royal Prince observed at the beginning of this war that representative institutions were on their trial. We think they bave been tried, and not foiud wanting. Duringf the last few years a class of Englishmen has been found to recommend, at two different periods, the foreign plan of secrecy and repression. They would have combated the remonstrances against an unjust comrAercial system in peace and, an incapable Administration in war by the enforcement of silence and submission. But such a spectacle of tranquillity as England now presents is a suflicient vindication of the system which national good sense has established, and we recommend it to the consideration of both foreign and domestic detractors.
We learn upon no mean authority that roast pig was discovered by the burning down of a house, and that to obtain this delicacy in perfection it was for ages deemed essential to set a house on fire. Glorious as was the result, one cannot nowa-days help thinking that the mode of attaining it was rather expensive; it was, indeed, nearly as extravagant as the price which another great authority declares that we must pay in order to obtain perfect safety in railway travelling-nothing less than the smashing of a bishop. In all soberness, however, it is in this extravagant fashion that we purchase all our great improvements. Not onlly must a bishop be smashed before railways are made safe; a city must be decimated before its drainage is completed; a graveyard, the most sacred piece of earth in a parish, must become an abomination before a substitute is provided; the Thames must become horrid as the Sty- before we cease to drink of it; and our lower classes must huddle in cellars like beasts in a cavern before we think of lodging them properly. " Lot them lodge " themselves," it'may be said, in this latter instance; " we have all to look out for our own lodgings" each one for himself." But it is just possible to carry this system too far, and the truth is that we are continually meddling with the dwellings of the poor in the more crowded parts of our great cities. Old houses are puDled down to make way for a bran new warehouse in the Palladian style of architecture; lofty, dilapidated buildings, in which scores of poor families congregated like rooks in a steeple, are laid low to make way for a church; a new street is driven right through some narrow and dingy but venerable court, and, as the zeal for improvement gathers strength, we hear of wider thoroughfares and larger establishlments. All this time, who thinks of the poor people who are thus displaced? They cannot go to the suburbs, as their betters can; they cannot drive in of a morning from Bighbury or Dulwich to their places of business in a lone-horse brougham, or even in a respectable gig; they cannot pay the railway fare to Blacklheath; the omnibus to Islington is too much for them, and the distance is too great for their weary feet. The consequence is that they must take what places they can get; they must huddle together still more closely in rooms where they were already too closely packed; and, in the end, we have the disgusting squalor which Dr. LETnEBY described in his last report to the City Commission of Sewers. This report, which appeared in our impression of yesterday, has especial reference to the condition of the houses in Plumtree-court, Holborn; but in reality it has a much wider application, as anyone in the slightest degree acquainted with the denser parts of the city must know. In this court, which is situated on the south side of Holborn, and extends from Shoe-lane to w-ithin a few yards of Farringdonstreet, Dr. LETHEBY found a dolony of the most destitute poor, occupying houses small in themselves and contracted in the spaces around. Each house was crowded with inmates, and some of the rooms contained two or three families. Men, women, and children were heaped together in these dismal dens, without furniture, without clothing, without decency. They lay like bundles of rags about the room, the only apology for furniture being a collection of shavings, wvhich served the purposes of a bed. The atmosphere was loathsome, the odour intolerable. But still worse was the moral atmosphere of these wretched abodes, in which the poor creatures, lost to all sense of shame, abandoned themselves to indecencies to which even savages would not have submitted, and which are among the worst manifestations of extreme civilization. The saddest consideration of all is that children are born and nursed and educated in these dens, receiving from their paxents the heritage of disease and a bequest of sin. They are enured to filth; immorality becomes a babit, and crime a necessity. W"ell might Dr. LETIEBY urge the propriety of looking after this degraded class, and providing for it well-regulated lodginghouses sufficiently cheap and commodious. We conclude that the inhabitants of Plumtreecourt belong to the very lowest class of allvagrants, beggars, thieves; but the truth is that the want of convenient lodging-houses, which is felt so extremely by these outcasts, touches more or less all the poorer classes in the neighbourhood; snd we cannot repeat too frequently, that the discomfort of the homes of the labouring population produces not only annoyance and sickness, but leads ditectly through the ginshop to all the degradation that attends beggary, thievery, and vagrancy. The experiment of erecting model dwellinghouses and lodging-houses has been so successful that we venture to urge the Corporation to set about building them on the site of tle Fleet Prison, which has long been vacant, or in the never-to-be-completed thoroughfare from Farringdon-street towards Clerkenwell. We should urge this as a matter of justice to the working classes, and of mercy to the unsettled classes; but these are not the only, nor likely to be the most cogent, arguments for the adoption of this counrse. We do not regard these model houses as a charity; they have proved to be a paying speculation; in some instances they are in the hands of private parties, who find the investment so remunerative that they refuse to seU their interest in the building. Whoever pleases may convince himself of this by going to the model dwelling-houses built by Mr. NEwsox at the back of Berkeley-square, where,with a groundrent of some r0l. or 801., and -with accommodation for two or three dozen families in each house, the rooms are let in pairs, at prices ranging from 3s. to 5s. weelkly, and are found to pay at the rate of about 7 per cent. upon the outlay. It is pleasant to contrast these houses with the squalor of which Dr. LETEBY complains; and in the clean-swept and sometimes carpeted rooms, the clean and curtained windows, the flowers on the wincdowsill, the birdcages hanging outside the doors, with blackbirds and thrushes singing merrily against each other, one feels that here, at least, the tenants take a pleasure in their houses, and know what it is to have a veritable home. Tlhat such dewellings as these might be erected in the city and made remunerative we have not the slightest doubt; and that it is also our absolute duty to build them when modern improvements are every day driving the poor fiuther from their work there can be as little doubt. We think, too, that, without trenching on the economy which it is necessary to observe in all such erections, they might be made an important architectural feature. There is too much monotony in our domestic buildings, and in the galleries which front the diLfferent stories of the model dwelling-houses, the arclhitects have a chance of introducing a novel and very imposing effect. We should thus in befriending the poor obtain a double object,-our charity to them would be in every way a profit to ourselves ; the cheapest houses in London would be among the richest in appearance; and in aiming simply at the useful we shouald most effectually produce the ornamental.
THE CELEBRATION OE THE PEACE. The imposing ceremony which the inhabitants of the metropolis have for weeks past anticipated with so high a degree of interest-to which the authority and countenance of the Sovereign, the spontaneous co-operation of the people, and ihe thrilling events of whichit is the happy consummation all gave significance, while the resources of the pyrotechnic art and the splendours of illumination" were exhausted to lend it brilliancy and Sclat-has been celebrated ; and the ceremony of yesterday will long live in the memory of all who witnessed it as an occasion on which all classes of the inhabitants of this great metropolis, and thousands of others who came from far and near to participate in the general rejoicing, laid aside the varied occupations of their daily lives by common consent, and abandoned themselves to the celebration of a joyous epoch in the nation's history and an interesting national anniversary. The day, dull and sunless throughout, presented all the characteristics of a general holyday, and the town bore all the evidences of a great festival. The shops were for the most part closed, and all business suspended. From the windows of the houses and public buildings in all the main thoroughfares, from Hyde Park to the Mansionhouse, banners floated in the breeze, while others were gracefully festooned with evergreens and flowers. In Piccadilly, St. James'sstreet, and Pall-mall especially, the scene was extremely animated throughout the day. A detachment of Life Guards was stationed at the upper end of St. James's-street, to niaintain a clear entrance from Piccadilly for the carriages proceeding^ the Drawing-room at St. James's Palace ; and along both sides of the street, throughout its entire length, a crowd of well-dressed people had collected to catch a glimpse ofthe brilliant company as they passed slowly along to their destination. Others gazed at the processionof carriages from the windows of the various club-houses and from the balconies of private dwellings decked with bright crimson cloth, while a number of magnificent flags waved high overhead. A much denser crowd was assembled for a similar purpose at the top of the Mall, between Buckingham Palace and St. James's. The booming of cannon proceeding from the Horse Guards and the Tower was heard occasionally, and at intervals the air resounded with the merry peals of bells from many of the churches. Vast crowds, composed chiefly of artisans and their families, neatly dressed, and of large accessions of people from the country, continually augmenting as the day advanced, thronged the principal streets throughout the whole of the morning and afternoon, and as night drew on, and with it the commencement of the iUuminations, ihe moving mass out of doors went on still increasing. At intervals throughout the day special trains on the several railways brought up from the provinces large numbers of visitors, who poured into the central parts of the town, invaded the various hotels, and greatly swelled the numerical strength of the resident population when they turned out at night to witness the pyrotechnic display. Flags innumerable waved from the forest of masts below bridge; each little river steamer carried its tiny Union Jack at the fore; and from every salient point all along the Thames, on each side from Westminster to Woolwich, banners floated in the wind. The weather, somewhat inauspicious in the early part of the day, greatly improved towards night, and the e.Tihibition began and ended under a state of the atmosphere the most favourable for its complete success. The proceedings of the day wereinauguratedby an inspection of theFoot Guards, inSt. James'sPark,by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, accompanied by Prince Frederick William of Prussia, the Prince Regent of Baden, and his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, in the presence of several military officers of distinction, including, among others, Lord Hardinge, the Commander-in-Chief; Sir George Wetherall, Adjutant-General; Lord Cardigan, General Sir Richard Airey, Colonel Gordon, General Smyth, General Sir Charles Yorke, and Colonel Wetherall, forming altogether, as they rode round the lines inspecting the troops, and afterwards took up a position at the saluting point, a brilliant group. It was, in point of fact, the ordinary ceremony which takes place on the anniversary of Her Majesty's birthday, but on this occasion a number of attendant circumstances combined to give it more than usual interest and animation. The troops brought under review were about 500 in number, made up of equal portions ofthe Grenadiers, the Scots FusUeers, and the Coldstream. Guards; there was also a troop of the Horse Guards Blue ; each regiment was accompanied by its band; andthe whole were under the command of Colonel Moncrieff. The infantry, including several men who had fought in the Crimea, were drawn up in line on the esplanade behind the Horse Guards, and withthe cavalryformedtwosides of a square. The Royal party arrived shortly after 10 o'clock, and as they appeared upon the ground they received the customary salute from the troops, and the bands of the several regiments played the national anthem. At this moment the spectacle was extremely animated and imposing. His Royal Highness the Prince Consort wore the uniform of the Grenadier Guards, and rode a beautiful chestnut charger. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge wore the uniform of the Scots Fusileers, and wore his Crimean medal. The splendid uniforms of their Royal Highnesses Prince Frederick WUliam of Prussia and the Regent of Baden marked them out as conspicuous objects in the group, and added to it an additional element of the picturesque. The Prince of Wales and Prince Arthur witnessed the ceremony from an open window immediately over the entrance to the Horse Guards from the Mall. A distinguished party occupied a commanding position on the balcony in front of the house of Lady Dover. The roofs and windows of the Admiralty, the Horse Guards, and all the rest of the adjacent public buildings were crowded with spectators; andthe general public, in great numbers, occupied the vacant ground all round the esplanade. The high health and fine bearing of the men, and the extraordinary precision with which their various evolutions were performed, elicited admiration on all hands. While the effulgent festivities of the night are still dazzlingly present to the memory of the public, it may not be inappropriate to offer a few remarks on the general subject of illuminations, andto enumerate some of the more important occasions on which the joy of the English nation has manifested itself in these brilliant and picturesque displays. To whatever other objections the practice of typifying gladness by light may be liable, it assuredly cannot be alleged against it that it is an innovation. The origin of illuminations as a mode of testifyiug popular delightdates fromthe most remote age3. The custom has long been a favourite topic of indignant declamation with those matter-of-fact people who, measuring aU things with the four-foot rule of practical utility, regard whatever is simply beautiful as an impertinence. One of those philosophers-a man who would probably have made a tarpaulin out of Raphael's cartoons and boiled potatoes in the Portland vase-wrote savagely against it in the 18th century, and denounced it on the very ground of its, immemorial antiquity. "To light up fire3 8»d dance around the bluaag pil<j.. has i>eent" he observed, "»nd is to this day, a mode of rejoicing with man in an uncultivated state." But then the very argument by which he seeks to throw ridicule on the practice only tends to show hownatural and even poetical it is, for he goes on trfremark,_ that » Darkness naturally causes gloomy reflections, while Ught on the contrary brings cheerfulness and hilarity." The grandest fireoff in 1749 from a building erected £ &e Green Park to commemorate the peace . of Aux-la-ChapeUe. The treaty ^as signed ' on the_ 7th of October, 1748, but the ilium? nations did not take place until the 27th - of April on the following year. They -were 'deferred for six mouths, and when at last they'did come off there was all that scene of hurry, bustle and confusion that usuaUy attend the preparations for anEnglish holyday. Not only did the carpentera, gilders, and^ artificers, labour by torchlight to make up for lost time, but it is recorded in the newspapers ofthe day, for the horrification ofExeter-haU that " on Sunday the 9th of March,1749, and on the two foUowingSundaystheworkmenworkedonthebuilding for the fire works inthe Green Park, in orderto have it ready against the day appointed for playing them off, and incredible numbers of persons resorted to see it.-' The structure in question was designed by theChevaUer Servandoni, and "all the framinowas performed by Mr. James Morris, master car" penter to the office of Ordnance." Drawings of the machine or " building," as it was singularly termed, are preserved in the British Museum. The inscriptions on the panels were in that strain of idolatrous adulation in which it was at that time usual to speak of Royalty; and poor George H. was blazoned forth as rex opti~ mus, aiictor salutis, fuiidator quietis, and, pater patrke. In the centre of the temple, seated on an altar, w^s the goddess of Peace holding an oUve-branch, and supported on the right by Neptune, on the left by Mars. A great picture over the cornice in the centre of the machine represented the Eing in the act of patting England on the back, and making her a present of " Prosperity," as you might give a child an orange. In the front were four statues, representing Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence; while on the friezes and entablatures there were nude figures representing aU manner of heathen gods and Christian virtues; Mercury and Minerva were paired off with Faithfulness and Vigilance ; Ceres leant upon the arm of an ablebedied woman designed to represent Religion; and Jupiter walked smilingly along, as weU he might, with Constancy on one arm and Clemency on the other. Then there was no end of medaUions, basso-relievos, wreaths, gariand3, banners, festoons of arms and miUtaiy instruments, and what not besides. But the crowning glory of the whole affair was a transparent picture, representing Britannia nodding famiUarly at France and shaking hands with Spain. " After a grand overture of warlike instruments composed by Mr. Handel," who led the band, and who, for anything that we know to the contrary, may have worn the very same sword, cocked hat, and full-bottomed wig that Rogers saw him decked with not a great many years afterwards, a signal was given for the commencement of the fireworks, which opened with a salute of 101 brass ordnance. Then a thousand artificial meteors sprang into dazzling existence ; rockets, "honorary caduceus and girandole," shot through the air, and, like the arrows of Acesta, caught fire as they flew ; air-baUoons and tourbillons floated about in every direction, and -the spacious firmament on high beheld the prodigious spectacle of half-a-dozen fixed and as many vertical suns in the dead waste and middle of the night. Since that time there have been several iUuminations in London, but there were none deserving of historic mention until the 1st of August, 1814, when the great metropolis was treated to a superb display of fireworks in celebration of the general peace, and to commemorate the centenaiy accession of the family of Brunswick to the British throne. The exhibition was one of matchless magnificence, and Sir William Congreve, under whose superintendence it was conducted, is acknowledged to have borne off the palm of pyrotechnic skill from the French and ItaUan artists. On that occasion the three parks were properly chosen for the scene of the civic jubilee 83 alone affording space for the expansion of the immense multitude. In that of St. James's the principal object of curiosity was a Chinese bridge, thrown over the ornamental watera, in the centre of which was erected a lofty pagoda, while the other parts were decorated with piEars and boxes for the exhibition of fireworks. The Birdcage-walk and part of theMail were hung with Chinese lanterns. In t"he Green Park, on the edge of the MaU, was placed the Royal booth, of a circular form, with a gaUery attached to it for the Ministers of State and Foreign Ministers. In Hyde Park there was a mimic naval engagement on the Serpentine, the French and British fleets "being most ignobly represented by barges brought from Woolwich. But all the glories of former iUuminations were thrown completely into the shade by the matchless magnificence of the exhibition of last night, when for hours together London was one dazzling mass of artificial light. Like the enchanted palace in " Vathek," it was " the dehght of the eyes and the support of memory." HYDE PARK. The programme of pyrotechnic amusement was precisely the same in aU the parks, but the convenient situation of Hyde Park, its great extent, the beauty of its grounds, and it3 delightful combination of wood and water invested it with pecuUar charms, and made it a favourite centre of attxacl tion. It was of course universaUy known that, from the very nature of the entertainments, they could not commence nntU a late hour of the evening, but the anxiety to secure aplace that would command a good view of the fireworks snppUed thousands with a motive for early attendance, and hence it happened that for many hours before nightfaU the scene was as fuU of gaiety and motion as a fancy-fair. The coup d'oiil was briUiant and animated beyond description, and the grounds must assuredly have presented a very different appearance from that which they afforded in the middle of the sixteenth century, when the French Ambassador hunted there with the Eing, and the Duke Casimir "lolled a doe with his piece from among 300 other deer." Deer there were none last night, but human beings were almost ' as plentiful as leaves in the forest and sands npon the seashore. Thousands of aU ages, sexes; and conditions came flocking into the park as soon as the gates were opened. They looked anxiously for what our American cousins would caU "comfortable locations," and viewed with that keen anticipation of coming pleasure. which is half the zest of human enjoyment, the operations of fixing and preparing the various piecea intendedto figure in the grand performance of the evening. In addition to the fixed frames with which the pubUc eye had been for some daysfamiliar, there were now stands of lockets ready for firin<*> in flights of twenties and fifties, covered with tart paulins, while a numerous train of waggons from 'Woolwich similarly protected was also, on the ground, fiUed to overflow with pyror tech-aie projectiles. As early as 5 o'clock th& spacft in the immediate vicinity of the Marble Arci was more densely crowded than -»e remember to. ha^e ever seen Ludgate-hiU, and it is due to ishe people to, say that their conduct T» t_xs& %-ke.-»p>Vsry»
FOBEIaN INTELLIGENCE. TRANCE. lEpartionof the following appeared in our second edition Of Yesterdav.:-1 (PROM OUR. OWMN CoafMFO1NDZF.) PARIS, WEDNESDAY, MLAY 28, 6 P.M. The foUowing letter has been addressed to the Diritto (Turin news naper)P s " Paris, May 20. " I believe it urgent to answer another objection. I have been told that by advising the national party in Italy to confide in the Piedmontese Government I render the patriots of Italy apathetic and preach inertness. Now, nothing could be further from my intention. I said that the national party in Italy ought to give its co-operation to the Piedmontese Government, in the event of that Government entering on the way which conducts to the common end-viz., the independence and unity of Italy. The national party does not abdicate; it co-operates. Co-opehation isaction, and not inertness. Already in March, 1854, 'when I protested against the counsels of Lord John Russell, I affirmed that we should ever agitate until such time as our inextinguishable aspirations for national independence were satisfied. And now, in the name of the great National party, I say to the Italian patriots, 'Agitate, agitate, ardently, incessantly, until our object be gained-until Italy shall become one and independent., I have every confidence that the Piedmontese Govern ment will be with us, and that conffdence is increased by recent events. If I be deceived, it will be a great misfortune; but, even then, the National Italian party should not desist from its labours. In any case, and in any event, and until Italy become independent and one, Italians, all you wvho love your native Land, listen to the word which comes to you from the exile, ' Agitate, agitate P' The following private telegraphic despatches have been received 3ALRSEILLES, MAY 28. "The Preasse dOricjmt, of the 10th, announces that four Christians and one Jew had been appointed members of the Council of the Empire. " The individuals lately tried at Varna for murder had arrived at Constantinople. " The Internuncio of Austria had left Constantinople to examine the mouths of the Sulina. " A serious collision had taken place at Philippopolis between the Christians and Mussulmans. " According to the last accounts from the Crimea Marshal Pelissier will shortly leave for France, and General 3S?Mahon will assume the command of the army. "Letters from Odessa, of the 14th, state that the quarantine has been fixed at four days. The price of wheat was firm, and that of coal had increased. " MAY 27 (Ev-NsNG). "The Danube has arrived with accounts from Constantinople to the 19th. "A fresh attempt at revolt of the Mussulmans had taken place at Jerasalem, but had been put down. Several quarrels with the Christians had occurred in Roumelia." " VIENNA, MAY 27. "The semi-official jounmal, the Austrian Correspondence, publishes an article on the evacuation of the Danubian provinces, which it says has been commenced, and asserts that t will be completed so soon as the stipulations of the treaty of Paris concerning the organization of the Principalities 5hall have been fulfilled." The Indgpendance Bedge publishes the following letter, dated Warsaw, 24th inst.:- " The Emperor, on his return from the cathedral, gave audience, at the Palace of the Bel-widere, to the dignitarieS of the Catholic, Greek, and Protestant churches, the memberS of the Government, the marshals of the Polish nobility, the notable inhabitants of the country, the superior officers of the army, and the public functionaries of the second and third classes. His Majesty showed himself extremnely affable towards everybody. The most remarkable and important of all the speeceiis delivered on the occasion is that addressed by the Sovereign to the marshals and nobility, who were received together. I do not know if the speech is to be published in the official GazeUe, which is to appear this evening. That of yesterday makes no mention of it, and down to the present momenttwo hours before the departure of the mail-the text of the Imperial address has not yet been sent to the editor of that 3ournaL The following is the substance of it :-' My line of conduct towards your country,' said the Emperor, ' will consist in an absolute oblivion of the nast. I am satisfied with the Poles, not only because, in spite of the revolutions and wars which lately disturbed Europe, they did not forget the duties they had to fulfil towards their Sovereign and themselves, but also because those who fought in the ranks of my soldiers gave proofs of bravery and unshaken loyalty. I bear them all, therefore, in ny heart, and I shall never cease to love the Poles as mv own children. I request you to tell this to your country. men; but tell them also that the period of wild schemes has gone by. Let there be no more of them, gentlemen. I wish Poland to be happy, and she can only be so by her union with Russia.' It is useless to say that this speech, delivered with an expression of conviction and benevolence, produced a deep impression on all present. The higher classes of our society, on being informed of the sentiments of the Monarch, received them with marked satisfaction. They applanded the frankness and confidence with which the Emperor addressed the nation. As for the people, their demonstrations are full of expansion and enthusasm. They prove that they appreciate the blessings already conferred on the country by the Emperor. Last evening, when the Emperor was riding through the park of Lazienki, the population assembled in his passage saluted him with acclamations until he re-entered the palace. In the afternoon of yesterday HisLsMjesty proceeded, with Prince Gortschakoff, to the railway station to receive his sister, the Grand Duchess Olga. and her husband, the Prince Royal of Wurtemberg. Afew hours after her arrival tiie Grand Duchess drove through the parks and streets of Warsaw, which were again illuminated. A grand ball is to be given to-night by Prince Gortschakoff, whose wife was honoured yesterday with a visit from His Majesty. The ball of the nobility is to take place after to-morrow-. That of the city will be given at the Hotel de Vile, but the night has not yet been fixed." The Monile,'r cle la Flotte has the following from the banks of the Finnish Gulf, under date the 20th inst.:- " The first steamer of the regular line passed before Cronstadt on the morning of the 20th, coming from St. Petersburg, and going to Stettin, in Prussia. This vessel had put to sea three days before, but had been obliged to ctturn to port on account of the immense quantity of floating ice in the Gulf. The country for some days has offered a most extraordinary meteorological phenomenon. The heat, considering the season, is intense, the average lua'ge of the centigrade thermometer in the shade being between 21 and 22 deg., while the Neva and the Gulf of Finland are covered with enormous pieces of ice, which obstruct the navigation. This ice comes from Lake Ladoga, where the temperature continues very low, and the thaw is greatly behind its time. The accounts from that quarter, as also fromn the lmen, Iake Onega, and the Volkhova, state that the navigation of those waters will not be completely free until the 1st of next month. You must not, however, judge of other years by rhe present one, for last winter, with those of 1803, 1812, wnd 1829, was one of the most severe of this century. On board the Stettin steamer are a number of families, who have obtained passports for France, and are going to Paris, rid Germany. Paris will be for some time the favourite resort of the Russian nobility. The accounts from Astrachan, received at Cronstadt, come down to the 5th instant. A portion of the crews of the Black Sea ships had been placed on board the Caspian Sea fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Wasilieff. These seamen cannot divest themselves of the painful impression produced by the capture of Sebastopol, towards which their thoughts are constantly turned. They inhabit a suburb of Astrachan, which has received the name of Karabelnaia, in remembrance of the ceiebrated suburb of Sebastopol wlhere they were quartered. They have crected in the centre of the suburb a triangular pyramid, surmounted with a cross, in honour of the three admirals killed during the siege, for whose memory they entertain a religions veneration. On one of the sides of the monument is inscribed the name of Kornileff, on the other that of Nachimoff, and on the third that of Istomine." Tle trial of the news agent, Lejolivet, on a charge of complicity in purloining public documents, and of bribing and corruptig a servant of the State, co3r.es on before ty*oAilrt of &Assizes of Paris in the early part of next month. He is charged with having induced one of the workmen of the Imperial printing-office to purloin the copies of the treaty! of peace and the protocols, in order to communicate them to the newspapers, the Lid6pedcda7cw Beige and the 2Yord. Lejolivet is now in prison at the Conciergerie waiting his trial; and two persons employed in his news-office will be arrested to-. morrow, also to take their trial on the charge of aiding and abetting in the act. The unfortunate cmployg at the printing-office has not only lost his place, but will aZo be tried for the same offence, to which he says he was induced by the promrises of Lejolivet to bearhim harmless. Should Ljolivet himself get off on the present charge, it is said that the persons whose ,prospects have been miled xill proceed.asndt him. or damages to cover the los5 to themselves and their smilies.

The subjoined article, which appeared in the Ministerial Oeserreichische Co-rreponadevz of last night, must be considered a supplement to that of which a translation was forwarded yesterday. That it is from the same source-the Foreign-ofice-need hardly be said:- " A number of North German papers and correspondents continually repeat that the Imperial Court desires to induce Prussia to guarantee the territory of the Austrian empire, more particularly that part of it which is in Italy, and they do not fail to make the most of this theme of their own invention. "Neither the papers in question nor their readers need be under any alarm. Austria, which in the most trying and dangerous times of external and internal confusion found means to retain possession of the Italian Crown lands, has the consciousness of being perfectly well able to defend both her territory and the position which is hers by right of treaty against any attack. The power of Austria is based on her internal strength and on European treaties which are recognized and respected by all the Powers. As to the policy of the Austrian empire, it is based on a respect for all acquired rights. " True to its 'principle'-regard for the independence of all sovereignties,-the Imperial Royal Government can never recognize the right which is cLaimed by the Sardinian Court to speak in the name of Italy. Although regarding things from a point of view entirely different, we cannot but agree with the opinion expressed by that Minister, that in the perception of international relations, rights, and duties, there is an impassable galf between Austria and the present Sardinian Cabinet. " Wherever Austria has intervened in Italy she has done so in the most disinterested manner ; she has intervened at the request of the different Sovereigns, and, as soon as I one or other of them has declared his ability to maintain pubaic peace and order without foreign assistance, the Imperial forces have been withdrawn from his territories. Pradent and judicious reforms, freely emanating from the respective Sovereigns, may conduce to the wished-for peace and quiet of theItalianStates, and the Imperial Government has never failed to give its advice in that direction, though always with that corsideration which is due to the dignity and independence of foreign States. "Austria is ready to give her approval to all advantageous changes which may emanate from the free and enlightened will of the Italian Governments, and she wishes nothing more earnestly than that the time may soon come when the Italian Sovereigns, to whom she has afforded'her disin terested support against the revolution and its agents, may be able to dispense with the assistance of the Austrian troops, but she wiU firnly repel any unjustifiable attack which snay be made on those Italian States that are alied to her, and n-ill do all in her power to counteract the machinations of the anarchists, and to prevent revolutionary agitation." One passage in the foregoing article is not likely to obtain full credence in foreign countries; it is that in which Austria boasts of her " disinterestedness." If by the word " disinterestedness"' the official writer means to say that Austlia does not covet the possessions of her Italian friends, he probably speaks the simple truth, but if he intends to convey the impression that Austria derives no advantage from her frequent and prolonged occupations of her neighbours' territories, he is either deceived hinself or he wishes " to throw dust" into the eyes of others. The obiect of Austria is, if possible, to make her political influence supreme in the Italian peninsula; and no one who is acquainted with the course of events during the last quarter of a century can well doubt that she is in a fair way to attain her aim. On the 20th instant the E-nperor addressed an autograph letter to General Count Coronini, in which he thanks him for the wayin which he has managed matters in the Danubian Principalities. and confers on him the Grand Cross of the order of Leopold. By an army order of the same date His Majesty announces that his troops are beginning to ,quit Moldavia and Wallachia, and at the same time expresses the satisfaction which the conduct of officers and men has given him. The recent articles of the Nor-d relative to the reform of the German Bund have greatly annoyed the Austrian,Government. It is not a little significant that )Princeb Francis Lichtenstein (and not an Archduke) goes to~'Warsaw to meet the Emperor Alexander. As you have already been informed, Prince Paul Esterhazy will represent Austria at the coronation of the Czar. As the late Baron Sina, the banker, bequeathed nothing to the poor, his only son and heir intends to build and endow an hospital. The property left by the deceased is valued at 110,000,000fl.; his debts amount to 25,000,000fl. or 26,000,000fl. The net annual revenue arising from his estates is 2,43,000fl., and his houises in this city bring in nearly 500,000fl. more. The expenses of the defunct for housekeeping may have been about 20,0001. a year. PRUSSIA. (FRO3r OUIR oWN CORRESPONDENT.) BERLIN, TALkY 27. The Queen left Potsdam this morning early for a a place called Riesa, on the Saxon frontier, whence she is to fetch her sister, the present Queen of Saxony, and bring her back with her to Potsdam, to 30oa in the already numerous circle of high-born ladies assembled there to welcome the Empress of Russia. The latter has apparently so far recovered from her fatigues as to have been able to dIrive out yesterday with the Queen and revisit all the grounds and gardens about Potsdam and Sans Souci. The Empress herself inhabits the' palace in the town, -where there is a chapel fitted up for the ritual of the Russo-Greek church. Baron M.Ieyendorff, the former Minister of Russia here, and subsequently at Vienna, who was to have accompanied the Empress on her journey hither, but was prevented bv illness from so doing, is expected to arrive to-day at Stettin on board the same vessel that brings Count Nesselrode and 1rince Woronzoff. The Prussian MAinister at St. Petersburg, Baron Werther, will also be of the party. After leaving Aix-la-Chapelle, on the 23d inst., where the Princess Louisa has commenced taking the waters, the Princess of Prussia returned by way of Cologne to Coblentz; the following morning she set off for Baden-Baden, attended by the Prince's Adjutant, CountFuirstenberg Stammheim. AtMannheim she was to meet with the Prince Regent of Baden, who is, in compliance with an invitation from the Queen, on his way to England, which, according to the present arrangements, he would reach to-morrow. On the occasion of the approaching marriage of the Prince Regent with the Princess Louisa, there will be a fund raised here for presenting five young couples about to marry with a present of 100 thalers each towards their outfit on the anniversary of the wedding. The nomination of these couple is. to rest with the future Pris J Regent of Baden, and they are to be chosen, two from the Evangelical, two from the Catholic, and one from the Mosaic persuasion in Prussia. It is reported here that General Count Benkendorff, military representative of Russia at this Court, wlln be nominated to the post of Minister at Stattgard, in the room of Ierr von Titofft He will probably accompany the Empress on herjourney from here thither to visit the springs at Wildbad. It is also looked on as tolerably certain that 31. de Fonton, formerly Secretary of Legation here and at Vienna,will shortly go as Mlinister to represent Russia at Frankfort. In addition to the various topics of interest which I mentioned yesterday as having occupied the Prussian press duning the past week or ten days must be mentioned the triple treaty concluded betw een England, France, and Austria; it is, however, unnecessary to recapitulate the conjectures and the lucubrations to wvhich this unexpected transaction gave rise; its truie nature and intentions have alreadybeenmade known officiallyand authentically. One great security that it offers for the future maintenance of peace is the amount of certainty it conveys as to the position Austria would take up in the case of another infraction of the peace by Russia or any other Power in connexion with the Eastern question; she would not be on the side of Russia, and this will suffice, in conjunction with the knowledge of England and France hanging together, to prevent any future Emperor of Russia from troubling Europe again on the subjec of European Turkey. This treaty of April 15 was not known to this Governmnent, any more than to that of Russia, until it was published in England; its pubEication, however it surprised, did not, as far as I have heard, produce any unpleasant feeling here, either from its tendency, or from the fact of Prussia not having been admitted into the triple confidence and invited to join. Since its publication both England and France have communicated its contents to this Government through their representatives here (Austria, on the other hand, has not made any communication at all on the subject), and our representativeherehas furthermore orally expressedto the Minister of Foreign Affairs the satisfaction England would feel at seeing Prussia join in it. The state of feeling here towards England is so extremely improved in Government circles, not only on account of the approximation of the two Courts, but also from the friendly tone lately assumed by our Foreign-office and its representative here, that it wll certainly be with great regret that this Cabinet will, as I imagine, find itself prevented, in consistency with the policy it has hitherto followed, and for a very long time to come must follow, from acceding to the proposition. I have not been able to learn that this Government has given any answer as yet, and probably it will prefer to let the matter slumber as it is unless pressed by an official note; but the considerations which I lately put forward to you as having governed the policy of Prussia towards her overpowerful and overpowering neighbour Russia, not only in the last war, but also dulring the preceding, 40 years of peace, in which she was invariably ill-treated by Russia, will, I have little doubt, continue to be obligatory on - her. There is at present no urg,enlt necessity for Prussia to take any more decided part in the European adjustment than she has hitherto done, and, until a decisive crisis comes, it is her policy to keep herself free from al engagements, and most of all from one that involves a casits belli with Russia, no matter how distant. I believe these to be the views of this Government. The considerations which I have alluded to above, and have mentioned on a former occasion, as withholding Prussia from any participation in a European war that she can avoid, are the following :-Geog,raphical position, nature and extent of frontier, deficient financial rasources, and her peculiar military organization. As long as these remain as they are at present it wil always tax Prussia's powers to the utmost to defend herself if attacked by a great Power; for her to attack one is out of the question. On former occasions I have endeavoiured to show that the attitude of Prussia towvards Russia during the past war was by no means influenced by any love or affection between the two monarchs (which did not exist at all), nor even by the ties of affection between the King of Prussia and his sister on the throne of Russia; that attitude will, I believe, continue the same in the ensuing peace, and be governed solely by reasons of State policy, but the feelings between the two reigning families have certainly undergone a great change of late for the better, and will, m all probability, be much further improved within a very short space of time. The present Emperor Alexander has, by his personal qualities, acquired a strong hold on the affections of his uncle the Prince of Prussia, who has had several opportunities of studying his character. During his stay at this Court there is no doubt that lie wil make the same agreeable impression on the King, who at present knows very little of him. The soairce of aversion, repugnance, and fear is no longer in existence to prevent the members of the two families from meeting in cordial harmony; and,though the Dowager Empress is believed to be thoroughly imbued with the views and convictions of her deceased consort, the difference of position that she now takes up in the Russian empire will prevent the divergence from the feelings and tastes of her brothers from having any disturbing influence on their intercourse. Of al her brothers thePrince of Prussia is thegreatest favourite with the Empress. It was he who was despatched from here to condole with her on the occasion of her bereavement, and it will be he who will, on the occasion of herson's approaching coronation, conduct her from Germany back to MIoscow. In spite of this improved state of feeling between the two families of Russia and Prussia, the course of the latter a 3 a country is distinctly laid down for the futureindependence of Russia, alliance with England, constitutional government, liberal commercial principles, and development of her material interests. Baron Stieglitz has arrived here from Paris on his way backto St. Petersbiurg; his negotiations with the Parisian Credit Mobilier appear to have been perfectly without result; on his way back hither he has entered into relations with the bankers of Cologne, MIessrs. Oppenheim and Mevissen, with a view to their taking part in the financial arrangements which the Russian Government desires to see completed, but which the unassisted means of the house Stieglitz is incompetent to compass. With a view to the conclusion of the arrangements, the two heads of the abovementioned house will repair to St. Petersburg to confer personally with the Ministers there; Herr Oppenheim has already arrived here on his way thither, and Herr Mevissen istofollow immediately. On 'Change yesterday there was a talk of a new Austrian loan, and in consequence all Austrian paper was subjected to a fall.
A NovEn CHAsE.-Last year a seaman belonging to this port entered the navy at Greenock, and was transferred in course to England, and there put on board one of Her Majesty's ships, from which, however, he soon after deserted. Nothing was heard of his whereabouts till within the last few days, when information was forwarded to the naval authorities here that the deserterwas understood to be employed on board a certain gabart. On inquiry it was found that this gabart had sailed on the previous aiay with a caTgo of manure for GarelochBside. An armed patty of men from the shin Athole, accompanied by a person who could identify the deserter, crossed to the Gareloch by first steamer in search of their man. IThey discovered the gabart aground near to the shore up the loch, and carts were engaged aleI side discharging the manure, the horses being breast high in the loch. Having procured an empty cart and horse, the pursuing party put off froni the shore towards the gabart. mthe meantime the man they were in pursuit of espied them from the vessel, and, at once guessing their errand, he sprang into the gahart's beat without taking time even to put on a jacket, and sculled away rapidly for the opposite shore. Htis pursuers instantly put back to land in the cart, and, getting into a heat which lay a short distance further upthe loch, pulled rapidly after the fugitive, and when within hail demanded him to surrender, or they would fire on him. "Fire away, " bawled the fugitive, as he plied his scull ear with redoubled vigour. The chase became exciting, but the deserter had got the start of his pursuers, and managed to keep out of pistol-shot, and, havsng gained the opposite bank, without waiting to haul up his boat, he sprang to land, and in a few minutes he was lost to view among the brashwood and heather, to the great mortification of the pursuing party. Where he will next turn up it is difficult to say.-Glasgow Chroniclek THE ScoTrH L&Av OF ML, RIAGE.-On Friday a marriage was performed here before a justice of the peace. A complaint was brought at the instance of the justice of the peace fiscal, that a seaman and a girl residing in Ropework-street had been livmig as man and wife without being lawfully married, and had thus committed a clandestine marriage, an offence proper to be brought before the Court, and praying for a fine to be imposed. The parties having appeared and admitted the facts, the sitting justice flned them in 2s. 6d. and costs, 21. 10s. The fine is to be paid to the poor of the mid-parish of Greenock, within which the Sheriff Clerk's office, where the case was tried, is supposed to be. The proceedings described have the effe^t of constituting a legal marriage, and were adopted becauEe the seaman was to proceed to sea on that day.- GreenockA4dverti-ser,

I In this case a rule had been granted for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection. The action was against the law Property Assuance and Trust Society, upon a policy by which the society had guaranteed the plaintiff against the criminal acts, such as embezzlement and larceny, of one J. Dr. Wood, the plaintiff's town traveller; and the question now raised was, whether the plaintiff had given notice in due time to the society that a liability had been incurred. It was contended, on the part of the defendants, that, under the circumstances, the learned Lord Chief Justice ought to have directed a verdict for the defendants. Mr. ELXNNEM, in the absense of his learned leader, who is now one of the Barons of the Exchequer, showed caune against the rule. Mr. Edwvin James, Q.C., and Mr. Hawkins supported it. The COURT decided that there had been no misdirection, and that the rule ought to be discharged. When this case was disposed of the Court rose, at about 12 o'clock. BAIL COURT, !tLA 29. (Sittirgs in Baino, beforc Mr. JasticeI VIGHTGArN.) THE QUEE-Y V. THE JUSTICES OF STrAYFORDSaUsE. Mr. HUDDLESTON moved for a rule to show cause why the justices should not hear and adjudicate upon a summons against a person named Badkin. It appearea that a sun of money had been borrowed from the Public Loan Coinmissioners under the 5th of George IV., c. 36, for the repar of the church at Abbot's Bromley. The act provided tbat a rate should be levied for the payment of the money within 20 years, with interest at 4 per cent. A rate had bEen made in 1853 and 1854, and had been paid. Another rate was made in 1855, and Badldn was rated at Ss. Ld. He refused to pay this last rate; he was summoned before the justices, and disputed his liability and the validity of the rate, contending that, under the 53d of George Il., c. 107, the justices had no jurisdiction, and that the only place for proceedings was in the ecclesiastical court. The justices dechined to proceed, considering that the 53d George III. was incorporated with the 5th George IY. This rulewas therefore moved for. Rule granted.
COURT OF COMON pT.R AS. WETwSSTz MAY 29. (Sittin.gs in Banco, Trinity Ternm.) The Court sat this morning for a short time to hear motions, and adjourned at 12 o'clock. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at Westminster, before Mr. Justi2e CROWDER anid a Common. Jury.) MILFORD V. ISAACS. The trial of this cause, which was commenced on Tuesday, lasted during the whole of Wednesday and terminated this day (Thursday). The action was brought to recover from the defendant remuneration for leave to cerform certain pieces, alleged to have been written by the plaintiff either wholly or in part, and acted by the defendant, Miss Rebecca Isaacs, at theatres managed by her or over which she had control. The plaintiff also sought to recover penalties under the Dramatic Authors Copyrght Act for several performances of the same pieces, which he said had taken place without his consent, and for which Miss Isaacs was responsible. The plays in question were entitled King Queer and his Dlnaughtq-s Three; Thic L:ttle Demon, an adaptation from the French; and three songs in The Pet of t7e Public. The defence was in effect, that no contract had been entered into by Miss Isaacs to pay the plaintiff for these pieces, and that he was not the author ot them Witnesses were called in support of the respective cases of the plaintiff and of the defendant, and belonging, as they did, for the most part to the theatrical profession, their evidence was very amusing to those who heard it, both from th_quature of the questions put andfrom the manner in which the answers were given. It would, however, be impossible to give more than a general outline of any, excepting the tv.dence of the plaintiff and that of the defendant. Mr. HOCGCIS having stated shortly the case for the plaintiff, Mr. H.kCuE called Joseph Ealford.-I am the plaintiff in this cause, a dranatic author and comedian. At the beginning of last year the defendant, Miss Isaacs, was the manager of the Strand Theatre. Iwas engaged at 41. a-week, but that was contingent on the receipts, after all other actors and aU expenses were paid. About the middle of May another arrangement was made. I performed in two or three pieces every night from January to that time, and only received 51. los. ; 51. was a gratuity on Miss Isaacs's benefit. I performed until I laid myself upon a bed of sickness. About five or six weeks before Easter I had a conversation with the defendant. We were saying that Easter drew nigh and there sho7cld be some novelty. I said that Mr. Francis Talfollrd should be asked to do something. Miss Isaacs said, "He wants 401. or 50. for a good extravaganza." Isaid, "That was not dear, if it were a good one." She said, " Have you nothing by you i" I said, " Ihada burlesque on King LCar, which I proposed caLling King Queer." She laughed, and was delighted. I said, *"If it must be finished, occupied as I as at-the theatre, I could not do the verbiage." MIr. Justice CnOwnDER-The what ? Ir. Serjeant BYLvS.-Oh, my Lord, we know what that ii here. AWitness in continuation.-The verbiage is our expression for the dialogue. Eventually Mr. Collins was called in to assist, and he and I went through it, act for act and scene for scene. I gave him all my ideas; for instance, coupling Cordelia and the fooL In fact, I did anl what we call the inventive part. Mr. Collins furnished mnc with the rough copy, and I corrected and interlined it. It was afterwards printed. In May a fresh arrangement was entered into. 1 told Miss lsaaes I could not go on any longer, and I really could not. I then said I would go on if my expenses were paid. King Queer vas acted 70 times, and I did not get a farthing. Mfiss Isaacs agreed to give me 21. a-week for my expenses, and as she said it would not do to take King Queer out of the paper, she agreed to pay me for-the nights it was acted. It was afterwards played five nights, and so was 27Te Little Demon, on the 21st, the 22d the 23d, the 24th, the 25th, and the 26th of May; one of these nights was my benefit, so I do not count that. Thze Little Demon I should call an adaptation; there was in it much mnatter of my own. I wrote three songs in The Pet of the Public-" They call me Pretty Madeline," "The Trumpet Loudly Caling," and " Love's Gentle Language." Miss lsaacs sang "Pretty Madeline," and perhaps that is tlhe reason it is encored three times every night. Tze Pet w as performed five nights in June. I think IO& a-night not too much for hberty to perform each piece. Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant BYLES.-I wrote all the songs in King Qucer, and I acted King Queer, and a queer part it was. Miss lsaaes acted Cordelia and the Fool (The learned Serjeant here tookinto his hand the libretto of this play, and much amusement was caused by his reading passages from several of the songs and croes-examining upon hem). ViUikmns was a party attached to Dinah. Mr. Robson sings the song, and mine is a parody. If you have ever heard the original you wil seethe afrinity; if not, it is vainl to try to explain it to you The play was registered in Collins's name afterwards. I procured my name to be added by judge's order. I never could get to see the treasurer's books. I did not ask for the 51. which was given me. It vas handed to me in an envelope. I hada benefit. I do not know whether I received 91. or 41. 10s., but I was out of pocket. MIy benefit vas none to me. There were many versions of 27Te LittleDemnon.-one by Archer. I did not use it. I played Don RIaphael, the lover. I do not know whom I loved, but she was a very clever and beautiful girl. I only composed the words of the songs in The Pet of the Puolic. Mr. Tnlly furnished the melodies and some ideas. I found the words and the polish. 3Mr. Tully said the whole piece wanted enlivenng. I do not know that he said Miss Isaacs's part wanted enlivening. I do not remember saying-that I would write a couple of songs and make her a present of them if TnUy would set them to music. We were walking at tbe iront of the sta"e when our arrangement was made. I sued Bliss Isaacs in the County Court, but I withdrew my claim as she was a sister actress and a lady. I have heard that Colins has made claims against her. Mr. Egan.-I saw the plaintiff correcting Collins's manuscript. This was at CollIims office, about a fortnight before Easter, 1855. Mr. Selvyn.-I made copies of King Quteer from the plaintiff's manuscript. I was employed by Miss Isaacs. I did all the copying at the Strand Theatre. Mrs. Plummer (late Miss Beaumont).-I acted at the Strand Theatre in 1855. nte Pet was acted. I do not know if the theatre paid. M1rs. Turner.-I am an actress. The Pet was performed at the Sheffield Theatre, in July 19, 1855, for the benefit of Miss laacs, who was " starring" there. She sang "Pretty Madeline.h n Mr. TulUy.-I furnished the music for the songs in T7he Pet of the Public, and wrote what is technically called the "nonsense," that is the outline and rhymes. Mr. Tilbury the actor, Mr. Peel, Mr. Kingsbury, the musical director at Drury-lane Theatre, and others connected with dramatic affairs, were called, and throughout the case both of the plaintiff and of the defendant great amusement was afforded by the theatrical gestures and manner of gfivng evidence of the witnesses. -Mr. Serjeant BYLES, after an able speech for the defence, calle Miss Isaacs.-I am the defendant. Last year Mr. Alleroft and the plaintiff called on me at my residence in Store-street ; an arrangement was made that the plaintiff was to be stage-manager, to write and adapt all pieces that might be required; that after paying all expenses, including rent,- the plaintiff was to have 41. a-week out of the profits, if they amounted to 151,; Mr. Payne, 31. ; and mysel 81. ; and in the same proportion if the profits were less. Mr. Payne was to be acting manager. Two or three times during this arrangement there were profits, out of which the plaintiff received in this oroportion. After some time another arrangement was come to with the plaintift, to commence on the 21st of May; he was to have 21. a-week in lieu of any share of profits. The plaintiff had a benefit, at which I played, buty was taken ill, and could not play on the other days, up to the 20th of May. The plaintiff never said he should expect to be paid if his pieces were played. When the second arrangement was made the plaintiff -aid, "Am I to be paid for my pieces?l" I rereplied, *"KTo; thatis included in the arrangement." I never agreedtopaythe plaintifffor the useof his pieces. With regard to The Little Denwn, the p=intiff wished it to be playea at his benefit. I said the name should be altered from The Lttle Dezii; he {would alter it, and rewrite my part, to evade the author's fee. I was unable to act in it from illlness, and another lady took the part. In addition to 21. a-week certain, the plaintiff was to receive a share of the profits, in the proportion of the first anzangement. I lost e0I. at the Strand Theatre, besides losing my whole time. There were no songs in The Pet of tae Pui ass originally written by Mr. Stirlng (manusciipt here pro. duced). It was written for me to introduce songs. The plaintiff and Mr. Tully were present at the reberesal. Mr. Tully suggested that a song an sabots- would be effectiveand said he had no time to -write the words, but s ideas to the plaintifE I asked him to write words. The plaintiffsaid he had one or two songs-if I would sing them. lt is a comsmon ocCcurrence for song writers and composers to ask performers to sing them in order to manke them popular. Mr. Tully brought me two songs, which1 Isa in The Pet, but I did not know they were the p ti>s When I sang "Pretty Madeline" it Sheffield the words were my own, not the plaintiff's. No claim ws made by the plaintiff before that at the County Court, which was before I went to Sheffield. I was orily manageress of the Strand, and had no other inter~st but that taken under the arrangement, viz., to receive my share. 31r. Davis was appointed treasurer by Mfr. 41lcroft, and we all consented. I never instructed him to withhold the books from the plaintiff. The ol. given to the plaintiff was a gratuity. I he plaintiff night have seen the books. The treasurer gave me accounts of the receipts, but the money was sent to Mr. Alleroft. I never received money fromn the treasurer exceptin- when there were profits. Davis left the theatre in June, 1i55. He had not settled his accounts then. ,or has he since. The day before he left he paid me 221,. I believe whenhelefthe had money of the theatre. Ithink not lOOl. I have not called on him to account. The gross amount which I have received in five or six months is under 20I. besides my benefit. I plavedat Worcester on the 2d of November, 1S55. 3ir. Cohnan selectd King Queer. I selected She Pet of Ute PuWe: at Sheffield for my benefit I did not sing Mr. Tuly~s music, or use Mr. flalford's words. C. J. Collins.-I have composed several dramatic pieces. The ori,inal pencil draught of King Qaeer was in my writing and entirely my composition. The draught produced by the plaintiff is a copy of my pencil draught, with corrections by the plaintiff-some suggested by one, some by the other. In ny opiion the plaintiff's alterations are no improvements. Ihe plaintiff agreed that it should be registered in my name. The plaintiff afterwards applied to have his name joined; I opposed the application; but the judge made the order. T'he printd book put in has in it much more marked by the plaintiff than was written by him. Mr. Davis, the treasurer of the Strand Theatre, was then called, and said that he never refused to let the plaintiff see the books ; that Miss Isaacs had the books, and that he gave her an account of the receipts every day. They averaged 101., 121., and 171. a-night-in Easter week more. At the second arrangement the plaintiff wanted 3l. a-week. Miss Isaacs said she could not afford that, but if the receipts vould bearit he should have it. Mr. John Coney.-Iam-an actor, and performed in 7Tw Littlc Der4oln. I learned my part from Archer's copy. The Vilaintiff had written up his own part, and I had to refer to itfor the "cnes." The plaintiff wasverystrict in enforcin fmnes. This is never done in well-regulated theatres to such a degree. Charles George Pigeon.-I was prompter last year at the Strand Theatre. I prompted from the printed copy of the play, but the plaintiff vampedup his part, no alteration was made in any other part. Plaintiff and I went about billsticking for 18 or 20 miles round, and he told me that we were saving author's fees by altering the name of the play. Mr. John Howard.-I played in 27w Little Denon Asmodeus and that are the same. T7hc Little Dcm4n, was not read as a new play. Nr. William loveMI Phillips, a musical composer and professor at the Rtoyal Academy, stated that it was an advantage to the author of a song to have it sung by a popular singer, and that sometimes the singer was paid for doing so. At the close of the case for the defendant 3r. Serjeanut BYLES submitted that the defendant was not liable to any penalty for acting in King Quer, at Worcester or .t Sheffield, as she was en acrtres only; that Collins was co-author and ought to have been joined in the action;- that he in fart assented to the zepresentation at Worcester; that 2heLitleDe2noz was not written by the plaintiff;that the songs in Thle Pet were not a dramatic piece; and that Tully was the author. Mr. HEAwrNs added that songs introduced into a piece were not within the act. lJr. HOGrc-Ls, in reply, urged that Mr. Halford had clearly made himself out to be the author of King Queer, Thte Little Demon, and a portion of 17Tc Pet; and that he was entitled to some remuneration, which Miss Isaacs would never have withheld had it'not been for a ' little demon" behind her in the shape of an attorney. Mr. Justice CROwvDER then summed up to the jury, and said that the case had been called a complicated one; he thought it ought to have been disposed of in two hours if counsel had admitted facts which they might well have done, and not gone into extraneous matter. The main question was whether Miss Issacs entered into any contract with the plaintiff for -" leave money" to act his pieces, and next whether he was theauthor of such pieces ? The learned judge then summed up-the evidence most carefully and left a number of questions to them. The result of the answers of the jury was in effect a verdict for the defendant on all the main points involved in the cause, subject of course to any motion which the plaintiff mlay be advised to make before the court in1 baneco. Mr. Hoggins, Q.C., and MIr. Hance appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Hawkdns for the defendant,

POLICE. MA1ASION-HsOUSE.-Benjanin Stubbing and Jesse Lee, of Leadenhall-market, butchers, were sammoned before the Lor.D X,mIY0U by Charles Fisher, the meat inspector for the city, upon the charge of having exposed and offered for sale in the market certain meat unfit for human food, whereby they became liable to a penalty not exceeding 201. xr. Lee, one of the partners in the firm, attended to answer the complaint, and pleaded "sNot guilty," according to the usual form. The LORD MA1YO.-I consider myself bound, as a magistrate, to infietthee>trcnepenalty, andlatthesametime take this opportunity to declaro that in every case which may be br me in which evidence shall be given of the sale of bad meat I shall fine to the utmost extent. I hope it will go forth to the public, through the most convenient and useful channels, that such is the determination of the chief magistrate; and I have no doubt that my brother magistrates will act precisely in the same wiay. The Dlefendant.-I shall certainly appeal against the decision, my Lord; but I really think you may dispose of the case by allowing me to put a couple of pounds into the poorbox. y The LORD IDyoR.-lNot at all. This is no poor-box case. The Defendant.-You will not, my Lord, as a citizen of London, inflict such a penalty upon a fellow-citizen. I have committed no offence whatever. I trust your Lordship will deal summarily with the case. The LORD MAvoR.-I have dealt summarily with it. There must be an end put to such a traffic. Complaints of unwholesome food abound everywhere; and to allow a case of this kind to pass without marking it would be unpardonable. I shall in every future case that may come before me enforce the extreme penalty; and I am most anxious that the public should be informed of that determination. MAIMO.OOUGHI-STREET.-John Ingram Ovwen, George Smith Owen, and Edward Owen were brought before Mr. BnuGHAM for final examination, charged with numerous forgeries. The depositions, which are believed to b, the longest ever taken in this court, -were completed and read over to the prisoners by Mr. Bishop, the magistrate's clerk. The numberof cases on which the prisoners are committed amounts to 12, forming however but a small portion of the aggregate of cases which the police have been enabled to trace. The prisoners reserved their defence, and were fuUy committed. CrLF v =.-Edward Thomas, 56, a dirty-looking fellow, described on the police-sheet as a surgeon, and an inmate of Clerkenwell workhonse, was placed at the bar before Mx. TYPwH=, charged with mutilating the dead body of a man by cutting off tho head in Clerkenwell workhouse, under the folrowing circumstances:- It appeared from the evidence that the prisoner, who has seen better days, but who has been in the workhouse for muany years, has been employed in the dead-house as assist. ant-underaKer, one of his duties being to show the bodies to the relatives. On Monday he had the body of a man under his charge, but upon the relatives applying to see it the prisoner refused, saying that it was nailed down. The relatives then applied to see the matron, who insisted that the coffin should be undone, but upon looking round the dead-house she saw a man's head on the ground, and upon saying that she had now caught him the prisoner took up the head and said, "Do not let the relatives see it." The mnatterWaS then brought under the notice of the guardians, who determined to prosecute. MIr. TYnwvmTrr remanded the prisoner.

She returnedcat about half-past 12, and on roinguP to her bedroom she found-it as she had left it, ced, buton entering she saw a tea service of plate on her dressing table, which had been removed from the wardrobe. Sihe examined her drawers, and missed five valuable Iii whawLS and then called out toher tÃ¯Â¿Â½eyant, Elizx Deye, who came to her, and on entering the room, " seeing the state it was in, she lifted the valanoe of tb bed. and started out of the room screaming as loud as sbo could. A man instantly came from under the bed, ar& 3'arted down stairs. On leaving the house she closed tbe front door in the orainary way with the catch, and found it so on her return. The property produced was her-, an& had been removed from the place where it was ordinarily kept tra Dewe, in addition to a corroboration of her mia- tess's edence, said that on seeing tle prisoner under Ler mistress's bed she ran down stairs as last as she could, and, opening the front door, called out " Police" as loud as she could halloo. While so calling out she saw the prisoerr come out of the house, and had such a view of his face as t enable her to swear positively to his identity; she had not lost sight of him until he was secured and brought back.. In reply to the questions of the magistrate the witness vis" she had not been up stairs from the time her mistress adA her sister went out until they returned, and they came back much sooner than she expected them. Hler mistress wan disposed to let the prisoner go, and would have done so 1a it not been for the gentleman who lived next door, ,an while speaking to Mmrs Edmondsthe prisoner turned to her (witness) and said, " Some of your 'pals ' have been here."' The prisoner was a perfect stranger to her, and she had not> to her knowledge, ever seen him before. James Lennox, a bricklayer, said that on the day ini question he was passing the house of Mrs. -Edmonds, aul his attention was called to it by the loud cries of the last witness. lIe saw the prisoner rush out of the door and run away as fast as he could. Suspecting he had done some wrong, he (witness) followed, and had not lost sight of him until he secured him. The prisoner was very violent in his struggles to get off, and bit him (witness) so severely in the left hand that he was at present an out-patient of St. Thomases Hospital, When the prisoner was brought back to the house of the prosecutrix he heard him say that if be was let go he would go the back-way and show how be got in. Mr. Charles Weare, of 17, Addington-place% said that on the day in question be went into the hall of Mrs.-Edmonds's house, and hearing that lady's sister say " We have not missed-anything; let him go," ke interfered to prevent. the prisoner being allowed to go at large, when the prisoner made a desperate attempt to k-ick him, and drawing back ; little he received the kick on his abdomen. Police-constable Charles Sibston, 142 P, said that having been informed by Mnis. Edmonds that she had missed eoine shawls, he searched under the bed under which theprisoner had concealed himself, and there found the five valuable India shawls he then produced. The prisoner, who said mothing to the charge, was fully committed to take histrial for breaking into aud stealing is the dwelling-house of the prosecutrix, but atthe reguest or the officers was reman4ed to a future day, when they enpeat to establish another charge against him.
TIJRKEY. [The followiug appeared in our second edition of yesJLday-1Y_ (FROM OUR OS; C)W; COcRF.SrONnDFs-Sr.) CONSTANTINOPLE, MA.Y 19. Tius is a period of complete stagnation, as yo.t m:ay 3udge from the circumstance that the siibj act which just at this moment occupies the official w orld at Stamboul is the grand ball to be given by Aali Pasha to the Queen. This interest evinced .n a festival going on 3,000 miles hence is to be attributed not so much to the Allta Frunca tendency and European aspirations of official Turk-ey as to the wish of those in povwer to find some occupation for theirl rneasy minds during a time of suspense. They feel that by the ending of the war and the proclama. tion of peace their position has been entirely altered. The Mlinistry owedl its existence to the pressure of the moment and to the impossibility in -which others were- tempor; ily placed rather than to their own fitness to form a Government. It -would have beei scarcely possible to collect a Cabinet with ideas and -iews more different among its members. Like all *Ministries created by circumstances, it may be said to be a.collection of Ministers rather than a -Ministry in the European sense of the word. They have even up to a certain point emancipated themselves from the inf.uence of the MIinisterial Cotmcil, and every one is acting on his own hook, as an independent chief of his department. To iUlustrate this, I have only to cite one case. The BMinisters bor:ow money on their own account, not only -without the sanction -but wvithouit even the knowledge of the Ministerial Council. Thus, a short time ago the Loan Commissioners reported to the Kaimakan of the Grand Vizier that they had a balance of 33,0001. sterling in their chest in specie, sent ouit from England, and that they wvished to know how to dispose of it. The answer was, that they had better keep it untll the money was required. A few days ago M. Comundo, a native banker, appeared with a bill from theAlinister of War for 30,0001., for money bor'rowed at 7 per cent. and 2 per cent. commission just at the time when the Loan Commissioners notified to the Kaimakan their balance in hand, from which it appears that neither the Eaimakan informed the Seraskier of the surplus, nor the Seraskkier the Kaimakan that he was going to borrow. Tnis state of things coldc exist during the war, vhen the Var and ForeignDepartments monopolized, so to say, all affairs, and when the others were placed in the background, but it is diffictult to see howv now, when Europe expects to see reforms On a grand scale carried out, a M11inistry with members as disjointed as those of a marionette without a wire should be able to satisfy just expectations. A Mlinistry of circumstances and compromises, it has lived hitherto by concessions to the foreign Powers, to the Court, to its own members, and to every one else wvho 'was usefiul, or who might be dangerous ; but now the time of passive obedience has passed. Europe has guaranteed the integrity and independence of Turkey, and pledged herself not to interfere, or to allow anybody else to interfere, in her internal affairs. It is now for Tturkey to show that she is able to maintain this independence by correcting the abuses and remedying the evils which led to the necessity and possibility of foreign interference and protection. If they fail it will be a proof that the blood and treasuire of the West have been wasted in the pursulit of a shadow, and that the Emperor Nicholas was right. At no moment, therefore, was the necessity of a strong, united Government in Turkey, more felt than at the present. The return of Aali Pasha is therefore anxiously expected, for until he returns no decisive arramgement can of course take place. In the meantime the MIinistry seems firmly inlined to carry the resolutions of the HattiRumayoun into effect, and on Saturday last all the chiefs of the dissenting communities were calIed to the Porte to constilt how the article pro. mising the admittance of delegates of the different communities to the sittings of the Council of State vhenever matters of general interest are transacted there could be bestcarried into effect. Anyone wvho has read the Hatti Houmayoun with attention must have been struck by the dualistic principle of it. The doctunent begins by expressing the principle of perfect equality of all subiects of the Sultan, in pursuance of which indiscriminate enlistment and the admission of every one, without distinction of religion, to civil and military employments, are decreed. But, while thus one-half of the document starts from the principle of equality for all without distinction, the other half makes promises of maintaining the difference between the different religious communities and the Mahomedans, by acknowledging the former as distinct bodies, and enjoyingadditionaI privileges as such. To carry out bothis impossible. There must be either equality for all, 4s regards their civil and political rights, or else a class legislation. For instance, takle the case in question-namely, the admission of delegates of the non-Mahomedan communities into the State Council. If the indiscriminate employment of every fit.man, without difference of religion, be a truth, then why the privilege of the non-MIahomedan communities to be represented also by delegates as distinct bodies? Would it not be upsetting the equality ? It is evident that a decision must be made either one way or the other, and the fortune of Turkey depends on the decision taken in this respect; it is therefore interesting to watch the decision of the Government. The convocation of the chiefs of the non-Mlahomedan communities for the purpose of discussing the best way of admitting their delegates to the Council of State seems to indicate an intention to perpetuate the division between Mahomedans and non-Mlahomedans. I will not at present discuss the merits of this decision, for it would lead too far. I wish only to offer a few remarks on the admission of the delegates of the non-Mahomedan communities to the Council of State. Of all the tyrannies practised in the East, the worst is that exercised by the superior clergy of the different non-Mahomedan religious communities, nominally Greek. It is a facsimile of the rule of the Constantirlople Government over thle provinces, only more despotic, because under no control whatever. A clique of a few privileged families has usurped in each commuinity a kind of hereditary right of church govemenent, jealously excluding all itruders, and enjoying all the benefices. The members of this clique distribuite all the bishoprics and benefices among themselves, and administer church discipline according to their convenience, holdingup the thunder of excommunication as a threat to all thoPe who shall attempt to be refrac- tory. Dis.inct from this oligxarchy are the members of the inferior clergy. Although poor, uneducated, and scarcely betterthan the rayahs, andc without any chance of preferment, they work according to the lights given to them, advising and consoling, and living and suffering with their flocks, while the bishops come- only, sometimes ike pashas, in order to collect the greatest amount of money in the shortest pos- sible time, and to procure them the means of furur theringtheir interests at Stamboul. The admission, therefore, of delegates of the nonMahomedan com munities to the StateCouncil in the presentconditionof things wouldbe placing additional means of mischief in the hands of this oligarchic clique, and opening a new door for their intrigues. They would look to their own interests, and not to those of the communities, especially as the wvhole elams is high in favour -with the Turkish officials, lending them money, and being partners in sundry myS4,erious commerc-al transactions. It would be, in o7ne, w-ord, the perpetuation of the slavery in vwhich1 f-lue religious cliques of Constantinople holdt'aei f ellowr-believers in the provinces.t l If it be really irntended to give a voice to the griefs and complaints of the non-Mahomedan communities in the Council of State, we must begin by trying to refonr the presenit mode of church government, else the whole thing is a farce which may blind Europe, but which will scarcely deceive those who knowv the real state of the case, and which certainly will not benefit the religious communities themselves. According to news from Persia, 'Mr. Mlurray was on his road to Bagdad. An attempt has been made on the side of the Persian Government to arrange the difference with England by thLe mediation of the Porte. A commissioner, Mirza Malk;um Khan, has been sent for this purpose to Stamboul. There is only one strange thing in the matter-namely, that the envoy sent is a son of one of the most devoted supporters of Russia. I told you in my last that the Tturkish Government is offered the " pick" of all English cavalry and artillery horses wvhich it is not intended to take home, and they avail themselves largely of this opportunity, and have bought a good many horses from the different regiments. Those of the 10th and 12tlh have been offered at the round sum of 201. a-piece. The Turks first offered 151., then 161., and so on until they saw that it was of no use. I wrote to you about the opening of the first English church at Ortakoi. A great deal of interest was showvn by the English residents, as you may judge from the circumstance that a collection of more than 501. was made at the end of the service, which will be a valuable contribution to wards defrayino the expense of finishing the interior, which is not covered by the subscriptions. To maintain the church it is intended to rent the seats at ll. a year. The absence of the members of the Embassy at the opening of the chiurch has caused some talk. I am authorized by Mr. Stothart, chaplain of Her Mlajesty's ship Queen, and officiating clergyman of the new church, to state that the reason of this absence was one of those cont7retemps to which every one is exposed in this country who has to employ native servants. Lord and Lady Stratford had arranged to come in a carriage, on account of the heat, buit their Greek servants did not secure horses in time, and when the hour came none made their appearance. It was then too late to go in their usuial way in a caique. Lady Stratford and party came to the church last evening, and presented a handsome donation to the fund. The American MIinister sent a most friendly note of congratulation, and, unsolicited, gave a subscription of 1,000 piastres. Sir Colin Campbell did not go on Thursday, asI wrote; he deferred his departure, and is leaving to-day. Sir Houston Stewart arrived on Saturday, on board the Hannibal, from ialta. M. Paul Pisani, chief of the Russian Chancellerie at Constantinople, arrived the same day from Odessa, on board the Eglintoun, with several of his ern7pioys. A.mong the arrivals from the Crimea there are the 3d Bufs, who came in on Wednesday, on board the Acdelaide, and were transshipped on board the imperador, in which they left the same day. The Emperor came in, with Sardinians, on Thursday, and. stayed for one day before proceeding to Genoa. This miaorning the Ripon came in, with the 68th and two companies of the 46th on board. The 12th Lancers and a detachment of the 10th Hussars left yesterday.
