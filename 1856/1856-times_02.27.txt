The noble atd heurned lord said it would be proper to state that, in the 3atter part of the year ItSS2 and the beginning oalSwit, veiy trat cofiplaints were made in the manufacturing districts ef Enoland and Scotland, particularly at thanchester and Gthoul, that, with rgard to mnatters of everyday cVccu mtence, parties cngaLged in trade ercountered alidiculties that emal rrassed them, and in respect to which there ws no im ttediate we -oedy. Meet. lags were held at dfanchester, Gof srow, B m, eed, and other laretowns _ and petitions werccresented, prapig that the laws on the snbject might be aenilated. Erfdt it deirableh there should be one uniform law Iprvadingthe wholeof Great Britain and Irelad, butethat nmy atmispt to make nhe laso Scothend identi,anwith thosc of England must end ina filure, because the people of ScotLAndsAerenaturally attached to their owas lawigs,and thorgh he thought them generally not so good he w(as ready to demit that in some respects they iereoetter. The .law of Scotland being familiar to the pioDee of Scotland, ane attempt to alter its nature owf t be absurd and chsnerical; hot, at the same tie, that was not sedi- tent reason why diorerenes oF friequent occurrence on the borders should not be rectified5 or wshy useful Improvements, impossible to obtain in their integrity should not beobtained partidll. (Hear, hear.) A itoyal cotmte ion fwe s ied to inqanre into the ubect, and it was composed patly of lawyers, and partly of mercantile persons. Attl ee head o tha camnrnision was a distingushed 3awfer-the resent Master of the o in Ireland (er. Semtbv, and wth hima were associated an English judge, Mar. a stice Cresoamendi Scotch itdwe, Lord (luriehid , and twoe isters of high repute-i r. Bram. aell, now Baron nratmwrei, and tur. Anderson, wvho ld thed good fortune to possss a thor ough knowledge of thce laws of both contries. To thosepwere onited three gentlemen of great emoinence in comm erce- lrb oth on, presrdent of the Chamber ofCCommerce ea Glasgow r. Barley, president of the Chamber of Com-a merce at nchester, and Mr. Soiter, of the irm of Morin andpCo. theleesthoeuilayt , hebeUseved thatestedir. if u nitedskingdom. i order toaceran hadt thenievances vere andwhatremedymight be applied papers pointing ent the differences in the lra and requefting opinions how far changes 'were practicable, and, if practcable, how far dessrable, were sent to the Clambers o Commeryce, io ihe 3aw societies, and to sec pwivate indifiduils as were steposed to be able to throw Bghe upon the subject. At a e end of 12 months a vast number of answers had been reteioed, da ndpon those answers the coriinissoersproceeded to frame o report, recommending what changes it would be 41e5irable to accouspLish. To attempt to explam those changes would be witnhstesible, a, hey thougbt, useless, because they selated to a series of fragments of the laaw unconnected 'with each other and unlikely to arrest the attention of any one pho had not gone u trough the whole report. F1e had given full attenion to that report, and, althoenh jhe oula not say that he was prepared to concor in all se recommendations, he bad had two bills prepared-the one ltelng so much of tnge lanof gltand as was veintgroperlyeconmended to e assi oilated tathelaw of Scot d;and the other, fder th sanctioht of lord CuriehiDe, aseinilating the lawaot Scotlad to the Lo e of pngland, tothe e:rtent which he could recommend their lordahips to within,whate should lay those bills on the table, and tO tbeirors wotaldt after the had been circulated, ve tea second reading, he should then move that theybe referred to a select conmittee, to meet as soon to besshle after thexteryination of the circuiets bis nob friend, the Cl,ief Jnstice, would probebly afford his assiotance. *E tbere should be ad other very eminent lawyer in the house, whether for life or longer, he trusted to receive hisa assane alt and hisotperxnoble and lerned friends wrot ld, no doutt, givethe sbjecttheir bestatten. laon. e dia not mean that the committee shoured cnmist thntiey of laWiers. He should be gade to see some noble Jo'ds connected with Scotlanduypa itr and, if they were not familiar with the sobject, they could he the organs of coun nunication fronm others, should any of the dlterations be deemtedrinexpedient or useiessthe sole object being to ylace the lav in toe statemmost convebient to persons en- aged of trade betwxeen the two ingxdoms. bpon one subsect it was surprioing there should e on thie borders, such a difference in the larei s actalgy existed. He alluded to siLls of epetanged In 3 engln the holder ws in the lirst cebound to apply to the acceptor for poyment, and, if heacceptor Wliletxtoepay, then he could hve reconrse to thme other partis-to the drnwer or endorser, promded that within what the laScallead a reasonable time, hegave notice to thote persons that the acce tir had failed to make Pay. nent. A reasonable time hba long been settled in England to be the day er n ext day after the bil was presented, but jn Scotland 14 days weme given, and it must ofe n happen that poor persotson the botrders 'whonthe laws ougit T protect, ere not aware of the difference, thought they nab 14 days to give notice and losttheright to applyto any f theother parties. On the other hand, in Scotland, to have recoure to other parties a bill mus lie protested, but that was not necessary in ruge land. In both eSnectS the comnissiOnerS reconmended that the lawr in Scoeland. should be made to codforin to that in England, and it certainly was very desirl0e, wheher the tmlel as14 days or two days, thst there should be one aniforng rue. (hear,ehear.) Connected with the samed sb jcet there were points on which the laws of beth lingdoms eught not only to he asim lated, but g rds Tth accept- ance of eabill of exchange might formerly belmde, either y writing on the face of the bill, by writing on another TBece of paper, or even verbally. By an cet passed in the 1mrst year of the reign2 of George IV., it ws enacted that the seceptance to inland ils of exchange should not be alid 'hless the acceptance n w as in writing on thie bill itself, and that had been found to be extemely con. wVenrient. With regard fo foreign bilhs, thlere eight be acceptance by andtiCpation by writiDg, or by mere word of meouth as far as ScotUand was concerned, and et was pro posed to bhe oly one ruie in the united kingdom-that acceptance of bilos,t hetheteiver fgnors English,s should be we wlriting on the face of the bimlltsef. In ;en Iand, if a Zuli were transferred bz7 endorsement, after it is-as due, nte person to whom anot was transferred only took the same rigo t sbihe person traheir eing g it, for the obvioas reasonthat,if it had been paid, the transfer'should not enable the person receiving an overdue oill, to enforce -palnient again That 'was rot sO in Sco,,land, and the 1enez,aolners recommended strongly that theptsaroul rule Xhould be adopted. (Hear.) With regard to contracts for the prhase df goods, w n gad if the seller failed to delier, the purchaser couldt only bring his action for Jamages for the brzeach of contract, but in Scotland the purctser, as in the case of real estate in wnglsnd, conld ob'.in a decree that ths specific roods, whether cotton ar wheat, should be delvered, an if the seller failied, llen that he shoud snake Tgoo the deficency by dawgnwes. 5cnat asu recodhmended by the comioners,i and he could see n.o eason why a simiar role shoula d notrbe adopted here. There was now aproceeding under the common law pm ecedure, by which inQ a case 'where chattels were detained *the party c laiig coulid oobtin judgmnent to compel thie oloker to deliver them aTp, and the cercunissioners believed tat-rouldhbceasyto frameazclause to apply a simirar rale i'Q respect of con traicts to delivier goods, and idr.Baon Eranswell had framed A clau se to meet that obj<ect. In snothier matter there -was aIn a nomaly in Scotch lawP with respect to carrieras, 'who'were responsible for accidents whdch happened to goods while uinder thceir charge, except in case of fr.The £ommsiioners -coul d not see twh there should ibe flint difference, and recommended that the exception shoulidbe abolished. With respect to shippin g, th ere was a rulo which nlow prevailed, that wrhen the owner of a ship resided in what wa termed a foreignt port, if reparbeamne necesvsar,the cnptain of the vessel rimlcatioQ of law had auLthority to perforrn the repairs a t the owEner's expense, but nLot so when the owner reidedr at wrhat was raled a home port. The question had arisen, whxat conAstituited a home port, and he believed the best trats were reduced to 'writing. and wasw f opinion that the change proposed by tIe conissioners wonid be distastefal to the mercantile communityofLondoi If upon examination it should appear thst the balance of advantages would te to reverse the reconmnendation of the commissoners, he (the Lord Chancellor) would be quite willing t4 strike the clause ont of tho bill. Having stted the recommendations upon which he had acted, he would next advert to one or two matters in which he had not been able to atgree with the consniasonerm According to the law of Scotland a. minor, that wn a person above 14, but under 21, could enter into trade and make contracts ralating to trade to any extent, so that S. boy of 15 might involve him5dtf in speculations to euch an extet as to swalow up all the property to which he might succeed on attfaining 2!1 years of age. He(the Lord Chancellor) did not feel sufficiently confident of the advantages efthat law to recommend its adoption in England. Again, in Scotland, married wainen conld bind themselves as partners in trade, but tie commissioners did not recommend, the extension of that ptinciple in EngLand. They had, howreves recommended, and he had adopted, an ateration in tho la of prescription relating to mercantile contracts in Scotland, vrhich everyone admnitted to he in a mest cornpEcated state'. The commsioners pro. posed to adopt the limit, asim England, of Six yeais and a clalse had been framed with that view. Upon showing the bill, howvetr, to his hon. friend the lord-Advocate, that leared gentleman conedived a difficulty would be prodoced by confining hie change to mercantile contracts, and had undertaken to introduce, in the present session, a bill of a more m hi desciption, en gemodelling thehla of pescription in Scotland. Again, tchere was anotherglaw ind coland which d6dnotappear tobeconformable to goodasense, w hich required certan facts to be proved an witing. Thns, .paynent could not be proved, escept by wiotng-arle which ahaprd to be exceedingl inconvenient, and X clause hal been ftamed o alter thot rulebut, as the Lord-Advocate thought the lawv generalth shoul be amended, the clause had been struce out. There were other minor changes, but he had enplained the general natute of the bills which he sought to introducf, one of which was to amend the laws relatingto trade and commerce in geneand and Itdeand, and the other to amend the atin telating to trade andeommerce in Scotnd. those bills he now asked to be read a fist time, and, upon the occasion of theit second reang, aweek orten dais later, he should move to refer them to a. select commnittee, in which he should be most happy to receive any assithance in order to produce measues pwhich tould hcuseful and satisfactory to the com. munity. I.ordBBOThGHAld hihly approved the course 'which had been talen by his noble and learned friend in having, in this ince, departed flom the genetrl le adopted by their lordships in introducing a. bill fora rst reading withto enteurig into any argsument in support of its prov. sius. cowever good that rule might be in regard to Lills in genera, yet, when it was proposed to make an alteration in ths law affecting the mercantile interests of the country, it ioas a matter of great convenience that some statement should oe made at the earliest stage -in order that public attention should be attracted to it. He aproved of its being proposed to legislate on thi important subject. Their lordhips would remember that in the mon,th o£fNovemXber, 1S52, a very important congress of persons from all parts of the country-Englaud, Scotland, 'andrIreland-sat to takeinto consideration the s abject of ttassinilating the mercantile law of the three poions of the united kiudom. A commission was atrwards appointed lto inqure mnto the subject, and the result of the inquiries of that cormission was the report which formed the founda-gtion of the measures nof proposed to their lordships; nany of the recommendations cortanedin that report were exceedinglw fit tobe adopted by Parliament, and al of thenm were worthy of being made the subject of foil and continuwous diseusseon. There were many other bils necessary to bedintrodueed in order to assimilate the commerrial law and many other lawSs that were now at variance t b Lod C B ELL ese i eteampr'otion of the measures poposed bys noble and learneo friend. The c fommercia lawr ought to be strictly the same in all parts of the united kingdom, and hethought itmighthoeeasily accom- GI - oean, butthere whethera hisroble and learned friend EsLord sroughbmj had observed, many other branches of the lawwhich might with advantage be assimiated The hawwith regard toShe transfer of property, as it existed in Scotland was much more simple, an much more more economical than um e laf on the same subject ti England. Then, again, the law with respect to the onutracts of minots nd married omen s essentialldifrent in the two eountries, rimd an asilation of which might be effected without inconvenience. w Bh t the la of casige was one which required immediste attention. In Scotland the law, or rather the no lva on that subject, made ib imposiible for many persons to say whether they were married or not, amd not one child 50, trom Carlisle all round the coast of Seotland to the German ocean, knew whether he was legitmate or not. These w?ere subjcts demaedingithe early attention of Perliament. phe bilns were then read a firsrtim e. COSVIC?IS.-TICEETS OF T$EAVE. Vscount of hiIe Ganaia moved for a return of the number of convictsewhe to whomgticlets of leave bad c eme gatnted; asd also the nrumber of convicts who saein recerving such tickets of leave hadrtusrned to their former course of crimes,-specifying the character' of the crimes wth which they had been charged or convicted of. airl GRANit.LE said there was no objection to grant the returns aoved for, but he begged to itform the noble viseounwtthat simlar returns bad been atodered d thab laid before the other house of Parliament. to be tiscomr t c)ueGratioN said that those retuss wolud ansler his purpose. He would nOw ask the puestion of which he hatogien notice on the subjectwhetiher it was the intention of Hex a ix aesta a Goverlnment to continle giving tickets of leave to convicts? nte obelie red it was a well-knovnpfact tsat a ery considerableproportionof these persons had, since their liberation, returned to their former course of crime, and it wsA shown by proceedings at quarter sessions and elsewhere thaty throughut te couatrb cases of the imert attrocious character had been ticated in oy them. (nt ear, bear.} It seemed to hin that tm ke ticheteof-eov system, so far froum having been attended with any good resolt, had proved most mischievous in its ten ency and productive of serious evils. thear, hearJ e coln d not, therefore, forbear frohm asking wat were the intentions of the Gtovernmena, wishing it, at the sameiime to be understood that, should the auserhereceived be unsatisfactory, it was his intention, after thle production of the returns which had been moved for intheotherhouse of Parliament, to bring under the consideration of their lordships some resolution bearng ulpon the subject. (Hear.) e Barl GOA.ATYB said, it was nut in the tower of the Government to make any alteration in the tickaertf-leave system withont anract of Parliament, and he counldory state that it was not their intention to bring in any bill for that purpose. I otgt Db qGuesOln whished the awer he had jlst received had been of another character, for he fldt assured that the yt as it now exted, tended largely to the increase of crnme, and crime, too, of the worst possible descnipthon. (nHear, hear.) Throughout the conntry he bewleved the rsentemcas niversallyocondennnea, and he hoped I that for the good of eociety some attempt wTould be made Ito remedy the evil. The L1s of SALISBURY thonght the noble earl e to hardlean fo say that nothin could he done by ithe Government without an act of l'arhament. It was surely intheir power,cithont any legislative interferenpcs to make such alterations in the system as would, if not weholly remedy, at teast very muac mitigate the evil complaied of. For example, an act of Parliament ws nut necessary to pot these convicts when turned out of prison more ndaer thea urtlince of the police than they were atpresent. ArHsear-) Besides the crinses committed by these persons, The sedcedo of MALgood character ito the same career and etthe worklng of the system, epe in the rural districts, was open to the most seriouls objetion. The EGarl of HARROWVBY said, that naturally, if no transportation wias allowed, criminals, after a. certamn period of imprisonment, most eturnedoutagain upouthe country It might be a question whether they were not let loose upont society too soon; liut it coud hardly be said |that they would be likely to do less mischief sitliout whatb was called a ticket of leave -than they |did now in spite of this precaution. Be did not see howz, if tnportatiorn were no longer po.ssible, the evils attending the necessary release of eriinala in this country when their .entences expired could lie chareable altogether upon the ticktet-of-leave system. The 'whole question, however, was a most dificult onle, and if any suggestions could be offered involving a practical improvement acon the pre,sent mode of proceeding, he was sure they would be ghily received andateduapon by the Secretary of State for th I Home DXepartment. .-- The Earl of ht&LESBUR consdered the speech of the noble earl {of Harrowby2) to be one of the most laLrniing he had ever heard in his life. The noble earl doclareditwsrsperfectlyimnposibletoretrce our steps with regard to transportation. The Earl of EA~OW BY.-NQo; - merely said, that La great portion of the evils attributed to the present system arose from the fact that, having abolished transportation, ou rcriminls mus, sooner or later, be turned upon the I countr. Th1°eEarl of IILhESBlUBY had understood the noble ertonfrtat our laws were lile the laws of the Medes and Persan, andthat it'wasimpossiblefor us to return to ,the sytem od transportation. He hoped their lordshirjs iwould. not coincide wit any such axiom, because he consideetil hywr onl now mknvan exoeriment in this transportation would orT Would not succeed. (Hesr,,hear.

With regard to the medical district; and the salaries of the medica officers, those were matter; not mmediately nder the control of the Poor l,aw Board. they being settled in the first instance by the guardians; but the recommendations of the committee had been attended to by-he Poor Law Board, who had directed tSh guardians to take ito consideration the carrying out of those objects; and considerale increase was going on in tha amount of the allowances to the medical officers.

THE CllIfEAN COMSSIONi O1F }NQIRY. Sir D.

The three sttements appeared to him to be altogether irreconelleable. The noble lord at the head of the Goversiuseut adniited that such- documents had beenofpesented bythe commissioners; that they werh very Sefi and had bteI sent to the medical depWrtment; bot tha do-was no thought advisable to lay ithemr on the table of the hou he Under aryfor War, in reply to a similarquestion,. hst4ate that the reason why the doca ments w ere not placed on tho ible of the house wams, that the cornecoters had difered inopinion as te tiepropriety of presenting them; while, on the other hand, the noble Secretary forathe War Depabytent snadthat thewhole of the documents and evidence, in al their integrity, would helid on the table of he house.

AN he could say w!as, thst he repeated whit Lord Panmure told hia to be hi impression of what took place in an interview between him nmd the commissionerS. It was possible that Lord Barnmura might have beennmistaken; but itwas clear that the returns oughb to form a separate paper, and nbt be included inthe report; and the objection to their publication dwas precisely the same as that stated by his noblo friend at the head of the Goernrment.

Major REED asked whether the attention of the Waroffice had been called to the alleged riotous and insubordinate conduct of certain soldiers of the British German. Legion, stationed at Shorucliffe; whether it was true that a' colision had taken place between the police (aided by the inhabitants) and the soldier, in which several persons were severely injured ; that the Riot Act was read andhpplication made to the- camp for assistance; that drunkenness psevailedtoa di<"racefnl extent, ana in some cases the men had refused to ohey their officers; and, if so, whetherany and what means had been taken to prevent the recurrence of such dan6erous proceedings? Mr. pFER said, it appeared that there had been some misunderstanding between some of the soldiers of the German Legion at Shorncliffe And the police at Folkestone. One of the soldiers having been taken usp and sent to prison, some of his comrades on the following day attempted a rece, whichwas put a stop to by means of a detacbment from the tamp at hsornclffe. Nothing farther passed, and no renewal of the disturbance need be apprehended. Au is.u quiry was going on wvith the view of bringing the ringleaders to punishmnent. With respect - to the statement as to the great prevalence of drunenness, that, as far as his knLowledge went, waa wholly unfounded. , COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ERZEOID AND TREBIZONDE. Mr. EWART asked the First Lord of the Treassury whether it would be within the views of the Government to emnploy its inluence with the Ottoman Government to promote the construction of a serviceable road from Trebizonde to Erzeroum as a means of opening the centralparts of Asia to commerce an) manufactures ? Lord PALMERSTON said that Her iMajesty's Goverment had for several years been urging the Turkish Go: vernment to construct a road between Trebironde and Erzeroum. The reasons alleged for nob undertaking this important work had been the want of adequate mneans to cover the expense, hut very recenltly the mnost urgent repre-| sentations had been addressed to the Turkish Government astoithe absolute necessity, not merely n a commercial but in a mnilitar point of viewr, of completing that road. THE EAST INDIA COMPANrS LAW EXPENSES "IN RE DYCE SOMBRE." Mr. OTWAY asked the President of the Board of Control whether he was aware of the proceedings that had taken place in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury "Is re Dyce Sombre," and of the judgment of the Judge, the Right Hon. Sir J. Dodson-, and, whetheT the Court ofi Directors of the East Iudia Company had the power to disburse generally moneys from the revenues of di for an object or objects, including the diseharge of law costs and expenses incurred by them in this country, without his sanction and anthority? Jr. V. SMTH said, with regard to the hon. zentlemar's fist question, he had no further knowledge of te proceedrugs "'In re Dyce Sombre" thau that which was to be derived from the public prints. With regard to the second part of the question, the East IndiaCompany had certainly a.ot the general power alluded to by the hon. member- but, ly the act of the 3d of William IV., cap. 35, the iard cf Control was precluded from sending anyquestion to the I Court of Dirctors with rgarl to their law expenses, and I from inquiring into any communications between the board I and its solicitor. Whether that provision apphed to an spensive law suit, such as theone alluded to, was a ques1ion for the House to determine, and which he would take (are to have inquired into. MIr. OTWAY.-Am I to understand that the comiany can incur any amount of expense, say 100,000t., without theauthority of the Board of Control, provided it cormes nuder the head of 3a r expenses?s fr. V. S.MiTH.-That depends enUirely upon the inter- I pretation of the act.I THIE IOCAL DUES ON SHIPPING BILL. In answer to Mr. IIeDSAY, Mlr. LOW said, it had neverbeen intended to confer any i power on the Board of Trade by this bill to apply taues raised at one port for the benefit of another port. Neither had it been contemplated to apply the moneys. vised at any post to any other purpose than thep enetof jebts,- +.- shipphgpepoac tebe,orswbere theywere evied, and if they were to be applied to shipping purposes they wvould be administered by the harbour aulthorities, and not by the Board of Trade. All thlat the Board of Trade required wo>uld be ml estimate of the niannerin which any particular suin was to be expended, in order tognard against any of those dues being applied to purely micipal purpOSeS. THE CRIME kw COM5ISSION. Sir R. PAXrINGTON gave notice that, in the event of the lion. and learned raember for ShefReld bringing on the motion of svhich he had given notice on this subject as a substanitive motion, or in any other form which would give hhn (Sir J. Pakington) the opportunity, he should move, as an amendment to it, t e foUlowing resolution - , That, in the opiniont of this House, the reports of Sir Jobn IlNefil ant t;olonel Tolloch ought to have been sub mitted to the Cominauder-in-Chief before they werepresented to Parliament, whereby Her Mfajesty's Goveruluent might have avoided the objectionable proceeding of appointing a commission to inquire, without equal or adequate means of information, into the conclusions atwhichlanother commisson had arrived; and, while this House laments the indication thus given of a want of that coucert and cooperation between the offices of the Secretary of State for War and the Commander-in-Chief which cannot be interrupted without serious injury to the publie service, it has also observed with regret the premature appointment to posts of importance in this country, while the inquiry of the commissioners -was still in progress, of officers whose conduct is impugned by the said reports." ' I Mr. ROEBUCK asked whether there was any objection to lay the names of the coimissioners before the House, together with a copy of the commuission under which they were appointed. Lord PALMESTON said, he then held in his hand copyof the Royail warrant constituting fthe commission, which he was just about to lag on the table. The na;mes of the commissioners were Lord 'eaton,GeneralM'3thon, Lord Beauchamp, General Rowan, Sir John Bell, General Peel, andGeneral Ensollys. - TIHE NAWAB OF SURAT., Sir F. LLY withdrew the notice of motion which he had placed on the paper for leave to introduce a bill to declare the rights of the heirs of the awab of. Surat, under the treaty of. lS00 between the late Nawab and the East India Company, stating at the same tinme his intention of introducing a prsvate bfl on the subject, in which shape, he was informed on the highest authority, the question ought properly to be laid before the House. PERSONAL ESTATES OF MIARRIT WOMEN Mr. MABINS obtained leave to bring in a bill to enable. married women to dispose of reversionary interests in personal estate. DECORATIONrS FOR INDIAN CAMPAIGNS. On the motion of Mr. D.usoassD, a retur was ordered of the names of all officers who were honourably mentioned in-the despatches of Lord Gough for their services under his command ; also, the namies of those officeas who received brevet promotion. THE JOSEPHINE WvIiES. Mr. S RUSSELL moved that the reports of MIr. Yardley, Lthe stipendiay magistr.te, and of Captain Robertson, the assessor, with the evidence takenx before them on the late collision between the Josephine Willis and the hlangerton ateames, presented to the Board of Trade, be laid onx the table oE the house. I Mr. LOWE said, he had no objection to the production of the reports, but he should oppoee the produzction of the evidence.' It consisted of three thick volumcs, the printing of which would cost the country about 200D. At the same time any one who wished could see it at the Board of Trade and make extracts from it. - IMr. RUSSELL having consented to withdraw the latter part of his motion, - I A copy of the report vas ordered to be lid on the table. - WAYS AND MEANS. The report of the resolutions agreed to in Comunittee of Ways aud Means was brought -up and adopted. LOCAL DUES ON SHIPPING BILL. On the order of the day for the resumption of the adjourned debate on this bill being read, - Lord PA TLERSTONsaid,- am anious to state to the Housethecoursewhich ler MIajesws Goverinment have, upon full deliberation, deemed it their duty to pursue in regard to the measure now under consideration. That mea- tre wasproposed to Parliament after a full consideration of the nmatters to which it. refers. Her Majesty's Govern.' ment felt that the burdens imposed upon the shipping and upon the industry of the country by the 'duties and imposts to which this bill relates wre matters which deserved the att-ention of Parliament, and were disadvantages from which those interests ought to be relievecd (Hear, hear.) * With tbat view the measure which is now before the House was introduced. - In the discussion which: hs taken plce nothing has been acddnce'by the opp6nents of the mneasure which has in any deree siaken the confdence of 'the Governmeht inthe justiceandthepolicy of .thecourse whlqich they pursaed. (A latkugh.) It is notfiting that I should now enterinto the arguments which haie been urged, .but I think it ight to record that the judgmeht of the Government has not ben shakei eit3her as o the question or a to that of policy. In the course of the discussion, however, it Ia been made manifest that in the cas of the towns which will be affected by the measmire there are a greater variety of circumstAnces rnd a greater complication of iatere thla thc Government had been led to suppoee. {A aUgh ndehers.) These are atters which, as every gentlemUn .W Mee i"Od be very imperfecUy and ineonveniutly deat with in' committee of the Whole' -Rouis. lh cona0dctinf debate in such a committee, it i5 imnpossible to degl with particular 4se, ipecially it they are complicated by a gret variety of i cmatinces, in sucha,manneraatobe eithersatactoryto the gouse or jusI to the parties concerned. This bill consists of two part*, !on rcore simple, the other more complicated; 'ouel to - pasing tolls, the other to dEes paid o townh With refer-enuo to the -latter part of the feasire, the towns in. terested would evidently be entitled to -male miny :and VaiOus representations. Indeed, my right hon. friend! the Vice-Presidentf othe BoLrd of Trade stated yesterday that in the cases of the two towns, Hul and Bistol, -circustauces had, within the las few days, been represented to the Board of Tade which led that board to think that speealprovisi- ought to be made for these cuses. These or similar provisions it would be exceedingly difficult to adapt to tho cirCumstances of theso o X otehirtown in a committee ef the wrhole House. Considering, therefore, the great difflerence of opinon which exists in the, house as to this portion of the measure, and considering that it is the duty of Her Majesty's Government not to call apon the House to bestow its time and attetion upon any mcasure in the manner in wbich it is least likely to tome to a just and satisfactory conclusion, the Government have de- cided that it world be more consstent with the pablic: convenience and interest, and more likely to lead to a clear wnderstanding of, and a saiisfactory conclusion on,these points if these complicated details with regard to difierentialdutiesand town dues were referred to a select ommnittee. (Hear, hear.) I should hope that such apropos3l. when made, the House would deem it to be its duty to adopt. Thesubjectisnowina position in whichitcannot rest (hear), either with justice to the towns concerned or with satisfaction to the public. Investigation isreqaired, kna that investigation can, in my opinion, be best conducted by a select committee of this House. For that purpose it would be useless that Her Majesy's Government should wish the House to continue at present the considera. tion of the bill now before them-the course mosb respectful to the Honse, and most consistent with the public interest Will be to withdraw that bil (cheers), in order that tho Government may take the whole subject into consideration, may refer to a select eommittee those matters of complicaied detail to which I lave aluded, and may see whether the simple matter of the passing tolls cannotbe made the subject of a separate bill, to be prepared for the consL deration of the House. (Hear, hear.) Upon these grounds, and feeling that nothing can be less becoming in a Governmeit than to cal upon this Houeo to discass matters of greet public interest and leadingto wiae divisions of opinion without seeing their way to an early, clear, and satisfactory conclusion, I propose that leave should be given to vithdra* this bill. (Hear, hear.) Mfr. DISRAlL-I have heard with satisfaction -the declartion of Her Majestys Government. After the disaScion of last night0 when the alarmingcharacter of the bilibefore the House was beginning to be understood, and when its propositions, in themselves so alarming, were supported by the member of the Government to whom their advocacy was intrusted in a speech more ealculated than any other to which I have ever listened in this hosse to disturb and alaum the public mind (cheers) and to unsettle that confidence in prescription which has hitherto been one of the most considerable sources of the stability and security of property and order in this country, I felt it my duty to Impress upon the House the expediency of coming to a speedy conclusion, and of not postponing to the day then proposed by the noble lord, a decision which I am sure would have been awaited with great anxiety by the publi9, and the delay of which I thought would be injurious to the ypubli interest. Therefore, I hear with great satisfaction that the noble lord has thought fit to withdraw this measure; and, remembering the debate -which took place Inst night, remembering that, although the amendment 'was moved by an hon. and learned friend of mine on this side of the house, no character of a party controversy was imparted to that discussion, I think it will be a source of great satisfaction to the public that the discernment of the House of Cormmons should have prevented what would have been the iniurious conseqttences of the crede and thoughtless projects which were about to be carried with so much facility, andtobe eempted from full and mature consideration. I cannot quite undertand the view which the noble lord t&kes of the position of the Government with respect to this measure-projected, buxt now withdravn. I understood the noble lord to say that Her 3&jesys Government would not- JaUA felt instilled in bringing forward this importanft arnd comprehensive measure had they not given to it all the consideration Which so important a project requited (cheers); but before he concluded his observationslwas at aloss tonderstand to what point. the Goverament had addressed this considetation. The noble lord says that the bill is divided into two parts. Te first reters to t'he subject of passing tolls; the other-and the noble lord spoke of it almost as a secondary part-refers to local and difMerential dues, acording to the nohle lord a more complicated portion of the business. 2Xrow. Sir, no one who has read the bil cat suppose that the subject of passing tolls required very deep or prolonzed consideration by Her Majesty's Government. That subject is one that bas been much considered, that has. beeni thoroughly understood, and with which the House has long been,- I 'may @ay unanimously, prepared to deal I myself, nearly thrce years ago, proposed to the House a measure on this subject, which even at that period of great party excitement was received with general favour. 7Under these circumstances, I cannot think that the greatconsideration said to have been given to tbissubjectby Her Majesty's dnisterswas demandedby that portion ofthe subjectwhich refers to passing dues. If not, it must of course follow that the profounad consideration for which the noble lord took credit in the name and on behaY of the Government mist have been directed to thit portion of tho bill which relates to local and differential dues. Yet we find themn dislodged from that position also (bear), for it appears from the speech of the noble lord that upon al circamstances connected with, local rates and differential dues the Government were in a state of hopeless ignorance til they had heard the debate which took placein this house last night. (lear, hear.) It is but natural to suppose that the Board of Trade must have devoted the most minute and careful attention to this question. That department is now represented in Her Majesty's Cabinet. Recently it was not so ; but at the present moment it is pesonated in the X Cabinet, and we have now before us the fruits of that happy consummation. (Hear, hear.) The Board of Trade being represented in the Cabinet, it follows that the Government musb have had at their command the most authentic and authoritative information on this subject to assist them inl tbat elaborate consideration to 'which the noble lord refers in so triumphant atone. ("Hear, hear," and laughter.) It is but reasonable to conclude that theo must have had I rapid access to the mest trustworthy sources of information * yet wehave the authority of the noble lord himself for the statement that it was only afew hours ago, and upon the very eve of the debate, that the position of two of the most imnportant cities and orts of the kingdom -with re- . Iference to local and differental, dues 'was for the first time made k;novn to the Government. (Hear, hear.] What, then, becomes of the deep consideration-the profound and ample consideration (alaugh) which, according to the first Ninister of the Cro*n, this question received at - the hands of Her bjesty's Government before tbey felt authorized to introdace it to the notice of the Howse?

But I am. greatly inclined to suspect, from the tone of the speech which we have just heard, that if the dicussion of this measure had been coutinued to-night it would not have been allowed to terminate in the exemplary spirit in which it commenced. mear, hear.) I apprehend that the address to which we have just listenecl from the rignt hon. gentleman would have undoubtedlyformed a part of that entertaining oration of whieh we havez unfortunately been deprived by the piemature suspension of this debate; and, therefore, I must be permitted to say that. I think that oration would not have been wnting in a- eat an infusion of party bitterness, personal hostility, andt appeals founded on topics totally extraneous to the imme-diate question under considestion as it has ever been myfate to witness in any debate in this house. (Hear, hear.). The right hon. gentleman says te felt bound to interpose on this occasion in order to protect the Teputation of Her Majesty's Government.

"My dear Friends,-Thie address you have jnst prcsented to me on behalf of yourselves and the tenantry of the Salters' Estate fills me with an overwhelming sense of heartfelt gratification; and the deep tone of friendly affection which pervades it is even more touching than the very flattering manner in which you express your opinior of me as your late landlord. F For -upwards of a century my family and myself have stood in that position, and during that period the mprovemnent of the estate has been progressive and immense. I have documents in my possession which show that when my grandfather purchased the property a large portion of it was a mere wilderness, covered with rocks, stones and brushwood, and that for a considerable time the renti was nearly all expended in reclaiming 'waste land, building honses, and endeavouring to create a respectable tenantry; but, morethan all this, thepleasing fact remains that the connexion which has existed between us for three successive generatioiis has been blessed and cemented by feelings of mutual confidence and goodwill, which have never been impaired. " I confess it ws to me a sourca of hones pride to have handed back to the Salters' Company their estate with its conditionio much improved,'its resourCes so developed, and with a tenantry inferior to none in the kingdom for intelligence, enterprise, and respectability. "From my own personal knowledge of the Salters Company ('with whom save so long been on terms of thentmost coriNlty and friendship), I have the additional satisfaction of believing that they 6wl adhere to the same line of conduct which has met with your approval, especially when I find they have continued to intrnst the management of this great property to our excellent and ]ustly respected friend, Andrew Sipotswood, Esq. " At the close of a long life no reflection is so soothing as the consciousness of having endeavoured (with the help of the Almighty) to do some good in the station of life in which He has placed us, and your welcome assurance of having ex}erenced some things worthy of your gratitude and affection makes me venture to hope that my endeavours have not been altogether in vain. I If in 42 years, during which time I was placed in the position of your landlord, I have been able to encourage mdustry and enterpris, to, mitigate in some degree the dnstress and hardships which mnst always exist, more or less, in every community, and particularly at the time -when it pleased God to send famine and pestilence among us, and also to assist you in obtaining for your children the advantages of sound religious and secular education,-if I have succeeded, however slightly, in these objects, beieve me, I amaply rewarded. "iAlow me, however, to return my most sincere and grateful thanks for this most acceptable testimony of your esteem and approbation, and to assure you that Ishall ever cherish the remembrance of our long and intimate connexion, and continue to take the most affectionate interest in your wefre and prosperity. -I remain, gentlemen, with those sentiments of esteem and regard which you so warmly reciprocate, "'Your faithfu l and devoted friend, "RtOBER"T BATESON.

MOfOfbWARAZTand CITY INTBELMOBNOB. Tue-masy Evening. Vhe quotation of geld at Paris is about 6 per BOiOUe prmiuim (aording to the last tariff), which, at the English Mint price of 31. 137s. 10j. per oz. for xtandard gold, gives an exchange of 25.32; and, the exchange at Psris on London at *hort being 25.37i, It followsw that gold is- about 0.22 percent. ~dearer inLondon than in-Pais. of g AByadvicee from Ramburg the price of gold is 426i per mark, which, at the English Mint prico of S3 17B. 10d. per oz. for standard gold, gives an exciange of 13.5; and, tho exchange at ILamburg on London at short being 13.7j, it follows that gold is 0.70 per dent. dearer in London than iu Jlamburg.; -The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 da' sight is 109 per cent., and, tho par of exchange between England and America being 109 23-40 per cent., it follows that the- ex. change is nominally 0.58- per cent. against England; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between the two countries. The news this morning of tho conclusion of an armistice until the 31st of MIarch caused the English funds to open at a further advance of three-eighths per cent., which in a great measure was supported to the close of business. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 91;[, were first quoted 92 to The sudden rise brought in a few sellers, and a decline occurred to *911. At a later hour the market regained its firmness, and the closing transactions were at 91i to 92- for rmoney, and 92k for the llthof Marclh. Owing. to tho large sums set. free by the return of the. surplus deposits on the new loan, the supply of money in the StockExchange was much better than on any oceasioni for some time past, and short advances on Government securities were obtainable at from 4 to 5 per cent. Consol scrip ranged between 14 and 2k premium, and thelast price was 17 to 2k. Exchequer scrip left off at 1i premium.

A eonsiderable~ numnber were forfeited fornon-paymentof calls, and some time back, in order to avoid unneessay sacrifices, the. company obtaned power to raiSe 100,0001. ondebentures or obligations. They required the signature of two directors and the secretary, and Mr.. Sadleir, having obtained possssion of the unissued quantities for the purpose of completing them with his signature, seems to have got rid of them in the Stock-Exchange, or in any quarter where he could raise money. The nominal amount thus made.away. with is reported to range between 200,0001. and. 300,001., although probably the advances he received upon them were not more than a fourth or a third of that total. The ease is nearly analogous to the fraudulent issue made a year ago at New York by Mr. Scbuyler of a large number of shares of the New York and Newhaven Railroad, of which he was president, and which, owing to the company having contested their liability, has ever since been before the law courts of that State. The actual extent of overissue will, it is expected, be speedily made public, the directors having instituted an inquiry, which has been earTied on by MIessrs. Broom and Co., the accountants, and the results of which will be communicated to a general meeting of the shareholders, which has just been summoned for Friday next, at the London Tavern. With regard to the East Kent Railway, it is stated that, with the exception of some arrears of cals, Mr. Sadleir is not directly indebted to that undertaking. In his capacity of deputy-chairman, however, he induced the board to deposit 8,OO0l. of their unemployed capital wFith the Tipperary Bank on deposit notes, which fell due at the beginning of last week and were dishonoured. In the ease of the London and County Bank it is affirmed that no loss whatever has been sustained. 3Wr. Sadleir was chairman of that coinpany, but obtained no advances from it except upon sufficient securities. Many reports having been in eirculation to a contrary effect, it is understood that, in order to remove all doubt on the subject,the three new directors, Messrs. Nicol, Hoghton, and Laning, who were last week added to the board, have required that the securities in question should be examined and reported on by some independent solicitor, assisted by the solicitors of the bank, and that a resolution to that effect was passed this afternoon. The validity of the deeds held by the company from Mr. Sadleir is stated to have been fully tested by-registration. In relation to theTipperaryJoint-stock Bank, itappearsthat this establishment was promoted by Mr. Sadleir in 1838, its head officebeingat Clonmel, with eight branches in the district. Althongh it paid dividends at the rate of 6 percent. it seemsto havemnadeno return of the numober of its'partners, the amount of its shares, or its paid-iiPe apital, and, with the exception of one or two fanuliss the shareholders are said to be persons of limited means. The families in question are alleged to be fully able to meet the claims that Will fall upon them, but it is probable that the ruin or distress which will nevertheless be inflicted in this quarter was among the chief causes of the- pain anad sef-reproach described in Mr. Sadleir'sletters. The most serious features of fraud remain still to be ad- verted to-namely, those committed by means of his opportunities as agent for the landed estates ox noblemen and others, and also by dbect forgeries of titledeeds. The trust property made away with is supposed to be extremely large, and many deplor-- able circumstance ase likely to, atise in tlis part of the history, the full scope of which wi probably never come before the publi. Ai t present many of the sufferers are themselves igorant of the position in which they stand, na most likely several months must elapse befcre all the actual facts can be unravelled. As respects the forgeries of titledeeds from the Enoltumbered Estates Court, it is satisfac. tory to be. able to state that only two cases have thus far be:en discovered, although very general inquiries ha've been made by some leading solicitors in IDublin.; In one of these, so far from the forgery, having been perfectly executed, thfe attempt is describ;'d to have been such as could not for a moment deco.ve the eye of any Irish solicitor conversatt wizh the practico of the Court, since it waa deSfient in no less;than four requisites, one of tthem -being a cer£ificate of the Commis,ionon for pay- ment of the purchase money. Theo other cm was a conveyance of part of the Portarlington eMtate, which was probably in better form. Beyond theea cases it is questioned if any wi be found. M1 y of the deeds assigned by Ir. Sadleir passed through the hands of Messrs. allowes and 11amilton, of DubTlin, and the London clients of these gentlemen liav 'to-4y been informed thatz in none of theme instances does any iiTeg.ulaityaexist. e - 'TJo prospectus -has been-issued of- another.jointstock banl; to be called the West Metropolitan, with a capital of 300,0001., in 1001. shares.

ZONDO2, WEDZNESDAY, PEEBR-RYZ27, 186. -; Lords lat night, ZLLoR. rose to cal the attenton ie second report of the Comnisto inquire into the Mercantile Kind dom and moved the first oilla on the siject, with the underthey should be referred to a Seleot Cexam-LoR, and the bills were then read a first time. A disussion then arose upon the ticket-of-leave system, in the course of which Lord HAnROWBr sYid that, natuitaly, if no transportation were allowed, criminals, after a certain term of imprisonment, must be .tvrned loose on Eociety. This declaration exeited great a7la in the mind of Iord Marirsun;, who understood Lord HssR1owfBY to say that it w as imposible to return to transportation, and that the country must be given over to the present intolerable ticket-of-leave systemn. After some explanation from the Duke of ARGYLL the matter dropped, and their Lordahips adjourned. XIn the House of Commons, in reply to a question put by Mr. EWART, Lord-PAYEsrox said, the endeavours of H:R MAJEsTY's Government had been directed for some years past, and very recently most urgently, to induce the-Turkish Government to construct a serviceable road from Trebizonde to Erzeroum. The report of the Committee of Ways and Means was brought up and agreed to. On the order for remuming the debate upon the second reading of the Local Dues on. Shipping, &c., mi, LordPAxRsroy said, he was anxious to state to the House the course which HTn MA-jsr,es Go-verument, on full consideration, haddeemedit their duty to take with regard to this measure. They had felt that these burdens upon the shipping and industry ofthe country were matters which deserved the interference of Parliament, and, with the view of liberating those interest3 from such burdens under which it was not fitting that they should labour, this measure had been proposed to Parliament. In the discussion upon the bill, nothing, he observed, had been said by its opponents to shake the confidence of the Government in the justice and policy of the course they had pursued. But in that discussion it became manifest that, in the case of some of the towns affected by the bill, there were circumstances of far greater complication than the G:overnment were at first led to suppose, and which could be very imperfectly and inconveniently dealt with in a committee of the whole -House, so as to arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to the Government or just to -the parties concerned. The bi consisted of two parts,-one relating to the passing tolls and the other to the differential and town dues. iith reference to the last, it was evident that a great variety of representations was entitled to be made by the towns, and these special cases it would be difficullt to deal with in a committee on the bill. Considerable difference of opinion prevailed on the subject of these dues, and the Government had come to the conclusion that it would be more consistent with public convenience, and more likely to lead to a clearunderstandingr and a satisfactory arrangement of the complicated details relating to the differential and town dues, to refer that portion of the measure to the consideration of a select committee. The Gxovernment, therefore, thought that the course most respectful to the House was to. withdraw the bill, for the purpose of taking the whole matter into consideration, and,while the complicated detailswere referred to a select committee, seeing whether the other simpler matters might not be made the subject of a separate bilL He proposed, therefore, to withdlaw the present bilL M;lr. DIsBrA said, he had heard the propsition of Lord PrjzmRsroN; with satisfaction. When he had considered the alarming character of the bill, supported by a speech more calculated than any speech he had ever listened to ij that house to disturb and alarm the public mind, and to unsettle all confidence in prescription, he had felt it to be his duty, the previous evening, to impress upon the House the expediency of coming to a quick decision upon the question. The noble lord, he observed, had spoken of the consideration bestowed upon the subject; but lhe (Ar. DISRAB) wished toknow what part of it could have received any consideration bythe Government. TheHousewas now told that a select committee wsas to investigate the subject; but if it bad already been thoroughly investigated by the Government, where was the necessity of a select committee? What was the use of a Cabinet and of a responsible Ministz:, if they could bring forward crude measures, then. recoil from them, andx devolve their duty upon a select committee? MAr.. DISsuAu concluded with some caustic remarks upon the general conduct of the Government businmess this session in that and the other House of Parliament, which had witnessed, he said, the defeat and discomfiture of Ministers by their own followers. Mr. LABouenmxn animadverted upon the tone adopted by Mr. DmsmA, which he contrasted with the temperate spirit in wbich the debate of the preceding day had been conducted. He defended the course taken by the Government with reference to this bill, wihich, having been founded upon. the report of a commission, was not o pen, he said, to the reproach of crudeness, and he thoulght, when the circumstances of the case were duly considered, the song of triumph which Mr. Disr had thought proper to sing upon that occasion would ho moderated. After a few remarks from Mr. aEAnDLAh and Er. HADFrmu,, the order was discharged, and the bill was withdrawn. The Charitable Uses Bill was read a third time and passed, after a short discussion of the amendments proposed. The Select Committee on the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, and that on St. James's Park, were nominated, not without some opposition. Some- further business was disposed of, and the House adjourned at five mainutes after ' o'clock.
When the Mlunicipal Corporation Reform Bill wa& brought into the House of Commons it was urgently and indignantly demanded that every corporation in the kingdom should be heard at the bar of the House in defence of its rights and existence. Nso doubt, had that been done, some oversights might have been avoided, some better arrangements devised for the property and trusts of the corporations, better boundaries hit on, and various supplementary and amending acts rendered unnecessary. Bat then, on the other hand, it is just as possiblethat the bill might never have been passed at nll, that the controversy would have gone on from that day to this, continually aggrvated and embittered, -and collecting, year by year, the prolific elements of local animosity. At this distance of time, and with ahundred or two reformed corporations the creations of Parliament, not only going on quietly and respectably, but fancying themrselves prescriptive, and giving themselves all the airs of the most venerable antiquity, we might almost wonder to hear, or even remember, that there had been such a quarrel, and that it ended in the destruction of so many old charters, and the triumphant creation of so many upstart dynasties. But why. need we now wonder at anything of the sort? We have only to look at the debate of MIonday night, and the result in our columns today. NTo doubt, changes of any importance are not to be done in a day. They must have an accumulated and explosive force to overcome the resistance they will always have to encounter. For ten longyears the proposition to carry our fifty thouisand annual corses decently away from the thick of this metropolis was baffled by the combination of the thousand and one interests that it happened to interfere with. The bishop, archdeacon, rector, clerk, beadle, sexton, undertaker, publichouse interests, were too many for it. It was surprising how many people were found to have a vested interest not onlyin mortality, but in the disregard of decency and health. That is precisely the sort of opposition that the Lcal Dues on Shipping Bill would have had to encounter. Where the opponents are legion, even though that legion be not of the noblest order, it is better to fight it out,.if possible, out of doors, or upstairs, or anywhere else than where one has to be every day of one's life. Government, therefore, last night exercised withdrawing its bill and re- best Parliamentary veitilation for the Report of the Royal Comuission. Of course, a Parliamentary Committee will have greater authority, and even larger opportunities, than: a Royal Commision. It will have more credit for fairness, andu will at least go more into detaiL The House of Commons has on more than one occasion shown that it wodd rather a taing were ill-done by itself than well done by a Government Board, and, if the former is more acquiesced in than the latter, at least one object of legislation.is attained. But neither a Royal nor a Parliamentary Committee in these days is likely to come to any other decision on the principle of the measure before us than that already come to. There ewDsts not the power in this land which wil venture to decide that any portion of lHun MAJMrvs subjects may ax. any other portion for their own peculiar benefit. Though it may not be always possible to carry out with theoretical completeness the principle of no taxationwithoutrepresentation, we have at least come to this-that there shall be none without consideration. Whoever pays and whoever takes the toll, it shall be spent for the good of the payer; and Parliament will take care that it is so spent. In the present instance it appears that Parliament, by one of those oversights unavoidable in large and summary legislation, in transferring the collection of certain duties from one body to another, has neglected to transfer the trust with the duties. In fact, the Municipal Corporation Reform Act did accomplish a piece of skoliation as far as concerns the shipowners and importers paying duty to the port of LiverpooL The original duties were for the improvement of the port, and Parliament unadvisedly took them from the improvement of the port, and, in effect, from the shipowners and importers, and appropriated them to the particular conveniences of the ratepayera of Liverpool. This was robbery; and -to make amends for it and rectify that oversight was one object of the bill just withdrawn. The Corporation of Liverpool has indeed taken an effectual way to realize for its own local uses a revenue which it could not but suspect to be a questionable property. Every lawyer knows that the holder of property under a questionable will or other weak title is much more apt to spend it, or encumber it with mortgages, than if his title were less exceptionable. The Corporation of Liverpool, it is now loudly proclaimed by its representatives, has mortgaged the duties in question as far as they will bear. This certainly complicates the question, but it does not tell much in favour of those who have so lavished the funds of which they were only trustees. The Corporation of Liverpool may plead, if they like, that they cannot refund what they have spent; but they will hardly make a lavish anticipation of trust nwney in their hands a reason for leaving it always at their disposal. This part of their defence, then, is rather a damaging one, as respects the principle of the measure, though, of course, it interposes a difficulty, and therefore delay. The opponents of the bill have taken the usual care to mix up the question of principle with all the difficulties in detail; and in a measure affecting a great number of ports, all enjoying their own customs and laws, they have been able to make a great show of objections. But, after all, the rule is a very simple one. Daties colected from shipping and imports must, and for the future will be spent, for the benefit of the shipowner and importer. They will not be made the private 'property of this ot that body of men. As it is too evident from the experience of the past that they are not safe in the present hands, it is time that they should be collected and spent by the servants of a Governmnent responsible to the whole of the empire. A port necessarily belongs, not to the community gathered about it, but to the empire. .The duties it levies are 'upon goods in transitte. They are paid, in effect, by thepublic at large. It is, then, an imperial question, and the British people have a right to demand that no local authorities shall blockade the ports and entrances of this realm, and exact a blackmail for their own special uses. Nothing can be clearer or stronger than the case of the public. If, as in some instances, town dules have been spent for naval purposes, or it may not be easy to distinguish at once between the general and the local application, such questions may well be referred to a Select Committee. We hope that Select Committee will make no worse discoveries than confusion of ideas, not between ieusm and tzulm, but between local and general pumposes. Meanwhile, the report of the Conmission on which the late measure was founded, and of which it was, in fact, the inevitable result, will obtain more attention than it would otherwise have done, and its recommendations, we have no doubt, be better appreciated.
Sir GORGoE GRzy, in his character of Home Secretary, has just given us the assurance that nothing is intended but fair play by the appointment of the Select Committee to inquire into the best means of opening St. James's Park to the public. Lord PABRsToN, as Premier, has ratified this assurance. Sir BENJN , as Chief AEdile of the Ministry, adds, that not only was it never intended to exclude public traffic fromi that portion of the Park which lies in front of Buckingham Palace, but that at the time the clamour was at the highest against the apparent selfishness of the policy pursued he was actually engaged in the preparation of a plan for admitting the traffic over this very ground. Marvellous indeed are the ways of statesmen, and of all who dabble in Statecraft. The great art seems to be, that a proficient in this noble science should -carefully hide that which he ought to reveal, and disclose that which he should conceal. There was no question here of foreign diplomacy, no Treasury secret, no suggestion which might inot with the! utmost propriety have been discussed by every cabman in London, and this was just the occasion selected by Sir B. HTAL for dealing in mysterics. He must have been well aware that a perfect storm of execration was gathering round the department over which he presides-nay, that the unpopularity of his supposed measures extended even to the Court of his Royal Mistress; -yet still he maintained his dignified reserve. Even when -C My dear SBsmr' was set up as a correspon- dent to " My dear Sir BENJAaux,"-just like the:$ timely cmifladnte in an old French tragedy,-not a syllable of the dread secret was allowed to ooze. out. Sir BmrxAwiw explained that he was the victim of circumstances; that true it was he was preparing a plan upon the line indicated by his abominable posts, but that he was acting strictly under orders. The blame lay not with him, but with the Home Secretary. Now, upon the supposition that Sir B. HALL was at the moment engaged,-equally, of course,- by the orders of- the Hoome Secretary-in the preparation of another plan such as was pre-eminently calculated to give satisfaction to the pubEc, was it quite fair to Sir GEORGE GREY to hold him up to universal criticism, of a not very flattering character, as the complaisant agent of the Court? Kay, we will venture somewhat further than this, and ask, was it loyal to his Royal Histress that Sir BxaJAmN Hlnl should have left her subjects for so many months 'under the erroneous belief that she was opposed to a measure no necesary to the convenience andoomfort when om wora from him could have set the rlnour at rest for ever? This :may be Statecraft after the good old school of King JANxss I., of wise memory, but it is scarce fitted to the plain dealing and publicity of modern times. - After all, this rUOur arose not without sufficient cause. Sir BEiNJAruN did not shink from giving us material guarantees of the policy he intended to pursue. He commanded his agents to erect a line of landmarks which should indicate the precis; spot at which he intended to bisect the Park. But, as it appears, each of these posts, like the " tall bully" of the famous distich, ' lifted its head and lied." They were only so many beacons established by the Board of Works to warn intruders off. Wherever else the gardens were to be cut up, that line at least was sacred. Sir BENAAM HiALL, indeed, was all the while busy 'with his plan for conducting the traffic under the walls of Buckingham Palace; which was just all that was wished. Do the readers of THEODORf :&oox remember that pleasant scene in which the practical joker outwits the retired merchant at Twickenham I This practical joker-the Sir BExrisAm of the taleis represented as floating down the Thames in a wherry with his companion. They are weary and hot, hungry and thirsty, and they have not wherewithal to satisfy their hunger or quench their thirst. In this uncomfortable position of affairs: they perceive an Alderman and his family enjoying their claret and fruit in a cool dining-room at the end of a beautiful lawn. The question for the two tired boatmen is, how they can obtain an invitation to join the party? The practical joker leaps out of the wherry, strikes first the boathook and then the - two oars into the grotind-just lik-e Sir I BErj"ua HAAL1's posts,-±and then he and his companion go through the farce of taking a survey as for an intended railroad, which is to be driven through the Alderman's grounds, and to shave off the pet corner of his conservatory. The two pseudo-surveyors, of course, soon find themselves at the hospitable board imbibing claret and peeling peaches. Now, this is just such a trick as Sir BmNzIT%nz has been playing the Londoners, always on the supposition that the real idea throughout has been to open a road in front of Buckingham Palace to the public. We trust the result may prove that it has been so, and that the right hon. joker has been mystifying the town for his own private amusement, or from some of those abstruse motives which regulate the conduct and inspire the action of such statesmen. There is no very serious objection to the names selected for the committee upon Sir BPssu&nr's plans. There is one thing, however, which we would strongly impress upon their minds. If their object be to meet the wishes of the public, the public, desire no expensive improve3nents or costly undertakings. We dou't want a viaduct across the gardens-we don1v want a tunnel under the Duke of Yorm-we simply want that the circuit of the Park shall be open to the public, as Birdcage-walk is at the present moment, with access at Spring-gardens, St. James's Palace, and Buckingham and Storey's gates. The displacement of a few iron gratings, the widening of the passage at Spring-gardens; and the opening of a road across the upper portion of the Parade, would give us all we ask. Don't let the committee be too magnificent.
If the railways have lengthened our lives by shortening distances, they have also done so by diminishing the dangers of travelling. We are every now and then, it is true, startled from our sense of security by the report of some appalling accident, and very much remains to be done towards the prevention of these calamitous events; yet, in spite of their still too frequent recurrence, it is every year becoming more and more evident that the train is not only the cheapest, quickest, and easiest mode of conveyance, but also the safest. In instituting a comparison between the risks of travelling by the old and by the new method we have certainly no statistics of coaching days that may help us; but when it is announced that according to the last returns the proportion of persons kIled to the number of passengers conveyed was one in 5,000,000, and the proportion of persons injured to the number of passengers conveyed was one in 460,000, the number of deaths at least is so infintesimaal that the superior safety of the railroad will probably be admitted. One iu 5,000,000 !-it seems almost incredible, almost inappreciable; and, if the proportion of injuries is considerably greater, still it is wonderfully small if we compare it with the expectations that were formned many years ago of the dangers of railway travelling. Sneaking roughly, it may be said that for every person who is killed by railway accidents ten are injured, so that during the period when one in 5,000,000 was kdlled one in 500,000 was injured. It may well be doubted whether in the days of the whip and reins anything approaching to such a result could be elicited. When the night mail went " smash" aggainst the milestone and pitched all the outside passengers over the hedge and all the inside passengers into each other-when the four bays, under the handling of some young scapegrace, dashed away with the " Defiance," knocked over a postchaise in passing, andacame to grief as they flew sharp round the corner into some ponderous waggon-there was no Board of Trade to register the lost lives and broken bones; and still less was any account taken of those private conveyances, the greater numnber of which have been rendered unnecessary by the ubiquity of railways-the gig that conveyed the "respectable" man -to market, -the light cart, and the heavy family coach, the successful management of which depended so much on the caprices of the driver and his horses, each of which had his own private ends. We are ziot yet able to slide on sunbeams and voyage in a " wishing carpet," but we are in a fair way to do so. If, however, there is ground for congratulation as to the advances that have been made in the mode of conveyance, the report which has just been issued by the Board of Trade in reference to the railway accidents of last year contains also some facts that may diminish our satisfaction, and some recommendations that areworthy of most serious attention. WVhen it is stated that by the last returns only one in 5,000,000 passengers appears to have been killed, it must be remembered that this is an average of all the railways together; that the fatal accidents on some railways are infinitely less, and those on others infinitely more. Why should not-the companies under whose management the greatest mortality has occurred be as successful as those under whose direction there has been the least T There is a very remarkable fact exhibited in these tables; perhaps it is, of all others, the most important lesson which they convey,-namely, tJhe enormous difference between the accidents in the first and in the last half of each year. Ia the former they are comparatively rare, as wil be seen from the return which we have quoted, which belongs to the first six months of last year, the deaths having blen still more rare in the same Jperiod of the previous year-only one in 7,000,000. But it so happens that in the ivst six months of each year the number -of passengers is inereased by about one-fourth. What is the con"-uence? The fatal accidents are increaed not at the aame rate-not at thle rate of 25' per cent., but at the rate of 80 per cent.; they are very nearly doubled. In the earlier, half of last year the deaths were 10; in the later half i8; and that is the average for the last six years. The significanco of such a fact is- very evident. The numberP passengers is increased, the number of trains is increased, but the agements of the different railway companies are not calculated to meet all the additional travelling and extra work. The number of travellers in the early part of 1855 was 51,000,000; the fatal accidents we have already said were at ,the rate of one in 5,00D,000. Compare this with the numbers traveDllng in the latter half of any year, and the difference is enormous. The nearest number we can fmd is 50,000,000, which represents the passengers in the latter part of 1852. The fatal accidents in that period were 21, or one in 2,375,000. The difference is accounted for by the fact that the passengers in these months were 11,000,000 more than in the previous halfyear, and the directors did not increase their establishments in the proper proportion. The whole number of deaths in the present year has been 246, the passengers kIlled being 28, servants of the conmpanies and savvies 125, and persons neither servants nor passengers 93. The proportion of these to the whole number engaged-the travellers, the servants, the trespassers, and the general public going over the level crossings, it is impossible to calculate. The report of Captain GALroN gives very minute information as to al the accidents that have occurred, their extent and their orignm, how far they might have been prevented, and how farthey proceeded from causes beyond mortal controL In very few cases are the accidents really accidents. For the most part, they proceed from defects inthe permanent way or in the roling stock; from insufficiency of accommodation, or of appliances for securing safety, such as a means of communication between the guard and engine-driver; from the insufficiency of the staff; from the negligence of servants, or the defective system of working generally. The worst of it is,-and we must call especial attention to this part of Captain GAnTox's report, as the most important lesson which it conveys,-that many of these accidents have beenthe result of defects which had been pointed out to the companies again and again, which had previoisly been the cause of disasters, but which the companies refused or delayed to remedy. How is it thst the railway companies are not subject to control in this matter? The officer of Engineers who is sent to report on a railway accident goes only upon sufferance; the company might refuse all information,-they might even deny him admission; and, however imminent the danger of any imperfect work,-however evident the madness of any arrangement,-he has no power to order this or that to be done for the safety of the pubEc. Our whole railway legislation is absurdly defective, but on this point most of all. It will, perhaps, be said that the fear of damages wil protect the public from the negligence or incapacity of directors; but practically it is found that this is not a sufficient safegard, although, no doubt, it has its advantages. On the other hand, by the appointment of an inspector, it may be said that the responsibility of managers would simply be diminished, without really being shifted to any one else. But it is Xa monstrous absurdity, as Captain GATTos says, " after an Cacicdent has pointed out the existence of danger "in the works or in the management, that for "mere convenience of traffic, or to save a trifling " expense, a railway company should neglect to "apply proper remedies." We may add, that iI the officer who is sent down with much pomp by the Board of Trade to visit the scene of a disaster, and to institute an inquiry into its cause, is only empoweredl to " re- "port," he had better stay at home. His presence and the official air given to his- examination convey an idea that, whatever was wrong will be set right, whatever was deficient will be supplied, and the public travel in fuller confidence even than before, though the very same cause which has produced one disaster may be left unabated to insure another, in spite of all the inspector may have said, or may " report to his department.
A strange suit, worthy to be ranked among the caUses cb;res of Doctors' Commons, was heard and determined in the Prerogative Court on Saturday last, An aged and infirm Mady, the widovw of a Major in the army, died at Brighton in the month of January, 1850, at the advanced age of 82 years, leaving behind her an only son, a Captain in the Royal Artillery, and having down to the time of her death passed as a widow under the name of Mrs. MIajor CAnxBEaL. The lady was a strict Roman, Catholic, was attended on her deathbed by her Father Confessor, who administered the last sacraments to her as mrs. CA3RBEIJ, and afterwards performed tasses for the repose of her soul under that name. The son was present at her death, and followed her to her grave, and the inscription on her coflin represented her as the relict of Major Canmrmm. It seems that by her father's will her son was entitled to a considerable property upon her death, suibject, however, to the life interest of her husband, if she left any husband surviving her. She had also personal property of large amount, to which her son would be entitled if she died a Vwidovr and without a will, but otherwise her husbana would claim it as his exclusive property in case of her intestacy. After the funeral her son and the friends of the family assembled to hear her wiU read, when the person who was supposed to be her executor stepped forward, announced himself as her hliband, and, -as such, asserted his claim to her papers and property, to -the exclusion of the son. The friends repudiatea the claim; but no wiU could be found, and a suit for the administration of her property ensued in the Prerogative Court, in which the son was enabled to put the asserted husband on the proof of his marriage. The case of the asserted husband was, that six months before the death of this aged lady he had taLen her in a hired carriage to the office of the SuperintendingRegistrar of the MIarylebone district, and in the presence of two witnesses, selected by him., strangers to the deceased, had contracted a mnarriage with her according to the act of Parliament, which was purposely kept secret for fear of her son's anger. One of these witnesses was- produced, and swore that he was not a stranger to her, .but knewv the lady, and the signature annexed to the entry in the book of the registrar was sworn to be in her handwriting. It appeared fiuther that her age, her residence, and the name of her father were wrongly entered, butt the act of Parliament does not pelrmit a false entry to invalidate the marriage. It was in vain for counsel to contend that the marriage in;itself ifas grossly improbable, that the parties i.ever cohabited, never acknowledged each otlher as husband. and wife; on the contrary, that the lady always treated the asserted husband as a guest at her house, to the last moment retained thename of CAPTBELz, and never could have deliberately intended to disinherit her only son, in whose arms sae died, as it was proved that she expressed her warmest gratitude to a faithful servant who had summoned her son to her bedside to attend her last moments, and a host of witnesses spoLe of her as doating upon her son to the last. Thhe asserted husband produced himself as a witness in his own cause cunder the new law of evidenee, and swore solemnly that he wus honestly carrying out the deliberate wishes of the mother in endeavouring to deprive the son of his inherit3nce. 'The Court felt bound to pronunce thyt the f Jct of a mariage solemnized -according to the Rct of Parliament was proved, and that Such a mariage was attended with nil the consequences of a marriage publicly celebrated ain facie eccdsai, and acmnowledged by the parties during their lifetime. The son left the court stripped of his inheritance, saddled with his own heavy expenses, and with part of the costs of hip adversary. It may fairly be a question whether such a state of our marriage law is satisfactory, and whether it is not a scandal to a civilized country that the institution of marriage, which was intended for the protection of the offspring of the wife, should be capable of being perverted to its ruin.
Sir JTOMf PAxneTO2 last night gave notice of a very sensible proposition, which he intends to submizit to the Hoiise in case ?Ir. RoEBucK brings on the motion of which he has given notice. It is with referenco to the appointment of the new Coimission of Inquiry into the Proceedings of the Commissioners of Crimean Inquiry. Sir JoHr PAxrKGrOx thinks-and most people wil think with himthat if the Scm=Axy OF WAn had submitted the reports of the Crimean Commissioners to the Costx&z--rn-1N-CmEr before he presented them to Parliament, he might have avoided tome portion of the scandal which has just fallen on the shoulders of the military authorities. At least there would have teen unity of action. As to the Commisiou itself, we mean no slight or disparagement to the galant officers who are appointed to this thanidess and uneasy office -when we warn them that, whatever their decision m3ay be, it will remain without value for Parliameent and their felow-subjectz. Everybody knows that they are merely employed to get the Horse Guards out of a very untoward scrape. It is an insult to the common sense of the nation that a close Commission should be summoned to sit in judgment upon tho proceedings of Commissioners who acted in the light of day. This is the practice, without the wisdom, of the worst days of the Venetian Oligarehy.

FUNERAL OF THE LATE DUE OF NOR?POLRW. The remains of thLir noblema wvee consigned to the family vault of the Howarcls, in the private chapel attached to the parish church of Aruncd , yesterday morning. The funeral was of a simple character, the mourners following the corpse on foot from tho castle to the church ; but the presence of a large body of the tenantry, coul ed with the members of the corporation, and indeed the wehole population of the borough, combined to give the ceremonia an imposing effect. The body was removed on Monday ight into the crypt of the castle, wvhere it remained until 1 o'clock yesterday morning at whichhour the burial had been appomtedto take olace. The coRn, beingvery massive, was placed upon a plams funereal car, drawa by two black horses richly caparioned. The procession was headed bythe members of the7late Duke's houtsehold walking, twro and two. After them came the pursuivants and officers of the Herald's College, viz,. t Rouge Croix I. R.

SECOND EDITION. .THE T13IES OFFCE, WeQdndiay MiW. EXPRESS PROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre*ondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.:- I sent last night by telegraph a short memsage, of wrhich T trust no accident or design has retarded the -rivaI, announcing the important fact of the gigning of the 'xmiatice, and which mny previous letters wil have led you to expect. Tne Moniteur of this morning confirms the fact in the following Words:- " The irst nmeeting of the Congress tDok place this day at the Hotel of the 31inister for Foreign Affairs, at 1 o'clock. The siting lated till balf.past 4 o'clock. It was agreed that an :rnistice, which -wi of right expire on the 31st of hlarch next, shall be concluded betreen the belligerent anmies, This armistice shall be without effect on the blockades established or to be establshed" The additional official information in the preceding, of hardly less interest, you have, I trust, aso received by this. The Mloniikcr wll no doubt be as sparing as possible in the communications it makes to the public of the progress of the Conferences; but I learn that besides the above the Austrian propositions were paraphed bythe Plenipotentiaries as preliminaries of peace, establishing their identity. Count Walewski, as President, opened the proceedings witlh a brief speech, explanatory of the important business b,efore the Congress, and no doubt containing the usnal good wishes for success. The sitting lasted but three hodrs and a-half, and as we presume that a sincere desire of peace animates all parties, it is probable thaI al umnecessary and tedious etiquette was dispensed with, on the occasion; that _spaceof time was not too much for the exchange of powers of the Plenipotentiaries, the opening address of the President, the reading and affixing the tie waiefll; to the preliminaries of peace, and the discussion as to the arnistice. It appears, moreover, that a declaration in writing was signed by the Plenipotentiaries not to reveal directly or indirectly what passes at the Conferences until the whole shall be concluded. This last is the only point lo which a journalist may object, but there is no help for it, and any protest he might make wonld very probably be considered as non *areiw. With this exception aU the rest appears satisfactory, and you wiU appreciate the importance of the armistice expiring on the 31st of Mtarch next, when the operations may be resumed wvithout the necessity of any new order being given, and also its being limited in its effect to operations by land. 1 communicated yesterday the fact of the Russians continuing to fortify themselves in the Gulf of Finland. This fact has been confrmed to me in an*other quarter since I despatched my intelligence; and though the enemy only imitate us in con-Iinuing the construction of their defences, yet it shows that they are not yet so completely exhausted as is supposed, in one direction at least. The Plenipotentiaries have taken their places at the Congress table in alphabetical order, as was at first stated. The usual rule admits, it appears, of two forms of proceeding: one alphabetically, as 'relates to the countries represented, the other according to the order the Plenipotentiaxies are officially presented to the Sovereign. I mentioned on Sunday week last, that though Baron Brunow had arrived in Paris first, yet that Lord Clarendon was presented at the Tuileries before him; and I have reason to know that this precedence was nob the result of chance but of design. Before the presentation took place I was informed that suclh uwould be the case, and that it was in order to show that France and England remained as before the most prominent and most united in their alliance. The Joatima- dei D8bats states that the latter form wvas followed yesterday; that the places to the righc of the President of the Congress were occupied-first by Lord Clarendon, then by Count Buol, then by Count Cavour, and then by Connt OrlIfi', and Aali Pasha; that in the same order on the left wvere Lord Cowley, Baron H:ubner, the M1arquis de Villa Marina, Baron Brunow, and the resident Turkish Ambassador, Mehemed Bey. This is not correct. The places follow each other in alphabetical order, thus-Austria, France, Great Britain, Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey. It vas rnmoa-ed this morning-and the rumour may be repeated-that nothing like serious discussion took place at this first sitting, everything having been previously known and probably agreed on, and that conversation rather than discussion took place. I am informed that the contrary is the fact, and the various points which wvere to be brought before the Plenipotentiaries at the first meeting were in reality seriously discussed, and that it was only after such discussion that the armistlee was signed. I mentioned in a previous letter that the armistice would follow Without delay the signing of the preliminaries. Indeed, I am informed that in the cer-tainty of no difference arising on this point the order for a suspension of hostilities was sent to the .Crimea a day or two before the opening of ?the Conferences. As yet everything looks well, though I have- no douibt that some difficilt matters will have to bc discussed. By the Russians themselves it is -affirmed tihat the Czar is disposed to make any concessioina demanded of him, short of what is " too humiliatng." A good deal depends, of course, on what they consider to be " too humiliating." On Russian anthority, too, it is stated that Austria will hardly support any proposition that has for its object the demolition of the arsenals of Nicholaief, or the closing up of the Bug, because such a measure would completely annihilate Russian trade in those parts. I cannot vouch for The exactness of that statement. -The Congress did not meet to-day. The severe labours of the Plenipotentiaries vere relieved last night by a concert given at the Ministry, and a dinner, to which all the Ilenipotentiaries and the resident Ministers of the Governments they represent, as well as other distinguished persons, were invited. In the evening the magnificent saloons of the hotel of the !,Iinistk-- for Foreign Affairs were thrown open, and from 600 to 800 of the elite of what Parisian society is now, filled them, and the nolble room in which the 12 diplomatists accredited to the Congress meet, namely the Salon des Ambaszadeumi, *:as thrown freely open like the rest. it is sepa.rated from the Minister's cabinet by another fine room, called the Salon des Attach6s de Service. The Salon dles Ambassadeurs receives its light from three large windows opening on the north, and lookingtoi-ards the Seine. Oppositethe windows are hung two fine full-length portraits of the Emperor and Empress. The curtains and furniture of the room are of crimson satin, with a rich Aubusson carpet on the floor, and the ceiling richy painted. The tabIe at which the diplomatists sit is circular, and covered with a greneloth, twelve armchairs being around it. Between the windlowvs are tables, one for the two gentlemen who are to act a; secretaries, and the other for the use of any of the Plenipotentiaries who may wish to write in private. The table of the secretaries can be moved close to the round table in the centre if necessary. It -was lhardly expedted that this mysterious apartment where matters of such moment are discussed, and on which such profound secrecy is obsersced ; it, even to their nearest and dearest, the Plenipc. -te*i3aies nust not breathe a word, should be al- ocl to be trod by the steps of the uninitiated. It is aicult to give an accurate notion of the cure.- 1siW,f those who thronged to that interesting spot, and who earnestly explored every part, glanced over and under the table, gazed en the blank sheets of paper lying on it, touched the pens which had a few short hours before been handled by the hands of thoie who are dt,gidin- the questions involving the peace of the world, in hopes of guessing at what had passed around the tapis vert. Where were no'w the table-turners, to evole some spirit who might be cajoled or intimidated to reveal those secrets? Many a glance was cast at the figures of the clock on the maantel-pieco to discover the impression made on them by what they had been eye and ear witnesses of. All in vain, the figures made a sign it is true, but spoke not, and though it was evident they knew ahlabout it, as they looked yrovokingly knowingand smiling, they still maintained their bronze taciturnity. At the banquet Count Walewski proposed a toast to the success of the Conferences, and to which I presume all present heartily responded. Afterwards the concert took place, to which, as I have already said, the principal personages of the highest society in Paris were invited. Count and Countess Walewski received their gnests, as they always do, with that urbanity of manner which makes each guest thinik that the fete was for hin alone. In this brilliant assemblage the Plenipotentiaries were the greatest objects of curiosity, and among these was unquestionably Count Orloff. Count Orloff is said to be 70 years old. It may be, but he certainly loolks 15 years younger. He is what may be- called a portly-looking person, of a military aspect, and, whether from associations connected with his name or not, people remarked something like an expression of sternness on his countenance. He conversed with several persons, and his deportment was extremely quiet, and his whole manner one of repose. HIe was in a plain evening dress, and wore two stars composed of brilliants on his left breast, with a broad blue riband en 'charpe. There was no Court dress, nor indeed any sort of uniform, and even Marshal Magnan and General Canrobert were habited en bourgeois. Anli Pasha, the OttomanPlenipotentiary, was also an object of some curiosity. He has the reputation, a well-established one I believe, of much intelligence, and of cultivated mind; but there is nothing remarkable in his exterior. Prince Napoleon arrived at about half-past 10 o'clock, also in non-military costume. He, as well as the Gencrals who have been lately decorated by Queen Victoria, wore the insignia of the Bath. The company was composed of about 700 persons. It would be difficult to describe the tefect of these gorgeous saloons, which are perhaps the finest of their extent to be seen anywhere. In one of the most spacious were the artistes who were to delight the assemblage with the " concord of sweet sounds." In this room the great majority were ladies, and in the adjoining ones, which opened into it, the men collected in groups to listen to the soft strains of Mario, Borghi MIanco, Graziani, and Frezzolini. Choice passages from the favourite operas were performed with great effect, and M3ario was greatly applauded in a sweet song, the "I.Ange sip7tr," from Fa0orita. JUefreshments were abundantly-served in the large banquetting room, and every one appeared contented and even happy. The company began to retire about midnight, and there were few who did not vwish that every sitting of the Congress, and particularly the last, may terminate as harmoniously. In the Inden,emidanec Belge of Sunday we read that the direction of that journal has been resigned by M. Perrot in favour of M. Berardi, who has assisted him in the editorship for the last 10 years. However, a different construction is placed upon this transaction by the En2uniwipation, which publishes the act of sale of the Iid4epnda2zce, executed at Cologne on the 18th of February, by which that property has passed into the hands of M1essrs. A. and S. Oppenheim, bankers of Cologne, G. Mevissen .and Co., of the Schaffhausen Bank in Cologne, andthe proprietorsofthe Cologn,e Gazette,&c. The price paid was 800,000f. For the purchase and conducting of the paper a company in shares has been formed by MIM. Berardi, Veron, Phillips, Oppenheim, MIevissen, D6lcbmann, Wendelstndt, Joest, and Du Mlont. By the statutes3L Berardi has been named girant, and MI. Jules Lecomte representative of the journal at Paris. The orfnitenr publishes the returns of the principal merchandise imported into France in January last, and the Customs duties levied thereon, which amounted to 11,105,208f. Compared with the receipts of the corresponding month of 1855 there is a falling off in 1856 of 1,396,786f. The salt tax produced in January, 1856, 2,442,164f. or 384,407f. more than last year.

(-.ONe our, Ows- RORnuPOXDNr.) MARSEILLES, FEB. 25. Travellers arriving by the mail packets from Constantinople complain that they are seriously inconvenienced by the number of invalid soldiers embarked on board those ships. First-class passengers pay a high price, and consequently expect suitable accommodation; on the contrary, the vessel is crowded with soldiersdischarged from the various hospitals in the Crimea or at Constantinople. The odour created is most offensive, and typhus fever has frequently broken out on the passage. When the passengers arrive at Marseilles they expect to be released from their sufferings, but here again they are disappointed. If one suspicious case ofcontagious disease appears on board, the mail packet after landing the mails is ordered off to the Frioul, a quarantine ground 'at the opposite side of- the bay.- The sick are landed at the Lazaretto; there the ship is fumigated, returns to Marseilles with a certificate from the officer of the Board of Health at the Frioul, receives pnafipte, and finally lands her unfortunate passengers. A remarkable instance of the delay and inconvenience to which passengers are subjected occurred on Saturday last. The Tliabor arrived at Marseilles at 1 p.m., with the mails from Constantinople of the 14th inst., and those of the Crimea of the 12th. She brought 154 passengers. The Thabor experienced on Friday night a tremendous gale from the north-west, with a heavy sea. The mail passengers expected to land on their arrival in port, but unfortunately one case of fever declared itself on thepassage. The Thabor was consequently ordered .to the Frioul, to land the one invalid. She proceeded there, landed the sick mnan, was fumigated and returned to Marseilles, where she received pratiree at 7 p.m. Noby who witnemed the ravage caused in Marilles by cholera during the Lat two sum1tDs 4C - liae the QffSiers of health for taking every pteeaution to prevent tlto spread of typhus fever, which in this country is regarded as a modification of the plague, but the great error appears to be the conversion of mD1il packets into hospital ships. It is further complained that the military passengers are embarked Xn the packets -without any' medical attendant, and the ontire responsibility and care of the invalids are cast on the physician of the ship, whose atten. tion is consequently diverted from its legitimata object-attendance on the ordinary passengers and crew. A few weeks since 180 soldiers, dischargel from the hospital at Constantinople, were embarked on a mail steam-packet bound to Marseilles; they were not accompaniei by any medical officer, nor was any statement of their maladies given to the physician of the packet, so that he was forced to make his report to the Sanitary Board at M1arseilles as best he could. An English steamer towing an American clipper arrived this morning from the Crimea with troops on board, and have been ordered to theFrioul, where they still remain.1In these cases the ordinary passengers have no reason to complain. The ships are transports hired for the conveyance cf troops. * There are but few transports freighted by the French Government at present in the port of the Joliette. They arethe British steamer City of Manche3ter, laden with provisions for the army in the Crimea and now ready for sea, the Athenian, the English clipper Ssiftsire, the Sardinian steamer Italia, the American clippers Great Republic, Albion, Tempest, Willianl Dixie, and tJhe Lady Suffolk. There are likewise two very handsome English yachts in the New Port-the Talisman belonging to Mr. Denison, and the Selina, Mr. Bailey. A letter from Toulon of this morning states that the steam frigate Christophe Colomb' had sailed for the Crimea. The -tug-boat Vigilant had brought into Toulon an English merchant steamer, which .showed signals of distress two leagtues off the coast. AUSTRIA. (FROM OUn OWN CORRESPONDrNT.) VIENNA, FEB. 2.3. The information contained in my last three letters relative to the intentions of the German Confederation in the Eastern question is fully confirmed. The first four points have not only been adopted, but will be maintained by the Bund. The fifth point, which was brought forward separately, has also been adopted, but with such a reservation that, de facto, the first four guarantees form for Prussia and the German Powers the basis of the negotiations for peace. The question of the representation of the Bund at the Paris Conferences was not brougl:t forward at the sitting held by the Diet on Thursday, the 21st. The mise en, scene of the little drama just acted at Frankfort was not bad; but stillU ninety-nine politicians out of every hundred will feel inclined to suspect that the wholething was a concerted game. Shoulld Turkey and England desire to give the necessary development to the 5th point, Austria will now be able to remind them, that if their demands on Russia are too high, they will lose the sympathy and valuable support of the great German Confederation. - You were vesterday told that Turkey intended to claim an indemnification for her expenses during the war, and information has since reached me that she will demand the sum paid to Russia when peace was conclucded between the two countries in 1829. What that sunm was you will find in the subjoined extract, which forms part of the eighth article of the Treaty of Adrianople -- "It is arranged and settled that, as a reparation ' for these damages and losses,' the Ottoman Porte shall within the period of eight months, and on terms to be afterwards fixed, pay to the Imperial Court of Russia the sum of 1,500,OOD Datch ducats. And the payment of such sum shall put an end to all the reclamations or reciprocal claims which have been made by the two contracting Powers." In the treaty it is explained that the Russian trade suffered " damages and losses," and even His Mlajesty, theKing of Prussia, must fain confess that Turkey has suffered some little pecuniary loss in consequence of the brutal and unprovoked attack made upon her by his late Imperial brother-in-law. As the representatives of the Powers are just about to decide on the all-important question of peace aud war, there could not be a more fitting moment for communicating some information respecting Russia that is contained in an interesting, but marvellously ill-arranged article, which has just proceeded from the pen of Baron von Reden, a well-known writer on statistics and political economy. The7Imperial domains of Russia are about three' times and a half as large as the Empire of France, and their population consists of 8,825,958 males and 9,312,326 females. It has been' calculated that on an average 502 persons inhabit an area of five English square miles. The services rendered to the State by the 18,138,284 " domain peasants" during the year 1853 were as follows Of the 8,825,958 males about 1,000,000 may be fit to render military service, but as the "conscription" fin 1853 extended but to 5,500,000 of males, only 55,263 soldiers were actually raised. If 10 able-bodied men were taken from every 1,000 " souls" throughout the whole of the European part of the Russian Empire, there ought to be about 150,000 recruits; but M. von Reden very justly remarks that the result of a general conscription is never what it appears to be on paper. In 1853 the gross revenue from the State domains was 48,694,069 silver roubles. The number of domain or Crown peasants was 20,252,000 in 1843, but M. von Reden has omitted to tell us why the population had within 10 years (between 1843 and 1853) decreased to 18,138,284 souls. Several attempts have been made to blast the rocks in the bed of the Dannbe, at the so-called " Iron Gate," but there isreason to fearthatthe operations of the engineers have not been attended with any great success. Major Derwent, of the Engineers, has been sent to examine the Sulina mouth of the Danube, and he is believed to have received orders to draw up a plan for the removal of the sand. The navigationof theUpperDanubehasundergone agreat' improvement, for in future the Bavarian steamers will transport goods direct to Vienna:and Pesth, and the vessels of the Austrian Steam Company will take wares onto Passau, Ratisbon, &c. In short, there will be no relading, as has hitherto been the case. There is to be a railroad congress hero next week, to which the Minister of Finances has invited the representatives of the various foreign' companies which have expressed a desire to invest their capital in Austrian, AustroItalian, and Hungarian railways. The Credit Bank will naturally also be represented, as Baron Bruck never neglects any opportunity of giving to that highly favoiured establishinent a chance of employing its capitalto advantagge. The Credit Bank has-taken shares in the Empress Elizabeth or Vienna-Salzburg Railway' to the amount of 20,000,000 fi, but the Adminitrative Council has resolved not to distribute more than 6,000,000 fi. among the holders of the Credit Bank shares. The pro. portion will be one railroad share to 10 Credit Bank shares, but'such a high value is already attached to the former that the latter have within the last 24 hours risen some 12 per cent. The remaining Vienna-Salzburgh Railroad shares, to the amount of 14,000,0009 will for the moment remain in the coffers of the redit Bank. It is related that a Syndicate is to be formed by the grantees of the Vienna-Salzburg railroad and the Credit Bank, whose duty it wil be to see that the market is nob glutted with the shares. Soon after the Credit '3Bsnk, c menced its operxUPns the founders sold I almost all their shares with a profit of 12 rand 15 per cent.; but many of them have been glad to ppy a pronium of 50- per cent. in order to get them back Again. It is thought that Baron Bruck would do well to endeavour to check rather than to encourage the spirit d speculation which now prevails, or rather rages, for i the Peace Conferences should prove a failure there woum1 be a regultr fnancial c.isis here. The Italian nobles and merlhantsi who are proverbially thrifty, have offered to inyest 22,500,000 of lire (the lira is 8d. English) in thG Italian railroads. It is not my custom to enter iito detail on financial matters, but it appeared necessary to call your attention to the fact that foreign capital to an enormous amount is Timding its way into this country. - TTnfortunately the desire to obtain a share in the projected enterprie is so great that some of our own countrymen have displayed a spirit totally unworthy of British merchants. Reports have been purposely spread injurious to the credit of houses of high repute, in order that Government should not enter into connexion with them, but this hint will probably prove sufficient, and therefore no names wi now be mentioned. A Cabinet messenger is expected this evening -with despatches from Count Buol. A series of dinners has been given to Prince Gortschakoff and Colonel Manteuffel by Field-MIarshal Prince Windischgratz, Count Lerchenfeld, the Bavarian Minister, and Baron Eonneritz, the Saxon Minister, who all belong to the Russian party. According to a Constantinople despatch of the 14th the question of the future position and organization of the Danubian Principalities was discussed during the last conference which was held befor.s Aali Pasha left for Paris. Prince Callimachi will soon leave for Vienna. M. de Thouvendl, the French Minister, has recovered from his indisposition. We learn from Milan that the Anglo-Italian Legion is complete. The shares of the Vienna-Linz Railroad Company have not yet been issued, but they are already at 26 per cent. premium. iLECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (FRO5 OUst OWN CORRESPONDENT.)

I FOBBIWN INTBLLIGNCE. FRANCE. (FROM oM OwN CO-R1-rnT nvxC I IA porMion of the following appeared in our second edIltion o yesterdaY:-1 PARIS, MONDAY, F4m25, 6 P.3. The Dibats and -the Constitutionnel contimue their biographical notices of the Plenipotentiaries who by their presence have inaugurated this day the Congress of Paris. The D6bats thus describes Al. WValewski and M1. de Bourqueney:- "Count Colonna Walewski has been engaged throughout the quarrel which produced the war, either as Ambassador of France in London or as Minister of Foreign Affairs in Paris; he has followed all its stages, is acquainted with all its incidents and details, and will not be embarrassed in directing and summing up the deliberations, and in specifying the points on which the deliberations are to turn. M. Walewsld has qualities which render him particularly well formed to act as president of an assembly composed of a few distingLiished men. He is a distinguished man of the world, gifted with the most conciliatory disposition and with amiable and courteous manners. It is not to be feared that under his presidency the discussions will exceed the limits permitted by legitimate ardour and patriotic zeal. Although still young, Count Walowski is already an old diplomatist. Twenty-five years ago he represented in Paris and London the provi-sional Government of Poland, then in insurrection against !the domination of the Russians; in 1840 he accomplished . a mission to Miehemet Ali, confided to him by 31. Thiers ; .later 3L Guizot despatched him tothe province of La Plata; in 1849 he was Minister Plenipotentiary of France to the Court of Tuscany; the following year he occupied the same position at Naples, where he remained til 1852, when he was nominated Ambassador to the Court of the Queen of England. The origin of Count Colonna Wa lewski is most illustrious, and this is always'an advantage in a diplomatic assembly. He proceeds, from a branch of the Italian family Colonna, which has given a Pope and many cardinals to the church, many celebrated generals and diplomatists to the Courts of Rome, France, and Spain. A Colonna was in 1507 Grand Constable to King Ferdinmnd the Catholic. " Like Count Walewski, Baron de Bourqueney assisted at the birth of the present confict, amd since 1853 he has discharged at Vienna the functions of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the F>rench Government. Inthis capacity he took part in the Vienna Conference, and his remarks possessed an authority which none offered to contest, because theywerefoundedonthemosthonourableconvictions and on a profound knowledge of the Ottoman empire. 31L de Bourqueney was First Secretary to the French Embassy in London in 1840, when was signed the famous treaty of the 15th of July, which seemed to indicate a fresh coalition of Europe against France. He was Charg6 d'Xffaires during the long and difficult negotiations which prepared the treaty of the 13th of July, 184L In the course of this negotiation 3M. de Bourqueney seconded with great skill the policy of France, then directed by M. Guizot. He was recompensed by his nomination to the functions of linister to Constantinople, where Louis Philippe subsequently ap. pointed him Ambassador. 31 de Bourqueneyis one of the veterans of the French 'diplomatic corps; notwithstanding several interruntions, he reckons 30 years' service. This diplomatist is of the small number of those who have conserved the grand and noble traditions of the old French school founded by Henri IV. and Louis XIV., by Richelien and Mazarin. Everybody will recollect that "the Jouaoal des D6boas had the honour of counting 31 de Bourqueney among its contributors." The DZbafs next describes the diplomatic services rendered by Lords Clarendon and Cowley, from which we extract the following "George Villiers, Earl of Clarendon, Secretary of State since the 8th of Febraary, 1853,. is, withoul dispute, the most distinguished representative that Grnat Britain could have despatched to Paris in the present circumstances. IHe belongs to the old Whig party, whose opinions ho professes with moderation.I He occupied with distinction for several years the place of British Minister to the Coart of Madrid, and was subsequently ap. pointed lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. He is perfectly well acquainted with the general politics of Europe and of his owin country. He ignores nothing that could tend to develope the greatness and the prosperity of England, and he will neglect no means to favour that development. Lord Clarendon is a highminded man, and he occupiesarmong the statesmen of England one of the first places. . . . Lord Cowley has represented the British Government in Paris since 1852. He enjoys alsothe advantage of having seenthe Eastern question develope itself, and is acquainted with all its bearings. Lord Cowley stains with honourone of the most respected names of England, and he enjoys in this country great personal influence." The PIenipotentiaries of Sardinia mre thus described " Before beeoming Minister, Count Cavour was regarded in Turin as a disffnguished economist. As Minister he i eomprehendd aft ence the necessity of creting a good g fillXl AdmWillton. He undertook himself the di&t tion of the finineeg, and only en rare occasions occupied provisionally the functions of Foreign Minister. It was in tne of th6latter.moments that he signed the treaty of alliance betfisin Fnice and England and Sardinia. . The Marquis Pes de VillAmarina, Envoy of Sardinia to Paris, was naturally appointed to assist IL de Cavour !n the representation of his country in the conferences of Paris. The Marquis served as colonel under Charles Alberb, was then appointed by that Monarch his Charg6 d'Affaires at Florence, and tovzrds the end of 1852 he was appointed to the position which he now occupies." The D-bats expresses itself unable to offer any Partioulars with respect to the Turkish diplomatists. ' Grand Vizier, Aali Pasha, is, however, very favoumObly known in the Goverrunent eircles of Constantinople, where, bis enlightened views havei brought himn into prominence. The Cen.sti.#,utioszlel offera some additional details respecting the careers of Count Walewski and 3M de lBourqueney: "Count Walewlkiwas born on the 4th of May, 1810, in the castle of Walewice. He received his education in Geneva, and returned to Poland in 1824. Three years later he desired to visit France, but was refused permnssion bythe GrandlukeConstantine. He succeeded, however, in escaping to Paris, where he w-s present during the July revolution. At that period he received a delicatexnission from General Sebastiani to the Polish Government. Having accomplished that mission, he served as aide-de-camp to the PoEish generalissimo, and earned the military cross of Poland at the battle of Grochow. After the fall of Warsaw Count Walewsld became natuailized in France, and was appointed Captain in the Foreign Legion; he afterwards entered the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and then the 4th Hussar Subsequently ho became proprietor of the .3essagcr des C7ainbres, under the auspices of MIL Thiers and Pemusat, and he also published several pamphlets, in one of whiich he ad. vocated the English alliance. . . .fL do Bourqueney ws educated in Paris at the Lycee Bonaparte. He made his d4but in diplomacy as attach6 to the French Legation in the United States, and subsequentlv he was despatched to London, where he served as third secretary to IL de ChAteaubriand, then Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. In 1824, IL de Bourqueney gave up, of his own accord, his position as secretary to the Embassy in Switzerland, and took part in the struggles of the press. The contributions of IL de Bourqueney to the Jouranl da Dibats lasted for several years, and that diplomatist is one of the few statesmen -who, having risen throughithe press, do not affect to deny or depreciate the instrument of their elevation." The beneficial effects of the resolution of the Bank of France to discount commercial biUs at 90 days are already beginning to be felt in Paris. The retail trade, however, has not yet recovered any very great activity, but the shopkeepers nrc fast proparing for spring, anld, in anticipation of peace, laying in a larger and more varied stock than usual. Nlumerous French and foreign commiission agents have arrived, and given important orders to Parisian manufacturers, who are now busily ntvork. The Russian merchants, on the other hand, have not awaited the conclusion of peace to renew their former relations with Frencl houses, but their demands are merely conditional, and to be executed only in the event of the re-establishment of peace. The accounts from the industrial disticts are most satisfactory. At Rouen buyers are very numerous, and goods are now disposed of by the manufacturers at remunerative prices. At MIulhouso transactions are likewise very brisk. Wool maintains a high price, which is likely to increase stil more, in consequence of the scanty supply of the manufacture. The sale of raw silk is very active in the Drome and Ardeche. The decline which lately manifested itself in the price of corn has been once more checked in Paris, owing to a slight rise in the provincial markets. Business, however, has been extremely limited. The best sorts of flour sold at from 9Gf. to 96f. per sack of 157 kilogrammes, but good ordinary flour could be had at 92f. 6Oc. and 93f. The reserve on Saturday amounted to 35,354 metrical quintals. On that day prices became rather heavy on receipt of a telegraphic despatch from Chartres, where wheat had fallen 1L per hectolitre. In Brittany the dechne in the price of cattle continues, and the advices from most of the markets indicate a downward tendency. The wine merchants at Bercy still keep up their prices, but it is -very probable that they.vrill soon be obliged to make concessions, as rates are looking down and. sales becoming di9ficult in the vine districts. Brandy has fallen:in Paris from 165f. to 15Sf. per hectolitre, and spirits extracted from beet from 103f. to 9E;£ RUSSIA. (FROM1 O0n BERnnN CORRESPONDE-r) BERLIN, Fm. 24. One of the most satisfactory features. of the Russian press during the last few days, or, to speak more correctly, the press of the last dates that have come to hand, is the circumstance that in a number of official documents that have been published of late with reference to the navy the Black Sea and the Sea of Azoff are no longer mentioned. This looks as if the Government recognized the destruction of the Black Sea fleet, nd the dispersion of the small remnant of its crews still extant, as a fait accompli, on which the Conferences in Paris are about to impress the stamp of permanence. In the draught of the budget for this year, for instance, there is mention made of only 53 auditors at different ports, and they are all exclusively in the Baltic, the White Sea5 the Caspian Sea, and the Estern Ocean; the two seas in the south are left unprovided for. An ukase orda-ms that the surplus of the dues paid by merchant vessels in the barbom' of Archangel shall be applied to the further fortification of the banks of the Severnaia Dwina. The marine school for the orphans of officers of the late Black Sea fleet, which at the time of the Emperor's recent visit to Nicholaieff was projected for establishment there, is now to be transferred to Relsingfors, and only one department is to be retained'there for the instruction of pilots or masters of merchantmena. lNothing transpires as to whether the building of the screw ship of theline Witiasat iicholnieffisto be stopped or continued; nor has any edict or official instruction appeared to countermand the calling out of the Marine Guard, that was to be concentrated in St. Petersburg, Cronstadt, Swveaborg, and Revel about the end of March. The official jour-nal of Finland states that the exportation of meat, fresh, salted, or smoked, over the European frontier of the empire is prohibited by land and water till further orders. . In the columns of the Wojenny Listo` (lfilitw-y Journal) are to befound official data as to thestrength of the late Black Sea Fleet, which, as being official, will have a certain historical interest of authenticity. According to these the Russian Pontus Fleet consisted of 4 ships of the line of 110 to 120 guns; 12 ships of the line of 80 to 100; and, finnfly, 2 reserve liners, of 80 guns; altogether 18 ships of the line, carrying 1,028 guns. Of frigates there were 12 of 52 to 56 guns, together with about 40 sailing vessels of 10 guns each, and 15 war steamers. The total force of the Russian war fleet in the Black Sea consisted thus of 85 vessels of all rates, mounting 2,800 guns. The entire commercial fleet that Russia possessed in the Black Sea- has been destroyed, with the exception of 11 vessels still lying at Odessa, some 20 odd at Nicholnieff and Cherson, and 20 odd that have taken refuge up the Don. The craft destroyed in the Sea of Azoffare stated to have amounted to several hundreds. The Last reports sent in by Price labanoff Rostowski from Genitchi'state that the fortifications erected foi the security of the place itself and of the bridge are now complete, andthat an energetic resistance can be. offered to any attack that may be made on that point. The Emperor has ordered that the two Grand Dukes, Nicholas andX Michael, shall at once enter upon their res?ective functions, the former as Inspector of Engmneers, the latter as MIaster of the Gidnance. GeneralDb, of the Engincers, and General Korff, of the Artillery, have been associated wlith the two Grand Dukes in these offices under the title i of Assistants. It will be the duty of the latter-1, to be present when the different chefs of the staff and directors report to the Grand Dilces on the matters concerming their branches' of the service; 2, they are to express themselves as to the best methods of overcoming any difficulties that may arise in the service; and, 3, in the case of absence or indisposition of the Grand Dukes they are to act as their deputies. In a word 4 the two Generals are to have alI the trouble and the respnsibility of the offices, and the two Gran& ulukes the credit of managing the- departments.the titunr head; of which they will be.'

(FROM OUR owViq COBBESPONDExT.) TURIN, Fm. 22. :No additional facts have transired with'regard to the expected political amnesty in omberdy, ex-. cept that the admninistrators of the sequestrated properties have been ordered to give in their accounts as soon as possible, and that the AusAtian Charg6 d'Affaires here has received instructions from his Government to communicate to owners of seques- trated properties residing in this country the terms'on which their estates will be restored to them.n Now, it isvery desirable to drawyour attention, and that of such of y6urreaders-as take an interest in the affairs of Italy (whether. for the sakie of Italians themselves, or merely as an item in the general'account of European pacification), to the- fact, that the Austrian (Government has so contrived this concession to the well-known wishes of France andEngland that, while professing immense anxiety for the restoration ofa good understanding, it posi-. tively heaps insult upon inrury on its only rival in Italy-Sardinia, and thereby adds another element of discord between those kinodoms. In esamininge this amneso it will be observed thet there aro Go very imeportant points to be noticediThe firstregards the violation of international rights t.hich vas committed by sequestrating the estates of Lombards who had previously become Sardinian subjects, and been leanly released from all allegi- ance to the Emperor of Austria; the second, the ' conditions towhichthose persons are now obliyed to submit in order to obtain restitution of th-eir property. It is evident that the present act of -the Austrian Governmentsis no reparation tor its vio- lation of national rights, and more particularly of. of the VirtarCe of the treaty of October1S, 1851, between Austria and -APiedmont. hat treaty explicitly declared that the subjects of each of the two contracting Powers should have the liberty of disposing of propertyswhich they might possess or: acquire in the territories of the other. on the same terms as the subjects of that State, and now the Auostrian Governuent requires that all persons whose property has been tequeptrated, and, consequently, Sardinian subjects amongr others, shouldaddress themselves to the Austrian authorities for permission to return to Lombardy, and to have their property relieved from sequestration; besides w;hich, it reserves toitself the rightf of imposing conditions on these Sardinian subjects, and even of maksing exceptions. Strip this decision of the Vienna Cabinet of the bureaucratic phrase; ology with whiich it is accustomed to ornarent the most unjust measures, and all- this is reduced, im-- fortunately, to a fresh proof of an intention to peroist. inethe system pursued since 1853. In fact, thinI amnesty isa astmc as to lsay, "aIdont reco anze the authority of the Sardinian Governmuent overpersons to whom the Austrian Government has granted the patent of emaigration, and who have become Sardinian subjects I consider them st-ill as dependents of Austria, and I wish to oblige theinto render an account of their conduct towards her." This, to say the least of it, is a strange pretension for anylPower to advaence at thepresentmoment, violating, as it does, all international rights towvards Sardinia and berore the rest of E3urope, ior the persons so coerced ovwae no more allegiance to Austris than they do to France or England But wnith regard to those emigrants who have remained Austrian subjects the amnesty has a cbrtain value ; that they should be requlired to demand permission to~ return is natural enough,. but it. is difficult to conciave on what grounds Austria supports herself in imposing an obligation on those who have obtained legal permission to emigrate and boecome subjects of another State to give up the protection of the Government they have chosen. For the rest, when we seete conditions exacted are either to retuin to Lombardy or have their property sold, or'be considered dead before the law, we can hardly think. the term " amnesty" is rightly applied to such an act. Recent letters from Rome say a very bad feeling existed between the Papal Dragooons and the Swviss reg'iment in garrison there, and that it had become necessary to have patrols from both corps constantcly on the alert to prevent disorders. * ~~SPAIN.

' MAI)R, BR1 20. the publie bidding for the construction of the railway from Va31adolid to turgos, which foris the second or middle section of the intended north line from Iadtid to Lun, took place at 1ep.ml to-day, in the great hall of the Ministry of PabElc Voria. This section w as put up first, becaulse the plaiis for it are completerd It was an interesting scene, and the hall was filled to overfocing. The Government had ofdered a subvention amounting to 1,300,000 reals per league, and the bidding wias in dioinutiom of that subvention-is. e., the parties who would undethake it mith the lowest amount of subvention would have the contract. Senor lujan, whdinister oE Public Works, presided, and Senor nontesinot, Director-General, and num erous other officials were present, and also many deputies. *Three sealed offers -were sent in, and successively opaned and read. The representatives of the provincial deputations of ealladolid and Burgos simply accepted theC overnment offer, and their prouoseton consequentlyamounted to this-that theywioisld undertake to make the inme for a subvention of 1,300,000 reals per league. MIessrs. Tapia, Bayo, and Co., in representation, as it was understood, bf the new Spanish Credit Company, sent in an offer to make theline witha subvention of 1,10y,00 rear ls pereleague; and,lastly,o essrs.eO'Shea and Osmabardn. the Credit Mobilier Company presented an ofFer to make the same line wiith a subvention of only 500,400 reals per league. None of theotliers offered to improve on this, and the construction of the line was. awarded in due form to the Crelit Mobilier amiid the applauses of the assemblage. Thle Minister, Senor Lujan, left imumediately to comnunicate the intelligence to the Dukre de la. 'Victoria. Itwas telegaraphed to the provinces interested mnthe line.

THE UNITED STATES. (nzov ouz ow,% VOERRMPO1D-Mx", NEW YORK, -F 12. the new eanhip Persia arived lJt wSafmday snerunig after the unusually long passage of 14 dayi. She reprts great fields of ice, in which she raslocked for tw-o days, and comes into port bearing deided marls of the hard usage she has met with. The Pacific. .hich sailed three days before her, nos not yet arrived, and it is supposed that she fell iito the same misUortune with the Persia, without the good luck which attended that vessel. Much anxiety Is felt for the fate of this noble vessel. Two xteaishipshave been despatched in searchof her, and we ae now hoping every hour to hear of her safety. The rvalry of the two lines of steamerabetween here and Liverpool has driven each to the northern pasage, because, the great circle being there, mathenatics demonstrate that it must be shorter, *ad, consequently, capable of being passed over-int less time. But the experience of tfe Persia shows that even mathematicians may be soinetimes at fault, and that it may take longer to avoid the dlagers of the shorter than to accomplisIr the distance of the longer passage. If the Pacific has met with a serious accident, the public ought to hold these companies to a strict acecountfor running into a well-known danger for the sake of muaking a quick waasage. And if the hopes of those who have friends on board are realized ad the dangers of the northern passage are surmounted, public att,ention ought to be drawn to the poibility of accident another time from the same cuses. I a;X told that the southern passage is comparaively free from ice, or at least that the danger is much leeS& The new Speaker has not yet fully completed the organization of the House by the appointtment of his oommittees. He is restrained partly by the jealousies of rival leaders of the Republicans, and partly by a difference of opinion as to policy. Some think that the Administation (who have, undoubtedly, the ablest Parliamentary leaders) should hare their share of the important posts, while others seem animated by the spirit -which Macaulay represents as inspiring the Vhi in the early years of William's reign-the pirit of retaliation and exclusion, In the Senate -the Republicanls have been excluded from every -prominent committee and from every post of winluence. The most rash of the new party wishi to retaliate in the organization of the House. The Central American. question has assumed no new phase since my last letter. The debate has -not been resumed in the Senate, nor has the House .yet taken it up. Walker is stllU there, and at the last accounts was maintaining himself, although the Government at Washington has refused to reconize his plenipotentiary. The ouse is too much occupied with the KEansas question to pay amilch attention to foreign politics. UJpto this time the difficulties with Great Britain have been a ball, -to be toe about by the Republicans for purposes -of their own, but without theassentorconnivance of the Administration. I have seen no reason to changemy views concerning the real feeling which animates the discusion of this question. It is supposed that both the Pacific and the Persia had despstches on this subject; but the former has not arived, nor have we had time to hear from Wahington about the other. The state of anarchy in Mexico is attracting -the attention of American journalists, and deserves the attention of all reflecting men. The ration, founded by the heroism of Cortes and with all the traditions of Spauish glory, is rapidly .sinking under the weight of ignorance, priestoraft, -nud anarchy, and promises soon to be blotted out from the roll of civilized nations unless some new energier can be infused into it. The last instalment on thepaymentdueunder the treaty has been at *length paid by this Government upon the drauhts of 8anta Anna. This has been done by compromnise with the Government which succeeded him. But that in turn hasyieldedtofaction, andthe succeauful chieftain, retiring from the capital, is sid to have taken with him munitions of war to maintain himsel in the provinces agsins.t the insurgents, who have made the capital too bto hold him.

The policy of adhering to renunerative rates was established in the west with the introduction of railways, and has been adhered'to; -but in the east thefeeling of rivalry and the desire to swell the gross amount of business has prevailed over common sense, until many of the road8 are ran without proper remuneration to the atocklhader An effort is now being made in New Rngland to raise all the rates. The New York roads io-uld do well to agree to follow it and to adhere to their agreement. With the great increase of population we are feeling the necessities for the breathing space. of a great city, and have just agreed to lay out a park of some 600 -or 700 acres in the acntre of the island, which is now to be adorned with walks and drives so as to make a publicgroundworthy a city so large and rich as the commiercial metropolis of America. The reason3 for the protracted contest for the Speakership are so little understood in England that I ll endeavour to state them as briefly ts posible. The passage of the Nebraska Kasas B3ill two years agO removed the restrictions by .which slavery was excluded from the national territories-that is, from the land not yet formed into States-to the north of 360 30. 'The repeal of thiu restriction, which had been regarded as one of the fundamental laws of the Union, stirred up a feeling in the Northern States which fourd vent in the organization of a sectional party, since caled Republican, and secured the returisof a majority of persons of those viewsto the preeent (-ongreas. Simultaneously, however, with this poltical movement the Know-nothgin prty sprang up-and-made itself remarkable by the .acresy and. afficiency of its orgazation and by the a-ignitude of its vote. Iu some of the Northern *4x it affiliated with the anti-slavery party; in -others, like New. York, -it stood against it. These ,hties combined carried the entire North. In the Southtthe native Americans joined themselves to those who had formerly acted with the Whig party, and succeeded in electing sveral members of Congres; but the biilk of the Southien delegation consisted of frienads of th& Adminis43tion. When the Hoiie met in Decmber last it was found. to contain a clarmajotity -of-Anti-N etbr members. 'But thi maiority could not be uniaed,n bcaus since the election, bther isues had come - up. Then ifv was .hostility to the Nebraka Bl, and a cry for its repeal. ' NoW a 3ore temperate survey had shown the impsiblity of zrepealing the act, and, instead of an ,organizaton on -a single isue, the great majority of the lNorthernl membr had fallen into -the ranlas of the RcpublEcan or NEorthern Party 105 men had taken this stand, but not a majority of the House. On the other side, the Administration could control only 74 votes In the outset these gentlemen declared their hostiity to native -Americans. The Southern- Natives,_who in the course of the struggle were called South Americans, were obliged to take a stand by thexmelves. They couldnotvotefor Banks, because he represented the principle of anti-slavery; nor for Richardson, because he represented the principle cc anti prosoription. They united themselves to certain Northern Know-nothingi , most of - whom were chosen as Anti-Nebrasla members, but who were unwiling to take the further step of llepublicanism. Thee, 'with the aid of a fewr men profe ssn sympathy with the 2epublican 'movement, but r unvilling,ness to vote for Banks, succeeded in prolonging the contet. -It 'was closed by an effectual revolution in American politics. For the first time in theh istory of the country the nationalLegislature is presided over bysagentleman selected fom sectional motives, and chowen by sectional votes. For the first time, also, since the growth of the cotton crop carried the blanters of the mouth over the rich fields of Alabama and 31ississippi and into the valleys of Texas, the sentiment of hosftilty to slavery has been powerful enongh to make itself seriously 'felt at the seat of thefederal power. The parties axenow prepaxing to cary the -'issue directly into the Presidential election of the present year. The AsZ-&~xon, a.Boston journal, publishes the follownmg statement. The facts it contains are correct, andbear directlyupon the questions now at issue between the British andiAmerican Cabinets. They constitute a portion of the British evidence to which 1 alluded in my last letter:- " What are really the twopoints at isuebetween the two Governmentsin relation to thismatter? They are these.- Was it the intention of the treaty that and should abandon Ruatan and the Bay Ilands? And, secondly, did the instrument abolish whit is called the Mosquito Protectorate? From all the documents we have read we must speak in the negative as toboth questions. That the matter of Ruatan and the claim bf Great Britai to it was fully made known to Mr. Clayton'by Sir Henwy Bnlwer, is certain, for Lord Palmerston, as early as March the 14th, 1850, instructed Sir Henry to represent to the American Government that it appeared, from a letter received from Commodore Bennett, dated January the 1st, 1850, that certain America,ns were about to establish themselves onthatisland,andtosaythatitwasa 'Britiish possession,' both dc jure and defcrto, occupied b British settlers, and governed by a British m rato. This instruction was cona- omuicated by Sir Henry Dolwer to lir. Clayton, and it becamne the subject of discussion between them, and the treaty was made in conformity to it. The treaty, as it is wel known, contains no stipulation for the abandonment of the isand, or any clause or passage that can be construed so as in any way to impair the right of England to it. Mx. Clayton, then, was ynlly aware of the claim which England maintained, and which claim she has never relinquished. " So much for the first point; now for the second-the protectorate. H Here, again, the treaty is silent as to any relinquishment of protection to the Mosqtito Indians. Eniland binds herseif, as, indeed, do both parties, that neither shall aval themselves of any I protection' to colonize or exercise any dominion over any part of Central America. Not a word is said as to any abandonment of such protection, and so fuIlly was this understood, that in 18, MIr. Webster, then Secretary of State, entered into neotiations ,with Mr. Cranipton, with a viewv of putting anend to it, which England was, and is nowv, most desirous of doing. These negotiations resulted in the formation of a convention, which was agreed to and signed by the twvo gentlemen jas mentioned, and would have gone into effect.but for the opposition offered by the Republic of Nicaagua." T'his winter is distinshed as the coldest known for many years. Since the 26th day of December we have had no break in the inclemency of the weather. In the first week in January a severe storm, reaching farinto the Southern States covered the country with snow, which has snce Lain untouched by the sun's rays, affording excellent sledging in regions where frequently the season passes with scarcely sufficient frost to brown the fields. In Washington, where sedging is a luxury that most years do not afford, the snow has been undisturbed by thaw for now four weeks. Cairo, at the month of the Ohio, where the corn is usuallyharmested by the Ist of July, is reported as covered with snow to the depth of eight or ten inches-a light covering compared with what we have in these more northern latitudes, but alnost unknown there. Even as low as Nhatchez, in the very southern regions of the MI;ssissipi, where the-warm win'dc from the gulf make spring of winter, we are told. by the telegraph that ice forums across the big river and impedes the navigation. The harbour of Niew Yorkr is filled with floating ice.
THE ROYAL MIITARY COLLEGE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Sir,-I trust that you will, in fairness, have the goodness to allow methe insertion of a few words in reply to a paragraph which appeared in your impresion of yesterday. The paragraph to which I allude states, with reference to the Royal Military College, "Colonel Prosser, the Lientenant-Governor, is absent on leave, and presumed to be too il to retorn." I beg leave to enclose a certificate from Dr. Tunstall, mny medical attendant here, which will show the real state of the case; I ask the favour of you to insert it with my letter. This if the first time, during a period of 18 yeare'service at the college, that T have been absent a single day on account of health, and I have now been on leave only 16 days. Your informant will pardon me for remonstrating with him on the indelicicy-to use no harsher tern-of thus dragging a gentleman's name before the public, to the injury of his prospects and the alarm of his relatives, on such trivial grounds and on a mere " presumaption." I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant, GEORGE W. PROSSER, ColoneL Bath, Feb. 21. "I hereby certify, that Colonel Prosser, Lieutenantt Governor of the Royal Military College, is in the enjoymen. of good general health. "He is, however, suffering from a local affection, produced bydrinking water at the Royal Military College, which 3Mr. Herapath has just proved by analysis to contain a sufficient quantity of lead to produce the symptoms under which Colonel Prosser is now suffering. "Colonel Prosser has only been under my care 15 days, and as he already shows symptoms of amendment, I have every reason to believe that hewill in the counrse of a short period be enabled to resumne his duties at the college.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

But we cannot quietly sit down and read the severe, nay, we may state, harsh, and unlust comments made by Captain Robertson, and, indeed, by Mr. Yardleyalso, upouthe conduct of Mr. Clayton, the chief officer of the Josephine Willis, without attempting to say something'on his behalf.

!HE CmiVL WAR IN? KANSAS. The Newtv York Courier and B3pirer publishes the following from a correspondentb who writes, on the 27th, from Iawrence, Kansas:- - The msow is now full 14 inches -deep, and-thethermo. rteter stands in the morning at 10 degrees below zero. For over six weeks the mercury has not, only on twro occsions, and therefore but a few hours,indicated a teniperature -above freing point. -The cabinsof the settlers, and indeed the best dwellings in this city,* are very open, and the people ate exposed to the cold winds, which must produce dises when the weather shal have moderated. The people ascribe tneir.exposures to the ' late war.' They say that the last of O3tober and the whole of November, up t. the time the war broke out, ws uiaited to outdoor labour; that good weather came on just as the war broke out and lasted two weeks, which time they would have expended in improvements; but, in consequenee of the disturbances, they were compelled-to suspend all business, and the reslt is their exposure to this chiling winter weather. - I wrote you in mny las of the renewal of the war. -Expresses are continually arriuing from different points in Mffissouri, bringing the inteligence that - the ' Border ruffians' are preparing for another attack. They have organized military companies at every place along the border in Mfissouri, and hold themselvesx in readiness to march upon usatanymoment. At Rickapoo a gang of rowdies, who iXest the Mliniouri river during the summer season, have collected, organized themuselves under the name of Kiekapoo Rangers, and hold themselves in readiness at all times to march to any point where their services may be demanded.. It is said they are 150 strong, are each mounted, and wlleJ armed. There cannot be a doubt but they are under the p3y.- of the Platte County Defensive ociation, or eome siniar organization in the slave States. Their time is wholly expendedcin drinkin, gambling, and fighting. It was these men who butchered Mr. B. P. Brown, the particulars of which I gave you in my last letter. "The persons who were with Mr. Brown the night previous to his brutal martyrdom have been compelled to flee from the neighbourhood and come to Lawrence for protection. Mr. Minard, l,Xr Sparks, his son and nephew, and several others, are nowhere. Others have fled to the Quakers Mission for protection; Thereis nosecurityforthepersons or. property of Frec State men in the vicinity of the disturb. ances nearEaston. " Our people are holding themselve in readiness for an attack at any hour, although I think there is no danger until the weather moderates, and, in fact, I shall not look for it until the 1st of March. The borderers desire to prevent the assembling of our State Legislature, apprehensive that theycan accomplish more before that body convenes than after. "The several fortifications which were hastily thrown up during the late war in this city have been mauned, and sentinels are at each, constantly on duty, keeping a There are four of these fortifications, Which are circuar in form, and areraised about five feet high, with a ditch on the outside. riethin these testorary barracks have recently been made, and here the citizen soldiery are quartereb. bort Necessity-or Fort Smith, as it is called by some-is situated near the foot of Maassachsetts-street, commands the fordingplace over the river, and is designed as a retreat for the wromen and children if the tov;n should be besieged or bombardem A high staff is planted in the centre of this fort, from which our nationsl ensign foats in the breeze " About 5D rods south of Fort Necessity, and a few rods east of Massachusetts-street, is Fort Hunt, nowf in the command of the Hon. Morris Hunt, recently elected a judge of our Sapreme Court. He has 12 mneunder his charge, each armaed with a Sharp's rifle. " Fort Hollidayis a few rods west of Massachusetts-street, and designed as a protection of the town fom cannon at Oread Mount. This is the best built fortification of the four, and probably will have to stand the principal charge when the contest is opened upon us. " Fort Dirl-ey is somewhat north of the latter fort, and is designed to protect the town against an irnvasion from the west. "A circular redoubt is thrown across Massachusettsstreet between forts Hunt and Holliday, and would be a very effective resort for the citizens with arms in case of a charge from the south. " All along Masachusetts-street, between the last-mentioned entrenchmnent and Fort Necessity, are breastworks thrown up between the houses, forming a sort of fence on either side. "T he Emigrant Aid Company's fine hotel, which is stll in an unfinished condition-though labourers are at work upon it-is also under guard constantly, and is mzade the headquarters of the generals and their staff, as well as of the Committee of Safety, Executive Committees, &C. - "Elxpresses have been sent to the different towns along the border in isssouri to purchase ammunition, and every arrival brings some.

Lane are also commissioned to visit the States, but will not leave until the present danger is passed. General Lane is needed to command the trooPs in case of an engagement. He is an intrepid and gallant officer, and deserves much for -the valuable services he rendered General Robinson during our late difficulties. Mr. Brown concedesthat he cannot be spired from his post as editor of the Herald of Freedoim while the enemy are constantly threateniag its destruction. " These gentlemen wil address the people in such places as they have been directed to do, and wi then meet at Washington and urge our claims for admission into tho Union before Congress.

PORTUGAL. TISBO3, FEB. 19. After a few days of fine weather we have had a retarn to the storms and rains, which have been so unusually preva. hat this winter,7and produced great distress. I amn sorry to report another loss upon this bar. The English schooner Howard Primrose, John Cantwell, with codfish, from St. John's, for Lisbon, was driven by the heavy west and south. west gales so far into Cascaes Bay during the night of the 15th inst., that the captain was obliged to attempt the bar in order to save the vessel from being driven on shore, and in that attempt the strong fresh water current from the Tagus iaused the vesselto drift and strike npon the sands near the Bujio lighthouse at hsalf-pa,t'3 o'clock on the mornang of the 16th. This sealed the fate of the Primrose, which soon began to brealk up, and the crew continued in great peril untif4 O'clock in the afternoon, when the captain and five men were resCued from a fragment of the wreck by the intrepidity of a boat's crew of nine Portuguese sailors, from Parvo d'Arcos, a fishing port inside the bar. One of the men had alreadY floated on shore -upon a piece of the wreck, andl thus the whole of the crew were saved. 'tho nine sailos who rescued the others had already one off to the wreck at daylight, but being unable to get alongnido they returned to Paco d Arcos for a larger boat, when their courageous efforts were crowned with sucoess, and will be rewarded by subscriptions from the English merchants of rthe port. Sovere comment has been mnade upon the fact that a Portuguese steamer of war, ordered dowAn to the bar in the morning, returned abont midday with a statement that the wvhole crewv had perished, when it appea±s they were at the same timue clinging to the vreckr, anid'actually saw the s'eamer approach, turn round, and leave them to their There is no doubt the captain of the steamer' could not distinguish the crew, and believed they had all perished -bU-xt itLis suppoed he might have made a more minute inves. tigat30n it he been provided w-ith a proper boat, and. in any case he might 'rasonably have remained longer in the neighbourhood of the disaster,- or have bien still better em. ployed in seeldng at fitboat at the neighbouring fishing port, whence the boat vhich saved the crew proceedea some haurs later, and, with: great labour and difficulty ucceeded in. saving lives which the steamer might have more eadily contributed to save. It is lamentiable to think theirare no proper lifeboats stationed near this, where wrecin so -frequently occur; but I am glad to say there is some chance that eficient arrnements wsill be made before n3ext winter.

ROGBBSS TABLE TALK.* The late 1r. Samuel Rogers occupied, without *question, a considerable space i the eyes, of. his, contemporaries. Thathe sdid so is due to avariety -of circumstances, none of them rame in themselves, bnxtinfluential in. their combination. He was an, elegant poet, and his poems were communicated to the world'with some of the' most elegant adjuncts which'taste and fancy could dcevise. He was associated by his position with the elite of the world of letters. He had a good fortune combinedwithfreedom from domestic ties, and abundant leisure; with an inclination for society. In books, in pictures, in cookery, and in wines he was esteemed a connoisseur ; -and to the attractions of his house and table he added the mutual attractiveness of guests of whom the world talked freely, but who were given to talk still more freely of each other. Samuel Rogers himself,' the centre of this microcosm, the little Miecenaa and the lesserVirgil of the same pleasant circle, was in one respect more remarkable than any of his company. lHis life was prolonged far beyond the average span, and he had been the familiar associate of two, almost of three, generations. Hewas full of gossip conceringactors who had left the scene, and he obtained increased consideration for himself by means of the tags which he was a'bletoappendtocompletedre]?utations. Hisyounrer friends looked up to him with a reverence which was not diminished bytheir dreadof his disparaging comparisons; for, in truth, he ohs evermore liberal v;ith his purse than with his praise; and he had thus the advantage of a union of quaEities not incom-patible, although opposed; he was influential alike by his hospitality and ill-nature, by the generous 'use of his wealth and the lavish abuae of his cynicism. We may thus reverse the maxim of antiquity and speak truth of the dead, for the ear is cold, and truth can wound no longer. Samuel Rogera was a partisan, but he had not the enthusiasm of a partisan; he was a friend, but he had not the cordiality of a friend. He was given to moderate detraction, and to certain acts of good-nature. He was prone equllytosmallcalumniesandtoightattach ments.He has left, we do not doubt, the recollections of many agreeable hours which his friends would desire to preserve if they were able. He was unquestionably entertaining, a devotee of society, w,ith many of the qualifications w;hich society exacts. His frienids may thereiore dzire. to record his table talk in virtue of the amusement it afforded them on the instant. But between their desire and its attainment there is a vide interval. Conversational power is a volatile essence as incapable of preservation as the fragrance of the flowers or the bouquet of the wines which stimulate and enhance it. The lustre of the finest wit is dimmed beneath the shadows of the sepulchral lamp, and can never be perfectly rekindled. The most admired conversers suffer by the attempt to make a record of their fugitive accompslihment; and it is only the brilliant m10t or the pregnant sentence which will bear the permanent test of the lItera sc,z7pt. Wit and wisdom of the highest order have, indeed, sustained thistest in some rare instances, andhave been revivified in a few books which are deservedly immortal. But the friends of Mr. Rogers should have been well advised before they put their sosveairs into competition with these. Er. Rogers had seen much, and, in the way of facts, he had remarkable things to telL As a child he had chasedbutterflies in a cocked hat. He had seen the ascent of the first English balloon and almost the first English umbrella. Hle had once seen Garrick act, andhe had once put hishand tremblingly on Dr. Johnson's knocker. He had heard Haydn play at a concert in a tiewig, with a sword at his side. He had talked to a Thames boatman who when a lad had frequently assisted his father in rowing Alexander Pope, aud who had told himthat Pope on such occasions sat in a sedan chair. He had heard from the lips of old General Oglethorpe, "then very, very old," that he had shot snipes in Conduit-street, or ratherwhere it now 'stands. He was in France before the first French Ifevolution, and had dined at Lafayette's with Rochefoucauld and Condorcet. He had dined also with Helen Maria Williams when Eosciusko was of the party, and had heard her describe hei experience of the theatres- of Paris at the time when men and women who were waiting for admission would quit their places to see if any of their friends were going by in the guillotine cart, and who, when satisfiedon this score, would return to the door of the theatre. He himself had seen a carload of giEls going to ,be~ hung for takinge part in Lord GieorgeGordon's riots. He had shaken hands with Wilkes; had heard Sir Joshua's last lecture, at which chairs were reserved labelled-" Mr. Burke, MIr. Boswell," &c.; had listened to Sir Philip Francis denouncing the' partitior; of Poland at the M-ansion-house, and derived thence an additional as-; suranco that the orator was " Junius." He had also heard Sheridan thundering against Warren 33 astings, and paying a compliment to another of his audience, "the luminous author of n7e -Declibe and Fal."He knew Joseph WVarton well; had seen Howard, the philanthropist; had heard Robertson preach in the morning, and B31air in the afternoon; had eaten strawberries with Adam Smith, had seen the, corpse of John Wesley, had been familiar with 'Miss Farren and the Duchess of Gordon, had introduced Sir Walter Scott to Madame D'Arblay, had joked with Erskine, had walked with Grattan, and talked with the orator of evoking the dead, had seen Lord Nelson spinning a teetotum with his one hand and Lady Eamilton going through her " Attitudes," and had been kissed by the latter for his interest in her Nelson relics. He had, of course, seen much of younger or subordinate celebrities, most of whom are gone, all of -whom are old, and known chiefly by their fame to this generation. He had, in fact, seen so much that he oughit to have left a remarkable testimonyr on the wbrld and its doings if he had been gifted 'with superior wnisdom or wit, and his gifts had in any sense been judiciously illustrated. The inpression to which this volume condemns us is nevertheless a simple dilemma. Either -SamuelRogers was no conjuror, or he has been made to appear such a wretched spectacle that we conceive there is a call for the literary police, after such an exhibition, to do their duty. The editor boasts that he, has inserted nothing which was likely to hurt the feelings of the living; but, if he has been equally considerate to the reputation of the dead, how completely he has evaporated a popular fame. He states that from his " first introduction to Mr. Rogers he was-in the habit of writing down in all their minutike the anecdotes, &c., with which his conversation abounded;" He did so, moreover, to the expressed satisfaction of the victim himself, who " sometimes had the mortification of fnding impatient listeners ," and of " these memoranda, which gradually accumulated to a large mass," a selection is now published. On which we observe if this bea -selection what must the residue be? We pity the task of the anonymous Boswell, but we cannot on this occasion temit a particle of his doom. - -Ile v-eivfryt page 'operis with the following important statement _-" I was taught by my mother, from my earliest infancy,, to be tenderly kind towards the meanest living thmg; and, however people may laugh, I sometimes very carefully put a stray gnat or wasp out of the wiow. Myfriend Lork Holland, though a kind-hearted man, does not mind killing flies and wasps." Then the practice of Shaq in' similar cases i recorded, and the conclusion is an observation on the sufferings of animals in this life, and a doubt whether they may not be compensated in the worlI to come.

" Very shorty before he died he tomplained of great uneasiness in his rtomach, and Cline advised him to try the effects of a cup of coffee. It as accordingly ordered, but, not being brought so soon as was expected, Ms Fox expressed some impatience; upon which Fox said, with his usual sweet smile, ' Remember. my dear, that good coffee cannot be made in a moment."' n- . * Here isa maxim of sago experience illustated by ingemous imagery :- "A man who attempts to read all the new publications must often do as the flea doe-aLijp." Here is a revelation for Rochefoucauld, for ex. ample: , "Such is the eagerness of the human mind for excitement -for an cval,-that people generally hae a sort of satisfaction, in reading the deat of their friends in the new papers. I don't mean that a mauwould not be shockod to readthero the death of his child, or of his dearest friend; but that he feels a kind of pleasure in reading that of au acquaintance, because it gives him something to talk about with everybody on whom he may have to call during the day.".- Here are two discoveries aud an obier d idtum, which follow each other, with the typographical advantage of interveniing metal rules and'very wide spaces:- " Places are given away by Government as often for the sake of slencing animosity asin the hope of assistance from the parties benefited." "The Fiench Revolution wasthe greate.t eventin Europe 8ince the irruption of the Goths." " The, most beautiful and magnificent view on the faoe of the earth is the prospect of Mont Blanc from the Jura Mountains." Here is an importa7nt literary verdict- " This is not a bad charade *-'What is it that causesa cold, cures a cold, and payathe doctorX A. draught." Here is a novel refletion on one of the inconveniences of longevity:-' "To any one who has reached a very advanecd age a wfalkthrough the streets of London is like a walk ia cemetery. How many houses do I pass, nrow inhabited li strangers, in which I used to spend such happy hours wth those who have long been dead and gone!1" Eere is a closely' discriminative criticism on Beattie's Mfin.trcl- "Iremember takingBeattic's Minst,d down from my father's shelves, on a fine snummers evening, and reading it, for the first time, 'with such delightl It still charms me (I mean the First Book; the Second Book is very inferior)." Here is a new light upon certain obscure passages of Dryden - "How naturally the words follow each other in this coupletof Dryden's in the Second Part of Absalom and "'The midwife laid her hand on his thick skull, !' With this prophetic blessing-Be thouduU I"' And in that touching one in his Epizt to Congrcuw, "'Be kind to my remains; and, 0, defend, Against your judgment, your departed fziemd!"' Here is a criticism for which the authority of Fox is timidly cited "He thought that Robertson's account of Columbus was very pleasingly written." -Here Crabbe is cited us the communicator of a g,reat secret to Sir Walter Scott:- "Crabbe used often to repeat with praise this couplet from Prior's Solomon:- "'Abra was ready ere I called her name, "'And though I caU'd another, .bra came.' It is sorcewhere cited by Sir Walter Scott; and I apprehend that Crabbe made it known to him." It is unnecessary to continue these citations of trumpery, but it may be as well to add that much of it is old trumpery. The "short and tedious" story on page 159 we have seen better told in a certain old caricature. The next storg but one respecting Gray's fire-escape, is invariably repeated, and the window pointed out by the guides who show visitors the lions of Cambridge. The stories of Monk Lewis and the Duchess of York, page 163, and of Parr's reply to Macintosh, page 48, have been longmi print. The first s,tory respecting Lord Ellenborough, page 197, has been also published. So have thor,e especting Selwyn's scentefor carion and Fox's discrirmination between the law of debt 'and the law of honour. The story of Tom Sheridan keepig Parr prisoner by fixing the weathercock due east iS localized in Oxford, where the victim of the pleasantry is said to have been the late Dr. Routh. Probably both of them are but the representatives of some earlier valetudinarian. The Englishian's and Frenchman's duel, page 212, and the Portlandplace story, page 222, are so old that they may be included in the category of " ancient Joes." It is ,quite possible that they may have been gleaned from the table talk not only of Samuel Rogers, but of Samuel Rogers's grandfather. We do not deny that the same volume contains other stories which are new and some of them good ones. One of the best is told by the Editor in a note:- "Mss Lydia White long since dead) was a lady -who delighted in ving parties to as many celebrated people as she could collect. The following instance of her readi ,ss in yeply was communicated to me by my friend, the Rev. .Eamness. ' At one of Lydia White's small and most ageeable dirnners in Park-street. the company (most of them, except the hosess, being Whigs) were discussing in ratheraquernlous strain the desperateprospects of their party. IYes,' said Sidney Smith, ' we are in a most deplorable condition; we must do something to help ourselves. I think we had better sacrifice a Tory virgin.' This was pointedly addressed to Lydia White, vho, at onco catching and applying the allusion t4 Ipbigenia, answered, ' I believe there is nothing the Whigs would not do to raise thc waind.' " Here also is a good thing from Ersldne: "When Lord Erskine heard that somebody had died worth 200,0001., he observed, ' Well, that's a very pretty 'sum to begin the next world with."' Here is an illustation by Sidney Smith I" He said that - was so fond of contradiction that he would 'throw up the window in the middle of the night and contradict the watchman who was calling the hour." Here again is evidence of Rogers's timid deference for a great man, and of the conceited ef&ontery with which the great man treated him: ," lseitherMloore nor myself had ever seen Byron when it was settled that he should dine at my house to meet Moore ; nor was he lmown by sight to Campbell, who, happening to call upon me that morning, consented to jointhe arty. I thought it best that Ialone should be in the drawmig-roDm when Byron entered it, and Moore and Campbell accordin;ly withdrew. Soon after his arrival theyreturned; and I m- troduced them to him severally, naming them as Adam named the beasts. When we sat down to dinner, I asked Byron if he would take soup? 'INo; he never took soup.' Would he take some fish? Ilo;- henever tooklf,sh' Presently I asked if he would eat some muton ? I No he never ate mutton.' I then asked if he would takea glass of nine ? I No; he never tasted wine.' It was now necessary to inquire what he did eat and drinkt and the answer wvas, 'bthing but h3rd biscuits and soda-water.' Unfortunately, neither hard biscuits nor soda-water were at hand; and he dined upon potatoes bruised down on his plate and drenchedwith vinegar. Myguests stayedtillvery late, discussing the merits of Walter Scott and Joanna Baillie. Some daysafter, meetng Hobhouse, I saidtohim, 'HEow long will lord BWr6in persevere in his present diet?9 He replied, ' Just as longas you continue to notice it.' I ~didnot tben kno;r,' what I nowknovr to be a fact, that Byron. iEter lcavingmy house, had gone to a club inSt. James's-street, and eaten a hearty meat super." Eere is: a Efftle post rortems scandl by way of revenge "As we were crossing the Apenninse he told me thathe kad left an order in his will that AUegra, the child who soon after died, his daughter by Miss C., should neverbe taught the Englsh langsge. You know that Allegra was buried at Harrow; but probablyyou have not heard that the bowas set over to EngLand in two packages, that no one might Ssusect what it was." But we s juote no further, for we will be no parteb to deluding the publc into the impression that this book deservestheirseriousattention. It is slight in appearance, slighterin reality, and the editor mnst settle his account vrith the shade of Rogrers as he may. 'If he has not done him justice, thlrfe is a case for the executors.

We believe that a much as euld be done in refereice t4o the r t desiderata is done; buft, until soeevery imnRortant atera tion is made in the phy calstructric of the interior of theg building, Newgate-must continue to-bo a standing reproach to the city of London.

It ne-ed hardly be sited that no mischief of this sort could possibly have been attempted at Holloway. Y'our special comucitteehave had aplan under consideratica by wrch it is believed that New. gate could be cured of its grt defect and the -eity relieved from the reproach of standaig almost alone in having a gaol without a system Thelan would give 120' separate oells, and we aroof opinion that if such a plamc were carred out it would enable the governor to establish A degreo of separation and supervision which would be almost, if not altogether, unohiectionahie. The cost is estimated by the City Architect at 10,ODDI. We have also given our atiention to another plan of a comprehensive ture for the entire demolition of the courts and of th_ 'ol, and the reconstuction of the courts and such a portion of the gaol as might saffce for the custody of prisoners while the trials were going on; the object of this plan being to dispense with Nergate as a prson, except only as abovo stated. A plan has also been sub. umiteed to us for such ddition to the prison at H0oloway as would enable it to receive the prisoners now keptat NewgXte. The cost of these combined operations-that is, the roconstraction of the cri.- minal courts and a portion of New"ate-is estimated by the, City-Architect at 87,0D01., from which may be deducted theValIe of a piece of land at the Old Bailey set free by the alteration of the system, which tho City Architect estinateg at 9V00O. In wvorking out these plans the City Architect has so arranged as to permit the smaller ono to form an integral part of the larger one, so that if it shoiud be ther pleasure of the Court to carry outthe recommnendation of the committee in Adopting the first-named plan, and it should hereafterbecdeeme expedient to carryouthe largerone, no material alteration would be necessary, .nd but littli loss would accrue. That portion of the reference which relates to the expenses of the gaol, and alsoaas to what steps it may be expedient to adopt with regard to the officers, their salaries and duties, cannot vell be dealt with until the question as to thealteration of the gaol is determined. The questionas to the expediency and legality of abolishing the - prison altogether having been considered,jt does not seem to be expedient, and the legality, therefore, hardly seemed to be an object to-be asertained, and that has therefore not been made a matter of inquiry." The repot of the sub-committee was signed-W iia Cubitt, . T. Copeland, T. Q. Finais, Bi. lastleyKennedy. The report of the committee recommending it to the adop. tion of the Court aas signed by 10 aldermen. Sir P.

He did not object to the report, but it -would be satisfactory to get the unanimous assent and concurrence of the whole Court, in3tec& of the simple report of a committee, hovrever numerous it might be. (Hear, hear.) Alderman Cuarm= aid, the report- had not been hatily' concocted, nor had any name been attached to it by any member of the Court who hadnot gonefully andthoroughly into the subject. last year circoumsances had arisen which brought the state of Xewgate more prominentlybefore the GaolCommittee. Thegovernor,from age and infirmity. resigned, and a new governor was appointed, when it became absolutely necessary to revise the system of discipline and management in order that that offical might have tfull and proper instructions for the neceRSa.-y conduct of thegaoL. It was then founmd to be utterlv imnossible to get a satisfactory system of supervisRion sinless great alterations w.ere made in the structural part of the prison. ' (Hear, hear.) He (Aldermn Cubitt) moved-" That the report be received, and that it be referred back to the com. inittee to act therein as they shal think fit" Alderman Fn%rs said, he seconded the motion because he was satisfied that, inlaying out 10,OD00., that sum would not be lost, but would ultimately lead to a condiderable saving. A few days ago 13 female prisoners were confinedl in Newgate, and, on account of the defective structural arrangements, it was necessary to burn 19 fires for the purpose of taking care of them. (Hear, hear.) Alderman SmSXy said, he very much reioiced to think that the report had at length come to the Oonrt for consideration. e agreed with the former part of the report, which condemned the gaol of Nesato as being altonether irremediable, and which was probably at that moment the worst disciplined gaol in the kiugdom. They haduendsr their jurisdiction one of the best disciplined as well Ps one of the worst disciplined gaols in the country. They, hald a prison at Holloway which admitted of theeasest possible extension, and where the same disci. pline which was adopted there could be carried oult; and they had Newgate, with all its sinnosities, the prisoners' actually looking after the keeper, instead of the keeper lookng after the prisoners. To his7 (Alderman Sidnev's) knowledge, during the last fewyears several prosecutions had' been abandoned, and the sumnmary juisdiction of nagi-. trates asked for rather than3 that persons shouidmbenputto iha iconvenience and ainoyance of miping with the a ersons holoitered shout the Central rimtinal Court. p eifacIt there wasR no proper accommodation for either prosecutors orwitnelses. (llear,ihear.) lderman Sidney then went into avaraety of details, showing that thatthe costofgthe supporow of prisoners in Ncwgate was double the amount of the tapen. diture at Holloway.

Aeferman Co to r said that the sante altogether of anew.t gate was of a most uonsatisfactory character, and that a complete alteration oughttobemadein it, both nith rspect to casification of prisoners and structural arrangeements Alderman Srnnv then proposed the fol.lowing amendment - "Theat a deputation of the Court be appointed to confer with the Secretary of State for the Home Department with reference to the projected alterations in lNewgate, and to report thereon to thi Court; sand to learn from that ?dlais. ter whether there is any obJection to the plan of removing the prison to Hollowy." A=dennan CAP.TRn seconded the amendment, which Ws put and negatived. The original motion' was then put and carried, and the Court adjourned.

VICE,CHANCELTORS M OOtTS- Fnt 9 lV. ELKIYV V_ 1IflR'T (Before YicecChiancldor Sir R. T. KLk iSLEY.) This was a petition ureeented bs the Countess of 3ornin-g len, asiug for the diiarge of the receiver of thetates .ppomnted under an order obtained by LordWellesley in Ml such receiver being appointed upon the ground that the Earl of M10iington was grossly mismanaging the tates, and that the trustee, upon being urged to act, dedared themselvesauable to do ao, being stopped by a notice from the earl. Mr. Wright, one of the trustees, was a k.krupt, andBr. Greeny, a clergyman residing at Salisbury, of advanced age. The Court made a decree in 1849, whereby a charge upon the estates in favour of dy Mfornlngtonof 1,5OC a-year wa established. A suit of "-Mfornigton v. Greenly" was then instituted for the a pointment ew trustees, on the- ground of the t-on oft e t- ts, and on the.llth of June, 1855k his Honour appointed the oum. Colonel Howard and 3r. Haruxge trustees. The pre.-Sent petition,inwhich the Earl of bornington concurred, -was presented on.these grounds -.-That the trustees could :iot manage the estates or take posgetion while the receiver was still scting ;-that uch recesver was personaly obnoxious to the earl; and that the receiver and Lord Wellesley were, In fact, acting in concert, and the mode in 'biheh the estates were managed had the effect of improving the interest of those in remainder at the expense of the income. No fear reed exist of any interf&-enee on the part of the earl, inasnuc.h as he was still under an injunction granted by the LasterofthelBo7usinanother-suitof"W elesleyv. 3fornlngton," and which was still subsisting. Thereceiver having bc,apoted in consequence of the want of proper trustes tn w7atnt having been nor supplied, he ougeht to be discharged,the receiver,moreover,having been appointed an another suit. Mr. Roltitand Mr, Freelin appeared in support of the petition, Mr. Bag.hawe and Mr Soutbgate appeared for the Earl of Mormington, and 3r. Cairns for the trustees. The Soucm on-Gmw.L and Mr. Sanwy, for Viscount Wellesley, opposed the petition, and contended that the question of the appointment of new trustees was quite independentof andheside the present question. It 6as impossible to manage these esttes without agents being appointed for that purpose, and that rendered it imperatively necessary that some check should be kept upon them and what check could be so effectual as that of a receiver? It s easy to imagine the confusion -which would arise were that officer of the Court removed. There was evidence of the state of the property previously to the present zaanagement, and that went to show the dilapidated condition of the tenements and the general miserable state to which the property had been reduced, and now the Coutx was asked to trow back the estate to that same management, and this by tse countess who had a charge of 1,5MC. per annum upon it. A charge upon the rents of the estates was a charge on the estates themselves, but the annuities feU into arrear, and those arrears now amounted to upwards of 57,00., and this was the state of things under the former management. The viscount had become bound v.ith the earl in such a way that, with other matters, I40,000M. now remained due from the father to the son snd the estates to which the viscount became entitled on his mother's death were tbus burdened to this enormous amount. Mr. Coverdale, the receiver, had a salary of 5001. n-year for his office, less than half the poundag on the rents, and was bound inavcrv large sum for the due perfornance of his duty, and Lord Welesley, in his affidavit, stated that he verily believed the trustees did not intend to manage the estate, but to employ auditors, stewards, and agents for that purpose. In S53 a liberal annual allowance to the eari was offered by the viscount through the Intervention of the Duke of Wellingtoa, but that offer was refused, because it was made a condition that the earl shall not interfere with the estates. If such a petition as this ought to have been presented at all, it should have been by the trustees, who, however, stood neuter on the occasion. If the receiver was removed, the former state of ruin would recur, and the present improvements would be at an end. The whole basis of the petition ws that money had been expended on the inheritance to the detriment of the income, and thatwas an argumentshowing the disinterestedness of the viscount, inasmuch as he had a first charge and immsens arrears still due to him; and it was a fallacy to suppose that the interests of the earl andi viscount wero antagonistic. Mr. Rolt was heard in reply. The case was argued in the Lsst week iujanuaiy, and his Monour then reserved his judgment. The ViCx-CCmSucsumO now referred to the instrunents relating to the property, and the proceedings by which the receiver had been appointed and the injunction granted, and said that, the trustees having before refused to interfere with a course of conduct pursued by the Earl of 3ornington, as to letting leases and cutting timber, in breach of the injunction, because they considered they had no power to do so, Lord Lin;dale imposed that restraint, although he refused the receiver, believing the'injunction a sufficient check; but the Vice-Chancellor of England subsequently granted a receiver, by reason of an alleged continuance of improper acts by rd Mornington, and, without questioning the proptiety of that order, the question was whether the state of things was now such as that the Court could reverse that order. His Honour then observed that it was questionable whether, indeed, he had the power to do so, or whetler it should not more properly be done on anpcal to a superior court. But it did not appear that since tihe receiver had been appointed Lord 3formngton had committed any of the acts previously alleged, and it was difficu2t not to attribute that to the effect of the injunction and receiver, and after what had taken place there was nothing to satisfy the Court or Lord Wellesley that the same acts might not be repeated if this petition was granted, for certainly the injunction was not found sufficient, for it was violated. It was true that Lord Mfornington oeffered to undertak-e not to do those acts, but could the Court compel Lord Wellesleyto be satisfied with that undertaling? No doubt it might be beneficial to let land near london on building leases, but could the Court say that Lord Wellesley might be contented with the discharge of the receiver? His Honourthoughtnot,andthatheshould beplacing matters in the same position as before if he granted the motion. It was said that Mfr. Coverdae was obnoxious to the earl, and by reason of such dislike he would refuse to do anything to benefit himself, his wife, or son; but either of the tmstecs might become so, and Lord Wellesley had no security against such an event. The petition nust therefore be refused. (eJorfec VW-Oiencelesr Sir S. STUART.) - CROwNE2 V. C BOwraI.

The property in question was copshold of the manor of Cautlowes, nd hadeen granted by Ie,e of the 27th of November 1812, by Stephen Day to Willisim Cain for the term of 2i years, at the yearly rent of 35., with a covenant by Day, the leseor, that he would, at the expiration of the term of 21 yeas (provided all arrears oof rent should then have been paid, and all the covenants thereinbefore contained should Shen have been 7ell and truly performed and kept), at the request, costs, ad chae of Cain, his executors, dministrators, an assgn:s; such reqos to be in wvriting three 3months before the expiration of the time, apply for and Drocure A license from the lord of the manor for demsn and 3etting the senme premzises for the further term of 1ygears, and so, from timueto time, uponthe expintionofeverysubsequentStermnof 21.years, rovided so request in waiting aliouidho given as aforesaid; and, wvhen such license ahould Jave been obtained.would at the request, costs, and charges of the lessee, *c. gzrant tohima or them & newr lease o>f th apremises, for such fimtherterru of 21 yer, at the anme' yearly rent, and subject4- to the same covenant8, provisoes, and agreements as contained in thee erig lee (incud3ingr the covenant for renewal). whren olere eece by Cain on par& of the land comnprised in the indenture of lease. OnD the l0th of Februay 1834, a fresh lese for 21 years was grantedR by Hoatia Jane Gill, the devisse of en.

By indenture of the 16th of December, 1843, after reciting that the coven nts for re had been dul r- formed aaio Jane Gill ad Irssm (laributt (who ws ioterestd in remainder) thereby admitted and acknowledged,- they, Miss Gill and Mrs. Cuinbult, gave -to James Green, the then lessee, full license and consent to assign the demised premises to Alfred Mortiner Job, the plntiff, -who had purchased the property. Since his purchase of the leasehold prremises heplaintiff haderected10new housesadexpended largo ssums of money upon the property. On the 6Rh of March, ..IS, the plaintiff applied in 'writing for a renevred lease of the prenu ses, fpursuant to the covenant, the term esxinn at Uristmas, 1SU The defendants refused to reneligh lease, upon the ground that the covenant to insure, which was to me amount of 1,000,. had remained unperformed during a portion of the ter, and that several of the houses had been suffered to fall into decay, inx contravention of the covenants contained in the lease. The laintiff admitted upon his bill the dilapidated condition a portien of the property, nd stated that he -had -delayed rebuilding until the question as to the renewal of the lease had been settle. Mrx. RoaT and MIr. ]Boyor, for the plaintiff, contended that the covenant on the paxt of the lessor being for a perpetual renewal, the covenant by the lessee to insure was entered into, when the property was first demised, for the purpose of securing the payment of the rent-a collaterAl matter, which was now amply provided for by the increased valueof theproperty. Upon the trueconstruction of the covenant for renewal in -the first lease, the subsequent renewals didnot depend upon performance of the covenants to insure and repair, except upon the first occasion, the essential part being the request in writing by the lessee three months before the7 expiration of the term. The case was not the ordinary one between landlord and tenant, nor could the lessor be prejudiced, as it was not intended that the property should be delivered up again, the sole object being to secure rpta payment, or, ee farm-rent of 351. a-year. The vMcE-CHANCELLOR (without callng upon Mr. Willcock and Mr. Bagsbawe, jun., forthe defence), after observing that the case was one of some hardsbip, said that he could not accede to the argument which had been urged that the string of covenants as to repai tig and nsurogthttremises was only applicable to the original lease, and had no reference to the renewed leases from time to time to be granted. It had been slso said that the covenant to nsure was only for the purpose of secring the rent, but the instrunment was not a mortgage or a rentcharge, but simply a lease, and as such it must be construed. The lessor stipulated not only for the rent, but for al the other advantages given by a lease. What equity was there for the Court to interfere between the nirties, and say that the lessor was not entitled to have the advantages for which he had stipulated-those advantages being as much part of the contract between the parties as the reserved rent? It had been further contended upon the tems of the covenant for renewal, that upon fature renewals the first condition as to payment of rent and performance of the covenants was to be dropped, and that the request in writing three months before the expiraf.on of the term was al that was necessary. The new lease, however, must contain all the same covenants as contained in the original lease, including that for renewal, which was only one of them. This identical covenant as to renewal must therefore be inserted, and, accordingly, in the lease of 1834 it was to be found in the same words-namely, as a covenant to renew upon payment of aers of rent and performance of the covenants by the lessees, asid also upon the request in vriting. It was clear tbat th- covenants must be construed strictly between the parties and that the lessor could not be called upon to renew unless there had been a strict performance on thepart of the lessees. The plaintiff was himself to some extent to blame,though the case washard. 'When ho served notice of his reqtiest for a renewal nine months before the expiration of the term, he received witbin a few days an answerwhich at once put him at arm's length by telling him that the lessor would require proofof the covenants having been performed. The plaintiff adniitted that one of the houses was in a dangerous and decaying state, and it was clearly his duty to have kept it in repair, which he neglected to do, though he might have done it within a reasonable time. It had been contended that the propertywa, upon the evidence, in as good, or no worse repairthanin 843, wvhen the lessors admitted that the eovenant to repair had been dulyperfosned,but,inhis opinion,thatwasnotborne out. There wouldbeacontnualhreacl ofthecovenanttorepair by the sapping and deterioration of property of this description during 10 years, if no steps were taken to check such falming into decay; nor could he say, upon the evidence, that the whole property was in such a state of repair as to entitle the plaintiff to a renewal of the lease. Any hope of his succeeding at law, in an action upon the eovenant, was so futile and beyond probability that he should only be putting the parties to endless expense by banging them up until the result of an action at law ws obtained. The plaintiff w;as at perfect hb,erty to have rebuilt and renared the premises. Why, then. should he have thus held his had? There was nothing to raise ag2round for interference on the part of this Court, and the billImustbe dismiissed, but, under the circumstances, 'without costs.
COURT OF OUEEN'S BENC%. GnTmnTTL A vt 2 STAT OF TInE COURT. (Sittings in Ba=, befor Laord CABELL and Common J.ZL2i.) AtthLe sitting of the Court this morning lord CASME t1 said he had received, a letter, of which, for the sake not only of his own health, but for that of the counsel, jury, and witnesses, he felt it to be his duty to take public notice. The writer stated that he was well acquainted with all the circumstances which constituted the nuisance to this and the adjoining court, and that to his lnowledge the bad smells by which they were assalledproceededfrom an ancient cemetery over which the court wes constracted. Heostated that there was anciently a chapel at Goildha l,,with a crypt andl burWiground, in which were deposited the remains of deceased mayors and aldermen of former times, and that the offensive smells now proceeded therefrom. His Lordship said he made this statement of what had come to his knowledge in the discharga of his public duty, for if the facts were as stated the lives of all were in danger. It was known that in former times the judge and. jury and counsel were sometimes all swept away by the gaol fever; but it was to be hoped that nothing of the kind would now occur to produce suah a result, and that immediate steps would ba taken to make an inquity into the subject. SIANES V. JONES. 3b. Edwin James, QC., and 31r. Barnard appeared for thel plaintiff; and lMr. Butt, QC., and Mr. ie for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action was a publican at RatoliXcross, and the defenidant a rag merchant at Wapping. The plainti£ it appeared, had taken the lease of * rarinestoreshop, 30, Broad-street, Ratcliff-cross, and put in one Palmer to carry on the business as his servant. Differences arose between them, and, Palmer disputing Haynes's rights the latter brought actions of trespass and ejectmentagainst him, recovered possession of the she, an&D took Palmer in execution for damages and costs. While Palmer carried on the business his name was ever the door, and he acted ostencibly on his own account. 3. Jones, the defendant, had dealt with him to a considerable exctent, and there was a balanceeof 36f. duefrom heron the 25th of July last. According to the plaintiff's statement, he called on the defendant On the 26th of July and showed her his book and the agreement between himnself and Palmer, proving Palmer tobe merey his servant at a weekly salary, and required payment ofthedebtonthesameday. Healsosenther a notice in writing to the same effect. On the other hand, the defendant and two witnesses negatived the plaintiff's statement, and spoke to conversations in the course of which the plaintiff had said that he had made advances to Palmer at interest, to enable him to carry on his business, and that he would be glad if the defendant would pay her debt to Palmer in his (the plaintiff's) eence, as that would help him to get his debt from Palmer. The defendant had paid the debt to Palmer under a threat of legal proceedings. Lord CAuuPsELa summed up the evidence on both sides with great minuteness, and left it to the jury to say -which side, on the whole, they could geve credit to . Thejeo jound their verdict for the defendant. THE NORTH STAFFORDSHI5r RAILWAY COMPANY V. TE LONDON A'5IT NORTH.-WRSnMN BRAIWAY COMPANY. The Attomey-General, Mr. NL Smith, <QC., and Mr. Quain apeared for the_plaintifis;, and Si'r F. Kelly, Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Bovill, Q.G, and 3ir. Phipson for the defendants. When this case was called on, Lord CAr-rmnL said, he observed that there wvere as many ples on the record as there were articles of the church of gnIand; therewereexactl 39 pleas. Sir F. KELrY said,he Lho Pthe day would soon come when there would be no pleas at alt The ATTosn,y GxN-xLa said that, bad as the case was now, that would make it far worse. Lord. CAMPBELL said, he thought it was indispensable for sCpporting the mode of trial by jury that the issues which they were to try should be prepared beforehand. But the Court had had before it severil specimens of pleading lately whichdidnotinthe remotest degree suggest the real quetions to be tried oby the jury. . Mr. QIJssa, the junior counsel, then stated that the deelaration contained four counts. The first three were to reeover danages for the breach ofan agreement whilhhad been made between the parties, under which it was alleged the defendants werebound to send their through traffic to 15an. chester along the North Staffordshire line, and to make up a. divdend Of 4 per cent, to the shareholders of that company.

On the 6t of Oot4er, 18 the arbi- trators agreedupon a zecommenjation, which theyembodied in a letter of that date, to the effeet that thetwo eompknies thould be amagamated upon the. terms that the iTorth-. WesternCompanyshould send their trafco ontheline of the North Staffordshire Company, and also makeu. a dividend of 3j- per cent. to the shareholders of t at company. It also recommended thtt the two companies should mna7e their joint applications to Parliament, at their joint expense, for an act to carry out the agreement and amagamate the companieg. The xecommendation so made was afterwards adopted by -the directors of both comyanies, and also by their respective shareholders, at sneetinge called for the purpose, the comihon |eal of both companies being attached to the agreement. lord CAMwEL 4sked whether the agreement did not contain a provision that differences should be left to the same gentlemen as arbitrators? The ATTourNx-GNm-AL said it did, and he waa wling to leave the matter to the arbitration of those two gentle. men, believing it could not be in better hands. Lord CsmmrmLL said that, with such aconfict of lawuana science,, it was impossible that such a tribunal as this could decide the dfferene. If it was not too late, his Lordship thought it would be for the esiential advantage of both companies to submit the matter to men so eminent,-the one for science and the other for law, and boti for honour. Sir F. RaMY said, the defendants had been engaged in a perpetual but vain stnigle to give effect to this agreement. Itwasbecause those gentlemen, able as the were, had reomne dthat which wsillegal ad 'mrciabeta Iord CA2sirnn. still thought that the questions at issuecmight be determined bymen of lsuch learning and Sir F. KELLY said that all matters of money 4or accunt could he settled elsewhere; but, in the first instance, the question must be settled whether the directors -who wrere acting under the vigilant eye of their shareholders, were by law authorzed in doing that which they had done for the last two years The AwoRN y-Gxm.-acr said, it seemed that n'ow an attempt wasto be ade toreditean agreement on which the parties had acted for yeams, and that, too,. iiron what the learned Attorney-General declared to be '-an unwlorthy motive"--iZ., because he traffic on the North Staffordshire line had decreased, and the agreement, which 'Was formned in favour of the defendants, had now turned against. them. The ATZos1nxY-GruEAL and Sir F. Kusa,y both agreed that it would be more satisfactory to have the decision of the Court. Lord CsArBSELL said, it seemed to biim that the ques. tions in dispute turnc on the construction of written documents, and that that course mnight be adopted. Geaneral wouldabzs,tai from wYhatX he (SirF. Kely considered an unfounded imputation upon-the North-Western CnoOmpanyvz., tb-at they were actuated by "unworthy The ATTOs.-IEY-GmsuRAL said, an attempt was nowmade to repudiate an agreement of vhich the defendants had ha the advantage for three years, and ho considered that to be a most unworthy course to be pursed. Tile seals of the two companies-had been set to resolutions adopting the agreement, and a. bill had been introduced into parliament on the Petition of the twvo companies to carry out the ageemenlt recommended by Messrs. Scott and Stephenson. By the agreement the parties were to make three joint applications to Parliament for an amalgamation biU- and, in the event of three such applications being madfe and rejected "on merits," the agreement was to be at an end. The question then wvas whether three such applications hadbeenmade andrejected "on merits " andthisdepended on whether the first aplication made for that purpos,in Itheyearet53acould be considered as rejected " on merits." It appeared that in that year a great many bills for the amalgamation of railway companies had been brought into Paria_ment, involvimg capital to an enormous amount; and, on the motion of 3r. Cardwell, a select committee was appointed to consider the nciple on which amalgamations should be sanctioned. V.n ommiteereported that, until the whole question of amalgamation could be gone into and- decded upon by the committee, they were of opinion that none of the bils for amalgamation which were then before the Hfous-e should be alowed to pas the recondi reading. The House adopted the recommendation of the select com- m ite and, accordingly, the bill which had been broukght in on the petition of the two comapanies was abandoned. It had not come to the seond reading,and there had been no decision whatever of the House on its merits. The merits of the billlhad never been discussd or considered; and, therefore, it could not be said to be rejeau ct id on merits.o The comPadneS, however, st continued to act on the aeement. In te following year, 1854, a second Amalgamation bill was brought into Darliamnent by the two compnd ies. In the meantime some of the sarehiolders in the North Staffordshire Rtailvay Company had discovered that the dividend of . 33t per cent., which the North-Western Raily comptay had agreed to imake UP, was calculated Upon awrong riacipleand thathit ought tolhave been petent. Thecdefendants were satisfiedthat this was the cs, and accorIn ly the bill of 1854 contained a Provision that the dividend i mould be 4 instead of S per cent. Tie bMil was then opposed by certain crnal intej-sts, andin the reslt it was rejectedon the mnerits. The condition of the two companies, however remained he same ur toBthe end of theyear M54. In, tie Year 185 a third joint application was made to aarlisment for an amalgamation bill, hut it was again defeated by the same canal interests. . The plainitiffs said the bill had only been rejected twice "on merits," while the defendants contended that it had been three times so rjected. The Idaintiffh issued a circular to their shareholders that they were about to make another radbee4atin for the samed purpose, but the defendants, Upon ths stted that they cosddered tihat they were absolved by their agreembent from making rany further application.

The AsTONEY-Gm-xssAL said, this was not-a case where directOrs had bouid the company, but where the shareholders themselves hd Adopted, and for three years ha: h the benefit of, the Agreement, and only repudiated it whenit became source of loss. Alnother ground vof defence was, that thepiaintifi did not co-operate with the defendants i developig the traffic on the line, and another that they increased their share and loan capital without the consent of the defendants. It would be shown, however, by.a report made 1,y the defendants directors to their shaeholders that the plaintiffs directors had been acting in "cordial co-operation' . -with them; and that though there h2ad been a small increase of the plaintiffe' share and loan lcapitaJ, it was known. to and acquiesced, in by the defenidajits. Lord OANspsB. said, as the facts appeared to be undis puted, bLe Was quite ready to give his opinio-n after hearin bth sides, or he would reserve the questions for the opinion of the Court. Acasemight easily be-stated for the opinio, Of the Court by sOmle gentleman of the bar. Sir F.

The defendants thought the plaintiffs had not co-operated with them aLs they might have expected them to do, hut hie 'would waive tilat ground of defence. . The questions for the Court would be as follows -L Whether the defendants had a~PPlied to Parlament +hree tinmes, and been defeated three times "on3merits i"-That would depend on written docu- ments -an Mr. cardwell' resolutions. 2. whether the ageeet could be legally performed, or whether it was not F tra VZMe ?-Upon that question there were many decisions in the courts, going P to the House of Lords, 3a Assuming the agreement to hebinding, whether the plaintiffs' coin- paY could sue for money, except at the endof a year?7That qustion would arise on the 1lth plea. Lord CAM3spELL said, that was but a small point, but stil the opinionuo the Court could be taken upon it. Sir F.

The cause list contains an entr7 of 4 causes. Mr. Justice t,les sat inthe civil court and was occupied al day inL trying an action of trespass to try a right of road. The case 'was very uninteresting. CROWN COURT.(Before Mr. Baron MARTn.) John Atkinson, aoedf24 as indicted for breaking and entering into the mi1 of Messrs. Foster, Gaslmrth, and Co., at Keswick, on the night of the 30th of January last, and stealing therefrom 9s. 23d. Mfr. Campb~ell Foste prosecuted, and Mr. Hodgson defended the prisoner. The case was one entirely of circumstntialevidence. The prisoner, it appeared, bad been a short time before in the employment of the prosecutors, and had thus become acquainted wit their premiises. The prosecutors re blacklead-pencil manufacturers at Keswick. A wooden building used S aL sawmillis bult up against the end of theirmil, and communicates with it, and on the night of the 30th of .Tanuary last the doors of this building and of the mill were left saify fastened. NText morning the foreman, on entering the office, 'which is a room communicating with the mil, foundthat it had been broken open, and, pon a desk were a brace and two centrebits, which had been used in boring holes in the deslk in an attemnpt to break it open.. This centrebit had been taken fiora X room in the raill, near 'where the prisoner had formerly worked. On examinig outside the mill footprints 'were found in the snow, leading to and fromn the saw-mill door, which had been opend b mens f astick, and through which an entrance opened been effcted no the milL. There were also two knee marks found in 'the anew and traces of sawdust, the person who had made the marks havingworn corduroy trouser From a drawer in theoffice 9s. 21ad had been stolen, and one of the halfpennies had been noticed by the foreman as battered and thin. A policeman having been obtained, an examination of the footprints led him, frorm some cause, to suspect the prisoner, to whose house he immediately proceeded and took himninto custody as he was dressing himself early next morning. By his bedsido were found a pair of caeorduroyn trouers, hiWch dhuesauid hethbad worn the night called "ankle acks," 'which he also had wom the night before, 'were examined and found to have sawdust adhering to te.These boots and trousers 'were compared with the footprints and knee marks outside the mil, and found to correspond exactly, and the sawlduston them was of the same colour as that in 'the milL On examining the pockets of the trousers 2Ad. in coppw, asi.pence, anda bad shilling 'were found,and one of the hnlfpeumeswvaa idennoticed, whichihad been taken fromtrerterolhnoehe mill For the defence it was contended that none of these circumstances 'were in themselves sufficiently conclusive to 'warrant the jury in finding the prisoner guilty. His LORDSEaP having summed up the evidence, The jury Acquitecd the xrisoner. Johni Just, a.ged 25, and Thomas Just, aged 23, labourers, 'were indicted for aburglaryin the dwelhg-house of Andrew Little, at Kirkandrewi-on-Bsk, on the 10th of A-ugust last, and stealing therefrom 21. 10s lr. Hodgson prosecuted; the prisoners were undefended. The prosecutor, it appeared, is an old farmer, living alone with his wife, who Is also aged, at their farm, in a secluded part of the county. About a week before the burglary in question was committed he had G0l; in his house, and this fact appearead to be Inown to a man who had lodged with them, 'who was a friend of the pri' soners. On the night of the burglary the prosecutor and his wife had gone to,bed, leaving the house safe, and the prosecutor had been asleep, when he was awakened by a noise, and askedhiswifewhat itwas. She said shethought it 'was the cat, and got up and, struckc a lighLt. Seeing nothing, she put the light out and got into bed again. Iu a short time there was another noise, and the prosecutor exclaimed, " Lord, have mercy! what's that-?' His wifd said itwas the cupboard door which hbd flown open. Presently, however, there was a louder crash, and the prosecutor saw thetwo prisoners come in at the window of his bedrooc, oneof them having his face blackened. They advanced to the bed, and one of them, using vijolent threats, demanded to know -where his maoney was, striking himn at t-he same time with a stick. He pointed to his 'waistcoat, and said All the moaney he had was in 'the pocket of it. They searched it, and, not being satisfied, one of them drsged him out of bed by the legs, and on his shouting out seized him by the throat. The other threw himseilf on the old woman, and apearedto prevent her crying o:ut. The prosecntor begged of them not to hurt his " auld wife." She was then let alone, and theprosecutor, giving no furtlerinformation about his mioney-to satisy them. was -beaten till he was insensible, and the burglars decameinpd leaving hima on the floor. The prosecutor was so injured that it was thoughithe 'would have died next day. darlynext morning the tw6 prisoners 'were met on the road leading from the prosecutor's house, And, supcion alightinig oni them, they were taken into custody, boWththe prosecutor,and his twe swearng to the identity of both prisoners, by their voices, size, an appearance.

Her Maiesty's p . ewl eelhml p Scouhe, wich left Siea Leone on the 3 int., arrived in Plymouth - Sound yesterday afternoosn The only ship of var in port when she leff, was vis e Saamader, Conmmander Georp T.; Meehan, to which-the pennant of ConmtnodoreAdams and the crew of the Scourge have been bansferredL The for tho BEghts. The sloop Philomel, 8, com er ,vs onthe orth Coast of Gambia. The brig .L3rnet, 8, Commander thnry Need, and the jorew steam aLoop Plumper, 9, C-6mmander William. HL Haswell, were on the -Socth Coast. The paddlewhee steam sloop Alecto, 6, Commander RobertPhillips, as conveying the newly-ap_ointed. Consl down the Capc Coast TThe paddlewbeel toamrvessel Antelop, 3, ieutenant-Cormander Charles H1; Young, will come home shortly with-volunteers from the African squadron. The Scourge incurred some damage at Fernando Po last Augast, and has retirned forrepairs, when sho will go back to. Sierra Leone, and receive her crew again from the Salamander. She brought a mail, some invalids, and a number of volunteers. The Coast of Africa is comparatively healthy. The Scourge called at Goree, where she left the French squadron; and at Tcneriffe, where there weresome American ships of war. When nearing lshant, on Monday afternoon, she exchanged colours with the stenship Thmnes, outward bound. The Boyal lail Company's paddlewheel steamship Ori. noco, transport No. 218, was, in accordance with orders previousy reocived from theAdmiralty, ready for the reception of troops and horses at Southampton. yesterday.

This vessel, which is -now lying in thb Southampton docks, was to receire on board at that port to-day, 217 troops and 190 horses, besides officers; but up to last evening no information had been receivedthatthey woul& positively arrive. ThexOrinoro which was to embark horses, &c., yesterday, has not yet received the Government stores, and the Candia is in a like position. The crew forboth ships have had their victualling placed on board by- their rerpective comapanies. Owing to the non-atrival of the hay, &c., for the horses andtroops (the Government undertaking to provide the necesary stores), there is little probabiliythat the troops will embark at Southampton to-day, as originally intended. The General Screw Company have received orders to pre- ' pare their four large ships--viz., the Argo, No. 81; the Calcutta, No. 195; the Queen of the South, No. 135; and the Eydaspes, No. 87, for the reception of horsesad troops. | These ships are to be fitted to convey the follvowing Calcutta, 26 officers, 140 men, and 16D horses; Argo, 28 officers, I50 men, aud 190 horses; and the Hlydaspes, and Queen of the South Will each convey 23 officers, 120. men, and 200 horses. Fach vessel wdll also have placed on board 10 tons of heavyand 200 tons of light stores. All four of these large ships 'will be ready at Southampton for the reception of their freight on the 3d1 of March, but the Com. pany have only received information that the Argo and Hydaspes will receive full pay from that date. The screw steamship Nile, 91, Captain G. 11. Mundy sailed from Plymouth for Spithead on Sunday afternoon. The hospital-ship Belleisle, 6, CommanderTJamen Hosken, left Plymouth for the Eaward on ondaLy.

The greatest activity prevails in Sheerness docLyard to complete with all possible despatch the ships now under fitment there. A new battery is now in course of construction at the dockyard at Pembroke. It is situate at. the western side of the establishment, and is intended to mount seven very heavy guns. The contractors are Messrs. Tregenna, who are pushing the works on, so that it vill soon be ready for mounting. Instructions have been receirved at head-quarters, Woolwich, from Sir lichard Dacres, commanding the Royal Artillery at the camp before Sebestopol, in which he reports that 17 companies of the siege train, consisting of 790 officers and men of the Royal Atilery Corps, would leave the Crimea for England shortly after the 5th inst. The Commandant is consequently ordered to prepare barrack accommodation for the men, who are detailed as follows:-The 2d, 6th, 7th, and 8th companies of the 11th battalior, the Ist, 2d, 3d, 6th, and 7th company of the 12th battalion, the4th company of the 2d battalion, the 8th company of the 4th battalion, and the Ist company of the 5th battalion.

'le objected altogether to the scheme of legislation wlinch the Council had adopted Insteadoffurbishing up the old stathtes, and thus encumbering us with a quantity of obsolete and useless matter, they should have begun de noro, mnalong the Oxfotd University Act their basns, ancd working out its principles. They should bave discarded the old, barbarous, and Gothic Latint froin their assemblies and their statTute-book, and should have adopted in idm of it their own mother tongue. BIe would theuliave becn sparcd the uipleasant task which he had just executed unwillingly and with difficulty. Mr. Neate having demanded a scrutiny the votes were taken, when there appeared in favorr of the statute, 21; against it, 1. The Convocation was hereupon dissolved. A Congregation was then held, and the statute on. the daties, appointment, stipend, &G., of the musical professor, the choras, and the precentor, on the exercises, &G., to be performed for nnsical degrees; and on the establishmnent of a school of practical music, was submitted to the House. Mr. G. V. Cox, of New College, noticed lwhat seemed to-him all omission in the statute. No power was given to the pro. lessor to reject Candidates for degre. Th inip=!l of Brasenose (Dr. Cradock) objected to the clatse allowing a rant of money from the 'University chest towards the expcnses of'ternoiin an exercise of muore than usual raerit. ~testabi'ohed a new- priuciple, and, he thought, a dangerous one, lie would not propose an amnendment, but lie would as'k the Council to mnalce the clause in qulestion the subject of a separate vote. The Professor of 3Music (Sir F- G. .Onscley) defended the clause. Ife observed that the persons who brought the mnost Mneritorious exercises were oiten poor, and not able to aflord the expense of having their exercises performnedso as to dot em credit. The performance wasoften wretched. The assiStance proposed would be a fair reward to those vwho exerted- themselves to bring good exercises, and the better performance of the exercises would tend to raise the standard of musical taste among the anditory. Pro. fessor Hussey observed, in reply to IIr. Cox, that the clause giving the Professor of Music powverto examine was adopted from the old statute, and that as tha proftssor rejected candidates now, he vould, of course, have the same pOwer in future. With regard to Dr. Craooek's objection, he thought, as the Universty calledupontthe candidates for ousical degrees to perform their exercises-a demanid to which there w as nothling analogous in the case of any other degree-it v-as fair that, at least in deservingecases, they should bear a portion of the e.Epensc. The joint consent of the 3.Zsieal Profesxsor, of the Vice-Chancellor, and of Convocation, which the statute required, fonuled (he thought) a sufficient safeguard against abuse. The discusion thea closed. A new statute, altering the hour at which the esaaminations miay commence, end allOwing the reappointment of Examiners at shorter intervals than heretofore, was read by the Riegistrar. MLr. liansell, of Msgdalemi College, proposed an aniendinent on tie latter point, lie thought the Exainetships in the School of L;aw and Modern }listomy ought tobe placad On the same footing as tnose ini the lathematical School. There were fewer persons in the University qualified for the fo,rmer than for the latter office. It was especially diflicult to obtain the services of a good lawyer, and when one had been secured it was ot great importance to be able to keep hinL on. 31r. D Bawlinson, of Exeter, tooXs the opportunit oitered by the proiwoigation of thme preSent statute-which ~had brought for the first tinme before Congregation the great question of restrictions uPon appointments-to throw out a suggestion that wAe should do ell to get rid of all such restrictions by which we tied our own hands, and prevented ourselves from having the se-- vices of the fittest and most eminentt men. Both the pri;ciple of rotation and that of interference with reappoint. meuxts, however soefully they might have worked in. times pt, might (he thought) be now with advantage ead. With -whomsoever the a)pTointments might in future rest, he did not fear that tavouxitism would prevail, or that persors would be reapointed on any other ground than that of erminent fitness. tt was most desirable that the University should be perfectly free to appoint on all occasions, and for all offices, the absolutely fittest man. He had not intended to propose any amendment, but as the subject would have to be rediscussed in Council, and at the suggestion of a member of the Council, he would let his view come before them in tbat shape, and wotld propose " that any and every restriction on the reappointment of Examiners be abolished." The Mlaster of Balliol (Dr. Scott) observed, with respect to the very iraportant principle which bad been brought before the ouse, that it would naturally come under the consideration of the Council at no distant tisne, and that it was not prejudged by the present statute. Thbe present statute diminished existing restrictIons. No other memuber rising to address the House, the Congregationt was dissolved.
TZE SUNDAY QUESTION. TO THE EIDITOR OF THE TIEAMS. Sir,-" A Friend of True Ieligion," in yesterday's Time, 'thinks th fomth commanldment does not forbid "amusement," though itforbids " worl," on the Sabbath day. This is anewlineofargement. Is it of anyforce? This depends on the nature of the " amnusemeut." If it conist in your correspondent's indulging himself by blowing soap bbb] es all the Sunday, one cani only pity the condition of a "Friend of Trne Religion"whosereligionfurnishesnobetter entertainment. Eut if the amusement he advocates bo, the openingof the Crystal Palace or the British Museum, ho nInst knew that hundredsmnust "worl" on the Sunday that tlzhe rest may be "1 amused. - I do not think anybody is I rwauante in working men seven days a-week in order that a number of idle people may be amused on SunC day.

Are there no preachers in this great metropolis able to interest a " Friend of True Religion." John Knox, who was as happy a man as ever lived, did not banish asmusement on Su nday. He merely opmened up a new spring of it. He wanted people to draw their 'amusement on that day froma -their Bibles; and if you2r correspondent will read his, h rwill fiLud in it history, poetry, speeches, parabtes, proverbs, naturalhistory, philosophy -in short, such ih2exhaustible sources of de-o light tfat he will call the Snnday a "delightful day," antd he will say, vith the Zing of Irael, "A day in.

RAILWAhY 19EPILLIGRyCE. 62}&OYD, WeRPA A AVVMA%T The alt irly meeting ef the companywas -held yesterday at tbS liondon tavern; Lieutenant-Colonel RuAsoot, I.. in the chair. N. T. Sssru, the secretary, read the advertisemnenit convening the meeaig. The report, an abstract of -which haseed in le Times, was taken as read. The m assEA, iu moving the adoption of fhe report, said he would make a few observations -with respect to their affairs. They were now workig the tifi-al on thelinethemselves, which he thought was a subject of coisgatulation for the shareholders. It was much snore convenient and satisfactory to work the traffic themselves tban to have it farmed and worked by a contractor. During the last half-year the company's ofrices had been removed to Worcester, and several alterations had been made, which they hoped would be eventually attended with good results. They also intenided to revise the salaries of tbe officers annually in the first mouth of every year, and to inqmre into the services performed by them. As usnal, he would call attention to two larsge items of expenditure-one for lWal expenses and- the other for engineering expenses. (vear.) tmhe legal expenses amounted to 19,339-. for valiou matters; tl'he eng deering charges were principally for promoting bills inx Pa ment, amounting to 7,5341. loe -ould be glad to furnish the particulars of those items if recuired. Theyendeavoured in the latter part of last year to form an agreement with the 0ondon and North-WesterA Companyl and Lthe 31idland Company for working the line oncertain terms, but the negotiatioins were brolen off in consequence of the latter company requiring nore control over the management than could be concededL The traffic arrangemernt ith those companies existed at present. The conmnittee of shareholders w%ho had the coideration of the matter as to the proposed agreement with the London ald tNTorth-Western and Midland Company had fuly expressed their views oni the subject, and agreed with the board in breaking- off the negotiations for a closer alliance with those companies - at the same-time they recommended that a committee of shareholders should be appointed to investigate the affairs of the company, and to report on financial and other matters Ile could only say that the board-would afford every facilit to a conimittee of investigation appointed by the meeting be thought, however, that the members constituting the former commnittee should be continued, as -they were better acquainted with the affairs of the company than new members would be. iCries of "No, no ") They wouldperceive in the report that it was estimated that the completion of the broad naue line, in addition to the narrow gauge, would cost 150,000 according to the estimates of the engineer of the Great Western Company. They would apply for further powers to Parliament to enable them to fufil6 their en agezuents. Their estimates of assets and liabilities were ratEer vague they showeed that the total amounted to 799,20!f., but the real liabilities at the present timce wvere about 218,2851. The estimated assets were about .150,000t. They had two bills now before Parliament; one was for ruising capital to comple49 the broad gauge, amounting to 150,000, , and seven separate means wvere proposed for raising the mnoniey. The first was by rmeans of debentares, the second bythe issue of ori gnal stock at a discount, the third by a preference stock ranking after the second preference, thie fourth by an addition to the first preference stock, the fifth for creating a new preference stock, and the other (either st redeemahlo or guaranteed stock. They thought it better to agree to lay down the broaa ?aege than to contest the 1satter any longer, and to Taiso the money on the best terms they could. In addition to the 150,00I. they wvould require 200,0001. for the general purposes of the company, 150,0001. on shares, and 0,1001. on loan, making togetber 350,000!., which would make uzp the deficiency shown in their rough estiroato of assets and liabIltifes. They had surplus land to dispose of and other assets, None of the powers in the bill for raising the15l,00il. for completing the broaa gaage could be exercised without the assent of three-fourths of the shareholders who milhit be affeetad by those posvers. Bat the powers for -aislng the other sumn could be exercised by the assent of three-fifths of the shareholders. Rie then alluded to the penalties they had incurred, mad to vwhieh they were liable, amounting to 5QI. per day from the 31st of May las, for not completing the broad gauge on their line. It anmouted, in fact, to 18,0001. a- year until the broad gauge was completed on the Oxford, 'Worcester, and WolVTerhaSaton line. With the concarrence of the Great Wester Company, the Roard of Trade had agreed not to enforce the penalty due up to the Slst inst. They Mwould perceive that tho necessities of the company weera very great, for the net revenue was taken. week bweek for the purpose of paying the debts of the cOmpanu, and it was by no means sufflcient for the puirpose. They were devising various plans for the improvement of the railway. They had adopted the South-Eastern Railfway System of telegraphing every train on leaving a station, and one wire was used cstiosally for that purpose. Nothing would justify them in neglecting anuything that would tend to the safety of the public travelling over their line, and making it as perfect as it could be inade, He thought their line would bear comparison with any line in the kingdom, They -were bound to provide for the safety of the public as much as possible, because in case of accident the damages would be exceedingly heavy. The bill No. 2 vas for authorizing the extension of time for completing the line and works and to snace arrangements with the Great Western Company for laying down the broad gauge. He considered the Oxford and Wolverhampton as essentily a narrow gauge line, for a very large number of proprietors of Staffordshire -would not send trucks over the line if it -were on the broad gauge, as the trucks were on the uaarrow gauge. sbth regard to the traffic, they could get much snore if they had more stock, and they found from experienoe that as tbey increased their working stoekl, and afforded more accomnmodation in sidings and at stations, the traffic increased also. There was a discrepancy in the former aeo&unts of the companyiamounting to 10,0001., in respect of eitiinattrnffic the matteT bad been investigated by their accountant, and the result was that he found it to be 5,674l., but that wvas subject to certain contingenLcies-a claim on the Midland, and also on the Great Western, for running over a portion. of their line; it was imapossible to state the exact sum 3Mr. Tsiiuv-, one of the auditors, requested the chairman toreadkthe auditors report, which was not published by the corpany. The C st read the report of the allditors. It complained that several surs given in the trafflc account were only estimates of trafic bythe officers, and that the amounts had not bcer, paid oves to the company. There was also a sum of 371l. charged by the banker as comnijasion, being at the rate of 4 per cent. on sums advanced to the company. Ee said the aeccuntsawere clear, whatevermigist be the views of the auditors. He concluded by sugesting that 2,000!. or 15 0001. should be expended by sorne one on the comnany's landat Worcester, to build cottages for the servants (f the company' the houses could be built for 1201. each, rndcouldbelet for 81. a-year. (Cries of "No, no I") lMr. P1UscLSGTOS, a director, seconded the notion forthe adoption of the report and accounts, and in doing so remarked that the penalty for not completing the broad gauge was 1S,000!. a^:rear, wvhile the interest on the cost of layinlg dowvn the additional rails would naob be above 9,000!. a-vear at 6 per cent.; therefore by doing so they would save a the amount of the penalty. (lEear, hear.) Mlir. TuMLy stated that of the 23,000!. prposed fot di vidend there was 5,7417. estimated to be dle from the Great Western and 3iMdland Companies, but it had notbeen paid. There W asa sim of 5 4th estmated in a fomer aecusort that had not been paid, and he found altoltether that there was a sun of 14,6331 dueby tbree compames tothe reveu,e, and that would niake a very material diference ix re.spect to the 23,0001. It vas necessary that these facts shoutd be stated. (Hear, hear.) There was also a sum of 43,5001. due on account of goods convoyed over the line sinte 1852 some portion of which must be considered as bad-,say about 2,OW10 thaavroulreduce the item to 41,M1. He suggested that the dividend should be 2 Per cent. on the preference shares, which would absorb 16,400f., and leave a margin of 7,0001. to meet those contingencies. It -was a question whether the banker should have charged 379e. for comnni-sion in respect to debentures and cheeks. Mi-. L vAxs, the banker, said, the san in question was charged in accordance, with an agreement to that effiect, and the company ras allowed 4 per cenit. on daily balances.. Re had no objectionto show his books to any one from the orto the auditors. X. . PLsisoss complained of the mode in which it was proposed to raise the additional capital, and stated that if the proposition were cartied out it would be nothing less than committing an act of bad faith tor'ards the first preference shareholderm Be protested against theprinciple of the provisons in the bill. - Mr. MAXwEnL proposed the appointment of a comunittee of shareholders to invsigate the affairs of the company. Hethought the position of the co apany would improvO whten the money-market was ins a norefavourablo state, and that varions itemLs might be cut dowvn to cash prices if their liabilities were properly inauired into and ascertained. hiajor COniep remrkged that somoething most no v-be done to raise the requisite fends to release the company from its liabilities. They had expended a vast dea of money in resisting their engagement to lay down the broad gauge, but at length they were compelled to filfil their engagements to the Great Weste Company. The least objectionable plan for rarisig the money would bo by the issue of debentures, say at 6 per cent. for three years, or a Iihaited timne. 3r. Serieaut GAnnns said, he had no ornldence in the board, and he considered that each of the directors'should hol a lare stake int concern, and gLee up a. portion of the sum allowed them for remuneration, towards effecting -the economy referredto in the report. he bils they were promnoting in Parliamnentwere of a reynrpatrngcharacter, becaulse they aimed at destroying the vested rights of the p reference shareholders. He contended that the- share h olders had never been fairly man honestly represented on !the board Mr. laNrowN suid, it appeared they were iu the greatest confasion. He thought if they appointed a comomittee they shonld elect members interested in 'the first and second preference shares, as well as the original s7ares, so that they might by a -kdnd of mutual concession protect the interests of all classes. Mr. PiSoN, deputy-chairman, explained that the co-mpany had 200,000. worth of working stock Ixn the line subject only to W0,0001. due to the contractor. Mhay would only require a potion of the estimated outlay to provide more working sfock to accommodatothe tnfMoand c&6pleto she broad gauge, for which they -would enLdeavour to obtain as much tune as possible. With regard to the olscrva'tons cf Mr. Tamlyzi with respect to the estimated sums due from othercompas2ies, it onyseqoired a settlemnt, wbichthey were promised, to. close the account; and as to the 43,)001. due to'the company, no part of it -was a bad debt; about 20,0001. of it wRas duo wvithin the last month, for the accounts Nvith the merchats were made up nonthly and paid about a moonth afterwards. There was very ittle of that Dnm due longer than three months. Re hoped -the asegotia*tloiss with thbe North-Western and Midland - woutld te renewed, and a permanent arangenent be. entered int4. Thepropositionwas broken off becausethe3Mldland v wanted to exercise ahisolute power over their officers.
