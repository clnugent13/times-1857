TIM TLACST FR'OM a NMED STAM,-We ihink lit our duty,to caution our readers against any undue ilarimn regard to the last news from the United States. Ihe papers state, apparently upon authority, that Mr. 'Buchanan has been positively instrcted to dentandthe re ,call of Mr. Crampton, our Minister at Washington, on account-of the part he took in the enlistment of American. tizens for the British service. Be that as it may, it is cerfain our Government will decline such a demand, if made - for no sound-headed and right-minded man can have read the correspondence between the two Governments on this subject without seeing, in the first place, that there was no ,complicity on the part of Mr. Crampton in those transacCions; in the next place, that anv ground of complaint arose entirely either from errors on the part of agents employed, or in their having acted beyond and against their inatructions; and, in the last place, that whether errors had been committed or instructions exceeded, full and amnle Teparation had been made by an apology from the Britifsh Government. There is only one word in the English lan. guage which fairly represents conduct whicn, after such a course, stEi seeks to fastena quarrel upon a goodbnd powerfulnleighbour. Rappily, however, for us;,the great majority of the American people are as much alive as we are to the course which good taste, good sense, and patriotic priniple -lictate under such circumstances, and we have the best 2neans of knowing that President Pierce is looked upon with as much displeasure by a majority of the American citizens as he is in this country. Indeed, it wouldappearas if every man in the United States who enjoyed any weight in the country, who was independent of the Government of the 1'resident for the time being, and who had a correspondent in this country, had availed himself of the l1st mail to tell na that we must regard all this vapouring as the thunder of :lr. Pierce, unsupported by the American people. This we re4* believe to be the case; and that when the small clique *ho for their own selfish ends would not hesitate to embroil t°o great nations in a dispute find that alieady a preli2nIDrtra,3 of peace is signed with Riwsiz, and an armis-' tice estebljihed, they'will quaietly accquegce in the more senrib]e and patriotic vpiews hich tic great biMssf tle peop2e jg ,b,. euties eoanl-,conQmist 4,
BANQUET TO LIEUTENANT-GENERAL PATICK GRANT.

In order to give due Jceat to an event which might therefore be said to inalgurate a new epoch in the annals of the Indian amy, and which also promises to give I incressed efridency to an important branch of the l public service, the banquet was on a scale of' magnifi. cence excelling the splendid hospitality for which the great . corporation under whose auspices it was held is so-justly -celebrated, Lord Palmerston. who had been invited'to be present, was uiable to attend; but in the absence of the. noble Premnier, the Government was represented byhis i Grace the Duke of Argyll, Lord Sbnley of Alderley, the Right Hon. Vernon Smith, the Right Hon. W. G. Aayter, and the-Right Hon. -Robert -Lowe. Mr. Elliot Macnaghten (the chairman of the Court of Directors) piesided, the seat. imniediately on his right being occupied by I lieutenant-General' Patrick Grant, and that on his left ;by 'Viscount Gough, G.C.B.

The principal table was adorned bythe splendidtestimonialpresented to General Gilbert for his brilliant services in the Sikh campaign, and which consists of an exquisite representation in silver of the defeated Sikh warriors in the act of surrendering their arms to their British conquerors. The galery of the banquet-room was occupied after dinner by a party of distinguished ladies. On the removal of the cloth the usual loyal toasts were given from the chair, and receivedwith general acclamation. The CEiAm3LA2, in proposing the toast of the evening, said,-My lords and gentlemen, I now beg to. propose to you the health of my gallaut friend on the right, Lieu. tenant-General Patrick Grant. (Cheers.) It has very fre quently been our duty and our pleasure to entertain distinguished officers of Her Majesty's service upon their appointment to chief commands in India, but we have met together this evening on a novel and most interesting occasion. (Loud cheers.) We are not now, as has heretofore been the ease, receiving an officer into our service (hear, hear), we are confiding to one already in it, and who by a long and honourable careerhas established a just claim toour eonsideration, the highest office and the proudest position to whichasoldiercanaspire. (Cheers.) Wenow forthefirst time welcome an officer of the Company's service as Commander-in-Chief of the Madras army. (Chees) The Court of Directors have long and anxiously striven for the accom- lishment of the object now so happily attained, and we nave ever felt that our failure hitherto has not been attributable to any want of officers in the Company's armv in all resPects qualified for such commands. (Hear, hear.) The names of Malcolm, Ochterlony, Pollock, Nott, and many others forbid such a supposition. (Loud cheers.) The wall of partition, however, between the Queen's and the Company's army has now been broken downthe system of exclusion no longer obtains, and, as i beleve, to the entire and cordial satisfaction of the best and most generous officerc in both armies, the field of selection is now thrown frely open. (Great cheering.) We feel deeply grateful to Her Maresty, to Her Majestys 1inistes, and to all those who have assisted in bringing about this long-desired and happy consummation. General Grant has been in the Company's army for some 35 or 36 years. (Cheers.) He has fought and bled in our service, and bears on his person the decorations for the several battles of Maharajpore, of Moodkee, of Sobraon, of Chilldanwallah, and of - Gooerat. - (Loud cheemr) He has also, and. for many years, fllled -the responsible office of Adjutant-General of thevBengal Army and he has thus had the opportunity of aeqursngoprecidey that kind.of experience in the dsnipone andmanagement of troops,-both in quarters andin the ield vwhich is of inestimable value in a commander.in.chief. (Cheers.) In the conduct of his several duties he has manifested all those qualities of firmness, impartiality, evenness of -temper, and zeal for the public service which are so essen. tially necessary in the position to which he has been raised. Welullyanticipate that his commandi will be attended with the best results. Vear, hear.) He wi find the Madras army in the hignest state of efflciency and immediately readyfor every duty. (Loud cheers.) I have only further to express my sncere and earnest hope,--in which Ifeel lre, mayilords and gentlemen, you will most cordially join,-that through'the blessing of the Alnaighty our friend miy be permitted at the close of his service in India to return with unbrolken health and with increased miditary reputation to the enjoyment of that repose in his native land to which he willbe then so well entitled. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I give you "The Health of my gallant friend Lieutenant-Ge. neralPatrick Grant." (The toast was drunk amid much enthusiasm.) eduteanartienerai StMANcT, in responding, said,-I thank you heartily, my lords and gentlemen, for the favour with which you have received the toast that has just been pro - posed to you from the chair. To you, Sir, I feel more in debted than wordc can express; and I beg that you will believe that I shall ever retain a grateful sense of your surpassing kindness. (Cheers.) These are indeed memorable times for the Indian army. Her Majesty has been gra. ciously pleased to assure to us our military rank all over the world. (Hear.) Our rank is no longer, as heretofore, merely local ; it extends to every portion of Her Mtajesty's dominions at home as well as abrQad; and we have now in my appointment a practical acknowledgment that we are ;deemed eligible for the highest military comnmands. 7(Cheers.) I take upon myself to assure all who have aided in bringing about these results that their generous exertions Ein the cause-(may I not say?)-of common sense and sound i policy are -gratefully appreciated by every member of the vast army of India, whose loyalty, fidelity, and attachment to their Sovereign and their country never have been and I firmly b;lieve never can justly be called in question. (Cheers.) I shall go to India unfettered by p2edge or promise of any kind, resolved to devote every energy I possess to the discharge of the important duties devolved upon 3me, and with a single eye to the efficiency and well. I being of the public service. (Hear, hear.) I feel that I am undertaking vhat would be a very grave responsibilty for any one, but for me it is peculiarly so; and I can only pray God to enable me to acquit myself to the satisfaction of the high authorities who have done me the honour of selecting 'me for the proud position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armyof Madras,the promotion being additionally gratifying to me from the cireumstance of my being the first officer in the Company's service apon whom that high distinction has 1ever been conferred. (Cheers.) You, Sir. Chairman, have been pleased to refer to my humble services in India in terms far moreIlattering thanI deserve. Such as they are, jhowever, those services were rendered under Lord Gough whom I rejoice to see present, and who is one of the ablest md most successful Commanders-in-Chief that we have ever seen.- (Cheers.) It was my good fortne to be at the head of the staff during the whole of that noble lord's Indian campaigns, and I can truly say that to myself as well as to every other officer on that staff it was a labour of love as 3much as a duty to carry out his Lordship's orders and instructions to the best of our ability. (Hear, hear.) In the gallant aamy which he so nobly led, and always to assured victory, there were none-not onc, from the soldier in the i ranks up to the general of division-who did not feel honoured by serving under such a skllful commander ; and, if his faithful followers should l:e permitted to participate, in however slight a degree, in his glorious fame, they will be, indeed, amply and richly rewardeL (Hear.) My lords and gentlemen, you will not expect a leHngthened speech from an old soldier who has seen 35 years of service, having commenced his professional career at the early age of lo, and who this evening, for the first time in his Ife addresses a public assembly - and therefore I simplyTeg againtothank you, which I do from my heart, for the distingished honour you have conferred upon mc. '(oud cheers.) The Car rsejI, in proposing the next toast, said the national toast of " The Army and Navy" always commands attention and a heartfelt response. (Hear.) Under existing circumstances the toast is entitled to special consideration. Without achieving the impossibilities which some people appearto have ctd from them, both services have nobly performed every duty to which they have been called, and in their recent active operations with the enemy have established fresh chais on the gratitude of thecountry I rejoice to be able to associabewith this toast the names of two gllant officers who have nob only served Her Majesty with honour and distinctionm bt have also greatly distinguished thenmselves in the service of the East India Company. I allude toour old friendGeneral Lord Gogh and to Sir Stephen Lushington, who was amost eficent comaander of our Indian navy. (Loudcheers.) Viscount GoucGs, in responding on behalf of the anmy; said,-1y lords and gentlemen, permit me to express my warm thanks for the higl complimenb you have paid to the: service'to which I,have the honour to belong.

(Cheers.) fo man can tell better than I can the infnuence of prolonged Wwar fare in promoting the greater effidency of an army. As n old Pennsular officer, who had the command of a regiment from the commencement up to nearly teclose of the late war, I can well remember the very marked difference there was:between our army as it was in thyear 1808 and as it -stood in 1812; and-rest assured, gentlemen, that, should the -present contest continue, the same happy results will follow in thecase-of our gallant army.now in the Crimea. (Cheern.) Iexr-Admiral LusunLNrGToy, in returning thanks for the navy, observed that never was the British navy in a state of greater areparation for the renewal of hostilities than it is atpresent. We had now the best fleetequipped that was ever known in England or in any other country, and before the returns of the spring we should have no fewer than 400 gunboats ready to-attack -Russia or to undertake any other. service, (Cheers.) The CnsisAmR3 then said,-3fy lords and gentlemen, I now invite you to drink "$The health of Her Mlajestsy's M£inisters." {Cheers.) I greatly regret the unavoidable absence on this occasion of the ]Fst Lord of the Treasury ear, hear), for I was anxious to express in his presence how much we fed indebted to him and his colleagues for the appointment of my gallant friend. (Cheers.) Those whom - ler Majesty igraiously pleased to select for her servants oare at all times entitled to our respect and sympathy, bnt our warmest acknowrledg-ments are peculiarly their due wvhenthey stand braveIy ~forv,ard to take the helm in times of danger- and dificulty. (Hear, hear.) Lord Palmerston was the first to foresee that the time wras approaching whEen it would be necessary to restrain the lawless ambition of Russia, and who, called to preside over Her Majesty's council at a crisis of no ordinary embarrssment, has secured the confidence and the gratitude of the nation by a vigorous and unswerving policy which cannot fail to result, though perhaps not immediately, in an honourable and lasting -peace. (Cheers.) I beg to associate with this toast the name of his Grace the DDke of Argy]L. (Cheers.) The Duke of AiiGxmL aknowledged the toast, and sid,Mr. Chairman, I experienee the greatest pleasure in being present on this festive occasion; not merely because of the general and daily increasing interest felt by the great body of the people of England in the affairs of India, nor because the officer whom we are here to honour is a distinguished. countryman of mine-for, as a Highlander, I am proud to claim him as a fellow-countryman, and really I should have known him to be such to-night had my eyes been shut (" Hear, hear," and a laugh);-but chiefly from my deep andlorg-cherished conviction of the justice and policy of the principle which has obtained the cordial support of my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Control, and also received the final sanction of the Crown. (Hear, hear.) It is surely impossible to doubt that the welfare of our Eastern empire. and the honour of England are deeply concemed in our maintaining the high character of the Indian army. lNo principle can be more calculated to attract to that army men of energy, intelligence, and honourable ambition than one which secures to those who enter its ranks the highest honours and dignities of their profession (cheers); and the adoptionof this rule, so far from being hostile to the interests of the Imperial army, will, I believe, tendrather to strengthen the bonds of that brotherhood in which these two great services have so often stood shoulder to- shoulder -on the field of battle to uphold the - sceptre ef their common Sovereign. (Hear, hear.) I trust it wil not be wholly irrelevant if in responding to this toast I allude to that policy which alarge portion of Europe has ascribed to the British Government and to those to whose administration of the affairs of India that Government looks with the most perfect confidence for the peace and security of that empire, in connexion vwith the recent course of political events in that distant quarter. I do not mean to deny that circumstanceswhichhaveoccurredandare stilLoccuring-inWesteraAsia may deserve the attention of the British Government; but I hold that these events are interesting to us rather from their connexion with the! cause of Turkey, and with those other questions in which w. e are concerned as one of the great European Powers, than as having any direct' relation to the welfare of our Indian empire. It is now more than 1 O years since the Caspian was first covered with Russian arnaments; and it is doubt- ful whether or not the command of that sea as now wielded - bythe Emperor Alexander is more real or more secure, although it may be more formally acknowledged, than that exercisedby Peter the Great. What have weonourpat been doingduringthe'interval that hassince elapseds why,l}3) ears ago even the foundations of our present Indian empire avd scarcely been Laid. The glories of the Wellesleys, of a Cornwallis, a H3astings, and a Clive were then stillhidden in a remote and -improbable future; and all that England owned in Hindostan, al that foreshadowed the magnificent palaces' of Calcutta, the seat of Go- vernment of a wonderful enipire, were a few sdattered - aind inoignificant mercantile establishments on the banks of the.Hoogley. Andif inthenexthalfeenturyweandthose wwho succeed us in the government of this country only- put to,one-half as good usury, as our illustrious predecessors did thexesourcesatour disposal for extending and improving that splendid empire, no external Power, be itlRussia or he it- any other, need give us one moment's serious uneasiness. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, on behalf of myself and of the mem- bersof the Government not now present, I bepg again to(thank you for your manifestations of approvaL The Go-. verlment of Lord Palmerston, it is trae, holds the reins of power in a criod of great difficulty and responsibility, but that diffi ty and that responsibility have been, and are - now, immense_ lightened by the noble spirit which animates the people. M e. eel confident that the good sense of the country will sustain us in endeavouring to secure an honourable peace, but iA unfortunately, such a peace should at the present escapeour grasp, sure we are that the courage and energy of a highminded nation will uphold us with yet greater vigour in our efforts to extort that result by force. (Loud cheers.) The CHIRMN then sald,-I have now the honour to propose to you the health of my right hon. friendthe President of the Board of ControL (Cheers.) The toast is so intiimatel6yeonnectediwiththe goodgovernment of India thatit requires-no explanation from me to recommend it to your especial attention. Since I have had the honour s nd the pnvilege of official intercourse with Mr. Vernon Smith, I can truly say that he has evinced the most zealous regarI forthe welfare of India. (" Hear," and cheers.) Il;mow he has been warmly interested, and I believe he has been mainly instrumental, in the success of the event which we are now celebrating - an event which will impart to his administration an honourable distinction, and leave a grateful recollection in the heart of every member of that noble army whose cause he has so ably advocated, and whose rights he has so -successfully vindicated and maintained. (Cheers.) The toast was drunk with much cordiality. The Right Hon. VunNON Saicrir, in returning thanks, observed that when he entered upon his present office he found that applications had been repeatedly made by the Court of Directors for the promotion by Her Majesty's Government of deserving Company's officers. Those appli. cations had been acknowledged occasionaliy compliance with them had been promised rarely, but they had been acceded to never. (Hear, hear.) When the war first broke out a cry arose throughout the country for the employment of Indian officers in the Crimea; and, feeling that those who shared the dangers and,hardships of the service, no matter in what clime, ought to be allowed to reap the honours of command, he could not consent to be a party to shouldering meritorious menout of the prefermentstowhich they -were entitled to aspir. (Hear.) The Company's service was, indeed, a well-paid service, but the profession of arms was one of honour as well as of enmolument. He could, not believe that any unworthy jealousy was entertained by the Queen's officers towards the Company's service; and,. looking at the eulogisSic terms in which Lord Dalhousie mi his despatch spoke of the recent successful expedition of Commander Chamberlayne in India, the Government might feel justly proud in possessing troops who could perform and officers who could plan and lead such heroic exploits. (Cheers.) . It would be graifying to him (Mr. Vernon Smith) to know that during his tenure of office that door to promotion which had hitherto been shut against the Company's officers had been first opened to them. It had been his good fortune to be present in his official capacity at a similar festivity to that, when General Vivian was appointed to the comrmond of the Turkish Contingent,-a corps, he might observe, which was now in a condition to afford great assistance, if necessary, to Her Majesty's army in the East. He recognized aroundthat board many faces which he saw in that hall onthepre- vious occasion to which he had -refer red,but h_e-coulIdWnotfai to miss the maonly counteniance of that brave, accomiplishedl, and promnising young Indian officer, Brigadier Maye, whose loss, alas! they had been called upeon deeply to deplore. Herhear.) India was tranquil, te Santal ins,Tecton anghappily been suppressed; and the only danger, br rate-r alleged danger, which now threatened was that which had been hruited abroad by European nations who were jealous of our rich Asiatic dominions. Ire wtas sorry to see it aisDo serd ythe malignity of faction at home, that if Russia were compelled to abandon her aggressive deaigus in Euro she would be sur to make an outburst upon us in MRia. (Hlear, hear.) Should Russia incautiously soeek such an-outlet for her military enterprise, she *ould have to encounter the all but insuperable difficultiesinterposed against her advance by the rugged natural defences of our Eastern possessions ; but, supposing her' -to overcomie afll these formdla'ble obstacles, her igeions-would' find arrayed aggainst them, on their arrival on our frontier, exhausted no doubt, by the harassing opposition of hostil tribes, andLfrom the deficiencies of their own commissariat, a vast, highly, disciplined, and well equipped armny, which would be certain to indlict upon them aneasy and signal chastisement.

(Applause.) , Lord OUl=PiLL said that he had very unexpectedly, and for4 the first time in his life, been called upon to respond tothis toast, having hitherto, although hi: had been a member of tho HousO of Peers for 15 years, escaped the perils sttending the discharge of that duty. (A laugh.) He was noS ashamed to belongto that distinguished body,which had ever been the friend of freedom, and which, althongb it had been held to be a little backward at times, had yet, under the influence of a gentle stimulus, always responded in the long run to the healthy impulses of public opinion. It ws novr sSd, however, that the Upper Chamber of the Legislature must be reformed, and a new batch of peers was about to be created. That was not a fitting occasion for him to discuss whether or not such a measure was legal and constitutionaL On that subject they wvould probably' ear more onThursday next (a laugh), but, for his ownpart, he -entertained no apprehension of the result of the contein- plated proceeding; and he could only say that if it was really legal, and also if any of the gentlemen p resent were ~destmned tobomadepeers forlife, theywould beosure of-acourteous reception from the House of lords {laaghter) where it was to be hoped they would show as devotoeda seal -for the honour of the Crown and for the libertfes and the p rosperity of -the pueoplo as had been displayed by the here- The Right Hon.

(ear, hear.l The CmAIrM next proposed "The Civil Service of India," which was briefly acknowledged by Mr. MlLeod. The Eight Hon. R. Lowrn, ILP., begged permission to propose a toast-viZ., the health of the chainman of the great corporation which had so nobly entertamed them at its board that evening, and who had presided over that splendid festival with so much dignity and urbanity. (Cheers.) He congratulated the chairman of the East India Company that it should have happened-witbin his presidential term that an act of tardy justice had been done to the Indian army. (Hear.) The name of that gentleman' already illustrious in Indian annals, would be associated with the first noble effort to break down that most unwise and unjust distietion which had hitherbo separated the two gallant military services, both bearing Her iajesty's commission. (Cheers.) We had recently learnt by bitter but wholesome experience to appreciate what was really requiredto qualify a man for the soldier's vocation, and to recognize that it was not merely dash and courage in action which constituted the great ox the successful captain, but that there was also demanded skill, energy, and powers of calculation and combination such as fell not to the lot of every man, however brave or intrepid he mght be. It was earnestUytobehopedthat we hadbeen taught to render more honour and to do more jtiire than, sitting, as we had been, on tho easy couch of Peace, we were perhaps disosed to 2ccord to those gallant officers of the Indian army who were in the constaut habit of manipulating, disciplining, combining, and marching through enormous deserts vast masses of troops, and of conducting them with rare skiU and fore. sight from victory to victory through a sezies of wars, not one of which was inglorious (Cheers.) If to the lesson we had learnt n this retw owed the appointment of the distinguished officer who woud go forth f rom that banquet to receive the well-earned reward not only of toils and dangers shared by him with the meanest sentinel in the army, but of those admirable powers. of combination and sagacity whicliwere so invaluable in the bearer of command; if our reverses had taught us at last to recognize merit wherever it was to be found, and to think less of the arEficial dams -which society had set up to divide different branches of the same service from each other, then, indeed, it might justly be said that a stern experience had proved salutary to us, and had been given to us, no doubt, fora wise and beneficent purpose.

(Cheers.) It occupies territories aslarge aslurope, and we cannot therefore be surprised. that it is not generally available for service out of India. The zeal of its troops would lead them any where, and, although regiments of the fiative army have nst been sent to Europe, many of the officers of that gallant service have been employed by Her Ilajesty, and have greatly.distin.i gished themselves in the late war.

Lows exposi-n tion of the Government bils to amend the lawS of atnership, andfor theincorportion and regulation ofjoint-stock companies. Based entirely uponf she principle that it is the right of the people to snake what contraets they please among themselves, fhey sweep away all the prohibitions and the oiniserial powsers of granting exclusive privileges Ahich during the past generation have kept up that pater3 system wvhich placed our domestic commerce -holly outof harmony with our political institulions. The irst of the two bils simply proposes to lIow persons to lend money to partnerships upony condition of receiving a share Of the profits, ghithout ;renaering themselves liabIe to any loss beyond that f the suWm thus advanced. The second bilI pro- poses a thorough reform of the joint-stock system, D *which, with one or two exceptions which the Government regret to be obliged to make, whill free it for ever from the complications nmd snares ohitherto consequent upon inducing individuals io rely utpon the protection of the State, instead ef upon their own vigilance. The Joint Stock Companies Acts and the Limited Liability Act of last cossion are to be repealed, and the new bill wil pro-vide that all partnerships of more than six members l way avail themselves of the full advantages of inscorporation, with limited liability, upon complying withcertaininexpensiveformalities, hichwiilimpose no restraint upon their freedom of action in respect ;to capital, management, or any other point. A imemorandum of association.and registration, signed by seven shareholders, stating the name of the pro-m posei company, its objects, the number of shares znto which it rs to be divided, and whether the liability of the shareholders is to be limited or nnlimited, upon being filed with the Registrar o Joditstock Companies, will entitle the company to registration, after which it will possess all the rights of a eorporation, including that of suing and being sued. Atthe samehtime the Government will furnish a pattern of articles of association, embodying all the ordinary conditions of a deed of settlement, wnhich may be adopted without any expense, or the company may prepare and file its owvn memorandum of association. Each company will be left to -orm its owvn constitution as it pleases, but, If the constithtion thus provided by the act be Citable to h e the pomer they will have the ndvantage of being able to adopt it without cost. All companies are to be compelled, under penalties, to keep a register of their own sharetholders, hich is to be accessible to the public, and 3 uniform balance-sheet is annually to be deposted. Shareholders holding a fifth part of the shares may happly, at their own expense, to have the aeairs of -any company inspected by the Board of Trade, ond the report thus obtained vill bed their ow property, which they may publish or not mas they see fit. Wuith regard to the widingup of companies, the existing windfig-up Act is to be repealed, and the provisions in its place anre to be as follows :-A company may be wound up by the Court whenever three-fourths innumberof the shareholders, holding half the capital, shall adopt aresoltion to that effect, whenever it suspends business for the space of a year, wheneverthe sharelolders are reduced below seven in number, whenGever it neglects for three weeks to pay a debt of which notice has been served, or whenever, upon petition, after hearing both sides, it is declared by -the Court that the step wil be for the interest of the shareholders and not injurious to the public, the -Court having the power to orderf either that the winding up be absolute or that it shall take place tha,ess the debts of the company be paid sithin a 0ertai1 time. Hfampered by no other conditions than these indispensable ones, companies wi enioyall that freedomtof individual action which has hitherto bieen an exclusive privilegte of private partnerships, while at the same time, possessing no powers of evasion unklnown to individuals, they will ibe brought within the summary scope of the ordinary eourts of justice in a way that will be cleartto the comprehension of everybody. Any nmcasure, short of complete freedom, Hould fail to attan nthis end, and althoug7h probably, even among the supporters of the new bills, there will be foaud e number of persons each with his o-vn peculiar -crotchet of some sma and exceptional piece of State interference he wvould stilllike to he introduced for the "protection" of the public, it isto be h1oped that the general opinion of the commercial community will be so expressed as to enable the GEovernment to resist all attempts to break up their ucoherent adhesion to the grand principle uponwhich they desire to stand. The undertak;ings which in deference to certain .prejudices the Government have felt it necessary to exclude from the operation of their. bill are banking -and assurance companies. It is also to be mentioned that, wfhile it is left optional for all companies not consisting of more than 20 memberts to avail themselves of the advantages of incorporation, it will be vcompulsory on every new one formed under the act, having abeve 20members, to adopt that form of conattution, in order that legal proceedings against them mazy be rendered easy. The shipments of specie by the Peninsutlar and Oriental steamer Ava amount to the heavy sum of 492,4001., of which 26,7001. is gold -for Ceylon, 3Madras, Calcutta, Singapore, iHongkQong-, and ~Alexandria , and 465,7001. silver fur Calcutta, Bombay, Pena3g, Sintgapore, Hongwkong, Canton, and Shanghai. The specie arrivals of the week have been under 0O0,000. ,, The railway meetings of the week have not been IMrraerous. A majority of the shareholders of the Scottish Gentral have sanctioned the proposedworkang ag,reement with the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Company. The directors - of the London and South-Western Railway recommend the payment of X. dividend at the rate of 51. 12s. 6d. per annum for the half-year, making with the previous payment atotal of 51. per cent. for the year. At the meeting of the Llanelly Railway the dividend declared was II. per share on the original shares, and it is stated that the works on the Llandilo extension are proceeding in a satisfactory manner. SPhe dividend of 21. 18s. per cent., proposed by the directors of the Brighton Company, maldng with the' former distribution, 5 per cent. for the whole year, hasbeen confirmed, and tho report, on the whole, is regarded as favourable. The report of the. North Staffordshire Company has been zdopted, and the directors have commenced proseedings to recover the rent due from the London send North-Western Railway. Meanwhile measures sire under consideration for advancing the posi{tQA Qf the undertaking by extending its route to Liverpelywhile an independent outlet to London it is-;thoughtmay be eventually' secured through the Leicester and Hitchen line.

RAILWAY INTELLrGENCE. EASTERN COUNTIES. At the half-yearly meeting of this company to be held on Friday, the 29th inst., there wil be two vacancies to fill up at the board in consequence of the retirement of Lord Alfred Paget, MP., and Mr. J. Packe. Mr. D. Wadding. ton retires by rotation, but is ligible for se-election. It is believed that the result of the half-year's working to the end of December last will be satisfactory to the shareholders. The traffic receipts show an increase of 24,300!. over those of the corresponding period of 1854. SBIREWSBURY AND CREWE. - OnFriday an influential mneetmgv,asheld at-Whitchurch, Salop, to consider what steps should be taken in reference to a tll promoted by the London and Nrorth-Western Company for altering the Shrewsbury and Crewe Railway and obtwaingan extension of time for its completion. Major Cotton was called to the chair. The Hon. EDwARD Kmirox, in proposingthe first resolution, said it appeared that the North-Westem Companv were desirous to have the time fixed by the Shrewsbury and Crewe Act for the completion of the lie extended from August, 1858, to August, 1859, and in the proposed bill there was a blank for the date, in which any year might be inserted instead of 1859. If they were certain that the line would be finished in 1859, they shbuld think themselves very well off; they all wished the line completed as soon as possible, and it was therefore important that proper steps s shouldbe takento avoidunnecessarydelay. They were aware -of the tightness of the money-market, and there might be some difficulty in forcing the North-Western Company to complete the line. The object of this meeting was to ramse funds, to authorize some competent person to watch the progress of the bill through Parliament, and see that the powers of the Shrewsbury and Crewe Act were not deviated from more than was necessary. He concluded by proposing a resolution to the effect that the meeting regretted to learn that it was the intention of the Londonand Naorth-Western Railway Company to apply to Parliament for an extension of time for making the Crewe a>nd Slirewabur branch ; and, as the time originally granted by Parliament was amply sufficient to enable the company to complete the railwvay within the time limited, it was the opinion of the meeting that a petition be presented to Parliament against any extension of timne being granted. Mr. GEORGE Bow r seconded the resolution, and it was adopted, as was also one nominating a conmaittee to collect subscriptions, and appointing a solicitor to conduct the opposition to the biUl on behalf of the toivn and neighboeurhoed of Wlhitchurch. The Cmun.iuLs said that if the company would commence the works without delay, and complete the line by the tinme prescribed by the act, he felt sure no obstacle would be offered by that meeting to their having anotlher year, so as to effect a dev-iation attho Shrewsbury end of the line. M1r. H. J. BA.RKER stated that the town of Wem was unanimous in its determination to resist the bill, and to effect that object a liberal sum had been subscribed. With some trifling exceptions, the company had paid for the la;nd between Crcewe and WVemn, and, If they did not make the line, it wouldbe an act of great injustice to the landowners and others resident in the district. The proceedings terminated with avote of thanks to the chairman. Similar meetinas to the above were held at Wem on Thursday, and at0antaich (Cheshire) on Saturday. LEOMINSTER AND KGTON. The directors of this company have not only contractea with Messrs. Brassey and Field for the construction of this line, which is now rapidly proceeding,but have also entered into a working agreement for a term of six years from nest July. Under the agreement the railway will be managed by Messrs. Brassey and Field, who are to pay all the working expenses, interest on loans, and a clear dividend of 4 per cent. upon the share capital to the shareholders. In order to complete the share capital the directors have made arrangements for issuingthe remainder of it uponterms which, they state, wil insure a regular return of 4 per cent. per annum from the actual time of payment to the conclusion f Messrs. Brassey and Field's contract, when they expect that a higher rate after its termination will be available from the development of the traffic. ISLE OF WIGHT STEAM BRIDGE. A public meeting was held at Ryde on Tuesday for the turpose of considerin the merits of the proposed steam ridge. The objects were explained to the meeting by the directors, Messrs. Fleming, Webster, Barrow, MLD., and Simpson. They stated that it was intended to make a short extension railway from Gosport to Stokes-bay, off Anglesea, where a pier would ran out into deep water to accommodate steamers at aU times of tide, with a view to supersede the present necessity of a chan-e of conveyance between the sport and Portsmouth italiway stations and the steam=cats. Betw-een this pier and Ryde a floatingbridge is to traverse a distance of three. miles (iDstead of the present route between Gosport and Ryde of five mies and a half) in about 20 minutes, at half-hour intervals, with passengers, goods, and cattle, so as to work in with the London trains, and thereby reduce the time of the journey between London and Ryde from four hours and a half, as at present, to three hours. Facilities are to be given to enable horses and carts or waggons to drive on and off the floating bridge by means of a miovable stage, which will land and embark them at a0l times of tide at the Ryde esplanade. It is expected that the traffic will be considerable, as the present Hyde Pier pays, in dividends sand bonuses, 15 per cent. The propsed amount of capital for the bridge is 20,0007. It was also intended to establish a line of steamers between Stokes-bay-uier and Havre', with a view to shorten the journey between London and Havre by two hours in time, and also the sea passage by 18 miles between the Southampton Railway station and the steamers. Resolutions were unanimously adopted in- favour of the Stokes-bay lRailway, pier, and Me of Vight Steama bridge, and acommittee was appointed to co-operate with the dircators in carrying outthese undertakings.

We liave had since last Saturday several frosty days, hart no reilly inclement weather.

Onthe whole, we are getting over winter renmirkably well; outdoorfarming operations hiave never been entirely stopped hut once for two or three days, and everybody has had ample opportunity of completing Jris tiUlage processes in the most satisfactory mianner. Nlotwithrstanding the great indisposition which exists among holders3 of wheat, especialy the growers, to admit the prospect of, an early termination of hostilities, the belief in its probability steadil gains ground ;henoe, in somecases, wheat has been brought fonr-ardliberar7y in the face of declining prices but in the greatmajority of instances our markets have either been scantily supplied or brought to a Standstill, from the unwillingness of holders to part with their stocks on thIs terms offered.

The inactivity which pervaded Wednesday and Fridays mabt at Mlark-lane led the icaimen this miorning to begin business by offering dealers and farmers much lower temas than last week. No dispDsition for a long while was evinced by the latter to, take the primas tendered, but, the meies not being anribuLs to-have large stocks, now that the dlour-market is in a very precarious state,. would not buy but at less money, holders feelingthe danger of k-eeping their wrheat on hand, yielded to the mealmen, and a fair clearance was made at a reductiont of Is, to 25. per quarter from. our last quotations.

LOND OY, MONDA Y, PEER UA1Y 4, *1sM. At a mnoment when an honourable peace is likely to be dearer than - ever, and when we have been made to feel the momentous significance that fiay attach to the merest trifle, our readers will miot hear without concern the first overt act of the American quarrel. The Executive of the United :..States has internal as well as external difficnlties - - to encounter, the former not so muchf of its own -maldng as the latter, and considerably more urgent. It fact, it appears that the whole machine 'of the Legislature has been brought to a dead Sloec, and that a state of things exist sufficiently aTrmiiing to: a patriotic and senseble citizen, yet - ofering a decided opportunity to a dashing and xeckless statesmanship. It is not for us to say low knots of this sort ought to be untied. When *nything of the kind happens in our own Parli&- mont-and it has happened mere than once in the prtne M eAers tlon-the good sense of the country is rure to speakout, andnotin vain. Thetruthis, that in this country factions, strong as they are, do not constitute the whole of' the comtninity; but from the Court to the peasant there are nunberless persons and institutions independent of party, andl averseto its excesses. It.isevidently far otherwise in America. A social tyranny there compels almost every man to choose his side, and to act his part, if he does not alwaysfeel it. So, when the sides are struck, and the actors told off, there reman no moderators of the controversy, no umpires of the strife, scarce, indeed, a dispassionate spectator of the scene. From the tenour of the recent intelligence from the States, it is plain that the PRsmsuID is as much absorbed in one of the parties now dividing the House of Representatives as the merest placuman in our own House of Commons, and he has been compelled to give his fiends such desperate aid as could be expected from an act of annoyance to this country. Every day we expect to hear that our Minister at Washington hss received his passports and is on his way home. That, of course, will compel a similar pro. ceeding on our part with regard to the American Minister, and Mr. CBAwToN and Mr. BucnAwA?, the two inoffensive gentlemen representing their Governments at Washington and London, will pro. bably cross each other on the Atlantic. -- Happily, the relations between the two countries do not 7wholly depend on these two gentlemen; and we kmow by European experience that it is possible for two States to go on as well-indeed, it has been maliciously asserted better-without diplomatic representatives. A channel can always be found for any communication one Government may wish to make to another. It is possible, then, the only result of this misunderstanding wil be that for some timo we shall onlyhave one Englishman the more and one American the less among us. We would very much rather it were otherwise ; but, as England has really apologized enough to satisfy ten European emnpires, we cannot hold her responsible for the estrangement. There are people whom it is impossible to quarrel with, and. there are people with whom the impossibility is of the contrary sort; and, if the United States refuse to be pacified with the ample satisfaction already rendered, we must put them down in the latter of these classes. We can honestly declare our entire belief that in ali England there is not one reasonable man who would desire to see the ti*ed States insulted or lowered in the eyes of the world by being compelled to any act of self-abasement. It would be felt that the disgrace recoiled upon those who had compelled it, and that if we had compelled it there would have been somethingD unnatural in the exigence of our pride. Surely there must be many iu the States who are still so much like Englishmen as to have the same feeling for those from whom they have sprung? To the world at large the difference between an Englishman and an American is not so considerable, we may even say, as our national vanity might suggest. The son is thought not so very unlike the parent; and when they fall out our enemies only say it is the. same arrogant temper developed in two different relations. In this instance the parent has shown a more than common anxiety not to shock mankind with the spectacle of a domestic quarrel. We have made apologies to our flesh and blood such as no earthly power could have extorted from us. But there are limits beyond which no consideration whatever should carry us, seeing that it is the duty of every State, as of every individual, to preserve its self-respect, which is, in fact, its moral existence. The British Government has only to ask the people whether they wish it to make more satisfaction to the Government of the United States than one gentleman makes to another, and the answer wiR be the same, quite as strong, and quite as unanimous, as when that people were lately asked whether they would allow Russia to extinguish our ally in the East. There is too much reason to fear that the powerful empire just brought to reason in the Old World put a false construction on the reluctance of the Western Powers to go towar. We have evenbeen ourselves accused of fostering her delusion. It is necessary, therefore, to guard against that mistake. Ve are perfectly awrra, none more so, of the extreme loss, difficulty, and risk of such a war as a class of Republiecan zealots are endeavouring to force upon us. We are aware that we should at once interrupt the most valuable portion of our commerce and manufactures, and that our merchants would find a foe, as well as a rival, in every part of the world. We are aware that we should have to deal with an enemy inheriting all our enterprise and daring, but not burdened, as we are, by a national debt and a hoMt of incapables, or trammelled by a Court, an aristocracy, and the routine, of which the Report from the Crimea we publish elsewhere discloses such sadly fantastic examples. We do not forget how quickly the United States raised the armies that I reduced Mexico and wrested from her whole provinces. We knowv that twenty-five millions of men of European, and chiefly British blood, are not to be despised. We could hardly expect to suffer much less damage than we could inflict. Nevertheless, we have not the least doubt in the world thaat the British people, even with all this put before them, would rather go to war at once than submit to national degradation. They would rather see their manufactories shut up, their machinery rust, and their ships rot in port, than require Government to render to any foreign Power a more humbling apology than the occasion required. The Americans must therefore reckon on an obstinate resistance, if they drive us to it. Let them count the cost before they take any fatal steps, else, after two or three years, they willmake tne calculation in vain. The British people are very slow to go to war, but they are still slower to make peace, and will never make a dishonour3ble one.
A dinner given by the East India Company, though always a very sumptuous, is not often a very lively affiir. The mind will revert in the midst of all the splendours of the scene to the poor Ryot, with his single cotton cloth for cover, toiling with ill-requited industry for the barest and most miserable existence. One thinks of theroads and bridges, the schools and the tanks, which the mnillio represented by the five lacs of rupees annually expended on the hospitality of Leadenhall-street might produce, and speculates whether they be as well spent as they are dearly earned. But on two recent occasions the festivities of the East India Company have been as appropriate as they have been splendid. On the first of these Lord CA?wro on his departure for 7ndia took leave of his friends and well-wishers in a speech the earnest and impressive tone of which remains indelibly fixed on the minds of those who heard it; and on the second, which took place on Saturday evening, Lieutenant-Generil Sir PATs=cx G3N&w! was entertained with more: than usual magnificence on his departure to asme atn office never before held by a servant of the East India Company-the Command in Chief of the Anny of the Presidency of Mad. To persons not in the habit of considering and a alloving for the narrow prejudices which have taken such fim hold of the chiefs of the English army it must seem incredible that a claim just i 4 mioderat as tt pRUt fOrtl, OIL behnlf of fthe Indian aimy to share in Indian comrmancd should havev been aolong--delayed .aid so irluctantly granted. We regret that the Commanderin-Chief was -not there to give by his presence a hearty and gracious sanction to this long-delayed act of justice, and;that neither the SXEoRLTARY of WAi nor any one to represent hin mingled his congratulations on so auspicious an occasion. MTr. VEBRoN Sanu attended to receive the thanks which his conduct in disregarding so many prejudices, aud overcoming so many obstacles had-well deserved, and the Duke of A:Gaax, as representing the Ministry, paid a hearty tribute to tho merits and exploits of our Indian army. But . it matters little what degree of support from rank and power the. principle of equal justice received; public opinion unequivocally ratifies the act, and proclaims that the time is rapidly passing away when such invidious distinctions can be tolerated between two services which, if not identical, can at any rate be made equaL It is indeed very difficult to imagine upon what excuse the exclusion of the Company's service from Indian coTnmands can be defended. We have not shown ourselves solicitous about providing extraordinary qualifications in those whom we intrust with our great Indian commands, for we have generally selected them from men in the last stage of decrepitude, or from soldiers in lttle more than the amne. That these .1ighty trusts should be reposed in such feeble hands had nothing in it repulsive to the notions that prevailed at the Horse Guards, provided they were the hands of men who had duly attained their ran;k in British or colonial service. It was enough for the Indian warrior that he had in the day of battle to lead Asiatic instead of English troops into action, and to be exposed, in addition to the perils of the field, so greatly increased by the quality of the troops he lcd, to the effects of an unhealthy and enervating climate, and that in actual war, when the necessity of things required the most sldlftl commander,he might be allowed to command a brigade, or even a division, consisting partly of English troops and Qumes officers. He might attain knighthood, or at least a Companionship of the Bath, but he must not carry his views beyond such objects of ambition, nor hope that any circumstances could raise him to the command of those great armies whose structure he had studied and whose divisions he had led. This exclusion has at anyrate been broken down, and we believe it would have been impossible to select a worthier officer in whose case to make the precedent of the change than Sir PATmas GRAiT, the well-known Chief of the Staff of Lord Gouon's armies, and the careful and provident director of several hard-fought but successful campaigns. With soldierlike frankness and cordiality, Sir PATBICK Gn&N.T acknowledged the honour that had been done to the service and to himself, and then. turned with a hearty and genuine attachment, which had in it much of affectionate simplicity, to his venerable leader, Lord GouGu, who, owing, as he himself truly said, his rank and his honours to the Indian Army, lent the prestige of his name to a festival intended to commemorate an event which many less brave and distinguished soldiers regard as lowering the dignity of the Royal army. We have never been among those who believed it possible absolutely to amalgamrate the Indian and European forces of the British CRowN. Sa long as the pay and allowances of the officers of the East India Company shall continue so much larger in amount than those of the officers of the Line we do not believe that such an union, however desirable, could possibly be achieved. The officer, too, who is to command native troops must, if he is to discharge his duty effectually, possess a knowledge of the language, the manners, and the customs of his soldiers, such as can 6ily be attained by long residence among Indian races and by a training particularly directed to this very object. We must be content, we fear, to forego the advantage of enrolling the Indian officers among our own. The distinction -between the two services is not articial, but natural, and no good purpose can be gained by striving to destroy it. But there is no necessity for following that distinction further than it naturaUly leads us. The reason why the English officer is unfit for the command of Sepoys does not apply to those grades of the service which are above the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. What sound reason can be given why Indian Generals should not be allowed, not merely an equality in Indian commands, but in all other Staff appointments, with the officers of the E'uropean army? We find difficullty enough in procuring Generals only ordinarily qualified for the management of great affairs; what paltry prejudice is it to exclude from our choice men accustomed to deel with armies on a scale far grander than anything which in England we are in the habit of witnessing ! Those who resisted this change were probably wise in their generation, for it certainly cannot be the last, and can only be regarded as a step towards the participation by the Indian army in other high commands besides those of the three Presidencies.
It appears to be received as a naxim in the social arrangements of this countrythat the winter season shall be devoted to the solution of puzzling riddles. Sheets full of perplexity are everywhere on sale about Christmas for the benefit of the younger members of tho community. In this, as in most other respects, children are but the apes of their seniors. The drawing-room, with its eager young faces gathered round the bright fire, is but a preparation for the " serious " business" of life. The Exchequer Chamber on F'iiday last was but the reproduction of such a scene. The guessing party consisted of six of the superior Judges, and they sat for some hours in seriouls deliberation upoii the solution of a question which to men of non-legal mind appears as full of difficilty as the most carefully-devised riddle which was ever concocted as a touchstone of Juvenile acuteness. This was the point .-During the Cambridge election one RicHAD CATRR, a voter, received a circular from the comnnittee of LOrd MUSxTOcNE and Mr. SLAE, stating that if he came to vote his railway fare would be paid for himi. Is the payment of travelling expenses legal ? There is a judgment of the late Chief Justice Trslv which would appear to establish the fact that it is so. MIr. SLADE, a Queen's Counsel himself, relying upon this judgment, decided that the travelling expenses of a voter might be paid, and accordingly the sum of 8s. was handed to RicHAP.D CanTr for this purpose. There was no question of corrupt intention. When the case was tried before Mr. Baron PAMKE, that learned Judge directed the jury to find for the plaintiff if they were satisfied that money was paid to CAUnMn in order to induce hini to vote for Mr. SLADE, even if the money paid was only for railway fare. In a subsequent portion of his charge the Judge intimated to the jury that they must find for the plaintiff, although the defendant really believedthat he was not committing any offence, 'if satisfied upon the evidence that the defendaut "did give money fo CA&Tm on account of the "railway fare, and that the moving cause of "his giving the- money was his voting for cthe defendant." The plain English of all this is that, in Baron- P?Axes opinion, it is contrary to the law that a, candidate at an election ahould pay the travelling expenses of his votenu. The jP!7 found in accordance with the direction of the Judga. To his ruling there w 1a d exceplona, aua the result wam that .......~. . ...... . . h e was brought l web1 Vefre_the ExcheVhuer Chamber for.koro iaddeciion. In ourimpressibn of Saturday will be found a column of closely-printed matter, contang the report of a score or two -of imagnary cases put by the Bar to the Bench, and the Bench to the Bar. It was the Saturnalia of guessers. The question. alose under the 17th and 18th of VicroarA, chap. 102, which enacted that various heads of expense therein enumerated were illegal; but nothing -was said abott travelling expensei. "Is there "'anything nmmoral or illegal in paying the railway "fare of a voter ?" said MIr. KwowLns. " To treat "a witness is not illegal," answered Mr. Justice asssELL Bso there was an end of that. " May "Itake a voter in my oDWn carriage ?' continued the pertinacious MIr. KNOwls. BMron AaDEasoN, in a facete manner, replied-" Supposing you take a "cspecial train, and you take every man who " cormes and wnks with the left eye, but not "if he wiiri on both sides?" Mr. KNoWr.Es was still unabashed; he begged of their Lordships to inform him if he might present a voter who had polled for him with a brace of pheasants. Mr. Baron MAxTrn haa hin case, and Mr. Baron BR mwmax had his case-and so, among all these worshipful peopla; the fun ran fast and furious, till, at the cvnclusion of the proceedings, Mr. Baron ALDEBBSOmI with sing7ular good sense, remarked, ,I'Tis a great pity the Legisla" ture has not determined the point." That is, in point of fact, the sum and substance of all that can be said with any truth about the matter. A man need not be one of the Judges of the superior courts, or one of the Queen's Counsel, to state twenty excellent reasons why, as a mere matter of legal constraction and logical inference, either rside should prevail. The question is one of policy, not of law, and, if there is to be a restriction at all, it should be imposed by the act of the Legis. lattre, not by a decision of the Judges. It is obvious enough that the payment of a railway fare could never act as an inducement upon a voter's mincd to make him vote for A rather than for B. If he be a poor man, he is at least his day's work out of pocket, and has the trouble besides, and all with no other advantage to himself than that of a facility for registering his vote. On the other hand, if it be legal for a candidate to pay the travelling expenses of his voters, in large and scattered constituencies the longer purse wiiU prevaiL The rich candidate will be able to bring up his voters, wvhile his poorer rival must be content to do without the votes of many constituents who woulld gladly give him thoir support, but who are unable to afford the expense of the journey. If, therefore, the Legislature is to show itself squeamish in such a matter, the almost unlimited multiplication of polling-places is the obvious corollary to the restriction. TEhe pollingbox like justice, must be brought to every man's door. | The caso has considerable importance at the pre- sent moment from the irainence of the Cambridge U niversity election. There are not in the British Ildes any constituencies so widely diffused as those of the two Universities. The voters are to be found scattered about every part of the Qmmni's dominions. As clergymen, as lawyers, as physicians, as country gentlemen, as idlers, the graduates of these two learned corporations are to be met with in every county, and too many of them are in a situation in which the expenditure of 51. is a matter of very serious consideration. Surely, no one will pretend that the vote of a member of either I University is to be corruptly obtained by payment of the voter's travelling expenses. This we say as applicable to the particular case, and not as relevant to the general rule of law, which must, no doubt, be promulgated by the Judges upon wider grounds. The case, however, with regard to the Cambridge University election appears to stand thus :-Mr. WALPOLE is prepared to pay the travelling expenses of his voters; MIr. DEN3rAw declines to do so. If Mr. WAoeLo be in the right, of course he will have added considerably to his chance of success ; if he be in the wrong, some very unpleasant consequences may accrue to his supporters, as well as to himself.
There are few documents that contain more interesting matter than the periodical rcturns of the REGIsTT -GsmRAL with regard to public health. "Tell me what a man eats, and. rl tell you what "he is," says BaLTAT-SA'vAaRW. Tell us how a nation dies, and we can equally tell how it lives. The health of a country is one of the suest tests of. its eiviliation, and when we hear individuals denouncming modem civilization for the physical wealness which it entails we can only answer that they are speaking in ignorance of the facts. If our civilization be of this spurious kind, then our -most crowded city ought to be one of the unhealthiest. On the contrary, it stands high in point of salubrity, and every year it is becoming more and more healthy. We lately called attention to a statement in the REGisTRAs's report which testified. to the benefits of the purer water now supplied to the greater part of the metropolis. In the last weekdy return there was another statement, which refers to a much narrower district, but is not the less satisfactory to sanitary reformers, and especially to those who have been seeling o improve the dwellings of the lower classes. Many of our readers will remember Wild-court and the facts which we brought to their notice last year as to its fearful mortality. Let them now read the following extract from the REGISTRtiR S report :- " r. Faulkner, the registrar of the South sub.district of St. Giles', records two deaths in Wild-court, which he calls can unusual occurrence' now in that locality. He attributes the remarkable diminution of mortality to sanitary improvements effected in the court. Wild-court (tho Re. gistrar adds), 'from being the worst, is now the best court in my district, and is a striking proof how much the health of a neighbourhood may be improved by attention to deanli- i ness and comfort."' Here is great encouragement for those who are engaged. in the noble work of ministering to the' health and comfort of those who are too ignorant or too dispirited to attend to their own wants. Here are no gigantic works to be undertaken, that require acts of' Parliament to sanction them, enormous sums and many years to complete them. It is a small district in which two deaths are now " an unusual occurrence," in which the effects of ventilation and cleanliness are perceptible in a few months, and are attained at a comparatively trifling cost. Yet it is the sum of these small districts that makes up the great metropolis, and there is, after all, no way in which we can so unmistakeably benefit the poor as in providing them with cleanly and. comfortable abodes. We are doing all that we can to diminish the amount of crime by ragged schools, reformatory institntions, and other-benevolent schemes; and in promoting the health, and clealiness, and comfort of the poor man's dwelling,-.i malding it, if not a home, at least habitable-for nothing but the temper of the inmates can make it truly "a, home,"-we diminish the crime as well as the mortality of the metropolis. The two go together; excess of danger -prodrices excessive recklessness, and it is to be hoped that the remarkable cure which bas been effected in Wild-court will act as an example in other districts, and be a premium on cleanliness and aJl that follows in its train of health of body and health of mind.

The Moniteur of yesterday republishes the officiil announcement of the adhesion of Russia to the Austrian proposals, with the observation that there were some errors in the first version, publishecd in Saturday'sMomiteir. The following is the corrected version:- "Russia has adhered to the five propositions wnhch are to serve as the preliminaries of peace, and which were presented for her acceptance by Austria, with the assent of France and Engiand. This unreserved adhesion was announeed in a note addressed by Count Nesselrode, the Russian Chancellor, to Count Esterhazy, the Austrianu Minister at St. Petersburg, and in a despatch communicate& to Count Buol by Prince Gortschakoff, the Russian Minister at Vienna. The Russian Government, in consequence, proposed the signature of a protocol at Vienna, to enreaister the adhesion of the contracting Courts to the propositions intended to serve as the bases of negotiation, and to declare that plenipotentiaries shall meet at Paris within three weeks (or sooner, if possible), in order to proceed successively to the signature of prelimaries, to the conclusion of an arTnistice, and to the opening of general negotiations. " The British Government had already expressed a desire that the conferences should be held at Paris, and the Austrian Gover-nment having, on its side, eagerly acceded to that suggestion, it is therefore in the capital of the empire that the plenipotentiaries who may be appointed to deliberate on the conditions of peace will assemble. The protocol setting forth the acceptance of all the parties was signed yesterday (Friday) at ViLenna, at noon, and it was decided that the plenipotentiaries of the Powers who are to take part in the negotiations shall assemble at Paris before the 20th of February." We may add, that the armistice, when it has been agreed on, will extend to the 31st of March.
P)INCBSS'S THEATRE. The revival of tho Merchant of Venice at this house has been attended with remarlable success. Four years had elapsed since it was last played there, and the reappearance of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Eeau in their once familiar chartaers of Shylock and Portia has been heartily greeted sith something of a feeling of curiosity. Plays have their varying fortunes as well as everything else, and time has been when tho Mcrchant of Venicc was, at once, one of the most hackneyed works and one of the least attractive in the ordinary Shakspearian repertory. Its position in this respect is now completely changed. Raving remained unacted for a considerable period at the West end of London, it has a charm akin to that of novelty, especisly when its revival is signalized by the performance of both the leading chanacters by artists of the highest rank, and is not, as on some occasions, treated as a " star-play" for Shylock alone. Mr. Charles Keen's impersonation of the Jew requires a mnost careful observation to appreciate all its merits, founded as it is on a cception totallydfferent fromthatwhich v,ouia occur to an actor who would make of the part an occasion for vulgar display. The common way of interpreting Shy. lock is to treat him asthe incarnation of an intensemalignity, which is ready to burst forth at every pore, and which vents itself in a number of strong "points." Mr. Kean, on the eontrary,hohasnowlongoeasedtr regard" pointmaking"- as the chief glory of histrionic art, makes his whole interpretation a comment on the words :-" Rath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?' Ho would demonstrite the human attributes of Shylock, and therefore ever keeps dowvn his more obvious malignity, while hya skilful uso of certain passages he alows us to surmise that under more unfavourable circumnstances he rnight have been at least as good a man as his Christian reviler. Thus, though he makes Shylock surly and suspicious in the first scene, he lays no strong emphasis on his evil intentions and, though he has the feeling of vindictiveness' that is natural to a Venetian of any persuasion wio has been spurned and spit upon, we may almost imagine that, had it not been for the additional rron" inflicted upon him by the abduction of Jessica, he would-have been less ri"orous in the enforcement of his "merry bond." Yt is from the delivery of the speech partally cited above that we gain the key to Mr. Kean's conception. When ho has enumerated his wrongs, and accounts for them by the simple exclamation, "I am a Jew!" he utters the words more in sorrow than in anger, ana then he goes through the series of argamentative interrogations in the tone of rational expoastulation till he comes to the word "revenge," when herejoices tojustifythe exerciseofthepowervithinhMs grasp. Sothoroughly,indeed,hashe conveyed theaimpression that his maignity is to be attributed less to the workings of an evil nature than to a long course of unjust persecution, which reaches its climax in fiial inratitude, that when he says, "No ill luck stirrin but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my breathmg; no tears hut o' my shedding,"-and his eyes are tearful in reality,-he becomes an object of compassion, and we attribute the remarkable words, " The curse never fel upon our nation till now; I never felt it tUl now," not to a sort of comical selfishness, but to that intensity of sorrow that seems to diffuse individual suffering over an entire world. A fine touch of pathos, too, is given to the words, "Thou torturest me, Tubal; it was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor." The old commentators on Shaklpeare, not suspecting that Shylock had a heart, but supposng that he had only an innate desire to cut the flesh off his neighbour's, accounted for the great respect in which he held this same turquoise by referring to the imaginary virtues formerly ascribed to the stone, sagely observng that, as he had been married long enough to have a daughter grownup he did not prize it an consideration of its money value. at a different significceisput uponthesentence bythe intonation of ;Mr. C. KeanYI The rin comes upon his mid as an early love-gift from Jessica's mother, now dead, at the very inoment when he is smarting under the discovery that he has not only been deserted but robbed by Jessica herself. Even after all the action of the trial scene has been gone through and the vindictive propensities of Shylock have received their full development, his donfa, expressed as it is by Mr. lKean, almost excites our commiseration, and-we certainly sympathize with him more than with the garrulous Gratiano, who is so ready to exult over a fallen enemy. The countenance does not denote convicted villany, buta sense cf hopelessness, as if the man felt that he had no longer any vocation in this world, but was a doomed being, to whom the laws of his country availed nothing. This interpretation of Shylock, which does not make of him an object of unmitigated aversion, but elicits from the whale play a lesson of tolerance rather than an aliment for preudce,isrealyupprtd blWs.CaresR;ean's zting of PorEin he ria sone.The lines in wshich she represents to him that thrice the principal of his bond is offered hm, and which might bemade merelyargumentative, areuttered in a tone of kind persuasiveness, that svuld enote a sympathy with ShylocX althouh she- has come to save Antonio. She knows that she can crush him as soon as she dravs forth her stack of legal arguments, but, consistently with her previous eulogyof mrcy, she almost bes the Jew to escape the doom which is impending over his head. For Antomo no suchauxiety is needed, as she already knows, although the other characters do not, that he is perfectly safe. She thus becomes the ideal impersonation of that broad human sympathy which must be regarded as the moral basis of the whole play, notwithstanding the apparnt discrepancies that result from the prejudices of tho age in which it was written. Indeed; through the excellence of Mrs. - Kean's- Portia- -the, play is interesting throughout, instead of rivetting the attention by isolated situations and relaxing its hold in th intervals betweenthem. Thus tho scene in which Bassaniomakes his choice among the caskets is rendered one of the most striking of all'by the mere play of countenance with which mrs. Kean watches the proceeding. Not a word is uttered in this situation, but the look of painful anxiety that comies over her face whenever her suitor takes up a wrong casket, and the team of hope that gently revesls itself as each misleading bait is avoided, show that-the happinessof a lifeis at stakeintheotrious venture, though a reigious. restralat is imposedon the utterance of every feeling.. To those who are acquainted with the ply in the original form only, it may be necessary to explain that: in the acting version the Plinces of Morocco and Arragori are emitted, and that the interest they awaken by their successive failures is transferred to Bassanio, who takes up- all the caskets, though he only opens one, It is during the speech whichiattends his comparison of the boxes ar;d their inscriptions that that chaige of einotion takes lace in Portia which is so exquiitely delineated by Mrs . & Rean.

The Nord publishes the following telegraphic despatch, dated fron Vienna, Satuiday night "When signing, the protocel yesterday, Price Gortschbaloff requested that rrsia should bo in. vited to take part in the Conferences. Count Bjaol supported the request. "The French and English Thisterstook no-t-e of it ai referendum." EXPRESS FROM PARIS..' The following is the letter of our Ptaris coerespondent; dated yesterday, 6 pm.- - A telegraphic despatch received last night fronm Constantinople announcesthat the person named to perform the duties of Plenipotentiary at the Paris Conferences is Aali Pasha, the Grand Vizier. He leaves Constantinople on the 6th, and wMill probably arrive at Marseilles the 16th or 17th-quite time enoughtobein Paris on the 20th. Thisnomination appears to give satisfaction to the Govermment. Aali Pasha is considered as one of the best, if not the best, of the political men of his country. He is said to be more familiarly acquainted with European politics than any of his contemporaries, not even excepting Redschid Pasha s ho is intelligent and acute, of a serious character, capable of muck appli. cation, and an excellent man of business. I do:lot know whether on any of these grounds there exisfed an objection to Redschid Pasha, but the fact of his son being Ambassador here is considered sufficient to justify his exclusion. Though the 20th is the day named for the opening of the Conferences, yet it is believed that business willnotreallycqmmence til the 24thor25th. It has been stated that the sittings of the Plenipotentiaries will be held in the Palace of the EIys6e; such is not the case; they will be conducted at the 3inistry of Foreign Affar The hotel is one of the fiuest buildings in Paris; the saloons are spacious and coramodious, and beautifully furnihed; but were it not so no other place could be so appropriate. The Plenipotentiaries for Russia are still supposed to be MM1. Orloff and Brunow, but I have some reason to believe that no official intelligence of their nomiination has as yet been received here. The names of both were put forward some weeks ago by ML de Nesselrode, and nothing has been said since which would imply a change in the selection. The period of the labours of the Plenipotentiaries has been variously stated at from 10 or 12 days to three months. France, England, and Austria are certainly anxious to get through the business without any unnecessary delay; and in well-informed quarters it is thought probable that within a month, at the utmost, from the day of opening they will be brought to a conclusion. All that is vague will be arranged in the preliminaries. AIlndion has been made to war indemnities. I am assured that the question has not been mooted, and very probably will not-at all events by this Government or Austria. The fortifying of the Aland Isles is among the questions that will be taken into consideration at the Conferences. Prussia is making, every exertion to be admitted. As I have already said, no proposition has been made to her, norlhas she made any to France or En'gand directly; it is through Austria she hopes to have her Plenipotentiaries also in Paris. If she be admitted it can only be on condition of accepting all that the alies have done up to the present moment. Her non-participation in the preliminaries of peace does not imply her exclusion from thenegotiations. But on heradmission to either nothing has, I am assured, been decided. The origina protocol, as signed at Vienna, has not yetbeen receivedhere: it is expectedto-morroi. The Government is not in favour of giving publicity to this or any other inportant document connected with the Conferences, until the negotiations are at an end. If, however, the English Cabinet feels obliged to communicate those papers to Parliament, there will be no alternative but to publish thera here also. it is of little use to indulge in speculations as to the issue of the Conferences. The general opinion, as also the wish, is that it will be satisfactory. I can see, however, that a few doubt it, but no more reasons than those I have already noticed can ba shown for arriving at either conclusion. The symptoms observed for the last few days we said to be favourable to peace. It would be premature to offer any conjectures on that point; yet there are *ome who think that if too much importance be not given to mere matters of form, or too great a determination shown in affixing too clearly the stamp of humiliation on Russia, the substance of our demands is safe. Russia, however she may not be able to conceal from Europe the loss of her piesigc, will have to put the best face she can on her situation with her own people, and the allies may feel disposed not to press her too hardly on this point. With all this you wil not be surprised to learn that there are still persons who do not believe in the sincerity of Russia, but who think that she will employ her usual craft in sowing dissension between the allies. On this as on other mnatters time only can decide. In my letter of Friday I gave some notion of the effect produced on the public generaly, and on the representatives of foreign States in particular, by the speech from the Throtie on the opening of the English Parliament. I have to observe that in certain quarters it is remarked that there wvas no allnsion to the visit of the Queen to Paris, to which so much political importance was attached; and that the aliance between England and France, an event not less important, was not noticed as it might have been, or perhaps was expected to be. Those with whom that alliance is not popular point with satisfaction to the omission.

This is the longest period allowed by law after the receipt of the writ; but, in consequenCe of net Tuesday and Wednesday being Shrove Taesday and AhWednesday, itwas thought better, in deference to the Cathedral authorities, that tho eection should not take place on thcee day. lBoth tho candidates, Mr. Bodkin and Mr. W.

The formergentleman has received a good deal of additional support among the Deople of Rochester on account of his havng declined the office of Assistant-Judge at the Middlesex Sessions, which would have disqualHifed him from sitting in Parliament. and continued his pretensions to reporesentthescity of Rochester after the offer was made; and, if any credit is to'ce given to thestatements of his friends with regard to the numbher of promises of support ho has received, his election will be certain.

" MADPjD, Ist.-In the Cortes the discussion o03 the eleetoral bases is being proceeded with. The aazdte cogtains an article filled wvith praise of the Duke and Duchess dt Mot. pensier for tlleir charitable acts at Seville." IAletterfrom Jassy of the 29th uilt., inthe3l e1i teecr, says " The Moldavian people, who had shown such warm aud spoataneous enthusisam at the news of the takdng of Bebastopol, wero desirous of testifying in a still more CffeCtual mnnner their admiration of the allies and their sympathies for the cause which they su pport. Subscription lists werm opened throughout the whole of Moldavia in favour of the wounded, anda sum of 4,420 ducats (54,543 francs) had already been collected. MLT Negri and Balieti, the Molda'ian Ministers on a mission at Constantinople, have just received instructions to pay that smn into the bands of the French Ambassador in that capital." The.Queen's speech is the subiect of comnMent on the part of the Paris journals of this day, which unite in praising the firm though padeifi language of that addrsss. The reflections most worthy of reproductiorn are contained in the Si&Me and the ni?iOa. The Constitsdionnel is silent on the topic of the day. The Union expresses itself thus There is manifested tarough the tone cf proud dignity and calm haughtiness which is breathed in the speech of Queen Victoria an inward sentiment, wbich escapes in a reserved and cold manner, but which it is very important to point out and to analyze. The admirable and difficult saccess of the allied armies is noted with simplicity, vithoat emphasis, but also without great enthusiasm. The praise of the victors of Sebastopol, of France, of Sardinia, is sober and scanty. On the other hand, tho speech dilates, on the one side, on the miLtary preparations commenced with a view of giving additional vigour te the land and sea operations; on the other, it declares that these preparations ill not cease one instant, notwithstanding the hope of an approaching pacification. It is underthis clause, under the shadow of this prudent reserve, that the Queen approaches the sabject of the negotiations. Sheclearly aludes to the intervention and the good offices of tho Emperor of Austria, to the consent which shi has given, in concert with France, to these overtures, and she announces with satisfaction the acceptance of certain conditions on which she hopes may be based a general treaty of peace. With respect to these conditions the speech enters into no details. Is this language, so measured, so distant from a boundless confidence, a concession to public opinion? Does it express the true sentiments of the Cabinet ' At all events, it demands reflection." It next remarks on the absence of any allusion in the speech to the difficultieswith the United States, with Persia, and with the Neapolitan Government, as also to the late visit of King Victor Emmanuel to England, and it thus concludes:- "The speech of the Queen of England appears to us strongly impregnated vitha greater reserve than usuaL It possesses a calm majesty, which is not injured by this restrained finnness, but it betrays, even in the invocation to Providence with which it terminates, an attitude that cannot be depicted better than by the idea of thepoet:-' It is a roaring lion, which even in repose roars and is vigilant."' The SiEcle contains the following:- " The Queen of England announces that in pursuing the negotiations whliCht are about to open in Paris she will not lose sight of the aim with which the war was commenced, that she will not stop one moment her military preparations, until a satisfactory treaty is condluded. When the powerful Queen of Great Britain agrees in so brliliaut a manner with the policy which we permitted ourselves to advise, we shal be pardoned if -we hope that in the congress which is about to open the grand interests which we have defended wil not be abandoned. The Queen of England, like us, has not localized the war, and it is not without forethought that she quits the shores of the south of Europe, and occupies herself with the north, with the Baltic, and the Swedish treaty., . , . .Have we advised that conditionswhich couald not be accepted without dishonour should be imposed? No; a thousand times, no! Only grave acts of injustice have been committed by Russia, victorious. We demand, then, that these actsbe revised, for Fance and England can do it; and never were circumstances more favourable than now. Our preparations arermade and are being continued. ThesecondaryStates of Eurora accompany us wvith their sympathies. Let us have the conrage to revise that map of Europe which in 1815 was so shamefully drawn up against us, against civilization, of which tho nations of the West are the apostles and the representatives. England ancd France have declared that their desire was not to make conquests, that they fought for right and justice. Let, then, right bo vindicated and justice established. We wish not to incriminate the intentions of those who havo inconsiderately shown so much joy at the acceptance without reserve of Russia; but tho peace which they will obtain, unless it be guaranteed by the extension demanded by the state of Europe, will be but an appearance of peace, and a peace without a future. bloreover, the Queen of England is not isolated in her noble language to Parlinament. That body, the serious organ of public opinion, has responded to it by an address voted without opposition. All Rngland marches behind her Sovereign." It is said that a circular note has been addressed bytheCountdeChamnbordto his principalpartisans in Paris and the departments. Theyare earnestlyrecommendec by the Prince to contribute, so far as their means allow, for the relief of the working glasses furinu this rigorous season, when the necessaries of life are so dear. They are also requested to suggest to the organs of the Legitinist party the propriety of speaking in the highest tenns -of the bravery of the French army, and, indeed, to omit no occasion of rendering homage to it. They are also strongly advised to forget any dissension that may still sulbsist between the Orleanists and themselves; to promote a good understanding betlwleen the-partisans of the two branches; to iitate in every respect the union that has been effected between the Princes of the house of Bourbon, and to render the fusion between themr still more complete.

We publi!h tltl dity the firt report of Sir Johm 1IrNeill and CoIvxel Ttllocb, the commiWioners sent out last year by Lord Paumure to inquire into the tatte'of the armj in the Crimea.- The late hour at which the report has relied us prevents us from doing iaore t1bn to entreat the careful attention of our readers top the fats stated with judiialecalmness by the commrie¶aionem. They corroborate in every particular-where, indeed, they do not exceed in force of statersnt-the Jetters of our correspVwdesta; they utteAy dispxwe the cblarges of " exaggeration!" which Nave been " frequently and* so glbly made, amrs demonstrate, indeed, that no.language conld adeqmately desmibe, the sufferings of the army or the imbecizity to which; they may for the mostpart be traced "FIRST REPORT. "onstautinoplc, Jimcr, 1855. " My Lord,-We have the honour to report to, in pursuance of your Lordship's instructions, we set out from London on the 23d of February, and arrived at Ocustantinople on the 6th of Mlarch. We proceeded at once tolScutari, and, having visdted the Barrack and General llospitakh examinedthepurveyorandprincipal medicaloffcer. As-the conditiDn and arrangements of thDse hospitalshavebeer.the subjects of a sepate inquiry and report, we shall not trouble your Lordship with any details in regard to them. " The information which we obtainted at Scutari and at, Constantinople was of great inpoeetauce to our future; procedings. We ascertained that the sick arriving frorn the Crinea were nearly all suffering from diseases chiefly attnbutable tp diet, andtlkat the food supplied to the army during the winter, consisting princally of salt eat and biscuit, with a very insufficient proportion of vegetables, was calculated, in the circumstances in which the troops were placed, to:prodace those disease " It was, thereforc, evidently desirable to increase the supplies of fresh meat and vegetables, and to substitute fresh bread for biscuit. On this subject w;e Lad the advantage of a conversation witlh Dr. Sutherland, of the Sanitary Commission, who confirmed, from the results of his professionalinvestigtaions, the information we had obtained as to the causes of the prevailing diseases, and entirdy concurred in the necessity of substituting fresh lneat for salt, and fresh bread for bicuit, as well of increasing the supuly of fresh or preserved vegetables. Colonel Tuloch had acquired experience in such matters from having been chiefly hnstrmental in providing a supply of fresh bread for his regiment when stationed in tho ceded provinces after the first Burmese war, and, therefore, it was arrauged that he should direct his especial attention to that subject from the moment of our arrival in the Crimea. " We entered the harbou\ of Balaldava upon the 12th of March, and the follownng dayproceeded to head-quarters to wait upon Lord Raglan, and to arrange our proceedings in conducting the inquiry intrusted to us. The coumsc which weproposed to pursue was explained in the letter of the 13th of March, of which a copy is annexed; his Lordship's entire concurrence in that course is conveyedi to us in his letter of the 15th of March, of which a copy is also annexed; and on the following day we commenced the examination of the regimental officers stationed in the vicinity of Balaldava. " YoUowing out that course, we have seen and personaly examined, either separately or collectively, tho commuding officer, surgeon, and qnuartermaster of every corps in the Crimea, who was not prevented by ilness from attending; and from them havo obtained evidence of such deficiencies as have occurred in the supplies of each corps, and of the consequences of those deficiencies. We next examined the officers commanding brigades and divisions, with the exception of Sir George Brown, who was absent at Kertch; together vith the staff offlcers, the principal medical officers and the Commissariat officers attached to brigades aud divisions; finaly, we examined the Quartermaster-General, and the senior Assistant Quarterraster-. General, the Commnissary-General, and thetwo Deputy Comimissaries-General who are present with the army. The personaexamnatnon of the Quartermaster-General, however, having repeatedly been interrupted or prevented by his being cOaed upon to attend to more pressing duties, and finding ourselves uable from illness to postpone our departure till he should be sufficiemtly disengaged, a series. of written questions was sent to bim to be answered. " The notes of the examinations talcan down in presence of the witnesses, without the assistance of a shorthand writer, were in all cases subsequently sent to them for correction and signature. Printed queries were also addressed to the commalding officer and to the surgeon of each corps andthe answers returned were signed by them. These documents have not been subjected by us to any correction beyond what was necessary to rectify mere verbal errors or omissions obviouslyarising from inadvertence. It would havebeeneasytorelieve them of many repetitions, and otherwise to dress and polish them, without materiaUy alteringtheir import; but we have thought it better to submit them without erasing the rough original stamp of authenticity than to change in any respect the form in which they were returned to us, co-rected and signed by the witnesses. "It is a great satisfaction to us to find, on most of tho important points. a remarkable concurrence in the testimony as to matters of fact. " The sufferings of the army in the course of the winter, and especiaUy during the months of December and January, mnst have been intense. We have not noted all the particulars related to us, many of which were unconnected with our inquiry; but we may state that it has been only by slow degrees, ana- after the frequent repetition of similar details, as one witness after another revealed the facts that had come under his own observation, that we have been able toformanyadequate-conceptionof the distress andmiseryundergone bythe troops, or fullyto appreciate the unpallUeled courage and constancy with which they have enadured their sufferings. Great Britain has often had reason to be proud of her army, but it is doubtful whether the whole rangc of military history furnishes an example of an army exhibiting, throughiout a long campaign, qualities as high As havo distinguished the forces wader Dord RIaglan's command. The strength of the men gave way under excessive labour, watching, exposurc, and privation; but theynever murmured, their spirit never failed, and the enemy, though far outnumbering them, never detected in those whom he encountered any sign of wealmess. Their numbers were reduced by diseaso and by casualties to a handful of men, compared with the great cxtent of the lines which they constructed and defended; yet the army never abated its confidenice in itself, and never descended from its acknowledged military pro-eminence. " Both men and officers, when so reduced that they were hardly fit for the lighter duties of the camp, scorned to be excused the severe and perilous work of tLe trenches, lest they should throw an undne amount of duty upon their comarades; yet they maintainedevery foot of ground against all the efforts of the enemy, and with numbers so small that. perhaps, no other troop3 wou;ld even have madethe attempt. " Suffering and privation have frequently led to crime, in armieS as in other communities, but offences of a serious character have been nulmown in the British army in the Crimea. Not one capital offence has been committed, or even alleged to have been committed, by a soldier, and intemperance has been rare. "Every one who mnows anything of the constituxtion of the army must feel that, when troops so conduct thamselves throughout a long campaign, the officers must have done their duty, and zet the example. The conduct of the men, therefore, implies the highest encominm that can be passed upon their officers. They have not only shared all the danger and exposure, and most of the privations which the men had to undergo, but we everywhere found indications of their solicitude for the welfar- of those who were under their command, and of their constant readiness to employ their private means in promoting the comfort of their men. Doubtless, therehasbeen, astherealvays must be, better management in some regiments than in others, but among much that was painful in the evidenoe that we have heard it wns always grati6,ing to observe the comm unity of feelings and of interests tiat appeaed everywhere to subsist betweenthe men andtheir officors, and hlich the regimental system of the British army seems almost always to produce. ; -'We hope to be excused for venturing to offier these general observations upon the cnduct of The army. It was impossible to rerain from expressing, however inadequately, the admiration which a carefu iuvestigation Pf the circumstances cainot failto produce. "It was inevitable that the operations of a siege, cariecd on throughoutt te rinterin the Crimea, should involve a very considerable amount of hardship and sickness. These are consequences of such operations as certain as l losses in action when. abattle is fought.

"The evidence of the commendin, o9icers ana quarter- masters showed what indeed, vas admitted by the Cominis- ' sariat, that on several occasions,. especially in tha month of December, some of the diviious did not receive full rations. For the purpose of ascertainimg the-precists amount of these deficiencies retunis were caUled for freen achi corps, but in manyeases, owing. to the- difficulty experienced in keeping or preserving records of any kjrd, t!lh regimnental officerswere unable to vouch for the-accuracy oE thedetails. An abstractofthese retushas, however, Ween. printed in the Appendix. "It appears that in the Cavalry and ist. Divisions, acid in the 2d Brigade, 2nd Division, the deficiencie4 were merely fractional; and thateve` in-the'Thivd Divio andl the 1st Brigade, 2dDivision, vhere they were sonewhlat greater, they were not such as could, in ordincry circsxnstances, materially affect the health of the troops. - "In the 4th and Light Divisions the. deficiencies.iuthea rations were not only greater in amount, but also much more continuous. In those divisions the men. ware frequertly on three-quarters, tvo-thirds, andl sometimres tuL half rations of meat and of rum; on twov occas;ons they bad only quarter rations, and on one day they had- nonu at IL lE the other items the defalcations were not very important except in rice, of which the Fourth Division did not get any for the first 10 days in January, nor for thre other days in that mronth, whle- a brigado. of t3e Light Division received for six days in thatr mnth only half ther usual quantity. "fWith reference to the probable edhet. of such deficiencies, it may be proper to state that, prior to December, 1850, the ration of salt porlk, then issued twice a-week to the British troops On several foreign staftions was only l2oz., with 31b. of beef, fresh or salt, on tLe other five days, and that, prior to 1S37, the ration of pork was only 9DZ. on. three days in the week-, with 31b. of beef, fresh oc salt, oDt the other four days, -which is less than the average quantiy actually issued, even in those divisions in which the deficienciesweregreatest. On those stations, however, in addition to lb. of soft bread, the troops had at all times eitther 4oz. of rice or half-n-pinit of peas daily, besides vhich a portion of theirpaywasexpendedinpurehasingvegetsblesinthei market, whereas in tli3 Crimea5 during the greater pert or November and December, and also in a great measure during January and part of February, the soldier was confined exclusively to biscuit in addition to his salt meat. "The French troops, it is understood, had only 12c of beef, or lOoz. of pork daily, when salt meat was- issued; but, besides being always able to use their coffee and sugar with advantage, they had 2 1or of rice, or driedvegetabler, and 27oz. of soft bread, or 20oz. of biscuit daily. "In considering the probable effects of the deficiencies leferred to, it mnay be presumed, from the facts nbot-e stated, that it was not so much from default in the zations of -sat meat ard biscuit that the diet of the troops affected their healtlh, as from the insuffciency of other descripions -of food. At the same time there can be no douibt that tho short rationis were considered an additional iardsLhip and! privation by those who could use them, and that auy diminution in the nutritive value of the diet, which. even vhen issued in full, was, insufficient to maintain the strength of mnen undergoing hard labour and much exposure, must have been injurious to aS vi.o could have consumed it. bTany of the men, ho.ever, did not et the salt meat, especially the salt bee -when full rations were issued. The prevailing diseases were, at that tine, affeetions of the bowels, in most cases connected with scorbutic tendency in the system; and not only the men, but the medical officers also, believed that those diseases were aggravated, and that tendency increased, by . the continued use of, salt meat. In many cases, the arersiorL to that description of food seems to have amounted. to absolute loathing. Several of the officers who hbd lived for a considerable time upontheir rations experienoed. similar seusations, and ultimately found it impossible to eat the saitmeat, especizlly the salt beef, although it is admitted that both beef And pork were quite sound and of good quality. It was remarked. that, while Tdsole pieces of salt beef were frequently left unconsumed, sometimes to the extent of hundreds of pounds' weight in a day by a single regiment, nearly nll the pork was eaten, except by seiae of the Scotch regiments. "The deficiencies in the suppliesproxidedbytheConmmissariat, from which the army, and esmecially that part of it swihich was encamped upon the heighits before Sebastopol suffered most, were a dellciency of. fresh meat, a defieiencr of vegetables, a deficiency of fresh bread, particularlyfct the sick, and more especially fgr those *whoae gura wim affected with scurvy, a deficiency of fuel, a deficieqwf-of ^ay and straw to such an extent that enough could' nj*. be procured to fill the paillasses of the sicl;, and, abone, ll, a deficiency of land transport, to which many of this 2tfiez deficiencies are maily to be attributed. , s "~~~~~ B13:ss .amEST "The army appears to have been supplied e-4kl suffli cient proportion of fresh meat while in T,; ;-.aud during the latter days of September, sad 1rey the whole of October;, the cattle obtained in tIle eitlher by capture or purchase,' f eathd., tr wth a.cesi erableproportion, but after the binninB-l:oveasber.hey were dependent nponm the tasttlo ibe otcd. -Frsa thatt time till the'-month of Yafi tLao supply of fresh mealt was not suicient t4 ro'sintain the health of the troops.

The Commimry-General states, and UMe reurns show, that the supply of rice in store was such as would have enabled him to continue the issue; but to also states that, from the defliiency of land transPort, it wwa impossible to carry that additional weight to the front. The troops were then as completely dependent upon the Commissariat, as-if they had xeen on board ship, and were substing a7most exclnsively upon salt meat and biscuit. It was, therefore, most unfortunate that the issue of an article of di^t'so valuable, in those circunistances, as rice should have been suspended In consequence of the wavnt of transport, just at the time t"hen it was muost needed. "When the original order for the issne of two ounces of rice perman expired, on the 30th of September, the Commisary-General states that, finding there was a sufficient quantity in store, and that bowel complaints sill continued toprev3il, he suggested, as a measure beneficial to the health of the arny, the extension of the order to the 15I of November. It is much to he regretted that, when he subsequently found himself unable, from want of transport, to carry the 2 ounces of rice in addition to the salt IMelt. l e ws not induced bythe same motives to infornthe GeasralCommanding-that he had stil enough of rice in store to conitinue the issue, which had become even more necessary than on the 30th of September, and that he did tot call for a decision as to whether the army then suffering not -only from bowel complaints, but a7so froe scurvy, should be deprived of the only vegetable food, * esides biscuit, which was immediately available, or should submit to a reduction of two ounces in the daily supply of sat meat, which a large proportion of the men did not consitur.e. The troops felt the less of the rice severely, many of them declaring that they would rather have lost their rum; * tLt ttey submitted wvithout remonstrance, because the belief apear.s to have been general that the issue of rice had ceased in conequence of the supply being exhausted. " It appears from the evidence of the Commnissary-General that it has not been the practice in the British army to keep the General Commanding informed of tne amount of proVisions in depSt, or available for the use of the troops, but ony of such as be in thc possession of the troops, and in the charge of the Commissariat officers of divisions. It was not untl the latter end of January, when circumstances forced upon Lord PRagln's attention the necessity for his Ricing kept personally informed of the actual amount of the supPlies on which he could rebl for the maintenance of the troops, that periodical returns of the quantities in store at Bodaklavi were ordered to be submitted to him. " It appears to us, not only that periodical returns of the stipplies in store, and available, ought regularIy to be subixitted, but that it ought to be the duty of some officer to call the attention of the General Commanding to such as zire likely, in special circumstances, to prove beneficiaL EIad Lord Paglan's attention been called to the stores of ricc, mnd other farinaceous and vegetable food at his command,* or lad there been any officer on his Staff who could be held Xesponsible for the proper application of the available supplies, there can be no reasonable doubt that the men would isave received, in lieu of two ounces of the salt icat which many of them could not eat, an equal weight of food that 'would have been both more acceptable, and infinitely Snore lieneficiaL "The deficiency of transport, whichL is assigned as the meason why these supplies were not conveyed to the front, useed not have affected the corps in and around Balaldava, which were suffering from the same diseases, though not to the same extent. "L 5LEJUic& A more unaccountable and still more unfortunate failure to apply to the use of the army stores, of which it tMood in the most urgent need, occurred in regard to lime5nice. On the 10th of Decomber 278 cases, containing nearly 20,0001b., arrived by the Eslk, for the purpose of being issued generally to the troops. SmaU quantities obtained f-rot th purveyor, and also, it is understood, from the navy. had been issued to the hospitals for the cure of scurvy during the previous month, but no measures had' been taken to counteract the tendency to that disease vhich was rapidly Ispreading. The necessityforissuinglimejuice as a prophy. lactic had been stated in many of the medical reports to the Inspector-General, and had been especially pointed out in those which he transmitted to the AdjutantGeneral for the months of November and December. In these he anticipates the speedy arrival of a supply that -vroald admit of the issue generaly to the troops of what they so much needed. Yet from the 10th of December, the - limejuice brought by the Esk vas lying in the Commissa- riat stores at Balalava, and none of it vwas issued till the first week in February, an interval during which the sufferings of the army from scurvy were probably at their height. Had the General Commanding been informed of the arrival of that supply, it cannot be doubted that it would have bcen issued to that part of the army which most required it nearly two months earlier. "1 It is somewhat remarkable that the regulations reqllire the issue of limejuice to troops on board ship, when salt =eat is issued for a certain number of days, but that there IL not any similar provision for the protection oF troops on shore, though the necessity may be equally urgent, as it has been in the Crimea, and would be in a fortess that was invested or blockaded. It appears to us, after carefuI consideration of the facts that have come to our knowledge, that it would be expedient, whenever salt meat is issued to troops, to assimilate their diet to that 'wicL is used so successfully in the navy. This has been strongly recommended by several officers, and especially by 3r. Walsh, the naval surgeon in charge af the Marines on shore, who states, in his evidence, that during a service of 21 years he has never seen scurvy in the navy. "I'RESE A.D PRESERN ED VEGETrAsLrS. "The health of the army also suffered from a deficiency of fresh or preserved vegetables. Lord Raglan seems to have hean urgent to supply this deficiency; but it appears that, according to the regulations, vegetables do not constitute a Part of the soldiers' rations, and it is therefore no part of - theordinary dutyof the Commissariat to issue, or even to erovide them. This arrangement, which leaves the soldier to purchase vegetables in the market, may be an advantage to him where such a market exists, but it is obviously inapplicable where, as in the Crimea, there was none. The first nttempta to import green vegetables were not successful, and some time clapsed before the defects in the arrange. 2nents could be so farremedied asto secure a regouar supply. In the meantime scurvy in its ordinary form, and scorbutic diseases in various forms, extended rapidly, tiUl in several YVgimeats hardly a man was free from the taint. " The advantages attending the use of preserved and ceont pressed vegetables, more especially when the army is in Snotion, are so great and obvious, and the men have now Lecone so- ell acquainted with the manner of using them, and relish them so fully, that we venture strongly to recoin anend that they should be regularly icsued to the troops, wshea resh vegetables, in sufficient quantity and in good candition, cannot be provided, and that a specified quantity of the one or of the other should constitate a part of the xeZulaled rations of troops in the field. "5RtH BIt RAD. The only bread issued to the troops, till the month of April, was biscuit, which appeass, horwever, to bave been of exceUlent quality. The sick complained much of the want of soft. bread, and the men who were affected with scurvy, uny of whom continued to perform their duties, were often unable, from the state of their gums, to eat the hard Uisctit, or could eat it only with mruch pain. At length some private estblishments for baking bread, in Russian ovens which3 had been found there, were set on foot by prsi- vate enterprise at alaklava; end th& men, especialy the sick, eagerly purchased the loaf of the- nominal -weight of two pounds; at 29., and even at'2s. 6d. or Sa. The most urgent craving of the sick was for a morsel of soft bread. Shortly after ourarriva an arrangement was made with those establishments, by Lord Raglan's directions, by which they engaged to supply the purveyor with a cer main quantity daily for the use of the hospitals, to be issued, on requisition, as a medical comfort. "We are not awareof any sufficient reason why soft bread might not havo b,en baked at any time for the use of the sick,-and also for the whole army. The French army has been regularly supplied with fresh bread; and the erection of a sufficient nunber of ovens was not an operation inTolving anygreatexrense, or requiring much skillor much time, if it had been undertaken by the proper public departments. There were bakers enough in the regiments to bave worked many more ovens than were required to supply the whole army; and if these could not be spared from their military duties there was no difficulty in procuring bakers from Constantinople. But there appears to have been an indisposition to make the attempt. (See Colonel Tulloch's memorandumt anpendis; page 20.) The Commissary-General understood that a floating bakery had, for several months, been in preparation in England, and it was considered unnecessary, or impossible, to do anything tiU it arrivod "From the informsation we have obtained, we are satisfied that it is of great importance to the health of the troops that they should be regularly supplied with a proportion of soft bread, and ia standing camp, where flour can be obtained, there is rarely any real difficulty in proriding it. " GRZl:D COPFE. "We need not revert to the issue of green coffee, which has been alluded to by nearly aU the witnesses whom we examined. That subject had already been so fuly discussed thst we did not consider it necessary to investigate it. But there isreasonto believe that, being imperfectly roasted and pounded bythe men, it became injurious to their health. This is not only their own opinion, but is also that of those medical officers upon whose judgment we should be most disposed to rely, and it is much to be regretted that the simple expedient of assembling a board of officers, as had been done at Varna, was not resorted to, as they could have recommended tea tobe substituted for coffee. "W When the difficulty about fuel to roast the coffee began to be seriously felt in December, there were 2,7051b. of tea (equal to 173,000 rations) lying in the Commissariat stores at Balaklava. This would have afforded the usual quantity of a-quarter of an ounce per man daily to the corps in front, where the greatest difficulty was experienced in making use of the coffee, till a supply could be obtained from Constantinople, or other quarters, sufficient to make the issue a general one. A temporary supply, too, might probably have been obtained from the navy, as there are generally large stores of tea on board. Nothing of this kind, however, appears to have been attempted, and the coffee continued to be issued in a green state to the men in front till the month of February, though much of it was not usedl in consequence of the difficulty of preparing it. It appears to us, from the statements of a great majority of the medical and other officers examined, that tea would, on the ivhole, be preferable to coffee, especially on a march, provided the rationof sugar were increased by one quarter of an ounce, that is, from 11 ornces to 2 ounces. That change would somewhat diminish the weight to be carried, always an important consideration, and would materially diminish the cost of the ration. It was objected by the CommissaryGeneral, that tea is more likely to be damaged than coffee, especially on a march; but as the whole of the tea used in Russia, and in some countries of Asia, where it is largely consumed, is carried overland from China, there can hardly be any serious difficulty in carrying a supply with an army. "DEFECTIVE COOKING. "One of the causes of sickness in the army. to which al the witnesses refer, is defective cooking. On the march from Old Fort to the Alma, and during the battle, most of the men threw away or lost their camp kettles. Some divisions did not preserve even one in ten of the regulated number, viz., one to every five men. When the army arrived before Sebastopol it was, therefore, impossible to organize the established regimental system of cooking, which is by companies, teUing off a certain number of men per company as cooks. Each man had to cook for himself in his small mess tin or canteen, to procure his own fuel, and to light his own fire. 'FUEL. "For a time there was little di.ficulty in procuring firewood; but after tne brushwood in the vicinity of the camp was consumed fuel could not be obtained, except by digging up roots, an operation which, to unslklful hands, involved great labour and, in bad weather, much exposure. When there was snow upon the ground, and during frost, the men, who were inadequately supplied with tools, and who, from -want of skiU in using them, soon spoiled or broke such as they had, often found it impossible to procure enough of fuel In wet weathertheinexperienced,who composed the great majority, had much difficulty in getting the green or wet wood to burn. Men who had been all night in the trenches, up to their ankles in mud, and who returned to the camp exbausted and benumbed, could not cook food for themselves without first grubbing up roots for fuel, which, in man;y cases, were to be found only at a considerable distance. Many of them wanted either energy or strength enough to undergo that labour, and contented themselves with their biscuit and rum, adding in some cases a bit of raw pork. 3Many more made the attempt to cook their meat, but, im consequence of the difficulties just referred to, the process was often very imperfectly performed, and the meat was eaten half-raw. Even after kettles had been procured, wvhich in most regiments was not until some time in January and after men had been told off to cook for companies, the labour arnd exposure undergone by the fatigue parties sent out to obtain fuel was a serious addition to the other severe and harassing duties which they had to perform. " The Commissariat maintained that it was not the practice of the service to issue fuel to troops in the field; that a soldier was not entitled to a ration of fuel unless in barracks. Lord Raglan, however, on. the llth of November instructed the Commissary-General to provide a sufficient supply of fuel for the ensuing winter; and by a General Order, dated the 4thof December, directed the issue of rations of fuel to thetroops. But, although it appeared that evenlong before the 11th of November the Commissary-General had provided a depot of fuel at Scutari for the use of the army when in barracks, he was not prepared to issue fuel in the field when it was ordered on tke 4th of December. "To provide and issue fuel was, no doubt, a consideramble addition to the duties of the Comminssariat,and the difficulties arising from the deficient state of the land transport, the narrow space for landing stores at Balasdava, and the great amount of labour which the other duties of that department involved, in the peculiar circumstances of the army, may have led the Commissary-General to insist upon the alleged previous practice in the Peninsula and elsewhere of leaving troops in the field to find their own fueL But the circum. stances of the army before Sebastopol were obviously exceptional, and an appeal to precedent was out of place. In consequence of the representations of the CommissaryGeneral, however, the order of the 4th of December appears to have been modified, and it was not until the 29th of December that the troops in and near Balaklava recoived rations of fueL " This apparent want of alacrity on the part of the Com. missariat to provide fuel for the army in the field, could not have afisen from any difficulty in procuring firewood. The southern coast of the Black Sea is wooded down to the shore for hundreds of miles; firewood could have been procured there in Unlimited quantity, but the resources of that coast had not then been ecploredL Wood has more recently been obtained thence at little more than one-fourth of the price paid for it during the winter at Scutali and Constantinople. Unfortanately, after fuel had been provided at Balaklava, the want of land transport made it impossible to carry it to the front, except in small quantities for the use of the hospitals; and, being issued only in the vicinity of Balaklava, it was of no nse to the soldier on the. heights, unless he could find the means of carrying it to the regimental camp. it" PaOcrEn DIEr. "From what has been stated, it appears that the diet provided for the troops was: not well calculated to preserve their health in any circumstances, and that, instead of tending to counteract the other causes of disease to which they -were exposed, it tended rather to aggravate thoseevils. And the same unvarying diet of salt meat and biscuit, without a sufficient supply of vegetables, acting upon constitntions debilitated by-the other causes previously referred to, produced scurvy, whicb, there is reason to beEeve, comn.plcated and rendered more fatal almost every other disease by which the troops were attacked in December and Januay, - "AnUDMACE OF CA'TrLE. "The Commissary-General states, that he considers the issue of fresh meat the rule, and of salt meat the exce4ition; but he has not explained, in a manner that we consider satisfactory, the reason -why this order was revevred. In the countries subject to Turkey, which were easily accessible, ,there is not, and there never has been, any difficulty inprocuring a sufficient number 4of cattle to supply- th army with fresh meat. In: December, when scarcely i4y but salt meat was issued, the.Commissary-General says thbt he had 8,000 head of-cattle secured.;' He attribute- the deficiency in the camp to the want of sea transport, the difficulties of thewinter navigation, and the delays caused by theuse of Balava as the port of the amy. - "All of theso circumstances, doubtless, increased the diMieulty of bringing forwards sufficient number of cattle ; but, looking to the amount of sea transport at his command after the 11th of December, when the sailing horse-transports wero placed at his disposal, for another purposd to which they wero not applied, and could have been' made available for the conveyance of cattle, in addition to( the steam vessels already at his disposal, and, considering the vicinity of Samsoon and other ports on the southern shore of the Black Sea, where cattle could not only have been procured, but were actually tendered to him in Decem-' ber and rejected, we are forced to the conclusion that theCommissary-General was not then sufficiently alive to the importanceo of that article of food; and that the quantity might have been considerably increased during the months of December, January, and February, if proper neasures had been taken for that purpose. Thetime' is not veryremoto when armies depended upon sailing vessels for all the supplies transported by sea, but the Commissary. General was deterred from using such vessels for the conveyance of cattleby what he describes as the ' frightful' proportion of casualties.. This does not appear to us to be a sufficient reason. 3,000 additional bullocks, in the three months abovementioned, would, on the average, have given the whole army fresh meat every alternate day; and we cannot persuade ourselves that three or four of the. sailing horse-trarsports could not have landed that number in three months, in addition to all that were brought by steam vessels, chiefly from the Bosphoros. If there wag difficulty in bringing the additional cattle alive, they might have been slaughtered, and at that season of the year the meat might have been carried without much loss. - in short, it appears to us that fresh meat, in much larger quantities, might have been, and ought to have been, supplied to the army. "The comaon be-Hef that, in the navy, the seamen are fed upon salt meat and biscuit, may, perhaps, have misled poerons who did not niffioiently attend to the precautions which it has been found necessary to adopt in that branch of the service, for the purpose of insuring variety of diet and of counteracting the effects of a diet consisting of the two articles in question. It is also right to keep in view that we are judging after the ovent, when the importance of a sufficient supply of fresh meat has been proved, though not by any means for the first time, by the consequences resulting from tho want of it. " sIssORToChE OF FRESH 3MAT. "Wherever large armies have been collected a tendency to diseases of the bowels has been manifested These are emphatically the diseases of the camp, and it is of the utmost 'importance that every precaution should be taken to counteract that tendency. But experience has proved on many former, and some comparatively recent occasions, that the long use of salt meat increases both the number attacked and the proportion of fatal cases. The influence of improper diet is augmented in proportion to the constitutional depression and predisposition to disease produced by other causes, and in circumstances so unfavourable to health as those in ivhich tho army in the Crimea was placed, by the nature of the servioe, the season at which it was carried on, and the unusual disproportion of the numbers to the amount of work to be done, no practical means ought to have been left untried to protect the troops from the injurious effects of diet-one of the few conditions of the soldiers' existence which were absolutely within controL "Eegarded merely ina pecuniary point of view, irrespective of higher considerations, moral and political, the most wasteful of all expenditure is the expenditure of men. There is hardly any conceivable price that it may be necessary to pay for what is required to preserve the health and efficiency of the soldier that is not advantageously laid out. Every soldier has cost a large sum before he is landed in the Crimeafitforduty, and it costsalike sumto replace him. The valueoftheotherconsideraMtionscannotbeestimatedinmoney, fortheyareaboveallprice. Butthehighestpricethathasbeen paid per lb. for fresh meat, including freight and casualties, was 5 or 6dL, and therefore less than the lowest price at -which salt meat has been put into storo in the Crimea; and if the casualties which, in the winter voyage from th, Bosphorus, in steamvessels, are variously stated at from 14 to 20 per cent., had been double that amount, or even a larger proportion, that would not have been a sufficient reason for leaving the army vithout an adequate supply of what was necessary to preserve the health of the troops. "Considering the preference which has been shown, not only in the present but in other campaigns, particularly those in the Burmese and Chinese empires, for issuing to the troops salt meat and biscuit instead of fresh meat and bread, notwithstanding the alarming extension of diseases of the bowels which usuaUy manifests itself in military operations, there seems reason to apprehend that the facility of obtaining and distributing the former description of supplies may, not unfrequently, have had an influence in causing too ostensive a use of them. " The duties of the Commissariat are, then, im a great mea. sure confined to maintaining an ample stOer of these in the general depiOt by shipments from home, which in. volves little trouble; and the distribution of this supply, according to the numbers in each division, merely involves the simplest operation of arithmetic; but when cattlehave tobe sought out andpurchased, often in remote provinces-have to be fed and cared for, and kept in condition before shipment; when transport has tobeprovided, forage obhtainedfor thevoyage, and subsistence thereafter till theyare given over to the troops-the measure, however useful, is one which must necessarily be attended with much extra trouble, great complication of accounts, and no smaU personal exertion. The preparation of soft bread, in likc measure-involving, as it does, the purchase of wheat, its conversion into flour, the building of ovens, the hiring of bakers, and extensive superintendence-requires a very different amount of trouble and responsibility from what would be created by the receipt and issue of a certain number of bags of biscuit daily. It is, perhaps, but natural under such circumstances that those who have the charge of supplying the troops should cling to a system which tends so materially to relieve their difficujlties duringa protracted campaign: but, asexperience has shou-n that this saving of trouble in the first instance can only be effected at the risk of great suffering, vast expense, and tenfold trouble in the end, the dependence on a diet of salt meat and biscuit only should in future be confined to cases in which the general officer in command has satisfied himself as to the impossibility of procuring other supplies, and, therefore directs, in general orders, the issuie of that dlescription of food. The restriction to this ration should, then, be communicated immediately to the home authorities, in order that they maysendout supplies of preserved meats and vegetables, to counteract its siraneness and innutritious quality. " SUPPLIES OF VEGETADLES COULD BE OBTAIN-D. "The deficiency in the supply of vegetables is even more objectionable and m6re unaccountable than that of thefresh meat. If the armywas to be fed on salt meat, a sufficient supply of vegetable food was known to be indispensable to the maintenance of health. The Turkish provinces could have furnished, and at a later and more unfavourable season did furnish, a considerable amount. There are several varieties which can safely be carried by sea, and which wiU keep several months, of which potatoes and onions are perhaps the best, and the different varieties of preserved vegetables are available at all seasons, and at a moderate cost. A At the time when the army was suffering in consequence of the want of vegetables there was in store, at Balaklava, a considerable supply of vegetable food, both peas and preserved potatoes, which were not issued. The greater part of the peas were not split, but whole,, and the men, experiencing great difficulty in boiling them, became unwilling to take them. They did not know, and do not appear to have been informed, that the addition 'of a smnall quantity of soda would have made the process coam paratively easy; but for this omission the Commissariat cannot be considered responsible. As a reason fornotiss-ing the preserved potatoes during the winter, when they would have been so useful in preventing scurvy, the Commissary General states that the men rejected them, and returned into storeseveral cases that had been issued. On invesMi gating the circumstances, however, it appeared that they had been returned into store at a time when the troops had a sufficient supply of fresh meat and when they understood that they were to pay for one pound of the preserved the price of four or five pounds of the fresh potatoes. When. they were afterwards issled gratis, and the mnen had learnt how to cook them, they became exceedingly populArt' "So ONE SPECIAIY XESPONShLmi FOR DIET, OR FOR TEE ADAPTATIONI OP THEE REOURC TO THEz wARm OF THE AMY. " It seems to be a defect in the system of the British I any thst no one is epecislly responsible f or the Atneas of thediet supplied to the troops," or for the most 'advantageous adaptation of the resources of the countries in w which military operations are carried on to the requirements, in this respect. of the army. Supplies of the utmoet value to health may' thus bo lying within reach, without being made available, because they are not specified in the scale of rations, and because there is no one whose especial duty it is to find them0 out and to suggest their employment. A commander-in-chief may be a man of consummate genius, capable of' attending to everything great or small, buta nation cannot safely ground its system upon the assumption that it can at all times command the services of such men; and itmny be worthy of consideration whether there ought not to be upon the staff of an army in the field an oflicer, holding high military rank, whose duty it should be to devote his attention to the supplyof the army, who should be reoponsible for everything connected with the receipt and issue of supplies and stores of every description, in the same manner as the Quartermaster. General and the Adjutant-General are responsible for the manner in which their departments are conducted, and who should be selected with reference to his special qualifications. smBsTrrusTiof oi rORRTi FOR tm. "A very general opinion is expressed both by commanding officers and surgeons that to continue the extra rations of rum which the troops have been receiving would be injurious both to their health and their habits; and there is a remarkable concurrence of testimony in favour of substi. tuting porter of good quality for a part of the rationis of rum, or even for the 'whole, as well as in favourof enabling the men to buy good porter, by providing a sufficient quantitytobe suppliedata fixed and moderate price, while the army is in standing camp, under such regulations as may be considered expedient. "It cannot, we fear, be doubted that many, especially of the young soldiers, who had no disposition to indulge in ardent spirits, or to whom the rum was at first even distasteful, hero Cqciurd : habit or dram-driking by tho uLse of the rations issued to them; and it is believed that the oabstitution of good porter, which is nutritious, antiscorbutie, and, in moderate quantities, on the whole beneficial, would also tend to correct or to prevent the formation of habits which are injuiious both to health and to discipline. "StVPPLJES OF FOOD NOW AMB!D&NT. "At afutareo imewe shal be prepared to submit somesug. gestions as to tho rations of troops in the field; meanwhile we have the honour and satisfaction to report that, before our departure, the supplies of food to the army in the Crimea were abundant, and th&e diet of the soldier, in the opinion of those who are best able tojudge, better than any army in the ficld has, in any former campaign, been regularly supplied with. We are able to state that, in their entire satisfaction with the rations now issued, the men concur with their officers. The only objection, so far as we can ascertain, is to the inferior condition of the cattle; and the grounds of this objection are in course of being removed, as the animals are daily improving in condition upon the new grass, which is now abundant in the gra-zing countries. But as the natives of those countries are not in the habit of winter-feeding their cattle, they wrill begin to fall off after the month of October, unless arrangements are made by the Commissariat to have them properly fed and kept in condition. Such arrangements, instead of increasing the cost of the meat, would, probably, produce a considerable saving; for the oxen, if so attended to, would yield nearly double the quantity, and of better quality. We anticipate no difficulty in maintaining, or, if necessary, in largely increasing, the supplies of cattle, and also of vegetables, from the Turkish provinces. "BAT IORSES ,MD MIUILS. "The most disastrous of the deficiencies to which we have referred was the deficiency of the land transport. This was not confined to the transport more properly belonging to the Commissariat, but extended also to the public and private bhlt animals, the former being such as, previous to the formation of the Land Transport Corps, were provided by the Comnissariat) and handed over to each corps in regulated proportions for the carriage of the field equipment, the latter being the private property of the officers, 'who are, however, authorized to draw rations for them. Public bit animals appear to have been provided for such corps as were in Bulgaria, and most of the officers of those corps also provided themselves; but when the army embarked for the Crimea nearly all of both descriptions were left behind, and it was not till the end of October that about half the regulated number was landed in the Crimea. A second and smialler detachment arrived in January, but by that time a great part of those received in October were dead, or no longer effective, and, in consequence of the continued deficiency of forage, and the exposure and fatigue, most of those received in January shared the same fate. When the Commissariat transport failed, this deficiency of regimental transport, which otherwise would have been of comparatively little moment in a standing camp, was severely felt. " LAND TRANSPORT. "All the witnesses examined upon the subject are of opinion that the duties which the men had to perform under arms in the trenches, and on pickets and guards, involved an amount of labour and exposure as great or greater than they could bear, without injury to their health. It was, therefore, of the utmost imiportance that they shduld be saved all additional labour and exposure, but, owing to the deficiency'of land transport, they had to perform a large amount of the work that ought to have been done by horses and mules. The roads, or tracks, were so deep in mud that the journey which the men had to perform from the camp on the heights to Balaldava and back, carrying up rations, warm clothing, huts, or ammunition, frequently occupied 12 hours, during the whole of which time they were without food, shelter, or rest-unless standing in deep mud, drenched and cold, instead of struggling through it, can be called rest. It was in consequence of the want of transport that, even after firewood had been provided at Balaklava, the men had to undergo the labour and exposure of digging up roots to cook their food, without always being able to procure enough for that purpose. It was in consequence of the want of transport that the men were repeatedly on short rations, and that they were deprived, for about six or seven weeks, of their ration; of rice, which would have been so beneficial at that precise time, when hardly any vegetables were supplied to them, and hardly a mau in the army escaped the prevailing diseases. The men were overworked in the trenches, and on pickets and guards; and they 'suffered in health from the excessive fatigue, watching, and exposure which those duties involved. To these, in consequence of the want of transport animals, were superadded other duties, involving an amount of fatigue and exposure which alone would have been trying to their constitutions. Several of the officers stted that the draughts for their corps, which were excusel duty in the trenches for the first 10 days after their arrival, were sent, during that interval, on fatigue to Balaklava, but that it became necessary to relinquish the practice, because a fatigue party to Balaldava sent so many of the young soldiers into hospitaL "From the commencement of the campaign in the Crimea the scale upon which the Commissary-General pro. posed to provide land transport for the army appears to us to have been dangerously small; yet the scale upon which it i was actually provided fell far short of even what he had proposed. From a return prepared by the Commissariat, there appears the startling fact that in January, 1855. the whole number of effective animals belonging to that department v.was 333 pack-horses and mules, and 12 cameLs. The Commissary-General had considered it necessary, before the army should move from Varna, to have transport at his disposal equal to about 14,000 pack animals. " In the month of October, however, assuming that the whole army was fixed immoveably in its position, the available transport may have been sufficient for purely Commissariatpurposes, exdlusiveof the conveyance of firewood,- that is, for the carriage of the rations of food and forage from Balaklava to the camps of the different divisions. But from the commencement of the operations transport was required for siege purposes also. From the evidenee of the Commissary-General, it appears that this diversion of a part of his transport from Commissariat to siege puposes prevented him from conipletir,g the formation of a depOt near head-quarters which he hadcommenced, and which was a measure of great importance to the army, as subsequent events too clearly proved. He was, therefore, from the commencement of the operations against Sebastopol, aware that the transport be had collected vas not all avaiable for Commissariat purposes, and was not sufficient for all the purposes for which it was required In answer' to the question why, in those circumstanes, he. did not increase the transport in the Crimea, he states that he had as many animals as he. could feed. The measure of the amount of transport to be provided for the army in the Crimea was not, therefore, what was require, but what the Commissariat could feed. The reason for not increasing the amount of transport was not that a greater numher of anlialwas unnecessary, butthat a greaternum-. ber could not be fed in the Crimea. But if proper arrange.. mentshad been made to provide the army with forage forthe winter, wherever it might be at that season, the forage would have been Eavilable for isse in the Crimea. T "SUPPLY OF HAY. !'The Commissary-Genejal had indeed concluded a con-t tract for about 1,000000 pound, or about. 80tons- of hay, to be made atBayookTchLIedge, onthe Sea of Marmoraand hydraulic presses wereastnt out-frozmEn&landto com-- press it for shipmnent. The contractors failed, it' is said, to complete their contract, and only About '60O or 700 tons of hay were 'nade. -;-They appear to have been men without capital, who borrowed money at a tigh rte of interest to ea=y out their various contrct. with the Commissariat. Their credit was such that it wa, found necessary to rmke an amngement bywhich the sum sfli7ng due to them by the Commissariat were to be paid Into thehands of the banktr who advanced the funds, The bankerconsideredithaardous to make large advances I to enable them to carry cut it contract for hay which w liable to be reiected on accoumt of its quality, orbecaune the whole quantity contracted forhadnotbeenprepareL Objec. tions to receive delivery appear to have been raised on both of these grounds, and payment wasj in consequenoe, withheld. The contractors having no means of discharging the , debt they had incuwred to the bankers ntil they receivedthe price of thehay, and conceiving, as they assert, that it had been rejected by the Commissriat, entered into an arrangement to sell it to the French. The British Commissariat then claimed it as their property, and applications were made by both parties to the Porte to compe2l delivery of the hay, which each asserted theyhad purchased At lengtli it was secured to the British Commisariat. But in the meantime the hydraulic presses had been - erected in the vicinity of Constantinople, more thxn 15 miIes from the place where it had been collected; and it became necessary to carrythe loose hay that distance, either by land or water, before it could be pressed. This operation could not be carried on in bad weather, and thus, by defective arrangements throrghout the whole transaction, the only provision for supplying tho army with hay which had been made in Tarkey was rendered nugatory, at a time when 600 or 700 tons in the Crmea would have been invaluable. The Commissary-General admits that if the presses hadbeenerectedattheplacewhere the hay was made he could have fed more animals; and there can be little doubt that overy addition to the transport in the Crimea saved the lives of men. " When the roads or tracks between Balakiava and the camp broke up about the 20th of November, andbecame one greataloughof deep and tenacious mud, impassable for Commissariat carts, the transport power of that department was reduced to one-third of its former amount, for a horse or mule will draw in a eart three times the weight it can Carry on a pack. Even so early as the 14th of November, the day of the hurricane, the roads had become diflicult, and the trensport animal began to suffer. The Commiisary-G,neru then resolved to bring up a part of the reserve transport which had been left at Varna, and had subsequently been ordered thence to Constantinople. At this time, however, he only contemplated bringing up 250, and the Jason sailed for that purpose on the 26th of November, and returned toBalaklava on the 16th of December, having been absent 20 days. The averagepassage atthat season, including coaling, watering, &c., appears to have been about 1,5 days. The Jason thus exceeded the average time by a fev days, of which two may be accounted for by the time occupied in sending for and bring in the muies from Tchykmedge, where they were recovering from the effects of the journey from Varna. They had been badly cared ifor, and many were utterly useless; a certain number, however, arrived at Constantinople, in very bad condition, about the end of November; 250 of the most serviceable were selected to be shipped in the Jason, but even these appear to have hardly been considered effective by the Commissariat officers when they arrived at Balaklava. " On the 11th ofDecemberthe sailing horse-transports of the army were placed at the disposal of the CommissaryGeneral, to bring up transport animals, but were not employed for that purpose. On the 24th, hel applied for a steamvessel,which appearstohavobeenimmediatelyordered. Onthe2Sth heappliedespeciallyfortheJason, whichhad then discharged her cargo of animals, &c., and, in-pursuance of ordters given on the 24th, she was immecdiately placed at his disposal, and sailecd on the 29th for Constantinople. Xo makes it a ground of complaint, with reference to thereinforcement of the transport in the Crimea, that, having sickl on board for Scutari, she was detained till the 7th of January landing them; but, having been questioned on the subject, he admitted that, after landing the sick at Scutari, she was sent by the Commissariat, though not by his orders, to the Sca of Mamora to take in a cargo of fuel, and he could not say that she might not have been absent a week or 10 clays for that purpose.. The deficiency in the land transport of the army cannot, therefore, be accounted for, on the ground that he could not obtain sufficient sea transport to convey the animals he was desirous of bringing to the camp. " The want of a road from Balaktava to the front, pass. able for Commissariat carts, greatly increased the difficulty of supplying the army after the middle of November; but the officers commanding divisions, who were examined upon the subject, are unanimous in their opinion that it -would have been impossible to employ a sufficient number of men to make the road, and at the same time to carryon the military operations in which the army was engaged. The only remedy, therefore, was to increase the number of transportanimals; and Lord3Raglan, it is stated by the Quartermuaster-General, after 'unceasingly and urgently' impressing upon the Commissary-General the necessity of preparing a sufficiency of transport, 'finally sent officers of the army to purchase auimals at Eupatoria, Constantinople, Smyrna, Sicily, &c. ; this measure was, however, deprecated by the Commissary-General, who declared he had not the means of feeding them.' "In answer to the question, was the Commissary-General at any time urged to increase the amount of transport? the Quartermaster-General says, 'Unceasingly by the Commander of the Forces, personally, and by myself.' " The real cause of the deficiency of transport appears, therefore, to have been the want of forage, not the want of ships or of animals; and a similar failure to provide the requisite forage would again limit the number of animals available for the army in the Crimea, whatever might be the number in possession of the Land Transport Corps. It may be hoped that the formation of that corps will prevent the recurrence of any similar calamities from the same cause. " With respect to deficiencies of forage, which form the next branch of our report, there is -very considerable dificulty in arriving at avccrate conclusions, because, previous to the Ist of January, no account of such deficiencies was kept by the quartermasters of cavalry; but it is admitted, both by the .: regimental and Commiseariat officers, that very large deficiencies did occur in the hay and chopped straw prior to that date. There appears always to have been enough of barley in store or in the harbour, though there was occasionally much difficulty in getting at it, owing to the crowvded state of the shipping, and it was at all times difficult to find conveyance for it to any considerable distance. The hay and straw began to fail about the 14th of November, after the gale in which so many vessels were lost off the coast; prior to that date no serious deficiencies have been established. " During the great scarcity of hay and straw, between the 14th of November and 1st of January, the Commissariat seem to have been in nearly the same difficulty as theQuartermasters in regard to furnishing any accurate statements of their isses, The forage had to be sent up on the regimental bAt animals, there being no other means of transport. It was often late before they reached Balakiava, and they were in so weak a state that the men sent with them could only venture to carry up a portion of the forage due; what was left behind would probably be considered by the. Quartermaster a short issue, while the Conmissariat officer would, perhaps, hold that he had made an isse in fuLl It is admitted on all hands that there was great irregularity in the arrangements at that time, which we hope will be considered a sfficient reason for our not attempting to enter into any details of the deficiencies at that period. It may suffice to state that they must have been very considerable indeed, and, coupled with exposure, were no donut the cause of very heavy loss and inefficiency.* There is one case, however, from which such, serious consequences have arisen that it requires some special notice. "WA'rT OF FOrAGE If LiGHT CAVALRY 3pIGA-D. "Tho Light Cavalry Brigade, which bad for some time previously been stationed in the valley adjacent to Bal va, was removed, first to the vicinity of head-quarters, for two or three days, and thereafter, on the Ist or 2d of November, to Inkermaun, where it was stationed near the Wsndmill, a distance of at least seven or eight miles from Balaklava. This change at a time when the roads were in an extremely bad state, and vhen there-was great difliculty in obtaining the means of transport, created very serious obstacles to a proper supply of forage being obtained. " It is alleged by Deputy-Assistant Commissary-General Crool;khnks that there was a certain quantity of hay at Balaklava, but not the means of carying it to the front; occasionally he managed to bring up a little till the 14th of 'November, when the supply failed entirely. After that date the want of-transport affected the supply of barley also, which on several days did not exeed from 111b' to 21b. daily per horse;being all that they hid to keep them alive. The returns of one of the regiments 'sow that, for the last four days they were on the ground, the average was only about 211b. for eachhorse, previously exhausted-as they

The adjousned esxmination of Mr. Mfark Boyd, stook Ind share broker, of Ba k-buildings, was resumed this 2norning. 3Mr. Roxburgh appeared for the asignees; Mr. Lawenco for the bankrupt. The bankrupt, examined by Mr. Boxburgb, deposed that the baJance of 63,4G61. in the Svdney consignments' account belonged to Benjamin Boyd. d he bankrupt, however, was tatitled to debit vioua charges against tbat balance. For inEtance, the expenses for clerks and offices in London woulct amount to about 17,0Z00.; the Variouspayments made by him on account of B. Bona and his own claim for attending to his business would amount to a further conaiderable sum. Mr. LxviuNcx submitted that the banknrpt ws not bound to account to the representatives of the Royal Bank ofAustrali in-rcspect of his transactions with the late B. Boyd, sho was released rom his obligations to the builc aeve ral years agn. .Mr. BoxBuRGu 1 Ee-id he represented the assgnees acting under the bankruptcy. The bankrupt was a debtor in respect of his private obligations, in respect of his stock. brolcing trnsactions as apartner of th firm of B and M. Boed, and in respect of the debentures of the bank signed byl1m, amounting to 300,000!. or 400,0001. The bankrupt, as a director of the bank, was further liable to the shareboleers in respect of its lossez. 31r. L%wrc. iCBZ with reference to the creditors on debentures, stated that the official assignee would shortly be in possession of funds sufficient to pay 20s. in the round, as proceedings had bcen 'alcen against all the shareholders who were able to pay up their calls. His Ho-oun saiathat had nothing to do with the question whythe Court should be troubled with an investigation into an old account between the banulapt and his deceased brother. Mr. IIOXBUrRGO said if the balance-sheet did not present a true account of the bankrupt's transactions the assignees were entitlecd-to investigate any item. - His H0.NoUs.-WVho do you say is the creditor in respect of the 63,4660.? The Bankrupt.-Benjamin Boyd. ,Mr RoxBVRGII said that would have the effect of alterirg the whole face of the balance-sheet; it would make the jomnt obligations of B. and ML Boyd 70,0001., instead of as at present. his was a sad prospect for the shareholders of the Royal Bank of Australia, against which there appeaed on the other side of the bannlupts' account a claim of 37,0001.

His Hoxors said he cared little for what the public night thinkl he was willing that a careful and impartial inquiy should take place, but hchad nothing to do with the general morality of the bankrupt's proceedings. Xr. ROXBURGH said, if the bankrupt were allowed to pass his last exav&ation, it would be a step towards his obtaining a certificate and resumning trade. M1is HoNoU aaid,-All this.confusion would appear to bave arisen from the bankrupt's books being in an incompfete state at the time of thebank's sspension. It was said from this that there bad been actual inavery; h thought thatunfair. It was trae that the oourse ursued had proved very mischievous.

AMIDAZESEX SE&S&0N8S aurdqy, Feb 2. - - (Befosr Mr. PAIEY,Q. C., AstangJudc.;) Richard Cross and M-arshal Cross, father a,d wn, the latter 19 years of age, surrendered to take-their trial on an indictment in which they were charged With having inlicted grievous bodily harm on Charles Craymer,and with a eom,on assault on the said Charles Craymer. There was a cross indictment, charging Craymer and arother sith an assault on the twro first-named defendants. lr. Ballantine appeared for the prosecufion; Mr. Parry for the deiendant. The prosecutor, it appared, Was an engineer and mrill. wright, living at 46, ahere-street, St. Luke's, and was sonin-law of an elderly lady named Trevelyan, living at 48, Herbert-street, Hoxton, The elder defendant, who, it was ,tated, vws a retired publican, took apartments at the latter residence for his fear children, but zooni afterwards a Mrs. Noble andcchild were introduced, andthe house was kept in such a noise and uproar, that at length Mirs. Davidson, a msrried daughter of Mr Trevelyan, who had the suanagement of the house, her mother being too infirm to at-end to it, had to speak to the mother of the child about it. On the evening of the day on which Mrs. Davidson complained the elder defendant sent for her to his apartmeuts and inquired how she had dared tony' anythlng about the c!ild being there, and said it should remain as long as he did. She sted the reaison of her comRlaining, and he then used some foul espressions, teling his children to cal her " woman." and "creature," instead of mrs. Davidson, and she left.' Nlext morning he insulted her and her husband, and in the evening ho sent 'for her again, but she was ifraid to-go alone, and asked her brother-in-law, the prosecutor, who had just caled, to go with her, and he did, o. He asked her some question as to rhenhe was equiiedto leave, and the payment of rent, which she said she could not give a defiaite nswer to. He remarked that rhe would not do, upon which the prosecutor. stc?ped in and asked if he should do. " Oh, yes; you'll do,' said tho el Wer defendant, throwing off his coat, and the younger laid ho'.d of him behind, whle his father beat him aboutthe head with a fornidable life-preserver, causiing bloodto flowfreelydowvn his face. Craymer seizeda pair of tongs to defend himslf, and struck the father a blow under the eye, and then dropping the tongs, he seized him by the throatandwrestedthehfe-preserverfromhim. Mrs.Davidson ran downstairs, Cross after her, saying "Ive got somnething here that 'll put through you ;" but, seeing two gentlenren on the door step, he ran hack again, got his cap, and went off for a policeman; but who, when brought, refused to interfere. One of the daughters had a gash on her arm, which she said her father had. done with a knife in- the struggle while she was tr32nl to prevent his violence,* Foir the dofenoo it uargoai that ths prosecuttor was cn intruder in MIr. Cross's apartments, and that at the time he was insolent enough to 3;eep his hat on and smoke a ciar'further, that hewas the aggressor, and thatitwas from'iinw that Mr. Cross snatched the life-preserver. Tn support of this the mother of the child alluded to was called, and, having spoken as to the statement, she said, in addition, that the irst blow was given by Craymer with the tongs, acnd that when Cross snatched the lifc-prcscrver he threw it onthe sofa and did notusecit.l MIr. BAs. B 'er replied, and said he did notinthe least wish to press the case against the younger defendant. The AssISTANT-JUD E, having summed up the case, The jury found the father Gusiliy of a common assault, and Acquitied the son. M1r. BALLA.N-mE said the defendant had been concerned in other matters of personal violence, and a little while ago prosecuted some of the committee of a literary institution at iangsland for an assault because they wonld not suffer him to interrupt alecture. - - Mtr. PaY objected to these statements. The defendant certainly waos mixed up in a scuffle which led to the loss of~ a life, buthe was notimplicated in the charge, it occurreda veat manyg years ago; it had nothing whatever to do with te case, and ought not to have'been mentioned. Charles Cravyneramd Emma Davidson were then charged with an assault on Richard Cross Mr. PARauY said it appeared tohim that, as the evidence of the witness, Mrs. lToblc, had been already given, the jury had given their opinion on the whole case, and he should therefore call no evidence on-the present eharge. The defendants were accordingly Acquitted. Trhe CsIszsrNr-JecE sentenced the'elder Cross to two months' imprisonment, and to pay a fine of 10l. - William Elphie Gorige, 4G, described as a chymist, was convicted on *iday of e=sezzlirg three sms of money, amounting to 2&, which he had received in his capacity as collector to the Rev. Archibald Montgomery, and others, trustees of St, Mary's Hospital, at Paddington. Mr. Ballantine prosecuted, Mr. Parry defended. It was stated that the prosewution had been taken up by a guarantee society whichi had been rsonsible for the'pn. soner's integrity, as thev considered it their duty to do so, fiuding thattheauthoritses atthe hospital w.ere disposed to. take a very lenient v,iew of the prisoner's conduc£. he COUR@T sentenced him to 12 months' hard labour. A prisoner named Crowley was charged with stealing a horse cloth, and another, nanmed Brown, with receiving the same feloniously. Mr. I,ogie prosecuted.'* The prisoners were tried at the last session on a similar charge, hut Cro vley wias acquitted because the evidence of an accomplice in the theft was not corroborated. Brown was then convitetd, and sentenced to SiX years' penal servitude. The trial of tbis ense and another was Postponed to afford an oppo'rtunity to proeure further corroborative evidence; bnt none was forthcoming as to Crowley. Brown wvas again found GsiTj, and Crowley AiXequd. The ASSISTAhT-.TUuGE now sentenced Brown to be transported for 14 years, leaving it to the authorities to determnlnewhichof thetwo sentences he should undergo.

Johnson and Walker, gold refiners of AiLdersgate-street, 50 ouances of gold. the property of Messrs. Brat and others. supposed to have been stolen on its transit from London to Paris. Mr. Bees, of the firm of Wilde, Itees, and Co., attended to watch the proceedings o-n Te parlt of Messrs. Nenve, Lyon, Alemand, and Sons, bankers at Paris, and also of Mressrs. Abel and Co., of London. M r. J. C. Rees attended, on the part of the South-Eastern Railway Company, to watch the proceedings. Mr. Lewis defended the prisoner. j Mrichael Haydon, baving beensworn,said,-About3o'clock yesterday afternoon Brett and I stopped the prisoner in the lIac7ney-road. I told him wewere officers. Ho said, gYes, that is right. I know 5ou; what do youwant!" I told him that in May last a large robbery of gold had taken nlace, between London and Paris, the property of buLion IeaIers and mercharts in the city; that from inquiries I had made I found that he had been engaged in seling large nuantises of gold, and upon two7occasions some of similarquality to that which had been stolen. I ask-ed him if he X.iould give me some account of the circumstances under which tbat gold had come into his possession? He said, "I have got no gold; you have forld no gold on me. Alderman WIRE.-Bnt you had not searched him, had you' , Haydon.-I had not. He then said, "I don't know anythmg about any gold." I told him I had reason to believa that he did know. Hc replied, "LL-now nothing about it if you want to know anything more you must take me into custody." I told him as he had dened nl knowledge and refused to nive any account, that I shoda think it my dutyto doiso. le at firsteosbectedto oprgoing toehis house, as we had no search-warrant, bnt he afterwards consented Wothen I commenced searchlng himn he sddenly became in sensible and fecl downu spon this I gave an alanmn ie his wife whopavehimrseewater, andho e recovered. I found on him the portemonnaic wbich I produce, ,which contained .t$ in gold, a seven-shilling piece, two charter mapoleons, two slullings in silver, and adiatnond stud; a ekc7ethook cntainins tpwe £10 naotesof the Banko of England and some seet,oran a and sarious papers. We then accompanied the nlrsoner nupstairs)whaere be opcned an iron safe and took fromn it a rll of notes and a bag of gold, which he handed Cross-examined by 31r.

Johnson in |Aldersgate-street, on the dates mentioned- in thc charge sheet, 50 ou7nces of gold-in bars, supgposed to be n art of that ,stolen between London and BParis, and of which he refused to giveanyaccount. I think Brcttwasnear enoughto hear the conversation at the time of the prisoner's apprehension. Instead of saying,-"Ihavenogold,"t liedidnotsay " I have *no stolergoldg"hedid.notuethe ords "the rold"bnt "any igold." [Atthisperiod of the proceedings the LordMayor enIteTedtheconrt,andtookhisseatbythesideofAldermanwire, ;when Mfr. Oke, the second clerk, rad overthe previus part -of the examination]. The gold- of'whichlhavespoken, as' stolen inay last, was bar gold of various qualities. I know the asay of aportion of.11 bars that were stolen inMay last. I founudnobar gold u on the pr'isoner, and none at his house. I.was engaged in aming ing,rries respectng this matter tinl nearly I o'clock this morn¢g, which prevented mce from .going over the prisoner's papers, and of- aseertaiing - whether they contain any memoranda relating to this gold. Iascertained in the course of my inquiries that the prisoner is a man of property, -The prisoner did not propose to take fBrett and myself to his house; on the contrary,lhe stronglyop7posed it, and it w as not till I said, "I musst take you to the station first, and then go back and search your house,"that he conlsented. J. Brett, city detective officer, said,-I was in company with Haydon yesterday in the HEackney-road. After Haydon told the prisoner what he charged him with, the latter said, "-You arenotgoingtosearchmybhouse; have you got any search warrant?" Haydon replied, No, but that as he was a prisonerhe shouM do so on his own authority. The prisoner at first objected to this, but ultimately consented to our going there, saying at the same time, that we should find nothmg there. Wien we got into the parlour he sent his family downstairs. The prisoner then took out hispurse, the contents of which he gave to Havdon. Unstairs he unlocked an iron safe and produced a rol of notei and a bag of sovereigns, the amount of the former being 370l, and of the latter 264. laydon took out of the safe one or two rings; the priLorer said, "It's no uaeyourl oolcin, you don't think you wiU find-anytbing here,-- do you-' and we found nothing more except some memoranda, which Haydon brought away. - -Cross-examinedby 3Mr.Leawis.-Ido not think theprisoner said, "It's no use your searching the house, I have no stolen property," but he sed words to that effect. That was the inspressioul hc conveyed to my mind. lIe said, "You will find no gold upon me." It is veryhkelylhe may bave used the words, " No stolen. cold." I anderstood him to mean as much. I do not believe he made use of the words "the gold." He stated that he had never had any dealings in gold, after we told him that we had searched Mfessr. Johnson's books. r. 7. Johnson, of thc firm- of Johnson and Walker, gold, refiners, of 89, Aldersgate.street, said,-I first became acqusinted with the prisoner about three months ago, when Eecanetoonr shop tosellsomegoldinbars.

Monday, November the 7th, was the first day I saw hire, And I then purchse of him 23oz. 2dWts in parusf baWs, For this I gave him 84. 3s, 8d.

I think he told me it was Australian gold mixed with ether metal, butJI will not be certain of ths. He did not say how he beci.ne possessed of it.

Mr. Lewis then proceeded te contend that the prisoner ought at once to be discharged ; no evidence havinog been given to show that any feloiny had beeo committed, it could not be said that the prisoner Ha ever been in possession of property, either knowing is to have been stolen, or having stoen it bimself.

CHURCH DISCIPLINE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIhES. Sir,-If yot will employ your powerful influence to bring about a simple and effectual method for dealing with disorderly clergymcn, I wiU undortake to say that from no body of men will you receivewarmerthanksor support than from the clergy themselves. Thoso of us who are trying honestly to do their appointed work know well what difficulties and discouragements beset the clergyman's path; but give us a clerical neighbour amioted with Dr. Twia'a chronio " aoluiess of knees," and onr spirit is gone for ever. Let the reverend victim of this "' unsteadiness of gait " come into your parish (as in our case) on certain festive occasions-such as Easter Monday or Whit-Tuesday, or whenever he may have a chance of showing a little " too much hospitality "-let him proceed to sing comic songs at 2 o'clock in the morning to an applauding audience in the big room at the Blaek Bear, and then, in the undue exercise of his " hospitable" in. stinct,, let him roU under the table, to be carried home to his quiet parsonage, and followed speedily by the viUage joctor, who, of course, treats hiz patient as merely suffering from an attack of weakness of legs; letis go. on for a nunmber of years; let thl1g leaven of in Ina ori 3 wodC Wen through alt the nelghbouring smaii farmers, who are generaUly too ready to appreciate the " hospitality" of the "j olly old parson," aud then look at the effects,-a wide-spread indifference to all religion, the serious-minded first scandalized and then sparated, the church comparatively empty, the communion deserted, the confirmation and every eother rign of a care for tho things of religion more or .ess afected, and for all this no remedy. You go 'perhaps to your bishop, and you come back very much as you went, except perhaps with a new and mostuncomfortable suspicion of a church which plainly cannot protect itself. All honour then to Archdeacon AUen or anybody else who has the courage to move in this matter; and depend upon it, Sir, if yen wrill sapport his efforts with your p)owserfult pen you will have the thanks of every honest man,lay or cleric, and at the same time wil do infinite service to the Church of England and the general cause of trute religion and virtue. Your obedient servant. A COUNTRY CLERGYMAN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TD3ES. Sir,-Vlth yonrremarks on church discipline in myrmind, I met with a letter from Lord Grenville to the Marquis of Buclitigham, dated lNovembor 6, - 1799, from which the followvig is an extract:- "' I have been ruminating on some ecclesiastical projects, but I do not Inow whether I shel be able to. bring them to zeear. "Mynotion is to st eugathn the legal powers of tho bishops, so as to gi e them effdftive meanis both of suspension and deprivation in all cases, both of improper life and manners and of remissness in the execution of certain stated duties -which they are to be required to exact from their parochial clergy; to enable them, from the cdapter in their dioceses, at their own choice to augment the number of tleir archdeacons or visitants, under whatever name may best suit the otd constitutional forms of the church (these might be the rural deans); to requirethern, -or intheir absenc the archdeAcon, to hold fixed and invuriale annual visit6tions, at whkh (calling, if necessary, to their aid a certain numaber of their beneficed and dignified clergy) they should reeievo tho reports of their visitants, and should at such visitation, or at furthest the next visitation, proceed by sentence, either'of suspension or deprivation, agamnst all who should appearion such reports to e4f candaleslife or conversation, or to havebeen reaiss in the performance of such stated2uties as above. " As to parochil residence, the idea would be to require that no clergyman should, on any pretence, be non-resident on his living, without appeinting a curate to be there constantly resident in his room. t" By what I have called stated duties, I mean that from those resident clergTmen who would no longer have the plea of other duty to perform I would certainly exact by enumeration many points of their duty (evening service, catechism, visitation of the sick, and other points) which are now growing- or have grown into disase" Saeh were lord Grenville's projects in 1799-more than 55 years ago-but not much has been done since then; and the Archdeacon Allen's proposal for courts-clerical similar to courts-martial is not perfect-what is 9-stll it is the nearest to perfection that can be effected. I suggested it 25 years ago in a visitation sermon published with the approbation of the clergy, and I cannot see why it should not be tried. Your ebeant srvant PRESBYTEXR. Feb. 1.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir,-Mr. Walpole has referred us to his former Parliamentary conduct. Iook at VoL 3 of Hansard, p. 915 (1852), and you will see that Mr. Walpole, when he was Home Secretary, and brought in his Mitia Bill, endeavoured to conciliate Mr. Biight and the Marchester men by a clauso depriving the Crown of the power to call out the Militia in case of rebellion. Mr. Walpole, in an apologetic speech addressed to Mr. Bright, declared that he withdrew this clause with great "reluctance, in deference to the universal opinion of the House." . Look, again, at Hansard, 1855, and you will see that he spoke and voted against the Tarkish Loan Bill; this was on the 20th of July. If Mr. Walpole had then been successful the Western alliance would have been dissolved; Sebastopol would now be standing; there would be no Swedish Treaty; and the German Powers would have joined Russia for such terms of peace as she might be pleased to accord. Before such enormities as these his democratic proposal to give the franchise to the militia sinIs into comparative insignificance. Will the Senate return as their representative one who is either unable to 3udge of the effect of his own acts, or is so blinded by party feeling as to be indifferent tothe conse. quences? I am.

HAsm Q TEsrow.-The origin of the present war was a question about the 'eustodyof a church key. The Cafife war was about a hatchet. The troubles in New Zealand aU turned upon a certain flagstaff. If we should be embroiled withtheUnited States, it will be about Mosquitoes. If we quarrel with Persia, it will be for a Helen in the person of one Mrs Hashim. When blr. Murray arrived at the Persian Court he found one Mirza Hashim under the protection of the British embassy, the said Hashim being highly obnoxious to the Persian Minister. Mr. Murray does not seem to have troubled his head to ascertain whether the Birza was entitled to the protection he hadobtained ornot-whether anunoffending man or a scamp. English diplomacydehghts in 'protection, for it showsthe power of the British envoy in defance of the national authorities. So the sentiment as to the worthy afsbhim was- "Iknownot,Icarenot,if ilt'sinthy heart; "I know nil protect thee, whatever thou art." FHasim was accordingly to be removed out of harm's way to a pest at Shiraz. T2he Persian Mlinister protested, claiming I ashim as a servant of the Government, and threaten. ing to seize him if he left the bounds of the miS£ion. For a material "srantee, meanwhile, the Sadr seized Mr. Hashim. ThAis was a violation of the sanctity of British protection. Mr. Murray demanded Mrs Hasim The MEinisterrefused to deliver the Helenup, andinsinuated that Mr. Muray was her Paris. Uiponthis Mr. Muray Xtrack his nag, and broke off all relations with the PersianGovernment.' Could there be a prettier quarrel than this?; How dignified all the circumstances ! Surely Hashimwas born to mnake a hash for Mlr. Murray 7 Such is the diplomatic disservice. And whois Mr. Tunny, will now be asked. Mr. Murray is a man of good friends, who showed some knowledge of the West for which he was sent to the East, with the fortunate result we now witness, and for the end of protecting Hasldm cortte g'il coute.-Examiner.

ON THE SECURITY OF LETTERS SENT BY POSr. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Since the publication of the proceedings taken against the postmaster of Rugeley for opening a letter sent by me to htr. Gardner I have received various communications, some containing inquiries and others snggestions, re. specting the proper modo of securing lettors transmitted by post. WIill you allow me the space of a fev lines in your paper for making a general reply to these correspondents? My letter *vas sent in an adhesive envelope, not because this was the best security for its transmnission lmopened, but rather on account of the implicit confidence which I nave been accustomed to place in all persons connected with the Post-office. An adhesive envelope, it is well known, may be easily opened in afew minutes, the letter read, and again restored to the envelope, which may be so reclosed as to deceive completely the person to whom it is addressed. It is supposed that sealingwax offers abetter security, but a letter having a wax seal may be easily broken open and reclosed, with the wax impression so little injured as not even to attract the attention of the receiver. The most effectual security appears to me to be the free use of sealingwam to an envelope already well secured by the common adhesive material. I do not mean to aflirm that letters secured by this double sealing are absolutely inviolable where art and skill are associatedwith dishonesty, but they present difficulties which in ordinary hands would infallibly betray the attempt.

The prevailing uncertaintg as to the great question of peace or war weighs heavily upon all branches of comnmerco at this side of the Channel. MIarkets for every kind of produce have 'oen wofully depressed .since the first announcement of the acceptance by Russia of the five propositions; and the corn and cattle trades which had, up to this stage, reached the ma2inmum point of prospe. rity, as suddenly sunk to their ordinary level. One of tho country jouirnals (the Wa4teford NQices of yesterday) thus reports the state of the niaikets in that district:- " For almost evoey uticle*of produce thoro is'a dull and aluggish,domand. * On yesterday,' said a flour dealer to us, IIwent among tho bakers of tho town to tryto make a few sales, but could sell nothing, not even a single sackthey won't buy onlyfrom hand to mouth.' The fannmers, i like manner, find a difficulty of sale, for we observo them in company with local salesmen-or ' penny-buyers' as they are caicd-hunting up thc merchants at their private residencs with the, view of making, or, porhaps we slould rather say, pushing sales. But, whether at honio or in tho market, th imiercliants seem quite careless abouat addling to their stocks. A few days, however, mnay cause a change either ono way or tho other-the present month (February) will bo likely to seo prices much higher, or, on the other hand, considerably ower. At present, with a dro imgmaarket, neither farmer nor merchant is disposed to sell; but time vwll come when mnost-of them will havo to comoup totthc mark-will have toexchangetheirgoodsforbanknots Somo people think that an, immediate peCeO would throw many persons out of employment and disarrango trado generally. That may be. But we know that numerous persons, though in employment on small wages;, can hardly sustain themselves. look at the inereasing numbers going into tho poorhouses -of the country every week. With bread at 9d. and 10d. the 41b.-loaf, how can a poor family of six be supported on a dozen ar even two dozen pence a-day, the former wages more generally received than the latter? And it is a great mistake to think that employersparticularly in town-can raise the wages of their men proportionato with tho highrrices of provisions. To-general nsineum very often dumnishes rather than increases with high prices. For instance, a highly respectable and e.ten. sivO shopkeeper in tho city informs us that the bare expenso of supporting his houso in food, &c. for tho last 12 months, exceeded the previous 12 montls by nearly 3001. The war has got up the price not only of bread, but of tea, sugar, whisky, meat, soap, candles-and in short nearly even article in general corsnmption. In fact all, or nearly all people earned, went for food-for the bare necessaris of iife. We are not now speaking of the income-tazx and its paralyzing effects upon industry. In short-and the present depressed state of business shows it-enormously high -prces aro bad for every one-merchant, farmer, shopkeepe and mcchanic.

While in most quirters of the country complaints are rife with respect to the present depression of trade and commerce, one of the papers published in the far west-the BalUinu Herald-mentions, among the many SigntS of returning Irish prosperity, as not the least si icant,theratprecedentedlygreatnumber of marrmages which are taking place previous to the commtenemuent of Lent and the temporaryclose of the wedlock season :- "' Our rural populatiou seem one and all to have resolved against single blessidness, and, induced by the unwonted success of their last year's agicultural pursTits, determined on venturing out on the uncertain sca of matrimony. We heard of no less than 12 marriages taling place in one day in a neighbouring parish, performed by one clergyman, and the reports from other districts are not less satisfac- T'his extraordinary rise in the mariage market will of course favourably affect the incomes of the Roman Catholic clergy, whose revenues derived from this source had been all biut cut off during the long and dreary years which followed the great f3ilure of the potato crop in 1845-6. . - TIIE T H LAN'D IEVOLOTxIM'.

TheDublinMelacetileAdvertise,s,ofthisday, says," The severe srutiny exeroised this season into the quality, cure, and make-up of the Admnirulty provisions, contract, and the consequent rejections, have created much oxcitement, not merely among the provision merchants of C,ork, but namong the general commercial xpublic of that city, and the consequences to the former threaten to be ve serious. Some facts that have come under our notice, with regard to this scrutiny, are, to say the least of them, sirgilar. For instance, 150 tierces of Pork made nu in Dablin were rejected on the ground of defective casks, the quaality of the meat being well approved. Bat on Deing presented again in unexceptionable casls, it was again-the very'same pork-rejected on the romund that it did not come up to the standard of quality! Other rejections of. Dublin provisions have taken place without any ground of complaint against casks, or cure, or quality, but against the manner in which the stuff had been saved-a mnner which the inspectors themselves have admitted to be harmless, and which has always till now succeeded fully; but they (the inspectors) must obey their instractions.
