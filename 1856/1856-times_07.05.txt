The report then adverts tbo the nomatu ofwthe bius promoted in the sessionl of 1855, and sates that it would be reoluected that ind uso, the ostdon and South-Western Railway Company opposed a bing promoted by the Greiat Wester and Bristol and Exeter Railway Companies for a railway termed the Devon and Dorset Rilwayc ; and that this Ill was thrown out by theoliouse of Commaons, upon a pledge einug given by tehe London andeSouth-Western Railway Coin y that they would introduce a hill in the following sasmon for a con: tinuation of thoir linetoExeter. But having obtainecdtheii object, the iondon and South-Western Railvay Company repudiated thir ledge. Consequently, ihen the company brought forwar a h ill for other objects in 1855, therouse of Comnmons referred the consideration of thd hill to a committee of nearly the same members to whom the Devon and Dorset Railway Bill had been referred in 1853. This committee inserted clauses into their bill, by which the compy were bound, under the penalty of a steopage oftheir rdividends, to introduce into and use their best endeavours to pass through Parliament a bill for a narrow gauge line to Exeter. With regard to level crossigs proposed in ralway bMils the report states that in considerifng the sabject it is necessary to bear in mind that level crossings are a source of danger, and that as miany as 35 people unconnectedl with the railways were kiled at level crossings and sx persons were injured during thenear 1855. It may also be observed that level crossings ental a considerable permanent expense on a railway company, f& om thewnecesnty of maintaining signals, lodges, gates, and gatekeepers. It was, however, impossible to frame any rules by v hes, h the inspecting officers coult be exclusively gided in naki7ng their reports, as each case involved many pial circuinstabces; but they enbeavoqu ed as far as pmsbicNe to adhere to the following general principles, viz. : rn 1. That in all cases where the engineering difficulties would he slight, so that the expense of erecting a bridge would notf aterially iff,r fromithes um of thecost of o Siding and -the capitalization of the annual cost of maitai ing signals,jodges, gates, and gatekeepers, the level crossing should net be recommended, unless the erection of a bridge would, from the general nafure of the district, sensibly interfere wtith the local traTis. 2. That inL cases of unimtportant roads, -where the engineering difficultiessmdexpenses entailed by abridge would be considerable, the level crossing should be recommended. 3.

.RYSTAL PALACE CONCERTS. Another magnificent day saw another crowded and brilliant audience assembled in the P.slace at Sydenham, yesterday afternoon, to listen to another capital concert-the eighth, and one of the -very best of the series. It is evident that the nearer these performances draw towards an end the rnore anxious are the public to be present. The first piece in the programme-Weber's fine overture. heRule,- of the Spirits-was nobly executed by the baud and again gave occasion to praise the arrangements which have made this temporary concert-hall so excellent a mediumi for sound. Itisno little to say in favour of the projectors that what seemed at one time impossible has been thoroughly accomplished. After avapid specimen of mnsical declamation from Eaydn's Creation, " Rolling in foaming billows"-which no one can deliver with more emphasis and point than Herr Fonnes-and the dnet from L'Rlisir f'Arezr4 "V Venti scudi," where the amorous Belcore enlists his unsus;pectingivaL Nemorino (song by Sigors Gardoni and Tagliafiee), the madrigal of Morley-." Fire, fire, my heart," remarkably well given (as usual) by the chorus of thc Royal Italian Opera, was honoured by a loud encore. As we have already hinted, madrigals are in vogue at these concerts; and more of them might be introduced, to the general satisfaction. Mademoiselle Rosa Devries then gave the well-known (we might say, but for its genuine beauty, 7haceyed) cavatina, "RKobert toi aue j'aime," in a style that, but for certain changes andonibellishsents of doubtful taste, and not in keeping with Mteyerbeer's music, would have called fcr unqualHied approval. The charmine duet from the Proph6t,-"--Della Mora," for Berta and Fides-came next. Tlis, with one reservation, was extremely well executed by Mademoiselle Marea and Madame Nantier Didiee. Our objection applies to the final cadenza, in which occurs an ascending scale in thirds. This species of tralt d'ensen2bte should, so to sueak, be measured out and accentuated by the singers, in such a manner, however, as to give no sensible impression of methodical rigidity-which, nevertheless, under any circumstancez, would be preferable to the hesitation and uncertainty exhibited in the present instance. The air of the Podesta, from La Ga=ra Ladrla--" 11 mio piano"-although occasionally a little fat, wvas otherwise admirably vocalized by Signor Ronconi, who displayed that peculiar fluency of utterance for which he is famous. The glorious sestetto from Don Giovanni, "Solas ola"-executed by Mesdames Bosio, Devries, and MarmL, 3M. Gardoni, Polonini and Fosimes-was a musical treat of the highest ozder-like the scene from 3Mendelssohn's Lo-rdey, produced at a recent concert. Why is it that the dramatic compositions of Mozart lose little or nothing in being transplanted from the stage to the concert-room ?-Simply because, in addition to their scenic propriety, they abound in the essential elements of pure and "absolute' music, and spring from ideas and melodies upon which time can exert no influence. The first of these conditions would be urged by the advocates of the school of "the Future" as an argument against the applicability of Mozart's music to the ends of the drama-to which, however, there is an awkward retort-viz., that Dos Giovannli, Figas-, and D;e Zaubcsflbtc have kept the stage for nearly a century-, and afford even more delight now than hen they were first given to the world by their iimmortal composer. The second part opened with ddat. The overture was Rossini's to La Gazza Ladrad-one of the most vigorous andpicturesqueof hisoperatiopreludes. Thiswasencored with acclamations. A finerperformance has seldom been heard. The various nuances were indicated by the bfton of Mr. Costa, and obeyed by the performers with a ecrapulous minuteness and attention worthy of all praise. Every player, from the fir3t violin "d'attaque" to the drams, did hisduty. Itwasatrimph,bindeed, for the hand and its experienced chief. anld it as worth adding that the over- f8owas quite as well played, and quite as7 keenly enjoyed, the second time as tho first. These fine orchestral performanca, and the impression they produce, convince us more and more that at least one symphony-by Mozart, Beethoven, or Mlendelssohn-might safelybe ventured on. for the honour of the art, before the Crystal Palace concerts are terminated. The pretty and sentimental terzetto from Rossini's Oulio-'" '1E perli Pamore "-sung by Gr-si, Gardoni, and Tagliafico, wras also encored; and a similar conmpliment was earned and well-merited by Madamo Nantier Didi e, in the very graceful air d' invitations of Ur:oain, from the Huguenots, -which was sung by that clever lady with all the " oquettc-ie" belonging to the personage and the situation, and only -wanted the page's costue to be perf-ect. Encores seemed now the order, oÂ£ the day, since another immediately succeeded. This w as accorded, .-nd wvith strict justice, to MIadame Basin and SignorRotenconi for their inimitably spirited performance of one of the duets betwveen Adlisa end Belcore" Quanta amore" (L'Elis-i,' d'sos-e-wbhich recalled the best days of Persi am and Ilablache. Nothing could surpass the vivacity andW hunsonr oi Xonconi, while aething could be marce brilliant and fascinating t.han the singingr of Madamte Bosio. The audien ce wvere enchanted. The barytone air of the King, from La Faroriia, "Vien leonora," although it displayed to advantage in the andante the splendid voice of Signor Graziani (who,accordingtothe received but erroneous cust nm, took the allcyro too quick), canme somewhat tamely after this quasi-t.heatrical and wonderfuly effective exhibition; and it was not till the racy duet from Don Pasquale, for Norina, and Doctor Malatesta -"' Pronts lo son"-wvhlch was acted and sung to perfection by Grisi and Ronconi, that the attention of the audience was once more excited. This, too, was unanimously encored. Such miusic, and a good deal more of the same character by Donizetti, is written and coneeived in the genuine buffo style-a style which, in the music of the Italian composers, has undergone fewer transformations than any other. The comic duets of Galuppi, for example, might even now be sung, in ai greAt many instances, without danger of anything-except their orchestration-being condenined .s peculiarly old-fashioned; and vet his ssrious music and that of the majority of his contenpararies, would be found insupportable. - The concert euded well, with the piquant end animatedfinaleto the first act of II Conlc tV Ory. Whlynot try, for a change, bythe way, one or two of the concerted pieces of Meyerbeer, from the* Huguenols, BRobert the Prophte, or L'Etoile clu YeordThey would afford a pleasant variety. It was remiarked at this concert, even more thbn at any of its'precursors, that the chbiring of birds, among the ied rf o that conxfer s 50 specala charm, and engendes- a fing of such delightful freshness, in the interior of the Orysta Palace. was5 almost incessant-so unch so, that it filled sw in a great meaisure the intervals of the music, and yet mano way prcgndiced its effect, even durin ,the softest passages.

2OLTYIPIC TiEATPXE. A new duodramn, with more of the 4-S cornice than i usually to be found in su,ch productions, has been, brought out at this theatre, with the title-A Cosjziga? Lesson. ;Mr. Lullaby is a gentleman who, having Joined the club of " Frolicksoine Oysters," is addictedi to late hours, much to the annoyance of his better half. When the curtain sises and discovers his chamnber one of his too frequent jovialities has just taken. place. He returns home smelling strongly of smoke and slightly elevaited by liquor, and in this condition receives a severe lecture, in the Caudle style, from the lips of Ms. I3llaby. He succeeds, however, in effecting a retreat to bed, and soon the admonitions of the lady are simply answered by snores. Eloquenco being no longer of use, she begins to riummage the coat-pocket of the delinquent, and therein finds a mysterious pocketbook, containing notes to the amount -of , a cigar, and I letter that apparently indicates a Zieison. with some figura'"c of the opera. The banknotes she puts in a drawer aslawfulprize of war, but with rspect to the billet she desires further informuttion, and rouses up tho, sleeping Lullaby, that he may afford it. S htly frightened, and dreadfully sleepy, the artful little gentleman contrive& to give his wife a glass of water, with a few drops of laudanum in it, and under the infinenue of the nmacotic she quietly slumbers i her armchair. But now3moral justice begins to asssrt itself; the article.; N.,hich have been turned. out of the coat-pocket are unlknown to Lullaby, and he sees in then proofs that some prodigate visitor has invaded his domicle. Mrs. Lullaby saccordinglywakened upintnrn, a violent altercation ensues, and she rushes from the room determined to Lrrite to her mother, when, from a window over the way, comes the voicebofLllshy's hestfiriend BrownL -his companion at the "h'reicksome OysterP-statingthat esch of them has-put on the other's coat, and requesting lullaby to aiid in repsiring the mistae. A exchasge is effected by pitching the coats fromwindow to window across the road; and we now undarstad why thesmtarticles should appear equally alrming to r r. Lullaby. The foundation of a better undersandig between the fond couple is now isia, for, although Mr. Lullaby's jealous fire receives fresh fuel from the discovery of the banknotes in his wife's drawer, bisuneasnesa is calmed by the resuscitation of Browns voiceo demanding the pocketbook, wliilei the story of theexchanged coats banishes the suspicion of Mrs. Lullaby. Another letter that has fallen out in the rumuage re-ear. thefactthatBrownis a,fllain, and clecoysaLulby fromnhome that she may be exposed to the rilawful addresses of ax immoral friend. Lullaby, by wa:r of renge, breiks the opposite window withtsome halfpence before he 7itche. out the pocketbook, and has thu further satisfaction of seeing tlhat -valuable article fall intl) the nijiddle of the road, where it is pick ed up by a eossing-sweeper, -the Nemesit of the wicked Brown.

TO THE BDITOP. OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It was my misfortune to write a certain popular song, entitled "The Low-backed Car"-I say misfortnme, for it has tumbled me into a heap of troubles. At first my car went ahead, but Pegasus, offended perhaps at being yoked to so humble a vehicle, backed me into the. law eourts. After escaping the dangers there a new danger awaited me in the courts of criticism, for the musical critic of the AtlAencum, having plunged over.hastily into some speculations as to whether the songs published in my. name are composed by me or not, subsequently dealt uncandidly with my own evidence, as given on the trial at law, to support his own hypothesis, and to insinuateagainst me the shabby crime of falae pretence. I addressed a letter to the Athemneas, complaining of and defending myself against this charge, but portions of that letter wrere garbled, and some suppressed altogether, and the original injustice of which I complained was aggravated by the u/n- founded comments made by the Athcenmun. on my remonsitrance. To contend fusrther with so unfair a n adversary :.nhia own colulmns would be w orse than useless; I therefore appeal, S3ir, to you, and that chivalrons snirit which characterires 2VLc Times as the champion of the vsonged, to grant methe privilege of anarnswer in yOUr. The critic of the A tacr.umm, shirking the question in dispute, assumes the ironical, declaring I should be conten that my injured namse appears in illustrious and equally illused company, but I haveno ambition to be maligned with 3ioore, or renowned im the musical martyrology of the Finally, says the critic, "if we were as ill-natured as Mlr. Lover assumes that we are, we might ask what becomes of Mr. Lover's farme ais a melodist w hen the credit of ' Rory O'Mlore,' 'The Low-backed Car,' and " The ngel's Whispr is restored to the trne owners;" The critic's discLaimer of ill-nature, taken with what follows, is very like a hull, but I can take the sting out of this goodnatredquetioby the simple truth. Ineyer claimed tearoftee songs, therefore there is nothing to " restore," and I am content with the fact of having written these wrords, as it wras :oy words that gave celebrity to airs before unknown. If I have not the fame of having written those melodies, I have the better fame of being too honour-~ able to claim what is not my own. *But my reputation as a melodist does not depend on those sar merely- let "Mlolly Bawn," " The Laud of the West," "Wlidow 1iachree," and some score of other popular songs answer for me, I am, Sir, writh great respect, Your obedient servant. SAMUEL Ov-ER. I Banes July 2.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I knowyourindependenc is such that you would not sanction a hardship, though your own advertising columns had been the cause of it. In January last an advertisement appeared in your papr, headed " Secretary Wanted." I came to london, and, having put in my appearance as directed, I was told that Mr. - (a solicitor) was engaged on a heavv case and could not be seen for several days. This was on a Saturday, and, having taken a " return " ticket, I was obliged to go home on the following Monday; this journey and hotel expenses cost me 21. 5s. On Monday last another advertisement appeared, headed ina similar way, saying that the governors of a certain institution would meet on Wednesday, the 30th inst., &c., after which announcementyou will find these words:-" In the meantime information may be obtained of the hon. secretary, . P. .. Palace-road, Lambeth." Once more I have travelled 198 miles hither, and on going this day to the house as above partially indicated, I was told by a woman servant that Mdr. G- was gone out for a month ' I then inquired if the clerk could give me the neceasar7 particulars, and the reply was, " He has a week's holyday, and will not be homne till Tuesday next." As I cannot remain in town owing to other engagements, I am thus mulct of the expenses of a second vist to London for nothing. I am sure you will say this is not fair dealing. Another 2U. 5s., besides loss of time, entirely sacrificed. Is it a London "dodge," or a bond ftde transaction? I am. Sir. yours. &c. EPSILON.
INCMDENTS AT THE CANM AT BALTSCELK.-TO render the recurrence of the miseries endured by our army intheCrimea.from short rations impossible the Government established at several points within easy distance of the Crimea depOts of horses; bullocks, eheep, and other stores upon a scale of considerable magnitude. One of these depOts was formed et BaltcEiik, a few miles from Varna, and a detachment of the Land Transport Corps, of the Turkish Contingent, commanded by a few Englsh officers, was stationed there as a guard, and appeared to obtain for themselves the goodwill of tho people of the country. Lately, however, atrocities of the most revolting character have been perpetrated by them on the soldiers and officers of the force in charge of the depot, and within a few dayspriorto thedate of ourcorrespondent's letter (the 10th of June) no less than four murders had taken place. One victim to the cowardly and murderous attacks of these bloodthirsty villains was Mr. William Peirce, a lieutenant in the before-mentioned corps. On Thursday, the othof June, he left the camp, attended by one privateleading three horses, with the intention of going to Yarna. There not being any regular rced, they had to Proceed for some miles through the wood that lies hetween'arna and the camip; but, it being quite light (6 'clock in the morning), and they anticpating to complete the journey before noon, both Mr. Pelice and his attendant were unarmed. They had not, however, proceeded more than nine miles when the solder who was riding in the rear of his officer, observed a mn suddenly appear in a bush at the side of thepaththey 'were pursuing, and, simultaneously with the crack of a rifle, beheld Mrr. Peirce stretched lifeless on the ground. At once discerning that all hope of resistance would be futile, the soldier tbrew himself from his horse, and plunged into the brushwcod, followed by three musket balls discharged by the bandits. F.rtunately, this time their aim was erring, and the man escaped with much bodily fatigue to the seaside, and late in the day made his way back to the camp, where the melancholy news aroused, as might be anticipated, feelings of the deepest regret and indignation. Insftantly every man not on duty armed, mounted his horse, and galloped to the scene of the revolting murder. The body was found quite dead. the balIhaving entered his right breast in a position instantly to cause death. His pockets had been rifled, his watch taken, and the five horses stolen. The corpse was conveyed by some of the soldiers to Balschil-, and upon the return of those who scoured the country (though unsuccessfully) in search of the miscreants was buried there with full military honiours. Mr. Pierce was much beloved by his brother officers and the men of his company, who were at the time of the despatch of our correspondent's letter eager for the confirmation of a report that had reached them of the apprehension of four men vho there appeared to be little doubt were the actual murderers, as the horses were reportod to befound in their possession. Hardly had the camp recovered from the shock produced by the before-mentioned painul occurrence when ib was again plunged into still deeper gloom on the following Tuesday (June the 10th) by an event attended with equally fatal consequences, though the rcsultofaccident. Itappearsthat Mr. Elkes, the veteri- ary surgeen of the detachment, had afew days prior thothis date given a full-dress dinner to the officers in honour of his birthday, and among the guests was an old College friend named WVeston, who was so anxious to be present thathe ame from Ealaklava to the dinner. uts being scarce, 3r. Elkes and his friend bad to sleep in the same room, and from the insecurity that reigued around each had his arms by the aide of his bed. Beforeodaylihton themornimgof the l0th of June, ?r. Elkes, forsome causewhich will for evcc remain a mystery,got up and muoved about the hut, but it WalS too dark for lus~ friend to recognize him. Mr Weston said, "Elkes, there is some one in the room, and if they do not speak I will fire ," hut he made no reply. ML- Weston again called out, "Fred (meaning Mr. Elkes), I see the shadow of a man movirg in the room, and if he does not speak I will fire r' but still no answer. He fired, and the ball went through the heart of his friend, who fellexclaiming, " Oh, Weston, you have shot me through the beart," and never spoke more. The father of Mr. Weston is a clerk of high standing in the Bank of England, who will doubtless feel inset deeply the melancholy tidings. MWr. Weston is placed under arrest, though be will upon his trial be acquitted, as he is entirely free froni blame, an d appears to have exercised mu.ch forbearance n refrsining to fre so long, having the murderof xr. Peirce, which only occurred a. few days beforc, fresh in his memory.

LEGSILATiVE COUOiL OF INDIA The Earl of A LE IAWILE presented a petitiost from the landholders, planters,. merchkits, and othersn iterestd in the agoulture,commerce, and.trades of Bengal, prayingfor ca enlagement of the Legislative Council by the aMmission into it, by appointment of Het Maiesty or otherwise, of pewsons selected from, the Indian ,communities without distinotion of rece or creed., and to call the attention of the House to the exclusive and unsatisfactory constitution, of the existinz Legislative Council. The noble earl said that the Legislative Council was comosed exitiely of the servants cf -the Craown and df the East idia Company, thus cxelading all the natives ira 10,000 lEropeans. This council was as remarkable for its ignorance and inefficiency as for itis exclusiveness. Composed of a few officers of revenue and justice; it had to legislate for eight naitions withoutanyaszistsice fromthe native Powers. A few weeks ago he called attention to-the legislation of this council with regard to the Ia of Singapore. Hie had shown that their legislhtion had thrown the 'hole of the monetary system of the thriving settlements in the Straits of Mal cca into a state of the utmost cono fusion. It was impossible. inteed, to coneive the absurdities and follies perpetrated bv this counciL He had received a letter within tho last few days from a gentleman in India, stating that no act promulgated by the couhcil had given satil,faction, aod* that their proceedings had excited dismay, disgust, and opposition fromn all parties.

The Earl of SIIAFTESBURY presented a petition from Mr. Edward Shipley Ellis, of Leicester, worsted spinner, and memberof the town-council, which stated,- " That the effect of the exertions of the society (of which he is secretary) was to liberate upwards of 103 boys illegaUy employed 'in climbing' in the town ; but that it has since come to his knowledge that many of these children, so set at Lberty, have been transferred or sold by their parents to master sweeps in other edunties. ' That the sum is from 20s. to 25s. yearly, and frequently for five years. " That for thiBs mone r payment these children are a:bandoned by their parents, and made to follow a cruel, disg-ust ing, and illegal occupation. I That it is a fact, vithin the knowledge of your petitioner, that these children are transferred from one master sweep to another,and it is his conviction that there are no less than 3,000 of these pcor children employed at present in England, ' That your Pettioner having found from experience that the act 3d and 4th of Victoria, chap. 85, passed for the purposeof preventing tbeemploymentoof childrenin sweeping chimneys, does not effect the desired end, prays, therefore; that immediate steps le taken to amend die said act, and so terminate this disgraceful system of infant slavery." The noble earl said, there could be no doubt the act was very grossly evaded in iLU parts of the country, although in the metropolis, contain:ng a population of 2,500,000, it was duly observed. There wvas no reason whatever why the act should not be observed in every part of the kingdom, and its non-observance entailed upon children great cruelty and suffering. He would :not detain their lordships by a long narrative of aes of cisease and mutilation; it was Sufi cient to sany that mally children wrere crippled in early life and rendered wholly inciapable of earning a livelihood. It 'was manifest that while these children were handed over to absolute and unqualified slavery it was impossible they could receive the first rudiment-, of education, and that treatment of a most disgusting anderuelcharacter must have a depressig inflience on their moralfeelings. He hoped the verusnment would pay attention to the prayer of the petition, and take intto consideration the inefficiency of the act. (Hear.) DWELLINGS FOR THE LABOURING CLASSES (IRELAND) BILL The Marquis of CLANTRICA.RDE, in moving the second readin of this bill, saiI that, whatever alterations might be made incommittee, no objection could be urged against its principle. The Earl of DONO-UGHMORE approved the principle of the bill, but announced Ids intention or moving some amendments in committee, The bill was then rease a second time. EXCHEQ(UER BILLS (4,000,0001.) BILL. This bill was also readl a second time. DIVORCE AND r1TRIMON\AL CAUSES BIIL. This bill was read a third time. Upon the question that the bill do pass, The LORD CHANCELLOR.availed himself of the portunity to record his opinion upon the subject of tha proviso which had been introduced into the bisl on the presious evening. He shorld therefore move the omission of the proviso, although he, could not expect to be supported by many of their lordships. and he should not in that case trouble them to divide. The proviso to which he referred prohibited the intermarriage of persons who had been guilty of adultery. Priiizd facie such a prohibition might appear likey to deter persons from committing adultery, but he feared that, in fact, it woul,d be found to encourage that sin, and that in a g.eat majority of cases the gunilty man would be relieved and s. terrible punishment inflicted upon the guilty woman. There was a standing order of their lordships' House which required that in every biL for a divorce a clause prohibiting the intermarriage of the guilty persons shonldbe inserted, hut it, was felt to be so grievous a penalty upon the woman that it wasinvariablystruckout. Thepro viso which bad been introduced did not comply wvith the words of Scripture as iiiterpreted by the right rev. prdaltes on the previous evening, for it did not prohibit the. remarriage of the woman put aaway, but only applied to a particalar individual. He should therefore formally move the omission of the proviso, in order that his opinion upon the subject might be forsall.y recorded. The noble and learned lord's amendment was negatived andl the bill passed. DRAINAGE (PRIVA9'E ADVANCE) ACTM AMEND- MENT BELL. The report of amendments upon this bill wvs a3greed to. - CAMI BRIDGE UNIVERSITY BILL. The House went into committee upon this biL Clauses 1 to 5 were agreed to. Upon clause 6, Lord L7TTELTON moved an amendment to remove the restriction imposed by the clause as it stood, requiring the eight elected members of the Council of the Senate to be chosen from the electoral rolL Should that amendment be agreed to he should also uropose that the members of the senate should be required to be actually resident at the university, and, with that view, he would move that words similarto those in the 13th clause of the Oxford Aet be introduced. The LORD CHANCELLOR opposed the amendment, thinking it would involvre unnecesscry complications in the working of the bill. The amendment was negatived and the clause agreed to. Causes 7 to 30 were also agreed to with verbal amend- mnents. On clause 31, providing that the commissioners mayframne university statutes, L-ord LYTTELTON said, he could not at all see why Cambridge should be treated so diffdrently from Oaford in respect to the legislative powers given to the commissioners. In the Oxford Act no such general powers were given, but by the Cambridge Bill the comminssioners might, for a period of tvao years, frame statutes for any of the purposes mentioned in tllm preceediDg clauses, in case the umversity itself shoutld not have donso w,hdi not propse to take away that power, bu the l pro vided that only statutes passed byth comsinr affecting certain gifts or endowments should be laid before the Council of the Senate. He thought this limitation ought notto exit nd that all the statutes 'framed by the cm ssonlers shul be laid before this body. He therefore proposed the oimissi on from the clause of the worcls whichi restrcted the statutes to be so submitted to the Counci of the Senate to such " as shall be for the altering ormodifying any,of tile ilaid. trusts, statutes, or directions ausecing any gift or endowment held or e~njoyed by the universitg, or y any professor, lecturer, reader, preacher, or scholar therein, or the said endowmen'ts of Lady Sadler, or of the offices of ChrAtian Preacher and Christian Advocate, or of Williami Worts." The LO-RD CHANCELLOR opposed the amendment. After a few words from the Earl of PojyiS, their lordships divided,- For the amendment ... ... ... 51 Against it .. ... ... .. 26 Majority for thei amiendment . .. -25 The clause, as amendecl, was then agreed to. On clause 44, which ernacted that it should not be necessary to make a declaration or take an oath on matriculating or on taling a degree, Lord LYNDEHURST said, it was his intention to move an amendment by restoring the clause to the state in which, it wis originally proposed to the House of Commons. That clausewas altered in committee ; and the alteration was carried by a very small majority in a very small House. Their lordships would understand the effect of it. It was to; admit Dissenters from tbe church of England to the senate-that was, to the governing body of the university. -That body passed the laws of the university; it elected the council of the university.; it elected the ofc cers of the university, and among other officers those connected with relgion aud wth rtligious education.

But vith res Ietto"nature of the amesdmernt itself be. did sot wishtoelr .pon his- own opiniom, -He had,been much struck wit; oertain observations which he had understood to havebeen enied in anoShei jloac wntE regard to the amendment which.wai there carried. Thosb observations were that ths sffect ofthe-aenndment woiilad be to confer upoi Dissenteswho t6ok.the higher d 'greeca right of interference,in the affairs of the university anda: vote for members of Prsliament.

He opposed theamnendmnent, believing that it would teud to' ,impair the usefulness of: the university." Now, with those observations he entirely concurred. They were observations ascribed, and he believed justly ascribed, to a member of Her Majesty's Government, ihat member being the gentleman -*ho had charge o tWe bil in the other house of Parliament; and he thought thereforo that, taldng those observations in connexion with the fact that the vote in the other housee of Parliament was obtained by surprise, their. lordships would agree to.ate restoration of those words fm the clause which prented Dissenters from taking any isartin the government of the 'University of Cambridge -hwich had been expnnged in the other house of Parliament.- (Hear, bear.) the uoble and learned lord concludedbv moving, as an amendment, the restoration of certain words isithe clause, the effect of which 'was to prevent Dissenters taking part in she government of the uiversity. . . . *. The LORD CHNCELL,OR would admit thst it was true that such a restriction was contained in the biU which was before their lordships two years . ago, and also that the bill which had been introduced during the present sessi6n contained the words which-the noble and learne-d lod now wished to restore. For his owLn par. he should have been perfectly satisfied with the bill if those words had been retained, but. as they had been struck out by the House of Commons, he ventured to submit to their lord-kips, that unless it could be clearly sihown that their omission'creaWd any serioug evil, or gave riu to any real apprehensionof danger to the church of Esigland, jt would not be advantageous that upon a question of this description their lord-. shps should place themselve s in autagoniim with the other House of ParL;a nent. [Iord l yndhurst.-Tiiere is no iuch omi8sson in the4 Oxcford BilL] There was not; but still it would not be creditable to their-lordsips .to place themselves in antagonism *ith the bouse of Commons on the subject. It was only a fortnight back since an argument was pressed upon their loIrdships which appeared to him to be germane to the present question. The noble and learned lord opposite occupied the attention of their lordships for a length of time upon a quetion upon which he regretted to say that he was defeated, and the argument empiloyed by the noble inc learned lord ws singularly applicable to the present question. If it were not dangerous-and the noble end learned lord argued that it was not-to the Christian legislation of th country to admit Jews into Parliament, surely it could not he dangerous to the church of England character of the Uniiversty of Cambridge to admit Dissentersinto its Senate. Forhisownpalt, he believed that the adission of Dissenters would not be dangerous to the church of EnglandL butto the Disenters themselves. It had bad been said byapopular writer, Dissenters never remained so during two generations, and they would be more likely to become members of the established church than to induee members of the church to dissent from it. The Earl of DE RBY had great respect for the noble and learned lord, and also for rs. Barbould, but he did iot think that her opinion could be relied upon to guide the cecisions of their lordships. - He regretted that the noble end learned lord shbold have thought it necessary to rest bis argument upon the speech made by his noble andlearned friend on a previous occasion, to the effect that the admission of Jews would not endanger the Christian characteu-of the House of Commons. He could not tell- whether his roble and learned friend acutely felt the sarcasm, but he begged to remind the noble and learned lord that there were many members of their lordships' House who had not sgreed in that opinion, and vwho could consistently maintin that the exclusion of Dinsenters from the governing body was necessary to preserve the church of England character of the university. His noble and learned friend, on the present occasion, asked their lordships to do, and the Government to do, that whiclh both one and the other had declared would be most advantageous,- and to adhere to - a principle which they had established in the Oxford Bill. -He could not conceive upon what ground the noble anid learned Lord Chancellor could sanction the introduction of a bill to amendthe Oxford University Bill, and still less how the Govermment could econclUe themselves to adopting an important principle in one session of Parliament, and then to be ready in she following session to be gatided upon the subject by a chance m3jority of the House of Commons. Be would be most unwillingtoseetheir lordshipsin antagonism with the House of Comnmons, but upon an important principle their lordships would be departing frora their duty, if they consented to abandon thlt which they felt to be right for any such consideration. ]t so happened that in the piesent instance, not only w ere the Government antagonistic to the views which theyhad exrese two years ago, and ageain during the present year, hutt the HIouse of Commons had proved itself antagonistic to if self within the last two years. In the case of the Oxford Bill he Hose of Commons decided by a large majority, and wisely decided, in favour of theadmission of Dissenters to the 'university, but they decided also that they should not be admitted into the governing body. It was in fast the declarations repeatedly made inboth houses of Parliament to that effect, made and supported by the Government, which went far to reconcile themembersof the universitytothe proposedchange, because they felt that in retaining the church of England character of the university, they would ;receive the support of Parliament and of Her MIajesty's. Government. That principle had now been reversed in a thin House of 1S31 or 140 memhcers, and then by a small' msjority, a'.though it had beeni orogmnally agreed to by a Large majority in a House of no less thant 400 members. He wrouldi implore their lordships not to be guided in their decision by the feeling evinced by- . stolen vote of the l[ouse of Commons, nor by the willingness displaved by the Government to play fast and loose, but to adhere to tho principle which they h2d laid down, If the principle were right with regard to Oxford, it could not be wrong with respect to Cambridge; and he earnestly trusted that their lordahipsseould not permlit the Government to go back from the gronnd which they had adopted, and, out of consideration for a trifling majority. of the House oE Commons, to induee them to shrink from that course in a manner not creditable to their consistency. Lord MO1NTEAGLE considered that the bill as it at pre'sent stood was morec onsistent with wise legislation than it would be if altered in the way proposed. He maintained that from the earliest times there had been a wide difference between the 'University of Cambridge and that of Oxford with respect to. Dissenters. In the days of Elizabeih. at Cambridge, a Dissenter was not excluded from taking his degree or becomlg a member of the university. During the reign of James L. the authorities of the u,iversity were forced to do that which they would not have done, except under the compulsion of a monarch. who was not attached to the laws or liberties of England; but long after that inme the cases of Oxford and Cambridge entirely differed. The Dissenter, no doubt, had rcause of complaint in both universities; h ut at Cambridge the course of education was opened freely to him, although he might be refused his degree, whereas at Oxford there was a prohibition on matriculation, and the Dissenter was not admitted to the bcneflts of the same education which he enjoyed at the sister university. He contended, further, that there would be no analogy between the two unversities even if the noble andlearned lord succeeded in carrying his amendment. By the Oxford Bil aDissenter could take only a "B.A."degree. Bythepresentbill, even as amended by the noble and learned lord, he would be admitted at Cambridge to the "M.A." degree, although he would be excluded from the senate. 'the question had been put by the Lord Chancellor upon a right foundation. Could they - show any objection to the adimission of Dissenters except the cry of exclusion, which of all cries was, in his opinion, the one most abhorrent fromthe constitutionof England? What were they afraid of ? There wereabove 3,000 membersof the Eenate, and it was absurd to suppose that any real danger could arise to the church of England from the admission of a few Dissenters to that body. The experitnent had already been tried. Lr. Pitt, in 1793, without objection from tha then Protestant Parliament of Ireland, admitted both Dis: senters and Roman Catholies to the full enjoyment of the University of Dublin; and -he appealed to their lordships whether, wvhile the result of that experiment had furnished them with the best artgment against the nltramontane dcoctrines entertained by a portion af the Roman Catholic party in Ireland with respect to th 3system of united education, they had ever heard a complaitnt arising from the intermixture of the Roiman Catholcs with the Protestant-s? The Earl of DONhOUGHMORE remarked that Dissenters did notform part of the gcoverningbody of the Univer sity of Dublin. Lord MONTEAGLE was av are of that, but they tookthe so e de&ree as Churchmen, and voted for members of Parliament mn the same manner. Bat it was said that by previous dauses of the bill they Ilid admitted Dissenters to the advantages of the university by giving them halls. He regretted that they had done s3, because some incoilveniences, if not dangers, might arise from the establishment of smoall Dissenting communities representing the extreme and ex;clusive opinions of that body; w hereas if Dissenters were admitted fully, freely, and unreservedly to the university, the tendency would be of Dissenters towards the church. not of Churchmen towards Dissent. But he relied upcn authorities,andhe begge.dtheir lordships to observe that the argumentwhich he was about to quote was not founded upon any tempray ortrumpery ground, but upon eternal Drinciples which were at all time equally just andl true. The noble earl opposite (the Esrlof Derby), on the occasion of the presentation ef a ptition iite year1S32 said thathe was most confident that the church would not be strenÂ£gthned by keeping up the system xf exclusion at the universities. fshe noble e.rl then ex:presed an opinion that it was not by exclusion, but by admission, that the intereats of the church were best supportel. If those arguments were good then, they were equalygcod now. He could not-understand how the noble and leanied lord (Lyndhurst) could consistently advocate the admission of those who were not Christians to theLegislature of thi s country, tud at the samne Xi6ebjec tto the amiasi of aD nin: tians one of the -govein-g body of-the Unietri of- Gainbridge. (Hear, bear.) e could not -admit- that this aeration in the bi-m iU, . %rdiansthi i wvbk ,the vote waken was in -the hands, oE mambers.

HANKEY asked the Chancellor -of the Exchequer whether he intended this year to bring in a bill altering the present scale of allowances to clerks employed in the collection-of income-tax? The CHANCELLOPR of the EXCHEQUER did intend to introduce a bill for that purpose. COUNTY COURTS. MYr. GLADSTONE said, there was a bil standing for Monday next respecting County Courts, which was likely to place a considerable arnnal charge upon the consolidatcd fund. He wished to know whether his right hon. frierd would lay on the table an estimate of the probable amomut of that charge? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEEQUER promised to do so. The bill would not be brought on before next iFrsday. REGIMENTS IN TIHE WEST MDIES.

WILS AND ADMINISTRATIONS BIILL. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY asked whether the ChanceUor of the Exchequer would lay on the table a statemen' respecting the-amount likely to be placed-o the Consolidated Fend by this bill? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he had not heard the precise amount which would be imposeEd on the Consolidated Fe und by the measure, but he would coem.- muni&ate with the Solicitor-General on the subject. - .: BISHOPRIC OF NEW ZEALAND. On the motion that the Hoase at its rising do sdjourn till l]Wonday,- Sir J. PAEKTGTON rose to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether it was the intention of the Governinent to make any arrangement for restoring to the Bishop of N ew Zealand the moderate and necessary income of 600. per annnum whichwas provided for him when hefirst acceptea the position he had so wellfiled, and was continued till thb last two years. ' lIe said he could not allow the session to Ilese without putting a question on this subject, to 'which he had called the attention of the House on more than one occasion. His object was to ascertain what 'were the intertions of the Government'with respet to a state of thinos which they must allow was, on the whole, not creditablfi He was aware thatm former discussions on this subject blame had been - thrown on hin on account of some words which fell from hin in, 1852 in moving the colonial estimates. He had never acknowledged the justice of that censure ; bu1t supposing that he had in the first few weeks after assuming office used expressions when he moved the estimates, ani ws thinking more of the civil government of the colony; which woaYd apply to the Bishop of New Zeahnd, he had' auin and again disclaimed that such was his intention; and an accidental error - of that kind Iought not to be visited 'on the bishop. It waLs in. I9 or 1841 that the L Bishoip of New Zealanl 'was api. pointed, with. a distinct intimation that 6OOl, a-year -was ts behis income. No distinct promiise,. certainly. wasg mSdL that the income should be for life, but judging from all pre cedent it mightfairlybe deanmed tobe a life income, Within the lastt'wo yas, h6wrever. this income had beenl wholl y stopped. TIhe present Home Secret'ary, vrhen Colonial Secretary, mnade a refereitee to the colony on the subject;* but the colony refused to act on it.

" Sir . PAidgt on said, he was decidedly averse to inin any distinct plere t but, seeing the reduction already made in the vote, and that next year it wouldbe further reduced, iii was hoped to 5,0001., and thatater that time probably ise grat at all worddbe required on account of Newv Zeaand, he would sugges'I that it would be hardly reasoxable to divide against thei amount now proposed. "Ir. W. Williams sai d that, after the gratifying state. iMeat of the righti hon. gentleman, considerng thatthevoto. was now reduce(d to 10,000M., and would be only 5,OOO.L after which no grant would be required, he would not preso hlis amendment." Now, he confessedl he thought that wlhen a pledge of that sort wasi given sine years azo, and had been subsequently ated on, it would be nothaing but a bre:ch of faith to depart from it. Allusion had on a former occasion beem made to the No*rth American bishos, but they did noI stand on the same ground. The ecclesiastical establishmentof the North A merican colonies had alwys been defrayedl by the mother eountry. but this vote had bn consideredfrom the firt .as merely temporary. Every effort. had been made to induce the Legislature of New Zealaad to defray the salary of the bishop, but, while expressing thef highest respect and esteem for his eharacter andlaborsK, they had unifornly rerused to impose any charge on the colony in favour of any particular denomination. ie coulhi not believe that the churchmen of New Zealand would allow' the bishop to suffer any pecuniary loss, but, looking at al the circumstances of the case, he could not hold out any expectation that he should be prepared to recommend to Parlisment to provide his salary out of the revenues of thi% country. Mr. GLADSTDNOE said, he bad no objection to offer to the ourse hitherto adopted by the Government in this matter, inasmuch as he himself had some share oE responsibility for it. There could be no doubt thai the difficulty in which the Government was placed arose entirely out of the effect of the words used by the right hon. baronet, the member for Droitwich when Secretary of State for the Colonies. Those words constituted in themselves a distiet. pledge that the vote for the salary of the Bishop of NewZealand should not be renewed. and the Government wvhicl followed the Government of Lord Derby could not have, departed from that pledge without giving fair ground or Complaint to the House of Coimnons. There was, there. fore, nothing to fEId fault with in the conduct of the Government. Granting, however, that the right hon. baronet ihe member for Droitwich was not aware at the tine of thefull breadth of the engagement which his words implied, and that the Government wbhis folowedwas not bound to use its autthority to break that pledge; he had no hesitation in declaring--speakring as an independent member ofParliament-that the bishop had been harshly treated, and the present position of this question was not honour' able to the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) The bishop was not a mqn to come to that House in the cha5acter of a petitioner for remuneration (hear, hear); hea would prefer rather, like some of the early bishops, to work for his living with his cewn hands (hear, hear) ; but there could be no doubt that when he left this country, though he had no express stipulation, he had a fair title to expect the continuance of his salary. Where there was amoral obligation, though there might be noF written contract, the Rouse of Commons generally construeI it in the widest and most liberal mainer ; and it ertainly weighed greatly on his Conscience as a member of Parliamentthat this matter should stand asit did. No remedy could he applied without the general consent of the House, and it would be well to consider whether it would aot bew more consonant wvith the liberal principles on vw-ch the House usually acted in such matters, to encourage the Govermment to propose a renewal of this grant rather than tohold fast to the strict sense of the pledge which had been given by a former Government on tho subject. Mr. WIL=IAIS did not see why the Bishop of NewZealand should be quarteredupon the people of this conntry. Thanks to the liberality of the mother country, thecolonyof New Zealand was now in a most prosperous condition, and if the colonists wanted a bishop they ought to pay for him. themselves. (Hear.) He hoped that the right hon. baronet would never again come to the house to propose so unjust. and dishonest a tbing as that the people of this country should mcantain a bshop for New Zealand. lr. DISRAELI: did mot think that this wav a convenienit moment at which to enter into a discussion as to the princples upon which the colonial church shoild be supported. This particular question ought to be regarded as concerning .thclaim of an mdividual, and theonly oint to be decided was whether or nDt Parliament had made an engagement. with the Bishop of New Zealand which it had not fulfilled. If there were such an engagement he was sure that all -members of that House would be anxious that it should be carried out. Ms. own inipression had always bsere that the bishopric was accepted by rlr. Selwvn under the clear understanding that he should receivoan adequate and decorous support. His (Mr. Disraeli's) principal object in rising, however, was to show that his right hon. friend. (Sir J. Pakington) had given no sudh pledge as had been attributed to him, the supposed existence of whicl seemed to be the only obstacle to a liberal interpretation of the position of the Bishop of New Zealand. He was surprisedL to hear the right hon. gentleman the. member for the University of Oxford (Mr. Giaditone) speak of a diect pledge, because, on referring to tho only autherntic record of the proooedings of that House, he found 'hat " SirJohn Pimdngton said that he was decidedly averse, from iving ay cdstinct pledge." It seemed to him (Mr. Disrl) that after using these Words, it was impossble that his right hon. friend could have given any distinct pedge. What, however, were his after observations? He said that, "after the next year, probably no, grant at all woald be reonired." Surely, the - word "probable" wavs the vaguest that could be used, and it was a most ersoneous interpretation to say that his right hon. friend gave a distiact pledge to Parliament that no further ,vote of thes kind s.loufd be prop)sed. Sir G. GREY had no deswre to oppose the consideration7 of a Dy well-founded claim whicei the Bishop of New .land might have; but he rmust correct the miappre- hension of the right hon. gentleman opposite that the only obstace to the rer.ewal of this grant was a casual e.pres- 'aloe droppedin debate, withoms .sufficient consideratioon. b' oergt_ son - oaront th m -be fo Driwc (Sii. - 4' e ngt taa oafnet hc mlafor forroit itwc, S .adakington).

ERATum.-A straTage littlo error occurred in our report of Sir R. Bethells speech on Thursday evening. The Solicitor-General, after enumerating a number of obstacles to the passing of his bill, concluded by say- me that, after all, "Time" was his most formid-- aele enemy. Our compositors, at least as much accus. tomed to 2D5e Times as to "Time," confounded the twvo, and hence we, who ave already more than enough to answer for, are erroneously described as the chief obstacle to the passing of a bill with the principle of which we agree, howvever much wre may differ with Sir R.

From the statements of one of the men it appears that on the night of the 17th of June the briz was, as near as the captain aould discover, off the Western Islands, being bound from New York to Malaga with a- caro of pitch, tar, and tarpentine. The night was very. dar and the vessel was si;eeriagan E.N.E. course. Shortly after midnight she was rus into by the British brig Victoria of Liverpool, which cut hier to the water's edge, andsh almost immediately flled. The crew fortunately bad sn'3i cient time to reach the birk, and were immediately taken on board, the captain and crew of that vesselrendering everyassistance in picking up the unfortunate men. Directly afterwards the Columbia nank. The Victoria then put into Lisbon, where she landeql the shipwrecked sailors. .The mate was on watch at the time, and it is supposed that the man who&e duty it was to look out forward had fllen sleep.

V?ZONDON SATURDAY, JULY 5, 1856 Iu the Houlse of Lords last night, The Lo,D CnOnkN=Lon, on the thka readiug oI .the Divorce Bill, formally moved the omtison of the clause inserted the night before, forbidding the ireLnIagrri3e -of peron -who had been guilty of adultery. The noble Lord' imendet was negatives and the bill passed. The Housethenwent into comraittee on the Cainbridge Uaniversty BilL Lord LYNswusr moved au amendment -,o clause 44, which eiacted that it ihould not be necesary to make a declaration or to take an oath. either on matriculation or on taking a degree; Considering the close connexion which existed between the Univerities and the Church, he did not think that a clause which admitted Disenters to the University should ;tand part of the bill. He therefore proposed to recstore the cluse to its or'gil shape, which did.not admit Disenters. The LOUD C h&CMx.o thought that the only danger which could arise from the admiasson of Diasenters to:the University would be to the Disenters them lvegs, lstcontact-;wthChurchmen mignt result in their becoming members of the Establislied 1Church. - Lord Dzinr could not agree w.ith the Loan CHANCELLOR in this view of the question. He thought hie exclusion of Dhssente froni the governing body of the University was esmntial to the connexion which existed between that body and the Established Church. After some; further discussion, their Lordships di-dded, when the, numbers were,- For thLe amendment ... ... 72 Against it ... ... ... 25 M3tajority ... . ... 47 The remainiing clauses we:e then agreed to. Several other bills were forwarded-a stage, after which their 'Lordships adjourned. In the Ilouse of Commons, on the mQtion of adjournment till Monday, Sir J. PA cGTION inceuired, whether it was the intention of rthe Government to maake any arrangement for restoring to the Bishop of Niiw Zxan D the income of 60I. per annum which was provided for hm when he accepted the position, and was continued until the last two years. He put it, he said, to the House whether it was creditable to the Church or honourable to the co-ntry that-.this eminent person should be le-t in his high position without any income. Mr. LABoucERE said this was a subject whiel. he always approached with pain, for he felt that the bishop had been harshly dealtwitlh. Nothing could be mnore disinterested and highminded than the conduct of Dr. SELwyIW , and if he (Mr. LAJoucn=) came to the conclusion that he ought not to replace his salary upon the estimates it was not from any disrespect towards him. Finding thnat a distinct pledge had been given to the qouse three years ago by Sir J. PAF=GTON, when becretary for the Colonies, and which had been subsequently acted upon, nothing but the strongest ground would, in his opinion, justify the restoration of the grant, which would otherwise be a breach of faith. Mr. GLADsTroN did not object to the course taken bythe Government, who were placed in a difficulty arising from the effect of the words used by Sir J. P4AmeGTON, which, whether so intended or net, were 'understod as conveying a distinct pledge that the salary of the Bishop of N_w Zx&.Az should not be placed upon the estmates. The question, however, was whether the House of Cormmons, as English gentlemen, ina state ofi things which Sir J. xnGOri thought not creditable to the HEouse, and -when Mr. L&noucnxn was of opinion that thle bishop had been harshly treated, would not act more consistently with the rules of justice and equity by encouraging the Governmnent toR renewr the grant than by adhering to the letter of the Mredee. W. Warm could not understand upon whiat principle of cormmno honesty money should be taken out of the pockeis of the people of this coantry topsy a bishop of lew Zealand. If the people of tshaticoony wanted a bishop, he said let them pay for one. Mr. TbyAxn observed th ththe case ought to be looked at with reference to the claims of the individual. Htis impression 'was that Dr. Sxswvi had accepted the position upon the 'understanding that he would have a decorous and proper support, and that engagement ought to be fulfilled. The only real obstacle was an alleged pledge of Sir i. PAxTcON-; but Sir JoENi had stated that he -was "decidedly averse to givmig . distinct pledge," and had only mentioned the "probabilty, that no future grant would be required. The case should be regarded in tb's light of an engagement between Parliaolent nd at individual, -which should be udgecl by the rules oc? equity. Sir ua. GEY remark ed that, besides the speech of SiraJoePtlSeGTOsNi,the estimates prepared while he was ia ofvice contained a note expressir, a hope that no further aid would be askedTfor. MCr. lIOEBrCE thought, if the colony refused to pay the bishop, the person who appointed hinm (Lord J. Rbssale) should pay him. Sir J. Pr;TON~ must, he :said, have intended that the House Ahould understand thatwthe bishop's salary wouldd be no longer paid by this country. fr. HiuyxABD trusted that LJord Paase~thox would take the case of Dr. Srnwr, who had made a great sacrificel of worldly prospects, into consideration. The conversation upon this subject then tarn1binated. Some discussion took place respecting the case of the late paymas,ters of constabulary in Ireland, to which attention was called by Mfr. Seajeant O'Bhat , and the motion for the adjourment was agreed to. In reply to Mfr. tieersnw, Lord PAL.RsaspON saidit was reported that apprehensions had been entertained of disturbances on the Cape frontier, but he did not understand that there had been any actusl outbreak, and he beieved that precautions had been taken to guard against such an occurrence. Tuhe report of the Committee of Supply -was broughit up and agreedsto. The Church Building Colplc ion Biln was read a third time, and after a short debate uapon some proposed amendments, passed. On the order for going into Committee upon the Partnership Amendment (No.2) Bill, MIr. Mu-rz said the more he heard vad saw of ts bill, the worse it appeared. Inspted of a Partnership Anendanent Bill, it should be called a bill for promoting fraud, collusion, and robbery. The commercial world did not want it, anld he moved to defer the commmittee for si2 months.u b this amendment was opposed byMr. nso., er. W. BurcS, ildIr. nCommUC, ir. Is, and Mr. BxSS, and sapported by Mhr. SPOOte, up r. s e1pro Mr. Csossr, and Mr. G. Barr. Lord P~ssroKsasid the objections offered to thebilleremore fitfor discussion in committee. He believed that public opiniion was in favour of the bill, thinkPig that the law of partnership required alteration, and that the measure would tend to remove impedimentt3 to-the emIloyment of small amounts3 of capital. Thegreat opponents of the bill, he observed, were large capitalists and its advocates persons more conmected with the possessors of smll apitl; it was the few agaist the many; and this, he thogh, wvas, primr B facie, a recommendatioi of the bill. Mr. T. Bos no protested against a Minister of the bilowNendenvouring on such a subiect to e.ocite a prejudice agaiast capitalists. The matters in dils cusson, tie said, turned not upon details, but uipon questions affecting the principle of the measure, which tended, in his opinion, to shake commercial confidence. He was convinced that there was ;no want of capital, and he strongly objeed to the exclusion of publicity by the bill M Ir. M.xcsrm said, what he wanted to knopw before going into committee, was whether in oommittec it was intended to alopt the provisions against fraud embodied in the Joint-stock CoM- paniei Bill-Unamely, dU registration of oa1r erhipa em w comsizandit!e. - SirJ. Gn Stj concurred with M r. MnIraUL, upon the answer to whose inqui y, he sd, hiM vote would depend. 'This bi U opposed tothe r eports of a cmmission and of two committees, and reated 'upon evidence ithe condition of whic, naely, publicity, it- did not fulfil. The whole of the mat ter turned upon that safeguard. MIr. Lows said the bill did not deal witi Part-. nerships, propr.y so called. It was not a bi for altering the law of- partnership; it wasa omplement of theUsury Law, regulating the liability on which money might be advanced. The questio L of safeguards was a difficult one; if there were too many, the bill wouild nnt work, andl the question how mtch safeguard could be introcluced ons iteatly with its due working depended, not upon
The Turkish empire has been, we are told, received into the family of nations. Its Sovereign is no longer a potentate seated on a throne apart, to be approached only by formal embassies, or to be coaxed, threatened, or deceived by any European.State, without the world deeming it legitimate to interfere. The great Powers have established with regard to the Ottoman dominions a principle analogous to the AlIuo doctrine in the New World. These regions are declared to be no longer lawful fields for conquest, or even annexation by consent. Austria must pause on the Adriatic and the Danube, Russia must give up the march to Constantinople, France must not think of Tunis, and England must limit herself to commercial operations on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates. Turkey is taken out of the same category as Tartary, China, or the Indian Archipelago, and admitted to all the rights Which belong to European nations. This change is more important than seems to be generally recognized. It has often happened that the enterprising and warlike States of Europe have agreed, through mutual jealousy, to respect some territory beyond the limits of their own system, but this is the first time in their history that they have recognized the equality of a non-Christian State. International law, which grew up under the shelter iof the Papacy, never contemplated the existence of pagan nations wvith rights reciprocal to those of the Christian communities, and the grants which IRome made of the Indies to Spain and Portugal w7ere only the natural result of a theory which did not conceive sovereign rights to belong to any ruler beyond the pale of the Church. The conquering nations of the last two centuries bave been Protestanis rather than Papists, yet enough of the old principle has remained to make a great difference in the eyes of moralists between the subjugation of Mahomedan cr Hindoo dynasties. and a trespass on the xights of Poles, Spaniards, or Italians. Now, however, almost blindly, through the course of events, we have accomplished a revolution in the highest of all law-the law of nations. The equality which the SuLTA has given to his :Rayahs is as nothing to the equality which the Christian world has given to the infidel. For the first time in history a pagan State is received as a constituent part of the Christian comnnaonwealtb. To use the phraseology current in the discussions of a domestic question, 3alahomedans will legislate for Christian nations and Christian churches. For, be it observed, the rights of Turkey are now quite reciprocal to those of the other Powers; the SuLTN is on the samo footing as the Emperor of the FRENcH or the sing of PRUSSIA, and in any future complications the signature of his Plenipotentiaries may be found attached to treaties determining the sdatus of the POPE of Rome, or his mediation may be tendered to moderate the conflicts of Catholics and lutherans in some German State. It is but natural th-at when things have gone so far there should be a desire to revise the relations in which the SoTAN stands to Europeans within ls own territory. We are not surprised, therefore, to hear that the "capitulations" to which we have more than once dawn attention are about to receive a revision. If the SuiTAN'S Goverment be fit to have jurisdiction in thte affairs of Europe, it must certainly be held fit to administer justice to the sojourners within its own frontiers. In the days when F'OIs Tli: '- F rT courted tile favour of SuunDsmx it wis thought a great coricession that some Frank xmerciants should be allowed to live at Pera, under the protection of the French Ambassador, much in the same humble guise that the first English traders established their factories in the territory of the Moguls. Yet there was a kind of intolerance on both sides. The Christian could not conceive it possible to be subject to Mussulman law, while the Mahomedan admitted the Frankish representatives and their clients to manage their little affairs ir. their own manner. As to crimes of violence being com7mitted-by a Frank on a Mussulman, the idea probably never entered the mind of Sultan or Vizier. We know now how all this is changed. The most desperate ruffians of Southern -Europe are in Turkey under British, Austrian, French, or Greek protection, We give impunity to Ionians and Maltese; Austria has her Croats; FrenclT\ passports screen a crowd of Levanfines, whose professed attachment to Catholicism is allowed to be the cloak to any knavery; while Greece and Naples send, a contingent, whose character may be easily imagined. While the worst of these have protection for delinquencies, the whole enjoy immunities of the most unjust kind. They can only be sued in'the consular courts of their own country. They pay less taxes than their neighbours, and in some places none at alL They are wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the PomTE, while for all claims on the Government or on Turkdsh subjects they can bring into play the whole; machinery of their embassy. Each representative is almost bound to make every private complaint an affair of State, and, in fact, the real or nominal Austrian, Briton, or Frenchman practically turns the diplomatists of his Sovereign into his own special attorneys whenever he pleases. But this is not all. If we were only interested in our own countrymen or in our Western allies, we might rest content with hearing that Europeans had a little more liberty than they deserved, and that the chief sufferers were the Turks, their state, and dignity. But both our, interest and our new treaties bid us treat the SuTANr and his subjects as we treat Frenchmen or Germans, or wish to be treated ourselves. The exemptions conferred by the " capitulations' render all improvement almost impossible in- Turkey. Their practical working is to double the oppression on the poor by giving undue immunity to the rich. Every Christian merchant, for instance, wlho has gained a certain position obtains a foreign passport. Re thus escapes not only the tyranny of native rule, but even the proper obligations of a subject. Thus those who mightotherwse have an interest in improving the political state of the country become regardless of it as soon as they are Frenchmen or Austrians, while the Turks care not to amend and mitigate their administration, since they feel sure that every man who is subject to it cannot but be a poor, unfriended, piastreless outcast, unable to purchase the protection of a foreign embassy. What hope is there of improvement when every man hastens to shake off his- allegiance, to attend the receptions of foreign diplomatists, and to proclaim that he and his are merely strangers dcwelling in the land? In fact, there can be no spirit of patriotism among those -who have been subjected for life to such feelings. Turks, Greeks, and Levantines are taught to feel that they are merely encamped in the country. Enterprise languishes, public works receive no private sup- port, and the only feeling, except the love of. money, which can be said to exist, is the bitter brooding fanaticism which we have learnt to connect with Christianity in the East., We may rejoice, then, to learn that - the "capitulation!' system is about to be modified; but -we can scarcely contemplate the full effect of its abolition. Never have Enropeans entertained the idea of living under the unrestricted working of Mfahomedan law. Wherever they have wandered they have always instinctively interposed some kind of barrier between themselves and a system to them unknown, terrible, and impious. They have, as a matter of course, organized themselves into a community, and obtained certain definite rights before establishing themselves in a non-Christian country, and they have remained apart, in it, but not of it. This may, indeed, be partly the result of unfounded prejudice, but it must be allowed to be partly based on principles not to be eradicated from the nature of the two religions. After all, the Mussulman or the Hindoo must, as far as we can see, remain separated firom the European by a deep gulf. A Nestorian or a Copt in the depths of the wilderness has more in common with us than the most civilized Pasha in Stamboul. We feel this, and the less educated Oriental feels it more. Thus, then, we may look with interest on the great work which Europe has undertaken to accomplish,-the admission of Turkey,and, on analogous principles, other non-Christian monarchies, into the fellowship of nations, and the extension to their rulers of full sovereign and executive rights over Christian men. Both things are new in the history of the world. An old system has been broken up, a great attempt at fusion is made. The result time alone can show.
Among the many illustrations which history has preserved of the power and magnificence of Rome few are so well calculated to fire the imagination as the reciprocal relations of her dependent pro'vinces and protecting patricians. That commonwealth was indeed a mighty State whose nobles were singly courted for their advocacy in the great Council of National Iegislation and Appeal, and vhose protectorate was sought fer by provinces which comprehended the subjugated remains of emonarchies, tyrannies, and republiEcs. Whatever we may talk or think of 3English greatnews, it is not likely that provinces rich as old Bithynia or islands possessing the historical traditions of Sicily and Cyprus will ever buy with largesses and prostration the protectorate of the houses of SuTrnA.sD and DEVONSnME. Tnat oppressive majesty which invests each patrician of the conquering country with more than proconsular attributes, and that national indifference which leaves to the consideration of a few families the - fate of dependent millions, are each unlknown and would be deemed intolerable in an age which boasts to have elevated the species at the cost of the individual man. But; although this cannot be done exactly as it was done by another -people in another agealthough we cannot imitate literally the magnificent despotism of ancient Rome, yet we may be doomed to see a travestie of that senatorial beneficence which not unfrequently relieved the avarice or cruelty from which the FAsir and MtoELTTr were not exempt. The only and obvious parallel that can be sugi gested between- a province of ancient Rome and a dependency of modern Britain is presented by our Indian relations. A people twenty times as uumerous as ourselves, held in ostensible or ill-disguised subjection under British Proconsuls, approaches, if it does not approximate, tq the character of a Roman province. The comparison, we are happy to believe, is very much on the side of our own subjects. We assert with confidence that never was a conquered race more fairly, justily, and humanely treated by the conquering race than the people of our Indian possessions are by ourselves. But it is not in the nature of human events or human dispositions that such relations should subsist entirely without abuse of power on the one side, or aome murmur of complaint on the other. It would be not, only strange but unnatural if all were the perfection of authority here and the perfection of contentment- there. Sufficient for our humanity and our good name if we- have made justice and benevolence- the rule of our government, injustice and cruelty the rare exceptions. And thi, we repeat, we believe that we have done. It is-as Mr. M3ACoAtAY long ago remarked-it is upon this faith in our general justice and truth-the coivictioni that our " Yea"' is "Yea?' and our " N ay" 'Nay"-that what we promise we will perform, what we threaten we will;inflict, what we repudiate or condemn we will forego-it is upon this belief, deeply seated in the Oriental heart, that our mnoral empire in the: East is founded; and whatever shakes this belief will shake that empire al-o. But it is fated that offences should come. It is a primary law of our nature. . And when they do come-even though not through our own faultwe must either take or inflict the consequences. Hitherto, since the time (if WARRN HsTINGS, the natives of India have -'suffered no wronTg great enough to provoke an appeal to any but the ordinary tribunals. - The laws under which they live have fer the most part provided a sufficient legal remedy here for their faulty or erring administration there. Up till recently they have sufficed to heal the wounds which they have inflicted. But now a different -precedent seems to be in process of being established; and, if it is, we are sure that it will not be without imitation. A new order of Indiani appellants is coming into the field. They are not over-taxed zemindars, nor over-rackrented ryots, nor duped and plundezed merchants. In a word, they are not of that c1ass which is generally supposed to furnish the most numerous and the most oppressed suppliants for redress. On the contrary, they are princes, either disinherited or dethroned, or suspended, as the case may be. It is not with the merits of their cases that v e now wish to deal. Doubtless they will receive due attention; more, perhaps, when we have settled as to the mode of dealing with them than at present ; but at present we would confine ourselves to a disctzsion of that mode; and we confess that we look upon this as one of the very gravest questions that have come under our notice for many years. 3t is one which affects not only the purity of ou! Indian policy, the righteousness of our judicial administration there and of our courts here ; but something which, if it be not more momentous than these, comes more nearly home to our patriotism and self-respectviz., the character in India, of our senators in St. Stephen's; and that it is not considered animportant by the House itself may be inferred from the motion of which Mr. KnNismnn has given notice. Yes; this is the question which we can neither blink nor shirk. Is the Parliament of Englandor, to speak more correctly, one branch of it, the House of Commons-to exposD itself to a reproach which was spurned by many a senator of Rome? Is it to expose itself to the suspicion of being systematicaly and individually canvassed? Yet there seems to be too great a likelihood of this. But recently we had a private bill passed through Parliament for restoring a large income to an appellant Nawab, and we may socn expect the King of OuDX with a similar suit. Of the Nawab's claims we have already spoken, but of the manner in which such private bils are likely to be advocated hereafter what can be said ? What will be the course pursued, and pursued sucessfully, by the friends of future suitors ? Great legal firms will take up a cause. They will take it up as if it had been a case to be set dlown for the Liverpool Assizes or Vice-Chancellor WooD's court. They will take it up with the spirit, the energy, the zeal, that legal firms of repute pre-eminently exhibit when the fortunes of a rich client are at stake. Nor will their natural influence be wanting to the cause. C-reat firms are the clients of great advocates. These advocates will be naturally canvassed by their powerful clients, and, quite in accordance vwith the nature of things, this canvass will not be unsuccessfuL Eminent counsel will come down to the House and speak-, not at the bar, but from their seats, in favour of Indian Princes. The unfeed eloquence of the senator will sometimes transcend, not in its force, but in its fortune, the feed eloquence of the advocate. Nor will this be all. The interests at stake will be great. The exertions made will be adequate to the cccasion. Such exertions will be made as are seldom suggested and more unfrequently attempted, and which require the most consummate adroitness and tact. We particularly desire not to 'be misunderstood. We do not impute the possibility of corrupting any gentleman representing a constituency in St. Stephen7s; but extraordinary civilities wril be shown by the ex-potentate's supporters to the members or the relatives of members; rich Cashmere shawls will find their way to the delicate hands and fair shoulders of those " nearest and dearest" to the affections of the men who have to pronounce on his ultimate fate. Orientils have not only beautiful shawls to give, but also a most winning mode of giving them; and then, when once given, how can their husbands and brothers or friends refuse to attend in Parliament when the case comes on ? Now, we state our fears th-us in perfect good faith. We believe things hsve happened in. former days just as we have mentioned. But, though there will bo no corrupt; motive, we very much fear that in India such motives will be imputed notwithstanding. Tho Italian proverb might be transferred to the Indian-" Amente per "nienfe." In India nobody gives presents without an object, and all men are supposed to be corrupt.. Gifts will be given here; the recipients will do what they were wished to do. The logic of India will rectify the imperfections of the syllogism, and improve upon the practice of the Indian Prince. It is for the House of Commons to consider this well. It is also for that Honse ('in anticipation of the King of Ouima's case) to cbnsider whether there be not some danger to its credit in allowing its professional members to spez& under circumstances which to the hasty and illogical public of England, and to the more illogical millions of India, seem to imply the inspiration of a munificent " retainer." Such a suspicion, we know, is as unfounded as it is vulgar. Biut, unfortunately, its yulgarity is but another name :tor its popularity, and its popularity might soon become inexpressibly damaging to our representative syAtem. People are so accustomed to hear the ad4vocacy of such cases from retained advocates at; the bar thathowever foolishly and unreasonably-they will believe the great advocates qpqanllg within the bar to be retained also. And, if Englishnien believe this, Eindoos will believe it still m6re. It is an absurd and ridiculous suspicion enough, but it is for the House to consider whether it will expose to the taint of such a suspicion the men who are to dignify the highest posts, anid to display the brightest purity in the administhation of justice, who are now, as legislators in ono House, training themselves for the combined functions of judges and legislators in another.
The report of the Railway Department of the Board of Trade for the year 1855 is uow published. Ten years have elapsed since that fever of specula. tion, wbich may be compared witIL the South Sea madness or the joint-stock shentes of 1825. It may be as well, then, to give inl a few lines the position 'and prospects of railways at the present .time. One thing strikes us at the outset of the * investigation. We are reminded that the united kingdom is a small country, `auid that it early developed the new system-of communication whicl is the great 'work of this age. The railvays of England and Scotland are pearly; coimpleted. IReland alone remains-as a field for the constructionof great li'tuik lines. The history-of the invention in this country may.be divided into three parti. During 15 years after the first locomotive was successful in the north of England the nation seemed to have no due sense of the magnitude of the change. 'Habit,. prejudice, the supposed; interests of the landed proprietors, combined to keep up the old coach and posting establishments, wlhich were' fondly contrasted with 'tlie iron 'abominations by which the beautiful landscape of England 'was threatened. While the Amerivans were intersecting their continent* with lines, and English capitalists were lending money for the 'purpose, this country had in prospect only a few -'lhndred miles of railway, uniting the great centres of' manufacturing. industry with the metropolis. Accordingly, when the profitableniess and even the necessity of a thorough comnunication was proved, it 'was sought to do everything at once. The second phase of the history is the specuilation of 1845 ; the third is. the reaction in which we are even now involved. In the yeiar 1846 no less ';han 270 railway acts were pamsed, authorizing the construction of 4,538 miles of line. In the year 1855 only 73 acts and 363 i;iiles receivted the sanction of the Legislature. Yet the decrease has been by no means regular, and, if we take into consideration the great expense of the war and the development of hipming and other enterprise, it may be doubted whether railway construction does not again show a tendency to'increase. During three years after the commercial crisis of 1847 railway legislation almost ceased altogether. Eu 1849 only 16 miles, and in 1850 only 8 miles, 'were autthorized; in 1851 the number of miles rose to 135, and in 1853, the last year of peace, 940'miles received the assent of Parliament. In 1854 the mileage fell to 485, and last year to 363. All things considered, it may be said that -railway construction has somewhat- recovered from the depression which succeeded the mania, and 'may be expected to follow, on a safer system than heretofore, the legitimate wants of the country. A point not unworthy of notice is the greater ratio which Irish enterprises bear to the whole duiing the past year. The length of line authorized in 1855 was 196 miles in England and Wales, 76 in Scotland, and 91 in L-eland. The total length of line authorized by Parliament down to the end of 1855 was 14,346 miles. Of this vast length, 8,280 miles were actually open at that date, leaving 1,491 niles abandoned under subsequent acts, or by authority of the commissioners, and 4,571 miles which still have the authority of Parliament. With respect to more than half of this latter amount, the powers for the compulsory purchase of land and the completion of the works have expired, and the number of milea which it is probable will be made does not much exceed 2,000. It may -be said, therefore, that 10,000 miles represent the lengtn of present and future railvrays as contemplated up to the end of last year. This is indeed a great extent for so smaU a country, and beyond comparison with any foreign State. Yet there is no reasbn to believe that the limit has been attained. The recklessness of recent constructions, the history of branch lines which have been suckers and not feeders to the trunks, of extensions intended chiefly to benefit individual landowners, contractors, engineers, or lawyers, have caused railwaysschemes to be regarded with suspicion, and the public to be generally of opinioni that 'we have .quite enough for the present. But, with the con- tinued progress of the country, with a cheaper system of construction, and a mor(e conscientious legislation, there is no reason that railway communication should not continue to increase at the rate of a few hundred miles annually for an unlimited number of years. From construction and the details of mileage we may turn to the financial position and working arrangements of the companies. The system of working the line of one company by meansof another company owning a line in connexion vith it has been largely accepted. Both imder Parliamentary authority and by private arrangemeat such cases are becoming very numerous. Seven companies had entered into compacts of this kind at the end of 1855. Where Parliament is concerned we are told that the agreements are generally framed in such a manner as to render it the direct interest of the company working the line to develope the traffic. But there is another kind of agreement now brought into use, by which the interests of the public may not be sD well served. Companies are agreeing among themselves to divide in fixed proportions the receipts arising from the traffic between certain places. Thus a practical amalgamation is effected, and all the advantages to be derived from a fair competition are destroyed. It may be recollected that some time since certain companies were carrying passengers to the North at merely nominal fares. Au absurd strife has generated the opposite extreme of irresponsible monopoly. An agreement has been entered into by " the London and Ncith-Western, "the Lancashire and Carlisle, the Caledonian, the 3'Kidland, the Great Northern, the North-Eastern, and the North British Railway Companies, by w'which the receipts from all traflic between Lon"don and certain towns in England, and Edin- burgh, Glasgow, and other districts in Scotland "to the north of those towns, are paid into one "fund and divided in certain fixed proportions." Turning to finance, it is said that " the position "of railvay property is sound." Daring the six years sacceeding 1849 the proporticn which the gross receipts bear to the total amount of money raised has risen from 6.13 per cent. to 7.45, or about 1 1-3. But, unhappily, the working expenses rose Last year from 45 to 48 per cent. of the gross receipts, and*thus the average rate of dividend remains at little more than 3 per cenit. Indeed, railway shares were in July, 1855, lower than at any time since 1851, and nearly as low as at their deepest-depression in 1849. It is natural to seek a remedy for excessive fluctuation in the creation of a body of permanent sharelholders, 'who shall lock on railway shares as an investment for their money, and not as securities to be speculated with for the sake of profit from sudden changes of value. It has been often asked why discreditable transactions have been in so many cases acqutiesced in by shareholders, who nmust have .known that their property was being deteriorated. But, where a -large body are only anxious for the sudden rise in value of the commodity they possess,the phenomena of " cooked" accounts and payments of dividends out of capital are easily explained. It is evident that such a body of proprietors as will take a permanent interest in a railway can only be called into existence when railway management inspires the confidence pf those -who cannot always have an eye on the market. The supervision af the State in such great dundertaldngs will now ba contested by no one, and the great problem is .to provide. some system of audit which shall control the directors and those of the shareholders who have' less interest in permanent dividends than in a temporary rise in the price of shares. On the whole, it cannot be said that the present. state or the fiuture prospects of railway- are unsatisfactory., The country has, indeed, gained wonderfully by the. zapidity and conpleteua 91 the construction, however marred it may have ,been by follies, -mistakes, and delinquencies. We have gained a 'quaoter of a century in advance of the continental n4tions, and tnat in these days of commercial competition is no small thing. One or two facts may be cited as proofs of the wide-spread benefits. of the system. The average fare per mile for all clases of passengers does not exceed 1id. Thus the great service ren'dered by the railhayg to the poorer class of passen-; gers is demonstratec; and from other parts of the report we learn. that the use, of- the trains by third-class passengers for short distances as largely increased, showing- that the poorer ranka have learnt to avail themselves of this muode of transport in their ordinary business. The thirdclass passengers amount in the united- Idngdom to 54 _per cent., and in . Scotland to no less than 72 per cent., of the whole number conveyed. A singular revolution has marked the, last seven years. In 1849 the proportion of goods -traffic to the whole was 47 per cent., now it is 56, while in Scotland the average receipts from goods traffic are very nearly two-thirds of the whole. The railway-at farst intended only for passengers, and those the wealthy few-is now not only the chief highway of the' poor, but actually derives the greater part of its revenue from the transport of the maaterials of commerce.
All who are as conversant with humau nature as we are obliged to be are aware that there exists in many minds a positive appetite for being libeUed. kRife as calumny is said to be, there is a still deeper desire to be the -victim of it. Persons are found to speculate, not so much on the purse of anv alleged libeller as on the sympathy of the public. Such attempts would never be made -if there did not also exist a readiness in some other minds, scarcely more healthy, as it seems, to us, to lavish their interest without much inquiry. We are driven to some such reasons to accountfor an action, and the present result of that action, at Guilcdhall yesterday, and reported in our columns this morning. Our readers may remember, or more likely will have forgotten, that in the thick of our intelligence from the Crimea, when we were daily giving all Idnds of details of camp life, a letter from our correspondent contained a statement that the agent of a celebrated military tailor in London had come into collision with the Provost MIarshars people, and, in spite of remonstrances and references, had been flogged. We had not ourselves the smallest idea who the person vas, or who the military tailor was; and, although it was sworn on the trial yesterday that there was only one representative of a military tailor in Bala3dava, we had nio reason to believe there were not many. Even in this metropolis it is no unusual thing for gentlemen to get into scrapes and to be exposed to indignities.; and only in yesterday's paper we gave an account of such an occurrence, in which a Mr. Gr.AnAm was most grossly and brutallv ill-used by the Windsor polce. We were aware there was rather stern discipline for such people at the camp. It was, then, in perfect simplicity, without the least offence, and, indeed, in utter ignorance of the hero of the story, that we published the statement. lu due time, however, we received a lawyer's letter demanding an apology. Our apology would have been worth nothing, and, in fact, we should not have been justified in maldng it without some new information, which we could only obtain by sending to the Crimea. This we did at once, and the very day after we received. a contradiction of the statement we publ. lished it in a prominent form, and, we beg to submit, in a perfectly simple and inoffensive style. It will be found in the report of -the trial, and our Ireaders can judga for themselves whether, as r.x x. CAE&nns states, "it was a sneering and con" temptible paragraph, as offensive as it was "scandalous." I Notwithstanding the very hard words which M1r. Ml. CHaMms thinks fit to apply to us, and the effect they seem to have produced on the jury, we beg to submit that regard to trath itself, not to speak of self-respect, enjoined the duty of inquiry. We had published a statement that a representative of a militar~y tailor had got into a street row in Balaldava and had been flogged, ancd some months afterwards a solicitor sends us a letter on behalf of a " Mr. Su," an utter stranger, and calls upon us to state in a leading article that he was not the man ilogged. If there was a simple and honest desire to protect a servant of Messrs. BucsrmAsTna, bearing this not very-ncom- iUon name, from the ridicule of his acquaintance, I he and his friends should at least have helped us to a contradiction. It appears, however, that at the time they had a letter from the Provost Marshal, which MIr. Snr had procured at Constantinople and brought home -with. him, which we should have been ready to publish, and vnich would have answered every fair purpose. Mr. Justice WiLrEs at once saw the true nature of the case, and urged that it was surely enough for the defendant to withdraw the charge and pay the costs. The jury, however, yielding to Mr. Mv. CHAmBERs's eloquence, gave to MIr. Sar the sympathy he has been at sucn pains to procure, and for a statement, withoult any names, that a tailor's agent hacl been flogged they muleted this journal in 4001. It is unnecessary to say that such a verdict cannot stand, and we shall at least try -whether another jury can be found so ready to talke Mr. MI. CHAAmnns's views as to the duties of a public journalist and the proper style of an apology.

FOREIGN INTELLIGBNCE. FRANCE. (FBROM OUR Ow0( CORrZSPOxDF'T.1 rMe followig appeared in our WecoUd edition of yes- terday :-1 - PARIS, TIutRSDAY. JuLY Si 6 Par. . General Kalergi, who has been residing in Paris for the last few months, is preparing to return to Greece, and he will probably take his departure in eight-or ten d4ys. Previousto leaving, howeyer, he goea to Plombi4es to take leave of the Emperor, rwho has shown him the greatest kindness since his arrival here, and who has honoured him with imore than one audience. I doubt not that His 3lajeaty .ill have communicated to him -his opinion on the alii3rs of that ill-governed country, ao far as they bear upon the great Eastern qjuestion. I take Â«he present opportunity of atating my firm; conviction of the earnestness and sincerity with wvhich 'th Emperor adheres throughout toEngland in her views of Eastern policy, whatever appearances to the contrary may at any future period arise. Well .aware of the vexations and persecutions to which malignity, animated by fanaticism, may have recourse, and which the Camarilla in particular woiAld exercise auganst all who have supported the policy. of the Western Powers in their conflict with Russia, the French Government have already mstructed: their Minister at Athens to warn the Governmnent ,of King Otho against any such conduct towards General Kalergi, of course on the understanding -thatthe General refrains fromn affording themany just pretext for so doing. This inoffensive line of conduct the General is well disposedto follow. That he vill resist any temptation to the contrarv is probable from his conduct on a previous occasion, dien, as a Deputy, he might have stood up in his place in the Chamber and defended hiniseti against the charg,es implied in the Royal speech. Re refrained fromn doing so out of regard for the highesli person-, ages. It is probable thlat Mr. Wyse wrill also' 'receive similar instructions from Lordl CLarendon, -and that he will inform the Cabinet of Athens that any act of persecution will meet with the disap-' prob.in of' the English Government. In truth. it will be but an act of common justice and gratitude. The services rendered to the English troops at the Pineus, at a period of great suIfering, were. suclh as ought not to be lightly valued, nor soon forgotten. It is known that cholera struck down the 3French troops many days before it crept in among the E:ngelish. The interval was so long that the English thoughat they enjoyed an immunityfrpm the: pestilence. They wrere not spared, how.ever, and the visitation came on w;ith errible suddennessin one night. The alarm was great at Athens, and the King urged the necessity of establishing ac*rdan saLitaire, and thus cutting off the Pireus from the capitaL General Kalergi,who was then in the Government, refused to adopt such. a measure. He sent, or rather accompanied in person, a convoy composed of six largewaggons laden with beds, utensils, and every article necessary for the emergency. Hospital, I believe, there was none for the English, at least not anything deserving the name, and there was a general deficiency in other respects. The first care of' the Mlinister vwas to look o-at for a building capable of supplying the deficiency, and the one he selected was the large college or school of the Piemus. He called upon the Mayor to deliver up the place to the English; the Mayor declined, but General Ealergi, tolerating no delay where every moment was so precious, had the doors broken in and the school furniture removed, and at once established from 200 to 240f beds for the sick. During the whole time the malady; raged he was to be seen twice a-day at the Pirmus inspecting in person everything, and supplying withi the utmost promptitude every necessary for our men. The gratitude of the sufferers has, I believe, been more than once expressed to him; and Colonel Campbell, who was then in command, andJ the whole of the officers of the corps, would not hesitateto testify to the truthofthesefacts. I allude to them less for that object than as justifying any in-' structions the English Government may think proper to give our Minister at Athens of a kind similar to those of the French Minister,, and tending' to protect, of course on the same understanding, General Kalergi from the vindictiveness iof 'the Camarilla for the crime of having supported the policy of the allies in Greece. After all, it is not too much to expect. WVhen it wvas decided that the allies should evacuate the Ottoman empire, they cenianded that the Russian Government shouldI grant an amnesty to the Tartar population of the Crimea for any sympathy or aid they might have afforded us during the war. General Kalergi ought not to be placed hereafter in a position to regret that he, too, had not a natural claim to be included in that amnesty. General Kalergi ought to be protected from a malignant Camarilla although he is not a Tartar. Greece 'rill be evacuated by the allies, as I have already informed you, to remove aRl pretext for Austria not loosening her gripe on the -Danubian Principalities. Indeed, the allies could hardly employ firm and determined language on this point so long as the allied troops continued an occupation which wras required by the necessities of the 'war; and we went to Greece to prevent a diversion. in favour of Russia. - Nothing can be more adulatory than the language of King Otho to the Emperor Napoleon. These flatteries, hovwever, are appreciated as they deserve; even King Otho is not considered a useless instrument in the underhand work of weakening the Anglo-French alliance. M. Walewski has more than once spoken energetically on all these topics, both in writing and verbally, and the Court of Athens cannot be ignorant of the fact. The Constantinople journals of the 23d ult. state that the evacuation of the Crimea was then proceeding slowly, owing to the want of transports. The allied troops remaining there did not exceed 15,000 men. The English bad only seven battalions, and the Sardinians 350 men, under the orders of a caDtain, who were left to guard the 'd1,tiriel belonging to the- Piedmontese army' which had not yet been shipped for Genoa. It was believed that Marshal Pelissier would embark on the 4th or 5th inst. At that'date the French force will be reduced to three regiments, and the Marshal wiRl surrender, with a certain solemnity, to the Russians the points still occupied by the French troops. On the same day the English will give up Balaklmaa. The evacuation will thus be nearly completed about the 5th. The local authorities, who had established customs offices at Mackenzie, and subsequently at the bridge of Traktir, have now extended them to the plain of Balaldava, which foreigners and merchants are forbidden to enter under the severest penalties. Excursions to Simpheropol, hitherto permitted, had likewise been prohibited. No person. is allowed to visit the country who is n6t provided with a certificate of good morals and' orthodoxy, delivered at St. Petersburg. SNuch are the ntew orders of the GovernmenX and they are being executed with the punctuality of the Russian con.sig?, unless the traveller - hs at his disposal certain arguments irresistible to ; :Russian employes. . The allied forces at C6nstantil' nople amounted to between 20,000 and 25,000 men; so that about 40,%l0O men will have still to be shipped for the-west. There is every reason to suppose that Turkey' wll- be entirely evacuated in the course of August, and in consequence of a decision of' the. rench Government, received by the in! tendants of the army at Constantinople, the Liouidation Commission, 'vhich was to have regulated all the accounts in Turkey, will settle them in France' in. order that the evacuation of the Ottoman territory may take place as speedily as possible. Letters from , Galatz of the 16th announce- that the commission sent to fix the TAurko-Russian boundary line in Bessarabia had artived dat Akermann, whence it had followed the frontier indicated in the Treaty of Paris. On -reaching Bolgrad, however, the commissioners per- ceived that the l would have to undergo importent modifications. They nevertheless continued heir laboursi along the river Yalpuk. Kertch was completely evAcuated by the English on the 6th -alt. Thebill for reforning the French Customs Tariff hasbeenathrown over to thenextsession of theLegislative Body; ir the meanwhile the Dgbats, with a view of chechnig any unauthorized joy that this circunstance may create in the minds of the Protecti6mist irty in France, publishes a list' of petitioners oin favour of a reform of the restrictive tariE. This lt was dawn up three years ago, but it may be aZafely aurised that the advocates of free trade have 'rapidly increased in number and', inportan since that period. The list comprises the :names of the most eminent men of business in rance. It is said that the members of the Legislative Corps have been eammetly recommended to do their best towards allaying any alarm that may exist among the manufacturers in the departnents on that subject, and the Prefects have received instruc- tions to the'same effect.. The Protectionist Asociation, which has assumed formidable dimensions, leaves nothing undone tg excite the public mind against all liberal reforms of the tariff. A telegraphic despatch frxom Madrid of the 2d inBt. says 'The Civil Governor of VaUiadolid has been dismisdid. Castile-is tranquil. Th3 cause of the late disorders ix still ~involved in mystery." The Uniivers says "TheConissienof the FrenchAca,demy for compiling s new dictionary was formed inl86. It is eompyx;d of six members,who receive a yearly salry of 1,200f., or together 7,200!. It follows that in the course of 20 years tbd six mnembers must have drawn a su,m of 144,000f. At this day, not only has the commission not findshed the letter A of its dictionary, but it has not gone beyond the ad jective effedtionn. An approximate guess may therefore be given as to the period when the commission will have terminated its labours and also the expense it will entail on the State." M.

XPrince Gortschakoff left Vienna the evening before last. The day originally fixed by Prince Gortschakoff for his departure was the 20th of, JLune,buta shorttimebefore itarrivedhe madeknovin! his intention to remain until the 23d. On the 23d, when the Russian- statesman- announced his wish: to stay " until the beginning of July," the publici began to suspect that something of great importance' was occurring in Vienna, but the public, as is not un-; 'frequentlv the case, was mistaken. Prince Gort-' schakoff was merely waiting for the Grand Cross of, St. Stephen, or of -some other Austrian order, butl on the 28th he lost patience and went to Dresden and Berlin, where he probably has a little anti-, Austrian business to transact. The philo-Russiansi inthis city are almost unable to realize the fact that} a Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs has been, permitted to quit Vienna without having -re- - ceived from the Emperor any more strikirng proof of kindly feeling than an invitation to. dinner. .Notwithstanding the various-disasters which haveI occurred in France, the Vienna Exchange continuesp to display very great steadiness. In the opinion of I men learned in fnance-matters, the Credit Bank is; the " balancing-pole " which enables the Vienna Ex-, -change to preserve its equilibrium, and there is no' reason to doubt that such is the case. The A ustrian' Credit Bank is censur6d by many forits exaggerated ca.ation; but Baron Bruck and the founders of thee institution never intended to take the French Criditt Mobilaer for a modeL - It is true that the CreditBank is concerned in all the new railroad enter-i prises, but it does not fail to sell a great part of. the shares which it has taken in them as soon as a reasonable premium can be obtained. It is considered certain that the Credit Bank has alreadyrealized between 5,000,000fi. and 6,O00OOgO1l.i by the sale of Lombardo-Venetian Railroad shares,; and half that sum by its fortunate speculations in the NationalLoan and other Government stock. As thc. Credit Bank also does discount business, the National Bank is no longer so much inclined to reject good -bills as it was a few months ago, and the consequence is that money may now be had on reasonable terms. The issue of,tho shares of the Vienna-Salzburg Railroad has made no impression whatever. on the money-market, and a very considerable part of' them has already found their wav into what is -ecimically called " iirm" haZnds. The non-speculat-ing public also buys very largely in Theiss 'Railroad shares, as it justly reasons that stock for which Government gtiarantees 5 2-10 per cent. cannot be dear at 105. It will probably be seen, and at no distant period, that the Theiss Railroad will be one of the best of the Austrian industrial enterprises. Some of the' Austrian manufacturers had -pro-posed to petition the Minister of Finance to make a change in their favour in the Customs tariff, but they have reconsidered the matter, and intend-for the present to remain quiet. It having been remarked that the Bohemian glass manufacturers are equalled, if not surpassed, by their foreign rivals in I regard, to the form of their wares, the Commercial Department has sent some first-rate draughtsmen to Bohemia. This city has been surbjected. to great I and sudden cbanges of temperature within the last few days, but the state of the public health is not worse than usual. There has frequently been a difference of 35 and 38 degrees (Fahrenheit's scale) l within six hours. .It may be as well to call the attention of the -traI velling public to the rapidity with which the voyage | between Constantixiople and Tnieste is now made. A fellow-countryman, who returned from the Turlk ish capital by the last boat (the America), informs me that he left Constantinople on Friday, the 20th! and reached Trieste in lhe morning of Thursday, the 26th. 'The steamer reached Syra 12 hours.before her time, so that she was obliged to stop there 18 hours instead of six. My informant also assured me that the accommodation, food, and attendj ance were first-rate. The Lyonnais, a steamer belonging to a French company, managed t6 get up the Danube as far as GZiurgevo; but when there her captain was obliged to apply to the agent of the Danubian Steam Navigation Company for coals. The agent asked by electric telegraph for instructions how to act, but it is not yet known what reply was given. ITALY. . (FROX OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) NAPLES; Juon 26.' IC Sir William Temple had an interview-with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Monday," so said one informant, and " a separate note, and a very strong one, has been presented by the English Government to' that of the Two Sicilies," said another informant. I do not believe the report; the wish-was father to the thought, but I think it may adinit of discussion whether such a step might not and ought not in prudence to be made. As France and Austria ha-e chosen to regulate the, affairs of Northern and Central Italy, perhaps a dtie regard to her just influence would justify British interference in the south of Italy. So. much for this question as one of policy. Nor does it appear to me to be in any degree less urgent if viewed as a question of honour. We have long been connected by sympa- thues sild by something more -with the,Two Sicilies; in some of -the moet interesting crises of- their history, when common honesty and firmnes united would have secured a better fortune for the country, we have encouraged and then abandoned them-to what let the bistry. of the last eight years reply. Now again, by, diplomatic expreasions of not very reasured force, we have wrought up the, Italians to the very highest pitch of hope, and inspired them with i; readinews to precipitate themselves into anymaa project, secure as theyfeel of the asistance of England. Far, however, from giving any encouragement to the Progresista, party, that which has been done amounts to at most worse than nothing. A note has been presented by the .Weatern'Powers, one of them now kiieeing in the dust before the representative of, the Popes. Theo efficiency of suc]i a note may well therefore be. doubted' where the sincerity of one Powrer is neu- tralized by the dou'ble policy of the other. This,' of course, is well calculated upon by Ferdinand IL, who has Austria close behind him urging him on to' defiance, and promising him assistance in case of need. The natural consequence is such a note as I have already described to you. His Majesty -has defied the Western Powers,. and: rising in his saddle runs a tilt against the political: prisoners by way. of showing his utter disregardlof all advice.. h the position of England, however, altered? Are her obligations cancelled? Are our. high words of :no' farther force than to show how ready we are to promise and to urge -n, and then to abandon? The political trials are again postponed to July 4. On the 27th of that month one year will have elapsed since the prisoners we3re arested. Twelve 'mont'hs of punishment for men presumed by the law to be as yet innocent ! No one dreams, of course, of their. liberation; they; are 'brought out, not to be tried,, but to be condemned..

The Gazette contains the following;- ,"Another incendiary has been shot at Valladolid., The Council of Var has condemned several rioters to imprison-, ment. More Earious cases remained to be tried. The Aumn- ber of prisoners is 70. At Palencia the principal authors I of the inceidiary fires 'were to appear before the Conncil:dE $ War on'the 27th, and the Captain-General was on the poisit of repairing to that, towm, with the auditor of war and' a3 .company of the National Guardc of VaUladolid, who asked to accompany him..

The Council of Ministers had decided that all the governors of provinces now in Madrid on leave should return forthwit7i to their respective posts.

The following [letter from E shareholder of the Graiid Trnk Railway of Canada gives a cohcisetbut, perhaps, atoo unqualified history of the geneiai course of that indertakdng, and of the position in which the subscribers may conceive themselves to be placed if the measure of relief, as it is called, which has been enteItained in the Canadian Legislature should be sancidoned and accepted by the London Board of Directors. At the same time it is necessiay to mention that there is little expectation of this course being adopted. The London Board, it is lie lieved, have not yet had the new arrangement formialy proposed to them, but whenever it is brouht imder consideration the decision will doubtless be regulated with a strict view to the interests of ;their constituents, although they wrvould, of coursb, 3se glad to promote any unobjectionable suggestion-tiat might be calculated to operate beneficiallyfoi -the contractors. The mag,nituide of the line, whic-h was projected to extend a distance of 1,112 miles, anid lo involve an outlay of 9,500,0001., causes great iniprtance to be attached to every question in relationato it "Sir,-The letter from Mr. Napier, in yonr ciy Tarticle of to-day's paper, reminds me that I am one of that helpless class, a raagway shareholder. Underwvhat circumstancesss a prudent man, I became one the following is my jusfilication. In 1853 the lirospectas of the " Grand Trank' 3lailwav of Canada" 'was brought under my notice. Warned bythe past, I of corse looked chiefly asto who 'were the pe6ple ulnder whose authority it was to* be cradled *nd broughtup, and what their proposals. Behold the fclliwing as directors in London "Thomas Baring, Esq., M.P., G. C. Glyn, Esq., M.P., agents of the province and directors on -behalf if the Canada Government; Alderman W.

Hoadgon, Esq., and 12 directors in Canniana, sib of whom held theehief Goverment offiees, with lr William Chapman, of Leadenhall-street, as secretary. " The prospectus showed that the railway would bal,112 miles, in 'which 'was included a lease of the Atlantic and St.ILawrence Railway, of 14Smiles, at a rental of 60,0001. per annua, and the capital required 'was 9,500,000t., sterling,.in which was included the constractionof theVicto a- bridge over the St. L-awrence, under the superintendence' of Robert Stephenson. Esy., IL?., as engineer.- "Inthesaid capital of 9, 500,0001, was a fusion of two rail'ways, on which had been laid out.1,41G,000t., which was to he recloned as capital; and there wvasreserved for allotment in Canada 837,GQ )L.; tot-al, 2,253,G00L1 The remaining capital of 7,246,000t.vwascreated as followis:-One-half inshares, oneforth in debent-esofcompany, and one-fourth in hands ofthe Canada Government, as afirst mortgage on the rlway. Of this 7,216,0001., one-half wi* to be allottetd to the English public, aud the' other half was agreed to bh taken at par by- the contractors, Mlessrs. Peto, Braisey, Betts, and Jackson. in part-payment of their contracts. "Interest at 6 percent. was to be paid in Londonuntilthe entire worhas were completed- and a summary of probable rei'enue was detailed, showing anet profit of IIA per cent. on the share capital. " In this prospectus the attention of the English public is prominentlygdrawn by the promote's to the large amornt *of Canadian capital invested; also great stress wvas laid on the certainly very importantfact that the eminent English finn of Messrs. Peto,.Brassey, Betts, and Co. had undertaken six-sevenths of the whole of the new works; 'be directors thereby boeing enabled actu,zally to define the cosa of the railway by 'the contracts made, so that there could he no arprehensien 'of the capital being insuflicient; - ted, further, the public nre again sass-ed that the directors; ?ho their contracts, have secured the delivers of thewbioleof the railway fully equipped and complete in everv respect "It 'was also stated that the receipts from the 390 miles opened in 1853, from Montreal and Quebec to Portlaud, would at once realize sufficient to pay the rental of 60,0001. per annum; and als) pay ail the interest on the debentures and bonds. "- Well, Sir, on considering the above, knoving the progress that the growing colony of Canada 'was making- and knowing also that in the names of the London directors I had a combination of strict integrity, high honouor, _nd excellent judgment, f-thought I could not be far wrong in embarking my 7iodi-s-n of money in this inves-tment. " I confess I did not rely on the 11l per cent. paraded, but I thought I was safe for the 6 per cent., and also coasidered it was not a bad scheme for Canada, where theuiate of interest ranged at 10 per cent. "The whole of the English capital vas allotted, ail the shares came out at a premium. "For the next two years, 1854-, sundry reports -ind annual meetin=s tbok place, in all 'which the call35,ara reported as weil paid and the works Drosecuted by the oontractors 'with energy anud rigour, the}on. GeorgePembertora congratulating the shareholders on their financial position and the progress of their magnificelt railway. True it is that a modest intimation is given of a loss of 298,0001. by a waxt of judgment as to the Portland section; and, what was worse, the dsheholders 'were informed thaLt the 8S7,6001. of capital r eserved for urties in Canada was in-no pait taken by the ungrateful people. However, to rempdy this, the directors had obtained an additional issue from the Canda Goveinent of 900,0001. bonds, thus bj so -such reducing the share capital and creating in an Laver ratio a preference charge. To this-not expecting perfectior in a rilw&ay direction, but, no doubt, lying on aose1 degree of judgment in the London directors-the saireholders appear to hare silently submitted. " Thus matters stood at the beginning of this year, the shareholders not having a hint even of any financial embarrassaent of the coampany, when your colusmns diacilced the fist act of the drama bygiving a report of a meeting of a portion of the shareholders to take steps to remedy -the i nnances of the compay, and the Hon.

The brigantine, on the contrary, alleged that sha was in proper anchoragc kroand','and that she had a soitable light hoisted. The Court -below decided in- favour of the brigantine on both issues, and imputed the blame solely to the steamer,,against which the present appeal was instituted.

The value of the prop rty salved was 6,M701. Proceedings to obtain salvage rkmuneration were instituted in the Admiralty Court of the -Cinque Forts, the learned judge of which- awarded a gross sum of 1,280L, whichhe thus distributed.-to the Liberty (a Colchester boatwhich had s-ved the lives of the crew) 4601.; :to the other Colchesterboats, 320,; to thiWhitsLable boats, 3201.; ho the Margate boats, 1001.; to the Mary (also a 3argate boat), 3W; and to the Milton boats, 501 Against Atih deoree the present appeal asa prose.nted by the Whit-.. *sable and Margnatsboats, on wiose beha'f it wascontended, 4frst, that the gross sum was an inadequate reward, and. secondly, that they had not received P. due proportion-of the amnount allotted. 'Dr. ADDArs and Dr. BAYFORD were heard for the appelLints; Dr. RoBnesox and Dr. Twass for the respondents. I Lord-Sustice KIG'ST BRituc; in delivering the judgment of their Lordships, said that, considering the distress and danger in which tho vessel was placed, and.the merritorions nature, so far as some of the asrvors wereconcerned, of the services rendered, their Lordships would, in all probabihtyj }had the case come originally before them, have been dispesed to allow. a reater amount of total remun-' I eeration. It was, however, a 'settled rule, and one of great utility, particularly with reference to cases of this |description, that the differenee ought to be very considerable to induee a Court of Appeal to interfere upon a question of 3neze discretion. Ongeneral grounds, their Lordships *ould Aot inerease the amount given in the court below. The - largate smacks, t which 1001. had been allowed, appeared, so far as their Lordsbips could form a judgment, to have inisconducted themselves greatly and to have done more larm than good; and bad they not been joined in the appeal ,vith the other cppellants to whom no such observation applied, theirLordabius wouldhave beendisDosed to take away one-half of that sum. Their Lordships, however, *ould decline to interfere in that case also. With regakd to 40t.1 c9mposed of two sums of 3201 each, one of these iurms sfiold be allotted exclusively to nine'boats, which arrived on the 15th of November -namely, seven boats from 'Whitstable, the Prince of Orange and the Unity.

ZAW REPORT. ROLT0' COURT, CaAcmy-rua, JuLY 4. [BAL'DVl]T V. BALD'Wll. Betort the - al ASTER of thet HRorn.T nims case came before the Court as to the construction of t.he will and codicil of the late W illiim Baldwin, of Sedgley. in the county of Stafford, dated the 25th of May, 1854. The testator by his will gave the sum of 4,000 . to trustees, to provida stipends and annruties for any. number (not exceeding ninie) of poor elderly perns of both sexes, who, through misfortune, should he in indigent circumstances, or inanyother respects he worthyobjects of charity." The testator further empowered his trnstees to settle by deed the nses to which the sSid sum of 4,000l. should be appied, so as best to support "the institution" to which he (the testator) intended it to be applied. Nineteen days after this will was made, the teststor made a codicil to~ it, by which he conrimed it, " save and except such part or parts thereof as related to the building of almahouses, which said part he revoked, and desired that his executors should be released from carrying out the same, and the stipends and annuities connected therewith." The question left to the Court was, whether the rambling rwords of the codicil revscked the specific gift of 4,OOg. in the wil l and His HoNOxJs held that the codicil did revoke the wiU in tbis respect, inasmuch as the iatention of the testator was evidently to revoke somethirng, and there was no other gift in the will to which the words of the codcil would apply except the charitable gift of 4iODOI., to he applied in providing " stipends and annuities for poor persons." Mr. iz Palmer, Mr. Wickens, Mr. Drnce, and Mr. Bird appeared in the case.

COURT2 OF. QOJEE'S BENCH. GUnITAT .TTTmv. 4- lOVILL V. FY'O BRT" An ANAmVn (Sitting at Nizi Prius, before Zer8 OmIPrBrM and a Sp- cida JTurp.) M3r. iKnowles, Q.C., r. Bovill, Q.C., Mr. Webster, and Mr. George Denman appeared for the plaintiff; and the Attorney-General, Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Hindmarch for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action, George Hinton Bovill, was an engfneer in Abchurch-lanes in the city; end he sued the le endants, Messrs. Keyworthi and Co., inlers at Lincoln, to recover damages for the infringement of a patent grnted to the plaintif, mJune 1849, for certain improvements in the manufacture of wheat and other, grin anto meal and flour. The principal defence was, that the painptiff's e tion was not n4w, it being nothing more than an addito to Gordon's patent, of 1844, of an exhausting apparatos which had heen in use in connexion with Gordton's patent before the year 1849, when the plaintiff's patent was taken out. It appeared by the evidence that, in the old method of grinding corn, a onsiderable amount of heat was generated by the friclion of the two millstones upon each other under a heavy pressure. The flour became heated and deteriorated, and it was also necessary to delay for some time the process of dressing." The object, then, was topreserve the quality of the flour, and also to expedite the " dressing' process. This w as effected by a p.atent taken out hy t e- plaintiff in 1846. whereby a blast or current of cold air was made to pass between the stones. This blew out the flour, and s cooled it at the same time. The apparatus, however, had a great defect, foritgreatly increased the qmuAtity of the "stive," or light floating particles of flour. This increased to such a degree that the health of the workmen suffered, and the invention was to a great exÂ¢tent deprived of its utility, thohI i stil used. But in the year 1849 the plintffto out h'i present patenLt, which consisted of an exhausting apparatus, adapted to the blast apparatus of the patent of. 1846. By this exhausting apparatus the "e tive" or floating dust was collected in a chamhber and there sifted. The current of air pa ig between the millstones brought the ",stive" along with it into the chambet. The air was then. drawn through the walls of the chamber, consisting of a -ine woollen substance, 'andL left the "astiveo" behind it in the chamber, where it- settled and was collected. The improvement thus introduced was at once appreciated, and aidopted in several large establishments; and, accrdig to the evidence, it was equal to an addition of Is. to the value of every barrel of flour. Th6 defendants, who were large millers at Idncoln. adopted the plaintiff's patent, and for several years they paid him 1,7001. a-year for his licence to use it. But they had given not-ice to discontinue it, aua bad since used an iapparatus-made by a M1r. Gordon, which the p laintiffnow contended was an infringement ofhIis patent of 1849. It appeared that in the year 1844 two year bfore the plaintiff's. first patent, Gordon had taken out a patent for intro?'icing'a blast of c-old air between the maillstones;- and, accord.ing to the defendants' contention, they had do'ne no 3more than uae Gordon's patent, with the addition of an exhausting apparatus, which they contended was not thesuibject et2a patent at all, it havig been in common use at the endof he ear184, oretha a earbefrethe plaintif a ajicifcaton as nroled Th deendntscalled a Mr. Muir,ofthTradstonmuls Glagow,andh stated -that, mil atAltna,inDenark an tht e immediatel intrducedit ino theTradeatv-mills in. - i3e-y n conjunction vwith Gordon's apparatu B whais (la Novinil: 1848 the sappuarmN 'whicl -wzxUiptnbJplo'tbe altneas the plaintiff'g, Identical at edi bi ordon fcr nfo t ane ndf n h -t ~wia i. fUll operationwat the Tr,Aeston.mills, According to tIe witness's stateineut,it wain common use tbere long before the plain-tiffespatent,-thoughit.was afterwards discontinued.

JMIBs said, this action was broUght to recover b. 5001. which had been intrusted to 'he defendant for a speCifie prpose, which purpose he had failed to perform. TMhe plaintiff was a gentleman of private fortune. On the 12th of Febraary there vws a vacancy in the representation of the borough of Leominster. Ho was then residing at Hendon, near London, and was a fiiend of Mr. Trelawny, who, suggestedtotheplaintiffthat he should go down to Leominster and contest the borough, and the plaintiff was introduced to the defendant, an attnrney and Parliamentary sgent; The-plaintiff was then quite a novice in election mnatters,an&he placed himself in the hands of the defendant, They wentdown together to Leominster, and. they h2d a discussion about the amount of the expenseof such an election' 'and the defendan t said the epenses would be 5001., andthie plaintiff then gave the defendant a cheek for thatairiount.

This check 'was given Somee time afterwards the defendant again called on the plaintiff, and then wianted him to give him a check for another 5001., as he musl, pay that sum through thie eleti6n'iuditcr. -TYhe- plaintiff refused to give another check unless thi former oneI was given up; and, as the defendant had not paid the election expenses, a demand was made for the other check or for the money, but it had not yet been paid, andit became necessary to bring the present action.-- James- CampbelL-4On the llth46f February I had an interview with AMr. Trelawny, reldive to my becoming a candidate - for- Leominster. He ixtroduced fr. Dennes to. me, ant on the 12th we went to Leominster. It was arranged to retain two other ageats. The defendant hadasked me how much expense I was willing to incur. I 'siidlS1.; but he said itmust be 500L. to covertheexpinses. I hesitated, but decided to go on, and gave him a check for 5001. Not n word was said about it being given for procuring votes. The pollinw took 'place on'the 19th, and I was unsuccessful, -and we .eft'Leominster the same Ievening. I afterwards saw the deifendant at the Reform jClub, and we wrote an address to the electors. I several times requested defendant to get the accounts settled. He always said he must go down, but could not then. On the 12th of May he brought some accounats, and told me to sign them, as admitting them to be due. They amounted to. 4211 I then agreed to givo thirm-ie guineas -retzainer, 100 guineas fee, and I gave him a check for 311. more. He afterwards came to me and! said he had passed the accounts, and he found the money must not be paid by him, but by me; therefore,hesaid, " You must give nie anothercheckfor 500. for election expenses." I said it- was inconvenient, and I asked him to pay me back the 5001. Ihaadgiven him. He said he world give me an I0 U.. I consalted Mr. Knox, who was in! my house at the time. I declined to giie a fresh check: He said I must give him a gualrantee, as it w. ould look very had if he gave me back the check. I p reposed to go to his; bank and get back my money. flu said he had some other appointment. I wished him torTi de on with me, but he declined to do so at first; but aftenvards got into the cariage, hut got outattho Regent's CanaL In .answer to Mr. Knox he said he did not refuse tol - give it ba-ck, but made many excuses and thengot out of the carriage. Cross-exaained.-We talked overthe amount for the exenses in the street at Leominster, when the defendant said, 1. would not cover the expenses. At last we fixed upon o001. He did not say it was to be given him to procure my return, nor was there any such undlerstanding. This paper is in my handwriting, and I gave it him at the time. There was no understanding about his procuring myreturn,or abouthis endeavouring to procurel mylreturn. Idid not use the word endeavour. The morey was not givenupon that understanding, either on my -part or his. He was to pay the expenses. The money wviLs not given to him to endeavour to procure my return. We was to serve me as agent. He was to pay the local agents. I did not pay my personal expenses at Leominster. I bought a railway rug thereon going away. The defendanii did not offer to give me his check for the amount; he refused to do so, or to exchange checks. Re-iexanined.-The 501. was given him to pay the expenses. After casting up the accolnts, he said, " The only thing that remains is my fee, and if I have the same as given to the other agents I shall he satisfied." Mr. A A. Knox-I am a memberofthe bar. The plaintiff is a friend of mine. I was present on the 21st of May, whein the plaintiff and the defendant were together. We were a in the carriage. The conversation -commenced about a guarantee which the defendant wanted to have, but which the plaintiff refused to give till he had the money. I said, "'Are we to understand you refuse to give back the money? He said, "No, no! I will pay the people at Leominster mvself." 2Mr. V.W. Holmes.-Iamthe election auditor. Onthel3th of February I received this papsrfrom the defendant, which is his appointment as agent to the plaintiff. The defendant also gave me an account of some charges which he bad paid himself. and he also gave me a Taper containing his own personal charges. On the 15th of lfay I received from the defendant's clerk the accouhts of the election expensesthey amounted to 5101 My charges were - added, which made 5321. I allowed those accounts. The amount was not remitted to me. I allowed the defendant's expenses of M3. KEtsu, for the defendant, addressed thejury, stating tnat when they came to look into the facts they would not think they bore the colour his friend had given them. There -had been a doubt whether the pasyment might not be an illegal matter, and the defendant tlerefore said he would go to L;eominster about it. If the def endant had intended to retainthe money he would not have gone to the plaintif's house, but he had gone to himn ana had gone in the carriaOo with two gentlemen, one of whom from his profession must be considered to be very acute,- and the defendant then told them he would go and settle the matter himself. Sharp practie had been resorted to against the defendant, and he bad therefore not resisted the tereptation to put certain pleas on the record, which might be considered a sort of return of the sharp practice. The accounts hsa been audited *on the 18th, and the writ was issued on the 22d. There hadbeennodemandafter theaccountshad been audited. But he would read a- letter which the plaintiff had written to the defendant before the election, w1hich he submitted would show that the 5o01. had been given to the defendant to pro- iure the election of the plaintiff. and therefore it came within the act of Parliament which ivas passed for the pro- -ventionofbriberyatelections. This wis the letter:-"I hereby authorize you to conduct the Leominster election for me on the understanding that all epenses incurred do not exceed 5001., for which I beg to enclose you my check.?' The defence to this action was, first, that a reasonable time had not elapsed after the accounts liad beert audited for the payment of the money before tho action was brought; -secondly, that the money was paid in order to induce the defendant to procure, or endeavour to procure, the election of tho plaintiff; and thirdly, that the money was paid in -respect of the election, and not through the election auditor aidon one of these grounds he submdtted he was entitled to their verdict. Mr. JAMES having replied, Mr. Justice WIGonrAN, in sunlosing up, said, the question was, whether he zefused to pay the money, because, I-unless he refused to pay, the action vouldnotlie. Ano'her C question would be, whether they balieved the money was '-given as auieredepository-thatitwas a sumhe wasto hold I as the mere agent for the plaintiff. - i The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.

(Sittings at Nisi Prius, before Mar. Baron A[ATr and Common Turies.) JF-\NMGGS V. nADDEVEY. This was an action to recover 1,1681. for money lent, money due on an account stated, and for interest. The dei fendant'pleaded never indebted, and that the moneyclaimed by.the plaintiff was paid in respect,of a partnership concern i carried on between the plaintiff and the defendant. !Mr. Serijeant Shee and Mr. Thrupp were counsel for the lplaintiff.; Mr. O'Mlalley and Mr. 1,nsh represented the defendant. * The plaintifE; Mr. Richard Jennings, is a proctor at fDoctors-coammons, and the defendant, Mr. 19ontYord Baddeley, is a member of the bar, but not atpresent in practice It appeared that the defendant conducted a ooal and ironstone mine in Staffordshire, called he tIvy-house Coliery; but,-in 1852, having got into considerable pecuniarydiff sulties, he compoundedL with and obtained a letter of license from his creditors. Being in this position,and not being I able to carry on the mine, he proposed to the plainifl with whom he was aeusainted, to join him in the scheme, conceiving that it would prove a remunerative speculation on the introduction of a sufficient amount of capitaL inally articles of partnership v-ere drawn up between the partie by. wihich the plhinnifas to introduce 3,000D. into the concern, in consideration and as against the interest, plant, and machinery ;vhich tbe defendant had, in and upon the premnises. Whe 6th article of the deed -of partnierahip provided that the books of accounts should be under the control of the plaintiff, and the eighth article set forth that if either party should bring further capita into- the' undertaldng interest at the rate of S per cent should be allowed. Things went on, but as early as November, 1853, the mine was consideraboly in debt, al3 the capital w/hich had been brought in by tbe plaintiff as gone, and on the 1Gth of the same month one of the defendant's composition instalments, amounting t4 583!., fell ~dne to his creditors, and he, accOrding to the plaintiff's case, applied to the plaintiff for the amount, who; through kindness, made the advance to the defendautpersnally, and not on account of the partnership. Matters progressed, the mine continuingto be worked at a great loss, sonsuct so that the plaintiff in 1854wass25,)00l. out of pocket. On the lGth of 3iay in that year anothermnstalment amounting to 5S5t. became due from the defendant to his creditors, and he wagging applied to the plaintiff for assistance; but, being tuable to produce the money, he became security for the -amount, -which he was finally obliged to pay. The plaintiff's contention was, that these two sums, ZSX and 581-. res ectively, were advanced to the defendant for his person convenience, and not on account of the partnership transaction, or for the proposed extension of the works, which extension was never camried into effect. The substantial defence set up was that the sums claimed by the plaintiff were advancedto the defendant is.considea-a tion of the defendant consenting to extend the works of the |colliery, and that the plaintiff was to look exclusively to the colliery returns for repayment. The advance was made solely on this understanding. In the course of the proceedings, vhich occupied a considerable time, a voluminous correspondence was read, and a debit and credit account -betwseen the perties was produced, by which it appeared that ,the amounts claimed were entered in the partnership. .account. This, it was contended, provedthatthemoney was advanced on the understandin- that :t was to be debited against the mine, and-not against ihe defendant personally The learned JuDGE, having carefuly summed up the evidence, told the jury that the onus of proof was on the plaintiff, and that he would not be entitled torecover unless he bad satisfied them that the money claimed wat lent to the defendant for his own private purposes, and not on account of the partnership. - The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-for 1,1U ., tlhei amount-claimed.
COUTT OF BAiYKRUPTCY, anghs, JTuy 4 IN RE LYO-N SA!UFEL. (Before 21Jr. Comm Ak9merT EOLROYD. This was an application under the following circumstances:-The bankrupt, having bees in custody from August, 1855, becwme bankrupt in October, 1855. and applied. to Mr. Comn;issioner Evans for his dischlarge. That learned commissioner refused to make an order, except upon the' bankrupt giving satisfactory bail to the amOunt of 1,9O.; and which was subsequently reduced to 01. The bail not being given, the banlrupt has beenL several times before Mr.j Coimmissioner Evans and Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, with aview-to pass his examination or obtain his release. Ilis answers being unsatisfactory, orders of commitment have. been made, but which have not bcen enforced, the bankrupt being already in custody on tbe previoausprocess. Mr. SrunEGO, for the bankrupt, now app-ied for an order in his favour. Unable to get befl, and being also sub' jected to an order of commitment, not enforced, the bankrupt might be said to be virtually subjected to perpetual imprisonment. This arose from the peculiar jurisdiction of this Court. Learned judges had decided,-in a case reported in Vhc Times of yesterday, that a bankrupt miight be exanined in this court, and compelled to speak the truth and sign the examination papers. This being done, the lbukrupt was further subjected to an indictmelit for felony, aiid the evidence so obtained could be received against him on his trial. Mr. NFOPRTONe, for the assignees, said, the order of commitment had been made in consequence of the mianner i which the bankrupt had answered qaesiione relative to the alleged rsale of property of the value of 3,000., to one Petef Diamond.

Sir It, W. CARD]n said ho did not want to oppress him, but the practice was so demoializing inits nature that the niagistrates, both inth citst and atthe West-end, -were determined to put it down.

BEGGI&G LETTERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES. Sir,-I perceive that a practice to which I drew public attention some years ago, through the medium of your columns, and which I believed to have been discontinued, is being again revived. I allude to the practice of begginletters, enclosing a forged certificate purporting to be signed by a justice of the pence in some Irish seaport town. The *story told is generally pretty much the same-viz., that petiticner, a native of England, on her way to join her husband, belonging to some regiment quartered in the West Indies, has been wrecked on the coast of Ireland. A gentleman banded me one of these letters a few days ago, with -my name forged to it as a magistrate. Having forwarded theletter to Ireland, I succeeded in having the petitioner arrested just as she was handed a letter from the Earl of Aberdeen, containing a Post-offlce order for 21., in reply to one of these forged documents. I shall feel oblged by your inserting this letter, as I zaw desirous of putting charitably disposed persons on their guard against this mode of imposture. On calling some years ago at the Mendicity Society's office, Red Lion-square, I was shown a large pile of these forged documents. It maybe ell to observe that no such certificates are ever given by the Irish magisrates. Your obedient servant. JOHN WYNNE. l , Eccleston-terrace, South, duly 3.
