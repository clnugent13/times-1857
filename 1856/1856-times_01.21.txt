THE WAR IN ASLL - ;- - rRM A,OREro D,pA - - BEZERO, -DzcJ4* I told you- in my last of the dispute betweeti our ambassador nin-Persia and the Shah. 31r. Murray gave the litter up to the 5th inst. fo make up his imindaa to theliberation of thet 'terrinu causca bUioirnativeagent'srife, and as he stillcontinuedobstit nate, has leftTeheran. Themeshis rather a tanglod one, but, as the ease stands at present, Mir. Murray is undoubtedly in the right. The quarrel, by the latest accounts, was by no means irreconcileable; but KRars has fallen in -the meantime, and the Ruis sianu will certainly avail themselves of ths influence it gives then to widen the breach as much as possible. We are very quiet here in Erzerouim The soOw has come down honestly at last, a good hearty fall, covering everything but the minarets and chimneytops, so that our flat-roofed houses all look:like wedding-cakes. The Turks and Armenians are principally employed in shovelling it down with large wooden spades upon the heads of the passengers. It comes down 501b. ata time, so that betweenthat and the glass-smooth pathway wa'Iking, has become doubly perilous. Ontheotherhand,thatmysteriouspersonage -the Clerk of the Weather-haa taken the sanitary arrangements of the city into his own hands--not that the Turks arein the least obliged to him for this interference with their beloved " Kisxiiet:' The filthy gutters, that were an eyesore and sickenmg in former days, are quite choked up with high piles of clean -hite snow, which at the same time form very pretty mausoleunis for ths interment of innumerable dead donkeys-for the English notion; that no one can by any possibility see a donkey dead, goes for nothing fit these parts. They are dropped by the caravans, and used to lie festerig openly in the streets at every 50 yards. Now they are all decently buried, though not at all to the Satisfaction of our -only -free burghers, the pariah dogs, who look ragged-and sullen upon the change-very different from' the sprightly, well-conditioned- animals one used to watch some time baclk, chasing one another in the siushine, the very embodiment of phyfical hippiness. Now-a-days they hang gloomily about their separate municipalities, lean and hungry Cass i whose very look speaks treason. By and by, as the winter deepens, they will become fairly revolutionized, and-so the peopls here tell me-turn round and eat one another. Already they have not even the spiritforabark-leftinthem,notevenatnight;whereas in the hot weather one might have supposed that the whole hellish pack of Boccacio's tale were giving tongue, chasing some hard-hearted fair one through all the bazaars, streets, and byways of Ereroum, so general and incessant was the' noise they made. They used to have a Cerberus allowance of bark in those days, and every one of them could make noise enough for three. Now, I am writing at 2 in the morning, and I do nothear a singl bay. All thisthe quiet of the city-its comparative cleanliness, and the expectation of a healthy season, inake the prospect of our long winter more bearable; though at best it is a dull life to look forward to, as we are to be snowlocked in Erzeroum for the next fiva months at least. Stragglers are still coming in from Kars. t- met some yesterday, tolling over the snow-cld plain that lies between this and the Euphrates. -They showeed weary and footsore, poor fellows, but had not the wild,hungry look of thosewhohad preceded them. They had, probably, been recruitihg at the villages onthe road. But report states that no SleS than 1,500 outof the 6,O00Rediffs who were turned out6of Kars haveperishedinthe snows of the Siwaulidagli Our troops have, at last, been marched in from the Devr-buyunic (A7iglic, Camel-back) heights, where they had been encamped since thebeginning of last summer. It was high time that they shouldl ta3ke up their winter quarters. When last I visited the camp, some weeks since, the road was as trying as rain and thaw could makle it. The camels, withL their slow delberate gait, got over it easily enough, like wooden machines wound up for the purpose, but horsenanihip was hazardous, and the arabas, axledeep in mud, groaned along as if their very hearts- would break. Th ground of encampment itself was one mass of mud. The men, however, were not badly tented, better, indeed; than I had ever seen elsewhere. A wall of about a foot high and the circumference of a common tent being built in the firs$ instance, with a low conical chimney attached, the tent was pulled over the former, and pegged down tight at. the base. The inmates were thus at once sheltered from the night winds-which somehow have a great lnack of creeping in umder the canvas, and playing in and out of one's ears, as -though there were half-a-dozen of them at hide-and-seek-and enabled to keep themselves w by lghting afire. Fuel wasnotscarce, though it hadto be brought some distance from tha neighbourig mountains. The officers of higher rank improved uponthe above planof making themselves comfortable by scooping the earth out towrards the door in the form of a half-basin, then cutting it; down sharp and straight across the centre of the tent, about a foot and a-half, so that -the untouched remainder formed a sort of dais, orrather divan.- On this their mats and carpets were spread, and- they really looked very comfortable as they iat there cross-legged, smoking their chibouqaes. The horses were worse cared for; they stood ihivering inm the rain, for it was blowing a sharp'gale,-whicI. Icame literaUllyissing throughithe narrow valleys that surrounded the encampment. To add tothe -picture of misery which a camp always presents in wet weather, a tent woud every now and then be blown down, and its denlizens come scambling from between the tent ropes-some to tug at the violently flapping and almost unmanageable canqvas, others to purse their various garments, which by this' timet were shimnming along like seagulls before the wind. At that time, however, all this discomfort was to a certain degree necessary, but the inen andi horses were detained there a good deal longer than there was any occasion for, and it was not till the ranks had been greatly thinned by death,- disease; and desertion, and many valuable animals had perished througvh cold, that the Muchir here, Selirm Pasha, thought fit to order in the remainder. It would be difficult, indeed, to imagine a mart more ufit for a command than this sames Muchir; indolent, obstinate, stupid, seqsual to the full limits of Turkish sensuality; and, to crown all, a coward. There is only one thing to be said in his favour-he is not much worse than his brother Pashas, but, on the- contrary, a very fair specimen of his class.- Fortunately there are a few British officers here, and. their presence and interference are doubtless valuable so far as they can keep the Pashase in check. But there are many more wanted-there can hardly be too many-and a General is wanted to supporxt them. ; The whole system of administration. here i3 corrnpt beyond measure. It has a routine, too, which rides it lke anightmrme, and, forcing one's way through its red-tapeism is like swimming through seaweed. Take one example out of a thoumd. A young T4agyar officer here in the Tarkish service had 20 months' pay due. He applied for itto the MubiBr, the Muchir referred him to the president of theMedjlis, or council; the president of the council passed him on to the commandnt of artillery; the commandant; of artilery to thesub-commandant; thasubScomi mandant to the chief of the staff; the dit6f tlss staffEagain tothe president who at hastrecommnended. him -to lay a memorial i,eforo the Medilps, wicht being- done, -he, the -chief Ixiaum, 'ahil paie an~d1kno~w inot how, many ~other :wisacres, puet 'their h&- 3tove~therover-tho intrica- -clsii and- at Usst came to the- cinclusion that ,-itWomI. ccnFmiigthemselves; they might iDow -thG iiwrialist fix out of his 20, or Tather 2 2-s¶zoutha ay, for two months more had p1soed i g ow to get his.mmey.

She shareholders of the Doundee and Arbroath Rail,way have authorized the directors to abandon the preliminary agreement for leasing the line. The nine vacancies in the direction, caused by the resig.. mations at the previous meeting, have been filled np. Another lengthened discussion has taken placo ;rimong the proprietors of the South-Western 'ComIpany on the proposed extension to Exeter, and a anaJority have decided on adopting the report and confirming the agreement with the Salisbury and Yeovil line. The directors of the London and Brighton Company recommend the paymeut -of a dividend for the half-year ending the 30st of December of 21. 18s. per cent. on the .consolidated stock, making. the total dividend for -the year 1855 five per cent. The South Wales MIineral line has been leased to the Glyncorw Coal 'Company on a guarantee of 51 per cent. per tnnum. The works are to be inmmediatuly com=nenced. At the North British meeting the question -of demarding the resignation of the directors was Itrought under consideration. Although the motion 'was negatived by the shareholders present, it was -Admitted to be carried including proxies. The board, however, refuse to vacate their seats until dhey shaUllhave passed their money-bill in the enumng- session of P.arliament, and adjusted the capital -iccount. According to the report of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Company, the dividend -to be recommended is 5s. per 1001. on the ordinary 3tock, or at the rate of half per cent. per annumn. onsidering the late partial depression in trade and the state of the money-mnarket, the undertaking isregarded as being in a satisfactory condition. The ;town-council of Cambridge have passed resolutions calling attention to the tarifof fares and the general -tate of the Eastern Counties Railway. At the 3Midland Great Western (Ireland) meeting, the bil -authorizing an extension line to Strokestown, -the abandonment of a portion of the line to Long-ford, and for powrer to subescribe towards a proposed oute frora Strokestowvn to Castlebar 'was, after some .objections, agreed to.

RAILWAY AccrnsKr.-An accident likely to bo attended with fatal consequences happened on the Bristol 2ndEreter line between Taunton and the village of Creech St. Michael, on Thursday last. It seems that a farmer rnamed Coombes possesses land on both sides of the riil, and had occasion to send his boy with a horse and cart to cross the line. The boy, imagining that the 8&22 train (which was due about that time) had passed, opened the gate which divided the rail from the meadows, and took the horse and cart through. Having brought the animal to a standstill on the rail, the boy went back for the purpose of relockiag the gate, and while in the act of doing so the train caine up at a tremendous speed, and dashing against the horse tore and lacerated it in a frightful manner. The engine vwas immediately stop2ed inits progress and -it was found that the poor animal was literaly cut to pieces, and a portion of its flesh and harness caried away by the train. The engine was also d emapd from the 'nolenc6 of- the shock.

RAiLFWAY IXhTELLIGENCE. SWANSEA VATw The half-yearly meetin, of this company was held at Swansca on Monday; Mr. S. Benson in the chair. The Secretary read- the report, which stated that the trade during theyast six months was limited to the collieries near the port-1 2,318 tonswere conveyed; producing 2,7851' The additional works of the company were proceeding satisfactorly, andthe rails and timberfor the permanent way 'were ready for laying down to form the mined gauge required by the agreement with the South Wales Company. upon tho opening of the junction with the South Wales Raiway a large amount of new traffic was expected. The necessary measures have been-taken for obtaining the sanition of Parlament to an extension of the line to Ystradgunlais, which extension is much required for the trade of the district. It will be fire miles in length, and can be constructed cheaply and speedily. The wholo of the new shates have been issued, and the directors will endeavour to complete and open the remaining portions of the line as soon as circumstances will pernlt, so as to secure the increased revenu6 which must result from the large trade waiting to come upon the line. Resolutions were passed adopting the report, electing Mr. Grenfell a director of the company, approving of the extension of the line to Ystradgunlais, and requesting thedirectors to proceed as speedily as possible with the laying down of the mnred gauge from the South Wales Railway to the terminus. The meeting then separated. LEOMN3E STER AND R2GTON. The half-yearly aecou'nts of this company-to the 31st of' December last show that the receipts amounted to 52,037h, and the payments to 49,2681.,' leaving a balance in hand of 2,788. The line, a single one, wil be opened in- July next, and he works are being actively earnied on by the contractors, Eessrs. Brassey and Field, who have entered into a working agreement with the company for SiX years from July next,' under which they are to work the line, pay thel working expenses, interest on loans, and a clear dividend of 4 per cent. upon the paid-up share capital to the shareholders. WORCESTER AND HEREFORD. It is stated that, although the funds necessary for completing a double line throughout from Worcester to Hereford are not available, sufficient means are at command to construct a single line throughout, and that it will thereforce be commenced forthwith. The inhabitants of Ledbury, who would be excluded from the benefit of commrunication if the scheme were to stop at falverm as proposed, intend to oppose the abandonment of any portion of the line, if persisted in.

LONDON. MOAVDAY, JANUARY 21, 185. At length we have received the correspondence referred to in the MIessage of the Pnsiromx of tlte United States with regard to the dispute between England and America on the Central American question. The documents are extremely volminous; but we can, in a very few sentences, give Dur readers an account of the real matter in dapute between the two countries. Great Britain in possesed of a settlement at Belize, on the coast Df Central America, the right to occupy which For certain purposes was conceded to her by spain in the treaty of 183, reserving, however, ho the CRowi- of Spain full and unuiminished 3overeignty over the district. Great Britain has --so possessed, for raany years, the right of pro~ection over the MIosquito Indians-a barbarous =ace that wanders at wi'l over tha coast of a onsiderable portion of t' * al Amerfa. GreatBritain had also occupied the fint, island of Ruatan, placed in a commanding situation in' the Bay of Honduras. This was the state of things in 1850, when the attention of both Governments was draw,n, by the discovery and rapidly increasing wealth of California, to the growing importance of the road across the isthmus which led to that golden region. Hence resulted the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, negotiated between Mr. Czaros and Sir Hmmy BuLWER in April, 1850, the first article of which declares-"That the "United States and Great Britain agree that "neither will occupy, or fortify, or colorize, or assume or exercise any dominion over Nica"ragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast, or any "part of Central America. Nor will either make "use of any protection which either nffords, or "may afford, or any alliance which either has, or "may have, to or with any State or people, for "the purpose of occupying, fortifying, or colo'nizing Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito "Coast, or any part of Central America, or of "assuming or exercising dominion over the "msame." Notwithstandinge, this treaty the British Government still retain possession of Rvuatan, still occupy Belize, and stiU retain the protectorate over the Mosquito Indians. It is not disputed that all these places are within Central America. The Government of the lJnited States waive any claim to the evacuation of Belize, but insist upon our abandoning the protection of the Mosquito Indians and the possession of Ruatan Island. And now our readers are as fully in posesson of the real merits of the controversy as if they had waded through those twelve columns of very closely printed matter into which the rival Governments have found it possble to condense their remarks, and may by their own firesides decide the controvery for themselves. It is doing the American Minister and his Government onlyjustice to say that they urge their clain with great moderation of tone and temperance of language, appealing only to reason, and discarding all topics of an exciting and irritating nature. On the part of England it is urged that the treaty was never intended to apply to existing rights, but only to such interests as might arise by anv future acunisition of Grpet T'ithfn. E-T AmerTcan Miui , on the other hand, contends that the words of the treaty are clearly large enough to include Ruatan and the Mosquito protedorate, and that the intention of the treatyis to be gathered from its own Ilangguage, and not from any collateral writings or circumstances, We do not intend to offer any opinion on the subject, but we may re- mnark that it was a most.extraordinary omision of . the Eng1ish-Plenipotentia3s, whiI6 using*ords so wide and comprehensive, not to have saved, bya express proviso, the existing inteests of Gf-at Britain, if such had been bis intention, and it u not wonderful that the Americans, when renouncing all right of interference in Central America, should have expected a imilar concession from Great Britai. 'Without, however, offering an opinion on ths interpretation of the treaty,-in our point of view, a matter of very secondary importance,. we may presume to offer a few words of advioe to the Goverrment and the nation. The matter in dispute is ludicrously disproportioned to the dimensions of the interests engaged in it. Here are two of the greatest nations of the world, posseasing between them the greatest share of its maritime commecee, approaching to the very verge, of a qua=rol about matters to an ordinary apprehension of the most' extrome insignificance. Whjt possrKe advantage can Englhnd derive from- tho pfobtEctorato of the 'Mosquito; tertithry, or the eizure zo t'ae island of -Ruatan, for of her rights over Belize, paltry as they are, there is no qutestion? It is, no doubt, a very glorious thinu to cary off His Mosquito Majesty to Jamaica, and then, after he has recovered the effects of his three or four days devotion to the celebrated rum of that island, to stuff his sable limbs into a Generars uniform, to crown him with a cocked hat, to anoint him with palm oil out of a calabash, to put a sugarcane as a sceptre into his hand, ana to send him back to his naked subjects with all the solemnities that can wait on protected roalty; but surely even this gratification and that of occupying the, island of Ruatan may be bought too dear. All the advantage that we could hope to attain from these dubious and ill-defined rights over remote and unhealtly districts is, that by being first in the field we may prevent the Americans from anticipating us in obtaining exclusive possession of the transit over the Isthmus of Darien. That nothing of the 3ind will be attempted we have the guarantee of the CIAToN-BUnwxs treaty,the provisions of whichthe American Government has evinced no inclination to inringe, and any future infraction of which we possem both the right and the power to prevent. Once secure on this point, we might leave the care of the moras of the Mosquito Indians to themselves, and rcstore the island of Buatan to its primitive desolation, without any perceptible diminution of the power or presige of the British monarchy. In the meantime, by adhering tenaciously to these barren and worthless rights we are run. ning some risk of forfeiting the very objects to secure which we retain them. America is never wanting in a race of hardy and adventurous piraes, ready to undertake any enterpriso, however dc2perate, and cary it out by aly means, however crimnal. Such x horde of civilized barbarians co-operating withS the Americtm Transit Company has just taken possession of tie State .! Nicatragua, under the leadership of Colonel WAnLEin, and, while we are debating- about the uIosquita protectorate' and the islaad of Ruatan, seems not unlikely to accomplish the very mischief, by the establisibent of an Amaerican State on the Ene of t3ansit, against -which the CLAvToxn-Bvnwrt treaty was intende to gunad. WVe apyrehend it ii the duty oP theI United Stater to put db-vn by miliftary force tlese disgpaceful enterprises, where men possessed of no other merit than ferous courage disgrace their country.' and their racawby every' aesies of craelty and opresaion, and continualty embroil the relations of the Union with f6refi countries. But while we are- at isa' with the American Gavernment as to our pau of the treaty it is vain to expect that they will incur either trouble or unpopu- larity in punishinga such of their citizens as areviolafing- it. proviiions on thir own account. The suggestinou2 then, we would offer is simply this --lLet us take our stand on the literal ccn4truction of the CaAyrToN-BEuvw treaty, which saconlishies for us all that wa can reasonably desire in. Oenral America. Let us frankdy give up ow que3tizable right to the Mosquito protecterate- eal the islancd of Ruatan, an1d, by way of deEivering ourselves of the whcle embarrasment i: once and for ever, throw the worthleum settlement of Belize: mito the bargain. I In returns, let us call upon the American GovernI ment nao only to observe is portion of the treaty, in respect of which we have hitherto had noshing to complain, but al5o to root out the gang off pirates and mnurderoi who have taien forcible-possession of the Stale of Nicaragua, and hold it in defiance of the w4A of both cotuntries. Such an example would do moaei to carry out. the intention of the treaty thain any amount of jirotection to dranken savages on- occupation of w:cntliless islands.' _-
To those who have heard in the recenieonmpaints of military mismanagement merely a dVinoeratic cay it may be a qeonslation to find that in a Republic there is also a " system" and a " cold " shade of axistocracy.! England does nokt. stand alone in unpreparedmass for the sudden o<Atbreak of war; aged commaasders, middle-aged suNaltems, unrewarded merit, disappointed hopes, and, we cannot doubt, hertburnings, bitterness, and evil-spealing, exist in the service of a State which proclaims the equlty of all and the extinction of any aristocracy but that of nature, It is not with a wish to retaliate the jibes of Americans, and to curb the exultation with wbich many of them have regarded our failures, that we point to the testimony of. their own authoaities to sirilar defects among them; nor, on t'he other hand, do we w%ish to make it appear that such unfitness for war must necessarily be the result of a long peace, and that our own country has only pawsed through a phase which was necessary, and might have been foreseen. The facts which have just been published concerning the Amercan navy are valuable to us as well as to the Americans, and we therefore call attention to the narrative. Mr. Secretary DoBBna, of the Naval Department, has addoessed a long report to the Prunrnrr of the United States. Very voluniiinous is he in- describing the doings of various sloops and steamers scattered over the globe under several -Commodores. Hb then approaches the great subject of naval reform. An act was lately passed for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the navy. ..Under its provisions 15 officers sat as a ! board of inquiry, -and seem to have done their duty with no light hand. After a careful examnination no less than 201 officers were found incapable of performing duty afloat. Some were reserved on -c leave of absence pay," some on "furlough pay," while 49 were altogether struck off the rolls. The vacancies were filled up by promotions in order of seniority. The meaning of this official account is, that about half the officers of the American navy were struck off adive service on the ground of incapacity. We have also heard it said that a large proportion of those who remained were almost an inef oiont, -bu that it -w impoeiblu for the commission and the GaovernWnent to proceed further without almost extinguishing the navy. The evil must have been great when the remedy is so violent. It was said by the opponents of the measure that only a sinaU number of officers were inefficient. "But, if that " had bein. the case," says the Seretry, ". would committees session after seion have pressed the "rmeasure P . - It appesas that grave members even proposed to bdiabnd the whole iiavyaa to begin 4freah. -, Thg:presm iA- evextow.n and village ful" eaminAe its thunders fori reform." "I It had "become manifesf to all that somothing raidical, "thorough, and searching. must be administered *to rescue the navy fiom the dangera that im"peiflled it:" * It is singuar to finl that among a people at peace with all the world, busy with the development of their country's resourcesf, and with a firm faith in voluntary efforta when war really comes, there should. have arisen an outcry for the reform of fho services almost as general as that which : great war and .the .destruction of half an army has caused in England.. Yet the tone of the officil document we have, quoted. will, show low sirong must have been the feeling. If -this te the style oE a report, what must have beehn " the thunders f' of the press.!" Indeed, sme of the articles in | AmericJn ournals resemble the British philippio3 of a year ago. It is complained that the Commo. doro auid those who suitain him at home have no world beyond tho quarterdeck. " No one will re.cognize it the common sailor the possible Lieu"' tenant or Captain." "AAmidships there is a groat "gulf fixed.t" Remove every barrier between thoe orecastlo and the cabin if you wish -to ha ve an effective force. At present there is a degrading distinction' between the man and the. gentleman. lVhy shall not " the' rough-handed man" of-war's man be summoned from before the "C mast to* the fellowship and converse of "- the Captain's cabin ?" There exists no reason except the "strong prejudice of routine, " of habit, and of aristocratic sentunent." It will be seen from' this Utopian style of writing that our brethren of the New World have their demands for administrativo reform. Whether they will introduce any such changes as the journalist wlhom we have quoted contemplates we cannot tell, still less would wre venture to assert that the means proposed would solve. the difficulty, but certainly there xeems a niecessity for some plan whiich will supply a duto number of yotng and skilful officers. From the showing of their own authorities, tho Americans have allowed routine and incapacity almost to destroy the service of which they boast so 'much. On the increase of the lravy the Secretary has much to say. Ho advisxe, tho immediate consatruction of steam sloops, each carTying about 20 gun, but with a light draught of water. He points out the differnceo between voltmrteer service by land and sea, and urges lhis (Toverunient not to trust too much to the 5ud(hden enthmsiasm of tlhe people. The coutttry, he says, is not better prepared for war now than it was ih 1812. Ho argues that a weak inavy i; worse than none, for recent occuirrences in EUtrope have showni that it may be leccomary to dlotroy stuch atin insllieidlent force, to avoid enriohiig the enemy by its capture. The Secretary theln pssies to the political aslpct of afair.s. Ho shares in a feeling fromn wrhich few ArneTicans are exernpit.

Sir EDW.xPe BT ran appears to; have been somewhat premature, as far as order of publication is concernecl, in giving the title of the Last of the Ardic Voygegs to his two recent volumes. Dr. XA,ws very remarkable expedition up Smith's Sound will, no doubt, furnish another tale of romantic adventure and hardship in these icy regions. It will be rememboered that in the summer of 1852 Commander DiGuFmEm, having failed in discovering any traces of Sir JoHN FAxxr in Wolstenholme Sound, and seeing the water before him clear of ice, made a bold dash. up Smith's Sound. . On the 27th of August, at noon, the Isabel had reached 78° 28' N. At this point this enterprising young officer could discern no obstacle to his northerly progress-nothing was before him but loose ice. A contrary breeze, horwever, which soon freshened up into a contrary gale, sprang up, and the Isabel was fairly driven to the southward. We note these facts the more particularly as these very waters were the scene of Dr. K&x's recent exploits in the United States' brig Advance. That *gentleman left New York on the 30th of May, 1850, and on the 7th of August of the same year passed the headland of Smith's Sound. He penetrated beyond the highest point attained by Captain I-orzLErImD, and the same spectacle was presented to his eye which his predecessor had beheld. Open water was before him. Dr. KA= might have used the very language employed by captain IsonasnanD on the formWzn occasion to express his own feelings. " I involuntarily cr" claimed," wrote Captain IrrNLxiD on entering the Sound, "that this must lead to the great "Polynia of the Russians, and as the eye streameed "forward into the clear expanse of apparently "open water, which now occupied from seven to "eight points of the compans due north of our "position, Icould not but adxiiit to my mind that"a a great sea: wvas beyond.;" Dr. KE&Txs onward progress was wiowever, retarded -by-abelt of zheavy stream ice, followled by a drifting.pack. Hisp objeet,: of course, was to push through the paeo:i-dt:'at 78 45' the drifting ice caught the brig, and drove her on to the Greenland coast. By great efforts, on the 29th of August he regained his former position, and then started with boat and sledge to aelect afitting ipot for a winterencampment. The adventurers reached a cape 1;100 feet in height, and from this spot gazed around- them upon thle aw solitudes of the PEolai Sea. There was a dark glacier, whichterminated the view on the Greenlanid siae. Hugeicebergswqre driving hither and thitheria the channel, while far, far away to the northward, 5 frozeni sea, like the sea which PAnnY travelled wpon durnng his asdvaiice frorn-Spitzbergen, was all that could be seen. At a spot called Reussellaes Rarbour, amid a group .of rocky. isl.et, the brig "was frozen * in, and imlmedia-tely parties were despatched in 'various dittitn.; In this wray the Greenl%n COt was followed northerlj aad easterly for 12t mniles, wlin zU thought of further discovery for 'that season was stopped by the disappeartnce of Ithe sUn. For 12D days the lumainary zemainoS below the horizon, ana the adventurers were left to the unutterable dreariness of an Arctic winter. The nature and extent of the hardships to which they were exposed may be inferred from S few of the xcientif cphenomena mentioned by Dr. "-E. The mnean temperature of the "pt sielected for the wtler encampment appeared to be 20° lower than the mean temperature of Melville islana, aid we know the terrible intensity of the -cold it that place. 'lThe lowest point registered on the thermometers wam 700 of Fahrenheit, and that wma in February. Chloroform froze, cssential oils becanme solid and liquid, and on the 24th of Fe1ebruary, writec Dr. KANi, '-' chloric ether Was " congealed, for the first timc, by natural tempe" rature." It is satisfactory to find that the great clteu of Arctic navigation-as it was in former days tlhe curse of navigation gencrally-the scurvy, was by these adventurers entirely conquered. 'TVis, liowever, wan replaced by a particular typc of Spalsmodic diseame wlich appears to have occmsioned great ufeldeuig and annoyance. The dogs were attacked, and no fewer than 67 of theme usdul aninuils perimhed with every isymptoin of hydrophobia. Extreme cold had produced the effect of extreino heat. The winter, however, wm passed in one fashion or aiother, and with returniing spring travelling parties were arranged, and expeditions organized. The moot itnportant of these was pushed forward in a northerly direction. The result is njoted by Dr. KANE in the foHowing wordx :-" Openi water washed the ahores of the "' chanmel, anid terminiated in a sea, the heavy to urf of which checkod all fuither progreos." The fsrtheAt point attained was a cape in 1st. 81I 22' N., antd lon]g. 65' 35'. W. PAnyt'x furthest poilt wlheti le conducted lhis memorable sledge_ boat expedition from Spitzbergen was 820 40' 23" N., in long. 190 25' E. No successor on the path of Arctic adventure has yet snatched his claplet from the brow of that great navigator. PAmny is still the champion of the North. It was gracefully done on the part of Dr. KA2Ew, that he named the most distant mountain which they could disern with their instrumenta after Sir EDWAiD PAiRY. This mountain lies, by estimate, in lat. 82° 30' N., and was only discerned, not -isited. Winter after winter passed away in such occupations, and it was not until the slzmmer of 1854 that Dr. KAE finaly determined upon retracing- his steps. It was necessaryto abandon I the good ship which had so long been their home, I and on the 6th of August in the year 1854 thie voyagers reached the Danish settlement of IUpernavik, 83 days after leaving their ship. Such appear to be, in as succinct a form as we can give them, the principal facts of this remarkable expedition, in wlich great dangers were confronted with singular ccGrage, great hardships endured with unflinching fortitude, and great sucoess achieved by a combinatiou of all the qualities wich have distinguished theLmost daringamong Arctic voyagers. If we awo next to say what advantage has resulted ta the world from this cievement, we are compeled to say that the result does not appear corumensurate with the dangers incurreL The voyage was, however, undertaken, like so many others, for the purpose of seeking for traces of Sir Joiv FRiAXwI and his illfated companions.. We now know that they are not to be looked for in this or in any other direction. Dr. K&?ia, however, waw as ignorant as. the rest of the world upon this point when he threw himself into the ice upon his philanthropic errand. All honour to him, then, for his courage am]. perseverance! It was no, fa-alt of his that he was not the man destined to discover the nielarscholy- relics which have at length changed eon4ecture into cerlainty asfaras FRAxKLix is concerned. If we look at the result of' the expedition from other points of vier, we confess -ourslves wholly unable to dircover what adntage wil result to the world from the confirnnaon oi Captain* IrGuEr=s discoveries. up Ssith'! Sonud. Scientifiemen,who make such pursits their business, may no doubt bo -able to indicate some alight advantages to the hydrographer and natural philosopher as the consequence of Dr. Kixx's voyage; but are these at all sufficient to counterbalace tbhe risks incurred and the perils run by men of such hardihood and note ? How are we benefited if at a future day we even reeeive plenary prwf that there is a Polar Sea within 800 N. ? If it exists, can it be navigated ? Hitherto all atteMpts to penetrate its secrets have just sufficed to bring the explorers upon the frin&e3 of this hypothetical sea. One adventurer may. advance a few minutes more north tnan his predecessors, but what then ? All we know as certainty is, that within the circle of 800 N. there is a region which, under no appreciable circumstances, can ever bo turned to account by man. It may contaix a little more rock, or a little more water, but water and rock 'in such latitudes are alike useless to the human family.

S SECOND EDITIoN* THE Tit.E5 OFFICE, ModnjMot, IEXPRESS FROMPARIS.: The following is the letter of our Pails correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. - The Paris population, with the quick: and tn. reflecting character which hs ever marked them, which sinks in despondency under adversity, and becomes too buoyant in prosperity, looks upon peace as already a fait accompli; receives with impatience and even irritation, not merely the expresion of the slightest doubt, but the wholesome coumsel that it is unwise and undignified to snatch at it as if they were on the very verge of rain. Among those whose cry is theloudest inthis und gifibdclamnour aresome who estimate peace or war only as it is likejy to filltheir pockets; wholaugh at patriotism andpublie spirit as objects only for the admiration of fools, who would be the first to " fraternize" with Daussiam or any one else to-niorrow, and to whom a rise or fall at the Bourse is of far more interest than the most righteous cause for which mSn ever drew hiis sword. Sachmon, who are the sat isfail under-any circumstance, are, I suppose, to be foundin all countries. On public calamities they prosper; political immnorality is their calling, and to them a calling of profit. These perions, devoid of all sentiment that has not reference to a iausse or a baisae, exhibit the most indecorous impatience of peace 4 touit lrix, and as they are supposed, no doubft erroneously, to have influence in high quarters, and as they are sure to encourage that idea rather than to check it, thle iinpression is produced that they but reflect the opiniors of the most exalted personages. Thix does not appear to be the disposition of the Government of the Emperor, so far Vs can be ascertained. It is admitted, I aniL informed, that the chances in favour of peace are many; but there is no such undignified readiness to declare that nothing can or shall occur to prevent it.. It is believed in high quarters that Russia has accepted without arriire pensfe the propositiori the allies have proposed. 1 use the term the allies have proposed, because, though Austria was the mouth-piece on the occasion, the conditions of peace were hers only in form. Whatever part more or less important she may have taken; to what extent soever may have lent her initiative; whether the original idea of them wns started at Vienna, whether they were concocted there, at Paris, ot at London, the three Powers unquestionably ndade them their own before they were presanted at. St. Petersburg. The term Avnsfriat proposals v.as bui; one of form: from the circumstance of Austria not being-Y one of the belligerents, and not having broken off her diplomatic relations with Russia, she was-the only ally that could do so; and I presnme we are as much bound by them as if we had directly offcred them in our olwn name. The preliminaries of peace are already signed, or Wil soon be so, and negotiations will commence forthwith. Several places have been mentioned as the most suitable for this new operation-Paris, London, Vienna, and Drescen. It has also been said that the English Government has no objection to Paris, and the Frendi to London. I doubt whether such be the fact. I am led to believe that the French Governmient hava made and intend making no demand that Faris shall be selected, though they would not cerainlly declinea proposal to that effect. It is desirable that Paris or London should be the spot. It would be the crowning act of the policy of the allies thatthe negotiationsfor a durable peace shouldbe conducted and concluded in the capitd of either of the two nations that have compelled Russia to accept it- on their own terms. It wouldbe anadditionalproof to the world, if any proof were required, of the speriority of the allies over their enemy. I may say one word on a subject which.is of iiportance, particularly as I am welf 'aware that efforts are now making, and will be made in :the course of the negotiation, by false friends and open enemies, to create a misunderstanding between France and England; and no instrunent is considered too base for that object. There may have been, and there still may-be, some points where complete accord does not prevail; bttt I hardly believe that these points are of importance, and I cannot doubt that the Emperur himself and' hi Government are, as ever, determined to maintaisx the allance with England through good report innl evil report. In privatelife, beweenthebestfriertd,. there are moments of coldness which it woulZijodifficult to assign to any e(a cause in particQvc But these moments pass away, and the nual. esteem, withoutwhich real friendship cannot Msbei0s4 without speakimg of necessity, always sur&4ea t prevent a separation Of the fifth condition res* , by which the allied Powers reserve to thp_l'ea the right of makdng other propositionas %ve! :and above the four guartees little is now aid. -e fa set aside as Russia demanded in her modi;Atij,, to those conditions? This I cannot answer ; nlit-her can I positively affirm what are the pow _tons referred to. The reconstruction of the fortress of Bomarsund has been spoken of As i'ended to be prohibited by that clause. It _a w ed here, that to insist on the acceptance of tbho f ftf unki:own, as of the four known, conditions, . in point of fact, be equivalent to a ecO# . Uuiat, which, if the principle were ever allow'd, might be followed by a third and a fourth, &ni'i that the object of the war is completely attaine# without it. Wuhether Bomarsunlxw was or was not to be intro-. duced into the clasav-, it is not forgotten that-from the Aland Iles t ;a 'Stockholm the distance by seam is but eight halu.ff, and the allies may have to consder whethe?, 'as we have induced Sweden to join ouralance'a,Td to do whatthegwedesthemselves regardas finralitylifttle les than ahostile declaration, that -cowUr try ought to be left defenceless against a Po'wrr which seldom pardons or forgets an injluy or a slight. It is true that Sweden is protet -dc so far as a treaty with England and France PXf,tects her, but shouldRussix ever have the oppor._ t anity for revenge treaties wonidbe no more obstale to her than they ever have been in the intliction of wrong. Russia has accustomed us to the term materint gquaranfees -the non-construction o any military stronghold in parts so close to the Swedist ooast would be the best security. An armistice will follow the signature of the preliminaries of peace.

.THER ARMY- IN THE 7CRMEA. - .. (pnom OUR-OWN CORUESPONDVNi CAMP13EFORE SEBASTOPOI, JAR. 4. We have had a6heavy siowitorm last night and this morning. The fallihas ceased, but the snowlies several inches deep on the plateau.. On the white surface the irregular collections of huts have something the appearance of groups of farmbuildixigs, while the more distant tents, dingy in comparison with the dazzling -whiteness of the ground, might be taken for heaps of hay or manure. On all sides, at the distance of about three-quarters of a mile, our horizon is limited by a haze a few. shades grayer than the snow and semi-transparent, so that figures are dimly seenI walking within it. The wind howls drearily round the huts, but the snow lends lght to tho foreground, and the temperature is milder than it has been for the last few days-far milder than it was on the 2d, a piercing day of frost, wind, and sleet. Fatigue parties, in their short fur-lined coats, their heads protected by those black sealskin caps the shape of which reminds one of iictures of Russian travelling, bring up firewood on their shoulders to the different commissariat stores, and a considerable amount -of snowb3ling goes on -among them in the intervals of their toiL Eere and there carts move slowly through the deep snow, in which, hard by my window, some Tartar dogs are now disporting themselves, apparently quite in their ele-. 'ment. - The winter piece is complete, and not unpicturesque. But it suggests a wish that the whole, instead of part only, of our army had more substantial shelter than tents against the sharp wind, the drifting snow, the bitter cold that will attend a return of frost, and the chilly floods which a thaw mustinevitablybring. Wellprovidedinmostessential respects the soldiers certainly a~-well clothed and we elfed; but it seems strange that by this time they should not all have been hutted. Huts are getting up, however, with great rapidity along the road to B3La1lava one daily meets thousands of men bringing up the planks on their shoulders, and it is to be hoped that before the heavy rains set in there nill bo few under canvass. The amount of labour that has been expended on this British camp in the Crimea is enormous. It would have built a city of no mean aspect in some more favoured situation, where materials were less difficult to obtain and easier of transport. It has built a towna scattered and irregular one, spread over a large surface in many groups. Besides the numerous wooden buildings, there are not a few of stonesmall, but snug and well-built edifices, quite able to resist even Crimean rains and winds, and fitted, many of them, with fire-grates from SebastopoL If the army were to quit the Crimea, leaving its stone and earthen huts standing, many a Tartar would find abetter dwelling than he, perhaps, had ever before enjoyed, and would marvel at the ingenious. and comfortable contrivances of the invader. Some of the stables, too, are wonderfully perfect and well contrived, and must have cost an immensity of labour. I rode down, a day or two ago, into the valley towards Karanyi, where the heavy batteries are, and saw some truly admirable stables. The stalls were paved; there was a clean path down the centre; there were racks for the hay and well-made wooden mangers, bound and striped with the iron bands that confine the compressed trusses-excellent mangers-economical of corn, and which the horses cannot bite. It had been found that the horses sometimes pushed out the planks of the stable huts, so stone walls were built up outside to a sufficient height to prevent this. In short, although somo of the men were still under canvass, the horses of the artillery in question could hardly be better cared for, and the condition of those I saw corresponded with the pains that had been taken to protect and preserve them. The health of the camp continues good. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the average amount of sickness does not exceed, if it quite reaches, 10 per cent. But a large proportion of the cases are of a trifling nature, and the mortality is small. We must be prepared to expect some increase when the rains return, but we may venture to hope that this will not be great, since the men are well provided and, as it appears to me, in excellent condition and good spirits. The bringing up of planks from Kalaklava and the other necessary fatigue duties give them suflicient exercise to keep them in health; for the recruits there is' squad ani adjutant's drill, when the weather permits; and drlunkenness, from all I can learn, is much-less rife than it wa2s last autumn. T am assured that the averige amount of punishment for drunkenness having lately been computed, was found not to exceed a half per cent. per dienm-a small percentage-to which, however, must be added a somewhat larger' one for men. who'get drunk and escape punishment. There can be no doubt that in the autunm issues of back pay and the difficulty of transmitting money aggravated the eviL JA-N. 5. Nothing new since yesterday.

There is, it seems, a prospect of the actual result -of the mission of the late Mr. Lucas to the Court of Rome being made known to the public at large. The Tablet of this day says itis stated on the highest authority that Bishop Walsh, the defendant in the case of " Lucas v. Ossory," has been summoned to Rome, and that the venerable prelate's departure cannot be fiutrther delayed. PRESTS AND THEMR TENANTs. The Anglo Cdt, ultra-Liberal and something more, calls attention to a remarkable instance of the relation between landlord and tenant which came before the last quarter sessions of Cavan. The lords of the soil who figured as appellants in the case -alluded to were neither Orange gentry of the old stock nor Saxon interlopers freshly iinported from the Encumbered EstatesCourt, but two well-to-doparish priests of the Roman Catholic persuasion, one of them the Rev. Mfr. Sheridan of Kingstown, near Dublin, the other a pastor in the diocess of Meath. 7he story of the tenants' grievances is an old and familiar one, and easily told. They had held lands under the Court of Chancery at 30s. per acre, which lands were subsequently disposed of in the Courts, the two clergymen becoming the purchasers; having no leases, the tenants were induced to put in proposals to the rev. proprietors for the farms which they had so long occupied, at an increased rent of 18s. the acre, as the alternative of clearing out, if they did not flike the termn; for a long time they struggled on; in the end they found that the bargain was a bad one, and that they couldnot poythestipulated rent. The priests, like other ordinary mortals, appealed to the law, and obtained redress, and now a meaningless outcry fs raised against the rev. gentlemen, as though they had committed some crime of fearful magnitude by their courageous refusal to sacrifice the undoubted rightsof property, even at the risk of being marked ojects of popular odium, if wth no worse consequences in prospective. TEE 3URDL OF Iss Esr-Dg. The Aiiglo Cdt, referring to the recent arrests, observes "The prisoners are kept it solitary confnement- the Boman Catholic chplain hMs been denied access to them, and they were prevented from attending mass on Sunday-a matter which has been reported to the Government.

FOREI0N INLTL?LLIGF2TE.1 . FANCE I tIROM OUR OWN CO3PONDES.J I [A i ortlon of the follwing appeared in our second edi. tion ofSataday -I PARIS, FRIDAY, JAr. 18, 6 P.M. The news of, the acceptance by Russia. of the Austrian propositions certainly justifies the satisfaction, the enthusiasm I may say, with which it was received, and which stil continues; and it may be considered ungracious to. say. anything,which would dimninish so. pleasing an effect. It is much more agreeable to believe that everything will -go on smnoothly, and that Rumia will start no difficulty in: the conferences whichIpresumewiU soonopen. We must not, however, forget, in the exultation of the moment, that we have to deal with a Power whose Perfidy ison a par with her ability. This great culprit must be watched with incessant and untiring vigilance. An old offender against the law excites the compasion and forgiveness of the generous public when he imrplores a, mitigation of punisnment by the most affecting-ropentance forpast misdeeds, and the most solemn and apparently sincere promises of amendment for the future; but he is nevertheless still placed under the surreilkance of thepolice. The modification to the propositions, which I transmitted yesterday, will doubtless be considered as superseded bythe "pure and simple"acceptance of Russia, but it is not improbeble that she will do her best to obtain these or similar modifications during the conferences. Ybu will have observed that as to the 5th proposition, in which the allied Powers reserve to themselves the right of making other propositions over and above the guarantees, Russia demanded its suppression on account of its vagueness, and the discussion onit inafuture congress. Nowit isdesirabletoknowwhetherthis 5th proposition is comprised inthe acceptance of Russia; and, if it is comprised, does it mean that she merely accepts " purely and simply" the "reserved right" of the Powers'to make undefinied propositions, andnotthe propositions themselves, whatever they may turn out to be? It is one thing to admit the right to present a certain proposal, and another to bind oneself to accept what is proposed. The despatch informs us that Russia accepts these 'propositions as "preliminaries of peace." In discussing preliminaries a difference of opinion may arise, which could not on the propositions themselves. In one of the modifications of Russia, or, as they have been termed, cou,nerpropositions, respecting the engagement not to create nor maintain military arsenals, &c., she adds "on the banks or coasts of the Black Sea." It may become a matter for discussion whether lNicholaieff, where her naval docks are, should be considered as on the coast of the Black Sea. This will perhaps be considered too critical, and would be so if we had any other Power to deal with thau Russia; but it ought not to be forgotten that Russia also accepted, without reserve, this time twelvemonth, the four guarantees proposed by the Powers, and then flung them back in our faces at the Conferences of Vienna. In taking notice of these circumstances I echo the opinion of persons who are not generally pessimists, and who are pleased to look on the fair side of things. On the other hand, it is but right to say that matters have changed much with us, as with Russia, since the Vienna Conferences; and that, under ordinary circumstances, we are justified in considering that the definitive conclusion of peace is not far distant. In the first months of 1855 Central Europe was in a state of hesitation, and was rather hostile than friendly to the poEcy of the Western Powers. At the present moment Russia finds it, if not entirely arrayed aggainst her, at least seriously divided, and perhaps ready to declare its refusal to persist in a degrading neutrality. The attitude recently assumed by Austria I still believe to have done much, and I am this day again assured that Austria has given assurancesthat she would be with us in the field, and willbe, in case of necessity. It has been stated that the Vienna Cabinet expressed her intention, on account of the mild and conciliatory tone of the reply of Count Nessehrode not to withdraw her Ambassador from St. Petersb urg in1consequence -of the non-acceptance of the propositions; but it is, on the other hand, aflirmedthat AL detuol declared positively to Prince Gortschakoff that he need not take the trouble even to receive and transmit the propositions of the Czar, for that on the 18th the whole of the Austrian Legation had orders to quit the Russian capitaL It was, if I am correctly informed, on the receipt of this announcement, that the Russian Govermunent found that nothing less than an unconditional acceptance would be received by Austria, that 3I. de Nesselrode resolved, without waiting the expiration of the period granted him, to adhere at once,. purely and simply, to the conditions of theellirn1atun. It remains to be seen whether Russia wil accept the details as unconditionally as she has done the principle. It is undeniable, then, that the situation of the parties respectively has undergone: a con-. siderable change since last year. In appearance, and it is to be hoped in reality, the hesitations of the more important States of Europe have been modified, but not in favour of Russia. What was ambiguous in the terms previously demanded has been niade more precise and less difficult to be understood& But, while it iscertain that the chances of a complete understanding are greater than before, it would stiU be foolish to give way to an inconsiderate enthasiasm, and to consider peace as in fact re-established from the day Russia announces her acceptance. We must stili be on thewvatchi; and until the treaty of peace is actually sigued, sealed, and delivered, we should not relax in our preparations for all contingencies. A letter from Constantinople of the 3d says as follows "The disclosures in 27e Times respecting the pernicious charater of the Austrian occupation in the Moldo-Wallachian Principalities have excited much interest here among all who, like as, know but too well the truth in its sad reality. We are pleased to think that the truth is becoming Imowvn, and, that it will excite the sympathies of the civilized world. The semi-official press of France alone appears, perhaps owing to want of infonnation, to hes.tate admitting that this occupation, prolonged for such a time, must be dangerous to public security in the provinces. In Fzance they do not seem to be aware that it becomes critical for the alies themselves, and that they expose themselves to the charge, unjust, no doubt, of having abandoned that unfortunate country to the oppression of an arny of which it cannat be said that it is friendly or hostile to the Porte. A French journal, when recently relating the actsof violence perpetrated by a superior oflcer of the Austrian anny on the person of a French protgg6, and of which the agent of France could hardly be ignorant, tried to palliate the facts by insinaating that they were possibly exaggerated-as if such acts were of rare occurrenea in the Pincijpalities since the Austrian occupation. Here, at Stanboul, such. a state or things in the rrxzdputic i, but too well known, but the Porte cau apply no remidy unless aidedby the allies. "The Government of Moldavia keeps the Porte well informed of all these acts, which prove the great difficulty of its position in presence of the Austrian occupation, which does not evenTespect the conventIon concluded with the Moldaviani Govemment, and daily gives the lie to the most formal assurances contained in the Austrian proclamations on the eintzy of ihe army into the provinces. It is, moreover, notorious that the frank and loyal conduct of the Moldavian Government differs essentially from that of ths Walachiali Hiospodar, who is the silent accomplice of those who oppress the country , :7"'Amonglbe Various- documenits which have. been trans. miiit,t did t, She'P,orte',rithe Moldaviai vramn, ent; ndr-e- s p e cial .

The propositions of the three allied Cabinets, accepted purely and simply by tho Cabinet of St. Petersburg, offer an excellent basis for the Aecotiatin, whi9h Will now open in ?a m 4tIai t.y be.!ti thu itrested Powers. We have arrived at the preliminaries of peace ; this is a happy, an immense fact; ,We nay alnost say it is the peace ; for at this point we cannot believe otherwise than tbat the prelminaries of peace must necesarily lead to peace itself. In announcing this result we congratulate France and all Europe. We also con. gratulate those allied L>owers which have produced this resiult,;oithei by their resolution displayed in the var, or by their firmness in the pacific negotiations. Finally, there would be injustice in not renderinghonour to Russia, for the spirit of concilhation and wisdom brought by her into the late negotiations has contributed largely to prepare tho happy result.- The Unian is less extravagant, and contains the followving.- e " t is useless to describethe impression produced by this despatch. It has put a stop to the doubts entertained with respeotto the reply of Russia; it has dissipated the fears, reassured the minds of all, and has given life to hopes which hitherto had only appeared in order to vanish at once. If this inteligence is not peace, it is at least a great step to. wards a pacific solution." The ConstitrtionneZ will doubtless present the public with its views in its next impression. That journal confines itself to-day to a self-laudatory statement-scarcely justified, we may add-to the effect that the present result was anticipated by its Vienna correspondent. The Pavls offers the following observations "The first consequence of this resolution will necessarily be the opening of conferences, with the object of regulating the definitive application of the principles now admitted by all parties. If, aswe hope, the adhesion of Russia is with. out second thoughts, if no difficulty is raised in theapplication of those principles, peace will speedily be re-established. AUl Europe will congratulate itself on a result which is duo to the energetic attitude of France, England, and Austria, and to the loyal assistance of a portion of Germany." The S&lcle is alone incredulous, and thus expresses itself:- " We shall be considered very incredulous; it will, perhaps, be repeated that we wish for war at any price-. that we repel even tho very hope of seeing the termination of hostilities, which cest France so many men and so much treasure. This injustice will little affect us-it will not preventusfromsaying, as goodand loyal patriots, totheGoverments of France and England, ' Do not let yourselves be defrauded: be on your guard rW W would also say, not to speculators, who inspire us with no interest, but to honest and serious merchants, 'Be calm in the midst of the feverish agitations of the Bourse. Await the result of the negotiation, and think of the fate of the past negotiations. The issue of the Conferences of 1855 proves that it would bo imprudent to abandon oneself to a confidence which might again be ill-inspired, and it is impossible that the events of the war, that our victories, have not sUggested to the Western Powers fresh exactions in virtue of the reserve made in the treaty of alliance and in the ultimatum of Austria. Let us wait, therefore, with dignity the result of the negotiations.'" The Coutrrier drt Havre says !'

SATURDAr, JAN. 19, 6 p.mr The Minister of Marine has received the follow- - ing report from Captain Gizolme, of the Embuscade corvette, dated " Roadstead of San Francisco, the 3d ult." "Monsieurle Ministre,-I have the honour of informing your Excellency that the French flag has been rehoisted on the Consular establishment at San Francisco. I arrived on the 28th of November off the bar at the entrance of this port, but it was not until the evening of the 29th that I was able to reach the Bay of San Solito, distant six miles from the anchorage of the town. Scarcely had I come to anchor when I received aletter from the American Corn. modore Melvine, the federal authority of the highest rank nowhere, informingme thathe had beenchargedby is Goe vernment to czary into exectLtion the arrangement agreed upon betwven the two countries, and leaving me to fix the day and hour for so doing. In consequence of this friendly announcement from the American authorities, I brought my vessel as near as possible to the frigate Independence, bearing the Commodore's flag. On the 30th, at noon, I was at anchor near the frigate, and before the town. I went immediately -to see the Commodore, and requested that the ceremony should tcke place at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I tlwn apprised IL Dillon of the fact, in order that on theo first gun being fired from the frigate the French flag should be hoisted on his house. At 2 o'clock the Commodore had the courtesy to assemblc his band, and while the French flag was being hoisted at the mizenmast head they played our national airs. A salute of 21 guns was afterwards fired, which I returned with a similar num. ber. When, this act of reparation had been accomplished, I thought it my duty to salute the Commodore's flag with 13 g-us, which he im-ediately returned. I feel bound to in. form yourExcellency that it was impossiblo for any one to havo shovn morecourtesy than was evinced by this superior officer in the execution of the orders of his Government.

MARSEILLES, Jn. 18. The mail steampacket Gange, due here on Tuesday last, arrived at 8 p.m. yesterday. She brought the Constantinople mails of the 7th, and these from the Crimea of the 6th inst. She was delayed on her passage by constant bad weather, particularly in the Dardanelles, where she encountered a furious gale, which lasted three days. Private letters fzram Kinbiu-n, received by the Gauge, state that thq thermometer there mark-ed 27 degrees Rceaumiutbelow zero. Subsequently the ice melted, under the influence of a souitherly wind, and the British and French gunboats 'drifted towards the coast. The Rlssians came down and commenced a cannonade on the gunboats, but were speedily repulsed. Orders have been received by the military authorities here not to ship any more rncried of war to the Crimea. Provisions, however, continue to be forwarded to the army. The American clipper Ocean Herald is to sail on Saturday for Algiers, where she will take a cargo of wheat and proceed to Kamuiesch. The Eailing frigate Reine Blanche c-ft this for Constantinople on Sunday last. The Eritish steaoier Sea Nymph sailed for the same destination yesterday. The British transport Rattler, chartered by the French Government, which sailed from Kamiesch on the 25th of November, arrived here on the 9th inst., having on board 400 tons of old cannon and shot. The steamer Harmonia, Captain Heyman, sailing under the British flag, with a crew of Germans, and likewise chartered by the French Government, arrived here on'Wednesday from Constantinople, which she left on the 6th inst. She landed 257 sick and very severely wounded soldiers. Several of her military passengers died on the voyage. The Caradoc is stiU in the port of the Joliette, waiting for SirE. Lyons, who is expected here on the 25th inst. The weather has been unusually stormy in the Mediterranean for several days past. The mail steamer Alexandre, which sailed for Constantinople' on the 10th inst., was forced to return on the following morning, and to transfer her mails and passengers to the Indus. Tho Languedoc, expected from Oran on the 11th, did not arrive here until the 1Gth. A number of merchant vessels, which cleared out of this port on Wednesday, were forced by bad weather to return and take shelter at the Frioul. A telegrapnic despatch, received here last evening, announcing that the REussian Government had accepted purely and simply the Austrian ultinmatum, produced quite a panic this morning on the cornmarket. Wheat fell 4f. the hectolitre, and there are few purchasers to be found even at that 'reduction. The Municipal Council are about to accomplish some improvements in the hitherto neglected city of Marseiles. They announce that they will shortly confer on the town 100 publc clocks, which are much wanted. It will scarcely be believed in London that there is not a public clock at the Marseilles Post-office. An audacious robbery was committed on Friday night last at the Hotel do Ville. The robbers forced the door of the cash-office, and succeeded in opening the iron safe-with false keys. They extracted from it 136,000f. in banknotes and gold. A consideiable sum in silver, and a number of bonds and other securities i''wre untouched. No trace of the thieves has as yet been discovered. The. following is the traffic of the port of Marseilles. for the first 15 days of the present month. Five -French ships, measLuing 3,648 tons, and 18 foreign vessels, of which14 are American, 1 Neapohtan, 1 Sardinian, 1 Spanish, and 1 Dutch, entered from foreign ports. 10 French ships, measuring 2,425 tons, and 1 British, measuring 517 tons, sailed for foreign ports; 141 French vessels, measuring 23,351 tons, engaged in the coasting trade, with 106 forejoners, of which 11 are British,' 27 Sarinian, 22 Spamiards, 12 Neapoltan, 5 Tuscan, 4 American, 2 Dutch, 2 Norwegian, 1 Jerusalemite, 2 Ottoman, S Greek, 3 Prussian, 4 Roman, 4 Swedish, and 1 Belgian, entered Marseiles. 85 French ships, measuring 17,682 tons, engaged in the coasting trade, with 53 foreigners, of which 6 are lBritish, 9 Sardinian, 9 Spanish, 10 Neapolitan, 8 Tuscan, 1 Akustrian, S Greek, 1 Norwegia, 1 Oldenburgher, 1 American, 1 Swede, 1 Belgsian, sailed from Marseilles. - - - TURKEY. *(FROM OUR OWN coaRscPoNDw-NT.)

IThese early habits, and the privacy with which Orientals love to screen their domestic' life from the prying eye of the foreigner, formed the basis of all police reguLations. The town was divided into small Mahiallas, or quarters, whiere those of the same religin, the same race, and thecsamecpursuits were collected; the gates were shut at night, and the'circulation rendered difficult. PBy this means, and wiath the aid of a. few Zabtics, or 'policemenl, order was nraint&med. - Pers and Galata formed an unenviable exception. The receptacle of the scum of Europe, additional precautions were reqmired. The proportion of Zabtics (polioemen) and Webektshi's (watchmen) was indeed greater than that in other parts of the capital; but the privileges which the subjects of forcign Powers cnjoyed ever since regular missions were established in Turkey were not calculated to give efficiency to the police. As the influence of the foreign nmssions inereased the impunity of excesses in Pera and Galata increased likewise. How could it be expected that the Turkish policeman should do his duty, haunted as he was by the vision of the formidable Tergiuman Boy (interpreter) of some unknown but very troublesome lgy (ambassador), who would not fail to go next morning, to the Pote, and calU down upon his doomed head- summary punishment should he have had the misfortune to touch any ruffian who had acquired, tant bien qiw ,meZ, the exceptional position which foreign protection gives in Turkey. Now thD thing has become ten times *orse, foreign military privilegeshavingbeenadded, sothat between 'thetwo the poorNebekatshi, like allantiquated institutions,' has become an object of ridicule. However ridiculhus these so called guardians of the peace may be, the consequences resulting from such a state of things are by nb means so, as you may judge from the reports of robberies and murders which were recently the order of the day in Pera and Galata . The patroeiuiles, French, English, and Turkish, have indeed succeeded in abating this nuisance, and now we hear no more of them; but there are other dangers of an even mnore serious character in store if measures be not taken to place this petit Paris, as the modest Perotes like to call their town, under a united and organized system of police. The mail from Trebizonde has come in this morning, not bringing much news, except that the Ron. A. C. Murray, the 13ritish AKmbassador, had actually left Teheran on the 6th of last month on his way to A letter. from Trebizonde of the 29th says that information has been received from Erzeroum, according to which General Mouravieff, after destroying part of the fortifications of Kars, had ratired to Guinri, taking with him all the artillery except four guns, which he left with 1,000 men in charge of a colonel in the citadeL As the letters from Erserouns do not mention the subject, the news requires confirmation. Baron de Schwarzenberg and Mrajor Tashler, lately commanding the cavalry at Kars, arrived on the 28th at TIrebizonde. Omar Pasha is stil at Redout KBleh, and the bulk of his army, d cheval, on the road to Kutais. The arrival of Halim Pasha, the commissioner who was sent by the Turkish Government to inquire into the state of things at Batounn, has given new materials for councils of war. They are following each other in quick succession. Colonel Simmons and l!;r. Oliphant, the author of the Sh7ores of Mlze Blacd Sea, who accompanied Omar Pasha's army in Circassia, are going to England by the French mail which leaves to-day. Officers of the Turkish Contingent lately arrived from Kertch speak of an apprehension of a Russian attack. Although we have had very fine wcather for some time, it seems not to have been the case either in the Black Sea or in the Archipelago. Several vessels are reported wrecked; among them the Talavera (Dunbar), in the sea of Marmora; all hands on board saved, but she is a complete wreck. Apprehensions are likewise entertained for the safety of the Great Tasmanian and the Great Republic, which ought to have come in from the Black Sea. The Jouwnal de COosfantinople has a long paraWgph about the construction of a canal from the Danube to the Black Sea, setting forth all the advantages to be derived from such an undertaking. The Imperial firman which grants the right of constructing this canal to a company formed by some financiers of London, Paris, Vienna, and Constantinople was signed on the 4th of January. The question of the electric telegraph which the Turkish Government is anxious to construct has entered into a new phase. The oring project was to make a hne by Shurmla and Rustchuk to Bucharest in connexion -with the Vienna line. Messrs. De la Rue and Black were charged with the execution. The line was completed as far as Shumla, but the project seemed not to prosper as was expected, owing to some reason or other; and now the contract with the two gentlemen Charged with the execution of the project has been cancelled, and the Turkish Government pays an indemnity, and adopts a new and more comprehensive project. Some difficulties which arose vith the contractors are put forward as the cause of the change, but it seems rather strange that they should involve a complete change in the direction of the liue itself. It is now contemplated to make a line by Adrianople to Belgrade, and then branches to Salonica and to Cattaro, connecting thus all the provnces of European Turkey by means of the e'ectric wire. Another project is a line from Constantinople to Alexandria. The Turldsh Government will have to lay down the wire to the entrance of the Dardanelles; thence the Suez Indian Telegraph Company will do it. A great number of cases of frostbite have arrived from the Crimea, testifying to the cold prevailing there. AUSTRI.- (moM oUn owN con sroresEN.) - ,~MNA J". 1S. The articles on the concordat and aVainst the Italian bishops are already so numerous that only the more remarkable passages which they contain can be communicated.

The harbour of Genoa is now nearly as full as ever of deep sea going ships. Within -the last week seven vessels aniived from different parts of North or South America laden with cotton and colonial produce. The arrivals of grain during the past year have bean, however, comparatively smal, the diminution of 18m from 1854 having been 526,411 hectolitres; but the amount in deot at this moment is equal to the store on the 1st of January, 1855, notwithstanding. The consumptlion and exportation have absorbled about double the quantity importea, and this ias luckily been met by supplies from the interior, on which subject the protectionist Govermments of neighbouring States, where the exportation of grain has been prohibited for many months, would, no doubt, beableto afford the world some interesting information as to the success of their policy. Here, where trade is free, the question of food excitesa no anxiety, as it is felt that as soon as the stores begin to decline supplies will be brought in to meet the demand; and, indeed, already Egypt is beginning to send us corn from her granaries. Among the ships in harbour is conspicuous Her Majesty's steamer Himalaya, come here from Balaldava, to ship mules for the Eungish lIand Transport Corps and stores for the Sardinian-Government. She will takec about 400 mules -and muleteers, and is expected to sail towards the end cf next weak The Golden Fleece or Kangaroo, or both, are also expected shortly for simi-Jr service. The Malta Government has lately been giving contracts for oxen here, and yesterday a bark laden with 500 beasts was towed hence by a smaJl steamer bound for Valetta. Thess various demands cause great animation in the port, and, combined with the necesZsanr increaseZ and improvements in the town, give ample employmnent to the 'working popunlationZ. Neither the improvements nor increase proceed sufliciently rapidly, however, to meet the demands of increasing trade and inhabitants. Warehouses 'are wanted. Docks there arenone. The harbourrequi^res improving, and houserent is rising to exorbitant prices. To disinterested observers this state of t-hings lookxs very like an emai7rras de richesse, since the harbour and warehouses and the town itself were quite sufficient for the trade of the place in the good old days of the Republic, otherwise the enlightened patriots of those days would doubtless have enlarged them; but this is by no means the view taken by the Genoese themselve3 (that is, of the old original Genoese, for a great part of the present mercantile population is composed of inmmigrants), who hold that Genoa was intended by nature for the Genoese, and for them the accommodation is quite enough, and that if foreignl Governments or peoples choose to make use of their city as a communication with other parts of the world they must bear the expense of establishing suitable means. These ideas may seem extraordinary, and perhaps somewhat narrowminded, but it must be recollected that the black Republican of Genoa is a peculiar hybrid politician, not met with elsewhere, and whose patriotism is circumscribed within very narrow limits. To give every one his due, it must be admitted that the Genoese red Republican is more extended in his views, in that he would facilitate communication, if it 'wer not that he feelsbound to oppose the Piedmontese on principlc in everything it proposes, and more partcularly in anything likely to make it popuar with the people of the Ligurian Republic. As it is, however, both classes regard the constitational form of government with illiwill, and do their utmost to hinder its working for the good of the country, in which amiable object they have luckily been constantly thwarted by the good sense of those i power. The Corricre MercanjiZe of this place, which is a perfectly independent paper and much devoted to commercial interests, had an excellent article last night, combating the cry raised by the extreme parties on both sides for a dissolution, and apg$ealing to the judgment. of its readers to maintain a prudent courseand abstain from adding another to the many chanri`g that have been hurried on the scene since the establishment of the Constitution. This is not the season for travellers in Genoa. Those bound for Florence, Rome, or Naples have already passed southward, and will not return before Easter, and few strangers are tempted to pass a whole winter in the town of Genoa. The exQueen of the French still resides at Nervi, with the Duke and Duchess de Nemours and some other members of her family. She is completely restored to health,-so much so that she has expressed her intention of coming to Genoa for theHolyWeek, in order to vis,it the churches. N-ice is said to be very full of foreigners this 'winter, especialy English. The railway hence to 'Voltri, about eight English miles, on the Comiche road is to be opened next week, and arrangements are i progress for continuing the lne to Savona. TUIN, JAN. 15. Thediscussion onthe proposedloan of 30,000,000f., to meet the extraordinary expenses of the war budget, commenced yesterday, and, although not terminated, and hlkely to continue for one or two sittings more, the tendency of the debate to-day leaves little doubt of a result favourable to the Go w verument. It will be seen by the speeches on this occasion that His Majesty's Ministers are as much indebted to the wealk arguments of His Majesty's Opposition for their success as to any ability of their own. On the openingof the debate the Deputy Ghiglini reproved the Government for not having accepted the proposal of Count Revel to demand a larger loan from England at the time of making the Military Convention, as it was' aL-eady evident that the 50,000,OOOf. were not sufficient; but he would not renew the bitterness which the Minister of Finance must have felt from his false calculations. For the rest, it was the interest of the country and concerned its honour to maintain its engagements and provide for its soldiers, whose conduct had increased in' the Crimea the honoir of their arms. In nmine years of constitutional- life the expenses had always exceeded the in^ome; how far was this system of loans to be carried? In 1852 the Minister had promised to reduce the ordinary expenditure to 120, 0,000f., and now it was 138,000,000Sf. e knewI and esteemed the loyalty of the M1inister, but he abandoned himself to too many illusions. It was said that publc calamities had diminished the indirect taxes ;- but the cholera had augmentedthose on wins and inheritances, and the grape disease had caused an increased importation of foreign wnes, spirits, and sugar. When a loan was asked for it was alvays said to be the last.' The public debt,wlich in 1853 was already550,000,0oo£, would now oe raisedto 716,00,000f.,and atthe same time they. had-an expensive, war on their hands. If ti' peZroceeded much -furthers on?this roOd of delusiions and deficits the ruin of the finances 'would be m evtable. These were bitter words. -Ut ne -ished to open the eye3 of the public; The evil was not irremediable, and if the Mliniser wished to save the credit of the- Stte nd the fame of the . constitutional principle by . providing a better system 'of finance, he should be .happy to give him bis confidence. - Count Solaroodella Margaiita could nst'amr6ve a 5srstedange'rouifort'hefutuanditrppearcdtohim .eowardly to: gitc a, ill6nt Tote.

The journals bound-to the M1inistry strove and laboiued to - ceepi live in the people the Italian idea.

HIe.-recollected- the insi. thoughts of ',l848,; they wabnted a P6pe to pray and bless, and without power; but GOd would never p,ermit the execution of such a p,roject. . E della WMargarita then expressed mlf fa-. vourable to a federationi though be thought the difficulties immense. He lauded the.conduct.of those Sovereigns who, had concluded concord&ts with the Holy See, especially Frincis Joseph the Great. He did not expect as much from the present. Government of Sardinia ;but that would be accomplished by others. He should vote against the loan, not because he was 'opposed to the -lliance, but because he refused it to the Ministry. Depiuty Farini addressed himself, in the first instangs~ to the arguments of M1. Ghiglini, who, iMn repsving the Sardinian Miistry, had praised the ragacity of the statesmen of absolute monarchies; " but these," said thespeaker, " if they leave a few millions in the Treasury, leave also, many debts to civilization." Passing to the question of the alliance and convention,he congratulated the House upon the re,olution it had came to, and enlarged upon the justice of the cause in wbich they were embarked, and the evident gain to Piedmont from having adopted a decided line of policy while other countries wavered. He then described the miserable condition of some other States of the Peninsula, and concluded by saying that, if Ministers had an intition of the great good which might arise from the alliance, many duties stillremained forthem to fulfil for the welfare of the Italian people. Signor Costa della-Torre regretted that on the eve of the last elections sarcasms, derision, and contumely had been cast in the faceof the representatives of the nation. He then spoke of the taxes, of the continued emigration, of rural crime, of the magistracy, and then again of the representatives, who had been designated as "puppets and boots." (The President reminded the speaker that he was responsible for the expressions he made use of, even though only repeating what had been said elsewhere.) The nation would not refuse sacrifices for its army in the East, but it would not give a loan to Ministers who passed themselves off as the sole support of the Statuto, and who, straggling with the clergy, left the religious orders to die of hunger S" Oh, oh I"), and, without caring for the public safety, plunged into a ruinous war. This orator then got still deeper into the ecclesiastical question, and persevered in giving the House his speech (which was a written one), notwithstanding the efforts of the President to recall hiin to the subject under discussion. Deputy Farina thought the moment favourable for making peace ; but, if the war was likely only to benefit Austria, he did not see why Sardinia should spend blood and treasure in supporting it. He should vote for the loan, but urged the Government to make it abroad, so as not to take capital from industrial undertalings. Deputy Ponziglione was opposed to the loan for general and special reasons. If the loan should be contracted, as appeared ikely, with England, it would have the effect of placing the future of this country in her hands, and the railways were already mortgaged to her and a debt contracted for 50,000,000f. He would not vote for the loan, not because he did not share all the pains of the soldiers, but because the army is aprism, behind which the Ministry conceals its policy. On the Chamber meeting to-day, Deputy Buffa comnienced by reproaching the church party with always introducing religion into discussions purely political. "I also am Catholic," he said, " but I r.ise my voice against you. Among those reprobates who you say are leading the country to irreligion there are many who wouid make al sacrifices for religion short of rendering it ridiculous." Afterwards, speaking of the alliance, he showed how much the importance of Piedmont had been increased by it. It had been hailed with sympathy by the whole country. Rich and poor, all had given evidence of their esteem for the army, and from every State in Italy subscriptions had been received for the Crimean fund. WVhen the wounded soldiers returned from the Crimea there 'were fetes in allthe towns where they passed. "You ask 'where we lead you to," he said, in conclusion; "we conduct you to see your flag floating along with those of the two greatest nations of Europe; to see your Riing traverse in triumph the most civiliekd part oF Europe; we lead you to see the continuation of the glorious traditions of your monarchy." Deputies Revel and Della Motta said they should vote for so much of the loan as wms necessary for the war (24,000,000f.), but that they would not vote for the other 6,000,0eof., which the Ministry demanded for the deficit of the budget. BE. de Revel reproached the Ministry for not having last year accepted his preposition of endeavouring to obtain alargerloanfrom England than 50,000,000f., which had not sufficed forthe exigencies of the war. The anticipations of the Ministry had been mistaken oe this subject, and now the loan would cost much learer. There were, moreover, always more than 15,000 men in the Crimea, and that was another reason why the 50,0002000f. bad not been sufficient. Count Cavolur, Minilster of Finance, accepted, on the part of the MIinistry, theproposaI of the deputies Revel and Della MIotta. " Let them vote," he said, " the 24,000.000f., on which subject I think therewill be unanimity, and afterwardsvoteonthe 6,0O0,000f. that the rMinistrydemands forthe wants of the Interior. The Ministry, utder the circumstances, cannot doubt of having the confidence of the majority or the Chamber." He then proceeded to show that, but for the deficient harvest and the consequent dearness of provisions, the budget would now have exhibited an equilibrium, as Te had promised in 1852. The duty on grain had been taken off, which formerly brought in 3,000,O00f. The octroi duties had been reduced by 1,500,OO0f. The maintenance of the ordinary army had cost, in consequence of the dearness of provisions, 2,000,000f. more than- usual; the freight of coal 500,eOOf. extra under the extraordinary circumstances; and it was necessary to raise the interest on Treasury Bills from 4 to 6 per cent. For the rest, the wealth of the country was evident. No country had made the transition from protection to free trade with fewer shocks. The tariff on almost all foreign goods had been lowered 45 or 50 per cent.; on iron 80 per cent. ; and the industry in iron itself, as in all other things, had been stUmulated, and produced more and more, and at cheaper rates. Tobacco, which, in 1852, gave 12,000,OOOf., in 1855 produced 16,O000,00f. The land tax only realized 16,000,00f. " It cannot be said either," he concluded, "that a country is hi dis tress which in si years has constructed a networlk of railways of 700 kilometres-equal to what Belgium has been 22 years constructing. - -Ja. 16. To-day the Chamber of Deputies has voted the loan of 30,000,000 demanded by Government by a large majority, there being 108 in favour and 29 against it in a house of 137. The discussion was not so animated as on the previous days, andthe mem- bers of the Left were divided in their counsels, L. 2¶ellana and others who voted for the financial convention annexed to the treaty of alliance voting with the Mfinistry-that is to say, for the ihole 30,000,000. - Mi de Revel had proposed yesterday a division of the loan intotwo separatevotes, saying that he wonld vote for the 24,000,000 for the army with all his heart, but that he could not vote for the 6,000,000 demanded for the wants of the interior; and, as 3f. de Cavour had said that he was ready to accept such division, sifice there was a- unanimous demonstration of sympathy towards the army, anid that on the 6,000,000 a vote of political con- fidence in the M1inistry: might be taken, M. deR.evel wished to correct this view, and protested that he had no desire to make it a Miniterifal ,uestion. He only wished to consider it as an admmistiative: question, because the deficit of 6,000,000 at the end of 1856 w as not certain; because the Ministers could meet the wants of the current ex-'! rnc tla It urr-biLU; baume iu fn#heX

WEST COAST OF "RICA; - - PLYMOUTH, JA. 20. The African Steam Navigation Company's mail packet Ethiope, Commuander Barnwell, arrived this morning. Her dates are, outward, Madeira,. Novembe 1;- Teneriffe, 3; Goree, 9; Bathurst, 10; Sierra Leone, 14; Liberi 18; Cape Coast, 22; Accra, 24; Lagos, 25; Fernando Po, 29; Camaroons, December 2; and Old Calabar, 5. Homeward-Bonny, December 7; Iagos, n; Accra, 14; Cape Coast, 15; Liberia, 20; Sierra Leone, 25; Bathurst, 29; Goree, 30; and Madeira, January1l. Her cargo consists of palm oil, bees wax,- arrowroot, ivory, &c., and she has about 4,ooOos. of golddust. Among the passengers are, from Legos, Lieutenant the Hon. 3. LJscelles, on promotion, and Lieutenant H. T. Boger, invalided; from Bathurst, Commissary J. M. Lindsey; from Goree, Captain Costd and Paymaster J. H. Harry, of Her *Majesty's-ship Myrmidou. Trade is improving at Millicourie, where there is a great -influx of hides and ivory, but the high price of tobacco has restricted the exchange. The differences rwith the chiefs in the Sherbro have been settled, and the Governor of Sierra Leone has issued a notice to that effect, dated December 12. The trade at the Cameroons is entirely stopped, in consequence of a dispute between the natives in the interior. The screw steam gun-vessd Teazer, 3, Commander Walter [Grubbe, which returned to Sierra Leone on the 12th of December from a cruise between Cape Mount and the Sherbro, reports that a serious disturbance had occurred at Sinow, arising from a canoe having been taken from the British bark Ariel by one of the people there, and the supercargo, Mr. Harziett, applying to the authorities for its [restoration, the sheriff sent to demand it, when one of the -native huts was set on fire, and in the affray which took place one of the sheriff's men was killed. Several of the surrounding towns were destroyed, and one with up. wards of 100 houses entirely burnt, with the exception of a miission-hbouse. President Roberts,with the British Consul, mr. Newnham, left Monrovia on the 26th ult., and arrived at Sinow on the 27th, when they went on shore and found that several of the Liberia people had been murdered. The President and' Consul returned the following day to Monrovia, with several - European ladies, in the Teazer; and a voluntary corps was being raised to be despatched immediately to Sinow by the American schooner George. An attack was also expected at Cape Mlount. The Jamestown, American frigate, 26 guns, Commodore 1 Crabb, arrived at Monrovia on the 26th Ilt. - An American schooner, the Alexander Mitchell, is said7to have lately shipped and carried off upwards of 300 slaves between Cape Palmas and the Bights, after leaving 3fonrovia, where she had caUed in with a cargo of American produce. The paddlewheel steam-vessel Myrmidon, 3, Commander Edward E. Maunsell, from Sierra Leone, arrived at the Rio Pongas early in December, with the Rev. Mr. Leacock, Commander Buck, and other officers, Captain Fletcher, 3d West India Regiment, &c., and, having anchored outside the bar, sent the deputation in boats up to Tintania, where they were received by Kennebac Al, the Chief. The next day they were introduced to King Catty, and a number of Mandingo chiefs. After a palaver it was agreed that Mr. Leacock should reside among them, the King pro. inising to send his children to be educated, and Kennebac Ali having given his residence until a suitable house wa built for the missionary. The prices of American produce in bond in Sierra Leone were quoted on the 15th of December-tobacco, 9d. to 10d. per lb.; flour, $14 per barrel; rum, 3s. per gallon; lumber, $30 per 1,000; pilot bread, $7 per barrel; shingles, $6 per -1,000; beef, per barrel, mess, $0; pork, per barrel, $30; shingling nails, 6d.per lb. From the Gambia our inteUigence is satisfactory. Her Majesty's ship Penelope, 16, Sir William Wiseman, Bart., arrived at Bathurst on the Ist of December, and left for Sierra Leonc, Ascension, and the Cape of God Hope on the 11th. Major Harry St. George Ord, of the Royal Engineers, Commissioner to the Cold Coast, went out in the Penelope, the bearer of despatches from Lord Panmure, ordered bythe Home Government on special service, to advise with the, Governor of the Gambia respecting the mlitary defence of that colony. Major Ord accompanied Governor O'Connor on a minute inspection of the several military posts-Fort Bullen, Bathurst, and Cape St. Mary's-and went through the Baccow Pass, where 200 men, under command of Governor O'Connor, fought successfully for two hours a very superior force of the 3Mahomedan rebels, under the Black Prophet, Hadagee Ismael, on the 17th of July; to where Sabbagee onee stood-for not a trace of a habitation now remains ; to Baccow Xonko, the field of the action between the combined British and French forces, commanded by Governor O'Connor, and the Mahonmedan rebels, under the Black Prophet, on the 4th of Augost. The Governor and Major Ord inspected the whole of the boundary line of the ceded territory, and Major Ord having handed in his report on the 11th, they finaly decided on works necessary for the defence of HerMajesty's settlements in the Gambia. Governor O'Connor held a full and important palaver with Demba Sunka, King of Barra, on the 7th of December. Sir Willm Wiseman, his officers, the brass band, and 100 picked Marines and sailors formed the guard of honour. The King of Barra, his Alcadis and chiefs, attended with 80 Surrawoolie cavalry, under their leader, Ansunmama Taji, and 1,600 infantry, the largest force ever present at any palaver in Western Africa. His Majesty was greatly pleased with the appearance of the sailors and marines, but the brass band engrossed his principal attention. He expressed to "his friend" the Governor " how much he felt gratified by the great respect paid to him, and tnat all his troops and the ' Surruwoolies were ready to march against any enemy of his Excellency.Y The palaver lasted several hours, terminating without an accident. and in the most satisfactory manner. Governor O'Connor's medical attendants have decided that he must return to Europe in the spring, as his health has become so much impairedfrom long tropical service. The Emperor Napoleon has created Commander Ducrest de Villenenve an officer, and Lieutenants Le Romeau, Fillan, and Morell chevaliers of the " Imperial Order of tha Legion of Honour" for distinguished service in the field, and at the storming and capture of Sabbagee on the 4th of August. The wounded soldiers,-seven, received medals. Her Majestys paddlewheel steamship Scourge, 6, Commodore John Adams, sailed from Fernando Po on the M3th of November, for the Windward Coast, and arrived at Cape Coast on the 16th of December; the brig Philomel, 8, Commander Skeene, arrived at Lagos on the 9th of December. There were at Sierra Leone, December 22, the paddlewheel steam-fiigate Penelope, .16, Captain Sir W. S. Wiseman, Bart.; the sloop Ferret, 8, Commander Charles T.

She had been in company with the English ship Garland, at Palmas, on the 7th, and left her at anchor off Cavalla onthe 8th. The French brig-of-war Victor, 18, from Goree and Nunez, ran on the middle ground at Sierra Leone on the 12th of December. After throwing six of her guns overboard, and stsating a quantity of water, she was got offsafely by Her Mfajesys steamer Teazer and the boats from the brig Ferret, and entered the port on the 15th under a salute of 21 guns from Tower-hilL.

ZW REPORT. -. C- .COtRT OF CHANCERY. 3Awn-. At. 1 LEE V. GREBN. - ' (Before the LaoBDCnAwcELoR.I This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Stuart. The plaintiffs obtained, a decree 6f this Court: arainst aperson named Hohnes, and on the lOti-of August, alff5, registered the same, in order to manke it a charge nupo his real estate under the statute.

VICE-CEUNCELLORS' C01URTS. `MA. 19. .DAWSON V. KEArTO. - i (Before ViCc-ChanCd&rS&r J. STUART.3 The VICE-CnAcELLon this morning gave judgment in, this case, which was argued before him on the last day do the sittings before the Christmas vacation. The facts are fully stated in the judgment. MIr. Taylor, Mr. Welford, and M1r. Raymond, of the common law bar, were counsel in the case; - The VICE-CfNC iLO.--The plaintiff, whois s legatee, and one of the residuary legatees, has moved to vary the chief clerk's-certificate, by which he has statedc that. Janm. 'Velch is a creditor of the testator for 100L. on a promissory note. The objection is that the note was made without any consideration. The evidence of want of. consideration. Is only given on infornation and belief, and is rmere hearsay from the defendant's solicitor. According to this evidence,such as it is, it appears that the note in q-estin (which is datea in 1850) is the renewalof a note for the 'samie sum gven ai-.t 12 years ago by the testator to the sime John Velhas a gift to the infant child of a friend; that about six or seven yearg ago Welch applied to the, testator for six years' interest upon the note, which the testator paid, and on that occasion the original note was'cancelled and the present note was given in lien of it, and that since the death of the testator who died in 'May, 1853) the defendant, his executor, had paid six years! interest on the note. Assuming that there was no valuable consideration for the original note, and that it was a mere gift, the effect of the cancellation of the original note and the renewal seems, upon the authorities, materialy to remove'the objection of want of consideration. Giving up securities whoUy void for usury has been held a sufficient consideration for a second contract to repay the money; ard if the principle on which this is held be, as has been said, the uncertainty whether the usury might be proved or pleaded in an action to enforce the securities, that might apply to the case of a promissory note, on the uncertainty whether in an action to recover the amount it would ho necessary to prove the consideration. It was said by the Chief Juticoe 3lansfleld,`inOth'cse of " Lee v. Muggendge'" (5 Taunt., 45) that it has long been established that where a persou is bound morally and conscientiously to pay a debt, though' niot legaUy bound, a subsequent promise to pay will give a right of action. In the present case, besides the renewal of the note, there is the fact of the payment of interest by the testator, and continued by his executor. The execator. might have confessed judgment if an action had been brought against him. The payments in respect of interest by the executor could not weU be disaUlowed in passing' his accounts. If allowed, the allowance could only be as payments in respect of an obligation by the testator, and as an acknowledgment of the debt and the price of forbearance from enforcing it. These circumstances prevent me 'from bein,g satisfied thatit was wrongtocertify that this note was a debt against the testator's estate. Another view of the case arises from the course of the Court in the administration of assets as to voluntary bonds. It is on behalf of a legatee, and not of a creditor, that the objection to thisnote is made. In the case of a bond want of consideration. isnoobjectionatlaw. Yet this Court, in an administrtion suit, reats a voluntary bond not according to its legal force as a specialty debt, nor even as equal to a simple contract debt for valuable consideration, but a5s'payable in priority of any legacy. If a voluntary obligation in the nature of a debt is treated as payable in preference to legatees, who are also mere volunteers without anything of the nature of an obligation or debt binding thetestator himself, the principle would seem to apply as much to a promissory note, by which the testator had voluntrily bound himself, as to the voluntary obligation by bond. The volunteer claiming under an istrument by which the teatator binds himself as a debtor may reasonablybe paid, before the volunteer claiming merely by testamentary gift. The state of the assets here will, according to the certiicate, only make the creditor on the note payable in preference to legatees, and not in preference to any other creditor The motion to vary the certificate must terefora be refused (Before Vice-Chancedior Sir W. P. WooD.) His Hoxoun disposed of his list of petitions and short causes, after which the part-heard cause of:"EUerton v. Darby" again occnpied the remainder.of the day.
COURT OF QUEEIS BENCH. WEST-STFP- .TJA 19 BUSIESS OF THE COURT. (Sittings in Banco, before Lord CrAPBiLL and Juzices COLERIDGE, WIGHTiAN, and CRo.mPtOa.) Lord CmIPBELL said that in all cases in the special paper and Crown paper, if an application be made to the Court upon a day previous to the day on which the cases ought to be argued, and sufficient ground for the postponemnent be laid before the Court, they will be postponed accordingly; but otherwise the cases in those papers will be taken in their order. If side only is present the Court will hear that side; and if neither side is present the case will be struck out. The greatest inconvenience has arisen from applications being made for the postponement of cases during the day on which they ought to be argued. That is inconvenient to the Court as well as to the counsel vho are to argue them. The Court will be most happy to accommodate the gentlemen of the bar, and-if dn a prior day an application be made for the postponement of any case the Court will be ready to hlsten to it; but, unless such application be made, the Court will in future nia formly and rigidly take the cases in their order. DESTON V. THE GREAT NORTHERN RAMLWAY COMPANY. This was a special case stated for the opinioii of this Court on the suggestion of the judge of the Clerkenwell County Court. The plaintiff sued the Great Northern Railway Company to recover the sum of 51. lOs., either as damages for the breach of a contract into which the defendants, as he alleged, had entered with him to carry him direct from Peterborough to Hull at a given hour, or for a false representation that they were ready so to carry him. It appeared that certaiun time tables for the month of March last had beeu prepared and exhibited to public view in certain places by the authority of the defendants' company. The tables stated that a train left Peterborough at a certain hour, and went on to Hul the same night, leaving the Mlford Junction at 7 2. The plainti having seen the time-biffs, and having business at Peterborough, made his arrangements to despatch his business at Peterborough during the day, and to go on to lull the same night by the train as advertised. He applied accordingly at the hour appointed at the station at Peterborough for a ticket to Hull, but he was informed that he could not go beyond the Milford Junction station that night, as the train which formerly ran at that hour from the Milford Junction stition to Hull on a line belonging to another company had been discontinued It appeared that the time-bills had been prepared and printed at the end of February, and contained a true statement of the trains as they were running at that timebut that on the 27th of February the defendants received notice from the company to which the branch line belonged that the train in guestion would be discoptinued. Nevertheless, the company Issued the bills without making the necessary correction, and continued to publish them down to the 20th of March, the day when thepntiff appliedfora ticket to be carried on to Hull direct. The com y did not grant a ticket as requested, but they gave the plaihtiff. one to the Milford Julncton. The plaintiff went on to the Milford Junction, and was there detained for several hours,. and subsequently sued the defendants for the damage which he had so sustained by reason of the defendants' breach of contract or false representation. The question raised for the decision of the Court was whether the action could be sustained, either on the gronnd that the defendants had been guilty of a breach of contract or of a faLse represantation. Br. MIaynard argued the case for the plaintiff; and Mr. Hugh Hill for the defendants. In the course of the argument, - -E Mr. Justice WIGroanr1 suggested that the continued publication of the time-bills amotmnted to a promise that if any person would appear at the time appointed and pay his fare the company would carry him on to Hull direct. Lord CNnIaBELL said this case is of very great importance both to railway companies and to the public. It seems to me that railways would not be that benefit and accommodation to the publc which they have been, if the representations made in their tim'e-tables are4to be treated as so miuch waste paper, and not as the foundation for a contract I 'am of opinion that the plaintiffis entitledtorecover, both on the ground that there was a contract and also a false representation. It seems to metobejust the same as if the company should publish a contract in express terms that, in consideration that their customers would come to a particular station, at a particular hour, a train would 'e passing at that hour, or near that hour, and any persoh 'who paid his fare should have a ticket from that station to any other statibn. Does not the time-table amount to suchacontract as that? 'Any one who reads it understands that at the particular time there will be a train from Peterborough to Hull, arid that any person who comes will be accomm'odated 'with a scat on paying his fare. A prejudice musttresult to any-person who came, having made his arrangements with a view to it, aid tenderedhis fare. The promise iY indicated hywhat is found in the time-table. An example of the same ptinciple is-found in the case where a reward is offered't& anyperson who will give such information as shall lead t&thiczonvic- tion of an offender. That is a promis made to the: public generally, and is the same as if the parties were pr t. it is a c6n&itionral 'promise,' Sand when thesconditid'n hs been Perforned it do. comes. absolute.

- IMSOLVENT DEBTORS COUBT, Jan. 19. 1Rr 3EWTLTA'rT lVIlDE. I (Before Mr. Gomm*MIoncr Pnjars.] In this case a rule niii had been granted upon the appEcation of a creditor, calling upon the asgnees to show cause wby they should not pay into court the sum of 190. -which had been lost to the estate by their mismanagement. The insolvent was discharged at Manchester in January 1855, but in his schedule he made no mention of a policy of assurance for 2000. -which he had effected in February, 1iS3, upon the life of his wife. The policywas then in the hands of a creditor, who held it as security for a debt of 77., but during the insolvent's imprisonment a person named George Bowes Barnett Paid the 7L, and obtained possession of the policy-a transfer of which the insolvent promised to give, but dia not. In Febraary, 1855, the wife died, and in May Messrs. Whittom and Bland were appointed assigneee, and soon afterwards they sold to Barrett their interest in the- olicy, the existence of which he had disclosed to them, for 10. Baxnett immediately applied to the asmsrance office and obtained payment of the 200L The affidavts on behlf of the assignees went to show that Barnett concealed from them the fMct that the wife was dead at the very time they sold him their interest in the policy, and that it was at Barnett's suggetion that there were book debts to collect that they became assignees. There was, however, a statement in ton affidavit of the assigness that Barnett had before their appointment told them that the assurance office would not pay him without the assent of theassignees of theinsolvent, Mr. DowsE showed cause against the rule, and argued that the assigness had been misled by Barnett as to the value of the polcy, and that their sale to him of their interest was under the belief that it ias a policy recently effected, and that 10!. was its fullvalue. e also contended that, although the assignees were accountable. for misappropriating or wasting moneys actually received, yet in a case of this nature, where they had not received the - money sought to be recovered, the Court had no power tomake any order upon them. - Mr. SA.GOOD, in support of the role, contended -that there had, in the words of the act of 3arliament, been. "waste and mnismanagement ;" and therefore the assigneeswere accountable for the consequences of their own mngeect. Ifthey had been deceived by Barnett, as they allegedi they could take proceedings against that person, but thenemedy: of the creditors was against them. Mr. Commissioner kmufnres held it to be the duty of persons who took upon themselves the office of assignees toexercise dlue diligence and caution in realizing 'he assets and if bytheir misconduct or mimanagement any lees ws- sustained, or anyinjury accrued to the estate, they w-ere liable to make good the cdeficiency. -In this case thesimplest and most obvious course for te assignees to haveadopted, when first informed of the edistence of the policy, *ould have been to go to the assuranceoffice, and then 'theywouldhavelearntthatthepolicywaspayable,andudL >u. asset for the general body of theinsolventoreditors. -Barnett certainly appeared to have acted like .a consummate hypocrite, but-it was singular that the assignees- admitted they kimew before their appointment that the- insuranceofficewoald not pay Barmett the- amnount of the policy withont - the consent of some official representative of thif- creditors. He could not avbid coming to the conclusion that the rule must be made absolute upon the aasigaees for the payment of 190!.-the difference between 10o. received and the 20. payable on the policy. As, however, ho was disincEned toimpute fraud or collusion te the asignees, he -would not fx: them with costs, but would allow the cieditor -who -lied ob-; tained the ralehis c06ts out of the estate;. * - - : ;Rule absolute.i - - *- -A aIdvertisement.-eThor"Pas man' nockw.' -ord% by -`Ar.tthornton-;Ukie T.W h teo u.-Liosadon: >ist and- Cc -Awettacg, lidytbhe or.

CEIIE iN SOMERSEn SE.-In consequenlce of the large and increasing extent of undetected crime the magistrates of the county of Somerset have in contemplation the establishment of an efficient county police. Many magistrates who were formerly opposed to such a proposition have now acceded to its necessity, and it is nnderstood that, at the next sessions for the county, the 2d and 3d of Victoria, chap. 83, will be introduced. 3Mr. W. IL Langton, ALP., Sir P. Acland, and others, formerly opposed to, now support the measure, which has the concurrence of the Hon. W. G. Hayter. In conseonence of the growing evil several parishes have petitioned for the introduction of the rural fpolice, the parish constabulary being totally inadequate to the suppression of the organized gangs which are so systematic in their crime.

The Plan proposed by Mlr. Christian, and approved by Mr. PurdVy, his assistant was of a highly ornamental character, based upon his intimate knowledge of ancient cathedral decorations as well as of the principle adopted upon the continent in the mostcelebratedceclesasteal edjices. Mr. Harcoart, whose taste and research in such matters are well known, approved generaly of Mr. Christian's proposition. On the otner hand, the bshopwas infavourof a more subdued tone of decoration, in which he was sapprted by several members of the chapter. Specimens of both styles have long been in existence on portions of the roof, for the pnrPose of judging of the effect of each; but of such a partial description that it was impossible to come to anv satisfacwith conclusion as to the general effect. Months elapsed out either party being able to see any just cause or reason why they should modify their origina opinion, and at length it was determined that Mr. Owen Jones shouldbe called intodecidethe knottypoint. According y that gentleman visited Carle, exammied the respective speennens, and has just sent in his recommendations, which have boen adopted, and are to be carried out forthwith. The panels ars to have a groundwork of bright azure, powdered with goldl stars (that is the technical phrase) ; the ribs and bosses are to be painted various colours, red, blue, k-c., and the coats of arms and other armorial bearings are to be restored after the most accurate heraldic designs ; the angels which surround the cornice are to be "ilded and coloured, and the large angels on the hammerheams are to be treated in a similar manner.

THE ALLE67ED POISONIN.GSAT.RUGELEY. Ihis morning, between 10 andfl @ocock, Wiiiam Palmer, now awaiting his trial on the verdict of two coroner's inquests, for the murder of AnnePalmer, his wife, andJohn Parsons Cook, will be brouglht before the Court of Queelns Bench, at Westminster-hall, under a writ of habcacs corpus, in the character of a witness, on the trial of a civil action before Mr. Justice ErIe and a jury, which is fixed to commence at 1I o'clock to-day. The prisoner was brought up to town from Stafford yesterday morning in the custody of Major Pulford, the governor of the prison there, and two officers, and lodged in the House of Detention at Clerkenwell for safety over night. The party travelled by a train which left Stafford at half-pas, 6 in the morning, and arrived at Euston-square terminus at 11 o'lockL - ]ut a smallU number of persons were present at the station at Stafford at that early hour in the moming, when they took their departur& Besides, a general impression prevailed there that he would have left at a later period in the day, so as to arrive in London late at night orearly in the morning. On the journey-upi to town intelligence had been conveyed along the line that the accused was a passenger by the train, and at several of the principal stations a few people had colleted to catch a glimpse of him as he passed, which he seemed anxious rather to court than to avoid. On arriving at Euston-square, where hewas not expected, there was no crowdor excitemeint, and on alighting from the carriage he was immediately con-eyed in a cab to the Clerkemwell House of Dqtention. The habcs co*p2us under which he has been removed from Stafford was granted by Mr. Justice Erle, on an application made to him on 3Monday last, and its object is understood to be to enable the prisoner, lWilliam Palmer, to appear as a witness and give evidence on the trial of an action brought by a person named Padwick against Mrs.- Palmer, his mother, upon a bill of exchange for 1,0001. The bill isalleged to be a forgery, and Palmer's presence is required to establislh the plea of forgery, which it is understood he will do. At the suggestion of Ur. Justice Efle, the police authorities at the Kiing-street station, Westminster, received instructions a day or two ago to make the necessary arrangements for guarding the avenues to the court-and maintaining the public peace during the entrance and exit of the prisoner, in the event of any crowd assembling on the occasion, and an adequate police force wil be in attendance to discharge that duty. It is said the trial wil take place in the Lord Chancellor's court, and that the prisoner wil enter by the judges' private entrance, and remain in a private room until he is called to give evidence. On the conclusion of the trial he wi be immediately conveyed to the station at Euston-square, to return to Stafford by the first available train. During the last few days Captain Hatton, the chief of the constabulary of the county of Stafford, on whom the duty has principally devolved of procuring evidence touching the mysterious transactions affecting the prisoner, has been again in London with that view, and has had an interview with Sir George Grey, the Secretary of State forthe Home Department, on the subject, and been otherwise actively engaged in that mission. On his return to Stafford on Tuesday night last he expressed his gratification that the inquest on the body of Walter Palmer had been adjourned, as he had obtained evidence calculated to throw additional light on the circumstances under investigation. The nature of that evidence, for obvious reasons, it would not at present be desirable to state; and it is the less necessary as it will be legitimately disclosed before the proper tribunal in a day or two.
THE INCOMB-TAX AND THE WAR. On Friday evening a numerous meeting of the inhabitants of Birmingham was held in the Town-hali, for the purpose of taking into consideration the present unjust operation of the tax upon income, with a view to its more equitable adjustment and imposition. In the absence of the Mayor, who was prevented by other engagements from attending, Mr. Arthur Byland was called to the chair. Among those present were Mr. Muntz, MP., Mr. Scholefield, MP., Mr. T. A. Attwood, Mr. T. C. Salt, 31r. George Downing, Mr. Brooke Smith, Mr. C. Sturge, and other influential inhabitants of the borough. Mr. Minrs, MLP., in moving the first resolution, alluded at some length to the part which he had taken in Parliament in reference to the tax, during the last 13 or 14 years. lhen'Sir Robert Peel introduced it, in 1842, there was a great outcry against it by those who opposed him on political grounds; but he (Mr. Muntz) voted for it on the distinct understanding, on the pledge made in the most solemn manner, that it was only to continue three years; and knowing at the time that it was impossible to add any tax upon any article of general consumption which would not injuriously affect the bulk of the people. He explained at the time how well he recollected the old property-tax at the end of the French war; and how impos sible it was for any man to protect himself from being deo frauded by the Government servants. The party on his side of the House abused him for giving the vote to which he referred, and he naturally supposed that at the end of three years these gentlemenwouldvote againsta renewalofthetax. To his astonishment, however, thosewho abusedhimactually turned aound andvoted for it themselves. (Laughlter.) Since then he had invariably voted against the tax. He (Mr. Muntz) had had good opportunities of judging of the working of the impost. Many of his constituents, especially those who mmigt be said to belong to the working classes, had called upon him, produced their books, and shown him that they had had repeatedly to pay for what they never earned. They had been charged with the tax, and they had no remedy or redress except by exposing their books. and the secrets of their business, not only to men in the samne trade asthemselves, but, perchance, to their bank-ers or creditors, who would, perhaps, put an end to them altogether when they saw the situation in which their affairs were placed. He had known an instance where a man was surcharged three times because he would not show his books. Now, robbing a man by an unjust and iniquitous law was ten times worse than robbing him by personal violence. By the present system a man with a certain amount of oroperty was taxed upon it the same as the man with a casual income derived from his profession or his trade, whether he got it or not. That was clearly a fraudulenit plan, and any Governrnent-Vhig, Tory, or Radical-that supported such a law, merely because it was an easy mode of extracting a large amount-partly justly and partly unjustly-from the pockets of the people, did not deserve the confidence of the people. He knew it would be said, "Oh, these people want to oppose the Government-they want to get ridof the war." Now, hethoughtthat everyone in Birmingham oughttoknowv that he coudd not be chargeable with such an intention. (Hear.) He had supported the war because he believed it to be a war of ustice, a war of necessity, a war upon which the independence and existence of this country depended. (Cheers.) No one would be better pleased than he should to see an honourable, a finn, and a lasting peace secured to the world, provided the dintyof England was preserved in securing it. (Hear.) Give him a peace of this kind, and he would accept it; but he would never submit to one which would only give a little breathing time to our enemies, and oblige us ere long to begin everything de noro. (Great cheering.) The longer the war lasted the more impossible would it be to repeal the income-tax. It might even have to be increased; but if it was to be increased, that was the rat reason why it should be made more just. (Hear.) He beheved, however, thattherewasno intention todoso,though he would be bound that a few men meeting together for a few honurscould make a just and equitable tax upon property. His presence there that night had nothin- to do with the war, but he attended merely because he believed that a great number of his townsmen and countrymen were placed by this objectionable, unLsound, and iniquitous law in such a situation that they must rob themselves, to an extent unknown, while others were allowed to escape. The resolution he had to propose was,- "That in the opinion of this meeting the present system of levying a tax on industrial incomes is unjust, that an equitable adjustment is essentialy necessary, and that the iniquitous powersunder which the tax is now assessed ought to hi abolishe'd." (Cheers.) Mr. SCEsOarraxan, MY., in seconding the motion, said, there could be no doutbtthat when the tax was first imposed it was understood to be only atemporary one, and that althoulghthe people grumbled a little they offered no serions opposition. CircTumstances were nowv, however, witdely different. Whether they were to have such a peace as they all desired-an honourable and a lastMng peace -such as perhaps the circumstances which they hadiread wsithin the last 24 hours would lead them to hope for; or whethertheywere to have a further contnuance of that just and righteous war in which they were now engaged (cheers), in which case they must be prepared to go to a vast expenditure of blood and treasure-in either of these cases, they might depend upon it, the income aind propertytax would remain or many years, even if it were not retained as a permanent engine of taxation. (lear, hear.) Many believed that a direct tax of that character, made just in all its bearings, would enable Government to take off many indirect taxes that were now extremely onerous uxon the people. (Hear, hear.) He had ever been a frien of direct taxation. Now, with regard to the first part of the resolution there could not be two opinions. Here was a man with an income of 500!., derived from investment in the funds, to himself and family for ever; and, on the other side, a man with 5001., derived from the exercise of his ou n industry-an income which might fail to-morrow in consequence of illness, or which might totally fail in consequenco of death; andyet they wouldfind menwho were prepared to tel them that these two persons were in precisely simila circumstance5-that one man was no richer than the other thata manwith50.0a-yearwhichmightcaseto-morrow and aamanwith 500'. a-year whichmight be his own, his children's, or his posterizNa forever were equally rich and equaly subject to taxation under the act. It seemed almost impossible fer any man to entertain such an opinion. Some years ago a sect of philosophers existed in this coumtry who believed thatthere was no such thing as solid natter,- biut that everything was ideal. Dr. Johnson refused to argue with thee people, but, seeing a stove before bin, one day he kieked it an susch might that his foot tingled with pan. And this experiment was the leaned Doctofg answer, and the best answer that could be given. The Income-tax Association, by whom that meeting had been calod,, insisted upon capitalization of income, as beingth&bestmag of arriving at a just decision on the subject. AU -Wt ttt_y svmted to arrive at was, that they should draw a fair and reasonable disnction between the two classes of income. If the Government would say, " We acknowledge and will do the best to remedy it,' he (Mr. Scholefield) wQuld not caU for a measure completely and accurately jt towards every cass and individual of this country, for thishe beheved was impossible with the divers interests at present existing. As it regarded the inguisitorial powers of the act, it was well known thatparties who made fair andhoneststatements were frequently surcharged. That was robbery. They might qualify the act of the assessor in any way they pleased, but he (Mr. Scholefield) could only come to the conclusion that if a man was surcharged he was robbed, or he was compelled to make a return he never earned, and thus robbed. himscl£f It meant this- " You must bring your books, and you must expose the Whole of your trading transactions to the individuals who themselves have committedthe wrong upon you] M lemust paybrappea, andthey knew what-thatappealmeant. The ncome-tax Reforn Association proposed as a remedy that npon appeal a statement -of income, supported by oath or declaration of the taxpayer, shotddbe finl. There might possibly be frauds, but the question was not how to treat the fmudulent but the great mass of the community, who were, he beleied, beyond the reach of such an example. The siggestion that a witness should cdafirm-the statement of the appellant was worthy of consideration. In conclusion, Mr. Scholefield said, it had been urged upon him by the -association that Mr. Mbuntz and himself should divide the HIouse upon the question. He could not pledge himself to a course of that description, for discussions in the House took such turns, and became so changed in their ultimate ends, that to divide would perhaps be very improper for it was very possible that it might be used as a party manceuvre, and he couldnot pledge himself. He never had and never would start a subject merely for the purpose of discussion and nothing more. His object was to arrive at a decision. (Loud cheers.) The resolution was supported by Mr. G. TuRinE and others and carried unanimously. - Mr. T A. AmrooD moved the adoption of a memorial t,o the Chancellor of the Exchequer embodying at great length the objections to the income-tax as at present levied, and being seconded by Mr. F. WxnrS, it was carried unanimously, as was also a petition to the same effect to the House of Commons. A vote of thanks being passed to the chairman, the meeting separated. The following is the petition referred to! - " To THE RIGmt Ho. SIu G. COR.AsLL ISMULrw, nART., 24P., CiLwcELLon OF THE ExcHEQuER. "Therespectful memorialof the inhabitantsof theborough of Birmingham, in public meeting assembled, showeth . "That your memorialists, in common as they beheve with Her Majesty's Government, the Houses of Parliament, and the people, are convinced that the present income and property tax laws are inequitable, unjust, and inquisitoriaL " That your memonalists consider it to be a truism, that every manslrouldpaytowardsthe-expenses of the State in proporon to the wealth he possesses. " hatthepresentincome and propertytax laws have tak-en an untrue and arbitrary distinction for levying taxation between wealth called 'property,' and wealth called ' income,' where no such distinction exists in fact ; both kinds of property being wealth of precisely equal value according tot eir tmount, and equally requiring tlhc expenses and protection of Government. Take, for example, two sums of 5001. each, one invested and called ' property,' and the other caled ' income ; they are both wealth, both of equal value, both equally benefitted by Government protection and laws, yet the former pays no tax whatever, but only the income or interest of it is taxed at Is. 4d. in the pound, while the latter pays the income-tax of Is. 4d. in the pound cn the gross amount, and thus is one property made to pay about 20 times as much tax as another of precisely the same value. " That the income-tax laws do thus virtually exemptfrom direct taxation the larger part of the taxable wealth of the nation, namely, all that is not called income, and extort an extraordinary war expenditure from taxed income alone which is the smaller portion of the national wealth; and, as our Government and Leslators are selected from the c&asses chiefly interested eIther by Themselves or their connexions in the propert Thus virtually exempted, the people are apt to infer that This favoured exemption is not accidentatal, and they regard it as a gross case of class legislation. "That the evils of this taxation are traceableCto the unjust prnciples on which it is based. Among other anomalies, it tis assumed to be a tax on net income, while the laws realize this assumpton in few cases, except on incomesfrom salaries and from funded property. Even the income arising fromlandpaysonits grossamount,whichis relativelyunfair, because of the many necessary deductions in expenses, while the income arising from property in houses is in a still worse condition. "That the injustice of taxing industrial incomes,which are necessarily precarious and uncertain, at the same rate, as incomes from fixed property, is so generally admitted as to require no comment. " That the unequal pressure of the income-tax, and the inquisitorial un-English mode of its assessment, render it odious, and tend to goad the industrial community into a state of hostility to the Government. "Thatthesecrettribunalswhichaidthelocalconmissioners and Government agents in the assessment of the tax on indushial incomes, together with those commissioners and agents, are practically clothed with despotic power, so that the amount of the taxation of each individual is, in fact, at the arbitrary discretion of men who are amenable to no tribunal, and who are not even responsible to public opinon. "That the moral feeling of the commusity is thus arrayed against the income-tax laws, and evasion of the tax is regarded merely as the means of self-defence against extortion. "'That from these various cans's a proper collection of the tax becomes absolutely impracticable, and the greater the necessities of the Government, and the more stringent the efforts to collect the tax, the greater is the oppression practised upon those who are trathful in their retuns while evasion of the tax is proportionably increased. ' Thatyour memonalistsbelieveasimple remedyfor these evils may be found in the capitalization of all incomes, and the conversion of the tax into a property-tax upon such capitalization, according to the plan suggested by the Income-tax Reform Association, established in Birmingham in 3May, 1855. And that a remedy may be also found against the inquisitorial powers of the tribunal before referred to by the adoption of the plan proposed for the assessment of the tax on industrial incomes by that association, a copy of whose address has been sent to each member of the Government who is a member of the House of Commons. "In the draughtof a rePOrt proposedtobe adopted by that able financial reformer, the late Mr. Hume, as a member of the Committee of the House of Commons on the Income and Property Tax, in 1652, he states that,-' All the property in the united kingdom and the canitalized imcomes of the industrial classes should be assessedat an uniform and equal rate. As the revenue of the country is expended for the protection of property or of personal rights, and for objects of national utility, your committee can see no valid reason whatever why every subject of Her Majesty should not be taxed in proportion to his means; to levy a tax on a small portion of the property of the country is inequitable and dangerous.' "Your memorialists also record the fact that another distinguished statesman, a member of that committee (Mr. Disaei),prposd,when in office, to recognize the pm-i cpeof a distinction between the taxation of incomes from fixed property and incomes dependent on precarious sources, and theybelieve that had that commrittee exeamined witnesses as to cases of oppression and abuse of the law, its members must have reported in favour of a property-tax and against the continuanec of a tax upon income. *" Your memorialisls in conclusion, respectfully request you will propose in Parliansent at the earliest possible portunity a remedy for the evils of -lsich they comnplain. They believe that a small tax upon property (as distinguished from income) would raise with greater facility than the present income-tax the requisite funds for defraying the expenses of Government, and that, if fairly assessed, it would be cheerfully paid; while the inijustice of the present tax cannot fail seriously to embarrass the Government by aggravating the people. -" Your inemorialists are convinced that a graceful and prompt concession to the just claims of the people will increase the revenue, strengthen the Government, and afford the most powerful developnient of our national resources."

These causes infusedza timely caution amnong buyers in this market, and, no doubt/ prevented much speculation-a cautionuwhich buyers have not apparently much regretted on reflection; seeing that yesterday and to-day a much calmer atmosphere has pervaded the market. There has been a considerable business done in the aggregate during the three days, where sellers were willing to take the prices asked on Tuesday and then declined by buyers, and which amounts to an advance of about Ad. per lb. on yarns, and in some instances to arise in the same proportion on coths. In heavy domestics there is not much inquiry, but for the better kinds of longeloths, some descriptions of Tloths, and 40inch shirtings there has been a rather active business, and p rices are firm at the full rates of Tuesday. Spinners have done a larger business than manufacturers, but the advance asked of A8d. to id. per lb. has checked demand. BLMINGHAM, JN. 19. The iron trade of South Staffordshire is represented by those e ively connected with itas healthy and ste;d The demand for merchant and bar rods contiues to he good, but sheets and boiler plates are not at the present tiie in great request. The trade in the latter desenptions of iron is not usually brisk during the winter months, but as soon as the time arrives for shipments to the St. Lawrence; it is stated, an abundance of orders will immediately find their way into the market. "An Iromnaster" says,-'A fair amount of business in pig iron has been done, and there is a good demand and at better rates than ruled for the greater part of last quarter. It is only for interior makes that the demand is slck. Frome the requirements for pigs a judgment may be formed as to the orders in hand for malleable iron. When these ire scarce any quantity of pigs may be readily purchased; when they are abundant thegreatest difficulty is experienced inobtaininga supply. Atthe present time.there are very-few sellers of forged'hisy and there are large houses who are sending out pig iron to be worked up into puddled bars whose own make is not sufflicieht to 'supply the mills."' The princpal topic of discussion among the iron trade during the present week has been the proposed increase of freightages tor the conveyance of ore into South. Staffordshire by the London and North-Western, Great Western, and other railway compauies, who, with the canals with which they are connected, have the enitire possession of this district. It is considered that this attempt on the part of the great Carrying establishments, if successful, wl be highly injurious to the iron trade. The authority wre have already quoted in reference to this subject says,-" We (the ironmasters of South Staffordshire are at least ls. Per ton worse off than the Welsh masters in deliveries to the Thames, and about os. per ton for delveries to the Mersey. Nor must it be forgotten that the very red ore from the port of Barrow, which is advanced in price by the raising of the freights inland, does not cost tihe South Wales consumers a farthing a-ton eitra, thmus again placing us in a worse position to compete with our more fortunate rivals, who are so much better situated f6r coiast deliveries." The leading ironmasters contend that this policy of the railway compames, if pursued, will prove injurious to themselves, as well as to the reat manufacture of the district, and that it is also against the spirit, if not againstthe letter, of the act of Parliament by virtue of which their lines were constructed. At present an answer to their representations to the directors of the London and North-Western Companyhas not heen received; but, excepting with regard to the charge of lId. per ton for conveyance npon sidings to the works, no great hopes are entertained of its being favourable to the iron trades. So early a combination between the london and:North-Western and Great Western Companies for the advancement of freightages has erxated some degree of surprise, even among those who anticipated the ultimate occurrence of such an event. There is no falling off in'-the demand for coal, and the requirements of the metroolis and the southern parts of England, by the Oxford, Vorcester, and Wolverhampton Railway, continue to increase. As might be expected with these new calls upon the resources of the district, and the renewed activity of the iron furnaces, prices are well miiaintamed. The best descriptions of coal at Pelsall and Brownhills are much sought after, and for domestic purposes are fetching high rates at the pit's mouth. Great exertions are being made in the neighbourhood af Wednesbury to clear some of the old mines of water; for it is clear that should we have a long winter, and the irob trade prove as brisk as anticipated, the want of a sufficient supply of coal at reasonable prices wil occasion great inconvenience to the manufacturin" interests. The heavy ironfoundries in rhe neighbourhood of Dudley and Smethwick are not so busy as they were some months ago, although they cannot be said to be decidedly slack There are few extensive contracts on hand for public works; but the orders for the smaller descriptions of general foundry are more numerous than a few weeks ago was expected. The chain manufacture, more eseciallyfor marine purposes, is active, the orders for the Gtovernment dockyards affording abundant employmnent in many of the leading establishments. The inteligence of a prospect of peace, communicated by 17ie nimer of Thursday, created a great sensation imong the Binninghamn manufacturers. At the time the news arived a considerable number of the ironmasters of the disrict were, as usual on-Thursdays, assembled on'Change. It was received with mingled satisfaction and distrust. No branch of commerce is more interested in the return of peace than the iron trade of South Staffordshire. It is true that in a time of war many establishments are extensively engaged in the manufacture of munitions, but this is far more than counterbalanced by the restriction which at the present time is placed upon the exportation of iroii to the north of Europe. The return of peace would, in the opinion of our best informed ironmasters, give an inunense impetus to the staple manufacture of South Staffordshire. The occurrence of such an event would, however, coupled with the new establishment at Enfield, have a very different effect upon the prosects of the gunmakers and sword cutlers of this town. At present both branches are weU employed; a cessation of war would necessarily cause, as on former occasions, an extreme depression, from which it would require years to recover. The present supply by the Ordnance contractors is said to be from 2,500 to 3,000 muskets per week; the average number of bayonets being considerably in excess. These contracts, which, as we stated last wreek, are continuous, would in case of peace, in all probability, be for the present supnded, and a great diminution, of employment be the consequence. The chief factors' establishments of this town andWolverhampton represent the country trade in Birmingham goods as exhibiting decided symptoms of improvement. The period is rather too early to speak with confidence of the spring home trade, but so far appearances are promising; as compared with the corresponding peried of lastyear they are encouraging. The deficiency which has recently been noticed inthe exports of hardware, more particularly to the, continent of Europe, is thus likely to be suppliedbythe demands of the home market. Building operations usually set in early in the spring, and in anticipation of these requirements the manufacturers of steel toys carpenters' tools, em.) nre m6re active thn mthey have been during the winter. The German tools of inferior quality obtain a good sale, but they fail to supersede the superior makes of the Birmingham manufacturers. For good worsmen in this branch of busness there is ample employment. The demand for all descriptions of cabinet brass-foundry is also upon the increase, and the prices which haveruled for so long a period are firmly maiiitained without any symptoms of a reduction. The manufacture of gas fittings, which usually declines in the fiat quarter of the year, ma now active, large quantities of these articles beig required for exportation. The same improvement is observable in somebranches of the iron and copper.tube businesses'required for locomotives and ships' boilers Saddlers' ironmongery, if not quite so active as it was during the time army contracts, to a greater extent than they are at present, were in the district, is still in considerable demand, and will doubtless, together with other articles of local produce, improve as the spring advances The great difficulty experienced by eommereial men on their joumeys continues to be the inability or unwillingness of 'their customers to make prompt payments in cash. Stocks of anl descriptions of hardware are low throughout the country, and orders are now vretty freely given; but bills, and some at long dates, constftute, it issasd,thorulingmede in payment. It is unnecessary to say that wvith the present high rate of discount, even for the best of paper, such roodes of payment are somewhat inconvenient to a considerable proportion of our manufacturers and factors. While, however, the home trade is improving, there is little at present to be said favourable to our Present commerce with foreign countries. The demand for Birmingham manufactures in the Brazils is far from brisk, althoulgh somewhat betterthan six months ago. The South American and West India orders which have arrived by the packets this week are said by the Toum-al of this morning to be light'; and those from Australia are more limited than was expected.. The commissions from New York and Boston during the week have been smaller than were anticipated for general hardwavre, but, accordingto the letter by which they were accompanied, shoud present pugnacious symptoms ahate, succeeding malls will bring good orders and satisfactory remittances. 'The affairs of the LichfieldBanlc are not likely to prove so satisfactory as upon the first announcenient of te bankruptcythe publie were led to believe.

Considerable excitement and dissssion have been created in manufacturing and commercid 'ircles here in consequence of the alleged dispositiom-n the peat of Russia to make concessions calclazted to lead $. c be re-establishment ofpeace; but very few areof opnion that the terminatiot of the war is near at hand. There seems to be a prettyi general impression that we shall have at Ieast onenore cnemo paign, and awish that we may, if another year of earnest warfare be calculated to make the peace that should resulu - the more lasting. Business operations are but little infu., enced by these rumours, our merchants having so adapted themselves to the present condition of things as to be ready eitherforqeaceorwar. Averycheerfulfeelingperradesallour - business circles, and a confident impressionexasts thatfuture operations will become more and more satisfactory. During the past week there has been an increased demand forhosiery, principally for the home suppl. The spring.trade is opening quite assatisfactoryasmanufacers anti Lted ans the improvement is very decded when. compad wiitl the state of business this time last year. There, however, is very little shipping, American orders being now completed. There also is a decided improvement in the tone of theLacemarket. Some descriptions of lain nets cannotbepurchased in suffcientahundce, and fortfurhergoodsandsome ether fancy laces there is apretty good demand. .hlthough the operations of the American buyers were, for the fall trade, more extensive than usual, they seem not to have brought sufSicient, as very extensive additional orderaiarive by almost every steamer. .This is a new and very pleasing feature. The general demand likewise is equal to expectation. In our review of the operations of the past year, in tva reviousreports, we described the leading features of the ace and hosiery manufacture; and now we can refer with equal satisfaction to a subsidiary branch of business which is making wonderful progress here. We allude to the throwing of silk. Up to a very recent period our hosierand lace manufacturers were chiefly dependent upon Derbyand other towns for material. `ow, as far as silk is concerned, we are pretty nearly independent of extenal aid; and progress is Yn-ig in the doubling of cotton. There is no reason why spinning should not be done here also. Ver large establishments for silk throwing have been erected or are now erectig, by fessrs. Gill and Co., Walsh and: Windley, Patterson, Clarke, Baxter, Bottom, and otherg, and all are fuRly and profitably occupied. The effect of this upon the silk throwsters of Verby has been very serious; hence the numerous failures in the silk trade which have: taken place there. Both for the manufacture of hosiery 2nda lace, but ptscularly for the latter, the material requires very care. preIration, and parties upon the spot can -ater better for the requirements of the several branches of the manufacture than can those who reside at a distance. Building operations have been carried on almost uninterruptedly, notwithstanding the war. In addition to som2 portions of the silk mills above alluded to, liany factories have been enlarged or built, and the number of dcwelling. houses which have been erected is tmly surprismg. This, combined with the many otlher pleasing characteristics we have during thelastthreeweeks describedasbelongingtothis town and its manufactures, shows a degree of elasticity and soundness which mnst result in future greatness. In order to retain theposition that the genius of our mechanicsand the - enterprise of our manufacturers and merchants have attained, a watchful eye must be kept upon the efforts of our French competitors. We must equal them in design, finish, and quaiity, as weU as beat them in price, and most of the markets of the world may continue to be supplied with the lace and framework-knitted products of the town of Nottingham. LEICESTER, Jis. 19. In fancy goods connected with the hosiery trade there is a tolerable demand; the home-trade is, however, less active, and is indecd wingraoredepressed. Inconsequenceof the dulness of tne home and country trade the operatives are suffering considerably, and this week the number of outdoor reciplents at the union-house is upwards of 1,000 increase upon the number relieved in the corresponding week lastyear. Thereis, however,abetterprospect, asextensive contracts are expected fromthe Admiralty. 3anufacturers stiU complain that they cannot obtain a remunerative pice for their goods, as, notwithstanding the increased= valeof ,nno propotionate advance for goods can be obtained.

The reports from the manufacturingtillages of this district continue to improve in character. From the increased demand which has set in for woollen cloths since the open. ing of the year, coupled with the lowness of stocks and the general aspect of trade, manufacturers are graduallyinereas. mug their work, and there is nearly a fllU average of employment for most classes of the operatives engaged in the woollen manufacture. The business done at the varehouses of this town this weel, those en"aged in the foreign trade as well as those in the home branch, has been good, and there was, even before the news of Russia's acceptance of the terms of negotiation had come to hand, mach confidence ex. pressed that -weshouldhave a satisfactorytrade forthe spring months at least. It is difficultto tell precisely whateffect thenews referred to has bad in a commercial point of view. The markets to. day in our cloth-halls have certainly been cheerful as to toneo andvriceshve been. fmnly held, and not very difficult to realize,-but purchases appear to have been made for insmediate vwants, and scarcely to so large an extent as on this day week. Many are doubtless waiting to see how the coming negotiations progress, or how they end before they speculate at all, and we think until it be certain hvhat will in aU probability bethe end of the conferences of the great Powers the mar ets wil not be very brisk. Certain know. ledge that we have arrived at the advent of peace will an impulse to our staple trade, and "an honourable ;'d true peace" 'will be hailed with pleasure by all classes of the people; but at p resent there appears little confidence among our manufacturers and merchants that such a desirable event is near at hand. The feeling is little less thun universal that we had better continue the war than be sedueed or tricked into a false and inglorious peace, with a Power that has hitherto known no bounds to her spirit of ambitious aggression. Should the negotiations prove futile, the staple trade of this district, there seems reason tobelieve, wiU improve rather than faU off from its present- pstion The wool trade has remained without material change during the wreek. The demand for both combing and: clothing wools is steady, and holders are asking rather Ther priesor of the worsted trade at Bradford is to the effect that this w eek there has not been much alteration, but, if anything, the tone of the trade has np,roved. From Hialifax to-day's market report is as followvs:- "Wool still frn, with a rather upward tendency. In worsted and yarn no improvement." DUBLIN, JAN. 19. Trade has not yet recovered much of that buoyancy orelasticity which would enable it to flourish healthily, and roduce cheering commercial prosperity in all its branches. The restrictions to which the hitherto troubled condition of the political 'world and the consequent high price or money had subgected commercial operations have not been relaxed; and we have accordingly to report that the current w.-eek has net been much less duU in business circles than those which closed the past year and opened the p resent. The peace report, which reached town on Thursday, had influenced the holders of sugar, and the case.- q.nence 'was, that, at the sale on that day, at the Conmmer. cial-buildings, no business worth alludig to had been transacted. The tone of the Smithfield-market on Thursday was somewhat firmer, particularly for good qualty of beef; but the business transacted was not extensive. The provision-market was rather scantily supplied, and a slight advance took place in prices. The corn-markets were notsodull altogether as duringthe last week ortu-o. TheCustoms' receipts for the week to Thursday inclusive were 21,19R, against 18,2531. last week. The following is an abstract of duties received at the port of Dublin for the 'week ended January 12, 1856 :-Tea, 8,6351. Os. 3d. refined sugar 6447. 2s.

It were useless to criticize the stock and share-market in the present critical state of the war question. Up to Thursday the stockbrokers had adull enough wseek of it; but the excitement produced by the inteDigence of the forenoon of that day compensated for the monotonous months that preceded it. The apprehension, howvever, of actingfully upon newvs deemed " too good to be true" prevented prices from advancing here in proportionto the very considerable increase that took place in 1London. BELFAST, J.%. 18. Linen.-The very dull state of things that followed the close of the year has given way to healthy action, and for the last week brisker demand has been experienced in the linen trade. Exports of goods and yarns for the halfyear ending the 31st of December were 'well uTp to the mark of anticipation, and as the transactions partook, i alare proportion, of direct sales, or equally direct orders, the businessatogether was of a most satisfactory character as regarded settlements Several vears ago we noted the evils that followed the consigning system, 2nd particularly as regarded the American market. During the quietude of 1848 and 1849 it was not unusual to force sales by auction, and to push off goods in Broadwvay at rates considerably under their current value in the wholesale houses of Belfast. This enhealthy course of procedure is still more or less acted on, though we believe every, succeeding year finds its operation more contracted. America is at present the most important of all markets for ourtextiles, andthe people of this country are the largest consumers of Transatlantio products. 'llemoreequitably, therefore, that the sales of goods are conducted on both sides, the more successful and more extended vill be the exchange between the two countries. Brown markets were 'wel supplied vith goods durng the past weel. lirgan showed pretty largely in lawns, damasks, and diapers, and sales went off better than had been usual for the last few weeks. Our own market on Friday was moderately brisk, and of the usnal fabrics offered there a considerable quantitywas cleared off. Saturday's transactions at Ballyimena were pretty large; the nunber of webs sold ws much above that of the preceding market; and, onthe wvhole, full rtes ruled. busness. Weavers are at present slightly interrnpted in their labour by the tight frost; but in general the aggregate of producion is much shove last years average.
