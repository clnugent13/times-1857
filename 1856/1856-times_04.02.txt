Messrs. Smith and Co.'s contracts include the carriages on the London and North-Western, Eastern Counties, North London, London and Blackwall, Tdbuiry Fort, South Staffordshire, Stossr Valiey, and East Lncashireo and the stations of the North London, London and Blackwall, Souith :8taffordlshire, and Eastern Counties Railways. Prospectuses may be obtained on application to Messrs. Smith and Co., stating the terms upon which advertisements are displayed in the carriages or at the stations onthe above-mentioned lines, and every infomation may be had conerning these importanttmediums of publicity. The advantage of railway advertisingis toogenerallylmown torequireany leLgthened comment. The vast number of personswvhomust see an annoimcement displayecl in araSiwayearnage, the length of time duringwhich that announcement remains before their eyes; the comparative certainty that an advertisement so placed wSr be read through by passengers tired of the monotony of a long railway journey, and having nothing else to occupy their thoughts, render it far superior to any othermedilumforattracting generalnotice. At railway stations too, the crowds of persons going bythe train themselves, waiting for friends' arrival, or accompanying others to see them off, will generally be found attentitely percsing every bl displayed upon the station walls, as a means of passin time away tl the train arrives. With other modes of advertising, the announcement is glanced at in a cursory manmer, then thrown aside. Upon a railway, whether inside the carriages or at the station, it stands so long and prominently before the eyes of the public, thatthey arein a measure forced to read it. Messrs. Smith and Co. have different scales of charges, acording to the number of carriages or stations required by the advertiser, and to the length and importance of theodne of ralway chosen. To give a specimen of these erges, theywouldstate that advertisements can be displayedinlO0 carriages, aitherupon the London and North-Westem or the Easter Counties railway, for one guinea per month; or for advertising in every ' arae{sot89 on the latter line, the mont'cdyebarge is ;54.-157, Etrana 153re 385, S6.

The wanb of sysrem in marine assurance has been long ]Dnown to many merchants and ship-owners, and it was made publie by Underwriters themselves at an unusiually large attendance of members of Iloyd's, in consequence of a notice of motion in relation " to the condition of the underwriting business as it now exists."-See report of Meeting. The Times, 27th Marhb. If, in opposition to the present mode of determining rates ofpremium for marine risks, such rates of premium were regulated by the actual average ard total loss in each class of shipping-upon principles the same as LifeAssurance Companies regulate their rates of premium for life assurance, according to a system basl upon a theory of probabiities founded on ascertained results-a 1e-srranged certain profit maY be secured to the shareholders of a company undertakung marine assurance asis now the case in all well-regulated compamnes hich mdiertake 'dfe assurance, and the present speculative and unsatisfactory practice enstine withregardto maarseasumaucewouldbe abcolshed. In aworkupon life and marine assurance by the undersigned, published by Messrs. Longman and Co., February, 1854, referenre is made to a paper presented by him to the Institute of Actuaries, and pubishbed by the Coaneil In the Journal of the Jusitnte, July, 1855 in which certain limited rates of premium for marine risks are steciflea as deduced by the author from extensive classifications of losses at sea: and the statistics exhibited clearly indicate the practicability of the plan proposed. In the work the amonnt of property subject to marine risks and the limited opportunities for effecting assurances against loss is contrasted with the small amount of life assurances effected, and the numerous companies established for thatbrauch of assurance buminess. from which it is made evident thereis a great opening for Marine Assurance Companies, founded on an approved system for regulating theirratesof premium. The principles upon wsinch such companies may be advantageously established, and an outline of what has been alrcady dcentow ards acdassification of data is explained.

THE MUSICAL UZJION. This institution-the Philharmonic of chamber musiclas now reached its 12th season, a proof that the attractions ,which itpresents are not ephemeraL Thequartets, triosm and other conertantc works of the great masters are just as much worth knowing as their orchestral compositions; and the wide-f reading taste for tbhis species of music (especially amongthe higher classes-the stringed quartet having yet to find its Jullien, or its Hullah) is in a great meassure due to the MusicalUnion. Amorehe3lthykind of knovwledge could notbeinculcated, sinceinthisbranchoftheart,music appeals to the mind and to the feelings, on the strength of its own unaided purity. 2No such extrinsic fascinations are here enlisted to help it out, as at the theatre, or even as in the orchestra, where the mass of instruments is alone imposng, to say "othing of the exhaustless variety of which they are capable then genius invents and sdience elaborates. For this reason it is perhaps more difficult to write, and certainly more difficuilt for the uninitiated to understand, a good piece of chamber music than a good symphony. The stict attention bestowed upon the performances at the Musical Union is a favourable sign. It shows that the audience goes, not to talk but to hsten; ana thus, season after season, a greater familiarity is acqjuired with musicwhich, however refined and beautiful, might otherwise be left to the exclusive enjoyment of professors and con. noisseurs. The followingwas the programme of yesterday's concert (the first of the season) which drew a crowded and fashionable audience to Wilis's-rooms:- Quartet, in]D. No. .. .. .. .. Mozart Trio, D mninor (pianoforte). Op. 49 .. .. ..endeJssobn. Quartet, No. l, in F. Op. 1S . . . eetbovhn Solo. Violoncello. Solo. Pianoforte. The quartets, both fine examples of the masters (though the latter belongs to Beethoven's early style), 'were admnirablvplayed by XL Sainton (first violin), 2Ir. Carrodus (secona violn), Mr. HlWl (tenor) and XL Franchommne (violoncello). M. Sainton has attained the highest proficiency in this description of music. Mr. Carrodus Is a young English violinist who promises in time to rival the ablest foreigna professors. His master was ,oEaque, which accounts for his classical training. Of Mr. Hill, generally acknowledged to be the best player on the viola in this country, it is unnecessary to speak. I. Franchomme has long .enjoyed the re utation of being the Parisian violoncellistpeu eaellence. HTis tone is not ful but it is musical and pure; his mechanismis irreproachable1 and his style, though tinged with the French ultra-seti ment, may otherwise be unreservedly commended. He made an excellent impression in the quatets. IL Charles Ha116 was the pianist. In mechanism this gentleman has reached a degree of perfection which is rare, even in an age remarkable for great mechanical executants. His performance of Mendelssohn's superb trio, in force, rapidity, and sureness, could not possibly be surpassed. But his tone was too dominating for his companions. M. Hali vws playing on an instrument which for power and brilliancy we have nevei heard equalled, and against which a single violin and a single violoncello could have little chance of distinction with a pianist not incEned to be considerate. Such playing, accompanied by a numerous orchestra, would have been magnificent; but it was too boisterous for chamber music, which requires greater delicacy and closer attention to the balance of effect. We sa-rcely heard a note of the violoncello irn the passages of enscnzblc; and even M. Sainton, on the violin, appeared to have less breadth and penetation of tone than usauL EI trios (excePt in the daimsiest) each instar ment is of importance, and, if anyn e of the three unduly preponderates it is mach the sameo thig as when an actor peroists inu approuriatog to himself the most prominent position before the audience, although the course of dramatic indident demandscthat he should bcecome occasionally subordinate. This isjustly styled "unfair acting"' and, forasimilar reason, M. alle'splaying yesterday was Tunfair playing. ZtTL Sainton an dFranchomme were overwvhelmed; the fiddle of Stradivarins and the bass of Aanati were lost in the harmonious thunder of Broadwood's grand piano. The solos r ere welcome on account of the talent of the clayers; but the music in either instance was mediocre. pl i chonene does not sHie as a composer; nor 'was the monotonous "compaosi" of Chopin-which he introduced after lisa ow n effusion-to be greatly admired. MIoreover, theFPrench violoncellist is heard to much less advantage as a soloist than in quartets. His o.xpression is exaggerated; and he betrays a tendency to that objectionable manner of gliding, asitwere, frornone nlote to another, which hasbeen |suggestively denominate " sniauicinent." 3L Halle executed wi-th splendid energy and ufailing accuracy a glnulxC ptnicfChopin, whEich is about as ike apolonaLce as a duet is lile a fiddle. A more uncouth and extravagant rhapsody never proceeded from the heated imagination of that clever but over-estimated Polish musician. Such fine play-. ing, howrever, as IM. HaIIe's would have made a still more, incoherent composition interesting.
DUST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As a fellow parishioner, allow me to corroboratetheremarks of " labitans in Sicco," on the dust niuisance of St. Margaret's, Westminster. M1y locality (Knightsbridge) is a hamlet of the above parish; consequently under tne same Westminster District Board of Works. Now, if thereis one locality in this metropolis more than another requining the service of the watercart, it is William-street, opposite Albert-gate, for durin the whole of the dusty season it is: one of the crowded thoroughfares for cariages and equestrians-also frequently the route of Majesty from and into lIyde Park; yet, during a 17 years' residence in this street the parish authorities have never given the road any watering. Iland mny neighbonrs somne years hack applied for a. remedytothisintolerable uisance, when one of the old vestry took great pains to prove that our locality was a sort. of bantliog that neither the local nor general act gave the vestry power to water; consequently, we bailed the passing of Sir B. Hall's hil as a boon that would sweep away tins anomaly. Trusting your columns will advocate that all the butffling: thoroughfares of this dusty metropolis be vell watered in future when reouired. I am. vnurs nhpAi,nV-f - EDAV. D. !)OUGHTY. 4, William-street, lKightsbridge, Aprl 1. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent "Habitans in Sicco' has sot. yet, I fear, gone through the list of official circuinkicutions. The local Board of Works for Westminster has, if I .;n not roistaken, as little to dov,ith the Brbad Sanctuary as the 3Metropolitan Board. That favoured district is. under tho prentaldespotism of Sir B. Hall, the President of Her MIjesty's Comrniusioners of Woods and Works; and it is to him that "HtTabitans in Sicco" should address his prayers or his complaints. No doubt the hon. member for ldarylebone, who was sovery severe upon the mode in -which parochial authorities neglected the performance of their duties, would t . once remedy the evil complained of if it wrereofiaLbrnh before his notice in due red-tape forrn. officialy brovght.

REsToRwioN Or GLASGOw CxamDr.sL. -This -cathedral was reopened for public worship on Sunday -by the Very Rev. Principal IIacfarlan. The a'tendance ;was laxge, but by no means crowded, and there was nething in the way of a demonstration; in fact, the only allusion made to the circumstance was a slight one in the course of the first prayer. The alterations are all nearly completed, and, x hen occupied by the congregation, the effect of the edifice is magnificent. The preacher is qui'e audible 'withont the proposed screen between the nlave and choir, and it is to be hoped that idea 'will be aiban doned. The change is the removal of the pnlpit, pews, and galleries from the choir or Inner High Church, and the substitution of stalls and benches, in the cathedral style, in keeping with the character of the structure. The immense, unsightly window,which rose above the rood loft or organ-gallery, and which shut in the nave from the choir, has been completely removed, and the "pow-headed" windows which separated the latter from the Lady Chapel have also been taken away, and thus the eye can now range over in unbroken survey. the whole interior from east to west in all its beauty and sablimity. The waDs, north and south, are lined 'vith exquisitely-carved stall, fitted up in divisions or elbow seats, -with al' the convenience of a first-class railway car-riage. The woodwork to the back is designed and execated in the Gothic style, so as to be in close keeping 'with the general architectural features of the cathedral. The area is nttedup with seats or benches, having very handsome and finely carved tops. Irrespective of a smal! gallery, there is accommodation for about 1,000 sitters. This gallery is erected partially over the rood loft, and projects into tbe church. The projecting portion is sunported by 24 graceful oaken pilars, surmounted by fmnely carved capitals, and again above these, and on the face of the cornice, are 11 angels and shields of very delicate and surpassingly beau. tiful work-manship. The front of the gallery above the cornice is formed of crisped Gothic woodwork, to corespond vith the adjoining ancient stonework. Here there Will only be seating for 60 persons. It is roomy, and of a very elaborate character, the backs being cut out of solid oak, and highly ornamented. They have large stall ends, with elbows cut out of the solid, and the 'whole richly carved. The gallery is exquisitely beautiful of itself and would deserve admiration anywhere else; bhu, erected among, and partially concealing, the capitals of the beautiful columns, as it does, 'we cannot help thinking that it is here out of place and unnecessary. The sittings here are not to be let, like those in the area, but reserved for the Lord Provost and magistrates, when they may be pleaed to attend, and such distinguished public men as mr.y visit Glasgow. The pulpit is reared a few feet nearer the centre of the church than before. It is placed upon a large open platform raised eigliteen inches from the level of the floor. It is altogether- uncque of its kdnd in the city of Glasgow, and sttasupon a graceful octagon columnn 'with a rch: capit4,-fro)is rhich springs out afmnely chiselled cove, apon Phich.the -,lpit,rests. The pulpit itself is also an octagon, eh:qoigipartment being filled in with rich carved tracery, sx;rmiAted by a conice highly ornlamented. The whole of the pulpit is constructed of oalk which formed p art, of the origingl structure of the cathedral, and which thus >cainit be less than about 70D years old. This old oak is -surpassingly beautiful. The seating and alls are also entirely of oak, fully seasoned, but ot course of modern growtb. The passages are floored with beautiful tile-red, blue, and yellowv-of extraordinary hardness and finish, 'which have been supplied by Messrs. Minton, Hollis, and Co., Stoke-upon-.TrYent. These renovations have been worked out from designs by Xr. Mathieson, of the Board of Works,, sanctioned and revised by Ur. Burn, the chief architect of the Commissioners of 'Woods and Forests. Thel imprrovements, including the heating apparatus, will not cost less than 4,700!. Of this sum the corporation 'wil pay about 2,3001., being tbe cost of reseating the church in the manner described. In all, about 16,0001. have-been expended since the renovatioa of the cathedral, commenced some 15 years ago.-Glrrgl . Daily Aajl.

THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF FORTI- FICATIONS. Captain L. VERNON asked if it were trne that Colonel Harness, Deputy Inspector-General of Fortifications, had been removed fron that military office in consequence of departmental misunderstanding with the chief of the civil staff of the Ordnancec? Mr. MONSELL.-I regret to state that the course which Colonel Harness, while engaged in the discharge of his civil duty as Deputy Inspector-General of Fortifications, thought it proper to adopt with reference to myself has induced my noblefriend Lord Panmureto arrive at the conclusion that it would not tend to the public interest that Colonel Harness should continue to hold that office. It is only just, however, to Colonel Harness to add that both Lord Panmure and I have the highest possible opinion of that officer's abilities as a military engineer; and rmy noble friend has recommended the Commander-in-Chief to nominate him to one of the most important military appointments that an officer in his branch of the service can hold-the comnmand of the Royal Engineers at Malta. Colonel DUNNE inquired what course was intended to be htken with regard to the three senior officers already stationed at Malta! Mr. MONSELL replied that this was not a matter of which he could take cognizance; but it was to be hoped that no suclh point of etiquette would be alloved to prevail against the appointment of the man wvho was best qualified for the office. (Hear, hear.) THE RECENT EXECUTION. Lord H. LENNOX asked the Home Secretary whether his attention had been directed to the circumstanceswvhich were alleged to have occurred at the execution of T. Bousfield, on Monday Last ; and, if so, whetber he would undertake to institute an immediate inquiry into the case ? Sir G. GREY replied that immediately his attention had been called to the subject he put himself in communication with the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, whose report lie had not as yet received. POSTAL COMMUNICATION WITH AUSTRALIA. In reply to Sir J. PA7.}GTON, Mr. WILSON observed that there would be no objection to Lay upon the table the memorial and plan of the Australian Association on the subject of postal communication Withl the Australian colonies; but he did not believe that, in the present state of circumstances, any advantage would result to the publc from the production of the documents in question. Mr. LINDSAY asked what steps, if any, had been taken by the Government for the conveyance of the mails betwveen this country and Australia? MIr. WIILSON explained that several offers for carrying out this object had been sent in to the Government, but they were stil under the consideration of the Post-office authorities. THE CHELSEA CRIMEAN COMMISSION. Mr. LAYARD asked when the commission or board of general officers appointed to inquire into the conduct of certain officers employed in the Crimea during the war was realy to have a sitting? (Hear, hear.) He also desired to be informed whether the inquiry was to take the range of the whole Crimean history, or was to be limited to a reception of the defence of the officers whose conduct had been impugned? Lord PALMERSTON.-I believe the board will sit almost immediately. (Hear, hear.) Some little delay has arisen on a matter of form, and several questions had to be settled between the Judge-Advocate-General and Her MLajesty's Government. As for the range or scope of the inquiry, that is indicated with sufficient clearness in the warrant that has been laid upon the table. The immediate object will, of course, be to inquire into the conduct of those officers who have made representations as to matters cdverted to in the report of the Crimean Commissioners; but, if in the progress of the business it should appear that there are other parties whose conduct ought to be investigated, I am sure that the board will not object to extend their inquiry accordingly. CAPITAL PUNISEMENT. in reply to a question from Mr. BiGGs, Sir G. GREY said, it was not the intention of the Government to propose anymeasure substituting private executions for pubEc executions. DEFECTIVE MORTARS. Mr. ALAT INS asked the Clerk of the Ordnance whether the Government had yet satisfied themselves of the validity of the charges made against the Messrs. Grissel in regard to the mortars supplied by them for the public service ? Mr. MONSELL stated that the explanation addressed to the Government by the Messrs. Grissell had been submitted to Lieutenant-Colonel Wilhot, the superintendent of the Government gan factory, but that officer had not made his report. Until that report was before the Government the papers relating to this subject could not be laid on the table, and it would be unfair to come prematurely to any conclusion respecting the charges preferred against the contractors. 31r. MALINS, amid loud cries or " Order !" gave notice that, unless this question received satisfactory explanation before Friday evening, he should himself then bring it before the House on the motion for going into Supply. CE NTRAL AMERICA. MIr. COBDEN.-It will be in the recollection of the House that about six weeks ago, in answver to a question which I put to the noble lord at the head of the Government, the noble lord stated that the correspondence between England and the United States relative to the Central American question had been brought to a close, and would be laid on the table of the house. I therefore wish to ask the noble lord when we may expect that correspondence to be presented to us ? Lord PALMERSTON.-I will inquire at the Foreignoffice, and let the hon. gentleman know to-morrow or the next day. The Foreign-office has been exceedingly occupied of late by other matters (hear), and some unavoidable delay may therefore have occurred in the collection and preparation of this correspondence. DIUTY ON MALT. Mr. E. BALL asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Government, when it discontinued the war duty on malt, on the 5th of July ssext, would also remit the extra tax of 5 per cent. imposed on that article-a burden which operatel very injuriously upon the trade? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said tLat the act relating to this subject provided that the war-tax on malt slhould cease on the 5th of July, after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of peace, at which period the previously existing duties on malt should be reverted to. under these circumstances, neither the hon. gentleinan nor the House could expect himn to enter into premature explanations on this subject, or to anticipate the financial statement which it %would be his duty to submit to the House, probably, before the end of the present month. (Hear.) COUNTY COURT JUDGES. Ir. ROEBUCK, in rising to move a humble address to Her Majesty, praying Her Majesty to give directions to the Lords of the Treasury that hereafter, in order to maintain the dignity and independence of County Court judges, each of those judges be paid a salary permanently fixed at 1,a00l. per annum, expressed a hope that this important question would not suffer prejudice from the unpopularity of the humble individual who had undertaken it. The interests of justice were deeply involved in the adoption of the resolution he intended to move; and if it were supposed that he had any personal object in bringing it forward, the House would probably be disabused of that impression by the course he would adopt before lie resumed his seat. It was fit that he should begin by briefly recounting the pregnant history of our County Courts as they now existed. The person who firstpropoundedto Parliament the establishment of these tribunals was Lord Brougham, to whom the country was greatly indebted for his valuable labours in tho cause of juridical reform. That noble and learned lord, when Lord Chancellor, proposed to. introduce a bill into the other house for the purpose of establishing County Courts; but the opposition he then encountered was too great for him, and it was reserved for the right hon. gentleman the present Chairman of Ways and Means Committees in thst house (Mlr. Fitzroy) th carry that desirable object into ebect, which was ultimately achieved by the passing of the 9t..nd 10thof Victoria, chap..95. That act gave these courts a jqnisdiction up to 20L., and directed the payment of fees t4 the judges, with power for thse Crown to Byathe slOe 1othof Victoria1,20hap.in lieu of fees. grant salahes oth exceedg of Vc in, lichap. 102, juriesdiption i31 4§911§°fs2 and pIvteotion czkel wam trans- ferred from the country commissioners to the judges of n County Coutts in the contry circuits; auD the judges of these tbibunals were declared incapable of sitting in Parliament. The 13th and 14th of Victoria, chap. 61, extended their jurisdiction to 501., and even, by the consent of the pirties to any. amount, including the trial of title-to real estates; and it also transferred to the Lords of the Treasliy the pwer oiginally given to the Crown to direct paymentof hsalaries cf these judges. The 14th and 15th of ictoria, chap. 52, authorized the judges of country circuits to grant warrants for the arrest of absconding debtors,~ *sn affidavit, for debts of any amount above 201. The 14th and lath of Victoria, chap. 100, empowered County Court judges todirect the prosecution of witnesses for peijury, and to comiinit for trial in default of bail. The 1oth and 16th of Victoria, chap. 54, while debarring these judges from practising m their profession, 1rovided that they should receive salaries not exceeding 1,500. nor less than 1,2001. He cited these facts to show how year by year the business went on accumulating in the ~County Courts, until, in fact, a great part of the civil litigation of the country devolved npon them. The 16thand 17th of Victoria, chap. 51 (the Succession Duty Act), gave a power of appeal from assessments to those courts where the sum at issue was not above S. By the Customs' Consolidation Act a similar power of appeal was given in cases of conviction up to the amount of 100g. penalty; while by the Charity Trusts Act jurisdiction in charity trust ecses, where the income did not exceed 301. per annum, was likewise vested in judges of country circuits. The Common lawProcedureAct, 17th and 18thof Victoria, chap. 125, also authorized the judges of Westminster-hall to refer causes involving questions of account to the County Court judges. By the 2riendly Societies' Act judges of County Courts were empowered to wind up the affairs of friendly societies. The Hlouse would see from tbis statement that there was ba'rdly any subject involving civil procedure which might not be brought before the County Courts. T'hose courts, it must be remerabered, were very seldom aided by a jury or by counsel; they were called on to adjudicate upon various matters of law, and the powers conferred upon them were very extensive. The resolution he intended to submit to the House proposed, in the -first place, to make the salaries of County Court judges equaL There was, he believed, an opinion in some quarters that the merit of a judge was to be measured by the number of cases he decided and the a2mount of money which those cases involved, as if the great laws of this country were not dependent very often uponcases involving a very small amount. (Hear, hear.) Why, the great question of ship money turned upon a case which involved only 20s. (hear, hear); and a judge who decided only 100 eases, each of small amount, involving only a few shillings, might be called upon to exercise greater judicial knowledge, greater judicial acumen, and greater powvers of mind and of temper than the judge who decidedcasesinvolving thousands of pounds. A series of judges having, then, been apointed throughout the country to try certain cases, they ought to be men of equal ability, and if it was determined to have men of equal ability the country was bound in honour and in justice to remunerate them equally. In his opinion the salaries of County Court judges ought in all cases to be fixed andequaL He was sure it would be universally admitted that, ever since the Revolution, the judicial officers of this country had been distinguished for their independence. By a law passed in the reign of William HII. the judges were rendered independent of the Crown, and so great was the jealousy entertained lest the judges should be in any measure subjected to the influence of the Crown that it was now the custom for judges to go to Court to pay their respects to the Sovereign only once, and that was upon their appointment. But the County Court judees were brought hat in hand to the Treasury. (Hear, hear.) One of the acts of Parliamenit to which he had before referred provided that the salaries of those judges should not be less than 1,2001. or more than 1,5001., the apportionment of the amount being left in the hands of the t}easur. The County Court judges-the most important judges of this country-were therefore required to bow down to the Treasury benches for the increase of t.heir salaries from 1,2001. to the maeximnum of 1,500L. a- year. It happened to him once, in the days when Lord Melbourne was Prime Minister, to have a grievance. He went to Lord Melbourne, and he should not easily forget the observation of that noble lord :-" It's all veryfine." said Lord Melbourne, "to call me Prime Minister, hut why don't you go to Johnny 1" (Loud laughter). He (Mr. Roebuck) hat no desire to "go to Johnny" Ilaughter); he made his application to Lord Melbourne, and the accuracy of that noble lord's opinion was proved by thefactthat his grievance remained unredressed. It was all very well to say that these questions of salary were decided by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the First Lord of the Treasury, but the man who really settled those matters was the Secretary of the Treasury. (Hear, hear.) He would ask the House what they would t-hink of the honour and independence of the judges of this country if the judges of any court should have to bow down to the Secretary of the Treasury? (Hear, hear.) HIe would have to charge that hon. gentleman (Ir. Wilson) with something like a dereliction of duty, and he would make the charge in plain terms, that neither the hon. gentleman nor the House might misunderstand it. Before he stated the charge, however, he would entreat the House to consider what an honourable and learned man would be likely to undergo before he would go cap in hand to the hon. gentleman. It was his (Mr. Roebuck's) fate to have a brother-in-law who was a County Court judge, and who received the appointment, without any effort of his own, from the late L ord Truro. That gentleman came within every rule laid down by the Treasury, or rather by the hon. member for W^esthury (AIr. WVilson), which would entitle him, as a County Court judge, tothemaximumisalary; but hewas carefullypassedover. He (,Mr. Roebuck) put a motion on the notice book, which he was told by the Speaker he could not move, as it was contrary to the rules of the House. Wrell, the hon. member for Westbury came to him one day and said, "WVhat becomes of your motion to morrow 1" He (Mr. Roebuck) replied, " You know as well as I do that I cannot move it." '- Well,'" said the hon. member for Westbury, " that being the case, now I will tell you somethinlg. Your brother-inlaw"-he (AIr. Roebuck) had never spoken to the hon. gentleman about his brother-in-law-" has been for some time within the rule by which he is entitled to the ma.cimwun salary, hut as your motion was on the books lhe has not been appointed to that salary." Now, what did this case show?9 It showed clearly that in the apportionment of the salaries of County Court judges circumstances w ere re,garded wvhich ought to have no influence upon such arrangemenlts. (Hear.) What had the fact of his (Mir. Roebuck's) being brother-inlaw to aCounty Court judge to dowith the salary.that judge should receive?9 (Hear, hear.) Why, the miserable selfcomplacency of the hon. member for Westbury was hurt, and therefore justice was not done to a County Court judge because he was his (Mr. Roebuck's) brother-in-law. Belt that was not alL. In a Treasury minute of the 23d of August, 1853, with reference to the principle upon which the m:bimumn salary should be allowed to County Court judges, he found the following passages:-- " The number of causes tried caunot be considered as a criterion of the labour which falls on the judge, as the amount of labour required in country districts in travelling from court to court must be set against the greater number of causes tried in the metropolitan and other urban circuits. It i5, therefore, only by considering the amount of tha different labours peculiar to each circuit that the labour of the judge can be estimated, and, when such an estimate of each circuit is made, the difficulty remains of determining w;hich of the labours required by the judges should he considered as the most laborious, so as to be able fairly to decide in which of the different circuits the duties are the heaviest." In a Treasury minute dated October 6, 1854, there was the following very remarkable statement: "'The statement annexed to this minute shows the plaints enterad, the causes tried, the judges' fees, .and the amount sued for in each circuit for the years 1852 and 1853, ani the average for such years; and, these elements of the bus.- ness done in the courts having been aggregated in each circuit, as the best test which my lords can adopt, the different circuits stand in relationto eachother in the following order with reference to the aggregate amount of such elements in each." Then followed a list of circuits, and the muazimnuni salary was awarded to the judges of the 15 circuits first named. The judge of the 16th circuit was his brother-in-law. Well, it might have been supposed that the next judge to whom the uxaxirnuns salary was awarded would have been the 16th on the list. NWo such thing. No. 17 was the next, 19 the next, 28 the next, 37 the next, and 49 the next. So that, in fact, after the first 15, the ap- pintments were made lIjke the occurrences of a sick man's dream. Could it be said that No, 16 was passed over by mistake? He apprehended not. WVas not the number of causes entered larger in the case of 16 than in that of 49?7 Certainly it wa. There was also more travelling, and the amount of fees was greater. UJpon what ground, then, was 16 passed over? It could not be said that the Treasury authorities were net acquainted with the facts, for Mr. Falconer, the judge to whom he alluded, made frequent applicatio,ns to the Treasury, feeling that there was a slur cast upon him. He knew Mr. Fal.coner well; he had great affection for him, and knew that the paltry sum in question was not that which agitated his mind, but t]ie conviction that he was a marked man. His brethren knew him to be a distinguished judge; they knew that he did more work tha.n almost any other judge in the country, and yet they saw him passed over by the Treasury. WFhy ' There must be some reason. The world at large did not know the reason. He could guess it, .and the Secretary to the Treasury knew that he could. It was not that the hon. gentleman was told by his superiors to do so and so, but there were certain minds so constituted that they easily foundiout what their superiors desired, and no matter what the dirty work might be they wvere resady to do it. (A laugh.) He held in his hand a letter addressed by MIr. Falconer to the Lords of the Treasury on the 19th of February, 1855. It passed in review every one of the grounds which the Treasury authorities had assumed as those upon which they were to determine the right of a judge to a larger salary, and th s writershowed thaton each particular point he was bette: entitled to an increase than many of those who had bee ; promoted. Such being the case, what opinion would b. formed out of doors ? If a man in his position, with a fu'[1 knowledge of all that was passing before him, came to th - conclusion that the Secretary to the Treasury had passe ! over a worthy judge from political reasons, what would b the opinion of the putblic on the subject ? Did anybod believe that it would be supposed that the judges wer beyond corrupt influences ? Would it be supposed that th office of the Treasury, which was peculiarly interested in th dirty work of Parliamentary elections, and which could b proved to have slighted a judge for political reasons and to have mixed itself up with that which wa most degrading to human nature, could be cor rupt in one case and pure in another ? Not at all. I would be supposed-it was supposed-that Parliamentar.' influence governed its conduct in all cases, and that judge: were appointed and promoted, noS on account of thei merits, but upon political considerations. (Hear, hear.j But he had another case to st.ate tothe AHouse. certai i Afr. Morris was at one time sole County Court clerk for thcircuit of GLamorganshire, and he was also a great electioneering man in the same district. He grew tired of his work as clerk, and went up to the Treasury and there entered into certain terms, the result of which was as follows :-For the sura of 4001. a-year he resigned his office, andthe Treasurysuch was his own statement-gave him authority to a ppoint fill, not &mistnt, lerks for th s different courts in Glaor- -ganshire,-slthough-the right to miake auch-appointments be- longed to the judgess Mr. Morris exercised the power thus given to bim, and when, some time afterwards, the Government expressed a wish to divide certain of the dishtricts to which he had appointed clerks, one of those funetMonaries remonstrated, asaerting that he had bought his situation from Mr. Morris, who, not content with the .4001. a-year from the Treasary as compensation for giving up his clerkship, had actually been paid by the clerks for appointin gthem to their offices. Thefirst time thatXMr. Falconer heard of the transaction was when he -was told' that one of the clerks objected to haveLhis district divided, because he had paid Mr. Morris for it. Here, then, wa; a clear case of corruption somewlhere. He wanted some explanation of it, and he asked whether, after such.a statement of facts, it was so very plain that the House had done wisely in giving to the Treasury the power of ixin the remuneration of County Court judges? (Hear. hear.) He called upon the House to do away with this mischief by at onoe fixing the salaries of the judges and rendering them permanent. (Hear, hear.) Thus he got rid of the second part of his resolution. The third was to the effect that the salary of County Court judges should be fixed by act of Parliament at 1,5001. a-year. He had dtated his belief that County Court judges were the most important judges in the country. His 3reason for sayimg so was, that they decided upon the cases of the poor; that they disposed of a multitude of causes ;-and 2n many of the circuits had reduced the business of the othei judges to almost nothing. On the last Welsh circuit the judge had one case, which engaged his attention the greater part of one day, but he could come to no conclusion, and'at last the question wasreferredfor decision to a CountyCourt judge. (A laugh.) A County Court judge tried cases not byhundreds, but by thousands, and if he were right in supposing that the interests of the country were bound up, not with the amount of money involved, but with the number of causes tried and the class of persons engaged in litigation', then there could be no doubt that County Court judges,whose peculiar duty it was to administer justice to the poor,were the most important judicial officers in England. They bad almost utterly excluded from business the courts of Westminster upon circuit; they decided now in insolvency cases, in Admiratly ases, and, if parties chose, in cases of title. They did so at much less cost than the judges of Westminster-hall. It was true that they did not surround themselves with troops of javelin-men (hear, hear), and that they could not fine a sheriff 1001. (a laugh); but they attended to the business and interests of the country, and, high qualifications being demanded of them, we were bound to pay them liberally. (Hear, hear.) A very curious observation-more cullous as coming from the Treasury bench -had been made upon this subject. " Oh," said the Secretary to the Treasury, "we can get as many men as we like to fill the office of County Court judge-men quite up to the mark-for 1,2001. a-year." Let him apply the aryunentumn ad ihnminc7n. Did the hon. gentleman suppose that many men could not be found in that house and elsewhere to do the dirty work of the Treasury for less than 2,5001. a-year? (A laugh.) So in the case of the lord Chancellor, who had made a similar observation in the other house. Did anybody believe that scores of lawyers could not be discovered in Westminster-hall quite as capable as Baron Cranworth to perform the , duties of Lord Chancellor for onehalf of 10.0001. per annut? (A laugh.) And did the Chancelor of the Exchequer imagine that there were not hundreds of men, as able financiers as himself, ready to do his work for much less than 5,0001. a-year ? (Laughter.) That, tlen, was not -a criterion. The criterion was the custom of the country. Now, County Court judges were expected to mingle with country gentlemen-to take a position in society-and they were esteemed forthe station they held. It was of the highest importance that those who administered justice to the poor should be above the very breath of suspicion. (Hear, hear.) Hehad himaelf heard on circuit a prisoner object to being tried by any judge but | one in a red gown. The man fancied that justice would not be done to him if a " real judge," as he called him, did not try him. What was the meaning of that? Why, the prisoner, like all his class, felt that a judge in a red gown, occupying a high and distinguished position, which he-had attained by his talents, would be sure to do him justice, and he could not place the same confidence in a man with a short wig and black gown. Hence it was of the greatest importH ance that County Court judges, who were emphatically the judges of thepoor, should holda high position in publicestimation. It was of the utmost importance that the judges should be above the cares of this world, that their minds should be clear and competent for business, and that they should not betroubled by the anxieties of lfe, but should be really happy and comsfortable while doing the service of the State. To that endt hecontended that the nlmaximutm salary ap- paintedhby ]arliament was not more than sufficient (hear, hear);,and he asked the House, in its justice to those men, and in its consideration for the country, to apportion to them such a sum as would place them above suspicion above the breath of calumny, and above the anxietiesand the meannesses of the world. When the County Court judges were first allowved 1,2001. a-year they were permitted t) practise their profession; but when the 2naximum of 1 500. a-year wlas giveu- they were deprived of the liberty of undertakng private practice. That was a very proper provision if the judges were otherwise adequately re.. unerated, because he thought that no man in the position of a County Court judge should exercise his profession at the bar. (}lear, hear.) Hebegged to move the resolution which he had read. Lord STAINLEY, in seconding the motion, said that he had not niuch to add to the statement of the hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down ; more particularly as it was his intention to deal simply with the general question at issue, and not to enter into details of a personal or private character. He would briefly state to the House the manner in which Parliament and the Government had dealt vith the question of the payment of Connty Court iudges. When the office was firstcreated in 147 it was determined that the judges should be paid by fees ; but so soon as it was found that the fees amounted to a larger sum than had been anticipated, the Treasury took them into their own hands, and adopted the principle of payment by salaries. In 184S the salary was fixed at an average of l,OOOl. a-year inallcases, leavingstill tothe judges thepowecr of private practice. In 1852, consequent upon the popularity of the courts and the confidence reposed inthem, an addition was made to the amount of salary, and, upon the allegation that the remuneration allowed was not proportionate to the labour performed, an act wvas passed changing the salary from an average of 1,0001. a-year in all cases to a varying scale, of which 1,5001. was the maximuum and 1,2001. was the minimum. This increase, however, was more nominal than real, because thcsame act which augmented the official salary of the judge took from him his private practice, which had hitherto been a source of emolument. Thc consequence of the act then passed wa s, that the salaries were made to fluctuate at the arbitrary discretion of the Treasury, because, although various attempts had been made to adopt something like a uniformity of proceeding, yet, practically, the salaries did depend upon thefiat of the Tlreasury. (Hear, hear.) The system of fluctuating salaries once admitted, it became extremely difficult to adopt any principle upon which the amount to be paid in different cases should depend. The Treasury, in their minnte, had themselves repudiated the idea that the amount of fees should form the sole guide of the salary to be given. The next test proposed was the number of causes tried; but the actual number afforded no test of the relative importance of the causes. Again, it was said that the collective amount involved in the causes tried should be taken as a guide; but it by no means followed that those causes which were pecuniarily of the most importance should be so in a legal point of view, because cases of a comparatively smallamount might involve very complicated arguments, while others of a large amount might be easy of solution, and involve no legal difficulty. The only remaining test was the number of days which each judge sat, and the amount of travelling which he had i todo. It was evident,however. that that of itself must afford a very insufficient test of the amount of work done and of the value of a judge's services. Taking all these tests together-the amoumit of fees, the number of causes tried, the number of days that a judge sat, the amount of travelling that he did, and the aggregate sums sued for, some kind of vague and rough estimate might, perhaps, be formed of the importance of the labours of the different judges; but, in any case, that estimate must necessarily be so vague and so rough that it could not in any way take from the judgment of the Treasury that character which now attached to it of being arbitrary in its application. In fact, so long as the principle of graduation in the salaries of CountyCourt judges was persisted in there would always exist a suspicion of favouritism and partiality. (Hlear, hear.) Under these circumstances, he thought that the power of arbitrarily raising these salaries should not be left to the discretion of the Treasury, but that the salaries should henceforth be fLxed by act of Parliament, and should be equal in amount. (Hear, hear.). Then came the question w.hat that amount should be; and that was one which night be better answered by an appeal tocomumon senseand a reference to the salaries given in analogous cases than by argument. If authorities on the subject were required, how! ever, he n1ight cite the opinion of the noble lord at the head of the Government, who, when Home Secretary, said that he wvas inclied to think that the application of the rule proposed was by far too narrow, and that the mascimum salar should be much more extensively granted, if not extended ro an cases. Htear, hear.) Lord Broughamn, again, had expressed his opinion that it was most inconsistent with the character of the judicial office and with the due administration of justice that the judges should be paid, as it were, by " piece-work," for it was manifest that the same high qualifications, thesame-talent,thesameindustry, integrity, andhigh sense of honour were required in all judges alike. (Hear.) There appeared to be among the heads of the legal profession but one opinion w-ith regard to the propriety of fixing something defnite upon the subject, and he thouoht that it would be of the utmost advantage that specdyl Icislation should take place, and, if it did, that House would, e believed, be driven to fix upon a uiform rate of payment. (Hear, hear.) The business of the County Courts was increasing daily, and in proportion to that increase the confidence of the public in their usefulness was inereasing also, and everything should be done to add sti more to that confidence. As regarded the judges themselves, theirduties were of a very onerous description, and involved an amount of physical labour which rendered it inindicious to select men advanced in years for that office. The House should remember, also, that it was common for professional men ts rather overrate their own prospects of success, and therefore it was not certain that men perfectly quahfied for the office of Connty Court judge would be willing to accept a post the labour of which was certainly not less than that involved in the practice of their profession, unless a sufficient salary were attached to the office. 'Upon those two groumds, thenfirst, that in Ilis opnion the salaries of the County Court judges should be fixed and certain, and, secondly, that they ,hould be uniform, he had great pleasure in seconding the 3esolution. (Hear, hear.) Sir G. GREY.-I very much regret, Sir, that the discussion of this subject should have been mixed up with questions of a personal nature, not indeed bythe noble lord who has just sat down, but by the hon. and learned gentleman who has proposed this resolution (hear, hear), and I wisih, before my bon. friend rises to give that satisfactory answer which I am certain he wi be able to give to the charges -vhich have been made against him with so much bitterne3s by the hon. and earned member for Sheffleld, to state the course which the GoVerment has thought it to be its duty toadopt with regardto this subject. In sodoingI shall care fullyabstainfrom sayingoneword with regardtothose personal charge, audI will simply state the decision of the Government after a careful consideration of the question npon itsownmerits. The;nobl lorid hascorrectly stated that upont?e establishment of County Courts the judges were paid by fees, but he was not so accurate when he stted that the - Government, when they found that the fees exceeded the amount anticipated by them, put an end to that system of payment and substituted salaries. The fact is that the original act 'ontemplated payment by salaries; but, as at that period there existed no experience as to the fees which might be-expected, it wasproid6dl.that. power should be given to conmute the fees at a subsequent period into salaries. After a time it was evident that the. . payments of the judges were very unequal, some receiirtg tery large payment, while that of others was very.-m-, adequate, and then the aymen.t by fees was chauged to ;payment by salary. t that. time I held an, pimon-sn'd I have ne'ver smnce seen reason to alter' it-which is embodied in the resolution now DCbefore the House, namely, that the rate of 'payment should beuniform. (Hear, hear.) At a subseauent period theI rate of salary was proposed to be paid at a maximum of 1,500. a-yearaanda minimumnof lj200!., -andthatpropoal received the sanction of Parliament on the express under- standing that there should not be an uniform payment ef.' 1,5001., but that 1,50. should only be paid in those cases in-which it might be seem to those personsin whose hands the decisionwasleftthatthat salary was fairly earned by lthe labour performed, so thawt Parliament imposed upoh the lTreasury the duty of making thc distinction in the salaries o°f the judges- and that department did not, as assumed'by' lthe hon. and learned gentleman, take it upon themselves. I think that it would have been betterto have at frst fixed the amount of the salaries (hear, hear), because, notwithstanding the care and trouble which may be taken in conI sidering not the merits of the judges,-oecause in merit all l ought to be looked upon as equal-but the labour imposed lupon them, it is -impossible to avoid creating dissatisfaction lin the minds of those whose salaries may be fixed at the l lowver rate. (Hear.) This subjeet isoimewhichhasbeen fully considered by the Government, and Iwill say that we have apIproachedthe considerationof itwith no narrow feelingsofprejudice against the County Court judges, for we fully recognise the -value of their services-a value proved by several years of experience; and I am also prepared to say that the Government are of opinion that it vould be iljudged economy to pay those gentlemen in a manner that would not be adequate to secure the services of mnen of sufficient qualification, or which would not place them in that social position which they ought to occupy. A commission was appointed to inquire into the operation of the County Courts, and a bil embodying many of the recommendations, contained in the report of that commission has been hid before the other House ofParliament. In considering that bill the attention- of the Govermnent has been directed to the question of the salary, and we are prepared in the biU to which I have referred to lay down the principle that the County Court judges should receive a fixed salary. The next question which arises is, whether or no these salaries should be all equaL SNovi, to saythat they should all be made equal, is tantamount to saying that every County Court judge shall receive 1,5001 a-year. Now, looking at the nature of the duties performed, the question as to what would be a fair salary if we were to commence de -nero has been fully considered by the Lord ChaneUllor, whose opinion from his position is entitled to the greatest weight, and he has arrived at the -conclusion that L2001. a-year in addition to travelling expenses isa salary sufficiently large to securethe services of theinos competent men from Westminster-hall, and to ensure to them the social position necessary to them. We propose, therefore, in that bill to fix the salary at 1,2001. a-year in addition to travelling expenses, but we do not propose Ito take away from those judges who have now a Larger salary the sum above 1,2001. which they may possess during their tenure of office. I have now stated the course which the Government have felt it their duty to adopt aud the reasons which have actuated us. If we have been mistaken it is for this House to correct the mistake; but as there is a bill before the other House of Parliament upon this subject, which wil come down to this house, and as there is also another bil imposing additional duties on the County Court judges, I think that this House will be better able, when thoso bills come to be considered, to deal with the subject than upon a consideration of the question as now presented, and I hope that the House will be induced to take that couLrse, and not hastily pledge itself to giving to the 'County Court judges a salary of 1,500l. a;-year in addition to travelling expenses, but to postpone any decision upon the. subject. I should, perhaps, state here that it was at fist intended to defray the expenses of these courts by fees; but, in accordance with the recommendation of the commission, this bill proposes that the fees should be very largely reduced, the effect of which will be to throw a considerable burden upon the consolidated fundL The Government had, therefore, to consider what, under these circumstances, would be a fair arrangement with regard to the slaries of the County Court judges, endthey came to & the cons that they should not be justi{ied in proposing to impose upon the pubgec an additional burden oE 28e,0001 a-year, which woould be the case if the salaries were raised to the uniform rate oE 1,500a. No doubt, it will be far more satisfactory to the Lord Chancellor in the exercise of his patronage ifat e County Conrt judges all receive 1,5001; the Lord Chancellor could have no motive to proposig an iadequate salary for these gentlemen; and the Gdovefenent were actuated solely by a consideration of what was due to the public. (Hear, hear.) I don't pretend to say that we have been infallible, butm will ask the House not hastily to assume that the payment to the County Cout judges is inadequate, but to decide only afteradue consideration of the case. Not askig the House to negative the proposal of the hon. and learned gentleman, but only to suspend their judgment until the b-lIto which I have alluded comes before them and they are in a position to decide safely and satisfactorily, I beg therefore to move the previous question. (Hear.). Mr. MOR,RIS defended his namesake, formerly the County Court clerk of Glamorganshire, from the charge brought against him by the hon. andolearned member. 3r Morris was a gentleman at the head of his profession in that district of the county, enjoying the coniidence of the public forhigh character andabilty, and wtas one of the clerks who retired tpon an annuity, fixed by the Secretary for the Treasury atw4( h a-year. lan lother county 600!. a-year had been given, and he, in compaey with btr. orris, waited upon the hon. gentleman (t- Wilson) on the sube ject. That hon. gentreman was, however, inemorable, and showed throughout the utmost vigilance for the public iHterest. (hear, hear.) He denied that in the whole transaction there was the least senblance of a job. Mr. WILSON was extremely sorry to intrude upon the House in a personal matter of this kind, but he hoped hon. members would feel that this motion savoured much more of a private than of a public character. Perhaps they would be astonished to hearthat he hadreceived no intimation of the course which thc hon. and learned member (Mr. Roebckx) intended to take on this occaifon; but, probably, after the experience of other hon. gentlemen as to the course frequently taken by the hon. and learned member in this house, he ought not to feel surprised, orto complain of this. He was, however, able to gire at once so simple and, he hoped, so satisfactory an account of this matter that he thought the hon. and learned member would find he had taken nothing by his motion. According to the County Courts Act of 1852, the salaries of the judges, as had already been stated, were raised from 1,0007' to 1,2001. as a minimnum,7 1,5001. being fixed.as a oluyCournt. In March, 193 (speaksing from recollection as to the date) the Home-o'dice forwarded to the Treasury the memorial of 14 judges, beth metropoetan and country,s Tho thought, from the amount of busiess transacted in their respective courts, that they were entitled to the undemr salary. Upon lootig into this matter, his right hon. friend (Mir. Gladstone) and he felt it to be one of such extreme difficulty, involving so many elements of consideration int judging of the duties of the various judges, that they were disposed in the first instance to refer it to the County Court Commission, then sitting. The commissioners however, did not consider that the salaries of the County Court judges came within the scope of their daties. They then attempted to induce the Lord Chancellor to ask this commission to take the sutbject into consideration, but in this also they failed; so that, as they could not obtain higher and better authority than their ovwn in deciding upon this professional question, they were themselves forced to undertake- to discover a principle upon which the difference made between the respective salaries should rest. lle might here state that neither he nor his Iight hon. friend wrere aware of .the names ofz the County Court judges. For himself, he might say that, w,ith the exception of one singie judge, MDr. Pollocl;, wvho presided over the Liverpool Court, he did not knowv the nanme of one of these gentlemen. (Hear.) The practice was to deal with the 60 circuits by numbers, so that thenamnesof the judgesnever formed a subject of con,sideration. The wvhole of the various elements upon which the qjuestion of the respective salaries depended was drawn out in great detaiL. Eirst of all there was the number of plaints, but plaiuts were often entered in populous districts merely for getting a settlement of accounts. Then the rumber of tials did not always indicate the importance of the business. The number of days of sittilug, too, was not altogether satisfactory, becau2se some judges possessed a greater facility for disposing of business than others, and were willing to undergo a greater amount of labour. Again, the fees received did not furnish a satisfactory means of deciding, because they rather indicated the amount of business entered in the court than what was really done by the judge. At last it was determined that the whole of these elemnents of consideration shorld be aggregated tegether, and the 15 judges who appeared to have the largest amount of business, as tested in this way, were to have the maximnum77. salary. When the different elements he had described were thrown together, the largest number was 89,000 and the lowest 16,080, which showed the immense difference in the amount of duty performed by these judges. (Hear, hear.) The lowest in point of number among the 15 selected came to- close upon 50,000, and at that point there was a fall of 5,000. He at that tine had not the slightest notion that the lon. and learned gentleman had a brther-in-law a judge of a County Court, and his right hon. friend, he wvas quite sure, had no idea who was the 16th on the list, or below the 2zaximum rate. All the jud-es above the 16th named-in the minute of the Gth of October, 184, had assignedtothem the maximum? salary of 1,01., and those below that scale were left by the Treasury as they previously were. Among them, it appeared, was hr. Ealconer, the brother-in-law of' the hon. and learned member. In passing that minute the lords of the T'reasury felt that there might be some cases which from individual circumstances might require further consideration, and a passage was there-. fore inserted in it directing that if any such ewe arose its claims should be considered. The hon. and learned member had saXted that very soon aterwarXds more judges were added to the list of those who were ioreceivethe maximum sakry- and he-aid -that-No..-6i (being that of his brother-in-law) ws p5eA-over, anE others below that number were selected. The hon. -And learned member did not make tha-t 2ttenent 'n ignoranoe of what the circumtances really-wiere, because the' papers in'his possession showed why r. Trafford, the judge pf- the. Birmingham County Court (wrho 's Tho. -17 .on the list), had' had his salary incrased.. After- thei- fhr& Treasury minute was issued it 'was discovered- that mn conequence of the abolition. of two local courtz, hr. afford'sduties had been greatly -augmened Had that fact been knowni iit the.time his ame would have been included in the- first minute which assigned the nuzrimun salary. - The hon. and learned member further observed. that three other County Court judges had since -been. advanced to the highest salary-n-mely, Mr. Addison, Mr. Sergeant Dowling, and Mr. Dinsdale. But why? Sinme their appointment insolvency easeshad beenincludedin their duties, which in number had far exoeeded those-which hYAd come before any other of the County Court judts.9 The' insolrency cases disposed of in 1854 by Mr. Addison -were' 714; by Mr. Serjeaut Dowling, 294; and, by Mr. Dindale%, 123. lieferring to these facts, and to the amount of other' business performed by Mr. Addison and Mr. Serjeant. Dovwing, they were considered entitled to the olman'no salry of 1l an., nd, considering the extrabusinessdone by' Mr. Dinsdale, the Treasury assigned to him an inter-. mediate salary of 1,3501. The hon. and learned gentleman bad no excuse for making the charge on the ground of Xo. 16 having been passed over, because -several other numbers lower in the list were also passed over before arriving at thecircuits of Mr. Addison, Mr. Serjeant Dowling, and Mr.. D3insdale. The charge of personality, therefore, was entirelyuIfounded. With regard to Mr. Falconer, -he begged to say that he had never seen-that gentlemrn in his life, butt from All he (Mxr. Wilson) had heard, he believed him. to bea man in 'the highest degree efficient for discharging the dutien of a judge. Mr. Falconer had, lik-e others who felt nthemselres to have a claim to be paid at the mwxtimum, rate, made mauny applications to theTrary. In 1855 he made. a~ renewed application to be placed on the '771axim7um, scale, !urging as the ground of his appeal that the business of his. courthadmaterially increased. A Treasury minute was. passed on the 26d of FBebrury, 1855, the concluding passage of which was in these terms:- "y lords have given very careful consideration to thecLaims which, apart from any other special circumstances, have beenmade on account of increasing business. Mr lords are prepared to admit that this is an element which cannot in future be lost sight of, but that any increase ofthe kind which applies to only one, or even two years,. *6ild not be sufficient to justfy a change; and that, before in increace of the salary of any judge should take place on this ground, it should appear that the requisite increase of business to justify it has extended over an average x of at least the preceding three years." At the close of 1855 MEr. Falconer again apnplied to the Treasury, representing that his duties had stiUl further increased& during the p3eriod since his former application, and in January of this year that gentleman adesed a memorial tothe headaof the Government, to the Home-office, and to the Lords of the Treasury, calling attention tothe fact thathis business had continued materially to increase, and that. he thoughthe might be considered to come within the rule laid down by their lordships of having attained that average, of business for three years which would entitle him to be' put upon the maxim um salary. In 1849 the number of plaints in his court was 5,000, in 1855 they amounted to, 13,000. In 1849 the amount sued for was 7,0001., and in, 1855 it increased to 17,000. (so we understood). Previously to this memorial being received, he (Mr. Wilson} had made a memorandum to the effect that there were two. [courts which he thought might be raised to the maximunr saLary, one of which was the court of which Mr. Falconer was the judge. This at least show-ed-that there had been noc negligence on the part of the Treasuy as to what was going on w.ith rega-.d to these cour. When Mr. Falconer's memorial of January came before the Treasury it had been almost decided that his circult should be added to the list of those receiving the meximeumn salary, on the very ground on~ I which he hbimself put his claim-namely, that his duties had, upon an average of three years, come up to the podnt fixed by the Treasury minute. The hon. and learned gentleman. (Mr. Roebuck) had very frequently brought charges against the Government, and particuLarly agaimst himself (Mr. Wilson), for having excluded Mfr. Falconer from the' secximmn rate of salary on personal considerations. The hon. and learned gentleman had stated that, because Mr. lalconer was his brother-in-law, he had been precluded from receiving the ssexvlimluu2 salary of a County Court judge. When Parliament met this matterwas brought under discussion in ccnsequence of the Home- icchaving forwvarded to the Treasury a letter wbmch Mr. Falconer had addressed to Sir G. Grey. iBnt when the hon. and learned member for Sheffield put a notice on the books that he sbould move for leave to introduce a bil for revisng the salaries of the judges of the County Courts, and of fixig them at the u niform amount of 1,6001~. a-year; it vras impossible that the Government could proceed any further in the matter until that motion was diposed of. If the Government had given Mxr.rFalconerthe maximusalary they wo'uld have been open to the charge of having done so in consequence of the pending motion of the hon. and learned member, it having gone forth a fortnight befere that Mr. Falconer had been previously excluded from receiving that. salary because he was the brother-in-law of the hon. and learned member, and that the Government were anxious to. conciliate that hon. and learned geutleman. Under these. circumostances, the Governmnent tool; what they thought to' be the right course. They did not alter the intention which. they-had previously entertained; a minute was d-awn up ebodingthepuspose they had in view; hut the,y remain in a state of suspense unt the hon. and learned gentleman should have made his motion. Because, if the motion wrere lost the Government would still have the power to carry out its intention and assign to MIr. Fnlconer the maxim ma saary, and if it w ere adopted by the House, why, then, the Government would. only be compelled to do wrhat it had of its own will previously determined to do. When he (M£r. Vilson)spoke to. the hon. and learned gentleman respecting his intended. motion for leave to introduce a bill on this subject the hon. and learned rentleman told him that the Speaker had said that he could not bring it on. He (Mr. Wilson) replied that. he supposed the hon. and learned gentleman would have made a speech upon the subject; but, as he. could not bring on his motion, he (Mr. 'Wilsoni felt himself at liberty to say to himn that the Lords of the Treasury had passed a minute giving to Mr. Falconer the 2naximum salary, because they considered that he was entitled to it. Another reason why they gave him the mnaximum salary' was, that the duties of two local courts were about to he. added to his circuit. After having made such a communication to the hon. and learned gentleman-and it certainly would be a caution to him how he made a confidential communication again (hear, hear)-it was with the utmost surprise that he heard the speech of the hon. and. learned member, and it was with astonishment that he' listened to the charges which the hon. and learned gentleman had brought against him. The Treasury had been always governed by returns made by the proper authorities, and when the minute was made neither,his right hon. friend nor himself (Mr. Wilson) was aware of th'e names of any of the judges, with one exception, who would be affected by it, nor until the present agiwtation arose did he know that Mr. Falconer was a relative of the righthon. and leasnedmember. Hewouldjustmake one observation with respect to the case of Mr. Morris, inrelation. to which the Treasury had been charged with acting irreglarly. The simplecircumstances were, thatit being thought. better to have resident clerks for each of the five courts to which Mr. Mforris had acted as clerk, travelling with the judge, the Treasury proposed to give him compensation, with the privilege of appoiting the persons to act in his place. Mr. Falconer assented to that arrangement, which could only have been carried out with his sanction. However, within the last week it had come to the knowledge of the Treasury through Mr. Falconer, who would have done well to have communicated the' circumstance at an earlier period, that moneyhad passed between Mr. Morris and the different persons appointed in his place. That circumstance was now being inquired into, and he -would only add upon the present occasion that he hoped the hon. aud learned gentleman would not retain the idea that the Treasury had been influenced by personal motives in adopting the course which they had. (Hear, hear.) Sir J. PAKINIGTON did not propose to enter upon the personal differences between the hon. and learned gentleman who made the motion and the hon. gentleman who had just sat down. His more immediate object was to suggest to the hon. and learned gentleman the member for Sheffield whether, after the speech of the right hon. Secretary of State it would not be unnecessary to press the' motion to a division? (Cheers.) The speech of the hon and learned gentleman was very properly addressed to two, distinct branches of the question-one as to the propriety of equalizing the salaries of the judges, and the other as to. the amount at which they ought to be equalized. The first was, as he (Sir J. Pakington) believed, the more important of the two points, and the right hon. gentleman the Home Secretary had distinctly announced the intention of the Government to put an end to the difference which had hitherto existed, sand to withdiavr the inidious distinction now made betwveen some judges and other of their learned brethren. That was a conocession wisely made, and one that was much required. The Secretawy of the Treasury in his speech had dwelt upon the vanety and number of plaints, and the difficulty of deciding ipon the principle of distinction to be adopted. He (Sir J. Pakington)conceivedthere was uot onlv diffliculty in drawing such distinctions, but positive injustice ensued from them. He had taken the case of four judges who had been se:lected to receive the higher amount of 1,500! per annum, and had compared it with that of four other judces who had been excluded from that maximum salary. He found that while the four judges with the highest salary had sat in tho aggregate 522 days and 2,460 hours, the four judges not so, favoured had sat 671 days and 3,926 hours, and in many more different courts. That statement proved the injustice of the course which had been pursued by the Treasury. One, of the proudest boasts of this country was the high character for independence of its judges, but that independence would be jeopardized if the Treasury -were allowed to possess a poower of drawing distinctions and of exercising patronage cf such a nature. 'Upon those grounds he thought it Eessential that the present system should cease. With regard to the secondpoint-thc amount at which the salaries shouldbeequalized,-he would submit to the hon. and learned gentleman whether, in the present state of the question, it would be worth while to take a division upon that point ? As there was a bill before the other House having for its object tbe equalization of the salaries of County Court judges, but at the m.ininmzmw amount, he would subrit that it would be as well to wait until that measure came before them, when it would be competent for the House fto iniceise the amount to 1,5001., a step -which he was quite repared to take: (Hear, hear.) Ile would remind the GovernInent that in the original act there .was not onlv X rower to pay the judges by salaries instead of fees, but also. anindication of what those saaries should be in the -provi- sionthat theyshould not exceed 1,200l. per annum. At that gtime the judges 'were allowed to retain their privato practice, aprivilSese withdrawn in 1852, when thesalaries were increased to 1,2001. as a minimulm and 1,500?. as a. L maximm It had been stated that the Lord Chancellor

CIVIL SERVICE SUPEBAiYNUATION. This committee met yesterday in Room No. 12, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the chair. Dr. Farr said he bad been engaged since 1838 in the statistical department of the Registrar-General's-office. In conseqence of a request from the Committee of Civil Services e had made various inquiries into the question of the salaries and the abatements now made from them. The result of his inquiries was embodied in a paper read before the Statistical Society of London on the 18th of December, 1848, and the calculations were founded on returns furnished by the various departments. It appeared that there were altogether 16,353 officers liable to pay their contribution to the superanuation fund. The average nominal salary was 1411., nhich wasreduced by the abatementtol351. Two-thirds of these salaries didnot exceed 1001. From information of another kind it appeared that of these 16,353 officers 11,023 were married, and had on the whole 21,039 children under 15 years of age. These officers were unable to make any provision for their families by insuring their lives, owing to the abatement. Dr. Farr readfvarious returns, showing the bases on which his calculations were founded, and then explained to the committee his reasons for saying that the present mode of making the deductions from salaries was one fraught with great injustice. The object of the act, he believed, was to take from the salary of each public servant the exact amount which, on the principle of life assurance, would provide for their superannuation fund. Undet the present system this was not done, as the amount deducted was more than sufficient forsuch purpose, and it was considered an additional grievance that the sum so deducted fromn a part was applied to form a superannuation fund for all the public servants. By the CHAIXRM.u.-He certainly considered that it was the intention of the act of 1824 that the money deducted should be applied to the formation of a superannuation allowance for those who contributed to the fund. By Sir STAEForD NORT11CEr.-Does not the Treasury minute of 1829 contain the foHlowing:-" That deductions are to be made at the rates therein specified, for the purpose of providing, in such manner as nmy Lords may hereafter order, for superannuation on retirement of such persons as shaU hereafter enter the civil service '-Yes. And your argument goes to show that the present plan does not effect that purpose ?-Yes. Dr. Farr proceeded to explain several other tables, and said he had been unable to ascertain the principle upon which the amount of deduction had been fixed. He did not think that the remission of this special tax for the superannuation fund would be in effect an indiscriminate increase in the salaries of two-thirds of the civil servaats, without reference to the services or merit of the persons receiving it. It would be merely putting the civil servants entering since 1829 on a level with the civil servants who entered before 1829. He thought that the granting of superannuation allowances tended,to the efficiency ofthe civil service, although some were of a different opinion. Among the advantages of such an allowance might be enumerated the encouragement it afforded to faithful servants-the inducement held out to men to retire when they became old, and it also prevented the old servants from faUing into a state of disgraceful dependence. On these and other grounds he (Dr. Farr) would regret to see the system of superannuation abolished. After some questions from Sir F. BARING tending toshow that, in point of fact, the public paid the superannuation funud, and not the civil servants, Dr. Farr said that he believd the civil servants were induced to enter the service o i:to thi prospect of a superannuation allowance, although he did not know of any great difference in this respiect in those departments where such an allowance was not given. ltffhe committee adjourned until 12o@clock on Friday.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 1B6. The House of Lords re-amsembled from the adjournment for the recess yesterday. The Earl of MIALEsuui-Y, having deferred the quostion in expectation of hearing from the Government an announcement of - the conclusion of peacew, asked, the Marquis of LMNs:nowVir when the Eir of CLARENDON would return to London; till his return it would be inconvenient to bring on the motion relative to the fall of Rars. 'The Marquis of LkNisDowwn said, with -regard to the conclusion of peace, he could only state that with which the House was fully acquainted from the public prints; but he was ready to give any explanation that miglht be desired. He could not fix the day of the Earl of CLABn-DO-'s return. The orders of the day were then disposed of, 'and the House adjourned. In the House of Commons, Mr. ROEBUCK moved a resolution that an address bepresented to HRa MijESTY, praying HER MWEsrY to give directions to the Lords of the Treasury that hereafter the salaries paid to the County Court Judges should be equat in-amount, permanent, and not less than 1,5001. per annum. The object he had in view, he said, was really to improve the administration of justice; and he proceeded to show, first, the way in which business had accumulated upon the County Courts, which had now the greater part of the civil judicature of the coumtry upon their hands; and, secondly, the dependence of the Judges of those courts upon the Government, in being compelled to bow down to the Treasury Bench for an increase of their salaries from 1,2001. to the maxinmum of 1,500U. a-year. He appealed to facts which he considered furnished evidence that applications for an. advance of salary were decided upon, not with reference to the merit of the Judges, but to their connexions and Parliamentary iniluence. He asked the Houise to do away with the abuses to which the present mode of paying the County Coiut Judges w as liable, by fixing the amount of their salaries and making them permanent. Looking at the amount and at the quality of the buisiness disposed of by these Judges, 1,5001. a-year, he contended, was not too large a salary for them. '"here high qualifications were demanded they should be liberally paid for, and Judges especially should be not only above suspicion, but exempt from the, cares of the world and the anxieties of life. The motion was seconded by Lord SrTAYNsY, who insisted upon the impolicy as well as injustice of allowing the salaries of these Judges to fluctuate at the arbitrary discretion of the Treasury, which,. owing to the difficulty of fixing upon a sure test, was exposed to imputations of favouritism. Inorder to establish oneauniform rate it was indisDensable to raise those salaries which were below the present maximum to that amount. Sir G. GREY reviewed the course of legislation with reference to the salaries of the County Court Judges, observing that he thought it would have been better if from the first there had been one uniform rate of salary; but Parliament had been of a different opinion; it had established a mininuno and a maximuo m sum, and had imposed the duty of discrimination upon the Treasury. The Government felt that it was ill-judged economy to ' underpay Judges; but, at the same time, they had not deemed it consistent with their duty to the public to propose to raise salaries limited by Parliament and payable out of the Consolidated Fund; and he asked the House not hastily to pledge itself upon this question, but to wait until certain biUs came under its consideration, and until it was in fuller possession of all the facts. He moved the previous question. MIr. MoRRIs made a few remarks in explanation of a case adverted to by Mr. ROEBUCK. Mr. Wmsox, in defending himself against accusations brought against him personally by Mr. ROEBUCK, entered very folly into the grounds upon which the Treasury acted in increasing the salaries of County Court Judges. Sir J. PAKUoTOW suggested to Mr. RoBIciC whether, after the speech of Sir G. GRiEY, it was necessary to divide the House. The most important of the two questions to whichMIr. RoEBuck's speech was addressed was the expediency of equalizing the salaries of the County CourtJudges, and he was glad to hear from Sir G. GBEY that the Government approved their equalization. The other question related to the amount of the uniform salary, and if the motion was pressed to a division he should vote in favour of the salary proposed by Mr. ROEBCx. After a short explanation by Sir G. GREY, and some remarks in support of the motion by Sir G. PEoCnEI and Mr. Muims, Mr. GLADsToNE said it appeared to him that it mig-ht be a great question whether, on a reconstruction of the duties of the office of the County Court JJudges, with the addition of other functions, there ought not to be an alteration of their salaries; but, with the knowvledgo that fit men could be found to occupy that office, and who sought to occupy it, .at even 1,2001. a-year, it was a question which, in his opinion, ought to be kept open for discussion. Mr. DIsRAELI thought that in the state of our finances it would not be wise for the House to pledge itself as to the amount of salary to be paid .to any public servants. - Mr. ROEBUCK withdrew hiis motion. Mr. BouvEnIE moved for leave to bring in a biUl to amend the laws for the removal of poor persons, chargeable in England, who have been born in certain other parts of EHa MAJESTY's dominions. He described the process of removing Irish paupers from this country under the existing law,-a process which he characterized as most crael and unjust to the pauper himself, and most unjust to the district to which he was deported; and there was, he said, no practical appeal against the decision of the magistrates who ordered the removal of Scotch and Irish paupers. The remedy proposed by this bill, founded upon the report of the committee of last year, was that of assimilating the procedure with respect to Scotch and Irish paupers to that for the removal of English pauipers. By the arrangements in the bill he hoped that the cases of hardship and cruelty which occurred under the present law would not arise. Mr. W. WILLIAMS feared it would be perfectly impossible, owing to the difficulty of getting information from Irish paupers, to carry out the proposed arrangements. Mr. V. ScuLLY observed that the procedure under the English law of settlement was inapplicable to Ireland, where there was no suchl thing as a law of settlement. Sir WV. JOLLiFFE recommended that the bill should be referred to a Select Committee. Some observations having been made by MIr. FLoYER, MIr. BALrNES, Mir. KxGHT, and Mir. DE VErBE, leave was giveni to bring in the bill. Sir G. GREY, in moving for leave to introduce a bill for the better regulation of the corporation of the city of London, observed that the Government approached this subject with no unfriendly feeling towards that great body; their intention and object were not in any degree to diminish the importance or to lessen the dignity of the corporation; but by remedying defects in its constitution, or in the admiinistration of its affairs, to bring it more in harmony with the spirit of our municipal institutions, and to render it better adapted to fulfil its purposes. Sir GEORGE shortly described the present constitution of the corporation and the nature of its functions, and then proceeded to detail the provisions of the bill, which, he said, were foinded mainly, butnot entirely, upon the recommendations of the C5ommissionx of 1853. The general scope of these provisions was. to reform the constitution of the corporation (leaviag the main bodv, however, as it wvas), to abolish certain customs (including all privileges of trade in the city reserved to freemen, as well as riglhts of metage and street tolls), and to divest it of certain powers. With respect to the coal duties, the bill would not correspondwith the recommendation of the commissioners, who had proposed that these duties should be transferred to the hands of a metropolitan board of works; but the Government had come to the conclusion that the eightpenny and penny dut:es should be.allowed to expire, and that the fourp3nny duty should be kept alive only until the charges upon it had been paid off. The conservancy of the. Thames it was proposed to place under a Government board; the city police, wvhich the commissioners recommended should be incorporated with the metropolitan, it was intended to leave as it koir stood; and the bill departed likewise from the recommendation of the commissioners in. respect to the magisterial functions, of the aldernien. In conclusion, he expressed a hope that the result of this measure would be to give greater efficiency to the corporation of the city of London, that it would realize the expectations of the commissioners, and that these changes in its constitlution would augment its means of public usefulness. After some observationsby Sir J. DuEF, Mr. W. WmLuri;s, and Mr. MAxsEminiMA, leave was given to introduce the bill. The CH?ncEzToR of the7-xcHEQUER obtainedleave tobring in ;3 bill to continue for a limited period certain coipositions payable to bankers -who have ceased to issue banlmotes. The report of the Oomniittee of Supply waa brought up and agreed to. The Courts of Common Law (Ireland) Bill passed through committee. The House went into committee unon fire insurances, when, on the motion of the .CxciiELOP. of the ExcnEQIzu, a resolution was agreed to upon which to found a bill. The House adjourned at half-past 9 o'clock.
The long-expected measure for the reform of the Corporation of London presents itself at last in the mildest possible form. It was not without reason the civic Conservatives twenty years ago demandea a special consideration, for they have certairly obtained for the Coiporation of London a gentler treatment than feUl to the lot of its provincial compeers. These were so entirely newly constituted that identity was lost in the change, and a new body of men stepped in and assuimed the property and functions of the old. Not aI corporation but changed its members, its officers, the boundaries of its jurisdiction, its duties, and everything that can make a municipal body. Sir GEOIRGE GREY proposes to leave the boundaries of the city of London unchanged, and the mode of admission also the same as now. With the government of the body he interferes somewhat more. Of the three courts, the Court of Aldermen, the Court of Common Council, andthe Common Hall, made up of both, he gives power to the Court of Common Council, and takes it away from the Court of Aldermen. That this leaning will be popular with the more popular body, and contribute to the success of the measure, is likely enough, though one cannot help desiring that a body to be intrusted with larger powers should be better prepared and qualified for them. It is proposed to take from the Aldermen their right of nominating the candidates for the M ayoralty from their own body; to leave their magisterial powers, but to create some new police-courts, presided over by stipendiary magistrates, as in the rest of the metropoEs. Sir GEOoGE GREY does not propose to merge the city police in the metropolitan, notwithstanding the recommendation of the Commissioners, and the strong grounds of economy, as well as unity of action, that have been urged for this change. It is a matter of necessity that certain customs and privileges should be abolished. The right of opening a shop is no longer to be reserved to fieemen, and the rights of porterage, metage, and street tolls are to cease. It will be remembered that the Commissioners, whose report was made previous to the creation of the new Metropolitan Board of Works, with its taxing powers, proposed to hand over the coal duties, as long as they lasted, to that body, when it should be formed. Sir GEORGE GREY now proposes to let the penny and the eightpenny duties expire, andc to retain the fourpenny duty' in the present hands, -only, however, for the Equidation of existing charges upon it. The ancient conservancy of the Thames he proposes to transfer to a Government Board. Such a measure can only be regarded in the light of a compromise, and as such its present success, its working, and its -duration must depend upon circumstances. If the Reformers are content with it, and if the Conservatives, nowhere so numerous and so influential as in the city of London, are ready to compound for the measure, it will certainly remove some inconveniences and absurdities. The main absurdity, for such we must call it, is, however, untouched. It is absurd that in the heart of this metropolis there should be an imaginary boundarxn existing only in maps and the minds of officials and ratepayers, and without one particle of public utility in its favour, upon one side of which a man is a citizen and 1 on the other nothing at all, -without one iota of self-government. That distinction, it secns, is to be continued. The man on one side of a partywall may have a voice in the election of an Alderman or a Lord Mayor, and may himself aspire to those offices with a fair cliance, if he has only the personal qualities and a determination to address himself to the object; he may attain to important magisterial functions, to the management of a large body of police, to the control of an immense expenditure, and to the chance of numerous emoluments ad honours, which the genius of our ancestors certainly intended for the widest possible competition, not for a small section of London. It is true that the man who is so fortunate as to dwell inside the imaginary line has to pay for it in the shape of some high rates, and possibly, too, in a little misgovernment; for of the enormous wealth belonging to institutions in the city of London not much is diifused among that modest and independent class that will not ask for a share. Yet there is no denying-for it constitutes the very case against a substantial reform of the Corporation-that the man who dwells just inside a certain line to be found in the maps of the metropolis, though by no means in the metropolis itself, is decidedly better off in some considerable respects than his outlying but very near neighbour. This is still to be the case, though no sufficient reason has been assigned for it; nor has it yet been shown why the municipal rights so industriously retained for a portion of the metropolis should not be equally desirable for the rest. No doubt, the dignity and importance of the municipal offices would be vastly enVanced if the municipality were the whole of the metropolis, instead of a twentieth part of it or, at all events, if it comprised all that we commonly call London. Whoever, then, wishes the Corporation of London to be something worthy of the name must desire to have its boundaries extended. At the same time we are bound to admit that in so serious an affair, and in dealing with such various and intractable elements, it may be better to proceed by the tentative or experimental method. The MIetropolitan Board of Works, as at present constituted, is only an experiment, for it remains to be seen how far a popular assembly composed of the nominlees of a number of local democracies will conduct with wisdom, unanimity, and discretion even that lesser part of sosial government, the material works of the metropolis. It cannot be said that these representatives, though they may be considered by position the very glike of the metropolis, and must be supposed to have won their place by force of character and social qualities, have as yet worked together even so well as our representatives in' Parliament. They seem disposed generally to circumscribe their jurisdiction within the narrowest possible limits, instead of extending it .to the utmost limits of their charter. The general conviction formed on the riinds of enlightenedc observers by the constant iealousies and mutual obstruction of the newly-created metropolitan parliament is decidedly adverse to the credit of British citizens for local self-govermnent on a considerable scale. TIhat a few 101. househiolders and as many freemen. shotuld be able to manage . their wretched little affairs at least 'without scandal, if not with much profit, is thought likely enough ; but the example of the new Board of Works is now daily cited to showV; that. the middle-class Englishman wants the pressiure' of the class belowr and the guidance of that above in his administration of public affairs. Time alone will show whether this Board' will get over those difficulties of deliberation and co-operation which were noticed even in 'the British House of Commons fresh frrmi the ,Reforu Act. Bat, for the present, it ia natural to suppose that Sir GEORGE GREy does nLot think the Boa:rd of Works so successful an instance of self-government as to encourage ihii to a strong and a larg,e measure of municipal reform for the city of London. W,hen the new Board of Works has done its present work well, it will then be time to give it more to do.
- In an age. which is usually supposed to have been wanting in chivalrous. devotion to the position, and in a nation which did not pay extraordinary homage to the peculiar virtues of -the female sex, the genius of a great poet schemed the fiction of a Female Parliament. Of course, the outline once sketched was not difficult to fil up. Judges mindful of their fees rather than the justice of the cause they were to try-partisans forgetting tLe honour of their country in their spite to a virtuous politician or a distinguished commander-dema. gogues blustering on their own untried prowess, and threatening, if they had the opportunity, " to " do such things," shared the applause of the audience with the picture of husbands forgetting the claims of wife and home in the alluring sociey which tempted Socr=Zs not less than ALCaIBLDES, or in the celebration of those religious rites whi(ct probably made -the same impression on ths sinm;Ie minds of Athenian housewifes that we may suippose isproduced on theinnocent mcditat'ons cf modemn married ladies -when their husbands leave them to talk politics at " the club." But one element was wanting, if not iwo, that a modern imitator of AnisTorirAxs might supply in a sketch of a Female Legislature. Wife-beating, if we recoUect aright, is alluded to in the drama of the Attic artist; but probably it either was not so strongly developed a practice, or, if so, vas not so strongly condemned, as in cur day, for not much stress is laid on it. The Athenian tinker or cobbler may have knocked his wvife down with a ten-syllabled epithet, instead of having recourse t) the more material fashion of the monosyllabic London costerrionger. However tnis may have been, civilization has introduced a new gdievance for feminine indignation and masculine iemady; and this grievance is embodied in a petition addressed to "the Hon. the House of Commons "in Parliament assembled," bearing the signatures of sundry amiable, sensitive, and strongminded women, married and unmarried, of the United Kingdom, and intrusted to the cale or Sir ERSxLNE PERRY. We are at some loss how to express thlis grievance, for it begins with the admission of a state of things wlich we hardly ventured to hope existed. "We have been accustomed to Lear and record complaints on all sides that women have no profession, no employment, no means of earning a livelihood, except the various grades of domestic service, the calling of governesses, or millinery in some form. It appears from the "petition" to whicn we allude that, so far fiom this being the case, "modern civilization is indefi"nitely extenling the sphere of occupation for " women,"and that this extended sphere is amplifying their sources of income. Thus, at starting, it appears that, while women in the lower classes of society are earning wages as seamstresses, charwomen, cigar-moulders, and in other vocations far too numerous to detail, women in the higher classes are competing with men in the field and profits of literature. This admission is a pleasant hearing for the "friends of women," and doubtless wil have its due weight when the specific grievance of which the petitioners complain, and which we now come to, is considered. It amounts, in short, to this :-By the law of the land wives have no special property in their ovwn earnings, which are more the property of their husbands than of themselves, subject to their appropriation, and liable to their debts. This hardship and injustice, as the fair petitioners deem, it, they call on the Hon. the Commons of England to repair by a more jnst and liberal legislation. _ To a petition signed as this is, and dictated by the feelings which animate its subscribers, we would willingly pay the utmost deference, and, if possible, give the utmost support. But vie confe3s that we don't clearly see our way to the end proposed by any legislative measure. Indeed, such remedy as might be devised the petitioners have cut away from under their ovn feet. They wish to create a separate proprietorship in favour of maarried woomen, and in the same breath denounce the " cumbrous machinery of trusteeslhip," whlici. wvas intended to effect, and generally does effect, so far as any plan can, the very result which they wish to attain. WVe confess -we hardly see how they will improve upon the existing system so far as regards the objects which it contemplates, or how they will obtain its benefits for other objects which it does not contemplate, save by imitating its provisions. The fact is, disguise it how you will, or select whatever number of exceptional cases a diligent scrutiny w,ill supply, the existing state of things is the result not of human legislation, but of nature's laws. The relations of the sexes may be extemally adorned with all the trappings of artificial manners and luxurious civilization, still, as fw.Ad they are essentially the same in all ages of the world. Womankind in the mass are, and must be, for all material advantages, for protection and personal security, dependent upon men, wlhether the latter be styled " lords and masters," or " tyrants and despots ;" and in no relation is this dependence on one side, and protection on the other, more marked, more real, or more natural than in that of marriage. The whole character of this union would be lost, most of its purposes defeated, if auy law interfered to change this mutual relation, and to substitute an express recognition of theoretical independence and equality in favour of the wife. As it is, the law, while it confers superior authority on the man, attaches to him duities and responsibilities which insure the tranquillity and comfort of the wife. And it is curious to observe that the connexion of the husband's privileges and responsibilities is so strikingly close that these-petitioners, even when they would enlarge the freedom of the wife's action, are forced to admit the propriety of limiting the husband's liability at the same time. This, in fact, illustrates the whole question. Marriage is a compact of niutuality. The powers of the husband over the wife's means are great, because his liabilities for his wife's maintenance and credit are also great. He is in the eye of the law the proprietor of her income, the receiver of her rents, the controller of her fortune, because he is accountable for the payment of her milliner, her servants, her coach-hire, to say nothing of her children's keep and education. " Do awayr -with this jus proprieatis," say the petitioners; and in a spirit of fairness they add, " do away " with the unlimited liability also." This is the ultimate solution of the question. What these ladies would see become a fruit of statute law is nothing else than the cohabitation of male and female, each with separate fortumes, separate expenses, separate bills, separate liabilities-the husband going to gaol while his wife is riding in her carriage-the -wife hurried off by bailiffs while the husband is eating venison and drinking champagne ! -Such is the theory they propose. Bat is there the most distant prospect of its ever taking a practical shape, were its enactment provided-by the most stringent of codes ? From such an a pprehension we are, saved by a placid regard of wbat have ever been and ever will be tho conditions of
Two bills have lately been introduced into Parliament,-the one affecting the property, the other affecting the lives of British subjects, and no principles can be more diametrically opposed than those on *which the two bills are founded. The Joint-stock Companies Bill of MIr. Lown goes upon the assumption that no legislative precaution can secure the public from mercantile fraud, and that no authoritative registration can take the place of individual sagacity and responsibility. The bledicad Bill of Mr. IEADLAM3, which stands for Committee this day, goes upon the assumiption that legislative interference can secure the proficiency of medical practitioners, and that Government registration may, in a general way, take the place of individual judgment. That the principle which is sound in the former case may be inapplicable to the latter *ill be evident, if it is considered that, wvhile it is impossible to insure the solvency of a company either no w or hereafter, it is not difficult to insure the proficiency of an individual, and, proficiency once attained, it is not liable to be lost, like the fortunes of a company. But, granting this much in favour of the general object of MIr. PnA.AtaM's bill, it must be admitted that there is no object which it is more difficult to obtain vwithout an attendant train of e-vils at least as great in magnitudeas those which now exist while the object is unattained. If one may judge from the expectations of the medical journals, there is a good time coming for theprofession, when all quacks shall cease to exist, and when there shall be no heretics, and when the fees of the medicineman shall be determined by law even as the tithes of the clergy. Happy days these may be for the regular practitioner, but we conceive that both for the interests of science and for the interests of the public nothing could be more intolerable than any law which should tend to establish a medical despotism in the country. Let the quacls go to perdition, let PARies life pills be given as a piunishment to convicts, let Moiuusox's pills be given as a dessert to vegetarians, let HonowA&Vs ointment and TowxsEs-D's sarsaparilla be sold for manure, let the village bonesetter find his occupation gone, let the village blacksmith draw no more teeth with his pincers, let the itinerant herbalist be regarded as a vagrant, and the itinerant mesmerist as worse than a vagrant ; that is all very well, but we know that not even among Doctors of Divinity have there been such fierce discussions as among Doctors of MIeclicine, that the standard of orthodoxy is not more high in the church than in the dissecting-room, and that the medical profession is apt to brand as an alien and a heretic every member, however distinguished, who deviates in principle or in practice from the current notions of the day. WVe have ou-selves no predilection for honmoopathy, but it is impossible to deny that, especially on the Continent, persons not defectively educated at times adopt that method of cure; and there is at least one good effect which the system has wrought-it has taught the general practitioner to drug his patient less, and to trust more to the vis medicatrix uaturce. The homceopathists may be quite wrong, but would it be right to say that their difference of opinion is necessarily a proof of incompetence? And yet at least one University has treated assent to the dogmas of homceopathy as equivalent to a want of education, and has refused its degree to a candidate who had gone through his curriculum of study with distinction, I and passed his final exaiination with honoiur, simply because, through some private source, it was discovered that this undergraduate was inclined to believe in RAIINhLSi. Were this disposition manifested by all the other Universities of the kingdom, as sooner or later it would be under the tutelage of such a Medical Council of Education as ar. HTmiD3Am proposes, what would become of that freedom of opinion which is the vital air of science, and which *io doubly necessary to the most uncertain of all the sciences ? It is only natural that the physicians, surgeons, and general practitioners should desire to have diplomas entitling theni to practise throughout the British empire, in Lonclon as in Edinburgh, and in Diblin as in the diocess of Canterbury; but even the present system, with .all its faults and inconveniences, by which a graduate of the University of London nima not practise in the metropolis without a diploma from the Royal College of Physicians, or without a license from the Company of Apothecaries, would be preferable to enactments which, giving the duly educatedl me(ical man freedom to practise in every village in the iunited kingdom, should denjy him the freedoim to tlinkand to practise in his own way. Yr. REtDLAV'S bill, however, concerns the public even more intimately than it does the profession. The establishment of a Council of Edulcation that in -effect wotuld render the medical profession a elose corporation, while it might entail mucl harm to science, might bring much lucre to its followers; but to the public it wouild be productive of little else 'than evil. It is proposed. that the Council, which is to legislate on all matters that regard medical educalion, ihbill consist of 24 members, two-thirds of whom are to be elected by the several Universities and Colle?ges wthich now grant degrees and diplomas, the remaining third to. be elected as representative members by the general body of registered practitioners throughout the united lkingdom. Each of the Schools of Medicine snds its deIegate, and all the medical interests send their representatives, as if, to quote the words of a correspondent, " the primary object were to guard certain internal interests of the profession, as "if some common property had to be admi"nistered-some property vested jointly in "medical corporations and- practitioners, over "the application of which they. all might "rightfully claim to watcl, interest against in"terest, so that none should steal an unfair "advantage from the trust." Now, with all the eirors whichl Mr. HrAnnTAm has committed in his conception of this Council we are not going at present to meddle; but, however ill-advised or well-advised it may be in its details, in its general idea nothing can be worse for the public. The medical profession is at present honourably distinguished by the intellectual activity of its members; their posts are anything but sinecures ; they are foremost in every good work ; and perhaps it requires some little imagination to conceive what would become of it under the stagnant influences of a Cotuncil of its own members venerable with age and hardened in opinion. It is quite possible that the dissenting doctor who is banned from the society of his orthodox; brothers may in that case be more wortly of the public confidence than the recognized physician, and that all the requirements and restrictions, degrees and licenses, appointed by the Council may be much more than a mockery, a delusion, and a snare; they may become an intolerable nuisance, which it would be impossible to sweep away without years of agitation, without bills innumerable, and, to crowrn all, without heavy compensation for interference with vested rights. What a priestridden country is we know. We do not yet know what is a physician-ridden country, unless we may judge from the fearful despotism of the niedicineman of savage tribes, and we may be pretty sure that the despotism of a close institution like that proposed by Mr. HEADLAar would in the end conle to be as oppressive and as absurd.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. We have received the Moniteur of yesterday. It publishes the following- "The Minister of State waitedyesterday (March 31) upon the Senate and upon the Legislative Corps to make a com. munnication in the name of the Emperor. " At 4 o'clock the Minister was introduced into the hall of the Senate with the usual ceremonial, and read the following message:- "'Messieurs les SUnateurs,-I come, by order of the Emperor, to announce to you that yesterday, at 1 o'clock, the Plenipotentiaries of France, of Austria, of Great Britain, of Prussia, of Russia, of Sardinia, and of Turkey affixed their signatures to the treaty which puts an end to the present war, and wvhich, in settling the Eastern question, places the peace of Europe upon a solid and durable basis. "'The exchange of ratifications will take place at Paris in four weeks' time, or earlier, if possible. " ' In bringing this news to your knowledge the Emperor charges sue to thank you for the patriotic support you have given him throughout, and which, with the admirable devotion of the allied arnies and fleets, has so powerfully contributed to the happy issue of the war.'

FORBIGN INTRLLIGBENZOE. FRANCF, . trFEO OuR OWN 003 =5PONDXNT.) -[The following appeared in our second edition of yestar.ifv *-1 - PARIS, MOn2±vYF zcHoK3l, 6 P.:Z In my letter of yesterday I mentioned that immediately after the signing of the Treaty of Peace at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the Plenipotentiaries proceeded to the Palace of the Tuileries, to comMuiilcate the important fact to the Emperor in person. His Majesty received theminthe Salon des Ambassadeurs, attended by the officersof hishousehold. lVhen the news was announced the Emperor is said to have expressed his thanks to the Plenipotentiaries for having come in person to him with such agreeable tidings. He observed that the result of their labours duringr' the conferences was the complete realization of the speech delivered by Lord Clarendon in the House of Lords, and that the peace which the allies were determined on concluding was one whichcarried with it no humiliation to Russia. and which did not compromise the dignity or independence of any one; it was, in fact, such as a great nation might propose or accept without degradation, and - it therefore had all the elements of solidity and durability; and he added, that so favourable a result was, in a great measure, owing to the conciliatory spirit and moderation which marked the policy of England, and which was particularly felt in the coiirse of the present conferences. I cannot affirm that these ivere the exact words, but I believe that they are substintially correct. I have already mentioned that the protocols will not be made public until the official news be received of the ratification of the treaty at Constantinople and St. Petersburg, and it is calculated that this cannot be before a month, making every allowvance for wind and weather. The Congress will not separate for some time yet. There are other questions pending which still possess paramotunt interest, and it would not be proper for the Plenipotentiaries to leave Paris without taking them irto consideration. The Congress represents the great Powers of Europe; the eyes of all Europe are directed to its deliberations, and the opinion most generally expressed is, that their work would be imperfect if they quitted the capital, when peace with Russia has been just signed, withouit showing that they had not forgotten or disregarded other matters which have a strong claim to their attention. What the special subjects are which will be brou,ght before them it is not in my power to say, and I am equally ignorant of the time that it will be necessaryto devote to them. ThePlenipotentiaries will resume their labours on Wednesday next. I understand that Lord Clarendon has no intention, as stated, of quitting Paris for the moment. There can be no pressing necessity for his presence in London, and it is quite clear that the Treaty of Peace, and the papes connected with it, cannot be laid before Parliament until the exchange of ratifications takes place. The conclusion of peace has been received here with the greatest satisfaction, and the iRluminations and other manifestations of that feeling were, I believe, throughout spontaneous. They may not have been so general as on the birth of the Imperial Prince, but people were not so prepared for it as for the other event. The day was beautiful, many were in the country, and, though the rumour circulated on Saturday that al had been concluded, or very nearly so, yet until the cannon of the Invalides announced that all was over fewv beleved it certain. Some thought that on Monday the treaty would be signed, and many supposed that the first announcement would be made by the Emperor himself at the review to-morrow. The houses along the Boulevards and some of the principal streets are stiU decorated with flags, among which here and there the Russian colours are mingled. We have already learned by the telegraph how the news has been received in London. I believe I am not in the slightest degree mistaken when I state that the best feeling prevails here among all classes, and ahlost all parties, at the conduct of England throughout. No one knows better than this people that if there ever was a time when England was prepared to carry on war with vigour, and with all the elements of success, it is the present; that her army is in courage, disciplne, experience, and resources such as it has seldom been, and that her maritime force is unexampled, even in her own history. They know, too, now that passion has calmed down, that England has not entered into the present, or rather late war, for selfish motives, and that she was prepared to continue it, not out of any inordinate love for war, any more than for any projects of ambition, but to obtain an honourable peace, which, as the Emperor very properly said, does not infict humiliation on anyone,while it secures for a long period the tranquillity of Europe and the independence of everyEuropean state. They know too that the feeling which influenced England was a far purer and a higher one than the vain longing for military glory; and that, while they are proud of having drawn the sword in a just and noble cause, they are wise enough to know when that cause is saved, and moderate enough to be content with having saved it. When, after all, one reflects for a moment on all that Russia once demanded, and all that she has now given up, the peace that has just been concluded can hardly be pronounced other than glorious in its results; and on a calm consideration of all that. has occurred since the British and French flags first floated in the EuiLre the man must, in my opinion at least, be unreasonable indeed if he be dissatisfied. Here it is not anticipated that such will be the case, but that in England, as in France, the peace that has been concluded will be found honouirable for all concerned, and, because honourable, satisfactory. The following are some particulars relative to the important act of signing the treaty of peace - " The draught of the general treaty of peace drawn up by the Comit6 de R6daction having, in the sitting of Saturday, obtainedthe sanction of the Con,,ress, the Plenipotentiariesof the contracting Powers met the next day, as already stated. to proceed to the formal act of affixing their signatures to the document. M. Feuillet de Conches, chief of the protocol department in the MIinistry of Foreign Affairs, had caused seven copies of ,the treaty, written on parchment, to be prepared and placed on the table of the corferences, in such a manner that each copy was put before the Plenipotentiaries of the Government by which it is to be ratified. After the text of the seven copies had been carefully compared, thb Plenipotentiaries proceeded to affix their signa. tures to the end of the treaty. Count Walewski, as President of the Congress, signed first, and the other Plenipotentiaries in the alphabetical order of their respective countries. It was at this moment that the Emperor was informed by electric telegraph that the treaty of peace was signed, and His Majesty sent back word to the members of the Congress that he would be ready to receive them after they had concluded their task. But, although the mere act of affixing their signatures occupied the Plenipotentiaries but a very brief portion of time, the whole of the formality of signing lasted nearly two hours, as the Plenipotentiaries, in addition to their signatures at the bottom of each protocol, had to affix their initials to the different paragraphs, the whole number of such minor signatures being, it is said, 38. The Plenipotentiaries of each contracting Power signed first the copy reserved for their Government, and then the other Plenipotentiaries signed in alphabetical order. In this manner, each contracting Power figuring at the head of the signatures of the copy which it is to ratify, all difficulties as to etiquette or precedency were set aside. To each signature was immediately attached th3 private seal of each Plenipotentiary. Immediately after the close of the sitting all the Plenipotentiaries went together to the Tuileries, where they had tho honour of being received by the Emperor. Cabinet couriers were sent off in the evening to London, Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Turin, and Constanxtinople, in order to submit the treaty for the ratification of their respective Courts." A Berne letter states - " Orders have been received from England to suspend the enrolment in Switzerland for the British Foreiga Legion. The operations of recruiting are in full activity. 20D men were sent to the depot during the last week." The Patie says "We have been informed, that in order to accelerate as much as possible the taovements of the vessels which are to convey back to France thepersonneZ and nw&eriel of our army in the East, Admiral Trehouar' is to remain at Kariesch with the line-of-battle-ship Bretagne; Rear-Admiral Odet-Pellion is to proceed to Constantinople; RearAdmiral Penaud, now on his way from Brest to Tonlon, will repair to Malta, where he is to hoist his flag on board the Palinure; and Captain Darrican is to be appointed superior Commander of the Prench Navy at Messina. Finally, RearAdmiral Boue-WVtlanmez has been instructed to send to Mile, in tle anme capacity, one of the offiers orf- tho station. on the Greek cosat." The following private telegraphic despatches hlae been received "BERIEN, .&RoC 30, EvxNMG. " ae news of peace, published this evening, has pro. duced an extraordinarysensation. From Russia we learn that the Grand Dulces Constantine and licholas, and General Todtleben, accompany the Emperor Alexander on his iourney to Finland. - AXH <3 31.- "On the occasion of the signature of, the Treaty of Peace the King has conferred on M. de Manteuffel the Grsnd Cordon of the Order of the Black Eagle. X. Esterhazy, the Austrian Minister, is dangerously ill of an inflammation of the lungs. The account of the intended visit of the Erapress Dowager of Russia to Germany next mnonth is confirmed." " TURIN, 30TH, EVEN-MG. ' Salutes of artillery have announced at Turin, Alexan. dria, and Genoa the news of the conclusion of peace." "KEE4 IARCH 30. "The Firefly corvette has arrived here from Farosund. She is bound to England, with pressing despatches for the Admiralty from Cominodore Watson. " The English gunboat Cuckoo has entered the Baltic, and others are expected to-morrow." "TRIESTE, MAtc2 So. "Letters from Alexandria of the 23d stato that tho Viceioy has received orders to again place the Egyptian troops in Turkish uniform, and to demolish the forts of Alexandria." Count Orloff and his military suite, have been invited by the Emperor to accompany His Majesty, onhorseback, to the grand review which is to take place to-morrow in th'e'Champ de Mars. The same invitation has beenaddressedto somesuperior officers of Austria, who have just arrived in Paris on a special nission from their Government. The re-establishment of peace is expected to impart great activity to the Parisian trade. In anticipation of that event the shopkeepershave been laying in for the last month extensive and varied stocks of spring and summer articles they hope to dispose of advantageously during the approaching fetes, whicl the city is to give in honour of the christening of the Imperial Prince and of the conclusion of peace. The Bank of France, on the other hand,viill, it is believed, immediately reduce its rate of discolunt. Cash is again beginning to flow into theceoffers of that establishment, nnd the cessation of hostilities in the east will necessarily render available for industrial and commercial purposes the large sunis of money which last year had to be forwarded to the Criiea to supply the wants of the army. The manufactories of millinery andnouvedaues are busily at work, but those of fancy goods, bronze articles, and jewelry, are still in the dull season. The price of raw materials continuing to rise, manufacturers are obliged to increase that of their goods, which is a serious drawback on their sale, particularly for exportation. The advance amounts for certain articles to from 20 to 25 per cent. The Government has not yet adjudicated the Transatlantic lines. The commission appointed to report upon the different offers has however terminated - its labours, and it is probable that the question will be decided in the course of the present month. The .downward movement in the corn-market, which commenced towards the middle of January, is daily making new progress. Business in Paris has been extremely staanant during the week. The best sorts of flour, which on Wednesday fetched 89f. and 89f. 50c. per sack of 157 kIlogrammes, sold on Saturday for 88f. The stock remaining in the Halie on that day was 32,412 metrical quintals. The sale of wheat was even more difficult than that of flour. The decline is general in all the provincial markets. The average price of wheat, which on the 29th February last was 30f. 40c., for the entire of France, was 29f. 40c. on the 15th MIarch, being a diminution of one franc. A telegraphic despatch from Marseilles announces that 160,000 hectolitres of wheat had been shipped for that port in the kingdom of Naples. The appearance of the crops in the ground is still most promiising. The cattle markets are abundantly supplied and rates remain unchanged. At Bercy the wine trade has resumed some activity in consequence of demands fromParis. Prices, however, maintained themselves with difficulty, owving to advices from -the wine districts stating that the general tendency was downward. Montpelier is quoted at 160f, per hectolitre, and spirits extracted from beet may be had at 95f. and 96f. The following notice was posted up to-day at the Bourse:- " The Council-General of the Bank- of France, at its sitting of this day, reduced from 6 to o per cent. the rate of discount on commercial bills and advances on public securities and railway shares. That reduction is to take place from the 1st April. . " The Secretary-General, VILE. sIaris, Muanch 31, 1856."

LuCKY CAPMRE.-In July last Aaron Marks and Nathan Salamian, merchauts, of Sheffield and Australia, were adjudicated baukrupts in the Leeds District Court of Bankruptcy. Marks surrendered, but Salaman, being in Australia, did not appear. By the overland mail the assignees of the bankrupts were apprised that Salaman had taken his passage in the Emma, for England, which arrived in this port on WVednesday last. The Leeds District Court inmediatoly forwvarded a warrant to Mr. L. T. Gaskill, the messenger of this district, intimating that the bankrupt had considerabIe property on board, which the assignees were an.xious to secure for the benefit of the credTitors. Mr. Gaskill immediately placed persons on the look-out for the Emma, then expected daily. In the meantime the Lightning arrived three days before the Emma; and, although the,messenger had no instructions to look after the Lightning, he considered it might be as well to inspect the hst of passengers by that vssel, and in so doing he found that the person whose property he wished to seize was a passenger in her, the bankrupt having changed his intention in Australia with respect to the ship in which he took his passage, andthus the assignees were driven on the wrong scent: aLving ascertained this fact, the messenger immediately procoeded to the Custom-house depot at tho Nelson Dock, where he found that the bankrupt had cleared his luggage, and had gone no one knewv where. After searchinlg the different hotels about the docks and elsewhere, he ultimately found that the bankrupt had stayed for a shorttime at the Victoria HIotel, near the station in Lime-street, and had aftervards proceeded by the quarter-past 5 train, taking with him seven packages, supposed to be valuable. At the station the messenger discovered nine packages belonging to the bankrupt, which were to be forwarded to him at Sheffield. These were seized by the messenger, who instantly telegraphed to the Leeds messengers, announcing the bankrupt's whereabouts. The consequence was that about the same time the bankrapt arrived in Sheffield he was met face to face by the Leeds messenger, who, after the usual polite salutation, relieved the bankrupt of the care of the seven valuable packages. bIfr. Gaskill, suspecting that the bankrupt might have some goods on freight in the Lightning, made an investigation, and succeeded in stopping 290 ounees of golddust, valued at about 1,2001. This package, however, was shipped in the name of Solomon Nathan (the bankrupt's name being Nathan Salaman). It was, however, shown that the dust was stated in the manifest tobe the property of a passenger on board, and there was no such passenger as Solomon Nathan, or any other person of a similar name but the bankrupt. Shortly, however, after the seizure, two Jews made their appearance at Messrs. Baines's, one representing himself as Solomon Nathan, and the other as one of the passengers on board the Lightning. Solomon Nathan claimed the dust as his property, and produced the bill of lading for it, stating that it had been sent to him from Australia, and it was his friend, the Jew passenger, then with him, to whom the dust was supposed to belong. The messenger expressed to Mr. Solomon Nathan his surprise, under the circumstances, that the dust was not entered in his friend's name, and it appeared strange that if diust of that value was consigned to him (Nathan),2 ho could not produce a letter of advice, for the bankrupt (if. the gold was the bankrupt's) could easily have handed over the bill of lading to any person. However, under all the circumstances, he (the messenger), by virtue of his warrant, should request Messrs. Baines to detain the dust until an investigation was made, and if the dust was really his (Nathan's), le could apply to the Leeds Court of Bankruptcy for its release. -The two Jew gentlemen then took their departure for Sheffield, where they are said to reside. An investigation into the circumstances took place on Saturday, before Mr. Payne, the registrar at Sheffield, the result of which Tre arenot acquainted with. We consider that great praise is due to Mr. Gaskill, for the activity and shrewdness he has displayed in this matter, and we are glad to hear that he has received the thanks of the Leeds officials.-Lizrcrpoot paper.
THE UiIZD STATs. (RX OUR OWN -CO=WPSIDXqT.) : SEW YORK, MARCH 17. I am assured fromWashington that the project of arbitrating- the differences -between Great Britain and this country does not find favour with the Gb'vemment. Mr. Buchanan, as you will- have observed, placed his opposition to arbitration upon the ground that " there is nothing to arbitrate." If the offer of arbitration should be declined,, it will be for reasons which are thus put forth by the Washington correspondent of the ANew York Eve.nin3 Pos:-. " L That we have so clear i nght to insist on the withdrawal of Great Britain from any portion of Central America that no tunprejudiced rind can deny it ; and that an indisputable right is not a fit subject for arbitration. Illustration-no one subraits the queston of his property in the coat on his back, which he has paid for at the tior's, to the-decision of a referee. If we accede to the proposition, it will imply & doubt as to the justice of our claims under the treaty. "2. 1Neither party, if dis-atisfied, would submit to the avard of the arbitrator, as past experience has shown. " 3. There is no leadin- Power whose selection would be satisfactory to both pTties. Russia and Prussia are the only European monarchs before whomi the United States' Government will submit its case, andneither of them would be acceptable to Great Britain. "4. The only case ever submitted to the arbitration of a foreign Power by. this Government, bearing a likeness to the presen t, wvas decided to the dissatisfaction of both perties, and not accepted. This was the decision by the Sing of the lNetherldand, January 10, 1831, on the .North-E astern Boundary,-a question subsequently decided in the treaty 6f 1842 by Webster and Ashburton." Mr. Benton is said to have suggested the propriety of tossing up to settle the meaning of the treaty. I am inclined to think that such a way of determining it would be in harmony with the magnitude both of this question and the enlistment affair. The Government is troubled by private letters informing it of a union of the four Central Amnerican States against Walker. This propigator of civilization at the bayonet's point has lately unwisely exposed himself by annulling the charter of the Transit Company and by the annexation of Mosquitia to Nicaragua. The annulling of the charter has an under-history which does not appear in the public prints. There have long been two rival lines to California -one by way of Nicaragua, the other by way of Panama. Rivalryand low fares have eaten away the profits of these concerns till no dividends are left. At last the Panama people, who were the richer of the two, bought up enough of the stock of the other company to control it, and turned out some of the old people.' They had been friemds of Walker in his hour of need; he now reciprocates the favour. It is said here that England is ready to assist the confederacy against Walker by money and military aid, and complaint is made that the interests of this country in Central America have been put in jeopardy by Walker's movements. Four treaties have ben successively negotiated with Central America by this Government (without being ratified) aU very favourable to the United States. But it is now said that the course pursued by Walker has alienated from the United States the sympathy of the Spanish population, and that Great Britain can make better terms with them than the United States can. You can judge of the correctness of these views quite as well as we in America. I am assured that Walker has already made heavy exactions upon the country. A friend 'writes me, "in some cases he'has taken as much as $12,000, giving Government bonds in return. This makes them interested in the stability of his r6givie with a vengeance." The Admiinistration apprehend that the report of an intention on the part of Great Britain and France to increase their fleets is true, and that a portion of their armies will also be sent to Nicaragua. French and Sardinian merchanits residing at Nicaragua have applied for the interposition of their Govermment in their behalf, to procure restitution from Walker of the money and goods exacted from them for the support of his Government. This Government says very properly that it has no right to prevent such an interposition. Apropos of such demands, a friend vwrites me,- "I know myself an American merchant from Granada, who is about to file a silnilar request in the Stato Department, to get back $3,000, due to him for goods taken by the new Government, for which he received a written acknowledgment of indebtedness. He applied to 31inister P. H. Trench, then at the St. Nicholas, with the money desk of the Republic in his possession, but could not obtain payment." The $3,000,000 Bill, for increasing and improving the supply of small arms, is under discussion in the Senate. It will probably pass that body and fail in the'Eouse, which is hostile to the Administration, and is not disposed to put that sum at its disposaL The bill for the modification of the tariff is under consideration, and will probably be introduced in a few days. A curious constitutional question has been raised in the Senate by Dir. Sumner, of Massachusetts. The notice to abrogate the Sound Dues-Treaty was given without the concurrence of the House of Representatives. The Republicans claim that the assent of that body is necessary to give validity to the notice, and are supported in this by some of the most respectable authorities in the Senate. The President entertains no doubt of the power of the Executive to give the notice without the approval of either branch of Congress. The Republicans, onthe other hand, say that the manner in which the treaty with Denmark has been terminated is a dangerous encroachment of the Senate, especially as the Tower House is so strongly in the opposition. If the Executive has this power, then the t:eaty binding this Government to maintain the African squadron, the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and other sinilar treaties, can be abrogated by the Executive alone, and the country brought into war, or to the verge of it, without the assent of the popular branch. Mr. Sumners resolation of inquiry has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The payment of $7,710,000 to Texan creditors will put a good deal of money in circulation in June next. Under the advertisement offering for $1,500,000, the Secretary of the Treasury has bought $794,871; nearly $500,000 is from foreig-n holders. He will probably get all he wants before the 1st of June. The balance outstanding onl the loan of 1846 on the 5th of March was $89S,';3, which is redeemable in IN!ovember next, and will be paid then. The United States' debt will be much reduced by this Andministration.
LNco.E-mX .RrF'omi.-On Mlonday night a public meeting was held at the Shire-hall at Glocester, upon requisition to the Mayor, to consider the subject of the reform of the income-tax. Themayor, Mr. Cliffe, took the chair, and on the platform were Mr. Price, M.P. for Glocester, and Messrs. Attwood and Partridge, a deputation from the Birmingham hicome-tax Reform Association. The Mayor, in opening the business of. the evening, alluded to the receipt of the news of peace that day, and was followed by Mr. Price, M.P., in a short speech. The members of the deputation followed, Mr. Attwood admitting that perfection could not be hoped to be attained in this matter, but much improvement might be effected. He suggested that a similar principle should be-adopted in levying this tax as was laid down in levying the Customs. If parties declared their goods liable to Customs at a price below their actual valuation, the Customs had the power to take to those goods at the owvner's valuation; and he suggested that if parties set down their incomes or property below their actiial value the law should have the power of taking the surplus. 'While the war lasted there might be some reason for the argument 'hat nothing ought to done to peril the position of the Mlinistry;* but now that happily the war was over lie would upset any Iinistry that refused to come to a proper adjustment of the tax. Mr-. A ttwood quoted largely from some Parliamentary bluebooks, and alluded to a letter in a recent number of She Tizner, signed by "d. Sufferer under Schedule D." 'Mr. Partridge, honorary secretary to the Birmingham Income-tax Refoun Association, -addressed himself to the iniquity of the present system of adjustment of precarious industrial income on an equality with income derived from the funds or other fixed sources. He was for tunming off any Ministry that refused to enter upon a readjustment. He proposed the levying of a simple property-tax on the'%aggregate amount of all property, as in America, and `proceeded to show that such a tax would raise moriv than the present inequitable income-tax. Mr. S. Bowly approved of this plan and moved :-" That the present income-tax is oppressive and unjust, because unequal, and, fromi-the nature of the assessments, inquisitorial, and that an equitable adjustment or total abolition of the tax is necessary.!' This was carried by acclamation, and Mr. T. IL Sturge propibed the adoption of a petition to the House of Commons in echo to the resolution. He spoke of the effect of the hax upon the commercial morality of the kingdom, and said BE- knew iof his own personal experienoe-that persons who were insolvent bad, "in order to Lkeep nb their credit," returned their incomes at many times more th'an the-actnal amount. He congratulated his fellow-citizens on the return of peace once more, and said only a short time ago he feared he should leave the world involved in war; libt-Jie trusted, now that peace was restored, it would continuevs long as their last peace had lasted. The petition -aIS adopted; and, on the motim of Alderman u eane, a memorial to the Chancellor of tbe Exchequer was carried, setting forth the tax as unjust aned inquisitorial, and praying for its abolition - orre-adjustent.

COVENT-GARDEN THEATZE. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-At the late meeting of the shareholders of Coventgarden Theatre MIr. Surman, on the part of the proprietors, is reported to have designated me as a " good tenant." In the letter you did me the honour to insert in your impression of yesterday I had not the slightest intention to jeopardize that good opnion, nor for one moment to impngn Mr. Surman's veracity; I merely said I thought Mr. Surman's meaning must have been misunderstoodL Pray forgive me for again intruding on your space; but I wi be as brief as possible, relying that any of your readers who may'have taken the troublo to peruse Mr. Surman's accouuts will easily umderstand my few figures. As to the discrepancy between the sum of 30,000!. and 34,0007., that arises from Mr. Surman having excluded the year 1850, because, I suppose, I was then only joint lessee with several of the ar istee, he dating his calculation from 1851, when I became sole lessee. Mr. Surman, in his letter, says, "When Mr. Gye wroto that he only owed 2001. on the 31st of December, he knew that the acceptance of C. for 4401. was not paid." Far,from this being the case, I at the time believed that it had been paid, and, moreover, I have been this afternoon most positively informed that it was paid, and more than two months ago. The acceptance was one given to me by a librarian, and by me to Mr. Surman. My authority for its having been paid is the principal manager of the librarian's business. I therefore can most positively repeat that since I have been the lessee of Covent-garden Theatre I have paid the proprietors more than 34,0001. rent, and that on December 31st I did not owe them (even allowing 3tr. Surmans; figurestobe correct) morethan 2101. MLr. Surman ends his letter by hoping he had made it clear that he was correct in asserting that at the time of the shareholders mbeting M3r. Gye owed 1,700t. I never denied it, and I am not in the least ashamed to acknowledge that I am now three months' rent in arrear on a total sum of 34,000D., and that inan opera speeslation wherein I have had an expenditure of 12,0001. per month to provide for. But in 3r. Surman's letter of to-day be further says I owehim 7501., reserved for season 1854, and 1531. 5s. 4d., arrearS to be received. As to the 7501, it is a sum payable to the proprietors only in case of my receiving a certain amount of money due to> me, there being no liability on my part, unless I do receive it. As to the 1531. Bs. 4d., I presume that is the proprietors' share (or one-seventh) of subscriptions to the Opera stil unpaid, on seasons when they took one-seventh of the receipts in lieu of rent. Taking Mr. Surmah's figures to be correct, there must be due on those seasons 1,072 17s. 4a., and I might just as well say that the proprietors owe me sixsevenths, or 9191. 12s., of that sum, as Mr. Surmaa that I owe them one-seventh, or 1531. 5s. 4d. Your readers, Sir, must, I am sure, suppose that there has been some serious dispute or quarrel between the proprietors and myself on reading such an unkind letter as that from their solicitor, and>no doubt they will be surprised to hear that nothing of the sort has ever occurred, but that I have always been on friendly terms with them, particularly with Mr. Surman. From Mr. Surman's sarcastic suiggestion. as to my giving anu order on the insurance-offloe it would be imagined that he had made some sort of application to me for rent since the calamitous fire, but such is not the case,a circumstance whi6h I naturally attributed to a considerat. feeling onthepart of a landlord tow-ards a "goodtenani:" In fact, having been in Paris for some tinie, I have not saen Mr. Surman sbince the meeting of proprietors alluded to, and only once for afew minutes since the fire; but I could scarcely imagine the letter in your paper of to-day to b3 writtten by himself, or by the authority of the proprietora of Covent-garden Theatre,-it is so incorrect, s ungeneroaR;1 and so uncalled-for. I remain. Sir. vour most obedient servan._ FREDERICK CTTh Lyoeum Theatre, April 1.
'NMOBRY-.ALK.T and CITYINTELLIGENCE. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about-4 yer me premium according to the last tariff), whein, -at-the 3nglih Iint price of 31. 17s. 1d. per oz. for atsndard gold, gives an exchange of 25.27; and, the exchange at Paris on London at short bemg 25.37jV, it follows that gold is about 0.41 per cent. deaxer in London than in Pans. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold i! 4264 per mark, which, at the English 31int price of 31. 17s. lOid. peroz. for standard gold, gives an exchange of 13.5k; and, the exchange at lamburg on London at short being 13.n, it follows that gold is 0.87 per cent. deaxer in london than in Hamburg. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is about 109- per cent., and, the par of exchange between Ingland and America being 109 23-40 per cent., it follows that the exchange is nominally about at par; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and dfference of interest, the present rate leaves scarcely any profit on the importation of gold from the United States. The English funds opened steadily this morning at the improved prices of yesterday, and were steadily maintained to the close, notwithstanding the occurrence of a further heavy fall on the Paris Bourse. Consols for money ranged during the day between 93 and 93j, and the final prices were 93 toX for money and 93k to E for the 10th inst. For the 8th of May the transactions were at 93i to i, but after regular hours ;.r,ie bargains were effected at a decline of an eighth. Consol Scrip left off at 3k premiunm; New Three per Cents. were quoted 93j to j ex. dividend; India Bonds, Uls. to 6s. discount; Exchequer Bonds, 08k to s; and Exchequer-bills (March) is. to 4s. premium; (June), 2s. discount to par. In the early part of the day there was a great pressure for money in the Stock-Exchange, but the demand subsided in the afternoon. At the Bank of England the applications were not numerous. In foreign securities the principal circumstance 'Was a further considerable advance in Turkish Six per Cents. They closed yesterday at 100, and the transactiens to-day wereat 1O00' andlOl formoney, and 1001, 101-, and I for te account, the final quotation being 101k to -. The Guaranteed Four per Cents. were markedcl i0I for money and 102k and s for the account. The other operations comnprised-Chilian Six per Cents., 101; Danish Three per Cents., 84 and 841 ; Mexican, for the account, 2O ; Russian Five per Cents., 105X; ditto, Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 94 and 94i; Sardinian, 94X for money, and 954 and 95 for the account; Spamish, for the account, 46, 46k, 45-k; ditto, Deferred, 25j i; ditto, Passive, 7;: Venezuela, Deferred, 13; bnutch Tvwo-and-a-Half per Cents., M3k; and Dutch Four per Cents., 94r. I. the forcign exchanges this afternoon long bils upon Paris were more in demand, owing to the reduction in the rate of discount there. Amsterdam was a shade lower, but othermise there wvas no altoration from last post. The closing quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening show another decline of five-eighths per cent., the Three per Cents. having fallen to 72f. lac. for money and 72f. 25c. for the account. The rush of persons eager to realize has been very great, and the depression would have been much more considerable if the Bank of France had not come to the a: sstance of the speculators yesterday, by lowering its rate of discount. The rate paid for carrying transactions in Rentes over to the next account, at the end of the month, is stated to have ranged from 15 to 1S per cent. The specie brought by La Plata to-day was 5G5,CGOl., including 80,000l. in gold. The amount -of gold by the Baltic is 160,0001., a considerable portion of wvhich will remain mn this country. The Board of Trade returns for the month ending the 29th of February were issued this morning, and furnish proof of extraordinary actiity in all departments of trade consequent upon the approach of peace. In the declared value of our exportations there is the extraordinary increase of 2,693,3311., the total for the corresponding month of last year having been one of the mot unfavomable during the war. This increase is spread without exception through every branch of industry, but metals and dhe yarns of cotton, linen, and wool have experiemced the most conspicuous improvemeat, inconsequence of the demand occasioned by the growth of confidence among continental manufacturers. The revival in the Australian trade seems to be indicated by an augmentation in the shipments of haberdashery, hardware, and leather. Annexed is a -table, showing the exact increase or decrease under each head:- DECLARED VALUE OF MExrorAP.Tros. Witlh regard to imported commodities there is no material alteration on the average, the consumption of some articles presenting a considerable increase, while in others there has been as large a decrease. VWheat, floLr, and rice have arrived in augmented quantities. Coffee, wine, and tobacco figure for an increase. Of tea the cons-umption shows a diminut on, although the importations have been extremely heavy. Sugar, spirits, fruits, and spices are likewise on the unfavourable side. Subjoined are the quantities of provisions, &c., imported and taken for home consumDtion :_ The following are the comparative imports and exports of raw material, showing a large increase ia cotton and wool:- generally been large. Dyes and dyeing stuffs, metals, oils, and seeds, have all arrived in great quantities. Eides exhibit a decrease. In the imports of timber there has been a falling off of lBritis4, and an increase of foreign, and the consumption of both presents a large diminution. The commercial .accouwts from New York this week describe a. tendency to improvement. in the stock-market. Erie Railway.: was quoted -561; Panama, 105:j; Reading,. 9X; and Illinois' Central Bonds, 90. Large transaetionai continued to take place in N[icaragua Transit: Stock,j and the-excitenent respecting. it was undiminished; but there-had been-no material resedion .from.the recent fall, the last quotation being 13k. It was still uncertain whether the United States' Government would interfere forcibly against General Walker and his band, and meanwhile the vessels of the company had ceased running from New York. The whole traffle was therefore for the time thrown on the Panama route, and the stoclk of that company had conse. quently become iirmer. According to the last reports from Nicaragua,Walkerls power was threatened by quarrels among his followers, and it was believed that any adverse demonstration on the part of. the United States' authorities would at once cause his fall. There were also reports of hostile movements against him by the surrounding States; but there wouldbe little danger from this cause if he were able to rely on his ow n men. The following is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders - ' The committee have received advices from Mr. Whitehead, dated Mexico the 3d ult. Congress was installed on the 18th of February last, and confirmed the nomination of General Comonfort as 'President substitute.' Xis Excelleny the Mrinister of Finance writes that a Government force of 10,000 is be.sieing Puebla, which is expected soon to surrender. l'he p3acet bringas $45,000 from Vera Cruz, 12,401 from T.ampaco, and $13,584 from Mazatlan, for the dividend fund."

Robert Barbour and Brother:- "There hasbeen a steady demand for the staples of this market during the past month, and spinners and manufacturers who were under contract have had Ettle dificulty in selling their production at better rates than those current in February. The business done has been of a general character, both for the home and foreign narkets. Prices, however, .are unsatisfactory, and to many mostunremunerative, as is evinced by the numerous failures of small manufacturers and compromises with their creditors which do not come before the public, and it is only capitalists with mills on the best principle who can keep their position. The difficulty appears to be that the nmill power is in advance of the supply of the raw material, and the necessity which exists for keeping spinning and manufacturing machinery employed when once created causes too great a competition, not only in the demand for cotton, but also in the disposalof the yar and goods. The announcement of peace has given a slght stimulus to the market ; but, as the demand has never been directly interfered with by the war, and the signature of the treaty having been anticipated, it is probable that no material effect will be produced,beyond the gradual and general improvement wfhich is ex-pected to take place in the trade of the country." _______ ______

In other articles a moderate trade only has been done, at about late rates. Market hides remain without alteration.
THE CORN TRADE. T.TlTrPPAAT. A--m. 1 The arrivas3 from Ireland and co;stwise during the past week have been smnal From foreign ports, however, we have received 15,453 quarters of wheat, 3,800 quarters of beans, 350 quarters of peas, 31,237 quarter of India.n com, and45,006 barrels of flour. The exports in the same time comprise 581 quarters of wheat. 1.660 quartersof oats, 4.657 quarters of Indian corn, 798 sacks and 1,737 barrels of flour. There has been a fair retail business doing in the trade during the past wveek, and, vith few exceptions, prices of all articles have been fairly supported. Peace appears to have been fully discounted in the corn-market. The weetber continues extremely fine, vith easterly winds, and frost at night. At this day's market there was a good attendance of the town and country trade and some buyers from a distance, who, no doubt, expected to find prices much depressed by the news of peace; but holders showing no disposition to give way, ultimately a good business for consumption was done in wheat and flour at the full prices of Tuesday last, being an advance, however, of 2d. to 3d. per 701b. and 6d. to ls. per sack and barrel on soine low sales made during the week. Oats and oatmueal vere in improved request,but without change in value. Barley, beans, nud peas, with a moderate retail demand, remained as Inst quoted. There were few samples of 3idiancom offering, the late arrival being for the most part not yet sampled, so needy buyers had to pay 30s. 6d. per quarter for prime northem mixed, 3Is. for yellow, and 31s. 6d. per quarter for prime white.

STATE OF TRADE. 45 MANCHIESTER, APRIL 1. An improvement has taken place in the market to-day, and a good deal of excitement has manifested itself among -manufacturers, who are generaly asking higher pniees. Selers report that this advance has not been rnr=!nded to verywellon the part of buyers. Shirtings and all kinds of India cloths are in rather brisk demand, and the only difficulty is as to price. The advance asked by manufacturers is lVd. or piece. Longeloths remain unchanged. On the whole there is a healthy feeling in the market. In yarns thero has not been much doing by shippers, but the home trade buyers have been active, and an advance basbeen secured of Ad. to id. per lb. on cops and warps. The spinners of bundle yarn, for export, are asldng id. per lb. higher, but are not realizing it. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:- " The improved feeling noted in our last report continued througheut the week, and, with the exception of longcloths and domestics, which were dull of sale, a steady business w-as done at gradualy hardening prices. Yesterday and today, in conseqjuence of the long and anxiously desired news of thse termination of the war, a general advance has been askd by manufacturers, which, howvever, has in only very few; inlstances been conceded, and the business of the day is consequently on a very small scale." The montlhly circular of Messrs. Robert Preeland and Brother will also be read with interest at this juncture:- "At the date of our last monthly circular, sellers had succeeded in maintaining their advanced position, though supported only by a feeble demand in the latter part of February. An active business for India and China was then just beginning to show itself, nor did it slacken till prices of shirtingshad sprung 3d. per piece, and production suitable for those markets had been engaged for some weeksforward. " The home trade demand has also been active, as is usual at this season, which has assisted the market materiaUy. But during the last fortnight there has been less doing; prices however continue ffim, and seUers are in good spirits. Indeed, from the news to band this mornig of the treaty of peace being signed, there is a disposition to hold for extravagant rates. The telegraphie accounts from the East by Trieste are also looked upon as being more satisfactory for the manufactures of this district. But it is questionable whether buyers wil readily follow any upward movement, for we are now approachig that period of the year when demand falls off for several mark;ets, and, with large arrivals of cotton which may shortly be exrpected, manufacturers m-lay probably put on fresh contracts, wgithout much advance in price. "The expnorts of cotton piece goods and yarns for the month are 86,114 packages agaist 68,563 for the same time last year, but rather under the averagae for the last previous three mouths, which is 91,879 palckages. The followving classification shows at a glance the proportion to the various markets: Packages Lb. Cotton Cotton Piece Goods. Yarns.

"MuleTwist.-Our quotations for the lower qualities are fully 'id. per lb. higher, and say from 70's and upwards there is a general advance of lid. per lb., which has been caused more by the anticipation of peace than by actual business, although there has been a great amount of business done. "In water twist the advance is about Ad. to d. perlb. "The goods market is in a* healthy state, the demand throughout the month having been of a very general character. 39-inch shirtings, forIndia and China, are 3d. to 4d. per piece higher;- 45-inch ditto, 3d. per piece. Madapollans 3d. per piece of 46 yards. T cloths, longeloths, and domestics, without alteration. Jaconots, from being quite neglected, have sprung up from lAd. to 3d. per piece." LEEDS, APRIL L The cloth-halls have been well attended to-day, and a good deal of business has been done at fully as good prices as those of last week. The news of the signing of the peace treaty has had no perceptible effect upon the market. The report of this day's fluddersfleld market is as follows :-" We have bad a fair trade, but not equal to the average of the past few weeks. There is a reluctanoe to give advced prices. Stocks are very light. Bayers were in the market from London and Manchester, but few large, sales were effected. In wool a good business was done. Prices arQ firm and stocks low."
SuCIDE AT AMtPTON-COurT PALACm.-An inquest was held (on Tuesday, 1st of April) before Mr. William Thomas Manning,- coroner of Her Majesty's household.and the verge, and a jury- of yeomen oficers of the Queen's Household, at the eanteen, Hampton-coulrt Palace barracks,o'n the body of MIr. Jsmes N~eil, late superintendent of Hampton-court Palace gardens; which office he had held about'four years, having been appointed by Lord Seymour, at the time he was Chief Commissioner of the Woods .andForests. It appeared- from the evidence of Wiliam Hurst and Hannah Cox that about 10 o'elock on Sunday last the deceased was found lying on the pavement a few feet from i 1he front door of bis -apartments in the Palace profusely bleedingat the head, aadaportion of one ofthe tiles fromthe roof byhis side. Deceasedwasonlypartiallydressd, andim-. mediately hewas taken up he expired. The evidence showed, that he must have clambered through a window on the roof: of his apartiments, and then precipitated himself down a' beighto upwardsof.30feetontothestonepavementoeneath.- It appeared that the deceased was of a very exeitablo and iiritable temperament, and that he had beenin the habit £me months since of firing off guns andpistols in the courtyard of the Palace late at night. On-being iemonsthated with on one occasion by' the witness Hurst for his extraor. dinary eonduct, he replied. "Don't be alarmed, it's onl - me." Dr. Jepson, the -medical attendant of the dece -, deposed that he had been in the habit of attending him for ftofdsesia for about nine months, and that he wras undemedeaPtreatment for about a week previous -to his death. On the Fniday preceding his decease witness was sent for suddenly,when he found deceased in bedwith-notbing ap parentli the matter with- him, -but he complained of t depression. He was of opinion that deceased destroyed'Lim self while labouring nder an attaek of hypochondria Witness- did not think- that a p,ost mortem emination would tend to further elucidate the cause of death. The coroner and jury having viewed the spot where the eatas.- trophe occurred, a verdict of "temporary insanity" was: returned.

'he report of the directors of this company states that during the past hWlf-year the works on the line between Ketley and Xorsehay had been prosecuted with as mnuch anergyas teh funds in hand -would *dniit and #tipr expected that the line to }orsebay irculdI be opened for tiffic in about four months. The directors regretted that, owing to the-Want of funds, they were unable to commence the 'Works between-Horsehay and Coalbrookdalo, as that portion of the line, when coinpleted, would insure a large traffic over the railway. The accounts showed that 17,889L. bad been received and 16,1181. exsTended, leaving a balanoe of 1,771.. An additional subscription of 10,0004 would enable them to complete the line to Coalbrookdale, and it was expected that the sequisite amount would be subscribed by WATERFORD AhND TRAMORE. The half-yearly nieeting of this company was held on Saturday at Dablin, Sir J. Dornbrain in the chair. The secretary read the report, which stated that the traffic receipts showed a gradual increase. The revenue for the half-year ending the 31st of December last showedithat 3,2601. had been received for passeNjgers, and 1354. for goods, while at the corresponding period of 1854 the receipts for passengers amounted to 3,068., and for goods to 76., showing an increase of 1927. in the receipts for passengers, ind 771. for goods, together 2691., or nearly 9 per cent,! Owrg to the outstanding debt due by the company to the contractor, the directors found it necesry to make a call of 21. lOs per share, which was due in January last, and the produce had enabled them to pay off a considerable amount of that liability. -Out of the available susplusfrom revenue the directors recommend a dividend of 4s. per-share, leaving 418. for the next account. The CnAsiR-AS moved the adoption of the report, and in replytoquestions stated that the liabilities of the company aniounteclto 1S,5631., of which]2,00!. was due to Mr. Dargan, The last call npon the shareholders had produced 7,3084s, of which 5,63Bl. was paid to Mr.ra.D Mrr. DxsAA?G2 seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, and it was carried. Sir J. Dombrain, one of the retiring directors, was reelected, and Mr. Dargan was elected a director in the room of Mr. M1ackbe, who retired by rotation. A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings. IRISH SOUTH-EASTERN. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at the office in Dublin on Monday. The chair was taken by Mr. J. E. Redmond. From the directors' report it appeared that the amount of trffic-for the six months ending the 31st of December last wasq 7,094., being an increase of VO3 on the corresponding half-year of 1854. The available surplus from the traffic of the half-year am ounted to 3,039l., out of which the directors recommended a dividend of 2s. Gd. per share, subject to income-ta, tobepaid to theproprietors, and thatthe sum of 3007. be placed to the credit of a depreciation fund, leaving a balance of 396. to be carried to the next account. The directors state that the sum of 2,0001. charged for law costs is in full settlement of all transactions with their solicitors to the 30th of June last. Viewing the increased traffic of the line, thodirectors have resolved to resume their remuneration from the 30th of June last, which in March, 1852, owing to the then depressed circumnstances of the cornpany, they voluntarily for a time declined to accept. After considerable discussion the report was adopted, and the proceedings terminated. - ; j;AGENALSTGWN AN)D WEXFORD The half-yearly 3meeting was held on Monday at the company's office, in Dublin. Mr. J. E. Redmond, chairman, presided. The directors! report stated that proceedings had been talken under the recent act of Parlfament to obtain possess'on of the lands required by the contractor twithout unnecessary delay; and accordingly Mr. Joseph lFishbourne, the arbitrator -appointed by the Board of Works, held several meetings at Borris to receive and decide upon the claims of the occupiers and other parties interested, and in several cases made awards,which were at once accepted, and thus enabled the company to enter into possession of a cons'derable extent of land. The Portion of the line which will connert -the Irish South-Eastern Railway with the section already in progress will be shortly placed in the hands of the contractor, it being highly desirable that the works should be pushed on, so as to enable the line betweenl Bagenalstown and Borris to he opened at as early a peried as practicable. On the motion of the Chairman, the report and accounts were unanimously adopted, and the retiring directors and auditor were re-elected. The meeting then separated. COM3ITTE:E ON RAILWAY BI1;IS.

DEATH OF HI{ - XCELL E7AY SIR CHARiES -HOTHAML (From the Metbourrne Argla.) It is with very sincere sorrow that we have to announca -the decease of his Excellency SirCharlesflotham, Governor -of this colony, who died at Toorak yesterday (Jin. 31) about a quarter past I o'clock. - Weu uderstandthat Sir Charles was seized with a very severe attdack of choleraic diarrhuas on the morning of Saturday, the 22d of December. Dr. WCrea, the colonial 44reon, WM Called in, an4d hii -Xcelleney'a cmpb!nt yielded rspidly to the medical treatment thatw s adopted, though it left him very much debilitated. So far, indeed, did he recover that on the following Monday he was able to -leave his room, and during that and the two sucoeediiag days he appeared'to be regaining his usual health. Sir Charles Hotham was a man of an exceedingly excitable temperament, and, whatever may be thought of his sucoess in the management of public affairs, he w&s deeply anxious about them. Durint his whole illness hs was greatly interested in the Ainisteridal crisis which was then pending. On. Thursday Mr. Nicholson had an interview with his Excellency on public business, and shortly after that gentleman's departure his Excellency complained of headache, and a nervous irritability soon became percep. tible. On Ssturday Sir Charles received a message from Mr. Nilcholson through Dr. M'Crea, to the effect that he (Mr. Nicholson) hai abandoned the attempt to form a Ministry. After the receipt of this message the Governor became decidedly worse, seroas irritation of the brain having developed itself. Through the whole of Saturday night tae symptoms of the disease were becoming more and more alarus3ing, until, on Sunday morning, at 3 o'clock, he was suddenly seized with- an attack of epilepsy. Another fis came on athalf-past4 o'clock a.m.. and the fits continued to follow each other at intervals of half an hour until about 11 cilock in the forenoon of yesterday, when he became comatose, vith heavy stertorous breathing, in w hichstze he continued until a quarter past 1 o'clock p.m., when he EEs Exccellencylhad never previously been subject to epileptic fits, and his medical attendants attribute the attack to the very severe strain upon the mental vowers that Sir Charles had undergone during the period of-his government of the colony, superadded to a violent cold which he had caught on the occasion of his attending the lightin- of the first fire at the Gaswvorks. This occurred on Mon&ay the 17th ult., when a violent storm of wind aud rain came on, to which his Excellency was exposed for a somewhat protracted period On the Thursday following Sir Chirles felt indisposed, and mentioned to his medical adviser, Dr. M'Crea, that he thought he had eaten somnething that h,d disagreed w;ith him. Hie had taken a little fruit, his ordinar diet being exceedin3gly simple. Sir Charles wvas sensible in the forenoon of Sunday, during the intervals between the fits, but was unable to articulate at that time. He was aftervwards under the influence of morphine, administered for his relief, until the fatal symptoms showed themselves. His Excellency was attended at first by Dr. M'Crea, the colonia2 surgeon, who, when the epileptic fits came on, called in Drs. Barker and Motherwell, by whom his Excellency was assiduously attended until the hour of his death. It may be interesting at the present moment to republish the memoir of the late Governor which appeared last year in the Statistical Reister of Victoria, compiled by Mr. W. A. Archer, assistant-registrar of this colony, and we accordingly subjoin it:- " Sir Charles Hotham, LC.B., born in 1806. is eldest son of the Rev. Francis Hothaim, Prebendary of Rochester (socond son of the second Lard Hotham, one of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer), by Anne Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Thomas HlaUett Hodges, of Hameted-place, Kent, and first cousin of Captain the Hon. George Frederick Hotham, R.N. Sir Charles, Who is brother-in-law of Lieutenant-Colonel Grieve, of the 75th Regiment, has also a brother, Augustas Thomas Hotham, in the army. "This officer entered the navy on the 6th of November, 1818; and on the night of the 2Sd of May, 1824, when midshipmani of the Naiad, 46, Captain the Hon. Robart Civendis Spencer, served in the boats under Lieutenant Mi-chael Quin at the gallant destraction of a 16-gan brig, moored in a position of extraordinary strength alongside the walls of the fortress of Bona, in which was a garrison of aboat 400 soldiers, who, from cannon and musket, kept up a tremendons fire, almost perpendicularly, on the deckL He was made Lieutenant on the 17th of September, 1825, into the Revenge, 76, flagship of Sir Harry Bnrrard Neale, in tt e Mediterranean; and next appointed-the 15th of May, 1826-to the Medina, 20, Captains Timothy Curtis and William Burnaby Greene, on the same station, and on the 8th of Deoember, 1827, and the 26th of July, 182S, as First, to the Terror and Meteor bombs. Captains William Fletcher and David Hope. As a reward for his distingaished exer'. tions on the occasion of the wreek of the Terror MIr. Hotham was promoted by the Lord High Admiral to tl:e rank of Commander on the 13th of August, 1828. After an interval of half-pay he obtained an appointment, on the 17th of March, 1830, to the Cordelia, 10, and retmuned to the Mediterranean, whence he ultimately came honme, and was paid off in October, 1833, having been raised to the post rank on the 28th of the preceding June, in compliment to the memory of his uncle, ti.e late Vice-Admiral Hon. Sir Henry Hotham, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. His next appointment was, 25th November, 1842, to the Gorgon steam sloop, stationed on the southeast coast of America. In November, 1845, having assumed command of a smal squadron, he ascendedtheriverParan-, in conjunction with a French naval force under Ca j3iv Trehouart, and on the 20th of tha' month, after a Ulrd day's fighting, succeeded in effecting the destruction of four heavy battenles belonging to General Rosas, at Pnnta Obligado, also of a schooner of war carrying six guns, and of 24 vessels chained across the river. Towards the close of t' e action he landed vith 180 seamen and 145 marines, and accomplished the defeat of the enemy, whose numbers bad orignally consisted of at least 3,500 men, in cavalry, infantry, and artillery, and whose batteries had mountecd 22 pieces of ordnance, including 10 brass guns, which latter were taken off to the ships, the remaider being all dcstroyed. The loss of the British in this very brilliant affair amounted to 9 men killed and 24 wounded. In acknowledgment of the gallantry, zeal, and abili y displayed throughout its varions details by Ca, - tain ffotlmm he was recommended in the mo t ferventterms of admiration by his Commander-in-Chic', Rear-Admiral Samael Hood Inglefield, in his despatches o the Admiralty, and he was in consequence nominated a E.C.B. on the 9th of 3March, 1846. In May in that year he was employed as Commodore on the coast of Africa, with his broad pendant successively flying in the Devastation and Penelope steamers. His subsequent distingaished diplomatic services are so well known as to require no comment. "On the 3d of December, 1853, Her Majesty was pleased to appoint Sir Charles Hotham Lieutenant-Governor of th s colony. His Excellency and Lady Hotham arrived in Hobson's Bay on the 21st of June, 18 The following day Le was escorted from Sandridge to the Government-officep, MSIelbourne, in much state, amid the acclamations of the assembled thousands, who lined all thoroughfares." In addition to the above we may mention that shortly after his appointment to the government of Victoria h s Excellency was married to Jane Sarah, third daughter *f Samuel Hood, Baron Bridport, by his wife Charlotte Mary only daughter of the Hon. and Rev. William first Ear. Nelson, who was raised to the dignity of Earl in acknowvledgment of the services of his brother, the great Lord NeYson. Lady Hotham had been previously married to the late Hugh Holbech, of Farnborough, Warwickshire. The somewhat unexpected event of his Excellency's deceaso created a profound impression yesterdav. The performances at the various places of amusement were put oft, and the grand ball for the benefit of theBenevolent Asylum was indefinitely postponed. The funeral, in accordance with a general wish, 'will be a public one, and will take place on Thursday. We arc informed that the intention is that a procession shall be formed at Prince's-bridge at 8 a.m., to proceed thence to the Newi Cemetery The succession to the Government of Victoria is regualated by the following clause in the Commission recently issued in favour of the late Goiernor - "And in the event of.the death or absence of you, thesaid Sir Charles Rotham, out of our said colony of Victoria, we do hereby provide and declare our pleasure to be that all and evory the powers and authorities herein grantedto you shall be, and the same are hereby vested iu such person as i may be appointed by us, by warrant, under our sign-manual and signet, to be the Lieutenant-Governor of our said colony, orin such person or persons as may be appointed by us in like manner to administer the government s such contingency; or, in the event of there being no person or persoLs within our said colony so commissioned and appointed by us as aforesaid, then our pleasure is, and we do hereby provide and declare, that in any such contingency all the powers and authorities herbin granted to you shall be, and the same arehereby grhnted touthe xniormilitary officerfor the time being; and such Lieutenant-Governor or such person or persons as aforesaid, or such military officer, as the case may be, shall exercise all and every the powers and authorities herein granted until our further pleasure shall be signified therein." In terms of the above provision the chief authority devolves upon Major-General Edward Macarthur, Commander of the Forces in this province, who yesterday asumed the government, and under his direction a supplement to the Govermment Gazxe was issued announcing the decease ofhis predecessor. Iajor-General MTacarthur is a member of the well6kInowm Macarthur family, so long and so intimately connected -with the adjacent colony of New South Vales. He is the eldestson of Captain 31acarthur, the celebrated introducer of the 'mermo sheep. and the brother of Messrs. Wiiam and- James MIacarthur, of Camden, who have long been before the public, taking an active part inpublic affairs asmembers of the Legvislature and as enthusiastic and skldful develoocrs of theresourcesof the landoftheirbirth. Amost interest ing letter from the former of these gentlemen upon the subject of the Australian wines exhibited at Pans appeared last week in these columns, and illustrated strongly the zeal with which colonial advancement is urged on bythat enterprising gentleman. Manjor-General Macarhur seitered-the' armyi,n very early life, and has seen considerable xrvice in the Peninsula and seLwhlere. He has not the character for being possssed of great ability, and is understood to be of high Conservative predilections; but as a native of Australia he may, at all events, be expected to possess that most valuable quality for a leadingman-some colonial experience, and we may well hope that he also possesses a mnowledge of our wants and a disposition to supply them. Tho new- year opens somewhat portentously upon colony without a Governor .and without a Ministry; but to doubt the acting Governor will be sufficiently guided by thssigns of the times to follow up the introduction of rewoni ble govermnient now somewhat stormily inaugurate, andt to talke up the negotiations in reference to the formxtion of a 3inistry pretty nearly v'here Sir Charles Hotham left them. It is the beauty of the constitutional system of go- vernrent to render nations less dependent upon the acidents of individual existence and the peculiarities of indi. vidual character; aid therefore, although we commence the year with a deceased Governor and a disbanded liinistry, there is no reason to fear that the public interests WiM in any wyy be se,riosly jeopardized,

The increase in the deaths registered in the Last week of March over those registered in the beginning of the month, when the number in a week was abouit 1, 10iJ, is not caused by an increased rate of mortality, but arisei from more than a due proportion of coroners' cases being entered in tle register-books at the end of the quarter. la the preeent table 5 deaths are referred to intemperance. S to poison, 27 to burns and scalds, 6 to hanging, 10 to suffucation, 26 to drowning, 35 to fractures, 7 to wounlds and other injury, and 40 are placed to sudden deaths. The deabts classed nnder these heads constitute a great majority of the cases en which inquests are held. Of 228 deaths produced by the zyinotic or epidemic class of diseases 65 were caused by typhus and coULIon fever, =.nich cases occurred chiefly in the eastern ;nd southern divisions; 51 by-whooping-cough, 28 by scarlatinia, 23 by measles, 13 bv smallpox, and only 4 by diarrhuea. Phthisis ws fatal in 141 cases, of which 29 occurred to persons under 20 years of age, 61 between 20 and 40 years, 41 b:etween 40 and 60, and 10 to persons who had passed that period of life. Bronchitis carried off 127 persons, nearly 2alf of whom were men and women more than 6O years old. Twelve women died after childbirth. Five persons died from intemp-rance, without including in the itktaber those wvho may have received fatal injury in a state of intoxication. A smoLer died from mixing stramonium wita his tobacco. There were also 5 deaths from delirium. tremens. A boy of 9 years died in Salter's-alley, St. George-in-theEast, from cretinism. Three persons died on the 15th, 23d, and 2Sth of March respectively, from want. Last week the births of 994 boys and 933 girls,-im all 1,97T children,-were registered in London.

THE{ GOmDsNx LEcrunRrEsiP.-The Rev. Thomas Jackson, prebendary of St. Paul's and rector of Stoke Newington, has added his name to the list of candidates for the Golden Lectureship, about to be resigned by the Rev. AI. ioelvill. Mr. Jackson was formerly principal of the Battersea Training College, and upon the pronmotion of the Canterbury settlement in New Zealandvwas appointed its bishop. He went out to the colony, where he remained several months, but he was never consecrated, and upon his return to England he was presented by the Bishop of London to the rectory he now holds. His prebendal stall at St. Paul's is merely honorary. The Golden Lectureship is in the gift of the Haberdashers' Company. SINGULAR DETECTION OF ROxBBYRY ON THE NiDLA.]D RAIr.wAv.-Tho number of robberies which are known to take place on thle various railways of the coiuntry induce us to give puAblicity to the followving narrative, as proving what maybe done in their detection byw,ell-directed energy and perseverance. Persons unacquainted w ith the didficulty of ohtainina evidence necessaryfor prosecution can have no idea of theo didiculty of sustaining a railway indictment. The number of miles to be travelled, the variety of persons through whose bands the stolen property may have passed, and all of whom may be required as witnesses, render such a proceeding alike expensive and tedious. It would appear that in the early part of February last a railway servant named William Godwin, acting in the capacity of porter for the lidland Railvay at GlIcester, was detected in the commission of an offence which led to the searching of his house, and in which were discovered a quantity of articles susnected to have beeni stolen from the company. There were no fewer than nine new carving knives and forks, a quantity of ironmongery, and otherdeseriptions of miscellaneous property. Among these was found a very handsome sugar-basin, or, as the trade call it, a sugar-box. This particular article was ascertained to be the manufacture of Messrs. Copeland and Garrett, and of- this pattern and number, strange as it may appear, only four were made or sent out. The one in question was sold to a firm in Worcester, the second to a gentlemian in Cheltenham, the third to a china depOt in Bath, and the fourth to Mfessrs. Child and Co., of Edinburgh. The lady to whom it was sold by the finn in Worcester removed in the early part of 1853 to Bath,taking with her her china, plate, glass, &c. On the return of the family in June,1S54 she gave directions that the chins, together with other things, should be returned ridi Glocester to her house in Worcestershire. At Glocester the package containing the sugar-boxandthe restof theserviceof which it formedapart sustained such damage as rendered its detention necessary for repairs. Hero it was that the robbery -was committed, Godwmn being one of the porters engaged in the transshipment of tbat particular package. Although the sugar-box -as missed by the servant who unpacked the china, be concluded it had been broken in us<e, and consequently no inquiry w-as made after it, so that its ovner was not aware of her loss untilthebox was showin herby the company'spolice superintendent. The difficulties which interposed at every step of thisprotracted investigation can scarcely be conceived; butthey wiere overcome by the skill, tact, and unwearied perseverance of Mr. Farmer, the superintendent of the detective police employed on the Midland line A great many miles had to be travelled, parties who had left their previous occupations had to be sought out, books long consigned to dust and forgetfulness to be dragged to light, and the wvhole facts of the case, in all their ramiSicatsons,to be ehested and woven into a chain of consecutive edence. Allthis was accomplished by 3r. Farr oef mcost satisfactorily. The trial of Godwin took place at the Glocester sessions on Friday last, when the whole of the four sugar-boxes were produced in court, together with 23 witnesses from various parts of the country, including persons from Edinburgh, London, Newcastle, Bath, Cheltenham Worcester, Stoke-upon-Trent, &c.; and after an inquiry which lasted for several hours the prisonerwas found guilty and sentenced to 12 months' mmprisonment with hard labour. At the conclusion of the cause the chairman remarked upon the good which must necessarily result from the present prosecution, and observed that,heavyas was the expense, and enormous as had been the trouble bestowed upon the getting up of the c-ase, it would show that for the future the iwidland Railway Company would not suffetheniselves to be robbed with impunity. It is to be hoped that the spirited manner in which the investigation has been conducted, and the almost insurniountable difficulties of the case surmounted, will lead other railway establishments to follow the example of the Midland Company. If such should be the case we shall have to record fewer instances of railway robberies than we have had to do for a long series of years. It was stated in court that Mr. Superintendent Farmer had travelled 1,900 miles in prosecution of his influirses.
CITY SEWERS. SA1NTARY CONDITION OF THE. CITY, - . Yesterday, a ourt was Eeld; Deput& Peaock,ihe (hzr. . . DoctorLJErBY, the medical officer of-healt4i, laidbefore the Court the folowing report'- ;- * I ihve the honour te liay b'foreyou 'miy'quarterly report of the sanitary condition of the city. ' ' - "Since the 25th of Decemb'er, last yea0, your inspecto'r ave visited ,143 of. the houses inhabite'd by the6poor, and, shey h'ave furziised me withl returns respecting the water supply, drainage, cleanliness, ventilationl, &c .: large amount of improvemen t has, therefore, been effected, in all these particniars. ' I append, as usual, the mortality returns of the city of London for~ te last three months, and, in directing your attention to them, I have the sat sIac. tion to shto that the health of the citizens, as indicated by those returns, is remarkably good. The total number of deaths during the quarter is 737. 'Of these 245 occurred among infants under five years of age, and 105 had passed the allottedtime of threeicore years and ten. The following are the most important causes of death :-Consumption and mesenteric disease, 87; hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy, 58, measles and hooping-cougn, 48; typhus fever, 44; scarlet fever, 24; and smaallpox, 10. " On comparing the maortality of the quarter with that of the corresponding period during the last seven years, I find that the numberof deaths is considerably below the average; for instance, during tlle winter quarter of last year the nnmber of deaths was 929, the average being 854. In the present quarter, however, the number is only 737-a reduction of 21 per cent. below the former, and of 14 per cent. below the latter. According to the Registrar-Generalrs return for the 10 years, 1843 to 1852, it appears that the average mortality of all the towvns in England during the nmonths of January, February, and March is 69 per 10,000 of the inhabitants, and that the mortality in the country districts during the same perod is 56 per 10,000. Now the mortality of the citizens of london during the quarter has been only 5G-7 per 10,000, so that the health of the city of London has not only been 14 per cent, better than that of the towndistricts of England, but it has actually approached within a fraction the health of all rural districts. "Among the mortality returns of the quarter are 44 cases of typhusfever. The averago number during the year is 141. Most of these eases occurred at the London Fever oapital, at Islington, where the patients are sent as soon as the disease has become fully manifested. On inquiry I found that the mode of conveyance is always by the public cabs. I think it my duty, therefore, to direct your attention to this fact, and to say that there is considerable danger in it both to the public and the patient. Typhus fever is, as you all know, a most infectious and vimlent disease; and when you consider that the number of deaths annually recorded is but a small proportion of the number annually affected with the disease, and therefore of those who are so conveyed to the hospital, it must be manifest that there is considerable danger in such an employment of the public cabs. Within the last week I have oen informed that five persons in one family have been stricken with fever in consequenceof one of them having imprudently visited a tainted locality, and yet there are cases in which we are doing our best to expose any individual of the community to 'the influence of a tainted locality at every moment of the day. I have no hesitation in stying that the cabs which have been so emnployed are sufficiently infected to become a powerful means of spreading the disease, and I Imight apply the very same remar to the fact of the public vehicles being also used for the conveyance of persons affected with smallpox. " To the poor p.atient the danger which arises from this mode of conveyance is equaly fromn the vertical positionwhich he is obliged to observe and the uneasy jolting to which heis subjected, which are both likely so to depress his vital p owven as to give the mastery to the disease. A t the time of cholera, when the cabs are used in this manner, it is not at all an uncommon circumstance to fnd the patient dead in the arms of the attendant who is supporting him. The remedy for this mischief is simple and inexpensive. If the three city unions would each provide an ambulance car for the conveyance of the sick in an horizontal position it would cost 21o more to hire a horse for it when it is 3anted than it does at the present time for a public cab. I"I have brought these facts before your notice in order that they may be known to the guardians of the city poor, whom I have always found willing and anxious to benefit their fellow citizens. "I have thehonour to be, &c., "1 H. B. LBTHEBY, M.B., " Medical Officer of Health for the City "GuildhaU." of London. Deputy HOLT moved that the report of the 3ledical Officer of Health be referred to the Committee of General P'urposes. Deputy LOTT seconded the motion, and expressed a hope that Dr. Letheby's suggestion would be as soon as possible adopted, as calculated greatly to secure the public health, and contribute to the comfort of unfortunate patients. Tne motion was unanimously agreed to. Three of the dust contractors were fined in several penalties for having neglected to remove the dust from houses which they were bound to visit.

RLUNS JENST AUGUS.-COLLSION.. - - (Before Dr.LusinGTox.) se urig( ie, or tee purden ot mL tons, amnr zne nanove ian ship ren PrinsErnstAuguste, of- the burden of 493 fons, came into collision with eachotheroff Barry sland,in the Bristol-Channel, at a.m., on the- 12th of Jinuary last. Both vessels were coal laden, and were proceeding from Newport to Jamaica. The brig, aecording to her plea, having been towed to the mouth of the rirerUsk, thesteami ng was cast off, and the brig proceeded in company with the Pianove'rian, which hid left Nevwport Dock just before her, having been also in tow of a steamtug. The brig exhibited a- bright light at her bovwsprit, but no light was shown by the Hanoverian. The weather was somewhat hazy, with' a fresh breeze from about E.N.E. The Hanoverian, when a quarter of a mile a-head of the brig, ported her helm so as to bring ' her across the course upon which the brig was sailing. Thie brig, supposing that she was about to let go her suichor, hailed her to bold OD, but at the same moment heard the aound of chain running but, from which it became apparent that her anchor had actually been let go. In order to clear the Hanoverian the brig starboarded her helm and squared her asainyard, but before sufficient effect could be produced the Hanoveriai had begun to move astern, and had thus rendered the collision inevitable. On the part of the Hanoverian- it was alleged that immediately on her being brought up with her starboaxd bower anchor a bright signal lantern was hung up four feet above the rails of her topgallant forecastle. About half ain hour afterwards, while lying stem to tide, the br g was seen dig: tant about a mile, and, in order to prevent a collisionu another light was exhibited over the starboard side. The brig, however, continuing her course, was hailed to brace back her yards and port her helm, by which she would have been carried clear astern; but, instead of so doing, - she starboarded her helm, whereupon the Hanoverian also star'boarded, but without producing the desired effect, and the brig ran stem on into her, doing her very considerable da- mage. Cross actions were brought by the respective parties. Dr. Bayford and Dr. Spinks were heard for the brig; :3r. °Addams and Dr. Twiss for the Hl'anoversan. Thelearned JUDGE inquiredof the Elder Brethren, by whom he Wias assisted, whether the brig was to blame for negligently running into a vessel at ancher, or whether the collision was occasioned by the Hanoverian being suddenly brought up, wad not exhibiting a light, as she ought to have done. The ELDErF BJ3RETHR imputed the blame solely to the Hanoverian. The COURT pronounced accordingly. THE NORD AMERICA.-SALVAGF. This was an action brought by the Broadstairs lifeboat Mary White, the lugger Champion, and the steamtug Aid against the bark Nord America, to obtain a reward for salvage services rendered to her on the l9th of December last and following days off the North Foreland. The bar' bound from New York to Hamburg with a cargo of genera merchandise, struck upon the llbow shoal during a heavy gale, whereby she lost her rudder, and became exposed toa considerable peril. The lifebcoat reached her with great difliculty, and at the request of the master returned again to shore, and engaged the lugger and the steamntug. By the r,mited exertions of the salvors the bark was ultimately conducted to London. The value of the property salvedwas upwards of 24,000g. Dr. Jenner and Deane appeared for the salvors; Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss for the owners. The learned JuIJGE considered it a meritorious service, and awarded 1,2001. THE ALEXAENIDRIE.-SALVAGE. This was a-suit promoted by two sloops-the Pilgrim and the Rosabelle-to procure salvage remuneration for services rendered to the steamvessel Alexandrie on the 8th of January last, off Dartmouth. The engines of the steamer had become disabled, and her canvass was insufficient to enable her to reach the shore. She was taken in towv and brought in safety to Dartnouth harbour. The value of the property was 8,000l. Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss appeared for the salvors; Dr. Deane for the owners. The COURT allotted 3501.
SPRING ASSIZES. N70ORFOLK ~CIrCUIT NORWVICH. MAIcH 3L CROWN COURT.-(BeforC Mr. Justice WMIGHTmAN.) George Gray, aged 30, and John Bunkle, aged 29, were indicted for assaulting and wounding John Holdsworth, at Hindolveston, with intent to resist their lawful apprehension, and with intent to do some bodily harm. Mr. Evans conducted the prosecution, and Mr. W. Cooper and Mr. Bulwer defended the two prisoners. It appeared that John Holdsworth, being a keeper in the employ of Lord Hastings, was out watching on the evening of the 14th of November last with his son and anothec watcher, when, at half-past 8 o'clock, three men came up with three dogs, and, having set nets at twro gates leading into a driftway, sent the dogs into the field to hunt for game. The head-keeper thereon rushed out and seized one man by the collar, on which another poacher knocked him down with a fearful blow from a bludgeon on the head, which brought the blood over his eyes and almost "unsensed" him. The son, who was a mere lad, seized the skirts of the assailant's coat, but the man soon shook him off and all three made their escape. The keepers swore that the two prisoners were the chief actors in this affair, and that they thought the third was one Bastard, but they did not swear to him, though he was at first taken inlto custody with Bunkle and Gray. In addition to this, which was the case before the magistrates, two of the witnesses now caUed proved that when the two prisoners were " in hold " on the night of the assault they discussed the matter between them in terms plainly indicative of their guilt, and. agreed that they could not do better than plead "-Guiltys' This evidence was not given before the magistrates, though both the witnesses who gave it were then present, and one . was actually examined as to other fcts in the case, and it did not appear to have transpired until a very recent period. MIr. .BILWVEs, in his address to the jury for Bunkle, remarked strongly on this circumstance, and called upon the jury to infer from it that the prosecutors w-ere doubtful of the evidence of identity, and had sought by such suspicious evidence to strengthen the case. His LORDSur, having gone over all the evidence, left it to the jury to say whether they were satisfied both the risoners were nresent, and that both had concurred in the act of the one wilo had struck the keeper. The jtuy consulted together a few moments, and returned a verdict of Not Guilty. Sarah Hunniball, aged 31, was indicted for feloniously setting fire to the dwellinghouse of the Mayor and corporation of Yarmouth, one Joseph Giles being in it. Mr. Evans and Mr. Cherry were counsel for the prosecution. It appeared that on the 19th of the present month theI prisoner was an inmate of the Yarmouth gaol, and that, having faUen iil, she was taken to the infinnary, and there placed in a private bedroom. At 10 o'clock at night the matron visited her as usual, and left her going to bed without any light. In three-quarters of an liour she rang her bell violently,and whenMr. JosephGiles, the gaoler, and th i matron opened the door they found the bed and floor all on fire, the room fiUed with dense volumes of smoke, and th prisoner standing at the door gasping for breath and attired in her nightdress, over which she had 'dung a blanket. Fortunately the fire was soon extinguished, and on the folowing day the prisoner sent a message through the chaplain to the geaoler, to wShom she stated that after she had got into bed on the night in question she lay awvake,thinlcing howv she might destroy herself, till she recollected she had got a lucifer match, after wvhich she got up, and, lighting the match. set fire tothe bedcLothes, and then got into bed, but tha; when she felt the flamnes she did not like the pain, and go; up and gave the alarm by ringing the belL. - - Theprisoner, when called on for herdefence, was silint. The jury at once found her Guilty, and Sentence of death was recorded. Henry Watson, aged 50, and Joseph Neale, aged 36, were indicted for shootingat Henry Roberts, with intent to murder him and to do him bodily harm. : -Mr. Kaylor and Mr. Bulwer appeared for the prosecution. Mr. William Cooper defended the prisoners. The prosecutoris the gamekeeper of Mr. Bagge, the member for West Norfolk, and was out on the night charged in the indictment, when he and another keeper heard a gun fired in a wood.

On the part of the defendants,, the. first of these items was disputed on the ground that it was excessive, and That the remuneration to, the boatmen, as alvors, ought to havcbeennmade in accordance wvith the ordinary wages usually earned by such.. At the close of the case Chief Justice JERFVfS said that, in his opinion, the plaintiff could not recover any portion of the disputed items, except the charge for the boatmen, and the extent to which the defendants Aere liable for that was a matter for the jury to'decide. They must, however, reflect that the interests of society in a grat mnaritime country like England required that at-all times along its coasts there should be.a body of rsen of skdll and daring ready on occasions of emeigency- to venture their lives and property in attempts'to convey assistanfe-to vessels in distress, and that their remuneration should not 'be regulated by the apparent value of the vesel. This state of things could not be attained without awarding to salvors in the case of valuable ships such liberal salvage as would, when taken with other less valuable cases, in the whole compensate them for their general devotion to such perilous enterprises. By these means a sufficient stimulus to exertion 'would be kept alive. Now, the captain had actully paid the sum now sought to be recovered, and thie only q,uestion was whether the amount was, under all the circumstances, excessive. * The jury at once returned a verdict'for the plaintiff for 10. 13s. 64.

OXFORD CIRC17IT GLOCESTER& APRIL 1L CrM COURT.-(Bcfore Air. Justice CRESSWELSLand Speciaz Juries.). In the early part of the day several causes were disposed of. Several hours were occupiedin the trial of an action on a charterparty of no general interest. The rest of the day was taken up by the trial of an action against the Midland Xailw.-ay Company, to recover damages for the death of one of Mlr.Pickiford's clerks, by the alleged negligence of the company's servants. The trial was not concluded when we despatched our report. CRDTMAL COURT.-(Before Afr. Baron BR.AMW:ELL.) George Dawe, a sorter in the. post-office at Bristol, was charged with stealing two letters, containing money and stamps, at St. Werburgh's, Bristol, on the 12th of March. Mr. Whateley, Q.C., Mr. Alexander, Q°C., and Mi. Bros appeared for the prosecution; M. Skinner defended the prisoner. It appeared that, on the 12th of March last, the prisoner was employed as a sorter in the Bristol post-office. Many complaints had been made of theloss of letters, and, in:consequence, some parties were set to watch on the roof of the water-closet. In the evenhig of that day the prisoner came into the closet, and was seen to open a letter and take out something which he put in his pocket. He then took out another letter, w hich he also opened, and taking out what appeared to be coin, put itto his teeth as if to try it. He was immediately tak-en into custody, and three letters were found upon him. While he was being searched, he said it was the firsttime he had doneit,andhe shonld not have done so had it not been from grievious disappointment; and when the letters were found, he exclaimed, " Oh, my poor wife and family A" A letter found upon the prisoner and one found ln the closet were proved to have been posted in' the regular way the same day. One of them contained a crooked sixpence, which was identiied as one that had been sent to a young lady. The crooked sixpence had belonged to a rich man, and was sent to the young lady becaiuse she' thought it " lucky" to have it. Ir. SS-EB~xxs~ having addressed the jury for the prisoner,' the jury found him Guilty. * Mr. Baron BBvrAMLL sentenced him to four years' penal servitude. Cornelius Crowvley, a stamper of letters in the Bristol post-office, was cbarged with stealin a st letter containing; money onthe l9th of February, at St. Werburgh, BristooL MIr. Whateley, Q.C., Mr. Alexander, Q.C., and Mr. Bros appeared for the prosecation; Mr. Sawyer defended the .prisoner. This indictment also arose out of complaints which had been frequently made of late of the loss of letters at the Bristol post-office. The prisoner was suspected, and, in order to test hiu, a letter was carefully made up on the 19th of February last, in a black-edged envelope, and directed to the Rev. T. Ol"ad, Oriel College, Oxford. The letter cross, four POstage stamps, also mark-ed,and a printed bill. It was the duty of the prisoner to take the letters from the window, and, after stampin,g them with the Bristol postmsarks, to hand them to the sorter. The letter in question was posted at about 11 o'clock, and, when stamped, should have been handed over to a sorter named Elbrook, who had received instructions to look out for the letter. The letter was not seen by Elbroolc, and, in consequence, suspicion rested on the prisoner. A police-constable was immediately sent for, the prisoner was searched, and the marked sixpence was found on his person. The envelope and other contents were afterwards found in the viater-closet, which theprisonerhad been seen tovisit in the iiterval. Mr. SAWvYER having addressed the jury for the prisoner, tl.e jury found hun Gzilty. Mr. Baron BRASmWELL sentenced him to be kept in penal seavitude for four years. Mary Ann Rosser, a respectably-dressed and rather elderlv woman, was charged with bigamy, in marrying one James | UInderwood, her former husband being then alive. Mr. Partridge appeared for the prosecution; MIr. Skinner defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prisoner was married 24 years ago to, her first husband, by whom she had eight children. He had however, deserted her, leaving his house in company with the servant girl, with whom it was stated he was now living at Sydenham. He had snffered three months' imprisonment for his desertion of his wife; and as soon as he heard of her second marriage, he wrote a letter to the prisoner, in which he claimed " his goods," adding, that she was "now in his power." Mr. Skinner having addressed the jury for the prisoner, she was found Gtilty, but with a recommendation to mercy, on the ground of her husband's treatment of her. Mr. Baron Bl.UINVEILL, in passing sentence, said, this was a most disgraceful case-not on the part of the prisoner so much as on the part of the husband. His Lordship 'wished there was some law that would reach him, and if he could be tarred and feathered and paraded through Ledbury (where the wife resided), or if his future life could be mnade in any way uncomfortable to him, it wouldi serve him right. If he had put the law inl motion he would have - to ay for it, as the costs *of the prosecution would not be allowed. The prisoner, lowever, had broken the law, and must have some punish-l mnent. His Lordship then sentenced her to four days' implisonment. As the sentence dates from the first day of the assizes, the effect of the sentence was that the prisoner was at onceo discharged, and left the court with her second husband, who had been in court during the trial. Robert Thomas Palin, 22, shoemakcr, as clarxred with' 'hurgiariosly breaking and entering the dwellinghouse of -Jane Shepherd, and stealin therein one coat, two waist-' coat, and other articles, at honbury, on the night of the 18th of August, 185i5. Mr. Skinner appeared for the prosecuttion; the prisoner was undefended, n'b l It appeared that, on the day before the burglary, the pIsoner was seen by the prosecufrix at Thornbury. In live days after he was found at Croydon, disposing of one of the waistcoats which had been stolen, and was taken into custody. The jury found him Gtilty. It w as then stated that the prisoner was a ticket-of-leave man, who had been transported for 10 years, but discharged for good conducet. Hfe had recently been tried at M1aidstone -hfor murder, but acqultted. Mfr. Baron BB., awnnV sentenced him to be transported for life.
FItRE IN FLEET-STREET.-Last night, about halfpast 7 o'clock, a fire, attended -with a serious loss of propexty, broke out in the range of premises belonging to Messrs. Dobbs and Co., wholesale fancy stationels and envelope n1anufacturers, of 134, Fleet-treet. The premises in which the disaster commenced were of considerable extent, being bounded on one side by the printing-office of Messrs. Vizetellyandthe extensive range of buildings belongin to lessrs. Levy and Co., -while the printing-offices of the Mornin lHerald, in Shoe-lane, nearly flanked them on the north-eastern side. It appears that the police officer on duty in the street had his attention directed to the place by a strong smell of burning vwood, and, after examining for a fewv minutes the different courts leading round the back (f the factory, he found that the buildin -was on fire. -With little delay the engines of the parish, the Iondon Brigade, and West of Englaud office, under the command of Mr. Snperintendent Braidwood, Mr. Wolf, and Mlr. Connorton, attended, when, the hose having been stretched out znd applied to the engines, it was carried through the -different houses, by means of which some thousand tons. weight of water were distributed upon the flames; bfit -several of the surrounding houses-great houses of busiuness-frequently became ignited. Fortunately they were; owing to the labours of the firemen, not damaged to any great extent; but it was not until half-past 10 o'clock that the fire might be said to have been conquered, an-d -not until the premises of Mfessrs. Dobbs were entirely ~destroyed, and the prerniises of Mr. Clarke, ublisher, Xr. Pe'tit, bookseller, Mr. Clark, draper, Mr. atts, eooper, and Messrs. Hlnghes and Kimber severely da6ea by wvater.

Od. in postage stamps from "1;. B.," of Chester, to be added to the amount raised tovards the wants of the poor wroman, Mrs. Morris, whose case appeared in the papers of the 21st of Marlch. An acknowledgment by the press was requested. Bowv-sTnnar.-The Rev. James Charles Ward, a clergyman, who had been brought before Mr. HENriy by warrant, on a previous day, charged with sending letters to the Queen, Lord Palmerston, Sir George Grey, and other mem. bersof Her Majesty's Government, attended punctually at 12 o'clock, the hour 'ixed for the further hcaring of the case; but at that time none of the Government officials had arrived, although Dr.Wakefield, the m edicaliwitness required to depose as to the state of defendant's rnind,and other witnesses were present. - - Shortly after 12 Sergeant Hodges, of the A division, waited apon the magistrate with amessage from Mr. Green. wood, the solicitor to the Treasury, to the effect that he - 'would attend at 1 o'dlock. Mr. HENsY observed that the defe'ndant and the witnesses (including Dr. Wakefield, whose time was of great value to him) had been in attendance some time. '1The postponemnent of the case for an hour would be very inconvenient to them, he feared. Perhaps the officer had better return to Wr. G&eenwood, and mention this circumstance. Sergeant Hodges said M£r. Greenwood was awareofit. - Mr. Burnby, chief clerk.-How can he be aware that the parties are present and waiting? Sergeant Eodges meant that Mr. Greenwood knew that they were to be in attendance at 12. Mr. HxEtRY.-However, you- had better return and reauest Mr. Greenwood to be here as specdily as possible. After the departure of the officer with this message, The Rev. J. C. Ward, the defendant, entered the coust,. and expressed his regret and annoyance at the postponement of the cate In order to be punctual himself he had gone without a breakfast; and, having made an appointment for 2 o'clock, this delay would put him to the greatest possible inconvenience. Did his worship feel bound, under these circumstances, to oblige him to stop? Mr. HENRY equally regretted the delay which had arisen, and which was probably occasioned by Mr. Greenwood hiving other important business to transact at the Treasury. If the defendant had not breakfasted he could take the interval before 1-oclock for that purpose. The defendant said the case night then come on, or something might be said, in his absence. Already be had been entrapped into aconversation at the Treasury, which mightsossibly be used to his prejudice. MWr. riys.r would take care that his case did -not suffer from either of these circumstances. The defendant thought he had better remain, and, having requested the favour of being supplied -wnth a copy of the statute under which these proceedings were taken, the rev. kentleman sat down in the attorneys' bex, and applied his mind to the 16th and 17th of Victoria, chap. 97, complaining occasionally of the irregular manner in which Government business was conducted. It is only fair to add that the rev. gentleman is by no means singular in his opinion respecting the conduct of public business at these courts by the Government officialsinalmost every department, excent the Post-office. The ordinary proceedings are constantly interrupted, and the prosecutors and witnesses in other cases as repeatedly inconvenienced, by the invariable unpunctualityof Her Majesty's servants rwhenever they are mntrusated with a prosecution. At half-past 1 o'clock M£r. Ward asked his worship to state if he did not thinl. that the Government authorities who were about to inquire into his (defendant's) state of mind were not abusing the license which his worship had kindly granted them. Mr. HNvRY said MIr. Greenwood had just arrived, and advised the defendant to go and confer with him in a pri.- vate room. Eventually, at about. 2 o'clock, the defendant having returned to the court, the case proceeded. Mrr. Greenwood, the solicitor to the Treasury, said,With respect to this inquiry, your wgorship. I1 have ;lready apologizedl to Mr. Ward, and I must now apologize to -you for the delay which has, unavoidably, just occurred-; but I - have received some information to-day in reference to other matters connected with Mr. Ward than have been yet disclosed, and which it will be necessary to bring under vour notice. I have had no opportunity of getting the re - quisite proof of these additional matters since they have come to my knowledge, and therefore I must apply.to your worship to allowthe warrant to standover to a futuro dasay, for a fortnight, to admit of the production of this v dence, the defendant being permitted, as before, to We at large upon his parole. The defendant decidedly objected to this -proposition on public grounds-on grounds of right and justice. Is the; fist place, one of the consequences of this prosecution had been the publiation of the proceedings in the public journals. It Mad gone forth to the world at large that he had been branded asalunatic, andhe claimedtheright ofareply through the same public channeL It would be inferred from, these reports that he had been writing and calling on Lord Derby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Pamerston, and others, without authority, whereas he had business transactions with those persons, and had repeatedly seen them. He had had freauent interviews with Lord Palmerston on matters wholly unconnected with this in- Mr. ENRY.-You need not go into that. The matters were referred to incidentally, without being relied on in support of the charge. Defendant.-Then, these letters and interviews ought not to have been mentioned. I will now proceed to the next point. Mr. HEN\RY.-As lIr. Greenwood has deferred going into his case for the present, you had much better refrain from further remarks at present. Defendant.-I wish the warrant and information to be brought into court. 3rz. HESRY.-With what object? They ha-e not disclosed their case on the other side-why should you reveal yours? You are not prejudiced by the postponement of the case. You have been, and still are to be, free. Defendant.-I am not free, and that is one of my points. Let the warrant be produced. The information and warrant were read and proved. They charged the "Rev. J. C. Ward" with vwandering abroad, being ina state of lunacy. Defendant suggested that the insertion of the initials J. C." rendered the iarrant ineffective-legally null and void. Mr. HESRY said this was immaterial. In a warrant of this nature it was not even necessary to give anv name at alL A description of the person would be sufficient. Defendant begged his worship's pardon. The case of ["Reynolds v. Henkin," 4th Barnwell and Alderson, was a case in point, showig, as it did, that a man could not be arrested upon his initials. Mr. HANiY.-That'was not a warrant under the Lunacy Act. Besides,;you have refued to give your name. Do you still decline to do so ? Defendant.-I do not decline. Mr. HRY.-Then, what is yoir name? Defendant.-That's another affair. Mr. HENRY.-No. You were not klown at your lodg ings. Your landlady described you as "the nknown gentleman," and you stlll decline to state your name. fendant.-I do not decline to state my name. - r. HEny.-Then, what is it? Defendant.-That's another question. (A laugh.) I must take the liberty to aslk you your motive in asking for my name. Isit to amend the warrant? 3Ir.HENRY.-The warrant shall not be altered. It is not necessary to alter it. The defendant, still refusing to state his name, then proceeded at great length to object to the whole proceedings, as he stated, in lim-ine, and claimed the right of examining ir. Yardiey asto the-motive of the Police Commissioners in directing his arrest. He also demanded of Mr. Yardley anexplanation of the grounds upon which he considered him (defendant) to be a lunatic. Mrz. Yardley was exposed to a long cross-examination upon this point. The witness repeated his former evidence, and stated that the defendant had bceen for some time under the observation of the police in consequlence of his apparent insanity. It had been the desire of the Police Commission im plyto have him restored to his family, if his friends couldbe discovered, and their wishes with respect to him ascertained; but he had always declined to give any satisfactory information upon this point, at one time referring incoherently to a Queen's counsel, and at another time to the late member for Canterbury, and always speaking and acting in such a way as to satisfy him (Mr. Yardley) that he was labouring under mental delusions. After occupying more than an hour in cross-examining Mr. Yardley, the defendant proceeded to address the Court for another hour upon the iniquity of a British subiect being dragged by the poalice through the public streets like a conmmon felon, within sight of the House of Commons and the courts of Westminster, regretting that he could not command the graphic style of a Dickens or a Shakspeare to describe the outrage commaitted upon him. Mr. HxmqxY reminded the defendant that he had not been dragged through the public streets at all, that he had not been arrested in the way described, and that he had- been kent under no restraint whatever. T he defindant said he was aware, of this, but still proceeded4,'*h extraordinary garrulity, in -the same strain, [finall5r demanding, with i-seriousness which appeared to -give he prosecution moreo onfinition than was expected,' that there should be a commission de tunatico intquireado against Xx Yardley forthwith; in consequence of the ex-traordisy delusions under which that gentleman appeared t;o- be alSoring. He Complained of illness- and pi-sicaln exhaustionj resulting from his having had no bre.Bkast, but still continued his addrss 'till past 4 o'clock, without hope or signobf abatement. MffrENiRs entreated himn to consider that the only ques. tion before the Coutrlsas the that for adjourning the case, Already the-other business-of the Conrt had been kept back for hour through his perslsting to aadressthe Court.

A CURIOUS SPECULATION. The Dublin Nation contains a curious article, in 'which the writer declares his deliberate conviction that there 'exist reasons of a reliable 'character for believing that Mr. John Sadleir has not committed suicide, but has simply been playin~ the trick, so well known both in history and. romance, of a pretended death and a sutpposititions corpse. The following may be cited as the grounds ort which the writer bases his scepticism as to John Sadleir's suicide:- 1. While the dates of the letters written by fMr. Sadleir to his friends show that he meditated suicide a full week before he is supposed to have effected it, he was striving all that 'week to get in money from every source, and did r- ceive large sums-some on the day of his death-pot farthing of which has beentraced oraccounted for At the very brink of the grave, it is urged, when money oujht naturally to cease to be valuable in his eyes, he was a intent as ever on acquiring it. 2. In Paris andIonblanque's 1cdic .Tztri*prtdcncc it is laid down as a general rule that the more-sudden the death the longer is cadaverous stiffess from taking place; and it is further stated, as to causes of sudden death, " If a body in such cases be cold and stiff we may be certain that more than 12 hours have elapsed since the fatal event." The evidence at the inquest showed that in any case MT. Sadleir could nothave reached Hampstead before 12 o'cloclq, at the earliest, and might not have reached it before half-past 1, at the latest; and, supposing him to have really comniitted suicide, that event would have taken place at the earliest at half-past 12 'clock, and at the latest at-say, 2 o'clock. At a quarter before 9 in the morning Policeman S 323 found the body at Rampatead " quite cold and stiff." Mr. Nichol], surgeon, gave similar evidence. 3. Doubtful identification of deceased.-obn Sadlse.fs bodywas removed, says the article, to the Hampstead workhouse, without having been exanmined by auy competent person. Its sworn identificationbefore the jury was, extraordinary to relate, not by any of the relatives, though they iwerein town, butby apersonnainedEliwyn, whobhad beenin Sadlerisemploymentbut 18 months. The body was not identifLed ny him by marks or peculiarities of structure. One passage inthe evidence of -r. Norris, thesolicitor, hbowed, moreover, of what extremelylittle value was Elwyn's evidence in this partic =la; for, while the latter states thae "he had not observed any change in his master during the last month or two," and that ris master's "manner on Saturday was the same as uual," the jury are, on the contrary, informed by Mr. Norris that Mr. Sadleir "latterly appeared haggard," and that "he noticed an extraorainary change in his appearance during the last 'week," and especially on Saturday, &c. As to the identification of the body, it may, in addition, be not undeserving of remark tbat the reports in the public press speak of a change in the features of the deceased, and of his looking older than he really was. 4. In the work of Dr. Taylor, the toxicologizt, 'which Sadleir, it is stated, had been perusing on the day df his death, is the discussion of a. question as to whether dark hair can be artificially changed to light, and his acccunt of sundry vwashes of recent invention 'which efiectua'Jy pro. duce the result. Most important, it is remarked, in connexion with this fact, is the evidence of Elwyn, who deposed to tne jury-" IMr. Sadleir had previously that evening asked him to clean two bottles, and place them on the sideboard,whichhedid. He (witness) did not know that it was poison he had to get at Mr. Maitland7s. He thought it was some ingredient in a hairwash 'which his master was goingto mix in the two bottles which had been placed on the sideboard." A man who had just posted letters stating his intention to commit suicide, who had sent out for poison, 'who was racked with the burden of frauds, forgeries, tottering banks and railways, was encaged as a prelude to his cxtraordinaryend,inpreparng a airwash. 5. The.place where the body was found.-MWhy shoulda Sadleir, intending to malke away with himself by poison instantaneous in its effects, trudge o-tt to Hamnpstead-beath, in the middle of the niglht, for the purpose, first putting into his poeketapieceofpapertotell his name? A very intelligible purpose is suggested by the following ehad of inquiry, estracted from a long list of such fromn the second volumue of Paris and2 Fonb&rng2uc'is McdCeia Jtarisprudence: "p letherthespot inquestionbeofadescription t4oex_pliinthe cause of the decea;sed having been found thr em or how far its retired situation excites the 'suspicion tlat the body had been conveyed for concealment or some Ather purpose."1 The article concludes with a remark upon the excessive 'ease with which a body for the nonce could be proctarea among the2A millions of the population of London.

IBBLLAND. DUBLIN, TUESDAY MORNINC. (REOM OUR OWN CORESFONDNET.) THE IRISH JUDICIAL BEITCH. The death of MIr. Justice Torrens, announced in !The Times' second edition of yesterday) h,s, for obvious reasons, created a degree of public interest more than commensurate with the occurrence of an event at any other time of scarcely third-rate inportance, even in the eyes of the gossipilg quidnuncs of the Irish capital. The learned judgc had attained to the ripe age of 81 years, and, elthough for a long time past he had been a martyr to physical infirmities, there were no recent symptoms to warrant the impression that the hour of dissotion wvas so ne.ar at hand. He expired at I)errynoid-lodge, in the county of Londonderry, -on Saturday evening, after having, in conjunction with Baron Pennefather, despatched the business of the North-west Circuit, from its opening at Longford to its close at Londonderry, and was but one day absent from temporary indisposition. The following memoir of the late Judge is condensed from the FreernaiLs Journall- "Judge Torrens was called to the bar in Michaelmas Term, 17°S, and raised to the bench in l823. Thus he had been for 5S ears amember of the bar, and 33 a judge. .He never filled any of the higher offices of the law, having attained only the rank of serjeant; but the influence of his brother, Sir Henry Torrens, who occupied a distin- uished position in ths army, and wsas deep in the conhidence of George the Fourth when l'rince Regent, securedtheelevation of his brother to thebench. Judge Torrens had far inferior claims to many who had been passed over; but in those days, as indeed in succeeding tines, party and interest determined judicial promotions instead of experience, ability, and judicial fitness. His :Lordship, however, was a judge of average merit, and made up on the bench for the deficiencies arising from professional inexperience while at the bar. His intellect was clear, though notvery comprehensive. He took coinmon-sense -elewa of questions, and rarely ventured beyond his depth. In the administration of criminal justice he was somewhat severe, particularly during his first years on the bench, when the disturbed state oft te country, with overflowing assizes and constant commissions, afforded scope for a vigour not always within the law. In his later years, however,thetendency was corrected, and he tried most cascsinvolvinglife with a tenderness which Mr. Justice Perrin might admnire. With reg,ard to his successor, there are vrious rumours. It is stated the Attorney-General will refusetheappointment. Of course, the Solicitor-General would have the right of refusal after Mr. Attorney had rejected the tempting lure. WVe know not what truth there may bein the prevwalent rumour that Mfr. Brewster, on the faith of some secret arrangement with the present Government, would succeed to the vacancy. We incline to believe that Mr. Fitzierald -will be the new junior justice of the Common Pleas. I aunde-rs of this morning states that the rtumour in legal circles is that the Attorney-General will decline the vacant seat, and that the SolicitorGeneral will be the new judge. It is further believed that the office of Solicitor-General is to be offered to M1r. IsraLc Butt, Q.C., and member for Youghal. CO3IPTIVE EXAMLNATION. MIr. John MrKenna having been duly examined, was on Thursday inducted into his office in the department of the Chief Secretary, Dublin Castle. He is son ofthe late Mlr. Thomas M':Kenna, A ssistantUnder-Secretary. A clerkship in the Lunatic-office, Dublin, is vacant by Mr. M'Kenna's appointment. IRISH COAST DEFENCES. Peace having been duly proclaimed, and the war being at an end, the authorities have begun to turn: -their eyes to the defenceless state of the Irish coast. Here, for instance, is a sample of their newborn vigilance- *' Among the variousworks erected for the defence of the west coast, and particularly of the noble estuary of Bantry Bay, the most important are those on Whiddy island. They consist of three circular redoubts crowning three separate eminences, each surrounded by a fosse 30 feet wvide and 30 feet deep, with scarp and counterscarp walls, beyond -which is a glacis running down to the sea. The only mode of reaching the redoubt, therefore, is byaporteullis and drawbridge. The contractor under the Ordnance Board, hur. D. W. Murphy, of Bantry, has been for some time past occupied in making preparations for the mounting of the guns intended to form the armament. This is to consist of 12 24-pounders on the centre, and eight on each of the east and west redoubts. It is not intended actually to mount the gum at once, which can be sent from Woolxvich in the course of a few days to meet any emergency, but everything else, to the putting down of the racing irons, will be in readiness. These redoubts are sufficiently large to afford barrack accommodation to 600 men." THE COM %N.D AT COVE. The departure of Admiral Sartorius elicits the following remarks from the Cork FDiaminer of 3Ionday "T1his gaLant officer strikes his flag to-morrow, to the deep regret, and, we fear, the serious injury, of the local -public. We never knew an iustance where a high official seemed to gather round himi so readily the respect -and confidence of all classes as Sir George Sartorius has done during his short command. Only six months the Admiral of the Port, he has made himself respected not more for his courteous, kindly, and most conciliatory demeanour than for the deep interest which he h.as displayed in whatever could advance the interests of what Sir George himself declares to be one of the finest and most important of all the harbours in the British dominions. Great hopes wvere founded on the supposed duration of his commnand; but these have been rudely dispelled by -his removal, though on promotion. Those who have the pleasure of knowing the gallant admiral recognize in him not merely the daring and successful naval offlcer, who has upheld the honour of his flag in many a bloody fight, but the accomplished scholar, the man of taste as well as ertdition." THE L'.TE CATASTROPE IJN cORrd. The following details of the late dreadful, accident in Cork are supplied by the Exansiter, whichreached this mormn : "One of the niost appalling and terrible accidents which probably has ever become matter for detail in a newspaper, and certainly the most disastrous that has occurred in Cork as regards the loss of human life, -within the memory of the oldest person living, took place on Saturday night in this city, shortly after the hour of 12 o'clock. At that time, and for some hours previously, " a wake" was being held on the body of a chil about two years old, the son of a man niamed Patrick Sullivan, a cooper, residing in a place caLed Penrose's-lane, a lane running off the North Mainstreet, and connecting the Lhtter with Duncan-street. We believe there are few but those whose hard lot it is to live in the wretched lanes which branch off either side of the North Main-street wvho have the slightest conception of the misery, the squalor, and unmistakeable signs of dilapidation and decay which encompass the visitor on every hand. With breadtlh scarcelv sufficient to admit more than a single passenger, and niuch too narrow to permit of two persons v;alking abreast, the houses, dirty, dingy, and apparently for many years past going> rapidly into decay, generally rise to the height of three stories on either side of those miserable alleys. In the front room of an upper story in Penrose's-square the friends of the father of the deceased child assembledon Saturday night to the nunmber, it has been stated, of 40 or 30; and, after visiting the place yesterday, how they succeeded in finding room for such a number in a space so utterly disproportionate it is difficult to understand. It is stated that the usual kind of entertainment vhich is provided on those occasions was being indulged in, when suddenly one of the visitors exclaimed that 'the floor was sinking.' Sullivan, the father of the deceased child, who was standing with his back against the door, said 'that could not be, as there vas not-there sufficient to bring it down.' lie had scarcely uttered the words wvhen, X ithout further warning, crash wvent tle floor, and one appalling, ter-ific shriek from all assembled showed that they fully realized the dreadful fate that awaited them. Down came t-he living weight, crushing and smashing everything that interfered to arrest its fearful descent, and, carrying the first floor completely away, the eistire mass of human beings, men, women, and children, timber, beams, bricks and mortar, and whlatever articles of domestic furniture the house conltainied, were aU precipitated on the basement story into one hopeless, inextricable mass, in wvhich the dead, the dying, and the comparatively unnjured lay piled on each otier to the depth of five or six feet. A cry of horror arose from those whose faculties w"-ere not completely paralvzed, which wvas quickly taken up by the persons outside, and an alarm was at once spread that the unhappy inmlateS were all destroyed. Constable Carey and twso of the men beloagig to the Tuckey-street station wrere quickly on the spot, and a vigorous effort was made to force the door and lowver windowvs, but the pressure from inside offered a resistance that could not be overcome. A ladder was procured, and on opening one of the upper windows a picture of human suffering and agony and death was p resented which it is utterly inipoisible to describe. By this time a large body of the police force had arrived, and a number of active and inteliggent citizens were also present and rendered -v aluable assistance. By a vigorous exertion the door and lowerwindows were forced, and steps were promptly taken to rescue the sufferers from the mass of rubbish, bricks, motar, and other materials in which, it mightbe said, theywere literally embedded. In directing and personally assisting in this work of mercy efficient andvaluable assistancewas renderedbySub-inspector De Gernon, chief of constabulary in this city; Mr. Maguire, M. P., th e llayor, Drs. Sandh am, Ca llinan, and Allen, to".ethewithflend Constables CrowleyandRoe, .and Constables uarey, Meagher, Phselan, and a large number of constables and civilians. When the bodies had been extricated and conveyed into the street, it was found that eight were actually dead, and several others expired before medical aid could be ap.lled. A considerable proportion of those in whom even a 'mmerinn of life a~ppeared were tak:en to the North Infirmary, wmere, having bee previously made aware of the catastrophe, Drs. Bullen and Einn wsere prepared for their reception, assisted by the medical residents oY the infirmary, Mfessrs. William Roche and Rice. At an early hour yesterday morning it was ascertained that the entire number of persons killed amounted to 19, of whom six remained at the North Infirmary, five had been removed to the Bridewell, and eight had been taken to their various homes by their friends. It has been ascertained that there are 19 other persons who are muoreor less wounded, some of whom remain .at the North Infirmary, and others am treated in their own homes. 4 From an early hour yesterday morning the North Mainstreet and Duncan-strect were crowded by curious spectators, and the lane itself was renidered all but impassable by thoeg- anxious to get a viow of the scere of the tragedy. The house itjlf uresen-ted an e-traordinary appearance-the two floors in the front p art of the building were brought down as completely as if nothing had ever existed but thel four walls; not an inch of wood or the slightest portion of brick or mortar projected from the walls, in the sides of 'which the fireplaces only remained. It is equally str4g that the back part of the iouse was scarcly in y degree aeetea by the aestuct.n of the greater 'tortion of the front, the stairs remained untouched, and It is owing to this fortunate circumstance that, in all probability, a much greater loss of life has not to be deplored. " An inquest was held at the Bridewell, at 12 o'clock this day, upon the bodies deposited there, before tle two city coroners and a highly respectable and intelligent jury. After a number of witnesses had been examined the jury returned a vordict, ' That the deceased Mary Noonan, Mfary Noonan, jun., Mary Murphy, and Patrick Lynch respectively came to their death in consequence of the fall of the room of a house in Penrose's-lane, the said room being overcrowded at the time by persons collected at a wake, and we nre of opinion that several lives were saved by the praiseworthy exertions of Sub-Inspector De Gernon, and the constabulary under his command.'

(BY ElECl'tIC TELEORAPII.) TIJ13DAY EVEN'ING. THE TIPPERARY BANE. The Blecning Post has an outhne of some important proceedings *which took place to-day in the Master's-office. Mlessrs. Morrogh and Kennedy were examined at considerable length by 3Ir. Lawless, counsel to the official manager, touching the extensive purchases made in the Encumbered Estates Court by the late John Sadleir with a view to elicit the sources from wlhich the purchase money came, and what portion was derived from the Tipperary Bank. They were also examined as to the several bank securities, deeds, &c., in their custody, and were directed to lodge them, subject to their lien for costs. Mr. Morgan O'Connell, of the Tipperary Bank, has been subpoenaed as a witness, but did not attend. The rlaster said he would grant an attachment against Mr. O'Connell, but Mr. Meldon explained that the subpcena was not served till late last night, and requested an adjoiunment to a future day. At the close of the proceedings, Mr. MIeldon said he felt bound to state that since his appointment he had found the greatest villingness on the part of Messrs. MIorrogh and Kennedy to afford him every information and assistance in their po-wer. Mr. Kennedy said that as this was the first opportunity afforded him since the motion in the Rolls Coiurt, he now availed himaself of it to state publicly and on oath that he had no knowledge of, or connexion whatever with the report issued by the Tipperary Bank in February last, and that he had never seen it until it appeared in the newspapers. With respect to the petition for winding up the affairs of the bank, he stated that it was not presented at the suggestion of Mr. James Sadleir, but bcldufide on the part of the petitioner. Mr. Mlorrogh wished to add, on his part, that he wvas eqlually ina position to deny any connexion -hatever with the report of February last. In the course of the proceedings it appeared that some 20 conveyances of property in Ireland were executed by the late John Sadleir to the London and Coiuty Bank in August last, and it was elicited that previous to that date an agreement had been entered into by John Sadleir to transfer those estates to the Tipperary Bank as security for the large advances made to him.
.MEDICAL LEGISLATION. TO TUE EDITOE OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The draughtsman of Mr. Headlam's Melical Bill yesterday appeared in your columns as its apologist, and your readers can judge whether he succeeded in dislodging me from any of my positions of attack. I hope that my unaltered opinions on the subject may not be disrespectful to a gentleman who appears to have taken great pains with a difficult legislative problem. First, he praises the objects of the bill. So also did I; for substantially they are the same as have been aimed at by all medical reformers-by Mr. Warburton, Mr. Hawes, MEr. Wakley, Sir James Graham, and others; ard my objections were exclusively aimed at Mr. Headlam's ill-devised means for attaining those desirable ends. Next he describes me as " objecting to registration being into two classes (of medical practitioners), instead of into three and states that the latter plan "failed signally, the measure in which it was proposed being defeated by the strong professional feeling manifested against it." The "Draughtsman!'musthavemisreadwhatlwrote. My objection was to that system of mock-classification, whether it be into two divisions or into three; and my suggestion in its stead was "the plan of a single alphabetical register, so constructed as to set opposite the name of each legally qualified practitioner a specification of his medical titles." Thirdly, he is " unable to see the force of your correspondent's remarks" wvith regard to the so-called representativeplan of iMr. Headlam's council. This inabilityisnatural to a parent's vision. But to others than " The Draughtsman of the Bill" it will surely have been obvious that any such system of representation is at least far too complex for efficiency; that a triennial election of eight persons by universal medical suffrage through the united ingdom would be an uneasy, if not a demoralizing process for the profession; that systematic and continuous co-operation is unlikely to obtain between 24 men, of whom nine shall be resident in England, nine in Scotland, and six in Ireland; that the delegates of 16 rival institutions are likely to begin business after the famous example of the Kilkenny cats; and, after all, that this "representative" council-cumbrous, impotent, quarrelsome, and irresponsible-would not evan affect to represent those who are primarily concerned in the objects for which the council is instituted. Fourthly, charges of selfislmess are brought against those institutions whiclh have protested against Mr. Headiam's legislation, and praises are given to one which consents to be enriched. Accusations of interestedness are easily made and easily retorted; but, if it be true that against Mr. Headlams nieasure areranged all the Universities of the united kingdom, both Apothecaries' Companies, and the three Rtoyal Colleges of Surgeons, while the three Colleges of Physicians (wllich are to be so largely benefited by the change) give it but a very doubtful sanction, the public may draw an inference opposite to " The Draughtsman's" conclusion. Lastly, Mr. Headlam's bill is " accepted by an immense majority of the profession which it is designed to regulate." This acceptance has been, I believe, mainly conditional on expectations lvhicll the bill does not attempt to realize. " Sound protection from the impositions of unqualified pretenders" was one of the three points of a charter of medical reform lately promulgated in your paper by a " General Practitioner of Faversham," as representing the objects of his brethren. Yet, not only (as he emphatically remarked) is this protection not given in Mr. Headlam's bill -as, indeed, it never can be given-but even those restrictions are to be removed which for the last 40 years have made it punislhable to practise without license as an apothecary. HIalf the little popularity of M1r. Headlam's bill depended on the belief that it would suppress all illicit poaching on medical preserves. The other half depended on " The Draughtemaf's" plausible theory of " regulating the profession" by a Representative Council. Here again the supposed desires of tlle profession were e-xpressed by your Faversham correspondent, as a second point of his medical charter :-" They wish to see a medical Parliament that can manage their affairs." On this fallacy I havealreadycommnented; and "TheDraughtsman" doesnot touch smy objection. Each practitioner has his own individual and separate duties-noble duties, too-to tend the sick and to make progress in science; but I have never yet been able to learn what are the affairs-that is to say, the collective or corporate affairs-of the medical profession. The real purpose of M1r. Headlam's council is not (as " The Draughtsman" intimates) to "regulate the profession," to deal -with the mutual relations of its members, or to interfere with anything which, properly speaking, is internal and private to their community. If it were so, his plan for a cumbrous and inoperative council, however iexpedent, might not be irrational; but the sole purpose of the intended council is to regulate the conditions under which candidatesmay obtain their licenses for medical nraetice. It is chiefly for the public interest that the LeIgslature will interfere in this matter, and, looking to that interest as its primary object, the House of Commons cannot fail to observe that 3fr. Headlam's machinery is planned on a different understanding of the case. I am. Sir. vour obedient servant Sq Tq. T April 1. r &U. ow ue wIlite writing to amend an estimate which in my last letter I left vague, and, perhaps, exaggerated. In reference to the future registration-income of 3rr. Headlam's council I alluded to the yearly entrances on medical practice in the united kingdom as aboat 2,000. - This sapposition -was suiggested to mne by a well-infbir~kmedicni fnend; but probably fit is over the mark. Vere are no public matenals for estimating correctly how snapy persons enter on pracetice; but the only important financial point is that under the proposed system every entrance on the medical profession will be attended by a6 nlew payment c-f 12g. ; and obviously it wil matter notEd_~ to each individual contributor whether his fellow;psferers be one thousansd or two.
NA 7A14 AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, Lbhe fleet at Spithead Wu augniented yesterday ia on Monday by the arrival of five sal of the line, a corvette, a frigate, and sundry mall craft from Kingston, Queenstown, Plymouth, Liverpool, and elsewhere, swelling the force at that anchorage to the following proportions:- Guns . )ower Crew. Duke of Wellington (flag. ... 131 700 1,100 Royal George .102 400 920 Conqueror . .100 800 0 Nile. ... ... ... 90 500 S50 Orion . .. ... 91 600 850 Cressy ... . ... ... . . 80 400 750 olossus. ... ... ... 80 400 750 Sanspareil ... ... ... ... 70 400 626 Ha'wke ... ... ... ... 60 2o0 600 Hogue . .. ... ... ... ... 60 450 600 Hastings. 60 200 600 Russe . . 60 200 600 Edinburgh ... ... 5S 450 681 Arrogant ... ... ... ... 47 360 450 Pearl . .. ... ... ... 20 400 260 Cossack ... ... ... ... 20 250 240 Retribution (flag) ... ... ... 22 400 300 Cruiser ... ... ... ... 17 60 160 Magiciennr ... ... ... .. 16 400 220 Horatio ... ... ... ...

Nearly 30 of these, forming the red squadron, under Captain Codrington, C.B., got under way yesterday morning, at 9 o'clock, from the Motherbank, and stood out for the eastward, through the roadstead of Spithead, and when off the Knab were practised in forming line, giving chase, and other evolutions at a distance of one cable's length from each other and two abreast; and at half-past 11 o'clock the white division, under Captain the Hon. H. Keppel, C.B., got under way from the bMotherbank, and joined the red division off St. Helen's. These craft formed a most animated picture as they stood out and made their manceuvres. They exercised off Southsea-beach, Southsea-castle, and the head of the Spit for some time, and drew to the promenade and the walls of the garrison vast numbers of spectators. They were doubtlessly rehearsing part of the programme (or maniouvring for the arrangement of one) to be the order of the day for the grand naval review by Her Majesty, which is still .fixed, we are informed, for the 16th, the Levee announced for that day baving been changed to the 15th. The crew of the RZoyal yacht Victoria and Albert, Captain the Hon. Joseph D)enman, was turned over to her yesterday morning, and all hands are busy upon the Royal flotilla, to have it ready by the 15th, by 'which day also all gunboats and other craft, forming from 150 to 200 sail, are ordered to be at Spithead or in Portsmouth harbour. Lodgings, provisions, and pleasure craft are going up accordingly. Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Ducie Chads, ELC.B., left Portsmouth on Saturday for Queenstown, to hoist his flag as Commander-in-Chief of that naval station, vice Sir George Sartorious, promoted. The Alban steam tender left yes. terday with the new admiral's effects and domestic retinue. The Antelope, 3, steamvessel, Lieutenant Young, was going out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday to Woolwich to be paid off when she was signalled to anchor at Spithead, where she remains. The Comet steamtug arrived at Portsmouth yesterday forenoon, from Rye, with a new mortar vessel in tow. The Resolute steam transport yesterday afternoon embarked about 50 of the British German Legion for another station. The Devastation, 6, paddle sloop, Commander Marshall, had steam up and "blue Peter" flying, preparatory to leaving Spithead for Sierra Leone and the Cape of Good Hope, with the news of the peace, at 6 o'clock, last evening. The Eurotas, 12 guns, screw mortar ship, Captain William Moorsom, C.B., is under orders to be at Spithead on or before the 16th inst. Yesterday afternoon a detachment of sick and wounded r.on-commissioned officers and men from the Crimea, to the number of 46, reached Strood from Portsmouth, 'where they had disembarked from the steam transport which brought them home. On their arrival at the station a fatigue party of soldiers fromtheProvisional Battalion were inattendance, under the orders of AdjutantPope, who assisted the wounded men from the railway carriages. Second-class surgeon Wf. F. Fyffe, hLB., having made the usual medical exami. nation, those requiring further surgical treatment were removed to Brompton Hospital, and the remainder were taken to the invalid depOt, to await their discharge. The despatch boat Intrepid, No. l, was yesterday taken into the dry dock at Woolwich for the purpose of being subjected to the necessary overhaul. On a minute inspection and a partial stripping off the copper, it was ultimately discovered that the machinery was too cumbersome for that class of vessels, as the vibration occasioned by the working of the screw had caused leakages in that quarter. It was likewise found necessary to make an investigation of the stern, which resulted in the decision to adopt the plan pursued in a similar case on board a 4-gunboat, the Wrngler-namely, of fixing a layer of gun-metal plates on the outside of the ship's stern, by way of strengthening that portion of the vessel, which was ordered to be commenced w ithout delay. The gunboat Mistletoe, No. 46, arrived at Wooliich yesterday morning from Deptford, and has commenced shipping hersmall stores and ammunition. She will go down to Greenhithe to be swung to-morrow, and will proceed thence to the rendezvous at Portsmnouth. The gunboat Mastiff, No. 22, has completed her shipment of ammunition, rocket tubes, and other necessary stores, from the war depot at Woolwich Arsenal, and will sail iunmiediately for (Greenhithe. A large number of 'gun carriages and mortar beds were yesterday despatched from the carriage department at Woolwvich for the Arsenal at Portsmouth. The same system of diligent and persevering labour is continued both in Her Majesty's Dockyard and at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, nor is there the slightest appearance of any relaxation in the despatch employed in fitting out the gunboats and mortar 'doats. Four of the latter have received their 13-inch pieces of ordnance, and the three others are on the wharf ready to be hoisted on board. In some of the departments of the Arsenal the 'works are still carried on during the entire night.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMfES. Sir,--I enclose a letter, addressed to you, which I have juist received from the Count de Montalembert. Perhaps you will allow me to state that the translation of which he reasonably complains was, in point of fact, authorized by me on his behalf, in fill reliance on the distinct assurances of the highly respectable publisher that it was a very good one. I have since ascertained that, placing implicit confidence in the gentleman charged with the revision and editorship of the translation, Mr. Murray did not verify its correctness by comparison before publishing it. The editor's literary position and recognized acquirements certainly seemed to me to render superfluous, and even presumptuous, any demand on my part to be furnished bef-nehand with proofs of his competency or specimens of his performance; and his name, if made known, would go far towards relievingme from the responsibility of having too hastily sanctioned wvhat turns out to be little better than the travesty of a brlliant and thoughtful work. I remain, Sir, Your faithful and obedient servant A. HAYWARD. Temple, April 1. TO THE EDITOR OF TaE TIES. Sir,-The attention you have bestowed on my recent work De CAvenir Poilitque doe Angletr)crc induces me to trouble you with the following observations:- The translation of my book, published by 3fr. Murray, although authorized by me, has not been submitted to my revision, and after perusing it I must declare that I cannot acknowledge this translation as a true and faithful reproduction of nyessay. There is hardly a page in which the meaning of the original is notweaklened by useless expletives, or altered by unaccountable suppressions, or misrepresented by downright errors. I must therefore request all those who take any interest in the opinions of continental liberalism on the polity and politics of England to refer to the original, or to encourage some other translation. If you will kindly insert these few lines in your widely circulated columns you will greatly oblige your obedient I humble servant LE COMTE DE MO NTALEMBERT. Paris, March 3L
TALE PEAcE.-The Lord Provost of Edinburgh, being in London on Parliamentary business, telegraphed to the acting chief magistrate at a late hour on Sunday evening that tne treat-y of peace had been signed. Orders were given to ring the bells of the city churches in the morning, and from S a.mn. till noon on Monday they gave forth a merry peal. At noon a salute of 101 guns -was fired from the batteries of tbe Castle. At 12 o'clock the telegraphic despatches announcing the signature of -the treaty were read from the outer bcony of the Royal Rxchanpe, by ,a member of the College of Heralds, to an assemblage of 3,000 or 4,000 persons, who received the announcement with loud cheering. In the theatres in the evening the announcement of the peace was received with acclamation, and the national anthem was sung amid the usual demonstrations of loyalty. The city bells were again rang for some hours in the evening. The mayor of Leeds (Mir. T. W. George} has issued a notice, requesting that all public demonstrations of rejoicing at the peace should be deferred till the formal ratification of the treaty.
COUR-T OF ALDERMEN. THE EVWTLV EVEMEnlvn rCo3!m PTRA -r- Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public bnRin P Mr. Russell Gurney, who, at a recent Court of Common Council, was unanimously elected Common Serjeant, was sworn into office. TH EXECUTION OF BOUSFIELD. AldermanSI1nxrYsaid,-MyLordMayor, seeingthesheriffs present, I beg to ask them whether there is any truth in the statements that have appeared in the public journals of this morning regarding the execution of a criminal yesterday at the Old Bailey?7 It is reported that a great deal of what ws there seen arose from the nervousness of the hangman, which was produced by a threatening letter which he had previously received. I think it a matter of public duty that we should inquire into the whole of the circumstances attending this execution, in order thatwe may make a report as to the blame, if any, that ought to fall upon any personconnected with it. (Hear, hear.) I see from several of this mornings journals there is a great feeling in tho public mind respecting it, and certainly I never in my life read a more horrible account than the one which describes the exhi}-ition of yesterday. (HIear, hear.) Alderman and Sheriff Kicsxxnw.-The statement that has appeared in the public papers is a pretty faithful and aecurate account of what occurred at the execution at the Old Bailey yesterday morning. What the hon. gentleman has just mentioned did oocur-namely, that the executioner received a threatening letter, stating that he should be shot at; which certainly aled the mn. The prisoner was in a state of complete prostration; he was apparently ineapable of any exertion whatever; he was dressed by the officers of the prison; he couldnot walk, he could not stand; he was carried to the scaffold; he was placed in a chair for execution, and I believe it was the feeling of the executioner, as it was of everyone present, that he was more dead than alive and thoroughly incapable of any exertion. With that feeling, I believe, as well as under the alarm which he suffered, the executioner the moment he had drawn the bolt absolutely ran away, and he was not tobeseen-wedidnotknow what had become of him, and we had great difficulty to find him and bring him baek again. When the prisoner succeeded in placingeonvulsively his legs upon the top of the drop, they were removed,first, by one of the officers of the prison. It is a most lamentable occurrence, but I do not know that any one can be to blame. Of course the complete prostration of the prisoner did not suggest an idea that he had that physical power left that was capable of any struggle whatsoever. I believe that no one was to blame, excepting it may be said that the nervous agitation and alarm under which the executioner acted led to the lamentable occurrence. (Hear, hear.) Alderman SrDNsnY said, he thought the Court had but one duty to pursue, namely, to refer the matter to the Gaol Committee, because, if the statement of the sheriff were borne out, namely, that the executioner, in consequence of having received a tbreatening letter neglected his duty, it was very important that the Court should take cognizance of the fact. (Hear, hear.) Alderman Sidney then moved, "That the statement made by Alderman and Sheriff Kennedy respecting the execution of Bousfield be referred to the Gaol Committee, for them to inquire into the circumstances and to report to this Court." Alderman and Sheriff RoSa.-My Lord Mayor, I second that motion, and for this reason-I should not feel satisfied to carry out another execution with the man who officiated yesterday, if he were unassisted, because we were quite at his mercy; we depended entirelyupon him. It is not to be supposed that we could have the gallows out and all tried and arranged beforehand. (Hear, hear.) We depended entirely upon this man, and at the last moment we found that he was utterly and totally incapable of carrying outthe duty that he had undertaken. (Hear.) Whether it arose from his being frightened by this letter, or whether he depended upon the prisoner being past all exertion, Ido not know, but I could not get him to come forward at alL Sir P. I~Kunrn thanked the sheriffs for the pradence with whiclc they had stated the case, and which he believed was not at all exaggerated. Alderman KsraEDnY-There is no doubt of the fact that such a letter was sent to the hangman. It was sent to the g. ol; we saw the letter. Sir C. MASti A said that, as one of the visiting magistrates to the city prisons, it was his melancholy duty to be pi esent at the gaol ofjewgate onSanday, and he could bear testimony to the great anxiety manifested by the governor, MJr. Weatherhead, to do everything that lay in his power in order that the wretched criminal might be supported and sustained till the hour of execution arrived. He could assure the Court that not only the chaplain and medical man but also the gaol attendants whose duty it was tosit up with the prisoner had properly discharged theirduty. (He, The motion was carried unanimously. TE OFFICE OF CITY BRO1ER. Alderman SIDNEY moved,- " That Mr. Solicitor lay before this Court at its next sitting a statement in writing of the origin for licensing brokers to act in the city of London; whether the same is based on customary usage and recognized by statutable enactments; and, futher, if this Court can legally enforce payment of any arrears ofrentfrom persons licensed to act as brokers, and has power to compel others acting in a like capacity to become duly licensed; also, to report upon the wording of the bond required to be entered into by sworn brokers, and if it be within the province of this Court to revise the same by substituting any other form in lieu thereof." Alderman SnxsvY said, he knew of no opposition to the motion, except two views which had been expressed by one or two- members of the Court. One was that, as the Government had given notice of their intention to introduce a bill into Parliament upon the subject, such a motion was somewhat premature; the other, that it might endanger the revenues of the city derived from brokers' rents. He took it for granted that, whether it endangered the revenues of the city or not, it was not for the Court, as magistrates sitting in a judicial capacity, to troubl6 their heads upon that subject. The words over the door, "Audi alteraei partenc," were the motto upon which the magistrates of the city of London had always acted - and he was quite satisfied that, although there might be a diversity of opinion upon questions in that court, there was not a diversity of opinion in respect to their judicial character and dutv in acting uprightly and puttng the law in force; and not only that, but having an equal regard for not overstepping that which the law gave them power to carry out. (Hear.) With respect to the objection, that a bill was onthe eve of being introduced into Parliament upon the subject of licensing brokers, he took it for grantedt tfiat te Comt had no right to notice that in any way whatever. Whatever it might be in the wisdom of Parliament to do w,ith the ancient institutions of the city, it was not for the Court to inquire into at that moment. They had a duty to perform, andhe trusted that the Court would support him in getting the returns asked for by the motion. He had been in communication with a great many brokers, and might state both his own and their opinion, that the regulations in existence, if wisely considered and strictly enforced, would tend considerably to the public welfare - but it was much to be regretted that on a subject of such vital importance, and one in respect to which the corporation had for many years derived many thousands of pounds per annum, they should show sucic laxity in carrying out what the public demanded so frequently of themnamely, justice to the class of persons dealing in the capacity of brokes. (Hear, hear.) Sir P. LAUIE rose to order, and said he considered the Court would not be acting discreetly if it desired the City Solicitor to furnish the information sought by the motion. The LORD 3AYoR said, Alderman Sidney was perfectly in order. Sir P. LAurIE then moved that the Court be counted. The LORD MAYOR said, there were more members pro*ent than were necessary to constitute a Court. Aldenman SIDNEY then continued.-He was very sorry for the interTuption. His remarks would be very brief, but they were really very important, and concerned the character of the Court in a very great degree. He certainly was not prepared to find a man who in his judicial character was so enlightened as Sir P. Laurie oppose a motion of that kind. He (Aldernan Sidney) sought for infornation. He preferred to know the law rather than to grope in darkness; and he therefore asked the Court to cause to be furnished to them a clear statement of the law upno the case from their legal adviser, the City Solicitor. e took it for granted that a custom which had been in force ever since the time of Edward I. was based upon legal grounds. It was a custom which had been recognized in a great many statutes in the time of William LI., in the time of Anne, and in the time of George III. If the custom of licensing brokers were good for the public at large (and he believed it was so), then the Court ought to make it uniform, and all those acting in the city-whether as stock and exchangebrolkers,whetherin the large tenm of colonial brokers, whether as ship brokers and agents-every person who undertook a brokerage or commission business ought to be bound by the same laws which bound the rest of their brethren. (Hear, hear.) It was right to say that there was wide-spread dissatisfaction among the more honourable brokers in the city; and he was not surprisedat itsbecause, although the rent was not objected to, still the terms of the bond were soabsurd and so unjust that they really were never acted upon, while the Court required every gentleman who entered into the business of a broker to came before them and solemnly to call God to vitness that he would act upon the bond. He (Alderman Sidney) bad the authority both oraliy and in writing of a gentleman at the head of his own trade-Mr. Thompson-to say that, whatever it might cost his (Mr. Thompson?s)house and the trade, theyweredeterminednever more to subscribe to the wording of the bond. Take the case of a "entleman in a lucrative business who had got the surplus of'his capital to invest-Mr. Thompson, as a broker, according to the present regulation, coud not conscientiously inves the surplus of his gains either in a joint-stock bank or in any article of merchandise whatever, because he happened to be abroker, and the reulationofthe Courtwent tothisextent-thatifhewere knov;ntobeadealerinanyway whatever further than a broker he was liable to be expunge;d from the list of brokers andl under the penalty of losing his character and his business. (Henr, hear.) Again, if a broker wished to invest money through another broker, it was impossible that he could have freedom of intercourse. Alderman Sidney, having alluded to what he considered other hardships imposed by the present regulations, said there was scarcely a house in London where more than one member of a finn was recognized as a sworn broker, and he would undertake to say that in the house ofwhich he had spokenthere were at least a score of gentlemen acting every day of their hveswas sornbrokers ought to do by the terms 4 fthe bond. He therefore took it for granted that the bond required alteration-it required adaptation to the present times. (Hear, hear.) He also took it for granted that the Court was anxious to know what : uthoritythey had in so important a matter as that of licensing brokvers in such an important canital as the city of london, which derived some ;5,00%t per annum by means of SCt. each paeid by a certain number of brokers. He believed he was understating the sum when he said that, if all persons who acted as brokers in the city were duly licensed and paid 51, each per annum, the total would not amount to~ lsthn25,OOOl. per annum, which would be paid into the revenues of the city. He'did' not offer an opinion as to whether they were entitled to receive 51., or only the ancient fee of 2?. By the 57th of George m,I a com- promise waS made in respect to the ofice of wine gauger of the city, and, inasmuch as the Gover;a- i ment of that day abolished that office in the person of the Lord Mayor, they allowed the sum for a brokerf license to be raised from 27 to 51H He thought he had made out a case to justify the Court in asking for a return, not only of the origint of brokers' rents, but also of the power which the Court had-whether to enforce p2ymaent of the rents, whether to call upon gentlemen acting as brokers who had not been licensed to be duly licensed as brokers, and to consider the terni of a bond which, to sav the least of it, was of a very extraordinuaT nature, as it called upon gentlemen to perform an act which every dav of their lives they were compelled to violate. (Hear, ]iesr. AUderman }?~, in seconding the motion, said, that a very large number of his constituents were deeply interested in the question, feeling that they could not ponlbly conscientiously tikce the oath. The motion wras negatived, and the Court adjourned.
I THE ROYAL COLLEGfE OF PHYSICAMS. TO THE EDITOl OF THE TDEM. Sir,-Though reluctant to answer an anonymous cores,pondent, I Perceive in the last paragraph but one in a letter slged S.T. ."in your paper of to-day, an aspers;.on on the College of Physicians which, as treasu;rer of that institution, I feel bound to notice. I shall show the injustice of that aspersion bythe tatement of a few facts on which your correspondent is man mestly snisinformed. Mr. Headlam's bill would not very materially enrich the college, because the bill does not require that physicians now practising as such should necessarily become members. The existing law requires that all physicians practising in london shall be licensed by the college; the new bill leaves this enactment as it is, and only further requires the same law to extend to physicians throughout the country, a certain proportion of whom are already licensed by the college. The modified support which the fellows of the college are disposed to afford Mr. Headlam's measure proceeds from the liberal and unselfish desire of attaining some settlement of the question which may be beneficial to the profession throughout all its branches The sarcasm in "S. T. 3's" letter on the poverty and fallen dignity of the college is as unfounded as it is uncourteous, The extensive influence of the College of Physicians has suffered no deterioration in the present generation. Its finances were never, since the first granting of the charter by Henry VIII., in a better condition than at this moment. It is not necessary here to state the income or its expenditure. The income is sufficient. Its expenditure is wholly applied to the legitimate purposes anticipated by the Royal founders. I may specify, however, that the noble building in Trafalgar-square was erected almost wholly by private subscription by the fellows, within the last 30 years, at a cost of nearly 30,0001.; and also that one-half of the present income of the college is derived from property bequeathed to it by varous physicians out of their own landed and personal estates. The president and fellows of the college would, I am persuaded, not feel disposed to contend with an anonymous wrter about the pride of their establishment; hut that the college is fullfilling the purposes of its foundation, promoting science, and sustaining the dignity of a learned body, enjoying at the same time funds ample for such important purposes, I am fully qualified to assert. I have the honour to be. Sir. vour obedient servant~ .TA?T. ATnPrPRR T-?T iRSt< Treasmrer of the Royal College of Physicians. IMar~ch 27.
TO TEB EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As you have stated " that it is impossible not to eontrast the solemnity of the Royal Confirmation with the ordinary administration of the rite in large and populous dioceses," Ibeg that the following statement may be allowed to appear in The Ti?ns, showinghowconfirmat.ons are conducted in the diocess of Oxford. The Bishop of Oxford confirms in each of the three counties which compose his diocess-viz., Berks, Bucks, and Oxon, once in three years. This year he has confirmed in the county of Bucldngham. The number of parishes and districts in the county are, according to the Clergy Lis,? 19S. The numbers confirmed this year in the county are 4,500. The places at which confirmations were advertised to be held are 51. This gives an average of less than four parishes assembled at each confirmation, and less than 81 persons to be confimed ; and if from these averages a few of the very small parishes be takenwhere more than four are brought together, and some of the large town parishes where from 100 to 200 were confirmed belonging to the town, it maybe seen that for the most part less than four parishes are assembled, and less than 80 persons areconfirmed at anyone place; a number not more than sufficient to give solemnity to the service. I am satisfied that a large number of persons might be brought forward to testify to the solemn character of the service of confirmation as administered in this diocess, and I feel confident that this statement will prove to all candid minds that, in this diocess at least, the bishop cannot be open to any censure for the way in which he conducts his confirmations. On the contrary, I believe it is hardly possible that they could be conducted so as to produce a deeper imprecsion on those who are presented for the Apostolic ite of laying on of hands. I may also add that the Bishop of Oxford is always ready to go to any parish where the clergyman wishes for a confinnation if 20 candidates are ready for the celebration of that rite. I remain Your obedient servant. CHARLERS TT.OVT) A Rmal Dean of the Diocess oT Oxford. March 31.

tEDicAL LSIsLATow.-Yesterday four deputations of medical men-consisting of Dr. O'Connor, of per Montagu-street; Dr. Leet, of Dublin; and Dr. 1aclean, representing graduates of medicine; Professors Syme and Balfour, of Edinburgh; and Dr. Laurie, Professor of Surgery, Glasgow ; Drs. Wood and Begbie, from the CoUege of Physicians, Edinburgh; and Drs. Paris and Hawkins, from the CoUege of Physicians, London-accompaniedby MIr. A. Black, LP., Mr. Grogan, M.P., and lMr. Oliveira, ALP., had each an interview with Sir George Grey, lMr. Cowper, M.P., President of the Board of Eealth, and Mr. Massey, ILP., Under Secretary of State, at the Home-office, on the subject of MIr. Headlam's bill for the regulation of the medical profession. Dr. O'Connor, on behalf of the first deputation, said they were desirous of seeing the two princi]les of the bill become law which insisted on a uniformity of qualification among all medical men before admission to practise throughout the Umited kingdom, and a registration of all duly qualified practitioners; but the profession at large and a majority of the existing medical corporations were opposed to the mode of representation in the Council sought to be established by the measure, tending, as it might, to introduce political discord or agitation among the members of the profeson, which, as diverting them from the properbusiness of their vocation, was especiaUy to be deprecated. A greater amount of sui?nort from the profession would be shown towards the bill if the Government were to take into their own hands the nomination of at least three-fourths of a council of 12 for the government of the profession, of which six ought to be medical men, three laymen of high position, and the remaining three elected by the existing medical corsDrations of the metropolis, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin, witb a sub-council for each of the three parts of the kingdom. He also held that the bill ought to have recoganized the incontrovertible fact that the knowledge of pharmacy was as essential to the practitioner as that of medicine and surgery, purely considered, and thatthe genuineness of drugs was as necessary to success inmedical treatment as the knowledge of medicine itself. They es?ecially objected to clause 21 of the bil, under whien, as it stood, those who were simply graduates in medicine would not be admitted to registration. If that clause passed in its present shape, the venerable Dr. Headlam, of Newcastle, the uncle of the author of the bill, and Sir Charles Hastings, of Worcester, would be disqualifed frompractisng as physicians, eminent as they hadlongbeenassueh* and of the 2,500 graduates of medicine in the British and Irish Universities now in England none would be permitted to register as physicians, however well qualified. He also contended that the bill if passed in its inteority, would establish an amount of centralization wholly foreign to much of the present spirit of legislaton. Dr. Leet, of Dublin, complamed that by the bill as it stood the apothecaries of that city, who were subject to a strict examination by physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries before being admitted into the profession as generalpractitioners, would be denied the privilege of registration, the effect of which would be to lower the status of a highly qualified and respectable body of men, and to degrade them in public estimation. He contended, too, that it would be a retrograde step in medical legislation to degrade chymistr- and pharmacy from the position they had ever held, with reference to medicine and surgery, among all the enlightened nations of Europe, inasmuch as they lay at the very foundation of medical science, and therefore deserved a distinct recognition in a bill of this kind. Professor Syme, on the part of the second deputation, said they were decidedly opposed to the constitution of the council on the pirinciple of uriversal suffrage, and they also objected to the bill, on the ground that it would not recognize the degrees of Universities as affording any qualification for practice, and that the system of registration proposed byit only contemplated a division of the profession into two classes, which division did not at present exist. He said, in reply to Sir G. Grey, that they objected to the bil altogether. The simplest system of medical legislation, he added, would be to allow all the present boards, whether lUniversities or corporations, to grant a license to practise, provided they -were each compelled, by the superintendence of a medical council appoin by.the Crown. to bring up the education and examination of their candidates to a mu form standard. The deputation from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh stated in effect that they were sincerely anxiouls that the present anomalous state of the profession should be, at once remedied, that they had repeatedly urged the necessity for that on the attention of the Lgislature, and that they would therefore rather accept Mr. Headlem's bill as it stood than run any risk of longer post pouing medicalreform by objecting to its details They pointed out a fed of the defects of the bill as they appeared to them, and suggested certain remedies. The deptation from the CoUege of Physicians of Londonhad also an opportunity of stating their views in. reference to the measure. Sir George Grey thanked the several deputations for the expression of their opinions of the bil1, put a few questions on pointg left in doubt by tijem, but did not state the 6ourse he intended to take with respect to it, nor was he asked to do EO.
THE BISHOP OF BAro?R. TO TE EDITOR OF TEI1 -TIMS. Sir,-Aniadmirable article which reoently appeaed in our columns, upon the outrageous letters of the TBishop of ngorto the fon. W. Owen Stanley, threatemng prosecation in the Court of Arches and all sorts of anm pernalties tobeinfficted upon every clergyman wh should dare to sign a petition for additional services in any church in the diocess of Bangor, has excited great interest in the. principality. Bat, though it is by no means intended to take thepartof theBishopof Bangor,orto justifyhlsconduct; yet Iam sare you will not refuse insertion to the 'following facts, hichay plead a little in extenuation of the con duct of that right rev. prelate. The Bishop of Bangor states that he is 83, and that he cannot, therefore, expect his escopate to continue much longer. That episcopate has ]ready lasted a very considerable number of years, dunng the coarse of which time the Bishop of R or has beer invariably held up as the most praiseworthy o.all the four bihGs or Wales, in consequence of his havnr many more Welsn services performed in the churches ol his dioees than had ever been enforced by his right rev. brethren in' the three other diocesses of the rincpality. To show that the Bishop of Bangor really was by eom-' parison a shining light, the following summary of statistics is sub.oined,wherein the church services are extracted from a Par. entary paper sent in by the Bishops of Liandaff, St. David's, St. Asaph, and Bangor, in the years 1849 an.t 1850, to which are added the statistics of the dissenting places of worship in the same parishes. LlandafE-In 128 parishes there are 1.62 churches, in which are p rovided only 91 Welsh services; while in the same 128 painshes there are S39 places of Dissentint arship, with 558 Welsh Sunday services, and 554 tVelslh weekly services, being a total of 1,112 Welsh serices provided in every seven days by the Dissenters for the natives. St. David's.-In 85 parishes there are 98 churches, in which are 131 Welsh unday services. Daissentin places of worship in the same,parishes, 410, vith 891 Wesh Sunday services and 58 %'elth weekly services, being a total St. .Asaph.-ln 85 parishes are 98 churches, vwith 13 Welsh Sunday services. In the same 85 narishes arc 410 Dissenting places of worship, lvth 891 WethSunday services and Welsh weeldy services, being a total of 1,475 Welsh services provided by the Dissenters for the natives. Bangor.-In 18 parishes, with 24 churches, are 43 Welsh Sunday services. In the same parishes w ere 65 places of Dissentingy w orship, with 172 WVelsh Sunday services ancd 108 We weekily services, being a total of 280 services provided in these 18 parishes by the Dissenters for tho natives. In conclusion, it is only necessary to remark that, how. ever miserable the provision for the church appears by the side of the provision made by the Dissenters of Wales, yeti it must be alloweed that the Welsh Sunday services in the diocess of Bangor are beyond all proportion great when compared with those of the other dliocesses. The united incomes of the four bishops of Wales amount to 16,900?. per annum, while the amount of their services to the natives of the countrywhence they derive this enormous emolunent is to provide 417 paishes wvith 373 Welsh services, while the unpaid Welsh Dissenters provide 3,650 Welsh services for the same localities..

TEA yBL NOT ON THE FiBRS OF THE MONTAr.

LINTE CANTEETNS ANB MAJIyE CAAVTEENS TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIES. Sir,-The whole of the Line canteens are placed under tho control of the Ordnance Department, and very recently an alteration for the comfort of the soldier has taken plsce with respect to the letting of them. Tenants are selected by the Ordnance authorities, and each tenant has to pay a rent of frorm 10Z. to 15. per annum, according to the sizo of the canteen. The articles sold at the cauteens must be of a good gualty and at a price chosen by the authorities, which price is also placarded in a conspicuous part ; and, if such is not complied with by the tenaut, he vill very soon find a successor; therefore, by the above improvement, the Line soldier can obtain his pot of London porter for 3.d., and his ale for 5d., and all other articles according to mairket prices as nearly as possible. But not so with Poor Joe the Marine, the tables are turned upon him, he has to put up with what he can get, and pay through the nose for it. But why is this? Simply because the canteens are not placed on a footing -with the Line canteens, and are let at such an enormous rent that the tenant has te fleece poor Joe unmercifully to scrape his rent together. Poor Joe has to pay 4d. for his pot of porter, and 6d. for his ale, and for every other article in lke proportion, all of which are inferior to those sold at the Line canteens ; therefore if the services of a marine be regarded as equal to the Line soldier, why should he not have the same indulgence when on shore as his brethren, for it is well known that he gets fleeced enough when abroad. It would hardly be credited that one of the 3Iarine canteens pays the enormous rent of 600. per annmn; therefore by this it will be shown that if the tenant were to do justce to the soldier, be could not pay such a rent when the arack-s only contain between 300 and 400 men when Theseare Admiralty canteens, and the soonertheyara placed on a footing with the Line the better Ponr .Tn, arn1 A ;AIALNE CANTEET TENANT. nRe it.
Tn: LumBE TR&ADE OF 3lICBGAXN.-Very few people have an adequate idea of the immense extent to which the lumber trade of this State has grown within the few past years. It is still within the memorv of most of our young men when the forests of Michigan had never echoed to the sound of the woodman's axe, and when her rivers yet dashed on unobstructed by races, floodgates, and dams, and when the busy hum of the engine had never driven a saw within the limits of the State. The pineries of St. Clair, Saginaw, Grand River, Flint, and Lapeer stll towered heavenward, and their monarchs still waved their plumed heads in grandeur. Bnt the wave of emirgration gathered force with each succeeding year, and enterprise and adventure rode upon its crest. Hardy frontier men sought out new homes beyondcivilization. lunters followed the retiring game westward, and greedy speculators sought out fictitious locations for imaginary ci.ties and villages, and sold visionary squares for their ideal surveys. Real purchasers of unreal tracts of land stole in silently one after another, and the vilderness began to put on the show and semblance of busy, bustling life. }Farms wavedtheirfields of golden grain where but a short time before the thick-set wood had made a hiding place for the wild beasts. Towns grew up, cities full armed in commercial dress sent out the echo of their busy lifo in every portion of the State. Everv river *vas obstrcted at every possible point with mills. The monarch of the forest fell before the axe of the woodman, and even the dense I forestwas swarmingwithenergyandlabour. Butsogradual I has the change come that it has not been noted ; and where observation is turned to this subject astonishment is the absorbing emotion. It is not strange that the uncultivated forests of Michiganshould yield her an income of $3,500 000 per annum. The calculation may seem incredible, bu it Is susceptible of demonstration. We have exported to Chicago soniething over300,000,000 feet of lumber, about 100,000,000 feet to Wisconsin, leaving only 100,000,000 feet for home consumption, which is a very low estimate. This lumber comes from Saginaw, lapeer, St. Clair, Fint, and Grand River; in St. Clair County something over 50,000,000 feet of lumber during the past year, all of which, except 9,000,000 feet, has been sold at an average of about $11 per 1,000, which would make an aggregate value of $451,000. In Saginaw and vicinity the cut has been much larger, as the mills are more numerous and the faclities greater. A careful estimate for that region is set down at 105,507,770 feet, which has sold atan avor2geof $10 ,per 1,000, making an aggregate of $1,055,077. We iavo not been able to secure the staisties of this tradein lapeer, lint, and Grand River for the presentyear, but, setting them down at about last years figures, we shall have an aggregate of n pards of $2,00D,COD, which, added to the actual estimates above, give a total of $3,500,000. But, if i*1 tor tionsof thepineries have duringthepast ycarincre`sedthea r busines6 asmuch as Saginaw and S'. Clair, this sum must be swelled to upwards of $5,000,000. So much for the vetc almost undeveloped wealth of Mfichigan.
