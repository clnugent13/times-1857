MOAVjY.MARBKTard CIlYYZTEBLLIGENCE. Tha Egnliaii funds have comp!eb e ec from the depression of yesterday, and, alt,ough the transactions to-day ha-e not been e:tenaive, the market has presented an appearale",, of great general firmness. uonsols for money -which left off last evening at 9a0 to i, wl' -e'6 tquedto s, whenoe theY stedilMY a' " :~ to quto J twi they remained to J a official close. At alater hour the feeling Of ark 4tion increased, and finally there Were bU61'oS fr,oney at 91, while for the account the lateEt barga;a -were at 911 to J. Somo Moaney urches dfri g the day tended to create stability, but the chief causes of the improvement were the satisfactor character of the Bank returns, the arrval of Australian gold, better prices from the rec Pourse, and the statement that approaching conferences will be held in P".ris, and that Baron Brnnow, who was .dlinister in England from the Court of St. Petersburg up to the commencement of the war, has been I nominated to take part in them on behalf of Russia. Bank Stock was quoted209 to 210; Re- , toa; New Three per Cents, 91; Long Annuities, 3i; Annuities, 1885, 16 9-16; India Stock, 218 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, i97 to 98; and india-bonds and Exchequer-bills, 6s. to 2s. discount. In foreign secuities there has been little activity, and prices have shown rather less buoyancy. At the commencement of business increased sales caused a decline, but there was ultimately a recoverv. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions for the account were at 91, 90W, 911, and j. The Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock was negotiated at 1021 and J, and it closed at about that quotation. The general operations comprised-Chilian Six per Cents., 104; Ecuador, 5i ; the New Consolidated, 149 and 14; Greek, 6 ; Peruvian, for account, 80; Portuguese Four per Cents., for account, 47A; Spanish New Deferred, for account, 23 and 224; Venezuela, for account, 28 and 28&; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64j. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 90c. for money and 69f. 15he for the account, showing a recovery of a-half per cent. The Vienna prices confirm the sudden improvement in that market. At Anisterdam there has been rather less finrness. The telegraphic advices from China to-day reach to the 15th of December, and report a further advance in the rates of exchange, calculated to stimulate increased shipments of silver from this side. At Hongkong the quotation, which was previously 4s. l0d., had risen to 4s.1.Ols, w hile at Shanghai it had gone from 6s. 7id. to 6s. 9-'.d The export of silk to date had been 22,600 baYes, and prices were low er, the quality being inferior. The accounts from Melbourne state that the next vessels to leave were the Shalimar, which would sail in a fortnight, and the James Baines in a month, and that it was expected each would take as much gold as the Champion of the Seas. From Sydney the advices on this occasion mention that the Bank of New South Wales has been appointed agent in this country for the sale of 900,0001. Five per Cent. Govermment Debentures, secured on land, for the purpose of carrying out public improvements. Business was very languid, and confidence much shaken by the heavy failures which continued daily to take place. Several overdue ships from England had arrived. The recent exports of gold had merely comprised 370 oumces and 100 sovereigns by the Lord Burleigh and another vessel. The railwvay meetings of the week have not been numerous; but they present some facts of interest. It appears from the report of the North Staffordshire directors that every effort has failed to induce the London and North-WVestern board either to satisfy the claim of the company or to put their case in train for settlement. The dividend declared at the t7lster meeting was 28s. per share, free from income-tax, leaving a balance of 4,0001. tobe carried to the reserved fund. The report of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshiro Companyv has been adopted, including the guaranteed and other dividends. The directors of the Middlesborougl and Guisborough line have declared a dividend at the rate of 41p per cent. per annumn iunder the working agreement with the Stockton and Darlington Company. At the Swansea Vale mneeting the report of the directors was adopted, the progress made having been considered satisfactory. It is expected that thle Leorainster and lKington line will be opened in July, and an arrangement has been made with the contractors by which a clear dividend of 4 per cent, will be paid to the shareholders. The specie arrivals of the week have been almost limited to the 500,0001. announced yesterday from Australia, the greater part of which is expected to be sent to France. Among the legal facts of the past week has been the expression of an opinion by the Coiut of Queen's Bench that railway companies are liable for damaaes caused by misrepresentations in their time-tables. In the same court also judgment has been given in favour of a claim by a wharfinger against an assurance company for customers' goods burnt after they had been landed on his premises. The plea was that he had no insurable interest in such goods; but the words of the policy included " -oods in trust or in commission." In the Court of 'Bankruptcy, in the case of Strahan and Paul, a decision was given against a petition that certain shares in the Sambre Mining Company among their assets should be treated as a special security against 10,2951. of trust propertymisappropriated by Strahan, and belonging to his brother. EIe never transferred themu or gave notice of their being trust securities; but merely, as he states, placed them in his desk with an endorsement. Inthiscourt likewise a petitionfromGordon, of thefirmofDavidsonandGordon, thatthe adjudication in bankruptcy might be armulled or a day fixed for his surrender, was dismissed. HÂ£e isnowin prison for twro years, but further prosecustions against the finm by the city authorities are pending, and are fixed for the 4th of next month. Should these result in a verdict of guilty, the punishment, it is stated, wil be much more severe. The South Australian (BuriaBurra) MEningAssa. ciation have transmitted their half-yearly report through Messrs. James MIorrison and Co., their London agents. It appears that the success of the operations which were resumed in Maylast has been very great, and that the percentage of copper obtained from the ore raised has been higher, upon the average, than any previously obtained. The assets of the company showed an estimated sum of 62,0001. for distribution among the shareholders,and dividends were accordingly to be resumed on the 1st of Dlecember. The following are from Australian mining conipanues:- PorT PurtIP AN-D COLOXAL. "The directors have received advices from their resident director at M1elbourne to the 25th of October. He forwards bill of ladin' for 1 tons l5cwt of tin ore, and 1S3oz. of gold in two %ars, shipped per Champion of the Seas, the produce of the company's establishment at the Ovens; also, a box of samples of tin ore. He also transmits Mr. ThompsoI's report on the quartz bands at Mount Blachkwood gold7felds and at Mount Egerton, and adds - 'M1r. Thompson will leave this week to examine the quartz veins recently discovered uear Geelong, at a place called Steigletz. I have suggested to him the expediency of securing, if possible, acaim on some quartz vein he may consider ehl,ible, and employ upon it a sufficient number of men to retaiu possession of it, leavin the cquestion of machineryfor crushing and amalgamating, for the present, til the value of the claim has been proved and the board have had time to send out further instructions with reference to future operations; at the same time anything decidedIy advantageous in this branch of nunrg I s not hesitate to enter into without delay.' With respect to the tin ore he remarks,-' The whole of this nas been shipped by this vessel, and I hope it will realize a price in accordance with the assay. That raised by Mr. Thompson I felt compelled to estract the gold from here, owing to the extreme bneness of the gold, which was lkely to be partially lost in the bags, and the variabl.eness of thequality rendering it impossble to give a fair average sample; some $ags.averaged as low as 203 ounces per ton, and t wosmall lots gave at the rate of 350 ounces per ton.)"'

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Saturday Evening. In the railway-market there was some little heaviness during the morning, but prices subsequently recovered, and showed.a further tendency to improvement. AU the leading descriptions were firm at the close. Few transactions took place in the shares of the Australian land and banking cornpanies, but quotations were fairly suipported. Canada Land closed 131 to 136, and Crystal Palace atoi.Mining securities wqere generally neglected.

RAILWAYlZNTTELLIGEZNB. 3DfnBRGIT P A;RT) MD DDE AND S0ffvfCE N{TRAL A Wsrking agreement has been provisdonally entered into between the directors of these companies, subject to the approval of the shareholders. It is tated that the ,greemnent is founded on the retniti Oft'ste Paa expeAence of worklng the traffio of both Oompanies, and with a view to extinguish competition, and thus save a large and unprofitable expenditure by both companies, in the running ot aouble trains, for the purpote oQf P o n Zd mnain the same dEcRCntoih of traffic. ytle pioposed arrsnc inent they allege that greater eocoininodation will afforded to the public than has hitherto been the case from the separate working of the two railways. Tbh proposed working agreement provides for the working of the two undertakings ander one management. The mnanagement is to be conducted by a joint committee, consisting of five members from each board of direction, who are to be nominated annually. The committee are to managethetraffic, and to maintain the undertakings and plent of both comnpanies in a thorough stato of efficiency. Inventories of the plant of both companies are to be made out, and theplant valued within a fixed period; and arbiters are to report from time to time on the state and condition of the two undertakings, -ad on the plant. Each company is to contribute its proportion of working stock, and the company providing an excess over that proportion is to be credited with interest on its value. The average amount of the gross revenues of each company for the two years ending with January, 1856, is to be ascertained, and to form the bases of division of the future gross revenues of the two companies. The working expenses are to be divided into certain fixed proportions, regulated by the past expenditure of each company. The taxes, feu duties, and other special burdens are to be borne by each company separately, and also each company is to be separately liable for its own mortgages, debts, interests, &c. It is also arrangedthat all heritable and other property not required for the managementofthe trafficis to remain the separate property of each company. Subsisting agreements with other companies are also to be maintained. It is stipulated that an application to Parliament shall be made in the session of 1857 for power to ratify the agreement, which is intended to last for a period of ten years, with an obligation on the two companies to renew the same for another ten years. Six mouths prior to the expiration of theagreement any deficency in the state of the plant and works is to be made good out of the then eurnent half-year's revenue. In case of dispute as to the construction of the agreement the ma. tter is to be referred to arbitration. The directors of the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Company have entered into a working agreement with the promoters of the Rinrossshire Railway, upon similar terms to those contained in the agreement with the St. Andreves Railway Company, which has worked satisfactorily and advantageously for both complanies.

The arrivals of foreign wheat, flour, and Indian corn, sinee Tuesday, are scanty. This is also the case from Irelaud and coastwise. A considerable quantity of wheat and flour on passage from America is reported a total loss. Prnies since Tuesday, have assumed more regularity; stiU there has been little passing in any article of the tra,doe the question of peace or sear appears to hold prices in the balance. The market yesterday was not so good as was auticipated, the pretensions of holders of wheat, and flour being above buyers' views, and they seem to have ability to keep aloof for the present. Tuesday's prices were exceedod, but the general demand mwasslowincharacter. Quotationsare scarcely reliable, and to-day we have had only a feeble demand. NOTTINGAM, JAw. 26.

ADMIN TSATIPE REFORBM ASSOCA. TION. FALL OF KARS. On Saturday a public meeting was held in the large room e 'Te London TaTern, under the auspices of the Admj. makativetefona Association, to take intoconsideration tho rcumstances connected with the fall of Kars. The room ws wel1 filled, and on the platform was a considerable mumler of the members and friends of the association, awlng whom wee Mr. A. PeDatt, M.P., Mr. W. S. aindsay, 31.P., Mr. Tite, M.P., 3Mr. S. Morley, Mr. Vassiot, Mr. Ingram Travers, &c. The chair was, on the voionof Mr. A.Pellatt, 3LP., taken by Mrr. S. Morley. It was announcedthatletters of excuse fornon-attendance Lad been received from Sir J. Duke, ALP., Mr. W. SWillUiaas, hLP., and Baron Rothschild, M.P. Baron 3tbtschild stated that he fully agreed iu the utility oi the cteeting being held, and the necessity that existed for some Â£ncquiry being made into the unfortunate circumstances con- eckd with the full of Ears. The CHAÂ£YN, in opening the business, said, objections Wad been raised to the calling of the present meeting with Ieference to the capitulation of Ears; and he was anxious, at the outset, to state that they. had been called together iunply to demand inquiry. (Hear, hear.) They were not there to attack any abaent man-to condemn any one unheard, but to state that facts of a grave nature had been narrated- to them by parties some of whom had them. selves been connected with the very transactions to irhich reference would be made (hear), General Beatson becing one of those parties. It would be shown that numerous aud pressing despatches had been sent by General Williams to our Ambassador at Constantinople, entreating that relief night be sent to the fortress of Ears; but that, though enerals and soldiers-thousands of whom had been lying for months idle-petitioned that they might be sent to Cam out this relief, and *11 this months before the arrival of that season of the year when it is impossible to transport artillery, or move an army with effect in that districtof coutry, yet no succour was provided for the fortress of Sars. ("H Hear, hear," and " Shame!") Now, it might be that the real delinquent was elsewhere than at Constanti. cople. (Cheers.) Without giving an opinion on that point, they Were prepared to submit to Her Majesty a memorial camly and dispassionately setting forth the facts of the Case, andrequesting that afull and searching inquiry should be made into all the circumstances. (Cheers.) The AdmiCtirative Reform Association had been charged with referMing only to delinquencies exhibited in the minor appoint. Inents in the variousdepartments. Now, it wasunquestion. ably the fact that the lower departments of the State were filled with inefficient persons, owing to the impure process iSy which the appointments were made; but they were prepAred to say that in the higher departments of the State the same impure process as goinr on (cheers) and they believed that in an instance like the present, 'where there was a frinzdfeae case made out, they were clearly in the path <of duty when they asked the publiec to unite with them in demanding an inquiry, with a view to the removal of so great a calamity. (Cheers. There was a growing convic- tion on the part of many tlat our diplomatic and consular I arrar.gesnents were such as greatly to interfere with the interests of this country (cheers); that the principle on which the appointments were made was enornonsly wrong, and that something should be done to set it right. (Cheers.) :He would only referto an appointment recentlynmade, for a temporary purpose, no doubt, but bearing on a matter of the greatest moment-he meant the sending of the Duke of Cambridge to the Council of War held at Paris. (Hear.) MEe appealed to any thinlangman in that room whether, if cue-half of the statements made in the public press regard. ing the Duke of Cambridge were true, that individual would have been sent to the conference if he had not been - duke. fCheers.) These were things which the people should think about and discuss, and it was to excite attention towards them and lead every individual to feel that ho could do something towards altering a system that was ruining the country that this association had been instituted. Cheers.) They were told that to move on the present occason was inopportne, because the House af Commons was about to meet. (" Oh, oh !") Now, hoe would frankly state that, for himself, he had vei4 little faith in the House of Commons (cheers), but at all events the House of Commons would do their work all the znore efliciently if they knew that earnest men were meeting and exposing these evils to the condemnation of the country. Niear, hear.) A memorial had been prepared which would be read by the secretary, and for the state tcents contained in that memorial those who prepared it held themselves responsible. Before concluding he wished to make one or two remarks as to the main objects of the nissociation. There might be a feeling of great mdifference on the subject of Admiinistrative Reform, but there could be no doubt as to what the objects of the association were with -any one above the stature of a child. What they meant waas efficient government by means of efficient appointments to ni the departments of the State. They meant merit instead of favour. 'Cheers.) To speak commercially, they wLsl:ed to get ood value for their money. This was what they meant, and no one believed that they wanted anything else. (Hear.) That they had been inefficient in securing their object he admitted, but that they had not been honest and sincere he denied. (Cheers.) He had said on a formerI occasion, and he repeated it now, that the people of this country had the remedy in their own hands. It was because theeople were not faithful to themselves-and he charged this against the constituencies of the countrythat the remedy had not been got. (Cheers.) In certain constituencies the leaders of our parties on both sides-on the Liberal quite as much as on the Tory side-were found pooh-poohing this 9uestion. As had been observed to him by a friend that morning, they looked to the sort of patronage now existing just as a drunkard did to his brandy-as if they could not do withoutit. (Laughter.) Now, that asso-iation wanted to show the constituencies that they could do without it-that if the various departments could be filled by publc competition, weshould be able to do with onelhalt the number of public servants and be more efficiently -served, though we should have to ay more liberally for the services done. (Hear, hear.) With reference to an election -which was at that moment impending, it had been stated as n thig quite incontrovertible that either of the candidates .Who should declare himself in favour of Administrative :eformn'wold lose his election. (Hear, hear.) The present -system of appointments produced two evils. It filled the departments with inefficient men, and it interferedwith the independeiice of members of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) If they could see 25 or, even better, 50 men who would stand on the floor of the House and tell the Minister that they had their price-that their support was to be bought by; eood government and honest legislation, and by grappline With the evils to wiich he had referred in connexzion with publc appointments, there could be no doubt that in time they woud succeed in getting their own terns. (Cheers.) !fhey bhould endeavour to bring before the eyes of thoughtful men throughout the country the duty which they owed -to themselves on this question, and to urge them to come to the determination that if the members who nown misrepresented them were not prepared to take a healthy view of this subject they should try to find otiers who would. (Cbeers.) Hehopedatthe next election for the city of Lonton they would be able tosecure that at least one out of theirfourrepresentativeswould go to the HouseofCom. unons in that spirit-with an honest determination to know nothing of Government-not to impede them in theirproper w-ork, Eutto stimulatethem in the rightdirection. (Cheers.) lhey ought to submit to the constituencies that hitherto they had been considered as direct parties to the present system, and that now they onght to labour to amend it, and if called upon in that spirit he could not believe that there -was any constituency, or anybodyofEnglishmen,whowonld not regret the esistence of so great an evil, and take the 'most regular, the most constitutional, and themost effectual neans of remedying it. (Cheers. fMr. Brown, the secretary, read the following memorial to Her Majesty :- 'The memorial of the undersigned subjects of your Majesty, with every sentiment of loyalty and respect, hum.

"Your memorialists therefore pray that your Mfajesty may be graciously pleased to direct a full and public inqury into the whole of tht cirGuinstances involved in tho t31of Bars."} jMr. GAsssIoT moved the following resolution . "That the ciretiti3ita.'sces which have come to light in connexion with the fall of Bars are such as to call for a full and public inquiry, and that the memorial which has now been read be adopted and signed for presentation to Her Majesty." He would at once aclnowledge that it was with some reluctance he appeared before them, but at the same time he hoped he might not be mistaken. Hefully aeed in every word of the resolution and the memorial wihhad been read, but he felt that he was not at that moment exactly !carryi out the great principle of Administrative Reformthat of aving the right man in the right place. He was a mercantile man, and was not quite sure he was spealdng on a subject which he theroughly understood. He would, however, speak what he had to say in plain unmistakeable language, andin doing so he would state nothing but what had I been discussed in private society-that had been talked of e verywhere, though as yet, so far as he knew, not named !in any meetig like the present. The Administrative Reform Association bad been accused of supineness in not bringing before the public much informaton that had been submitted to them, and though the statements he would now inmake were morally correct, and not in the slightest way exagerated, it was possible that, if not from that platform, at least from the press, an attempt would be made to i impugn them. (Hear, hear.) Humble, however, as his postion was compared with the names he had to bring before the meeting, he would not shrink from the duty he had unertaken. He was one of the trading comMUnity who, previously to this, had been unconnected With anypolitical movement. On a former occasion he addressed them from that place, because The Times-that great and powerful organ that swayed public opinion from day to ayfor good or evil-had pulisheld a series of thrilling articles which roused the most apathetic to their country's wrongs and to their country's shame. (Cheers.) Since then the resultof many montha' anxious deliberation had brought him to the conclusion that the cause of our evils was deeply seated, but that it could be uprooted by the efforts of thoughtful, steady, considerate men, provided these men were such as the public had confidence in and would heartily support. (Hear, hear.) There were two great cvils under which the country was now suffering-one was a growing tendency to shift responsibility to irresponsible rties; the other was the red tape system that pervadea very department, military, naval, and civiL JR-ear, hear.) Our army was divided into two great and distinct classes. In each we had the same bravery, the same discipline, the same high moral and physical courage. One oranch received all its honours direct from the Crown; the other, the Indian army, originally created by the merchants of london, still recruited its officers and men from the middle and lower classes. The "p per Ten Thousand" seldom thought it worthy of their ambition; the one class of officers was adorned with old epaulettes, the other with silver. (Hear, hear.) To a civilan the distinction seemed to be one without a difference but thedifference which had been made in pratieo between the two services had been productive of the most direful consequences to our allies the Turks, and of not a little disgrace to ourselves. The case of Brigadier Mayne, an account of whose death appeared a short time ago in !77w Timzes newspaper, was a fllarant instance of this. Amore dashing and courageous cavahy officer never breathed-he had great experience in leading Mahomedan troops, and when it was first proposed to form a Turkish Contingent in our pay he was summoned from India, where he held an important command, for the purpose of being employed in that force. He remained here some time in preparing for his new appointment, when it was suddeny intimated to him that itwould be necessary for him to obtain the sanction of his Royal Highness Prince Albert before it could be ratified- (Groans.) It would be highly indecorous in him (Mr. Gassiot) to offer any opinion as to whether the sanction of Prince Albert ought to have anything to do with such an appointment; but certain it was that the proposed ap pointment did not take place because it did not meet wi& the approval of his Royal Highness. (Cries of " Shame T") Colonl Shirley, who was then in Leicestershire, was snmmoned to town by telegaph; he was a Queen's officer, he had interest at Court, and he received the command, while Brigadier Mayne returned to India dirited and disappointed. "Lord Hardinge," he had said, when the subject of this scandalous treatment was alluded to in conversation, "is a brave, gallant, and generous officer; he is a personal friend of mine, and he would gladly serve me, but, with the influences which surround him, the sooner he is removed from his command the better." (Cheers.) He had often heard this kind of interferene on the part of his Royal Highness complained of by military men; it had been openly discussed in the public prints, and a facetious hut most important journal had made it the subject of its pen and pencil. No doubt his Royal Highness, by his public ut, his energy, and his refined taste,had identified himsdwith the progrs of social improvemedtinthiscountry(criesof "No!"); but,whenhis name was made the scapegoat for imbeclity and incapacity, then, indeed, it was time for the country to complain of responsibility being thrown on irresponsible houlders (Applaiso.) !l li troduvtion of British officers into the Turkish army was expected to do great things, but somehow or another sueh had not yet been the case. General Williams was appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner with the army in Asia, and in that capacity took a leading share in the defence of Bars, but it appeared that unfortunately that appointment had not met with the approval of Her Maiesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and here their old friend "red tape" began to peep out. A Turkish loan, as they all knew, had been recently raised in this country, and it might naturally have been expected that some part, at least, of it would be applied to putt:ngOniar Pasha's army into such a state of efficiency as would enable it to assist its belearuered comrades. N-o such thing. " Red tape" interfered, certain forms were declared to be necessary to paying over the money; it could only be transmitted in a particular way ; it remained in the Bank of England, and Omar Pasha for the want of it was forced to remain inactive and see his army decimated by disease and starvation. Meanwhile General Williams, hard pressed in Bars, his 36 despatches unanswered and wonderig to receive no succour either from the Turks or his own countrymen, wrote to General Beatson, who then comnianded the Bashi-Bazouks, desiring him to march to his aid; but the repeated representations of that officer to Lord Stratford de Reddliffe requesting to be sent with his men to Kars were unheeded, and he, to was condemned to forced inacrion. What foUlowed aTl the world knew; General Williams and. his heroic garrison, after defending Bars until they were reduced to the last extremities of starvation, were obliged at last to surrender at discretion to a Russian victor. 5' Shame 11) But it was not only in military affairs that the mifluence of red tape was to be traced; it was rampant in every department of the navy. Two remarkable instances of the manner in which it worked there had lately come to his knowledge. A captain in the navy-a young and active officer, especially conversant with naval gunnery-had made himself acquainted, under very peculiar circumstanecs, with all the soundings about Cronstadt up to St. Petersburg. This vas known to the Admiralty, but when he asked for a command in the Baltic, to which he was entitled, instead of sending him where his services would have been valiable to his country, they despatched him with troops to the Cape of Good Hope. Eaughtr. Wocouldsaywhat2mightnotbhave beendone dSitrC.Napierhadthis officerwithhim initheBaltieinthe first campaign. In the same way they had sent a young naval cadet, who had been at school in St. Petersburg, and who could speak Russian like a native, to the West Indies, where, of all places, he would have least chances of tuminm this valuable acquisition to account, and where he would be soonest likely to lose it. They were honoured by the presenee on the platform of several members of the Legislature ; and, if he might so far presume, he would offer them a few words of advice on a matter of no slight importance. The session of Parliament was approaching, and they would soon be receiving, if they had not already received, invitations from the Premier to partake of his hospitalities. At these political rsunimis, as they were called, the noble Premier's brilliantly lighted saloons would be flled with all that was distinguished in rank, talent, beauty, and fashion; the Ministerhimself-the asperities of St. Stephen's entirely thrown aside-wouldbe all bows and smiles, full of charming conversation on al sorts of subjects-arts, sciences literature, social progress, everything but politics; and a man who entered there for the first time would fancy that he had attained the height of human happiness. iBut it was in these walls that the liberties and resources, nay, even the lives of British subjects wer.e sacrificed-sacrificed to the shake of the hand of a noble lord, to the polite condescension of her grace or her ladyship. (Applause. Then it vwas that members of the Legislature, for the sake of an invitation for their-wives or dau,ghters, for the sake of a ticket to Almack's or Her Majesty'sball, unthinkinglysaerified theirown independence and the interests of theconstituents by whomtheyhad been Eent to Parhament. (Loud applause.) These remarks epplied more especially to the commercial representatives, and it was against this cankerworm of corruption that he wished to warn young and ardent, and still honest. poUticians. The subject of the memorial now before the m Ieeting mnust, sooner or later, comne before the tribunal of Parliament, and it was on t-hat account that hie had alluded to this illegitimate influence. In conclusion, he wou[ld urge i pon the maembers of Parliament now present not to forget tht&ope cmeiveexaminations and strict indlividual TeTns'li] ty were the watchwords of administrative reiform. (Applause.) Mir. &I" vERs seconded the resolution. He belieTed in. the honesty Of P, part- at least of theripresent. Cabinet, and the inquiry which the memorial prayed for would give that portion of the Cabinet an opportunity of exculpatting themiselves from the blame which the fall of Barsha cast upon thema. It would &lso let daylight ino the arrangements of our diplomnatic service and it WOUld, 3nor, than anything else, convince t.he nainof the necessity trewaa for carrying reform into the very highest brnhsof the public service. It was tco the Crown, not to the Ministers, nor to the House of Commons, that theyinust look for this inquiry; the re iiilt would rest oen the highestpersonage in the re and he felt sure that it needed buta forcible expresson of public opinion to induce 5rul*jt, but if hia committeeodid niomaore tlhiitheSebas-' ~O~ceanitte dd. las year it would not Ui~ff'muoh us.-.

He balieved the noble Lord to be entirely innocent of all participation in the cowardice and apathy which had led to tho fall of Ears, and it was on that account that he wished to give him an opportaity of clearine himself from all blame respecting it. Mr. A. I. BZIAlDS, in supporting the resolution, said that, though he was not a member of the Administrative Reform Association, ha Was an Administmtiye Reformer, and he advocated the inquiry prayed for in the WhIoAal; thinking that the fall of Ears farnished a flagrant illustra. tion of the abuses and mismanagement against which the movement was directed. To discover what had led to this lamentable event they must go back to the very first events inthe "1Tragedyof Errors,' ashecalledthe presentwar. What had caused themassacreofSinope? The repressive action of Lord Stratford de Redeliffe at Constantinople. On November 5, 1853, just before that affair, Lord Stratford wrote home that he had succeeded in dissuading the Porte from sending a detachment of line-of-battle ships and frigates into the Black Sea, and prevailed on it to send orders to Omar Pasha and Selim Pasha to act as much as possible on the defensive; and yet a short time afterwards be wrote home, in language which he must say read more like the fag end of the soliloquy of an assassin than a diplo. inatic despatch:- "Forgive me, my Lord, if in this combination of circtustances, all tending to the same conclusion, I cannot lose sight of public opinion, or of that mature judgiuent whibh later times will pronounce upon our conduct at this unprecedented juncture." An attempt had been made to throw blame upon Omar Pasha, but nothing could be more unjust. Unfortunately he found hinself unable to do anything without the consent of others. By a convention, dated the 8th of May, 1854, he was prevented from adopting any line of action of his own, and was obliged to take the collective opinions of the allied generals on any movement which he ro sed to make. He was not, therefore, a free agent, an? what was the result ? Instead of going where he could be of service in relieving Kars, he was sent to the north-east coast of the BLck Sea, where his army would be rendered useless. (Hear, hear.) He was able to prove that the army was in excellent condition and admirably fitted to relieve Ears. It was unable to go just where it was sent, but it could have operated successfullyjfrom Erzeroum on the fortress of Kar.; (Hear, hear.) What vwas more, the British Commissioner who was employed in sounding the Caucasian tnbes informed them that, even in the event of their aidin - Omar Pasha, France and England would not recognize tSe independence of those States. (" Shame.") It was matter of notoriety that from the tire they were in Silistria the Turkish troops had been prevented from doing anything. It was evident that tbe object was to decimate the a-my of Turkey and to strangle Turkey herself. They had aimed at this throughout, and they would do it to tho end, for the " sick man" must, if pos. sible, be disposed of. (Hear, hear,) And if the terms of peace now proposed were carried out, the climax would be put on their efforts for these terms of peace would divide the Turkish empire. The Danubian Principalities would be given to another Sovereign, and yet this was called preserving the integrity of Turkey. Then, as to the independence of Turkey, fonmerly Russia only wished to interfere for the protection, as she said, of the Greek poplation; but now the protectorate, as it was called, would be quadrupled, provided always the terms now pro. posed were adopted-a result which he could not believe would ever take place. (Cheers.) He did not believe that Russia wouold Â¢avo u Ears. (Hear.) Wehadbeen worked oat. L cry of " churabuOoggd."1 Russia would not give up opened the way to our Indian possessions. (Hear, hear.) It was impossible as yet to tell what effect the fall of Ears had produced on the Kurds, the Affghans, and other tribes with which we had to deal-tribes which knew nothing of Sebastopol, though they all knew the importance of Ears. (Hear, hear.) Ears had been deliberately neglected, and the Contingent kept back, or, as T77e Ti7aes Correspondent wrote, " bandied about like a footbalL" (Hear, hear.) General Beatson wrote three times to Lord Stratford de Reddliffe to be allowed to go there, but he received no answer. No one was sent, and Ears was permitted to falL He would not harrow their feelings by describing the sufferinns of the garrison. These things would be told by history to posterity, and they were discussed now by those who had been called "contemporaneous posterity"-tho people of other nations. (Hear, hear.) He did not want to see Lord Stat. ford de Redclffe made a seapat in this matter. (Cheers.) It was quite poosbethat he might have taken a malicious pleasure in all that ie did, and that ho had his own private pique to urge him on. He might have said, as had been alleged, that Williams should perish in Kars. All this and more might be true; but he ndnoidea that he should be made a scapegoat of; he was too old to break his heart like Brigadier Mayne. What we wanted to know was, who sent him there and kept him there ? (Cheers.) His belief was, that somebody else than the ilinister had the reins of Government in his hand in this matter. (Cheers.) What was the Minister for War made for in this country ? (Hear, hear.) Was it to wit ness all these things withoutstrivingtoremedy thesm9 Hear, hear.) From the mouths of the Russians themselves we could learnwhat mighthavebeendone. GeneralMouravieff himself, on the 30th of September, the day after his repulse at Ears, wrote a despatch m which he gave the reason why the attack was then made. He stated that he had been informed the Turkish troops had received reinforcements in the vicinity of Batoum; that the enemy proposed to make a movement on the Gouriel and Akhalbagk, and at the same time to advance from Erzeroum to lEars; he resolved, therefore, to attack the latter fortress on the 29th. This despatch had ap. peared in the Imatiide Etsse, and thus we learnt, even from th0 onomy, what we ought to have done. (Hear, hear.) But in the East everyone said that Ears was intended to be sacrificed in order to obtain dishonourable terms of peace-terms that would cover this country with shame and degradation. (Cheers.) If. we accepted dishonourable terms of peace now, the act would one dary recoil upon our heads, for might not France be tempted at some future day to attack our shores when she saw what had been our bearing and conduct thronghout and at the termination of this war? (Cheers.) The country must know by whom the neglect of the Turkish army was brought about. He could not believe that it was the fault of British generals or admirals, for they were ever actnated by the spmit of brave and generous men. He had heard that after the massacre of Sinope Admiral Dundas wished to revenge the deed, but was forbidden. The great difficulty was to get at the real culprits, for in this country there was now no real responsibility, and c-erything was done under the despotic rule of the secret council of 10 in the Cabinet. (Cheers.) With regard to thefour points? he denounced them as so many proposals for the benefit of Russia. He wished to know what was meant by the "neutralization of the Black Sea?' It was a Gladstonian phrase, but he should like to have arecise idea of its meaning. He was unable to see why key should not have a fleet on her own waters because Russia could not have one also. (Hear.) He believed that the Ministry of this country for many years past had acted as executors of the will of Peter the Great, and, in conclusion, expressed his eanest conviction that, unless a new and better spirit pervaded the people and Government of Eug. land, we should become a byword and a reproach, and the laws and constitution of England would perish amid the scornsand thescoffingofsroundingnations. (Cheers.) Mr. MEBCn supported the resolution, and made some observations in defence of the general principle of administrative reform. Mr. LrsDSAY said, he felt there was as much need of adnnnistrative reform now as when he first appeared on that platformi as one of the originators of this great movement. The reform which they had obtained was, after all, but a surface reform, and one of the best proofs he could I give of that would be to read a letter which he had just I received from an officer high in command in the Turkish Contingent-a bripaelier-eneraL It was as follows:- " The public prints wiTi have informed you of the strange vacillation and indecision regarding the employment of the Turkish Contingent. We were made ready for service early in August. why we were not employed remains, no doubt, to be explained to the country; but the real reason of the delayhasbeen simply this-thehead-quarters' people in the Crimea have evinced a paltry, narrow-minded jealousy of us in consequence of the rank given us by the Government, and determined to throw every obstacle in the way of our employment in the Crimea, in order that we should not interfere with them by superseding them in commands. Had these gentlemen refe= there was no chance of any of us interfering with them, and, even if we had. those men o' any rink in the Contingent have served their country a sufciently long time of hard, soldierlike service-I mean particular y the Indian officers-to give them everv experience and fitness for the suyerior rank bestowed on them bythe Crovwn. And there isanother point, these said gentlemen might have remembered that we have all come out volunteers for the service, and were most ansious to get to the Crimea, or anywhere, into active service, while so many gentlemen of the class who objected to us-I mean the featherbed soldiers, the men of Horse Guards and other interests-were leaving the Crimea and their regiments there whenever they could get away. Nothing has disgusted me s0 much as the unconcealed satisfaction evinced in getting away from the Crimea by some, and the total want of shame displayed-a lamentable want of soldierlike feelin, by no means general, but it exists, and has shown itself, and I would like to see all such men removed from our army. Had General Simpson baAd us, aws he ought, up before Sebas. topol months since, or sent here, he wAould have gained a remnforcementhbe much required of tried, highly disciplined troops; and, had they been sent him some months since, something could have been done here; but the delays and miserable vacillation have causd a fearful cost to the country of at least 60,0001., I am informed for detention of transports alone. This, no doubt, vill be alluded to in the House. There is no excuse for the authorities here. We were amply ready, all men and officers burning for service; our detention in camp abovo Buyukdere was a complete loss of time and force. The Turkish regiments banded over to us are in the highest stateof discpline. Their interior economy of regiments is splendid; their method and hanagement firt-rate- we can't improve upon it. These men only required to bo properly armed and clothed to be perfect; and the British ifficers only requred to beecome aoquainted with their men; andthli they would acquir6 more lcnbledge of in one week on service here than an two months in camp on the Bosphoras. After fooling about until the ond of October we at last sailed for this, and, of course, have rriyedtoo late to do. anything, but will be hard pressed to hut ourselves in and to forage and feed ourselves during the winter. This is the finest forag countr3- in the worl ano had e been seat here amoth even before we were, and our cavalry sent with us, we could have securea and laid in sqiffcient hay 'for ourselves, and alse;,if veqvlred,for the allied cvantise-camp nearSebastopol; butsnoi one hbre seema So have 'had'their ytes,ortheiracuses about them to bave given any d6scriEp tson c-tbioemtrj.'It is lly disagind.amiuoying beyondenduraae te- sch a sldenid-oppoitity siegl'ct'ed.

'The reason why they have not been wAls because our commander-in-chief would not use the troops at big disposaL The head-qunrterg' party at the Crimea objected to the omployment of the Contingent, and, having few troops of their own, the service of the country has been more than neglected in consequence of the narrow-minded, iliberal, tnsoldierlike spirit evinced by those whom the conntry had a right to expect would have shown a better example." After receiving such a letter as that~ though -he might be told that there was more civility to be got at the Admnralty, that the clerks attended to their duties, that the accounts were no longer lost, and that an answer might be got within a weeki or so, instead of three months, he felt there was still something radically Wrong, which must and should be removed. (CheerTs.) t was said that the assciation did not know what it was driving at; but he contended that during the short time it had been in existence it had done much to secure a reform in the different departments of the State. StiU there was much to do. They ouht to take one subject at once, to discuss it bit by bit, to enlighten public opinion uponit,and, finally,tolayameasure beforeParliament to carry outpractically all the changes which they felt tobe desiable. For instance, there was the consolidation of the Queen's andthelndian army, and the abolition of aU thejobbery and corruption in the civil service. Those were two pointswell deseing their attention, andwhich, if obtained nould confer the greatest benefits on the country. It was saidnthat no Governmenteould exist withoutthe ptronage of the civil service;* buthis answecr to that was that no Government which could not exist without that patronaeo ought to oxistat alL. (Cheers.) Another subject, too, w ldeserving of thleir attention was the secret influenc at the present mnoment exercised over the Executive, which he was sorry to say was doing much harm, and which s unconstitutionaL (Loud cheers.) He was not now about to make any charges against individuals, but, as agood constitutional mnt, he was dcetermined to maintain the constitution,whichherespected, andwhichhebelivedIto be the bestin the world. Butit could not be maintained if the Executive, placed in power by the people, was not to be allowed to exercise its own judgment as it thought best. (Cheers.) This was a point for the Administrative Reform Association to work at, and, if they sncceeded in curbing that influence within its proper limits, none, he was sure, would thank them more than the noble lord at the head of the Government, and the honest nortion of the Cabinet over which he presided. 'They would feel grateful to anyone who would relieve them from an influence which was tying their hands, and which prevented them from doing that which they beheved to be necessary for the honour and glory of the country which they goverm. Loud cheers.) Mr. LtWaENC supported t e motion because he felt that the interest of this country had been sacrificed and betrayed by the conduct of the Government. When the war was commenced the general feeiing ivas that we were going to war with the enemy of liberty and civilization, with the murderer of Poland and assassin of Hungary,-not to add freshterritoryto Austria, nortobenefitTPrussia,buttodeliver the world from the aggressive ambition of Russia. 'lThese feelings, however, had been grossly betrayed by Her Majesty's Ministers, and there was not a man of plam common sense present who was not convinced that tars might have been relieved, and our alies, the Turks, spared the terrible blow which had been inflicted on them, had our Government thought fit to do so. To defer as much as possible to the despotic Powers of Europe, to add to the Danubian frontier of Austria, and not to humiliate Russia, if it could be avoided, were the feelings which animated English statesmen of the present day, and which had led to this great disaster. The strong sense, however, of public opimon expressed on that platform would no doubt havc its effect. It might not all at once change a course of policy which had been years in progress, but it would alarm the Ministers and startle even such miserable instruments as Lord Stratford do Redcliffe. (Cheers.) He hoped, at least, that it would lead to this inquiry being granted, and that might lead to something more-perhaps even to impeachbment. (Cheers.) At all events, it would teach our statesmen that we would not be betrayed, that we were Englishmen, and would not be sacrificed to the interests of Austria or Russia. (Hear, hear.) The resolution was then put and carried unanimously. Dr. CiEL.izCE moved, and Mr. BENN-oCo seconded a vote of thanks to the Chairman, who in returning thanks stated that a bill had been prepared by the association for the reform of the Civil Sernice, which would entirely sweep away all Government patronage. This terminated the proceedings of the meeting.
CANDIDAMES FOR CAMBRIDGE: U2NIVERs.-The considerations which may be supposed to influence the members of the Cambridge Senate m their choice of a representative to succeed Atr. Goulbum are at the present tume more than usualy easy of calculation. Imperial politics are for the time condensed into cordial support of Government in maintaining the firmest attitude during the negotiations that will probably occupy the next few weeks, or factious criticisms on its past conduct, intended to pave the way for a speedy transference of the reins of power to the ardent ptriutisutof Mr. Disraell and the steady principles of Lord Derby. Local University politics are merged in the one great movement for substituting representative institutions for the autocratic government that has for three centuries thwarted the progress and mismanaged the business of Cambridge Umversity. By their opinions and conduct on these two questions must the present candidates for the representation of the University stand or fall, menle the constituency of the University are prepared to sacrifice patriotism and consistency on the or rather to the party names which have taken the place of real distinctions, and mean now little nore than convenient covers for personal ambition. Mr. Denman comes forward with a definite announcement of his intentions or. h these great questions. He will support the Government, whose conduct of the war he admires, in obtaining a safe and honourable ceace, or, should their attempts fail through the duplicity and obstinacy of Russia, in pursuling the war with redoubled perseverance and energy. 31r. Walpole on the contrary-a foUvower of -Mr. Disraeli-will not make any promises on the subject, but1 refers generaUly to his votes in the House of Commons. We know no principle that will explain Mr. Walpole's conduct in relation to the Russian war, except thoroughgoing partisanship, sending him along with the worse section of hisparty, and not with that respectable portion of the Conservatives who prefer the honour of their country to the gratification of party pique or the promotion of party interests. On the University question Mr. Denman expresses himself with plainness and earnestness. He uses the habitual language of a "enuine University reformer, and hits the kernel of the question when he pledges himnself to do his utmost to secure for the UTniversity representative institutions. All we are allow ed to know of Mr.a Walpole's sentimentson this most important subject is, that we may, if we lease, consult his votes. That process completed, we find Mr. .alpole systematically doing his bestfomutilatethe Oxford Bil in its p e through the House; and we are much mistaken ifto his distinguished efforts on that occasion he is not indebted for the zealous devotion of certain well-known residents, whom nothing would induce to support a Unsiversity reformer, unless it were the opportunity of persecuting a heretic. If from these two questions we ato the more general politics of our time, we find Mr. renman professng himself no party-man, and refusing those premature pledges which bmd the representativo to abdicate his jiudgment of circumstances. His principles he descnbes by the now familiar phrase of liberal but Conservative. On the other hand, Mfr. Walpole is bound to a party by the strongest ties. His past career, to wich he appeaLsgrantees his future. He will foUow wherever lfr. Disraeli leads, except when by chance his leader strays into some ethnological liberalism, of which Mr. Walpoleis utterly incapable;though even MIr. Walpole had his errant impulses, when, while a member of a retrogressive Government, he astosmnded his friends by proposing to bestow the franchise on every raw country lad whom the bounty seduced into the militia. Between two candidates whose public position is thus broadly characterized and contrasted, the University of Cambridge is called on to choose, at an important period of the national history and its own development. To prefer M1r. Walpole, would show a careless indifference whether the Government be supported and the University reformed. Moreover, Mnr.Denmanseems to have qualifications that should win strong sympathies from such a constituency as he is appealing to. He united an acadetmical career marked with the highest honours to a personal popularity founded on that mianly character whlch enters so largely into the success in life of ambitious Englishmen. Against there qualifications we must in fairness put his comparative want of political reputation. But the University is not like a common constiuency, which requires the stamp of vugar approvalto befLxed ona man before cerning his sterhg qualities. Mr. Denman is the sort of man excluded from common constituencies til he has-attained high rank at tho bar. He has little but his own distinguished talents to recommend him, and it will be creditable to the University to place a comparatively young man in Parliament, whose talents its own system has trained, whoowes to it his first distinctions, and who wi devote to its interests the unbiassed judgmentW and unfettered energy which are not to be ea,pecXed from,' a party man however respectable his character, however fluent his oratory, however successful his political career.-Specaor.

The general state of the fron trade in South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire is xeported to be good; and, although some little amount of ut:derselling prevails, it does not affect in any mxateral degree the market for the best descriptons of thO staple article of these districts. The fct is that the prices of rawnmaterial and labour prevent any makers, except they are extremely needy, from running under current sales; andthe fact of their doing so, if mnown, attaches a stigma which it is most desirable to avoid after recent disasters. The pig makers maintain their prices i stone is as dear, if not dearer than ever ; coal, rather than declining, as it is stated to be doing for domestic purposes in London, is in great request, at hinh rates, andlabour to bedependedupon is no cheaper. Under tA eae circumstances, and takhng into consideration the increased demand for iron for home consumption, as well asposJsibly the increased spring requirements for the United States and Canada, no person can reasonably anticipate a reduction of the quotation adopted at the last quarterly meeting. The dispute between the ironmasters of South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire and the railway cornpanies with respect to the proposed increase of freightages for the conveyance of goods continues, and, unhappily, as faras we can leatrn, assumtes a more se-ious aspeet than at ft-st was anticipated. The charge from Garston or Liverpool to L this stsct willhe an advance from the priceof conveyancenowcharged, . d., to7s. od. perton. Thisisconceived to be an extraordinary exaction, not justified hy circumstances, and placing the iromasters of Staffordshire in a position of geat disadvantage when competing with their formidable rivals in South Wales. It wil act almost as an entireprohibition upon Ulverstone and other northern ores. It is encouraging to find, notwithstandig the recent depression of trade, that the traffic upon our local navigation. continues to maintain comparative prosperity. The withdrawal of business by the construction of competing lines of railway must, of course, be taken into consideration, and the operation of severe seasons has, at particular times, an injurious; influence upon the returns of canal companies. But, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the Old Birmingham Canal, which runs through the centre of the maufacturing districts, as shown by its report this week, maintains its position; and when the new route projected through the Nletherton tnunel is completed (the works of wihich are just commenced), there is little doubt immense faeilities will be given to the increasing business and trafico of this important neighbourhood. BIy the establishment of this route of canal it is calculated that the conveyance of coals from the west of Dadley to Birmingham (where an immense quantity is consumed by manufacturers) will be Is. 6d. a ton less than at present. The various branches of trade and manufacture in Birmingham are represented on all hands to be improving. The exportations to Australia, after two years of depression, are improving, and the dearth of orders which for a long time was noticeable in the Brazilian trade has latterly been succeeded hy substantial co ussions for Birmingham manufactures from Bahia and Rioi., These may be taken as favourable indications of future prosrity, and, if the war should be concluded upon honourable terms, our merchants are sanguine enough to expect an overwhelming trade with n.ations nearer home. The factors of the town, most of whom have now agents throughout the country, speak of the orders received satisfactorily. In the country towons of the north, where credit during the past year was doubtful, afiairs wear a more hopeful aspect. Stocks of almost all descriptions of hardware have for many months past been extremely low; ironmongers generaUy, owing to the uncertain prices of material and the possible change in Birmingham discounts, refusing to give orders to any considerable extent. They have learnt a lesson. Raw materials of all descriptions have maintained their price-some have advaned. Birmingham disconts are generally in^ stea quo, and now stocks muust be replemshed, inm some instances at advanced prices. Wth regard to braÂ£s foundry, more particularly, there is little chance of any reductionstrom the existing lists; andpresent discounts are likely to continue for some tune to come. Fewer chanuges were made in travellers' lists previous to the commencement of their present journeysthan have occurred at a similar period for the last two or three years. For some descriptions of hardware there is at present a good demand, and ourchiefmanufacturersarewellemployed. Edged tools areg,reatlyinreqest, anda largequantibyundlerorderfor exportationtothe w est India colonies. Theho}lowware trade is mmproving, and the workmen employed in this branch are not so entirely dependent upon themanufacture of the munitions of war as they were a few months aago. The fire-iron busitness, whichisthe almost exciusiveemploymentof artisans residing in certain localities of Birmgham, is scarcely so brisk asat the commencement of winter. In some slops work is extremelyslack, and the masters, for the goods they do produce, are compelled to accept almost any prices the "slaughterers," as they are termed, mayoffer them. Inferior qualities of these articles are at the present season, when the winter trade may be said to be draving to a close, seling at ruinously low prices. Implements of husbandry continue to be in good demand, and are sent off in great qantities, particularly to the southern and western parts of NO1TTLGHAId, JAN. 26. The demand for hosiery suitable for the home supply has been fairly sustained throughout the week- and, as far as we can at present judge, there is every probability of this year's spring trade proving considerably larger than that of last year. Mfanufacturers are generaUy fuly employed, and a fair amount of general business is doing. or circular hosiery, shirts, pants, and wrought cotton Aose the demand continues steady. In the woven glove department there is very little doing, although there is a slight improvement on the long depression that has existed; but there is not a tithe of the business transactilg in this branch that was usual in former years at this season. The deficency, however, is more than made up by the manufacturers of warp fabrics for cut gloves; and the framework-knitted glove hands thereby throam out are absorbed into other branches of manufacture. Vi)n the question of labour we are satisfied that Nottingham will bear a favourable comparison with any other large manufacturing town. The wail of distress has never been heard, even during the dullest part of the season. The Americans are expected to commence fall operations in about six weeks from this time, and, judging from the reports we have received from the United States, and the prospects of our home spring trade, we believe that our workmen wlvl be fully employed, at least until Midsummer. Stocks are low; the tendency of cotton is to rise in value, and, should the war be reaUy about to terminate, the demand from every quarter will be such as to cause prices to advance upon ali cses of hosiery. Though some of our lace manufacturers, particularly those engaged in the fancy branches of the business, appear. disapPointed at the manner in which the spring trade is opening, others, and very large houses, report a fairld- . mand for goods, particularly for plain nets, both for the home tae and for exportation. Further orders continue to be received from the United States, and a good many Germans, now in the market, are making purchases much as usual at this season. During thelast mont severa advances have been made upon the price of plain nets, and prices are expected still to rise as the prospects of peace become more certain. ILICESTER, JmN 2G. The fancy department connected with our hosiery trade is more quiet tttan it has bcen for some time past, and very little is doing in the glove branch The demand for regnlar hosierg for home conisumnption is dull, and goods are semlia exceedingly low, taking into consideration the high price of wooL Employment is becomaing still more scarce;- some heavy contracts are, however, expected for the Goverrnment, which will enimate the labour-market. Wools are-on the advance, good average lots of English wool realizing as much as 33s. ported. In yarns the market continues fim at the late rise; even at these rates spinners are uwilling to engage orders for future delivery. 1ESI J:K. 2G. There is no particular feature of change to notice in the state of the woolen cloth trade since this day se'rnight. The tone of the trade continues firm, andmnufa.cturers are slightly increasingttheir work, while merchants and buyers geueraily operate with care, but to an extent notmuch, if anything, below what is usual at this season of the year. The uncertainty which still prevails as to the negotiatious for peace, coup led with the near approach of the opening of the session of Parliament, tends to cause hesitation as to bargains, contracts, and orders ; and, as was observed in our last report, until what we may caU the present crisis has v:edaway, thejwoollen trade is not expected to be very svely. To-day's markets in the cloth-hall have partaken of the same feelng which we have indicated as that of the trade generally. There was a good attendance of merclants, but they were not very eager buyers; yet, in the aggregate, a good bulk of cloth was sold, more being removed fromi the haIls after the close of the markets than might have been anticipated. The largest purchases were those of tweeds and liurht coeds. Thereportsfroin'uddersfiem and Holmfirthths rweelare satisa.ctory.

DhlBLf', JA-s. 26. Trade has been rather more active this week than anyv wreek since the Christmas holydcays commenced, but the improvement has not been accompanied by any increase it prices. The prospects of peace-ill-defined and uncertain though they bc -have exerdsed a considerable influence on some of the markets-those for corn, tallow, &c.-and prices have gone down without promoting business-none save the most necessitous, being disposed to purchase in hep resent doubtful position of the war question. There has been in London an increased demand for su3ar, but without any corresponding.increase in prices, whiech only advanred a shilling or two. Here the demand is stil slack, and bnsiness accordingly continues dull; but we are still of opinion that prices will not go much lower this season. In Smithfield, on. Thursday, there was but a short supply, thin attendance, and consequently but a dull market. The prices of provisions have not maintained the improvement of last weel. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday inclusive were 28,1171., aXa'ist 21,1957. last week.

We have not shrank from e'iposing with the utmost freedom and fulness tllz manifold defects of oiur military system and to iniefficiency Of all the deparTments that iuinister to it; but thilI we may say with pride, that, whatever be the defecLs of our system or the falnuis of our shd eamawship, the standard of oxur political iaorality is high, and there is not a public man am=ong its who does not come fully up to the Iighest yequirements of that stanidard. Not only are the hands of our public men free from adl pecuniary corruption, but there is, not one of them, we firmly believe, in the slig,htest degree involved in theo taint of transactions bn tho Stock-Exchange. The earlier and superior information- necessarily. possessed by public men gives opportuinities 3f amassing dishonourable wealth, which here, at least, are contemptuously disregarded.

We have not, i-- deed, thought it our duty to betray an impolitic andindecent eagerness for the cessation of hostilities, or to encourage the aggressive tendencies of Russis by proving our anxiety to be freed from the heavyg infiction that she has brought upon the world.. We hold that in the negotiations for peace a great :nation is bound to preserve the same steadfast and unflinching resolution as in the very midst of war; and, as she would not shrink from the one because it is terrible and repsive, so sbe ought not to Sling herself heedlesaly into the arms of the other because she vh attractive and alluino. ]Dnt we believe it will be found that, slow as;we have show.a ourselves to entertain the con'iction that the wrar is at an ead, we are as anxious a anyaone, not for the immediate prormise, but for tiie: absolute realization of peace, and that we best comsult our ow-n dignity, and best in the long ran secure the isness of our aimas and our negotations, by starling firm tio the ground we have taken up, and reservir. our congratulations and; rejoicingsfoT the time wlien the belligerent Powers shand have exchanged the ratificati.cs of a solewin ana binding' treaty.
The Associstion for Admiinistrativu. Reform was, like many others, the resstt of ani sft-recurring English delusiesr. The first step in mgard to an abme in this cor.-try is to mneet and denounce it; the mext is to seek for some c%gganizationi by which ito destruction nry be attairedi.

The report of the Eastern Counties Railway tueeting held on Friday last yields abundant evidence of angry feeling and excited passions on both sides. It is for the majority of the Shareholders to inquire whether the right lies with Mr. WADDIwGrOy or his opponents. WVe will not pretend to decide the question of whether or not the engagements entered into by lr. WYADDLNGTOx and hisfrienackvwiththe Newmarket and Chesterford and the Royston and Hitchin were detrimental to the interests of the Eastern Counties Proprietors. We will not say whether the Harwich or Ipswich boats have been profitable obiects of speculation. WVe know nothing of the loan to the corporation of Hfarich beyond what the disputants assert on either side. We will not even consider the mnore important question of the persnanent way, and other points vw-hich have occupied the attention of the Eastern Counties Proprietors for the last seven or eight months. These are special nmatters of business which must be decided on ordinary business grounds byreasonable men. But what is the meaning of such a meeting as the one wlhich was held on Friday last at the London Tavern 9 The scene which actualIy occtured was more like an irish faction-fight in the olden time, or a townand-gown row at either of the Universities, or that epoch of a contested election wvhen the rival candidates are addressing the meeting. Shouits of applause on one side and groanis and hootings on the other greeted the entry of Mr. WADDrNGTo.N, and the proceedings which followed were in strict harmony with the sonorous prologue. Four long columns devoted to the chronicles of riot and the record of abuse and invective will be ftound in our impression of Saturday as the contri:bution of the Eastern Counties to contemporary literature. Into the merits of the squabble, as we before said, we will not enter; but, as persons totally unprejudiced, whio do not hold, and. never will hold, one shilling's worth of the company's stoclk, we wound beg of the I'roprictors to forget their anger for a moment and to lookl quietly at resldts. The value of tLeir shares has decreased-they best ;now to what extent-and, at the same time, the wevekly income of the company has increased to a very considerable amount. No matter whether the weekly returns fly up or fall down, the Proprietors are equally damnified in their interests. A fierce seditious spirit is the curse of these l opular corporations. Until there is a little lEss of party tlere will be little more oc premium. It seems as though there must be an explosion every four or five years, a row, and a settlement. From the moment the settlement is made the seeds of fresh evil begin to gerninate. flhere is a Chairman's party, and a party opposed to the Chairman, invariably a minority. It is not wtorth while to buy over or influence more than a clear majority, so that for a time the -ill of the Chairman and his henchmen is supreme. At length the natural force of an opposition begins to operate in motions very partially supported, and divisions provoked rather as tokens ,of dissent than with the hope of arriving at any immedinite result. In due course, and especially if the railway fall upon evil days, the opposition .increases in power, and the Chaiman and Directors, in order to maintain their position, are driven upon courses more arbitrary and more violent. A -itched battle then occurs between the rival factions, a committee hostile to the majority at the Board is appointed, and the regular attack is delivered in due form. Then follows a crisis, and the end. The boat is patched up for another run, and 'v:nin sent forth utpon her voyage under all fiavourable auspiccs, and the most pelfect certainty of an Lunfavourable resuilt. The Eastern Counties Rail-;vay is at the present moment in its clisis. The Chairman's party and the anti-Chairman's party Lave marshalled their forces, and are just now eneaged in the honourable task of inflicting the utmost sible amount of damage upon each other. From their gallantry and vigour they can hope to obtain ut one result-namely, the increased embarrassent of ihat great undertaking in which aU their terest5 are so largely involved. Now, if a mercantile firm or a banking-house ere conxducted on such a principle it -would - not equire any very profound knowledge of arith- etic to calculate the period of-its solvency. Afr. .cAn;4 in his recent volumes has drawn the ure of a Highland army, such as the one w=hick s for a while collected under the comnand VDcoist D-sMN:I. At any given moment there a a reaonable probability that the right centre ulturn its fire upon the left centre, - or that right wing, with a shriek and a yell, would sdown upon the left wing, even in the edt prSence of the enemy, upon some h rground which would scarce be intelligible , ,eraonwho .have the good. fortune to be born on g soutkward of the Highland line. This seems to , very muIch the case of our railway proprietaries k the prest moment. We grnt that the right -may be, and generally is, in1,5tlw firit,instanee, on the side of the dissident shareholdom. That which was right in. the beginning is, however, soon made winag by a2vience and exaggeration. A triunmph as -unexpeted. as. it was-.undeserved i given to their opponerds. The opinion is spread abroad that in railway matters: the adversaries are both as completely in the wrong as it is pFssible for persons to be who maintain diametrically opposite propositions. Meanwhile the money which the Proprietors had embarked in these undertakings, and from which they had every right to expect a reasonable return, is to thlem absolutely lost. Their own fortunes are injured, ,and the only consolation we can suggest to them is, that they are pre-euinently public benefactors. They are, indeed, of so liberal a 'spirit. that at their own proper costs and charges they have made and maintain the great lines of communication for the public benefit. At least, let 'their names be inscribed ingolden letters upon gorgeous tablets at the great central stations. They are surely as worthy of commemoratkn as those of the churchwardens who have erected an organloft or whitewashed a church.
THE REPAESENTATrON OF NEW1CASTLE-OX. TYNE. -W We stated on Thursday, upon pretty good authority, that it was the intention of lLr. Blacklett, one of the members of Newcastle-on-Tyne, to retire from the representation of the borough immediately Parliament met. On Saturday the following farewell address from the hon. gentleman was puilished:- "It is ithdeep regret I have to'inform you that my continued illness and constaut suffering render me incapable of longer performing the duties that belong to me as one of your representatives. Throrgh the whole of one session, with unexampled kindness, you have acquiesced in my unavoidable absence from the House of Commons. The hope vwhich I was encouraged to entertain of my illness being but of a temporary character has not been realized, and 1 now feelthat,with onlythe prospect of a remote recovery, it would be abusing your kindness and perilling your interests in Parliament if I were not to return into your hands the tiust which it has been my pride to hold. The pain I feel in coming to this resolution is in proportion to my sense of the honour which I received from you at the last election. Whatever may be in store for me-whether in health or sickness-whether in Parliament or out of Parliament-my best wishes and prayers will always be for the prosperity of my native towvn and the welfare of its inhabitants." Immediately on the publication of the above, the following address to the electors w.as issued by M1r. George Ridley, thle gentleman, who, we stated, would be brought forward by the Idheral party:- "The state of MJr. lackett's health havingunhappily rendered it necessary that he should resign his seat as one of yoiur representatives in the House of Commons, I beg to oder myself as a candidate for your T"ffi g; a m tI more encouraged to do so by the remembrance of the kind anid generous way inwhichl1 wasreceived by the inhabitants of your borough on a fornser occasion, when I was a candidate for the representation of South Nforthumberland. I continue stiU to entertain the political opinions which I advocated then, and which at that time gained for me so large an amount of support. In public life I should he guided bl those great principles of civil and religious liberty unaer -wich this nation has attained so high a degree of social and poEtical happiness, and by wihich it is daily increasing in wealth and prosperity. I look forward to the time when we shal be able to renew our endeavours to adjust the franchise in accordance with the increased intelliteace of the community, such a measure, in my opinion, teuig strictly consistent with the fundamental prineIples of our constitution. I am in favour of such weh-considered reforms in the several departments of administrative Gevermnent as experience has shown to be requisite and calculated to render more practicaUy efficient the conduct of public business. The war in which we are engaged is founded in justice. It was undertaken to preserve the inde,Cndencc of nations against the aggressive ambition of Lus-1sia; and although I should rejoice at the restoration of peace on terms to which this country could vith honour accede, yet, if this cannot be accomplished, I should give my hearty support to Lord Falmerston's Government in carrying on the war v'ith that energy and loyalty of purpCse 'which alone can bring it to a successful issue, and insure a peace coupatible with national honour and the perrcanent tranquillsty of Europe. Personally interested inthe prosperity or your borough, with which my family have l:een so long and so intimately connected, I shall have everyr iaidncement, if returned as one ofEyour representatives, to gise m y best attention to all such measures aws may tend to pm emote your vwelfare and advance your interests." It is reported that a requisition is now in course of si^natumre to Mr. Rlalph WValtn;, who in 1852, it will be remembered, contested the borough of Gateshead on ultra-rLiberal pminciples. The general opinion, howvever, is that Mlr. W.alters will not come forward, and that Mr. P.idsey will simply walk over the course.
A Cabinet Council was held on Saturday afterncon at the Foreign-office. The Ministers present wore Viscount Palmerston, the Lord Chalncellor, Earl Granville, the Earl of Harrowby, Sir George Grey, the Earl of Clarendon, MIfr. Secretary Labouclhere, Lord Panmnure, the Chancellor of the Emchequer, Sir Charles Wood, the Right Hon. R. Vernon Smith, Lord Stanley of Alderley, the Right Ron. 31. T.

Enopoan COLLEGE AT NEWcASns-uroy-Tna- It was stated in Te Times a few weeks ago that the mining enineers of the north of England prosed to found a colege in Newcastle, with a capital of at least 30,000!. It appceairs that this project is in proipeot of realization at no fistant period. t. Nicholas WYoodw, an eminent coal viewer, and President of the Mtining Inistitute, a short tine ago brought uinder the notice of the Dulke of Northumberland the intention to found a college, and requesting that his 012cc woul,d lend his asnistance to the movemnent, andbiecome patronof thecollege.The nobleDuke in answerto this appeal. signified to Mr. Wood, through his agent, Mr. Hugh Tayler that in case the amount of subscribed capita should reach 15,6000., his Grace would add 5,001. to that sum, malcidn it 20,000?. - and if it should reach 30,000., his Grace woua su=bseribe 10,0001., niaking 40,0001. This, as miglht be expected, has given an impetus to the design, and it is now intended forthwvith to apply to the other wealthy coalowners of this district for their support tothe undertaking. Application 'wil also be made to the leading manufacturers, as itis intendedthat the college shal give instruction in other branches of science besides those more immediately bearing on coal inig operations. In 'conexion with this design there is another of a kindred character about to be realized.: The library of the Literary and Philosophical -Society oE Newcastle is one of the most valuable-and eitensive in tienorth of England. The building which contains it wAn erected in 1825, at a cost of 12,0001., the foundation-stone having been laid by the late Duke ofSussex. This l3xary containg about 25,000 volumes, and it has been from time to time enriched- by mnay valuable preseris. -Mr. Robert Stepbenson, the eminent - engineer, abut two years ago, oftered topayone-balf of adebttheinstittionhag incurred, amounting to 6,200Z., provided the otier meabers of the soiet wold find means to p&y off twe etherhalf, and reduce the term of admission to one guimaperannum.

AMIERICA. [A'sulnma4 of the folioinvi,received by Electric Tolcgraph, appeared in our Seconld ditioa of Saturday:-] SOUTHMdPTON, JA.x. 2& The United States mail steamship Arago, Cap- tain Lines, with the French and English mails,; anrived off Cowes last night from Ne, York, en routte for Havre, bringing 60 passengers, $15,000 in specie for Havre, and a cargo consisting of 1,600 barrels of flour and 3,500 bushels of wheat. The rago experienced very boisterous weather during both the outward nnd homeward voyages. She left Cowes Roads December 20, and had a most boisterous passage of 16 days, arriving off Sandy Hook January 5, when, owing to a violent N.E. gale and snowstorm, she Wms compelled to stand off shore, and remained outside until the following day. When she reached the dock she was completely encased in ice; tle machinery, however, remained in perfect order. During the week that she lay in New York the weather was intensely cold, and large quantities of ice accumulated in the harbour, and on her departure she was several hours in working her way through it. The Aragoj experienced during thle passage easterly vwinds forj three days; in crossin,g the Banks, light winds; and from the Bankrs to the Channel the barometer was very low, rangging from 28 5-lOths to 29 inches most of the time, and W.S.W. to W.N.W. gales, with squalls of wind, rain, hail, lightning, and thunder. On January 18, in lat. 47.30, long. 47.30, she was several hours in passing throughalage quantity of large pieces of ice and small icebergs; at times she had to stop, and then steer all courses to I keep clear. This, no doubt, was old ice, which is considered very dangerous, the size and thickness precluding tlle possibility of its being this winter's formatibn. _ The Royal Mail steamship Canada arrived at Boston from Liverpool on the evening of the 10th inst., after a voyage of 20 days. The steamship Prometheus had arrived at New Orleans from San Juan with a fortnight's later news from San Francisco, Oregon, and Nicaragua. The intelligence from California is of no general importance. There were reports of an extensive Filibustering expedition having landed in Lower California. The San Franciscomarkets were dulL At O)regon the Indians had been very troublesome. Several sanguinay battles had been fought. Near I Walla Walla River Captain Bennett, Lieutenant Barrow, and tllree privates were killed and 14 wonunded- -At Pugot'o Sound LiuWuLeant Slaughter and several others had been illed. General WVool, however, was making arrangements for a vigorous campaign agtainstthe savages. Everytlhing was quiet in 9icaragua. The highiy important news respecting a revolution in NWicaragua and the defeat of W5alker, wvhich was published in aWashington paper, turns out to be a fabrication. The Northern Light left Saii Juan on the 4th inst. for New York, with $0,000 in treasure. Intelligence from Culba to the 28th ult, states that the Captain-General had paid a sudden visit to San Antonio, where he found the authoritics all engaed in fighting cocks, and witnessed some curious scenes before they got into official harness. Havannahw was I full of visitors, among whom was General Count Yermoloffi Holyday sports had completely interrupted trade. An attempt had been made to rob the cabin of the bark J. I. Morales, of New York, I but the thief wasarrested. MademoiselleRlachelhad a severe illness and harassing cougl, but her physicians thonght she would soon recover. Another batch of Africans had been landed, and another lot of political prisoners exiled. The Washington correspondents of the New York 1 papersa,gree mn announcing the rumolured retirementl of Mr. Crampton; and it wras assertced that he was arranging his affairs, preparatory to a speedy returnX to England. It ras likewise rumnoured that the American Goverunment has notified to Great Britain that lIr. Crampton would not be permitted to remain; and it vas furthermore stated tllat, in the event of his dismissal, the British Govermuent would have no further intercourse wvith the uJnited States, and that MIr. Buchanan will be presented with his passports. The voting for Speaker continued. On the last ballot Banks had 99; Richardson, 72; Fuller, 30; and Pennington, 9. In the New York Assembly Odel received 45 votes; Prendergast, 34; and Bailey, 36. There was no symptom of a surTender on either side. A despatch from Washington states that news from Nicaragua had been received by Mr. Mercoleta, to the effect that the Walker Government was in danger of being overthrown by a revolution party. It was said that Walker had been twice repulsed in conflicts. This news required confirmation. Mexican dates are to the 22d ult., and confirm the accounts already received as to the meIlancholy condition of Mexico. Disorganization, robberies, murders, and popular discontent prevailed all over the Bepublic. The Comonfort Cabinet gave tolerable i satisfaction, but it was thought that the President ! would not hold the reins of power long. The true Liberal party was at work in favour of General! Alnonte; and his system of government, on the plan of the United States-was likely to be tried. General Yanez, Comonforts War 3Minister, was on his way.! from Sonora to the capital. Yanez, as well as the majority of his official colleagues, is'a moderate i idberal. The measure of Alvarez for doing away I with the clergy and army exemptions vwas causing much dissatisfaction wherever its enforeemenii was attempted. When the military wvere employed in, posting the proclamation referring to it, in PuebMa, they Mwere attacked by the people ax? many were killed on either side. General Conionfort had! ordered 2,500 men to march on Puebla and " sul, due" it. It was thought thatVeraCraz-could-sc pronouncein favourof Robles. GeneiaUraa had refuse a post in the nlew Ministry. A snowstorm of unexampled severity visited the whole of. the Atla;ntic coast, from V5~ina to Hali- f'ax, on the 5th inst., and continuedi ra age from 15. t o 18 hours.

In t+he New York money-market foreign exchanges~ remained inactive, except for such. bills 'as were take ai by the leadingT bankers for remittance. Exchange w.^as quoted at 1084 to 1081. The stockmarket was L'elavy aind lower, although WithlOUt any regular breakL'W ownm prices. The provision-market sdull. 'ont9 was limited. The sales of the week are estinat.Â°d at 6,500 bales, chiefly parcels on the spot and to arve, and prices had been firmly maintained. New Orleans despatches quote: large' sales at z. to 9c. for middling.; one of the 8th givres receipts for thre e days only 12,000 bales, sales 40,000.-The export t o England was stiU- moderate as comparedwith the riCseipts, which appear to be steadily absorbed by dem -and from other quarters. In the grain-market co-sn was active. In consequence of the ,Canada's advices, a decline of [ fully $on.flour, and from- 2o. to Sc. on the common classes of wheat was established, but none on either corn or rye. The stck .at the-beginning of the year was computed at 60.9,000 barrels of flour -of all kinds, 800,000 bushels of wheat, 600,000:bushels of corn, and 200,000 bus7aels of rye. With the exception of flour, the stocks o?~l- other kinds of breadstuffis were very -moderate. hby the great I seveity, of the weather the supolie,so wheat and corn from the South were almost enmiIely stopped, .the rivers and 'creeks being frozen, avdzbyarilroad 'onlytrifles were being received; of floun-Ilie-zivalsby railroad amount to about 5,000 to 0lf)0 laurels a-day, and quite sufficient for home ccazunption; so that several hundred thousand barrels for- esx3rt' could be afforded until the navigation opmediapm. The impression, however, generally prevailbdi Utl after the turn of the year better accounts fromn the European grain-markets would be received, andionly -needy sellers wouild part with their stocks at present prices.

At Baltimore, Howardstreet, $84; City-mills, $8-.* to $V4. Wheat was scarce, and' held firmnly for prime quakties with the exception of Western - red, wimiela could be had on easier terms, say $1 90c. to, S1 95c. ; Southern, gl 97i-c. to $2; prime white wheat was held at from '$2 10c. to $2 20c.

Rye was held fimly; receipts from thriver were nil, and orders hadto be executed from store, but on account of the ice the loading was much obstructed. There were few sellers at $1 30c. in store, and most holders asked $;1 35c. to $1 40c. ?or spring delivery there were no sellers. At Philadelphian, Pennsylvania rye sold at from $1 20c. to $1 2ac. in store. Indian corn 'was dull, but shipping qualities of new Southern very scarce and held for90, to 92c. for white and yellow.

During the outward passage of the Canada the weather was sp bad that the watch had to get into the rigging to save themselves from being washed overboard. The Atlantic arrived at New York on the 13th inst., and the steamer Ericsson, from Havre, on the 15th.

The Wl'aslhington correspondent of the Herald writes on the 13th:- "A strong impression pervades political circles here that onr relations with Great Britain are threatening, and serious apprehensions are felt and expressed by many senators, several of them in the confidence of the Administration, of a rupture between the two Governments. It is evident that there must be a fight or a back' out on one side or the other." On the 14th the samie correspondent writes,- " The Presidenit has not repealed his original demand for the removal of Mr. Crampton. The British Government having assumed the respon sibility of explaining away the conduct of their Minister in the enlistment case, and our Govermnent having accepted their offer, the settlemeent of the affair is no longer with Mr. Crampton, who still continues his offilcial relations with the UnitedStates, but with the English Government. Lord Palmerston insists that sufficit explanation and apology have already been given to the United States, andour overnment with equal pertinacity insists on the contrary. On the disagreement on this point, all further correspondence between the txvo Governments has closed. The special message which the President has in readiness for the Congress will be found to sustain this statement. Nothing short of the removal of Mfr. Cranmpton by the British Government can prevent the affairs of the -United States aud England from assuming a more important and tllreatening attitude." The Heraad says - " It is reported that the Administration has sent out to the London Cabinet a positive demaud for the recaU of Mr. Crampton, the British Ambassador at Washington, and deelares its purpose, in the event of a non-compliance with its exactions, promptly to withdraw the excquaturs of Mr. Crampton, Mlr. Barclay, Mr. Mathew, and M1r. Rowcroft, implicated in the violation of our neutrality laws in enlistments for the British army in the Crimea." A letter from Washington says,- " It is reported here with an air of trnth that England,. rather than engage in a vwarwith the lUnited States on the Central American question, will recede from her assumed protectorate over the Bay Islands and Mosquito kinmdoin. it was incorrectly reported here that the last despatches sent to England w ere througlh Mr. Cram pton. If any have been rent recently, they wtent through the egular cCiannel, And despatches by the Canada indicate nothng of pauticular naportanee." The (cno'eier and Ehnquirer says,- "It is nowr certain that MIr. Buchlan.an has ben' inst;ructed to demand thec recall of M]r. Crampton for his complicity inthe enlistment of soldiers for the Crinea."

SECOiND EDITION. TRE VTIS OFFICEk, Moknday .Mo)nmg. E EXPRESS FROM, PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.: It is stated in offlcial quarter here, and without any appearance of doubt, that Pais ills b the seat of the peace negotiationx, which wiU not begin before the middle of Febrr;ary. The secletion of Paris is approved by Russia, Aushis., snd Enland. It is also afirxed that Lord endctir will be the Plenipotentiary, and, it is not dinicult te perceise that his nomination is received very fiouralAy The resident English Ambassador, Lord Comqq1 will, no doubt, assist hun in his task , but 1 beve nothing has been decided officially, as therewassome talk of leave of absence for a short timen having heen, wished, if not applied for. Count Orloffvillprobebly with M. Brunow represent Russia. Tha selection. of the former is received here with favo,r; and is looked upon as an indication of the reality of thh desire of Russia not to place obstacles in the-way of an arrangement. Count Orloff is describcd ls-a man of much moderation, and conciliatory in manne. Hee wasnays opposed to the war from t3Ubeginning, and did not hesitate to express opinions diWetricsay opposed to t.e Emperor Nicholar-in tle course of a policy which has ternminated so -MA, fOctanatelY.. M. de-:Buol will be charged with tre intarests of Astria, aided, nost probably, by tlj, experience- 4 M. Riiber. M. d'Azeglio and the. Ear.nis- de Vil-a Marina will be present for Sardinia. The Tnrldislr P[etiay, wvhose name I canneii just now call to msind, is not expected before tilnmiddle-of Febuary, ana,- of course, the negotiatfsns8. which' are- t. e conducted at the French Fereign-office; will not open before then. M. WalewAki. will, of course, repssellt France. He will most probably lhaiw a e0eague to assist him s; but on whiom the- choice wi1 fall is not yet decided; tnoug4. iM all probability, MI. d doeBourqueney will. be the man. Some, if not a' good deal Of diseussion, Wi necessarily take platee, but it is not anticipatea here that the result eill be otherwise than'pacific. W%hatever unwillingness, if there really exist any, may exist on the part of some- iamibers of the E glish Cabinet to make. rDeace on thepropositiosieacc1pted by Russia, will it is thoughthere, disappear as soon as Parliament meets. A private letter from Vienna enables me to correct a slight error in one of my previons comnmunicatiousj with respect to the time of the receipt of the despatch in that city of the acceptance by Russia. It wvas not in the forenoon, but at 5 in the evening that the news reached M. de Buol, and it was not in cipher.- Prince Gortschal;off had intimated his intention that he should leave Vienna for Dresden in, the event of Russia's definitive rejection of the propositions, and in the full confidence that such would be the case he had already made every preparation for his departure. Nearly at the last moment before the acceptance the Prince received a despatch from M. de Nesselrode requesting hibr not to go to Dresden, but to return forthvith to St. Petersburg. On. the evening of the 16th there was a ball at the Imperial Palace, but to which only the intimate friends of the Emperor and his famaily were invited. To such private reaunions the members of the Diplomatic Corps are not generally invited. The only one who attended on that occasion vas the Bavarian 211inister, as AXndtssade,n de farnic. It was renmarked that the Emperor could hardly contain his joy. His majesty became the centre of various groups successively, and himself announced the news, observing how Joyous all Germany, a-s well as Austria, should feel on the occasion. The disappointment and irritation of the representatives of several of the German States at Vienna are great indeed, and no pains are taken to conceal their feelings. They never could believe that Russia would accept such propositions. From these discontented persons I must, however, except the Prussian Ambassador, who goes about everywhere and tells to all who listen, and to all who do not listen, that it was Prussia, and Prussia only, that decided the Czar to accept. It will, I fear, detract from the sincerity of that diplomatist, or the Sovereign he represents, 'when it is known that wlhile M. de Werther4 the Prussian Minister at St. Pctersburg, was giving good advice to M. de NesseL rode, his colleague at Berlin, Count Amina, was urging the Cabinet of Vienna to content itself with the modified aeceptance of Russia, and to declare itself satisfied with the counter-proposition8 of M. de Nessehlode. This fact I learn on good authority. What M. de Buols real sentiments on that point were I cannot affirmn positively, but it is only fair to say that the younsgEmperor Francis Joseph at once rejected the pusillanimous suggestion and said, "Allor nothing." The "dodblejete" of Prussia will, I presumne, be an additional recomn mendation to her admission to the peace negoiiations ! From the momnent the unconditional acceptance of Russia was known at Vienna, Prince Gortschakoff has led a very retired life. He sees very few persons, and the Russians who interrupt his privacy only increase his irritation by their angry clamours against what they consider as the degradation of their country. This feeling exists everywhere, in Berlin as in the Austrian capital, and the maore violent hint at the artide unbiqte of the Russian Constitution wlhich has been tried vith some effect before on unpopular Autocrats. W"'hat that artide un.iTqe is it is hardly necessary to say. It is certain that a good many of the Russian nolbility at St. Petersburg and elsewhere wished for peace, and are glad of it even on the present conditions;. but there are many others who feel deeply on the subject. M. de Stackelbergis not less dissatisfied than Prince Gortschakoff, and only speaks of the shame that has illen on tlle empire, He also had more than once declaTed that it wss utterly impossible for Russia to accept the Austr5ian; propositions. In a former letter IT alluded to the strong hired expressed by the Russian Court and people ag;ainst Austria. That hatred has, if possible, -Lmome. more intense, and the assent given by the, Vienna.. Cabinet 'toP the CCrectificition" of tee. Otttoman territory, as already described, ilas added: to its exasperation. The unusually bold Wt taken by7 Austria will never be forgottn 'by Rw,ia and that step is by general consent tMributed prin,cipally, if not entirely, to the spirited young Emperor.

THE TUBKISH CONTINGENT. KEETCH, CRIEA, SAX. 6. We have been in daily expectation of the approacl of the enemy. Scouts had brought in word that an advanced guard (of 5,000 men) of a large army was within three hours' march of this plaoe. EDvery other wrork wlas laid aside, and the entire force was sent to trench work. YLenkale and St. Paul's are strongly fortified, and all around Kertch, from seaboard to seaboard, a fosse from 12 to 16 feet deep and six feet broad has been dug, and a rampart from seven to 12 feet high erected. Guns have been placed so as to command every direct approach, and there are now abundance of ammunition andprovisions enough to keep us from starving for several weeks to come. Better than al still, our troops are beginning to " show up" to greater and greater advantage daily. They are newly rigged out in their English uniform and long boots; they are kept hard at work, are well fed and well paid,-are sober, submissive, and extremely well behaved. They treat their officers with every respect; in fact, it is daily becoming more marked, and few would beieve that they are the same people who were but a short time since handed over to our rule. Of course amon,g so large abodytheremust bemany blacksheep. But crimeis the exception, not the rule; and wenow hear nothing of those horrible atrocities which made one's blood run cold toreadof during the "sacking' of Kertch." That the Turks are a bigotted, fanatic, ruthless race no one can deny; and it was a tremendous experiment, placing a handful of Europeans over thom to displace their old officers, and locating the force at a place far from aid of any sort in case of an outbreak, thereto upset their old customs, held by them in veneration, and introduce those of the more civilized part of the world. But such have lumn tho tact and judgment shown and the delicacy withwhich the curbwastightened and thenslackened that now their ways are daily approaching more to our ways, and a feeling of attachment between the men and their officers, many of whom are able to converse with them, is daily becoming more apparent. Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the chief who has brought about this state of organization; a more judicious selection could not possibly have been made. Notwithstandingthe immense amount of office work he has to doand you will allow that it is considerable when I tell you that he has to correspond with the home authorities, others at Sebastopol, stil more in the Sea of Marmora, General Smith at Shumila, and with the Polish Legion-stil I say, with all this, he is evervwhere seeing and judging for himself. He is held in high estimation by the French, but an uufortunate and most disag-reeable ill feeling exists on the partof theregular troops of Her Majestytowards theirregularsof the Contingent; and the officers have actually not had the civility to call on the gteneral, nor do the officers in any way associate. From the colonel downwards it is the same; and, if report be true, he has actuallydedlined to obey his orders, or done so with a bad grace. This division of authority and responsibilitymust necessarily paralyze combined action, and when the enemy does come we shall feel it. General Vivian is charged with tacitly "sanctioning the pulling down the few remaining houses in KertcK" The general order, which I enclose, issued immediately on his alrival here, is the best refutation of that cahunny. There is no reckless expenditure here, and the efficiency of the force warrants us in hoping that we may be of some service in this great war when the season opens, if the opportunity only be placed in our power. I am myself proud of the force good luck has happened to attach me to, and, like all others serving so good a master, I am very desirous to render my part of it as efficient as possible. Talk of Indian officers versts Queen's-why, there is at present almost an equal division of both. But among ourselves we know no distinctionperfect unanimity exists; all are actuated by one purpose-a desire for the welfare of the public service, and an eager wish to please a chief who, to use the words of your able correspondent at Sebastopol, "draws the reins gently, but rly, and corrects the evils which tend to mar the elciency of the force in the fieldj"-who-is ever ready to temper justiece with mercy, and who knows no friend but he who shows himself most zealous for the public good. The following is an extract from General Orders, dated the 23d of October, 1855:- "1No.4. The Lieutenant-General desires that an immediate stop be put to the destrmction of property of any description in tho ports of Kcrtch and Yenikale held by the British and Tnrkish troops, and calls upox the respective comumnders strictly to carry out this order."

Ition rS-t=rdav-I PARLS, FIDAmY, JAN. 25, 6 P.L In my letter of Stnday last, spealdng of the place that would be selected for the peace conferences, I mentioned that the French Government had not, and would not, demand Paris, but that, if proposed by England, they would make no objection. I believe I can now inform you that Paris is the place selected. The Emperor Niapoleon proposed to the English Government that London should be the pLace, and-the English Government, not to be outdone in courtesy, fixed on Paris, and expressed a hopa that no objection would be made. This choice, of course, gives satisfaction here, and has been readily acquiesced in by Russia. Each Government will, no doubt, put its best champion forward to represent it on the occasion, and the public voice seems to approve beforehand the choice that would be made of Lord Palterston, nor would Lord Clarendon be an nnpopular one. The Russian Government has fixed on M. Brutnow as its representative. It is not true, by the way, as has been stated, that an intimation has been made to Prxia that-her acceptance of the Austrian propositions is a sne qad won to her admission to the conferences. I believe no intimation has been made to her on the subject, and it is to be hoped that Prussia will be left in the same inglorious loneliness in which her own choice has placed her. I shoulld have saidthat the Russian Government previously ascertained that M. Brunow would not be objected to by England and France. M. de Buol is spoken of as the Austrian Plenipotentiary. SATURDAY, JA?. 26, 6 P.m The following private telegraphic despatches have been received 1 ViEN,.sA, Jan. 26.-The diplomat.c representatives of Austria have, it is said, received orders to formally disavow all that has been said on the subject of a pretended convention relative to the reconstitution of Poland under an Austrian Archduke. A ukase has just been published, open. ing the frontiers of the Russian empire to all the travellers against whom they have been closed since 1848." "BRRLIN, Jan. 26.-Holland, as well as Austria and Prussia, has been very urgent with Russia with a viewto peace. Serious doubt is expressed as to the existence of the circular of 3L do Nesselrode, to which is attributed an unfavourable interpretationof the acceptance of the Austrian propositions." "1aESoURG, Jan. 25.-A now loan, amounting to 600,000 silver ronbles (2,400,000f.), is about to be levied on Finland for the expenses of the war." "' YADRiD, Jan. 25.-The Government of the Qneen has raised to the rank of Lieutenant-General Major-Generals Leynerich, Ruiz, and Prim. xL Corradi is appointed llEnister Plenipotentiary in PortugaL The establishment of the Credit Society of Catalonia will be authorized." By a recent decision of the Minister lof War, the soldiers whose time of service expired on the 31st ult. are to continue in their respective corps until they be replaced by the recruits of the class of 1856. A similar measure was adopted last year as respects the soldiers of the class of 1847, and the Emperor, to compensate them for that additional service, grantedthemaninmrease of pay from the day they were entitled to liberation. The same favour is to be enjoyed by the men of the class of 1848. The Court of Correctional Police of Lyons tried, on the 23d, four persons accused of having clandestinely imported seditious publcations into France, and among others, M. Felix Pyat's letter to the Queen of England. They wore, it appears, forwarded from Geneva in double-bottomed casks. Three of the accused were sentenced5to two, three, and six months' imprisonment, and the fourth was acquitted. The Mangoesn publishes the retun of the procuce and consumption of beetroot sugar since the opening of the season, from which it appears that there were 273 manufactories in operation on the 1st of January, 1856, or 66 more than at the corresponding date of 1855. The quantity of sugar manufactured, including 2,359,141 kilogrammes lying over since last year, was 53,826,827 kilogrammes, or 17,339,364 miore than in 1854. The sugar sold for consumption or deposited in the Government bonding stores amounted to 38,050,255 kilogrammes, being a difference in favour of 1855 of 16,652,093 kogrammes.

Exchange on THE MEDIERANEAN. MARSEILLES, JAI. 24. The people of Marseilles have been gratified this week with the sight of Russian cannon captured at Sebastopol. The steam-frigate El Dorado arrived here onTuesdeay, fromToulon, and yesterday she landed many pieces of Russian artillery, brought by her from Kamicech. They consist of numerous heavy iron guns, with their carriages, and some bronze pieces of smaller calibre. The iron guns appear to have seen much service, and are greatly damaged; the brass guns are in good order. They are stamped with the dates of 1816 and 1830. Enormous quantities of shot and shell have arrived from the Crimea, and are piled up in huge pyramids in the Artillery-ground. Provisions of all kinds, with wine and brandy, continue to be forwarded to the army in the East, and a plentiful supply of hay for the cavalry. The weather continues to be tempestuous in the Mediterranean, and accounts are daily received of shipwrecks on the coast. Seventeen vessels are aground between Cette and Port Vendres. The Spanish steamer Newa, Captain Valspinosa, which sailed from Barcelona for Cette on the 12th inst. with a cargo of wine and wool, experienced a hurricaie of more than ordinari violence on the 14th, and was thrown on the coast near St. Cyprien, at the mouth of the Tech. The captain endeavoured to bear up for Port Vendres, but a heavy sea broke the wheel and carried away the binnacle. The passengers and crewv (33 in number) were providentially rescuedfrom their perilous position by the exertions of the inhabitants of St. Cyprien and the Coast Guard.. They had scarcely reached the shore when the Coast Guard announced another ship aground. She proved to be the brig' Ars~ne, of Marseilles, from Oran for Toulon, with a general cargo. She struck at a hundred yards from the steamer. Further accounts from Port Vondres, of the 20th inst., announce the loss of the French brig Heuriette, with a cargo of wheat from Gigelly, in Africa, for Marseilles. The ship ws literally dashed to pieces on the roks by the violence of the winds. Tshe crew was saved, with the exception of One boy. A: letter from Bastia, in Corsica, of the .18th inst., announoes the los3 of a ritish bri,g, laden with forage for the Crimea. Of the crew of 11 men oy two were saved. The mail steamer Progrs, from Marseilles to Bastia, was forced torns for Africa. Immense supplies of wheat and flour continue to arrive at reilles from the Vnited States. TheUfniverse arrived yesterday fkom New York, whence she sailed, on the 25th of November, with 5,242 barrels of fliour and 5i,934 bushels of wheat, on account of the French Government. The corn-market continues to decline, with little business doing. -A letter from Toulo, dated this ming an nouncestlie arriv.i d-4t1t;port of thep-o-the'line'~Jena; frfoni- KiinieSc, and the steamfrigate Dirien,I fronm ainiesc, with 150 uili*t. pas .i Siesaler.-i'.C: *. - - '-:' .- SP ' Senor Rivero's animadversionson the politiWl course of the Government in a democratic sense lasted for two hotirs, axd broiught out aU tlio Mi- nisters,' including the DIuke de la Victoria, and the sittng was prolonged till 8 p.m. to get rid of the subject; but they led to no result, and no proposition was submitted O as to allow a vote to be taken on any. part of the subject; but Senor J. B. AIlonso, who has been 'dismied from a post held under the Govermment for voting against the latter on Senor Sagasti's proposition, announced that he would bring the question forward again on the first day set aside for interpellations, kc. Some erroneous statements have found their way into the journals respecting the Cr&lit Mobilier Company here and other schemes; one journal gives a full list of directors of the former scheme, and anether speaks of the probability of a junction taking place between that and another projected association of Spanish firms, both of which have just obtained concessions fromtheCortes. I understand that as regards the latter object-i. e. the union of the Credit Mobilier and Spanish Companies-there is this slight foundation for the report, that the idea of a junctionwas suggested by General Concha, Marques del Duero, in a spirit of conciliation ; but it iseonsideredas impossible tobe realized, from the different iiews entertained by each company regarding the objects to be aimed at, andI am informed that it is quite given up. With respect to the directors of the Cr6dit' Mobilier Company, .I learn that the names put forth are quite imaginary-that, in fact, the parties in Paris will be consulted before anything be done in the matter, and the only three directors who have as yet been named are M. Osma, late Minister of Peru, and a resident here; Count Vegamar, and Mr. O'Shea. The president miust be a Spaniard, but no one has yet, I believe, been fixed on for that office since the death of the Duke of Sotomayor. The Marquis of Miraflores would have been considered in every way a suitable person to be applied to but for his particular position as regards political matters. The conferences going on between the Tarif Com. mittee and the commissionera who represent the different interests affected by the proposed tariff reform are hield daily. Cottons have been got through, and woollens are now under discussion. The agents of the manufacturers maintain that the proposed protective duties of 25 per cent. are quite inadequate, and propose 35 per cent, at least. The discussion on this subject will be resumedto-day; and a deputation of rIadrid cloth dealers and tailors and other persons connected with the trade in rmade-up clothes have desired to be allowed to show the injurytheir trades would sustain from tariff reform, particularly as regards made-up clothes. Senor Calatrava, president of the Tariff Committee, appointed to-morrow for the purpose of hearing their observations. Colonel Cardero, Governor of this province, has, in conformity with the directions of the Honie Minister, formed a board, or junta, composed of deputies for the province, members of the provincial deputation, corporation, &c., for receiving requests for work, classifying the petitioners, and destining them to the works already commenced, or about to be commenced. The 50,000,000 reals applied for as an extraordinary credit by Senor Luxan for roadmaking will give employment to a good mnany people, and aboout 400 men will be set about repairing roads in this province by orders of the Government, while the corporation of M ridwi furnish similar emnployment to many others. The funds are rather lower to-day. The Three per Cents. are quoted at 36 20, and the Deferred at 23 5.
T2HE NEWS OF PEACE IN FPAAWE AIM IN ENGLAND. (From the ERwih.i"s,r. To judge by the tone of the French tress (no very good criterion certainly, but the tone of aDlpnvate letters is the same). our neighbours are cnn p bored at the supposed approach of peace;* and it is ma3de a subject of reproof to us on this side the Channel that we do not display the isae enthusiasm. Thereare,however, agreatmany excusesfor the absence of so much ardour of expectatiou on Our side; just as there are agreatmany undeniable reasons that should fairly render peace at te present moment, and under the conditions proposed, more acceptable to the French than to us. The French have immensely gained by the present war. We say it in no spirit of envy,but as amatterof honestcongratulation. Before the war began, French influence had not much weight in the Levant, nor in the eyes of Eastern nations did France take the rank which was reallyher due. Orientals judge only by events which have passed in their latitudes, and in tTis respect our friends and allies had been at some disadvantage. But this is no longer the case. France has sent 100,000 men through the Bosphorus. Their crowded legions have shown themselves in rapid succession inthe portor on the hils of Constantinople itself To them has manly fallen the glory of the successful storniing of SebastopoL Thereisnolonger the fear that in anynego tiations affecting national interests in Syria, EgPypt, or' elsewhere, the Turks can ever hereafter be indifferent to the power and the friendship of the French. We say all this without grdgilng to tha great people any one of the advantageswhica theybave nobly earned, and to which they are fuliy entitled. But, in admittin that they have gained al they sought or could desire in the Crimea, let us not affect to conceal what we English have lost. A predominant interest with us in this war was not merely to strengthen the Ottoman empire on the side of Europe, but on that of Asia. Russia, by her encroachmeats and conquests south of the Caucasus, has nob only mastered Persia, but inflicted danger and material loss upon Turkey. What have we done to conteract this ascendancy, or evento demonstrate'to the Asiatic Powers and tribes that. we are able to make astand against it? We have alloweed the conquest of Kars; we have tolerated the intrigues and' ananceuvres of Persia in favour of the Czar; we have quietly seen Herst taken, and the British Envoy obliged to retire from Teheran; and all thletime we have utterly failed in making any use wfhatever of the boasted symnathies, good dispositions, and power of the Circassians. *edsrye The forts .and raised the blockade of their country, yet have managed matters so ingeniously that in return theyhave not fired a shot or wielded a scimitar for us We were told that at any time Schamayl, by menacing Tiflis, might recal the chief forces of Russia from the extremity of Georgia; yet General Moucavieff perserved for months in besie"ixr l<iar, and not only werewve unable in anywVay to effect a diversion, but we utterly lost one of the noblest opportunuities for a triumph of the last importance which lay ready to our hand, and wihich the skill and valour of our own countrpmen had prepared for us. We are not now entering into any consideration of the causes of al this. We are simply explaining the manifest reasons why Englishmen do not welcome peace with that exuberant content which overflows very naturally from the bosoms of the French. On the one side, the French have gained enormously in political weight through this war. On the other, our salutary powerand infltence-we say salutary, for we would exert it on behalf of peace, and not for conRkuest or aggression-have diminished precisely in those regions where it most wanted increase and confirmation. It may be that Russia, by the negotiations on which she has now entered, sincerely as well as formally abdicates her: design of augmentingher territories in Europe. But she may also do this with the secret resolve of indemifying herself in Asia, and of directing south of the Caucasus the aggression which has been repelled from the Danube and the Euine. We have played her game if this be so, for it is now more practicable andeasy than it was at the opening of the struggle. So far we have been considering only to what degree the state in which this interrupted war leavesAsia maynot unfairly have its effect upon the thinker and the politician, in diminishing his ardour at the prospect of such a peace. Bnt in this we have not comprised a more popular, if not more dangerous, ground of discontent. The people generally are dissatisfied that the Redan assault should harevbee tht last ineffective blow struck by England. They are thoroughiy discontented with the management and conduct of great naval expeditions, undertaken at enormous cost and ending in quite inadequate results. All this has led to a feelin which may in its turn probably lead to manifestations rather startling to our peace negotiators, whether or not their pacific lahours be successfuL The extent to which, with us, a navy and an army can be kept up in time of peace, must hereafter depend more entirely upon the strength of the good opinion the public may have of the waT i whch they are manaed and administered. No one is blind to the distrust and deep discontent which prevails at present on this head; and what anaother camoaign's sucecess might have done for cur military and navalwdepartments, the willnow have t o for themselvesfndertialsand difficulties of no ordinaryind. The minister who basnot coerage to look steadily in the face those thorough changes and reforms which will now be damoronsly demanded, or who thinks it possible'- to avail himnself of any amount of satisfaction caused by the cessation of war to get back armv and navy to the old stationsay system, wcill soon find his peace laurels wither. ' w h b Notwithstadingrall these considerations, howwever, the relative condition of england and crance in the presence of the pealce negotiations may faitly excite some surprise. When we consider that wvar has brought -no material ia crevse of direct taxationh in e ante, we may wonder at her sighing for peace uder 'burdens so comparatively lght, whileEngland,soheavily txe, can yet in,dulge in the exuberance of a disinterested ardour.

. TURY3:Y. 110.11,11,11111"hlllIllw 1. (FROM OUR20 W2s ODzsMPONDEM.1 CONSTANTINOPLE, JAN. 14. The more the particulars of the rupture betweenL the British mission at Teheran and the Court of Persia become knownthe more the opinion is ganing ground that Mr. Murray's retreat was precipitate. This was, up to a certain point, to be attri. buted to the circumstances under which heoasumed hispost. His predecessors had succeeded, by their meddling and vexatious policy, in alienating most completely the sentiments of the Perians, and had left him in the difficult dilemma either to espouse their quarrels, or else to break entirelywith the traditions of the mission and begin altogether a new line of polcy. Without a previous mnowledge of the country, or any one to advise him, it was diffcult, if not imposible, to adopt the latter alternative, especially as he was surrounded by thosa who had not only taken an active part in tlhe past policy, but had essentially contributed to form it. The frst reason put forward by the Persian Governuent against the appointment of Mirza Hashint was that he had not been regularly dismissed from the office which he had held before, and that, consequently,he belonged still tothe Shah's Court,and, as a Persian employg, was incapable of actig as an English agent. Having taken up this ground, the Persians endeavoured all along to give to the affair a domestic character and to maintain that the appointment was an interference with the internal affairs of the Persian Court, to which. the man belonged both byhis position and his maxiage. The arrest of tLj lady is a proof of this. lSot being able to touch the husband, who had taken refuge at the British mission, his wife was carried off by the family. It was not the Persian Government, but her brother, who took her away. In Oriental countries a woman by marrying does not entirely cease to be a member of her family; the latter is still supposed to watch over her. This is much more the case when a Princess marries. Then it is rather the husband who becomes a member of the wife's family. So as to the right which the brother had according to Oriental custom to carry off Mirza Hasbim's wife there can be no doubt, and it is only the time chosen for the execution of this intention and the manner in which it was done which are open to objection. It shows the animus of the Persian Court that, having ignored the lady's escapades before, it chose just the moment when the quarrel about the appointment of her husband was pending to alloW, or very likely to prompt, her brother to use his family right. Besides, the lady was carried off from her tent, which was pitched near the house of the Embassy, which added to the grievance. Another proof which the Persian Court gave of its intention to look at the matter as an interference in internal affairs was that the Shah himself, who never openly interferes in anything connected with the Government, wrote two autograph letters to Mr. Murray on the subject. They were written when MIr. Murry claimed the restoration of the lady to her husband, and it is an expression in one of these letters which precipitated the crisis. Mr. Murray, or rather his interpreters,that is, the people who were the original prompters of the whole quarrel, by recommending 3Mirza thaobim-thught they perceived in this phrase an allusion to personal motives in the wish of 1r. Murray to get the lady back. From that moment the correspondence became more violent than ever, and the rupture took place. The following is the Persian offlcial statement, published in the Teheran Gazefe:- " The Persian Govermaent, in consequence oEf the anxiety produced among the people by the interruption of the friendly reations between the Court of Teheran and the British mission, declares, for the tranqullization of all abroad and at home, that this circumstance, which was caused by the strong and dangerous pretensions put forward by lr. Murray, the British Minister, will not at all di- inish the friendly relations between Persia and England, or affect in any way tho neutrality of the Persian Court. The neutrality of the latter will remain firm and unchanged as hitherto, and the remaining Ministers of the alled Powers will be the witnesses that this cirn-ntance has had no effect on the neutrality of the Persian Court." From this declaration it is clear that there need be no apprehension of any complication on account of this untimely event; yet the sooner this absurd affair is arranged the better it will be for all parties; Constantinople would be, perhaps, the most convenient place to do this. I wrote to you about establishing a well orgauized police in Pera, of which the necessity makes itself every moment more and more felt. I hear the English French, and Sardinian military authorities are quite agreed about the measures to be taklen; but they find in their way the same stumblmg,block whiach the poor Turkish police long since gave up the idea of surmounting-namely, the privileges of the Ambassadors, MAinisters, and Charges dAffaires of a score of great and small Powers. There would be naturally no difficulty in making an arrangementwiththetwogreatEmbassies, but it would be a flagrant violation of international law to interfere with the jurisdiction of someCharg6s d'Aflhires, who woulld be thus deprived of the only little authority which they are ever called upon to exercise. So the matter rests with the diplomatic corps. On Wednesday last a kind of preliminary conferenceetokplaee atthehouseof theGrandVizier,Aali Pasba, about the fourth point-namely, the position and rights of the Christians in Turkey. The Turkish Government is said to have taken a very liberal view of the suibject, -which gives hopes that this important matter will lead to a satisfactory result. Preparations areiikewisemadefor the conference3 about the Danubian Principalities. They will probablybegin in i0 days or a fortnight. As the seveu years for which Prince Stirbey was elected will expire next May, it is important that matters should be settled before that period arrives. Several letters from Rustchuk and Giurgevo speak of a collision between the Austrian and Turlish soldiers garrisoning the latter town, in which two of the former were killed. Both garrisons were called to arms, as the quarrel threatened to assume a serious character. In the two letters which I have seen no particulars of the cause of the collision are given, only the excitement prevailing on both sides is described as very great. Officers arrived yesterday from Kertch say that the apprehension of a Russian attack has not altogether subsided. The health of the troops is unparalleled; in one division of the-Turldsh Contingent, numbering 4,000 men, only 24 are in hospital. The ice offers no im-pediment to the communication wt the vessels, which are lying on the edge of it, and are approached by sledges. ThePiusse d'Orient contains several lettersfirom Kinburn up to the 7th of this month. As at Kertch, they are expecting an attack there. From 25,000 to 30,000 Russians are said to be concentrated in Oczakoff and Cherson, and preparing to atack the place. In consequence of these rumours the French General of Artillery, Leliceuf, has beenb sent there by Marshal Pelissier with reinforcements, and several vessels wvith ammunition; the flotilla has likewise been augmented by several steamers, which are placed so as to sweep the approaches from the land side. Two Russian soldiers have been taken in a sortie while ascertaining the thickness of the ice. They agree about the intended attack, and say that the guns have been put on sledges, and the soldiers shoes providea with pointed nails, to be able to walk on the ice. Hitherto nothing but some reconnaissamces has taken place, and those always at a distance. On the 27th of last month 50 or 60 horsemen, escorEing the sledaes, approached the lines, but some shells and the %alls of the riflemen soon drove themn away. tHALF-rAST 3 P.M.

COURT OF QUEENS BENCH. WESrTZSP JANT AS NICHOLSON .1I%D ANOTFrlTT V a<c'rr IdMingi Banco, '_ore Lord CAMPBzLL and JUatke Co maw:. WIantA, and CRompTo.) This was a special case for the opinion of this Court. It appeared thata person named Lodge had been a member of the Stock-Fxc=he ad eupged largely in speculi,tions termed " time bargains"-v, purchases and sales of stock, to be supplied and pidfor on afutureday, or to be settled at " the account' by thepayment of "differences." 3eing a loser by these speculations, it became evident to him (Lodge), that on the next account day, the l0th of ?Tovensler, he would be unDable to meet his engagements on .the Stock-Exchange. Be therefore gave notice on the morning of thtdythat he was a " defaulter," and was posted as such in the usual manner. Accorintg to the rules of the Stock-Exchange, -wvhen a member becomes a defaulter he is bound to deliver up his bookS, &c., to an officer of the Stock-Exchange called he " official assignee," whose duty it then becomes to collect all sums due to the defaulter from members of the Stock-Exchange, and to distribute the same, without any regard to the creditors out of the house, among his creditors in that body.. The defendant in the resent action was the official assignee of the StockIELxchange, and as soon as the bankrupt had been de- clared a defaulter the defendant proceeded to collect the 'Eankrupt's debts to the extent of 11,000. and upwards, itsd distnbuted the same according to the rules of the Stock-Exchan"e among the bankrupts creditors in that body. i'he defaulter had since been adjudged a bankrupt Upon an act of bankruptcy committed on the 9th of November, the day before he becaime a defaulter, and, assignees having been subsequently Iapointed, they brought the p resent action against the ucial ashee of the Stock-Exchange torocoverthe moneys vnichhehiAreceivedfroithebankruptlsdebtorssin orderthat the money niught be distributed for the benefit of the general body of the bankrupt's creditors. The action was in form for moneyhadandreceived bythedefendanttothe Rlaintif's 'use. Among other pleas the defendant pleaded-first, that e was never indebted; secondly, that before he had any 'notice of any act of bankruptcy he had paid avay the roney; and, thirdly that the bankrupt was a 3nember of the Stock-Exciange and subject to its rules; that 'ie had become a defaulter, and that the defendant, as official assignee, had distributed the money to the extent of lOs. 6d. in the pound among the bankrupt's creditors in the Stock-Exchange, and had paid over the balance of 13WS. 6s. 9d. to the fund for decayed members, accordin, to the rules. At the trial, which took place some time since .before Lord Campbell at Guildhall, some evidence as given to show the nature of the bankrupt's transactions, which were what are called " time bargamns," to be settled by the payment of "differences," on the "account." On the part of the plaintiffs, it was contended that the money so received and distributed by the defendant was money belonging to the bankrupt, which he had paid by way of fraudulent preference to his Stock-Exchange creditors, and thatit would be recovered back as money had and received by the defendant to the plaintifl? use, to be by them distri. buted among the general creditors of the bankrupt. But, on ehe part of the defendant, it was contended that these transac. ions were illegal witbin the 8th section of SirTohn Beriard'sAct (the 7th George IL, chap. 8), intituled "An act prevent the infamous practice c. stockiobbing '' and that he money, consequently, never was the money of the bankupt5 and cold not now be recovered by his assignees. The ection said, "And whereas it is a frequent and mischievous rutice for persons to sell and dispose of stocks or otber ecurities of which they are not possessed, it is enacted that contracts and agreements whatsoever which shall be ade orenteredinto forthe buying, seln ing, or ansfering of any public or joint stck or stocks or otber mblic securities whatsoever, or of any part, share, or interst therein, whereof the person or persons contracting or ceeing, or on whose behalf the contract or agreement hail be made, to sell, assign, and transfer the same, shal ot,atthetime of the makiDg of such contract or agree. ent, be actually possessed of or entitled unto in his, her, or heir own right, or in his, her, or their own name or names, r in the name or names of a trustee or trustees to their ise, shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatoever." The section then went on to render every peson o contracting liable to a penalty of 500t., and the broker egotiatin" such contract to a penalty of loaf. &lr. J.A1v'sr, QC. (w,ith vhom was .r. C. rollock), on e part of the plaintiffs, contended, in the first place, that here was no illegality in the bankrupt's transaction ; and econdlly, if there was, as soon as the money had been volu- y paid to the defendant, it became money had and reeived to tbe bankrupt's use, end could now be recovered by i.assignees. air F. TsrSIGP.sx (with whom were Mr. Hugh Hll, QC, ud Mr. Muliwood) contended thatthe contracts were clearly egal under the 8th section of the 7th George IL, chap. 8, d void. The money never was the money of the bank. pt, and could not be recovered by his assignees in this Lord CQUtPBELL said that the Court would take time to asider their decision. T'I QrxS. V.

The horse gave a plunge or two and fell dead, upon which the plaintifs maan said to Walte*s, tbat he was on his wrong side. Walters replied that he was a "liar," and drove on vwithout WLitiD to see the consewences of the accident. Theplain-- tiff hdcaled upon the efendant at his office in Stroud a few days after the accident occurred, and asked about his horse, which, he said, had been ldlled by the defendant's servant in consequence of his negligent driving. The defendant replied, that he had heard that one of the plaintiff's horses had been kllled, but that neither were the horse and gig his, nor was the accident the fault of Walters, who was driving very slowly on his right side, taking the horse to the stable. The pl;intiffsaid, they had better have another meeting and confront the two men for the purpose of see;ng which cf themn was telling the trnth. The defendant agreed, and appointed the following Saturday for the meeting, but he never epthis appointment. Thevalneof the horseinquestion was from 181 .to 20., and the total loss to the plaintiff, including the amount of business he had been unable to do inconsequence of having no horse, was 30L. The defendant had ordered and paid forthe livery worn by Walters, and had hired the dogcart from a coachbuilderat Stroud. A very great number of witnesses were called in order to mnke out the plaintiff's ca.e. The case, as stated by the counsel for the defendant, vw that a 31r. Wise, being engaged in executin the works of the South-Eastern Railway Company at 'Stroud as their contractor, had engxged to supply the company with 500 horses in the year, which he was to keep, to be used in their waggons, cwrts, &c. The defendant was to have one of these horses aud a driver constantly in attendance upon him in order that he might travel from one part of the works to anotherwithout loss of time, as it was necesary for him to do in his position of superintendingengineer. Accordingly, the man WValters as sent regularly every day by Mr. Ise to attend upon the defendant w,ith a horse, and at first with a gig, hut thatnot answering the purpose for which it was wanted,the railway company had requested Mhr. Harrison to get a carrige of ho the entering into an reement to pay him Ii. per month. The man WValters, therefore, was tbo servant of Mr. Wise and not of lMr. Harrison, and, under these circumstances, it was contended that the plain. tiff was not entitled to recover againstthe presentdefendant. In support of the defendant's case,the deed of contract between Mlr. Wise and the South-Eastern Railway Company was pnut in to show that MIr. Wise had undertaken to suppry the horses which were required, including the one furnished to the defendant. The deed consisted of nearly 200 skins of parchment, beautifully engrossed, andapparently a complete lIga in,trument, but it turned out that no stamp ha been aied to any of the sldns, andto make it a valid deed it was requisite that apenalty of 101. should be paid, exclusive of the price of the stamp on each separate skin. This portion of the evidence had consequently to be withdrawn, as the parties were not anxious to pay betw:,en 2,0001. and 3,000l.. the sum in all probability the stamps and penalties would amount to. Several wbitnesses having been called, The counsel addressed the jury for their respective clients. His Ionvswsp, in summing up, said that he should direct the jury to find their verdict for the defendant on the second plea, with leave to Mr. Hawldns to move to enter the ver- dict for thejplainbiflf upon the facb. As the fhequestion of negligence, he should leave that to the jury;* if theythought the negligence v;as on the part of Walters, then they must sayto what damages they thought the plaintiff entitled;* if otherwise, their verdict on that point must aLso be for the defendant.

COURT OF EXCREQUM S&TRDAY. JAN. 26. 1EWSTONT V. PLLIPs. (Si&z1eu in Banco.1 Mr. MsWAID moved for a prohibition to the Judge of the LiverpooolCounty Court in this andtwoother cases, on the grcund that they did not fall vithin his jurisdiction. The plhint was brought under the 65th section of the 9th and 10,h of Victoria, chap. 95, which gave the County Courts jurisdiction to try suwts for "any legacy under a will,"and it was now contended for thedefendant that the case did not fall withinthatsection. -It appearsthatin1839 armandied, and by his will he gave certain furniture, goods, and debts to the defendant (who was his executor), in trust, to sell and realize the same, and invest 1001. and the interest thereon, until the plaintiff (his nephew), then aminor,shouldcomeof age, andthen upon trust to pay him the same, with power to advance the whole, or any portion, if such a step should be desirable. A similar provision -was also made for two sisters of the ;laintiff, to the extent of 60L At the death of the testator the mother of the children was "on the parish," and the defendant made from time to time certain advances for the support and benefit of the children, which exhausted all the funds; and when they came of age they each brought an action in the County Court against the defendant, to recover so much of their respective legacies as fell within its juisdiction, abandonmng the excess beyond that sum. The learned judge, on objection being made, stayed execution, in order that this role might he discussed, and it .was nowv argued for the defendant that the section of the act only appEiedto the case of a mere legacy, where nothing remnained to be done but for the executor to hand it over to the legatee. In the oreset case, however, the esecutorwas clothed with a complicated trust, and the legatees. by the p rocess of the County Court, wrere virtually suing himn for a oreach of the trust. 3fr. ASPLsD showed cause a"ainst thewrule inotheifst instance, and cited " Spears v. Wilson"' (6, Exbh. Reports, p. 833), where this Court held that a sum given to an ese. cuter i trust to pay to the legatee was a legacywhich could be recoveredf i the County Court. 3rr. ArDWABD, in reply, relied on the subsequent case of "iBe Fuller" (2, ceis and Blackbursn's reports), where the decision of this Court ws explained, and shown to be quite in accordance with the present contention of the defendant, and the distinction drawn between a leg,acy in the hands ot an executor and one in the hands of one who was both executor and trustee, in which latter case the legatee could oul W resort to equity. dhe Conors was of opinion that the distindion so taken was -we founded, and that in the present case the County Court had no jurisdicion. The rule for a prohibition must therefore benade absolute in each action. Judgment atcordingly. NEVr TPix PAPZR.-WATLIKG V. Et.. Thi wasarne fora newtrial onaflidavits. The action was brought to recover damages from the defeudant for not makg reasonable exertions to raise the vessel of the plaintifhf, which hadgone ashore on "the Brambles San,"in te Solent Sea, in pursuance of his engagement so to do, and for falsely and fraudulently representing to the plaintifls that the ship could not -oe raised, and thereby inducing them to sell her as a wreck At the trial before Mr. Justice rslliabns, at Wrichester, ith appeared that the vessel in question, which was laden with coal for Southampton, having gone ashore in heavy weather, the agent of the plaintifSs appliedn to, and employed, the defendant, adhois manager of ane SofthauIpton Steam-tug Company, to raise her, and it was agreed that he should receive 60a. for three attempts, and 2he. morea if he was successful The .efendant did nmke three attemPts, but, ashe alleged, they all failed y reason of the vessel having settled down into a complete d-ock, and thereueon, her cargo and fithtigs having ofeen removed, the plamtsff put the hull up to auction about eight days after, when she was bought by the dlefendant for 21aS agre wreck. To the surprise of the plantiff;b however, the vessel soon after made its anpear. ance at Southampton in perfect order, and it *as ascertained that the defendant had-succeeded in raising her without any difficulty whatever. Inwspport of thev serious charge against the defendant, a ran named Ste was exaniined, who proved that on the final attemptar. sawt the defendant knock out a belt in-a chain by winch a buoy was attached to the vessel, just as she was about to float out of . the "dock"-a step which frustrated the attempt as a matter of course. This act the defendant deniedon oath. The plaintiffs further relied on the extreme facility with which the defendant ultimately raised the ship, and onthefactthathe had sent a man -teo ascertain her conditiou, and,-had learnt that he could easily raise her in conecquen*e of a change in the wind on the night before the sale, and had not communicated his information -to the pJaintas proof that be had been actuated by a fraudulent eVnftu ghout the affair.

The prisoner was indicted for that he, being in the service of the Crown, received a large sum of money, to wit 5,a0001, und did steal the same. It appeared that tLe prisoner was employed in the collection of inland revenue in Cheshire; it was his duty to receive the same, and to account for it and pay it over to the surveyor when he came round. On the 13th of September the suveyor called on him and showed that he had received 5,2141., and asked ii he was prepared to payit; the prisoner replied that he was not. The surveyor then reminded him that he had not paid 30(K which he had received for Excise duties on the previous Mionday. The prisoner then took out 2551., a check for 551. 8s. 4d., and a post-office order for 14s., and said that was all the money he had in the world. The surveyor asked him what he had done -with the rest. The prisoner said he had spent it in an unfortunate speculation. It was objected that there was no evidence of the receipt and misappropriation of any particuar sum of money; he could not be convicted under the 2d of William IV., chap. 4, which made him liable to be traisported for 14 years. The case was tried before Mr. Justice Cresswell, who reserved the point made by the objection. Mr. BALLAN!I-Th2 now appeared for the prisoner, and contended that, unless the prisoner was convicted of embezzling a particular sum, he might be indicted over andover again forstealing particular sums on particular days, and could not plead that ha had been before tried for stealing those particular sums. Ihe Covstr.-If those sums were included in the account showing a balance of 5,2141., he could plead that. The prisoner was charged wiith a felony becauise the art made at a felony. Mr. BAr NTmE said, if this conviction wassustained the prisoner might have been convicted of a hundred different acts of embezze'ment, lthough onlythree charges were allowed to ho included in one indictment. Mr. Justice COLFRT71GE-If a person bad put three different sums of 201. into a bag, and a man took out 15t., you would say that man could not be indicted. Mr. BARLrnB would go that length. fr. Welhy appeared for the proSecultion, but was not called upon. The COuRT held that whatever diBliculty might exist as regarded the larger sum of 5,0001, there was no difficulty as to the smaller sum of 3001. The statute had intendedto give every facility for punishing persons guilty of improper conduct with respect to the receipt and disposal of money belonging to the Crown. It was clear, according to the prisoner's own statement, that he had the 3001., and had employed uart or the whole of it on speculations of his own. Mr. Baron MARTJ2S protested against decisions of judges years ago. and before this act was passed, being brought for the guidance of this Court. The act of Parliament should be read, and its intention ascertained, and then acted upn. As to the smaller sum there was no difficulty, nor di he tbink there was anyas to the larger sum. Conviction affirmed. TME QUEEN V. JOHN J-E5SOP. The Prisoner was convicted of amisdemeanourof receiving lOs. as benoty money for enroling himself in the Kent Artillery, and it was alleged against him that he had improperly answered the questions put to him under the Mutiny Acts. One question was whether he belonged to any other corps; and another was whether he had served in the army. The prisoner answered both in the negative, although he had before been enroDed in the Kent Militia. The prisoner was tried before the Ilecorder of Canterbury, and it was left for this Court to say whether he was rightfully convicted. The first point was whether the militia was the army. Wr. RussELL, for the prosecution, contended that he had obtained the money by a false representation, which came within the Matiny Acts. The CouxT decided that on the first count there was nothing to sustain it, and as to the other counts the Court had not sufficient stated in the case for them to affirm the conviction, which therefore must be quashed. Conviction quashed.
PREROGATIVE COURT. SATuIDAY. JAN. 26. DYCE SOMIBRE V. TROUP, SOLAROLI WTERVENING, AN'D rRINSEP,-A- VIE HON. EAST I.DIA COP.ANLY ALSO IVUERVEFNDG. (Befre Sir JOHN DoDsoN.1 Sir J. DoDsoN delivered judgment in this case, which was argaed last Trinity Term, and occupied the attention of the Court 19 days. The substance of the pleas was reported in 27ie ;2nes of May 31, and. the arguments of counsel on the 7th of Jinly. his was a question, he said, as to the validity of the will and codicil of Mr. David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, deceased, the vil bearing date the 25th of June, 1849, and the codicil on the 13th of August in tho same year. The deceased .a. .I ii, IoI- m ma ginge ln HJ-street,_ Berkeley-square, possessed of a very large amount of property. The will and codicil were propounded by Mr. I. T. Prinsep, one of the executors named therein, the other two esecutors-rnamely, the Hon. Moun-tnart Blphin. stone and Sir EL IL Elliott-not being parties thereto. Probate was opposed by the Hon. Mrs. Dyco Sombre, the widow of the deceased; by Ms. Troup, his lawful sister; and by the Baroness Solarolh, asserting herself to be his lawful sister, but whose interest had been denied by Wr. Priisep on the asserted groand of illegitimacy. She had, however, been admitted a contradictor to the will, and had appeared by her proctor and counsel. The East India Coropany had lik-ewise intervened, supporting the will and codicil, but they had not thought it necessary to offer any allegation in the cause. The will and codicil were in due form, having been respectively prepared by a solicitor, and executed by the deceased in the presence of no less thau three witnesses, all of whom were of the medical profession. The learned Judge then stated the substance of the will, and went on to say that the opposition to the testamentary paperswas founded upontheaver. ment that the deceased was of unsound mind when they were prepared and executed-that he was labouring, not under general insanity, but that form of it which lwas msully termed monomania. On the other hand, it was contended that the deceased was at all times of perfectly sound mind; that the supposed delusions under which he was said I to have laboured were not of an insane character, but were attributable solely to his Asiatic habits and manners, and to things prevailing in India; and that, even if he was of unsound mind at any time, yet he had entirely recovered previously to the execution of the will and codicil. The principles of law applicable to cases of this description were laid down in " Waringv. Waring decided bythe Judicial i Committee, and reported in 6, Moore, P. 0. cases. The judgpnent in that case was binding upon this Court, even if it entertained different opinions from thosethere expressed, which it did not. It was delivered by Lord Brougham, and was concurred in by all the other judges. The deceased, it appeared, had been born in Sirdhiana, sn the upper provinces of Bengal, in or about 1808, and had descended from ancestors some of whom were of European and others of Asiatic orign As to his exact pedigree the parties were not agreed, hut it was of no importance to detemine whether European or atsiatih blood prevailed in his veins. It was of more importance to consider by whomI he was brought up, wrhere he was educated, and with whom he assoiat e. From the evidence of Dr. Drever it appeared that the deceased was conversant to a considerable degree eith E uropean manners; that he had been educated by a clergyman of the church of England, who wa amarred man, and who had a family; that he afterwards associated with offcers and ladies who visited at the Begum Sombre's; and that he was in the habit of gein to military stations and visitig the officers. The deceased, therefore, was nut altogether ignorant of European manners, though born in India. Other wiitnesses gave a similar account, but there wras a difference of opinon among them with respect to his jealousy of women. In 18 6 her Eigh- - ness the Begam Sombre died, and in 1838 he arrived in England. In 0l& he was married to the daughter of Lord St. vmÂ¢centJ and they continued to cohabit together antil March, 1843, when he was put-under restaintat the Claren. don Hotel as ae lunstic, whence he was removed to Hanoverlodge. In September that year he was atowed to travel for his health, accompanied by Dr. Grant; he escaped from Liverpooland arrived in taris on the 22deort23diof that month. The charte was, that he cecame insane in 1842 and 1843, and thet it was necessary to put bin under restait. On the other hand, Mr. Prinsep saserted that he did not believe that he was at any time insane. If it was estabished that he was insane at that t ime, then the question would arise whether he had recovered from It previourly to the execution of the will? The onus pf-t bdimdi must in thefirst place lie upon the party setting up insanitwa; evetypetson must be presumed to be of sound mind unbil the contrary was shon h Ther testion ras whether mrDye Eombre had duly discharge that oenu; whetheryshehadnroved to the satisfaction of the Court that in1842 and 1843 he wassof usound mind. Sarah te, the lady's-maid of M Dtce Sombre, proved that he charged his wife with cominittsng adultery witE a great number of people, andamong themwith her own father. That was something more than Asiatic jelousy. He alleged that she had been guilty of that crime with waiters, shop- 1 men, and soldiers. On one occasion he asserted that r. Dyce Sombre's father had confessed to him that he had been gniltyoftheoffence. Thovalletof Mr. DroeSombretoacertain extent confired the lady's-m id. b The facts, howrever, did not rest on the evidence of servants cian hadbeen- exained by whom he had been attended, and by whose| athority he hadbeen put under restraint. Sir Jams Clarkce. deposed that one delusion under which he labonred whs, that his wmie had been guilty of adultery with her father in Hyde ParCnl in open day. Certainly that was insanity. Dr. Meonu> corroborated Sir James Clarke as to the insanity of the decmeased in 1843, anda dded that he entertained a belief that hc was vercy likely to -be poisonied-a very frequnent attendant upon diseases of this krind. Dr. MWartin said that be was aware of the delusions of- the deceased respecting his wife from communications which he had made to him persnlly when at Hanover-lodge. Dr. Conolly g;ve evidence to the same effeet. Although in 1843 the deceased might at times have conve.aed rationally,.yet it was quite clear that he was incapble of making a will, or doing any act Tequiring thought, ji 3nent, and reflection. An inquisition was held upon hinn June, 1843, and the jUty found that he had been of unsound mind from October, 1842. The insamty having undoabtedly been established in 1843, the onus probandi shifted, and it was ncsrythat the parties settinig up recovery from it shou sa t the Court that their averments were well foundedTe Tedeceased having escaped to Paris, he was f.llow4ed there by Ir Frzere, who took with bima keeper. On his arrival he applied to the French authorities, through the English Arbassador, for rMr. Dyce Soombre to be delivered up; but it appeared to them that that was not the Prope course topursue- that it was not in conformity with the`French law; aAit was therefore determiined that ab investigation shouldtake lae An inquisition was held under the direction of the PIrdfet of Paris, and was attended by two or three physicans nominated by the F'rench authoDrities for that purpse, Rsy in his work on medical jurispradence, pointed out theo mde Of examin tion adoted in France andinEngland. It was said, in "Waring iV. Olaring," that the exPlantiOns of parties themiselve, could not be received as sufficient if they had an object in vievw. The French physicians came to the coaclusion that IMr. Dyce Sombre was of sound mind, but it appeared that they had nothing before them to guide them but his state- ents and a letter from Sir James Clarke, The deceaed made a most extraordinary statement before those gntle Imen. He charged Sir James Clarke with sending another physician to give him medicine which upset his understanding, the effect of which lasted three days, during which he was brought before a court of intuiry and, as the result; was incarcerated. To suppose that ;ir James Clarke could be guilty of the conduct imputed to him was out of the queston. He was asked about dueli and stated, in reply, that there had been onle one chl%enge, and the matter was amicably aranged, whereas there had been severaL He spoke of a paper in which there were some e- traordinary representations as to the mode in which he was to be reconciled to his wife, which he had put into the hands of Sir James Clarke as a joke, but Sir James stated that he gave it to him v7 seriously. If the French phyi cians could have bad Sir James examied before them te would not have given credence to the statements of Mr. Dyce Sombre. rs. Dyce Sombre, who seemed to havebeen a ind wife, wvrot letters to him to see if she could do anything for his comfort, and he produced one of those to show that they were on good terms, but the last time he visited her he withdrew fromlher with a sort of abhorrence. It was an exceedingly imperfect examination. The evidence could not be put in competiticn with that taken shortly before in England, and it could not have the effact of showing that he had entirely recovered, much less that he had never laboured under any delusions whatever. That he still entertained the same opinmons with regard to his wife was manifest from the eviaence of witnesses as to his conduct when at Paris. He repeated his charges against her, and said that he was ready to leave the matter to be settled by the Jockey Club at Paris. Mr. Quintin Dick stated that he charged him, shortly after the examination, with beiga osirtr The Court could not but conceive 0 made a concealment of his insanity at the examination, having an object in view, and that he tenterained his delusions at the time. There was strong evidenco to show that he was insane in 1844. Inquisitions had been held in other countries. At his own request an examination took place at St. Petersburg, but there was no one there who could suggest anything as to his insanity. A similar proceeding took place at Brussels in 1845. He had entered mto a contract with Mr. Mahon to him 10,0001 provided he could obtain evidenge to enab reh to et pos,seson of bis income, and it wasin consequence of that that the examination took place at Brussels. At that, and at all the future examinations which had taken place by phy;siciras, except those conducted under the au- y of the Iord Chancellor, MIr. Xahon was a constant attendant upon them. The medical men at Brussels certified to his sanity, but one of the witnesses stated that the deceased said that he could have t a supersedcas to the commission of lunacy out against him and a divorce, if he would have bound himself to marry the daughter of Lord Ljdhaurst. In 1846 an examination took place at Dover by ?Vr. Bri*ht and Southey, under the ao-k thority of the Lord Chancellor, and it was clear from their evidence that he was then labouring under delusions. At an examination held at Brighton in 1847 he stated that he had got rid of his insane notions respecting his wife, but he distinctly admitted that it was since the examination at VDover. lie tried to show that he had lost his delusions, but be did it in such a way as to prove that the5ystr prevailed. He had at times sufficient cunning to parry off the questions pu to him. iTt was pressed upon him I b lI. ~alon and others that he must conceal his deluions or he had no chance of escape. Thatadvice was given particularly by Lord and Lady Combermere, who bad taken an active part inthe matter. He was to bepreopred to be crammed for the examinations. There bad been no less than six attempts to get the commission superseded, somne of which had been given uip. He was examined at mlivarts Hlotel in 1848, tinder the authority of the Lord Chancellor, and Sir James Clarke statedl that he t'hen fenced with the questions and impressed him with the belief that he was not less under delusion, although he exixbited more caution. He believed that he hadi been poisoned, and the four physicians who examined him came to the conclusion that bewasof unsound mind. His denials of his then belief in the infidelity of his wife resulted from what ho had been told to say. Having made charges of incestuous adultery, he offeredi no apology for them, but said the matter had better lhieleftiot helawYers. Afft, the examination his legal advisers did not think it right to bring on the petition for the ouperscleas. At a subsequent period an examinationtook place by Dr. Paris and several other physidans, who stated that in their o,pinion the deceased was sane; and undoubtedly anything coming from cdence of the Court. The aunl itiou to Dr. Paris was imade by Mr. lIbbon. Ir. Illahon was not to have the I10, 0001. unless the deceased succeeded in his object, but, although he failed, Wr. Mahon applied to be remunerated for work and labour done. The claim was referred to the aoitration of Mr. Prinsep anad Mr. Richardson, and they thought that he ought to be repaid the money he was out of pocket, and to iave some coniensation for what he had done. He was allow~ed, therefore, 4001. per annum. for the time he had been employed, that amount baving been paid to another person under the sanction of the Court of Chancery. That seemed to be an end of the agreement, but shortly afterwards it was renewed, and that gave rise to the last examnination. It was not until 1846 that the deceased took up the notion of the iegitianacy of the Baroness Solarol, and the only reference to it was in the edvidcnce of Mr. Crn"e, who stated that he beard it in conversation in India. It' apheared that the Begum always treated her as the lawful sister of Mrs. Troup, and the deceased, in a deed by which he conveyed some property to her, described her as his lawful sister. IHe stated that the fact of her illegitimacy was communicated to him by Sir Charles e3tealfe as a last favour before he left India, but when Sir Charles was applied to he said that he knew nothing abouit it. Mr. Dyce Sombre stated that, although Sir Charles would not give bhim a paper which would prove it, yet he gave it to Lord John Russell, and in a book- published bv him in 1849 he made an offer of 3,0001. to Lord fohn Russell if he would give it up; It was mere imagination, a delusion in the mind of the deceased, and prevailed when he underwent the last examination. It was unnecessary to refer to the evidence as to the deceased being received in good swciety in Paris-that was quite consi6stut with mronomania. Dr. Paris and the other physicianspresent did not know the extent of the delusions under which he laboured. Their evidence was not sufficient to overthrow the testimony given by witnesses in 18S8, who were acquainted with the natutre of his insanity, who lnew what his pre ng delusions were, and who exaimined him apart from 3r. lahon. Dr. Sigmond, one of the attesting witnesses to the codicil, was of opinion that he was of sound mind at that paticular time, but said- that -he Inew nothing about otherperiods. Dr. Olliffe and the other physicianswho attested the testamentary paprs also deposed to their belief that he was then of sound mind, but esaid that he had laboued under delusions as to ison being put into brandy; that he had heard that the Lord CnceUor had put him into possession of his property, which induce him to attest the will. A person mtght mane his prope exceedingly well to a ceOrtan extent, and yetb aorn under insane delusions, and any insane delusion whatever* operating on his mind would, according to the law and practice of the Court, render him incapable of makin a wilL But, supposing those gentlemen thought him capale in June and lm August, l1849, what wastobe said asto the publication of the book by the deceased cald the Refuiatio?, which took place very shortly afterards, and which must have been in preparation WMhen the il and codicil were executed? It contained satements which ,showedthat the deceased could not have been of sound mind when he composed it. Under thesecircusitances, the Court could come to no other conclusion than that he laboured under insane delusions in 1843, and that he continued to entertain them when tho papers peopoundod were executed, and when he distnbuted the eJ2ctetio. He had | published a memoir very disparagin to Baron Solaroli who, it appeared, was a gentleman oW very high 4arcter. The Court must pronounce against the ill d codiciL. 'With respect to costs, he must confess that he l-ad had very considerable difficulty, but he thoughtv 'he should not discharge his duty with the 1inmness which he ought to do unless he condemned the parties pro. oundig the apes in the costs. It migh perh&ps, have been the duty of the East India Company -to have an investigation to see whether the will was th1e act of a capable testator or not, because it tended much to the benefit of persons ling in their jurisdiction and it mightbpraiseorthyontheirprso to do: butthey had tuougmT proper to make common cause with the execntor propounding the papers, and therefore the Court could not well distinguishonefromtheother. Theyhad come, if ho understood it rightly, to a mutual agreement> and probly the case would not have been carried to so great a length if there had not been that understandingf between the parties. He was bound, therefore, to condemn the executor, and also the East India Company, inthe costs of the other two partes.

WoR.sEp.-sTR.-James Slade, a private in the City Militia, was charged with the following brutal outrage:- Sarah Foleqy, a modest-looking girl of 17, and who gave her evidence in a tone of great exhanstion, stated,-1 ive with my mother, a shoebinder, in White-street, Bethnal. green, and, in company of my younger brother, was oa riday night taking my elder brother his supper, when, just as I reached near the Staidard Theatre, the prsoner, whom I had never seen before, camne up, stared me in th face, and then assailed me in the most gross and indeoent manner. I called him a vagabond and hastened away, bru he foUowed and struck me, knocked me down, and Ideed me violently in the stomach as I lay on the pavement. My, brother tried to pullhiim away, bit could not, and while trying to get at my brother he dragged me along by the hair ofiMylead; Idon'tknowwhatthentook place, us I lost mysenses, and on recovering them found myself ia the police-station. From there I wastaken home,' have been in great pain all night, and am inmreat pai still. Margaret Foley.-When my daugrter csme home last night I 'was in bed and asleep. She did not wake me till she was abed herself, when I heard her cry out ina painfl rmanner, and on asklng her what was the matter, she told meshe as in great agony, and stated to me what she has now statea to the Court She complains of great pain in the groin, screams whenever she coughs, her colour iliuhes, her head burns very much, her hair comes out when I touch it, and I was obliged to apply lotions to her stomach al night. She lost a shawl oT mine she was carrying, worth 15s. ; she is an excellent girl, who, I am sure, would neither allow nor give cause for hberties, and works hard, and is a goreat comfort to mne.

In defence the prisoner, whoheard the evidence with .lt air of perfect indifference, merely said, " Mfyface is a3l orver scratches which she did " and Mtr.

The female prisoncr Vhite took up a handfudlof iser!eit.voonandStrew it on the fire, which was extremelyfierce at 'the timbe. A deserate scuffle then ensued on the prisoners attempting to destroy the apparatus, and they nearly overpowered the offlicers. However, they succeeded in getting them irto a. corner, when witness seized a complete galvanc battery, full charged, and a counterfeit fourpenny piece in the aet ot being coated with silver. The plaster of Paris mould was so hot he could hardly hold it, and a counterfeit ou=ezi piece and a halferown had just been cast in it, as pieces kthsF metal adhered toit.

Their late complements were ('20 and 750 respectiwly. Mr. Watts, chief assistant to the Surveyo of the Navy, h75a been down in the north among the' shipbuilders, to see 'how many gunboats and mortar-vesscls they can construct between this time and the advance of the fleet for the next campaignin the spring, and contracts have been entered into with fimzs at Newcastle, Liverpool, and elsewhere; so it may b expeeted that a large flotilla of these important iadjuncts to ourfleet will be readyfor service by the time the Baltic shall become navigable. The Foyle screw steam transport, No. 167, Captain Wrdight, arrived at Portsmouth yesterday from the East; she left Malta oin the 13th, and Gibraltar on the 19th inst.

The Nelsons has provisions for the dep6ts of' Malta. The Bullfrog, 2, gunboat, arrived at Portsmouth on Saturday morning from the eastward; and the Hecla steam sloop, 6, Commander Aplin, left Spit-head the same afternoon, for Pembroke. The Deva transport, Nfo. 96, went into Portsmouth harbour on Saturday afternoon, to be paid off The ganboats which have completed fitting out at Portsmouth are to assemble at the Motherbank. A Conrt-martia1 assembled on Friday at Portsmouth on board the Victory, to try Mr. Henry Thornton, actdig assistant engineerof the fleet (first class), serving on board Her jajesWs sloop Falcon, on a charge of neglect of duty, in consequence of -which the port boiler of the said vessel was burnt and otherwise damaged, the casing of the boiler set on fire, nd the safety of the ship thereby endangered, she being at the time under sail and steam. The Court found that the charge had been fully proved, and adjudged the prisoner to be dismissed from Her Majesty's ship Falcon, to be reduced to the rank of an assistant-engineer of the third class, and to be debarred from promotion for one year. The following ships are inx harbour, at Spithead, and in dock and basins, fitting out or refitting at Portsmouth:- I8 gunboats and several mortar-vessels, besides flag, gannery, training, and depHt ships, magazines, receiving-ships, yachts, tenders, tugs, and other craft. Captain H. J. Codrinaton. C.B., is appointed additional captain of Her Majests ship Victory, for particular service (gunboat flotilla, the captains and craft forming which will assemble at Portsmouth). The sloop Ferret, 8, Commander Charles T. Leckie, from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Plymouth on Saturdav ct:aluf . 2heleft;ierra Leoneon the Ist of January, sin days after the mail-packet Ethiope, Commander Barnwell. The screw steamship Conqueror, 100, Captain Ihomas C. Symonds, completed coaling at Devonport on Friday. The screw steamshipNile, 91, Captain George IL Mundy, having had her engines and boilers completed at Devonport, got steam up on Saturday, and will go into the basin-dock at Keyham on 'Wednesday. The crew of the London, 90, Captain Augustfus L. Kuper, 'were paid off on Saturday. She will this day be warped to the jetty at Devonport to refit.

The hired screw steamship Indian, No. 197, wiith troops, arrived at Plymouth on Saturday, and is appointed to leave to-day with the depOt of the 58th for Dublin. The steamship Great Britain, having been again taken up by Govermment, is being refitted and repaired, to be made available for the conveyance of troops. She will sail from Liverpool on the 9th of February, with about 1,100 troops for Malta. The screw steamer Sarah Sands is also being refitted at Liverpool for the transport service. The Bucephalus, having discharged her cargo, is to bh paid olut of the transport service. The various trophies which composed her cargo at present occupy a considerable space in the Dial-square in the Arsenal grounds at Woolwich. The guns and small mortars, which latter consist chiefly of cohorns and royals of 6 inches and 3l inches, as well as many field pieces and howitzers, and a number of heavy guns, corresponding with our 68-pounders, are aU of very valuable brass metal; but, with their present bore, they are not serviceable for our description of shot. It is conjectured therefore that :hey wil be re-cast. The officers and men forming the field train corpswho were at the siege of Sebastopol, are anxious to wear some particular markto distinguishthemfor their services there. They propose for that purpose the melting down one of the large guns, to be converted into small crosses, or other medals, to be distributed solely for the decoration of that corps of Her Majest's service thus engaged. The carriages and waggons are of small intrlnsic value, most of them being shattered and utterly useless. Awheel of one of the ammunition waggons is covered with Russian blood, having been fourd embedded among the bodies of several dead soldiers, which were lying with the carcasses of dead horses, &8c. Major Lukin and the men Who came in charge of these trophies have completed their work of mounting tlle guns and placing every article in a conspicuous position, as Her Majesty has signified her intention of giving them a personal inspection. Major lukin waited on Lord Paumure on Saturday to inform him -that everything was prepared for Her Majesty's visit, which iSaraised to take place on WVednesday next. The Admiralty. yacht Black Eagle, astes-Commander Petleg, havingcompleted her repairs, went out of Woolwich basin on SaturdLay, and has commenced coaling. The Radamanthus likewise left Woolwich basin with machinery, boilers, and 17 fathoms of chain cable for the use of Her MajesWs ship BRdiea at Sheerness. Tle paddlewheel steamer Spitfire entered the inner basin at Wooheich on &saurday to be overhauled ana to make good her damages, wlich are considerable. At Bristol Messrs. C. Hill a Sons are making the greatest exertionis to complete the three steam gunboats u. ilding by them as. uclly as possible.

THE STUDY Off WJIFILALAW n OXFORD.* - Thle Unitersitv of Oxford mtay be said to be at o,reseut in a fr5nsition state. It has put off its old Irocaedepettieoab and ha5 not a5 yet be6n fitte", with one of a more modern cut. An-U ve sity in its s t'ma seem a very ImPflpper expression, and yet his term perhaps CP,nvCys more adily than anyi other the esistir d condition of ;Alma2Mater. 'hcreweasthis b-"efiat leastabou9 the old system, which P" de the Faculty of Arts the reality5 and r.iuced all oter faiculties to a shadow,-that it was intelligible; you: knew where you wver-. yotu knew what a degree meant. L 'FrWoWs a " irst," and gaveamanacertain stamp for 1ff1J; but now we are threateneda'with so many differe:.at kinds of examinations in honours in5 so maNv different schools, that all honour will be ultaaately frittered avay, and no great test of VJniversity distinction will remain. JVe SuPPOpOS that something like; order and regalaxity will at last emerge from what is 'now the abQdie of chaos on the banks of the Isis, but neEuing can be more unsatisfactory than thework;iqg eE the new system in many respects. There is tkat venerable faculty, for example, Civi Law, of wk-lch the common law of England has been so jealous that it has always followed the advice of Lord(okoe, and given Justinian and his int;itutes and P in&cts a&Wry cold shoulder. In Oxford this fanlty has niwiays ocen mnIamect m a state or spleuitaL ]cmury, as a scantily-endowed Regius ProEessorship, khough even under this discouraging state of things the study of Civil Law in Oxford has produced such names as Sir Leoline Jemkhis and 1b3rd Stowell. 341. 1Ss. a-year, granted by King Hlenry VIII. or King Edward VL, and a Lay prebendal stall in the cathedral church of Canterbury,. added to the professorship in the year 1617 by King James L, and recently commuted for 1001. a- year, now constitute, with small occasional fees, the whole income of the fortunate Professor, who is expected to devote his life to instrtzting the University of Oxford in the whole Corpus Juris Cirilis. Thiswas what the professorship had dwindled to under the old system; when the new Hebdomadal Council set to work to remodel the faculty of Civil Law, it was at once seen that if any work was to be got out of the Professor of Civil Law he nmst be better paid, or be allowed to be assisted by deputy. After varioius sugwestions the plan proposed to the University Commissioners by several distinguished members of the University seemed likely to be adopted. It was to come to the assistance of the Regius Professor by appointing under him assistant-professors or lecturers, who should take the rough work of the faculty off his hands, and leave him free to lecture on the great principles and science of Civil Law. A decree to this effect was proposed to Congregation Last Michaelmas Term. It contemplated the establishment of two Readerships in Civil and Common Law, and it would have been a great step towards reform in Iaw studies at Oxford. To the surprise of all but those who are acquainted with the working and constitution of the new University system, this decree was lost on a point of form in a very thin Hlouse, and the University is again at sea on the question of law studies. We now hear that a measure is about to be proposed to Congregation in a few days by which it is proposed to require that the Regius Professor of Civil Law shall devote himself dwuing six months of the year to the service of the University, those six months being the busiest portion of the whole year; and that an addition be made out of the lUniversity chest, by which the whole emoluments derivable froni the professorship will stand at 3001. a-year, this being the exact sum which it was proposed to give to the Readerships which were rejected last term. We must confess that we have read this liberal proposal with astonishment. As times go, we should think that even in Oxdord it might be known how little 3001. a-year wil do towards supporting a Professor who fills en officio some of the most dignified positions in the University. Has the University never heard of such a thing as cheap law? Well, then, let it beware of starving its Professors down to tlhe condition of Romeo's apothecary. If they want a man to teach law properly, let them pay him proportionately to the duties w;hich tlrey expect him to performu. We have been led to these observations by the perusal of a letter addlrssed to the Vice-Chancellor of the University by the Regius Professor of Civil Iw, wvho very orcibly e.xposes tere imataes committed by the University in this respect, and vindicates the dignity of the venerable faculty which at is now proposed to degrade. The following extract will show the small persol interest which the learned Professor has in the question at issue:- *" I may, perhaps, be expected to makc some apology for entering on the discussion of measures in which, as you well know, I have no personal interest. My tenure of the chair of Civil Law is but temporary. I occupy the gap between the old and the new systems, and when the scheme of academic legislation, as it regards the Professor of Civil Law, is fully completed, it wviU bo my duty, as it will also be my pleasure, to place the chair once more at the free disposal of the Crown. Bt twhile I hold the professorship I have duties to fulfil to the University, to the chair, and to the profession of civilian; and I hold that I should have been guilty of a dereEction of my duty to them all, if I had been silent muder the circumstances. " Connected as I am professionally with the practice of the Civil Law, and called upon by my duty, as VicarGeneral of the Archbishop, to ascertain the fitness of candidates for admission to the courts in Doctors'commons, I feel a warm interest in the revival of the study of the Civil Law in our IUniversities, -which is quite independent of the duty under 'which I am officially bound to advocate it. I do not, however, consider myself called upon to record any vote in the Congregation of the 29th. The approval or disapproval of the proposed statute must rest with those who cannot be supposed to have anypersonal interest in the question, but I have no hesitation to avow that, if I were present, I should feel it my duty to say, 'Hanc rogationc7n Acacecinici, robis antiquccndam censco."' * A Letter to the Vice-Chzanceltor of the Unirersity of OxJord on the Lazo Studies of the Unisiersily.

THE RuoErmy PoIsoxwrG CASES.-At an early hour on. Friday morning the body of Mtr. John Parsons Cook, on the charge of marderin,gwhom.WilliamPahner was first committed for trial, was exhumed, and taken to the Old Church, atRugeley, in orderthatDr. MoncktonandDr.Harland,physicians, and Ar. Bamford, surgeon, might examine certain portions of the corpse, vhich were not on the occasion of the firstpost vzltenz examination subjected to that minute investigation which it is now thon"ht desirable that they should undergo, and consequently did not pass under the chymical anaysis of Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees, at Guy's Hospital. With as little delay as possible the medical gentlemen named were ready to commence their mnpleasant task. Before, however, they conmmenced to operate upon the body, Mr. George Palmer, solcitor, of Rugeley, a brother of William Palmer, who mow awaits his trial in Stafford Gaol, not only on the charge of poisoning the unhappy man Cook, but aLso his deceased -wife and brother, gave notice to Inspector Crisp, who had the superintendence of the exhumation, and in whose charge the body was understood to be, that it was his mntenhtuon to secure, duringthe post mortem investigationthen about to commence, the presence of a medical gentleman from Birmingham, wvho might at the same time have an opportunity of examiuing the body in the interests of his imprisoned brother., Hr. Gardner, the solicitor for the prosecution, 'was also presint, and with Dr. Monckton, Dr. Hlarlaiid, and Xr. Bamford. made such arrangements as would enable Mr. George Pabner to carry out his intentions, and secure at the re-examination of the body the attendance ef a medical man whose object would be the making of such aninspectionas-wouldtend tothe benefit of the accused. The body was left in the old church in charge of the lic until the post w0ortem e-xamination shonld be completed.

There are some truthful observations inthe Bamner -of Ulster -with respect to the efforts now being made in various quarters for the development of Irish resources. The Encumbered Estates Aet has been, as it were, the pioneer of this new state of affairs by removmg some of 'the most formiidable obstacles to the introduction of new capital, skill, and spirit into the va'ious departments of agriculture; and a hope has sprtng up that the Legislature, encouraged by the marked success of this measure, will, whenever peace is firmly re-established, drown the last howl of agitation by some fair adjustment of the relations between landlord and tenant. "The treasures of our island," says the Belfast Jo'trzael,- "Are not confined to the surface. Many of the most valuable minerals areTfound beneath it, and already, coal, iron, copper, and lead are successfol3yworked to an extent which at least serves to show how much remains to be achieved by capital and enterprise more largely and judiciously apulied. The coalfields now partially worked are seven in number. Three of these are in our own provinee of Ulster, and, though as yet they have not proved of much economical value, we possess strong presumptive proof, not only that they occupy a much larger area than has hitherto been inagined, but that other fields, in still more important ocalities, are not discovered merely because they have not been explored. The geological indications which have of late been so frequently referred to are dest,ined, we trust, ere long, to pas from therather dreamy region which they now occupy into that of reality, and thus acquire a better titlo than they yet possesss to the name of important discoveries. he SOand odd thousands oftonsofcoalandcalm,ifornaingthe total estimated'output' of 1854, oughtnottoberegardedinany other light than as the first fraits of an abundant harvest which will yet be reaped. ILon ore, as almost invariably ha ppens, doubtless by a benevolent arsangement of Prov-idence, accomipanies the coaL It also occurs in other localities in sufficient quantities to furnish, under proper auspices, the materials of a great branch of national industry. As yet, however, scarcely anything has been done to turn it to account. Of copper ore we are able to speak in more gratifying termrs. It is now actually worked in five different counties and 15 different localities, and during the last five years has been regularly and even rapidly increasing in amount. In 1850, the quantity of Irish copper ores smelted at Swansea was 10,021 tons, and the value, 69,594L.- in 1554. the quantity was 11,739 tons, and the ,vafue 120,/3531. Lead also moakes an important figure in our list of mineral prodce. It is worked in six counties, and in 1854 amounted to 2,210 tons 15 cw t. Nearly the half of this quantity was procured from the mines at Newtownards. From the ore were obtained, in additionto the lead, 18,096 ounces of silver, which at 5s. per ouncevield 4,5241. Among more recent accessions to our mineral riches it would be unpardonable to forget the salt mine of Carrickfergus, the actlal annual produce of which cannot be less than 15,000 tons. But in order to form a properidea of the resources of Ireland we must quit the solid land, and, after making a survey of its rivers and lakes, bays and long vithdrawing creeks, hoist our sail, launch out into the deep, and make ourselves familiar with the tenants of its adjacent seas. In nothing, perhaps, is tle unaccutultelu ,aY1:Iay ALv i+.I, ever7thlig Irish has been too long regarded more conspicuous than In the neglect of our fisheries, in which, under any degree of prudent management, not only might valuable retums be at all times secured, but the horrors of our years of famine might have been greatly assuaged, if not altogether averted. The herring fisherv on the east coast of Ireland is prosecuted chiefly by 200 or 900 vessels from Cornwall, who carry their fish to the Dablin and Liverpool markets, while the fishing vessels of Deblin and its adjacent ports content t,hemselves with the humbler office of becoming purchasers and carriers to these men of CornwalL Such is the statement; and, though it is almost impossible to read it without blushing, its accuracy cannot be impugned. The Irish markets are still extensively supplied with cured fish from Scotland and the Isle of Man. In 1S53, 95,339, and, in 1654, 121,884 barrels of herrings were imported into Ireland. Why should it be so? For no better reason that can be imagined than that Providence bestows its bounty on our countrymen, and they, through sluzgishness or some worse feeling, allow others to reap all the advantage." rSERVATIVE SOcrETY OF IER XND. An association under the above style and title, established about twvo years ago, but not since heard of, suddenly reappeared before the public last week, a mneeting of its mwembers having been held at a house in U:pper Sackville-street, the MIarquis of :Dowvnahire in the chair.

The Bctfast aUere-nap repudiates the notion of societies for electioneering purposes, and remarks: "The Tenant Leage is now at an end. Of no existing Reform or Liberal club have we any knowledge, but we bear of a Conservative club in Sackville-street, Dublin, and of its intention to bring in members here and there. We cannot too early say to the Ulster constituency-' Get rid of all such dictation, you are commpetent to think for yourselves, to support your own Protestantism, to promote your ow n political opinions; in fact, ycu are quite able to judge for yourselves[ l Such clbs are generally supported bywhat is called the landed interest, which may not Ratays be in accord with the manufacturing and commercial population of this great province; and emphaticallyowe nown say- sResist such dictation anddenounce club nominations."'

The whole e g the programme was devoted to compositions by Mozart, tbs 100ti anniversary of whose birth it was intended t-, .co;inemora'te. True, Mozart was born on the 27th Of JTiry (17d-,at Silzbhu); but as the 27th feU o Sunday, and as orn Sundays tho Crystal Palace iP not only closed to ,nutcal performances but to tho public, the day previous (the Us. day) was appointed for the celebration. " Celebmtion" is perhaps too big a 1.iord to apply to a concert of such humble rpretensions.5-s concert at which scarcely a single player or singerof 5tc assisted-but the intention was good; .and that the att-action was genuine required only a glande at the crowdeo- appeI..a-ce qf the music-room to certify. The muisforxune wko tlhat -o large a number of visitors c6uld not obtain adonittance (nearly 1,200, we were informed), the haxmn;cda. sdoon in the noith wing being limikdii ints caacity of occo1amodation, while the central tra'sept of the vast and gliering monument is inevitably antagonistic to mnsical effect, unless on occasions when (as at the inauguration) enormous masses of vocal and instrnniental performers are engaged. -AI over Germany (of course), and in rnany of the provincial towns of Great Britain, the centenary anniversary of the birth of the most gited and universal of composers has found some recognition in the shape of a musical performance, exclusively of his works, ranging from a grand festival down to a comparatively unpretending concert. In London, however, nothing of the kind of any consequence has been announced. 3l. Jullien-who would doubtless have seized the opportunity with the same energy he exhibited (in 1848) on the first anniversary of the death of Mendelssohn, which laid the foundation of the so-termed "festivals"'is absent on his country tour. Our Sacred Harmonic Societies, our Philharmonic Societies, our Amateur Societies, and, what is most surprising, 31r. Hullah at St. brtin's-hall, havc allowed the occasion to pass in silence. The 100th anniversary of the birth of Handel was worthily commemorated by a series of performances on a gigantie scale in Westminster Abbey, but that of Mozart, as great, if not a greater composer, has been overlooked. It was left for the Cryst Palace Company, with its verylimited musical means,. to vindicate us from an utter wvant of respect tovwards the memory of so prodigious a genius; and from this point of view it behoves us to regard the concert of Saturday afternoon, not merely -with lenity, but with indulgence. The following was the programme;- Overture-" Idomeneo." Dnet-" Dovescorre. Miss Grace Alleyne and 3iss Palmer. Sonata. Pianoforte and Violin. in B flat. Mrr. W. H. Adamns and Mr. 3Manns. Song-"Batti, battL" 3Miss Aleyne. Violoncello Obligato, Mrr. W. F. Reed. Hianoforte Sonata i P. Mr. George RusselL Song-l o ti lascoY MslsPalmer.

Scena and" rl-' AbI questo seno." Miss Palmer. Andante and Finale, from the Symphony in F, flat. If we were to say that jnstice was done to the more important features of the above selection-such as the overture to Idomenco, and the movements from the B flat symphony-we should be steering wide of the truth. The band, under the direction of Herr August Manns (successor to Herr Schallehn, with whom he has no little in common), does not admit of it. The attempt, however, was praiseworthy, and encourages us in the hope of better things to come. If music, as an art, is considered of sufficient im;portance to be represented at the Crystal Palace, the conviction may, some fature day, he entertained that it should figure with as much dignity as any other branch of knowledge and acquirement. There can be no logical reason why one alone among the arts (assumiing for music so distinguished an honour) should invariably, and as a matter of admitted routine, be looked at superficially, and paraded in such a manner as only to conciliate the mostvlgr and ephemeral tastes. This Mozart concert, with all its drawbacks of execution, is, therefore, a step in the right direction. To criticize the performances in detail wouid be superfluous. We may mention, however, that Miss Afleyne, who seemed to be an especial favourite, was encored in "Batti batti ;" and that the most remarkable display of talent was that of Dr. Wylde's very clever and promising pupil, Master John Barnett (nephew of the composer of the Aozzntain Sylpb, Fair Bosa022nd, and Farindui), who has earnedso well-merited a celebrityat the concerts of the New Philharmonic Society. The grandest movement in the grandest of Mozart's pianoforte concertos was played by the young gentleman in a manner that called for unqualified approvaL There was no reason, indeed, why the entire work should not have been presented, since the audience were just the opposite oftired, or enauyi, at the end of the alle.gro, which was thus unkindly separated from its companion movements. The audiencewere much pleased with the concert, which they were enabled to appreciate and enjoy all the better through the aid of a printed programnme, interspersed with a geatrmanynotes, explanatory andhistorical evidentlyfrom tne pen o a practised and well-informed writer. In conclusion, we trust tihat this concert may not be the last by many of the same hInd, and that every effort may be made to render the musical department of the Crystal Palace worthy of being classified with its other multifarious attractions.
THE FATAL POISONINGA AT S'GA. We announced by telegraphic despatch fromAherdeen, on Friday, the death of two Roman Catholic clergymen and a landed proprieor at DiwAll, on Tuesday, by poison. The details of this most distressing and appalling case are these:-On Tnesday evening Provost hlIver had a party of friends to dinner, consisting of the Rev. James Goraon, Roman Catholic priesb at Beanly; Rev. Angus 2'Kenzie, Roman Catholic priest at Estdate; Mr. awis3 MKezie, proprietor of the estate of Eindon Black Isle; Mr. John 3Donald, of Torriden; ProvostMIver, and thenaembers of his family. After dinner lr. Gordon complained of a parched mouth, took a drink of water, and retired from the room. Mr. 2'PDonald also felt il, complaining of a parched and burning sensation in the month and throat, took a drink of water and went out intothe open air, walldin about smartly to drive off the affection. Mr. 3PKenmie, the other criest, was then taken ill; next Mr. MlKenzie, of Findon, an Provost 3IIver, the symptoms being the same in aUl cases. Dr. Smith was immediately sent for, and was speedilyin at.tendance,butbeforehearrivedthetwo clergymenwere vomitingand suffering dreadfully, and every attemnpttoreieve their agonywasvwithout effect. Theybothdi, andMr.]MKenzie, of Fmdon, sanknext. The Provost, feeling assured that they had alltaken some deadly poison, kept moving about -with energy, and this, with the medicne he received, had the effect of enabling, him to overcome the attack. Mr. 3Donald, in like manner, kept walk;ing about wsith energy, and being naturlly of a strong constitution mastered the disease. )XTone of the other members'of the party felt ill, and everything was done thas could be done to save life. Besides Dr. Smith, Dim Willizams and Dr. Ross were present and most assiduous in their attentions. Without loss of time official inquiry was made into the cause of the poisoning. A request was sent to Edinburgh to the Lord Advocate to send down a competent person to conduct an inquiry on behalf of the Cronm, but long before he "arrived the true cause was ascertained. It appears that in the garden there wvas a well-known plant, called miohkes-hood, or wolf. bane. (Aconit unm-apdWas), a peremnial much nsed for adorning gardens in Scotland. Near -to it there was some horse-radish. The stork of the nonr's-hood being dead, the root was ecadly of the same formn, size, and colour as good horseradish. 'The cook having sent the man servaut to the garden for radish, lhe had dug id a root of the monlis-hood bv mistake, and used it for garnishing and sauce to the roast beef. Thiscontainedthepoison. lipartsofthoplantare acrid, but especially the root. The Provost, carving, ate but sparigly, and vas the last to be seriously affected. Tle Jadies, it is said, partook of the mutton only. The gentlemen, who. were supplied with the roast beef, were taken ill one after another in the order in which they had received it, but at fdrt and for some time the idea or pOiSOn, it seems, did not sug6gest itself. ' In 1S42 alady died in ILambeth from the effects of this poison, taken in precisely the same way as on the present melancholy occasion, In 1836 a family were poisoned mn the City-road, london, in the same manner, and several othler cases have occurred of the same fatal character. It was at frst reported the root of the hemlock plant had been used by mistake, but-the henmloch, though a poison, is not so deadlyas the wolfbane. The caseis a warning tobe carefilinthe ase of herbaceous plants of this character in gardens, and indeed of any plant of the kindwhere there -is the least chance of its being used with food. * The melancholy occurrence has cast a deep gloom over the whole of the north of Scotland, where the deceased were well known. Mr. PKenzie, especially, was looked up to as a most promising landlord, and the two priests were nuch respected and beloved by their people in the uiorth. The bodies aroe to be dissected,hbit as we have no coroner's inquest in Scotland there will be ano publiec inquiry.
