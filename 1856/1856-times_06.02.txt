PICTURE GALLERY AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE. Withorit a gallery of modern pictures the palace which professes toillustrate thehistory of art in its most important phases would manifestly have been incomplete. When it was first opened with all its spendours and novelties one could not help contrasting it with the original structure in Hyde Park, in which the life and industry of the 19th century were displayed in full activity. The building and all it contained, with the trees growing under/ its transparent roof, and an occasional sparrow flitting to and fro, seemed part and parcel of the present hour. | In the same building at Sydenham, on the contrary, one found at firat all the dead and forgotten arts resuscitated, or, at least, gloriously embalmed in a gloriouis mausoleun. The directors of this 2nagnaiicent musenm, however, in cultivating tle dead arts and languages, have not overlooked the living, and gradually all that can illustrate modern discovery and contrivance is being wrought into the general plan. Fountains without and music within-the last new letandthelastnewsong; ftesandflowershows, a hothouseand an aviary; newsrooms and dining-ronms; the peace trophy of to-day, and the Scutari monument that will last, we trust, for ages; these, together with the exhibited results of industrial art, evince the desire of the directors to make this grand building illustrate the present as well as enshrine the past. And now, having already formed one of the finest collections of statuary in the world-in plaster the very finest-they turn their attention to the sister art, and in the north wing of the palace have prepared a picture gallery which will be open to the public to-day. Some of the arrangements are still incomplete, but from the private view of Saturdaywe augarwell for the prosperity of the scheme, and this in the full consciousness of the difficulties which attend it. It is right that these diificulties should be distinctly recognized both for the success of the directorate and for I the satisfaction of exhibitors. It is easy enough to exhibit sculpture in the Crystal Palace. It is easy to muEtiply copies of a statue, and it is easy to place the statne in an excellent light. Far better for an artist to exhibit a piece of sculpture at Sydenham than in the gloomy dungeon in which the Royal Academy confines, like ghosts in Hades, the choicest works of our modern sculptors, academicians though they be. But it is not possible to multiply pictures in this way; and, even were it possible to multiply them, there is still to be encountered the great terror of artists-the hanging. We all know the jealousies that arise out of that delhcate operation, and how society after society has been formed to redress the grievances of painters whose works are hung out of sight. With regard to this point, it is entirely a question of confidence in the officials of the company, and we have little doubt that for their own sakes they will do their best. They have an ample gallery, too, so well lighted from above that it would be somewhat diflicult to place even a small picture entirely out of sight. We do not anticipate much objection on this score. The real difficulty is how to get the pictures, most of our successful artists being more or less exclusive in their tastes; and as they can easily sell their works-sell them while still on the easel-they may at first be inclined to regard this gallery as the refuge of unsold pictures. It is proper to state this suspicion quite frankly, and also to add our belef that, when the collection is completed, it will prove to be unfounded. A great number of the pictures, indeed, are to be borrowed from private collections, and some of our best artists have promised to contribute to the gallery. Reserving a more detailed notice for a fautue occasion, we may in the meantime state very generally the plan of the exhibition. The gallery is divided into a suite of rooms which are allotted-one to English artists, another to Geman, a thi-d to Frenc!i, another to Belgian, and so onit being the intention to represent all the European schools more or less perfectly. The idea is excellent, and, interesting as a picture gallery is in itself, it is never more so than when its arrangements enable us to compare our own progress in art withthat of ourneighbours. Itisbycomparison that we learn to discriminate; when we have the works of one school eterually before us we admire without discrihiinat. ing, and by bringing opposite styles into proximity, as in the Crystal Palace, more is done in a single visit to educate our population in artthan would be accomplished in a dozen visits to a gallery devoted to one school only. Most of us can catch up facts; very few can classify these facts; and by this mode of exhibiting pictures in classes that is done for the miMion which they cannot do for themselves. It is always the most pleasant way of look. ing at paintings, and, with their large opportunities, the directors might in future years carry out this system of classification still further-now exhibiting the -works of one master in chronological sequence, now illustrating in a rapid way the history of landscape painting, now bringing the different styles of portraiture into comparison, and, in a word, doing for the pictorial art -what they have already done with so much success in the Itahan, Egyptian, Saracenic, and Assyrian Courts for architectural decoration. The best display is in the rooms allotted to continental art. Many of the best English pictures-among others, one by David Roberts, have not yet arrived. There are. indeed, a " Sancho Panza" of Leslie's; a capital portrait of Charles Kean as Louis XL, by Phihlips; a landscape, with foreground of ferns, by Antony; one of Frost's sea nymphs; some calves, by Horlar; and some works by Pickersgill, Hering, olt, and others. Bat, on the wvhole, the English part of the exhibition seems to be the most backward. Of the German school the principal work is a landscape -with figures by old Lessing, which is, indeed, a Arst-rate specimen of the style. Every detail here is admirable, the light of the fire, the stonework of the ruins, the action of the figures; but best of all are the keeping and harmony of the wholethe figures not being lost in the landscape, and the landscape not being a mere background to the figures. Jordan exhibits a wedding scene that is full of life; Len a landscape of water and mountains, the former remarkable forits transparency; Gude andWebersendsome noteworthy landscapes; while the fruit of Preye and the cabinet picture of Tidemand, in -which peasants appear around a fire, are also well worth looking into. Of the Begian school, Pieron sends two landscapes. both interesting to the English visitor, although there are very few foreign landscapes which he can look at with perfect satisfaction. We like to see the sun in pictures, and cannot understand why continental artists refuse to paint sunshine. We like sbadows, but cannot understand why a picture should be all shadow. On the other hand, the animals of the. continental artists are in some respects superior to those painted by English hands. The Belgian and French artists are not afraid of painting them in action; they prefer to paint them in action. Thus we have the cattle fighting of Verboek. hoven, and in the French room the oxen of Rosa Bouheur, the horses of Montpezan, which are almost alw-ays good in intention, if sometimes faulty in drawing. The horses painted by Dreux, with a long avenue behind,' is a bold attempt at perspective and foreshortening which few of our artists would even think of. If the attempt is not quite successful, the motive is at least praiseworthy. In the same spirit Sebron contributes a view of New York in snow, the horses dashing down the street at a quick trot. Courbet sends some of his remarkable pictures; Couturier has some excellent poultry; and Biard has a picture of Gulliver at Brobdignag, which, as usual with him, is better in conception than in execution. We must not forget, however, among the Belgian pictures an architectural scene by Henry Leys, in which the tone is very fine; an old woman and bay, by De Bloob; and a couple of donkeys, by Stevens. Even in these departments, how. ever, more works are still to arrive. The Eing of the Belgians is to send a work of DeKeyzers; the "Judgment of Solomon" by Baron Wappers is also expected, together with two studies by Ingres, and some flowers by St. Jea. It is even hoped that the. Meissonier -which the French Emperor presented to Ber Majesty may also be procured. When the gallery is completed we have little doubt that it will be one of the principal attractions of the palace.
DEiID ATE MIUDER.- PLYMOUTH, Sunday -By Electric Telegraph.-The ship Rmunymede, Captain Burrows, now at anchor in the Sound, bound -with 248 male convicts for Swan River, was this afternoon, at 3 o'clock, the scene of a deliberate murder, committed by the second mili officer in comnmand, Corporal WDiliam levan, upon his annior, Acting.SergeantMajor Bingham Robinson, cboth Elonging to the local pensioners, of whom there are 30 in all on board. Robinson, who was on the poop, sent for Nevan and ordered him to fetch private Snllivan for parade. While Sullivan was submitting his irelock for examination Nevan descended to the main deck and puta cap on his loaded firelock; he then went part of the way up the larboard poop ladder, and, stoopin, fired at the sergeant, who was standing on the starboard side of the poop. The shot broke the stock of Sullivan's firelock-in two pieces as he held it in his hands, lmokned off two of Robinson's fingers and then entered his abdomen. Robinson, in faling, cried out " Oh God! I am shot; Oh God! I am dead," and in a few minutes e.ired. It appears that recently, when on duty together at the artmoor prisons, PRobinson and Ncvan did not agree, and that the latter, when in charge of the police, said that Robinson hdthreatened tohave his pension ta!;en from him. The sergeant leaves a widow and four children, and the corporal has a wife and five children.

AMEZCA1AFFAIISa TO THE EDITOP OF THE TDNiES. Sir,-Amsricau politics andpoliticians are but very little understood in this hemisphere,-tbey cannot be judged by European ideas and standards America aill not submit the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to arbitration,-of that you may feel assured. The Central American question is resolving itself; the country will beoccupied by an American population, 'which will flow intO itby thousands, now that there is a nucleus formed by Walker around which they can rally. It was easto foresee that as soon as this fact could be established the Cabinet of Washington 'would at once anirnowledge the Government de facto of Nicaragua, and late advices from America inform us that Padre Vigil has been formally and kindly received by President Pierce as the. accredited 3Iinister from the Fil1ibuster Government. The possession of California by the United States, anc the immense weekly trafEc across the isthmius, in merchandise, and in passengers by thousands, render the possesseoa of the country a matter of vital importance to the Amelicans, and they will acquire it in spite of all obstacles; the recent massacre of passengers at Panamawill "bat hasten-. the natural and inevitable course of events in that quarter. This feeling of "manifest destiny " is in the very bones. and marrow of the people, and only awaits the course of events to be openly avowed. They feel that the territorymust fall to them,-the pear is ripe, the country must and: will be theirs; therefore they will not submit the interpretation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to arbitration. As forthe enlistment question, that has been only a con- - venient peg on which to hang a dispute for ulterior object and such a peg -will always be found by American politician= whenever Engiand may appear to them to have her hands full in Europe, as at the period when the present '- difficul- ties" were broached, -when peace appeared to be at an inde- - finite distance. As the English and Americans are virtually one people,and as each nation profits and prospers by the extension o£ its population, its language, its commerce, and its civiliza-- tion under one or the other form of government, it scarcely matters which, al territorial jealousies between them should. cease. The Fillibusters are but the pioneers of a better civilization, and of an enterpri'ing and energetic population, which will absorb the inert races of men in those fine regions of the earth, which they but nominally and sparsely occupy. Of 'what value to the commerce and civilization o£the world 'were those splendid countries Texas and Call-- fornia until Americans at once, and as by the enchanter's wand, developed their hidden riches 9 Are not these countries now opened as freely to English ente7prise as Canas&, Australia, or New Zealand, and cannot Americans acquire the same rights and privileges in England's colonies as the natives of Britan? This is the " practical" view to take of Armerican affairs,this is the way to cut the Gordian knot of diplo-- macy; for, after all the "notes," this is the natural result to which events will assuredly drift, for nothingcan arrest the overflowing of the Anglo-Saxon population into every corner of the North American continent, andthen-why, then they will cast a glance southward, to thelandsivhich wilithen join on to theirs, where there is roorm for countless millions of "brothers andcousins," with " the spirit of liberty in their hearts and the. language of Shal;peare and Mlton on their tongues."

| TTBSTAM77TARY JTUlISDICTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIYM E5. Sir,-You were kidn enough to insert in your paper of the 27th a letter from me, on which there yesterdayappeared some observations from "A Country Solicitor,'3 agreeing with my statement of the serious evils of the present sys,tem, but urging that the Solicitor-General's bill is; not so complete a remedy as another bill, -with the same general object, also before Parliament, framed by Sir F. Kelly. I consider that either of these bils passed into a law would be a great boon, but the main object would be more. fully accomplished by the Solicitor-General's bill, which3, however, might be improved from Sir F. Kelly's. The Solicitor-Generals bill certainly provides one court. of probate for England; of which your correspondent, "A i Country Solicitor," complains; but it permits executors to do in the country all that is needful for proving. It also provides (which Sir F. Kelly's does notl that rag. lish probates sball be good for Ireland and Scotland. This is surely most reasonable; and let Irish and Scotch probatesbe good for England. Even sinceI wrote you I have been instructed to prove in Ireland a will lately proved in the Prerogative Court in England. The effects in Ireland are under 3001., and 'the additional expense will no doubt be more than 5 per cent. on the Irish property. This is an addition to the seven or eight instances which I sent you before. lVhile discussing different measures and reconciling op-- posing interests, the Legislature may, it is to be feared, le,the session pass by and do nothing ; and numberlesm wilU3 will still require to be repeatedly proved, at great and most mnecessary expense. A wil may be proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, again at York, again in Ireland, and again in Scot. land, to say nothing of the many Royal peculiars. If a complete measure cannot be passed, it would be :; great thing to have an act even for this purpose onlythat a pro'oat or administration from any existing court of probate shall be good for the united kingdom; anmE that this law shall apply to existing probates and admiais..- trations as weUas to future ones. The full stamp duties of: course to be paid. This Practical object would not be unworthy of your powerful advocacy. I am, Sir. youlr obedient servant. A SOIJCTrOR. M Alay 39.
IRISH Srdrrs.-In 1855, 6,228,856 gallons of proof spirits were entered for home consmnption in Ire. and, against 8,440,734 gallons in 1S5,and S,136,362 in1853. There were, in 1855, 2,214 detections of offences against tho E:cise lass, 597 prosecutions, and 464 convictions, the result of which was the imniuring in gao]s of 246 persons.

The bill of 3,r. Patten, however, has inopportunely interfered with the progress of the fencmg, and has par.alyzed theproceedings of many. The inspector - advise the Government that the bill, as it stands, will not only be inoperative for preventing accidents from millgearing, but injurious in other respects. Theyeamestly request that the least possible amount of discretionaTypower maybeleftintheirhands Tho reports for the half-year show an increase of 79 accidents, under circumstances which leave little doubt that they would have been pre- - vented had either of the fencing precautions recommendedby Sir G. Grey and his predecessor been adopted. The accidents from machinery. were 1862 -9G0 to males, and 902 to females; 449 to young males, and 462 to young females; and 209 to male and female children. The accidents not arisng from machinery were 98. There were 202 informations laid, and the result was 141 convictions. Pending the debates on the subject in the House of Gcmrnmons, it may.. worth while to state, on the authority of Sir J. }i;aid, the inspector of the Scotch distnct, that the educational condition of the poorer children in Scotland is lamentable, and in no wise improved since bh last wrote. The social evilbe regards as enormous. THE PUBi,c ID1Ta ACT.-A bill has beelt brought in by the Government to amend the Public Health Act of 1848 by extending its provisions. It repeals the proviso liniting the duration of the General Board of Health which is authorized to inspect districts and to report to Parliament the result of all Its inquiries. Provision is alsb made for the adoption of Public Efealth Acts bytown-coun. Cis, the constitution of local boards of health, and the powers to be conferred on them. FORETG?'

MONEy-MA RKE TET' ad CITYINTELLIGENCE. Saturday Evening. Notwithstanding the singularly favourable character of the Bank returns the English finds have again been heavy to-day, many sales having been effected under the apprehension that even the most earnest wislhes of the Cabinet and, the people to avoid a confict with America may possibly prove vain against the apparent determination of the Government at Washington. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 945- to 2, were first quoted at 94lk to lD whence they receded to 94g. From this there was scarcely any reaction, and the last prices were 94Q to A for money, and 93 to 4, or 93M to a ex. dividend, for the 10th of July. The scrip of the New Loan is 11 premium. Bank Stock was quoted 21 to 217-x; Reduced, 934 to -; New Three per Cents., 93Z to 94; Annuities, 17,f; India Stoclk, 233 to 235; India bonds, 2s. discount to 2s. premiium; Exchequerbonds, 931 to 99; and Exchequer-bills (March), 2s. to 5s. premium; Juno, Is. discount to Is. premimun. The foreign securitics were rather heavy to-day, mnd the transactions continue limited. Turkish Six per Cents. -were negotiated at 99A for money, and 994 and -J for the account. The Four per Cents. guaranteed for the account were dealf in at 1034. The general operations comprised-Granada Deferred, 73 ; Mlexican for account, 23 and 22g; Portuguese Four per Cents., ex. all overdue coupOnS, 46- ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 'Stl; Sardiniani Five per Cents. for the account, 94; Spanish Three per Cents., 47; the New Deferred, 25i; Passive, 7; Spanish Certificates, 61 per cent. ; and Peruvian Dollar Bonds, 5GL The final quotations of the Frenchl Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 74f. 90c. for money and 74f. 95c. for the accoiut, showing a recovery of an eighth per cent. The advices from Paris received this afternoon state that great excitement prevailed oni the Bourse yesterday in consequence of the failure of M. Place, one of the directors of the Cridit Mohilier, with engagements to the extent of 1S,000,OOOf., or 7,20,0001. sterling. The recent runmotrs of an intendled Russian loan of 15,000,0001. are discredited. It is stated that B3aron Stiegiitz, the St. Petersburg Court banker, left Berlin on the very day on wlhiclh it was alleged the French, Dutch, and other capitalists had been summoned to meet him there. With regard to a rrench loan the Paris letters are still silent. From thc quantity of gold knowvn to have been taken to the Bank during the present week the next retiu-n is expected to be almost equally favourable with tbat just issued. Although in some instances the Continental exchanges have exhibited during the last day or two a less satisfactoiy tendency, they are all of them at a point to preclude anv gold being sent away unless under exceptional circumstances. It is possible, however, that special demLands may still h.ave had to be met for the East or elsewvhere. The letters froml the Continent express anxiety regarding the elfcet of the weather on the crops. The continmued floods in France threaten damage to the wheat, and from Milan a considerable rise in silk is reported to-day by teleg'raph, also in consequenice of prolongeed rain. Subjoiied is a table of the fluctuations in the ntock and share market during the month just ended. The range of prices has been considerable, the extreme difference in Consols having been 2- per cent. The rise established is 2 per cent., and wvould probably have been much greater but for the extraordinarv announcement of the intended recogluitioni by the Uniited States of the piratical gov-ernment established by their own citizens in Nicar:,gaua. In railwnay shares there has, on the average, been a proportionate improvement, but the advance has been much greater in some descriptions than in others - FL=C.rTroxs m rTE; STOCK AYD SuHARE 3fMAErS DURING THE MO-NTH OF MAY :- The raurway meetings of the week have presented some facts of interest. A further adjourmnent of the proceedings in connexion with the election of the directors of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Company has taken place. The shareholders of the MIidland Railway have agreed to raise 400,0001. in new shares, to provide vorks for the increased traffic. A favourable opinion is still expressed with regard to the Leicester and Hitchen line. The dividend of the Leecds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction Company is at the rate of G per cent. per annum. It is stated that the Gilderstone coal branch wili be very shortly opened. At the WVaterford and Kilkenny meeting the report was adopted. The receipts are gradually increasing, but the revenue will not at present allow the declaration of a dividend. The distributioni of the Cork, Blackrock, and Passage Csmpany is at the rate of 5s. per share free from income-tax, leaving a small balance to be carried forward. The several Xills before Parliament promoted by the Great DNorth of Scotland PRailway have been agreed to. Accocding to the report of the Belfast and Ballym2ena Company, the dividend will be at the rate of a7. 7s. Gd. per share. Progress has been made with the Cookstown Extension line, which will shortly be available for general traffic. At the Shrewsbury and Herefordmeetinc the bills for raising new capital . nd for constrLcting jointly with. other companies a station at Shrewsbury were approved. The report of the Monmoutbshire Company has been carried, including a dividend at the rate of 30s. per share on each of the 1001. shares, and of 7s. Gd. per share on each of the 251. shares. The shareholdeis of the East Suffolk Railway have sanctioned the bills for constructing lines from. Lowestoft to Beccles and from Great Yarmouth to Haddiscoe. The Royal Swedish Company have given notice that, in pursnance of resolutions confinued at Gottenburg, they are prepared to issue the 7 per cent. preference shares to the holders of the original shares. Subjoined are the railway calls for the month of Juine, so far as they have yet been advertised:- mLne Iollowing letter has been forwarded to 'ns from-Oepenhagen for insertion:- " Sir,--It is with considerable surprise that by your city article of Tuesday, May 6th, people here have learnt that the] Danish Government is on the London Exchange accused of neglect in paying ' the guaranteed interest on the Zealand Railwzy, due on the 1st inst.' As in the article <quoted you wish yourself for an explanation, I beg leave to state that, in conformity with the Danish law of the 27th of February, 1852, sec- 5, 'the guarantee of the Danish Government is to cosmmence when the railway in its whole jengthhalj have been opened to the conveyance of persons ;ss wel as goods,' and that from that time the Danish Govermnent has bound itself to guarantee an interest of 4 percent. of the capital invested.

These. together with the six directors appointed by the Great WVestein Company, will constitute the new board to manage the affdirs of the company. SOUTH YORKSHlRE. On Saturday, Lieutenant-Colonel Yo!land, R.E., inspected the new branch line of tlsis company from Doncaster to Thorne. The branch line is a single one, about 10 miles in length, and has been open for some moniths past for mineral traffic. It is constnicted almnost entirely on land belonzing to the company, and nins on the banks of their river and canal. Telegraphic comnmunication is about to be esta.blished along the line, which, in conjunction sith the South Yorlslhire, extends from the South York coal-field into the heart of a rich agricultural district. WEST SOMERSET 2INER AL. The act of Parliamnent for this line was obtained in the last session, and the works were coimmenced on Thursday last, Mr. Brown, of the Ebbw-vale Iron Company, having turned the first sod. The railway is to commence on the pier, in the harbour of Watchet, ini the Bristol Channel, and extend to the Brendon-hills, where valuable iron-mines are now worked, its principal object being the conveyance of the iron ores for the Welch ironoworks. The length of the line is 131 miles, and the cost of the works is estimated by Mr. Rice H^opkins, the engiueer, at less thana 4,0001. per mile. A contract has been taken at prices undar the estnuate. LIERRE AN1D TUR-NUOU.7T. The report of the directors of this company states that the line was opened for traffic on the 2:3d of April, 1855, but the guarantee of the miniimum interest did not commence until the 23d of May follovwing. The completion of the Lierre station has been deferred urntil a decision be come to in respect of tlle concession for a line from Coutich to Lierre. The cost of the railvay, )39 kilo-netres in length, now nearly completed, will be 173,G000., including working stock, being at the rate of 4,440l. per kilometre, or 7,0001. per mile. The proposed new lines from Turnhout to Tilbourg, Bois-le-duc, Utrecht, and Aimsterdam, and from Herentha]s to Macseyck or Vento, and from lIerenthals to Louvain, will contribute to devceope the traffic on the line. If these proposed lines are carrie4 out the Tarnhout line will form part of the great trunk line fromn Paris to Amsterdam, ri4 Charleroi and Louvain. The receipts realised from the 23d of May to the 31st of December last amoiuted to 5,3S4l., and have been more than sufficient to meet all work-ing expenses. The line was worked by the Antwerp and Rotterdam Company, and the rent, &c., due by the latter up to the 31st of December last amounted to 4,728., out of which is deducted 2527. forthe reserve fund, leaving an available sum of 4,4771. From this sum is deducted 4,44S3. for dividend, being equivalent to 10s. 4d. per share, leaving a balance of 341. 5ih FORTH A,ND CLYDE -JUINCTION. This line was opened for passenger traffic on Wednesday from Stirling to Ballochs. It is expected that the fine scenery en the line will induce a large number of passengers to travel over it during the summer months. IKILLAPRNEY JTUNCTION. The half-yearly report submitted to the shareholders on Saturday stated that the commercial traffic is increasinlg considerably. On the completion of the line to Tralee, it is expected that the receipts of the company will largely increase. Upon the half-yearly account ending the 31st day of October, there was a balance to the credit of revenue, afterthepayment of dividend, of 2,280?., which added to the net profit upon the past half-year makes 4,3501., out of wz hich the directors propose to pay a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 1,820?., to the credit of the next account.

VICTOP?IA PARK. TO THE EDITOP, OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The letter of your correspondent " Indignans," and the circumstances which he describes, are calculated to give a very unfavourable impression of the crowd who assembled in Victoria Park on Thursday. I hope that some one better able than myself to do them justice will have appeared to vindicate their character, by giving the brighter side of the picture; bnt if not, perhaps you will allow me a corner ius your valuable paper. I was in the park from 8 o'clock till the close of the display of fireworks at half-past 11, and during the whole time I was in the centre of the crowd within a short distance of the barrier. There was the most perfect order throughout; and this was not disturbed when a shower of fire accompanied with the fall of some heavy rocket cases obliged us for our own security to retire to a greater distance. I am sure that nowlhere could your own two admirable rules have been better obser-ved, " Don't push," " Don't run." I left the park in the midst of a closely-packed column which had to make its exit across a narrow bridge and throegh a gatew.ayleadinginto Old Ford. There, at least, I was prepared for a severe crush, and for its usual accomp3ni. ment of noise. There was nothing of the kind. I may simply nention that my next neighbour in the crowd had an infantin his arms, who remained quietly asleep during the wholoeiime employed in crossing the bridge. I aamsureitat tise people whom I saw in the Victoria Park might gire a lesson to many whom it is the fashion to call their " betters," in consideration for others, and in gentlemanly beasrzg.

STATE OF TRADE. MANICEESTEB, MkY 31. The market rLas exceedingly flat and depressed'at the commencement of the week, sellers having to make a further concession in price to effeet sales. Cloths of all kindsdomestics, T-cloths, longeloths, printers?, shirtings, and ,aconnots-gave way, and yarns were quoted Id. per lb. oower. The announcement of the reduction of 1 per cent. in discounts by the Bank of England, however, which took people a good deal by surprise, has had the effect of giving more confidence to manufacturers and sellers generally since Thursday, and yesterday and this morning they report that they could have done a good business at the terms of Tuesday, but are holding back for better rates. A good deal of the flatness observable in the early part of the week was owing to the state of the Liverpool cotton-market. After the receipt of news that cotton had been received at the ports of the United States to the extent of 869,910bales, in excess Of what had comne to hand at the same time lastyear, being400,000 bales more, thus early, than the entire crop of 1S35. Since Thursday. however, notwithstanding these advices, theLtverpool ruarket has been firmer, and this change has helped to strengthen the improved tone of our own muarkret. Of the linen trade int Manchester Messrs. Rielardson, Tee, .nd Co. report:-" The demand for linens continues good, although less IS beig done for the home trade than during last month; stocks of both goods and yarns are extremely light, while many makers are yet engaged to order; the late reduction in the rates of discount and the tendency towards lowerprices for food wilt favonrably infinence demand for manuthctured goods, and, as arrangements for the autumn tradel will,shortly have to be made, we think present rates forlinensof mnostsorts hlkely tobe maintainedalthouigh lower prices have been expected by the majority of buyers since peace was established, its effect on the import of flax is not yet ascertained, but, shouldthat article be sent forward early and in large quantities fromr Russia, a reaction may occur int the value of the Scotch makes, in which it ismainlykused, especially as those hinds are relatively high compared with the Irish and Yorkishire sorts." BIRIINGH.UM, MAY 3L There has been little change in the iron trade of South Staffordshire during the present week. The leading firms are -well employed upon old contracts, but new orders, especially from N'orth America, are scarce. Eixpectations with regard to that trade have hitherto not been fulfilled. Some of the large makers of inferior iron are short of orders, and, as usual under such circumstances, lowerrates are submxitted to rather than stop the operations of their wvorks. The manufacturers of best descriptions continue, however, to maintain the trade prices adopted in Januarv, and, with the present orders in hand, they will doubtless do so during the current quarter. It is a general opinion that when prices are high, as they at present are, as compared with some previous periods, the Sonth Staffordshire ironmasters are subjected to great competition wvith the Amnerican and continental makers; and such is the case at the present moment. The charges for raw materialscontinue, however, so muchl above their former level that the makcers of best brands, unless they reduce theprice of labour, cannot afford to produce best qualities under existing trade quotations. The stock-s of pigs throughout the district do not increase, and there is httle alteration in prices. Speculation appears to be at an end, and purchases now made are all for immediate consumption. There is therefore no danger of a return of that disastrons revulsioni which happened after the speculation which occurred in South Staffordshire and Scotland three or four years ago, and the consequences of which in some quarters are felt to this day. Native stone remains both scarce and dear, and the Ulverstone continues to be brought into the district in large quantities. We are promised, however, an additional supply of firstrate quality froml the insuiediata neig,hbourhood. It is stated that Ir. Benuett and Mr. Dawes, two gentlemen extensively engaged in the iron trade, have taken unon lease from Lord Dartmouth a large tract of land, known as Friar-park, between Sandwell and Wednesbury, and immediately contiguous to the South Staffordshire TUne of railway. This property is said to abonnd with minerals, both stone and iron, and likely to prove a source of great and much-needed supply to the neighbouring furnaces. Lord Dartmouth, like Lord Ward, appears inclied to turn to accoumt family inheritances hitherto occupied and used for agricultural purposes only, and by these means add greatly to the minini and manufacturing interest of the districts on which their estates are situated. The coal trade, considering the season of the year, is active and production gratly on the increase. W e mentioned a few wreeks ago that the Cannock Chase collieries were producingaconsiderable quantity per week more than they did twelveouoths ago. Since then still larger quantities have been drawn from these new and valuable mines. The owners are now in a position to ra ise 1,000 tons per diem. This large accession of supply will lead necessarily to a reduction of prices of the b&st qualities of coals used for house purposes, and wiM at the same time to some extent set at liberty at reduced rates inferior qualities required for the iron furnaces of the neighbourhood. The opening of the Cannock Railway, now in course of construction, will afford great facilities for the conveyance of this coal to all parts of the kingdom. The work is being pushed forward with great vigour. The orders received in Birminghamn during the week-have been upon the whole encouragging, and sanction the favourable returns of the Board of lrade with respect to the increase in our export trade. If for the last month there was a considerable excess over the corresponding month of the last year, it is pretty certain that the next returns wil exhibit a still further increase. In every article and branch of Birmingham manufacture the returns just published show progressive improvement. In hardware the increase in value exported was 55,33CL.; in macninery, 17,0.5S.; in iron, 440,0u0L; steel, 1S,G691. * copper, 67.074Z.; tin mawrought, 4,426l.; and tin plate, 48,272Z. From Australia and the West Indies the advices of our merchants now to hand hold out hopes of a reviving trade, and the orders received are taken as forerunners of still larger ones. Purchasers from Melbourne, who vithin thesefewdays have been in Birmingham, state that stocks of hardware in the Australian markets are becoming low, and that the demand for husbandry and edged tools of all descriptions is very brisk. The continental trade already exhibits advantages derived from a return of peace. Considerable orders are in hand for Prnssia and the German States, which, in consequence of the restrictions imposed by the Privy Council upon exports, it would bave been impossible to execute with safety and security during the continuance of the war. The Meediterranean trade is also reviving, and were appearances more pacific than at present in the Italian States there is little doubt that the exports of Birmingham manufactures suited to the markets of that peninsula wouldbe larger than they have been for some years past. Houses largely engaged in that trade intimate that business would be unusually active but for the present uneasy and threatening position of the Rooman States. A gradual improvement continues to be perceptible in the condition of the various manufactures of the town. T-he ironfoundries generally are pretty well off for orders ; and, vhat is considered somewhat unusutal at this period of the year, the grate and fender businesses are, at least in several establishments, very brisk. The tin ware manufacture, which for a short time vwas somewhat languid, has made another start, and one house is compelled to put a portion of their operatives upon overwork. It will be recollected thai at the time tin wares to an immense amount were required for the army in the Crimea the Birmingham manufacturers, m consequence of the lowness of the offers made by London firms, failed to obtain most, if not all, the Government contracts. They have, consequently, in no way suffered by the suspension of military and naval requirements, and have been carrying on a steady business in the home and colonial markets. The steel-pen manufacture is active, the demand both for the continent and North America being very large and continuously increasing. Several of our brass-founder during the present week have received a large accession oi orders, and even in cabinet brass foundry there is a marked improvement. Generally the businesshas been slack durini the winter and spring, but we hear that several of om largest establishments are very full of orders, and that the demands of ironmongers and braziers throughout the country are heavier and more numerous than at the commencenient of the vear. Prices, although high, are apparently now settled for some time to come, and purchases will be made with greater freedom than when the rates of copper and their probable firmness or decline were mattenr of sp)eculation. Theactivity of our heavy rolling mills speaks well for copper manufactures generally. The coppes tubing and iron piping businesses still continue remarkably brisk, At Dudley the chief foundries are w-elliemployed, and the nail makers are apparently better off for orders than a few weeks ago. The festivities of the week-but more especially the f6tes on the Castle-hill in celebration of the Peace- have, however, considerably imnpeded busines operations in some of the workshops in which orders were urgent. At Stourbridge the chain manufacture continues busy, and tho make of boilers in the neighbourhood of Brierley-hill and the adjacent districts, if not increasing, is steady, with a prospect of improvement. The saddlers' ironmongery business at Walsall is good, the demand being, if we except a small amount of mi]itary work in hand, for the sa ply of home requirements. The Coventry riband weavers and watchmakers, so far as we can learn from parties connected as Birmingham merchants with the latter business more especially,make few complaints. The demand for watches for exportation to the Australian colonies slightly increases; but it vill be some time before the glut of these articles in Melbourne houses has passed away. There is no material change reported in the trades eitherof Kidderminster or Redditch. The needlemakers of the latter town are in the enjoyment of considerable prosperity, while the carpet weavers of the former are said to be doing something more than an average amonnt of business. The common lockmakers of Darlaston and Willenball are not so busy as a short time back, but for best patent house and chest loclks there is a great demand both in Birmingham and in Wolverhampton. There has been little or no fallin-off in the make of gun-loCks. The affairs of Mr. Green, of the late Lichfield Bank, were, in the shape of a dividend rmceting, before the Birmingham District Court of Bankruptcy to-dav. The filed proceedings showed that at the first meeting debts were proved to the amount of 112,9371. 11s. SAd, atthe second, 20,3321. 3s.6Ld; atthe third, 19,4801. ls. IlOd-; at the fourth, 12,1561.1&s.3d.; and at the fifth (to-day), about 12,0001., making an aggregate of 16,0861. 16s. 3d A dividend of 2s. Gd. in the pound, payable in a few days, -was declared, and sanguine hopes are entertained,in consequence of the good prices which the properties sold have hitherto brouhit, that the estate will ultimately yield lOs. in the pound; a good dividend it mus' be, but not so large as at first anticipated. The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce have had under consideration during the week the new Joint-Stock Companies bill, with the view of obtaining some amendments in the proposed measure; but, as the hill passed through committee b)efore these amendmnents were forwarded to fr. Spooner for introduction, it is questionable wh ether the obh jects of the Chamber witi be effected. NOTTLNGHAM, MAY 3L The weather has very sensibly affected the fancy laca trade this week, combined with the peace rejoicings in London, and the result is that a much smaller extent of busiress has been done than in any p;eceding week for some time past, Plain nets continue freely in request. American buyers, lIaving selected very moderate supplies, are now holding off, apparently for the purpose of cheapening the goods; but the low state of stocks will prevent any material' depreciation of prices. We have, on the contrary, to report rather an improvedt demand for hosiery for the home supply. Although the orders are very small, they are general, and indicate a very low state of stocks in the wholesale warehouses and in tbe hands of retailers also. The American trade is g-duor slacking onf, so that although our market is fully sustained, business is somewhat quiet. The further reduction in the' rate of discounts has given firmness to the prices of goods,, and manufacturers will not sell except at increased rates. Cotton spinners show signs of yielding a little to the reasonable demands of the manufacturers, and we hear of some-' concessions having been made in the prices of yarns- butfor some time to come it is not at all likely they will a,pproximate to those of January last. Wool maintains its fi-mness; and silks have a slightly upward tendency. LEICESTEII, ILty 3L There has this week been a tolerable amount of businessdone in gloves for the market of the United States. In the. regular w orstedand woollen branches of hosiery the tradehas been, and, indeed, continues very flat. The kntbranch. is exceedingly dull, and in this department thle high price of' raw materiel is more particuhu-ly felt. Fancy hoisery forthe ALmerican markXet is indemand, and this and the g,love trade for the same market have kept those departments brisk. On the whole the operatives are as well, if net. better employed than they have been for some time. I -wools there is not much doing, the result of the new clip. beinganxiouslyaawaited. There is not much demand forworsted, and prices have not altered this week. Purchases. are restricted to the immediaterequirements of the manufacturers. LEEDS, MAY 31L As was anticipated in the report sent last Saturday, the, fall in the price of indigo has been followed byacorresponding reduction in the charges for dyeing. Wool-dyeing has just been lowered ls. per stone on all true colours. Thi will be some advantage to the woolen cloth manufacturers, who have not unreasonably complained of the difficulty of realizing fair, living profits, with the continued rising cost. of both wools and dyeirg. As to wools, both for the woollen and the worsted trades, the upward tendency which prices had had for several weeks has received a check. At the sales of colonial wools. in London this week the attendance of buyers, foreign aswell as English, has been less than in the preceding week, and altogether prices have been a shade lower, and the salesless animated. It is questionable whether the advance ob-tained at the opening of these sales has not been lost, andL there appears a prospect that the present range of prices isnot likely to be soon exceeded; for the supples arenor augmenting in greater force than wvaslately antipated. The amount of wool imported into London inthe week ending the 29th inst. was 12,734 bales, and into Hul 947 bales. The local brokers have not done much business during theweek, but they are daily receiving the lots they have purchased at the current sales in the metropolis. After thesesales are closed the clothiers will operate with more confidence, and no doubt the wool now in the hands of the brokers wiMl soon be in those of the manufacturers, whohave little stock of the raw materiaL Vely little of the newclip of English wool has yet come into the market; for, in point of fact, the coldness of the weather is retarding sheepshearing. Only a few of the spring wool markets in the agricultural districts of this county have yet commenced. The following is the report of the York wool-market on. Thursday last - "To-day was nominay the third market for the new-- clip, but in reality it was the first market for any practical purpose, little or no business having been transacted on the two p receding market days. At this marlket there was .- fair,but notto say a large show of wool, and a good many persons were in attendance, particularly farmers, whose. object appeared to be for the most part to ascertain hows pnices were likely to runrather than conclude sales. At. present the wol dealers manifest little anxiety to become purchasers, but there were sufficient sales effected to enableus to give something like a quotation of prices. The finest clips appeared to be worth from 15d. to 1GL per lb., while inferilor sorts ranged downwards belowr that figure, according7 to their respective quality." The attendance of buyers in the cloth-halls to-day has been rather below than above an average, and they madetheir purchases but sparingly. Indeed, the prices aeked and. the pnces offered do not meet very readily. Probably the differences between buyers aiid seUers -will be easier settled. when more confidence is felt as to the supply and the cost of wool. There is a quiet, but cheerful tone in the market, and the lowering of the Bank discount, which must be followe& bythat of provincial establishments, ald other signs of " peace and plenty," afford good grounds for expecting a- continuance of at least the pre.'ent amount of prosperity in the woollen trade. The goods most saleable just now are for the fall trade- double-milled cloths, fur beavers, velvet witneys, reversible cloths, e.a The worsted trade, both at Bradford and Halifax, has. been rather quiet since this day week. Wools are rather easier, but not much has been done in them. TheBoard of Trade returns, published in T77c Tinmes a. few days ago, show that the general trade of the country isin a very satisfactory condition. The exrports have rapidly Iincreased since the peace treaty was agreed toD. The folloxving extractfrom thetables of exported articles in the month of April in 1854, 1855, and 1856 is interesting:- 1854. 1855. 1538.

This having been, to a great extent, an idle week, there. 'was not much doing in the w.ay of business,; et what hasbeen done shows that if people had had more leisure, and. the early days of the week had been fine, there would have. been more animation in trade than prevailed for some time past. Prices of provisions still range enormously high, and_ will continue to act for some time, it is to be apprehended, as a check upon activity in commercial quarters; but therapidlv increasing cheapness of money will, on the other hand, afford facilities and encouragement for operations in, business,, now that war is no longer a bar to legitimate enterprise. In Smithfield, on Thursday, there was a fair share ofbusiness transacted at firm, though not higher, rates. It isto be hoped that the good effects of the late rain will soon, be experienced by the public in their dealings with this and othermarkets, particularly that for butter, which article has been extremely high for saome time past. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday inclusivewere 22,743!. against 19,1SGI. last week. The followvin- is an abstract of duties received at the partof Dublin for tte week ended 24th of May, 1856:- Tea, 7,4261. 16s. Gd; refined sugar, G991. Ss. 3d. * luscovado sugar, 2,8441.

There was not a great deal of business transacted on the Stock-Exchango this week. Shares in general were firmu, and sought with more eagerness than for a long time past. Among the particular instances of improvement, we notice mining shares, which advanced lbs., and Cork and Bandon, 11. Singularly enough the funds declined 7s. d. oil the very day that the Rank of England low ered the rate of discountto 5 per cent. BELFAST, 3ULn S30. Linen.-The linen manufacture has had a very satiisfWtory season so far, aud bleached goods hold on steadily at full rates. The demand for the home market camnot yet be reported as active, nor vill it be so until the great stialalant of manufactures, cheap food, gives greater power to the masses. While, however, the demand for linen goods in this country does not come up to -what it was in 18&52 and the followingyear, the home trade is much above the average of the last two years, and is rapidly improving. The. bleaching establishments are in full activity, and the rintivorkishave had a very stirring four months' trade. Brownmarkets were well attended all last week. _Arnagh. and Tandragee exhibited largely the peculiar styles of goods made in these districts. The damask trade is well supported ; demand has kept close to supply, and the scale of' wages is favourable to operatives. First-class hands are able to earn excellent wages. In the shirt front trade a. steady business has been done for the American market, and the lawn and handkerchief departments continue very active. Ballymena market on Saturday was satisfactory, so far as regards theamount of sales effected. Buyers tookill stock at full rates, and in some cases firmer figures ruled sales. Yarns continue to show firmness. The rates for top quaEty warps are improved, and spinners have refused orders. at the recent scale of prices. Some rantes of weftsa fluctuate slightly, but not so as to givo an effect to average. values. Flax-The conntry markets held during the past week have had avery small supply of flax, all the farmers beinonow nearly cleared out of whatever stocks they were bolding over in expectation of higher p-ices. The reduction whlich has taken place in Riga flax makes that article bettervalue to spinners than our native flax. In Cootehill, Ballihay, Armagh, and listhfriland not more than 30 tons appeared, which sold at thefollowing prices:-Hand-scutched, from 5s. Gd. to 7a. 6d.; milled, 7s. to l0s. Gd. per stone of 1641b. Cotton.-In finished goods the prospects are at present. more satisfactory than they have teen since the commencement of April, and, as it is fully expected that -we shall have stm cheaper cash before the second week-in June, and muchi cheaper corn in July than we have at present, manufacturers look forward to a very steady business in the later, summer and autumn months. The amount of production kept up by the handloom weavers in the several localities. around Belfast is, perhaps, above that of the most stirring days of 1853. Demand for plain goods inthe Glasgow market gives immense impeiusto labour. For fancy goods a fair inquiry is abroad, and the aspect of affairs is improved. That portion of the cotton trade is still, however, n an unsettled state, and manufacturers axe remarkably cautions in their movements. Yarns of the finer counts kept quite up' to the figure noted some weeks ago, and, if lower rates ruled. transactions, in every instance the change must rather be set down to the inferior qualities of the article sold than to. any legitimate turn in the marlet.
IRELAND. -(D (FROM OUt OWN COP.PM!PONDEN-T.) DUIBLI, SATURDAY MORS5IG. TFE TIrPEItYA BANKE. There is not the slightest symptom of any conclusion to the argtuments in this appeal to the Master of the Rolls on behalf of the English shareholders claiming to be struck off the list of contributories to the Tipperary Bank. In the course of the proceedings yesterday the folloving discussion ensued touching the probable amount of assets likely to be cealized for the benefit of the dep)ositors " The MAISTER of the ROLLS asked how much of the assets liad been realized? " Mr. FiT7GoBso, Q.C.-I believe between 25,0001. and 30,00O1. "3L,'TESER of the R oLis.-I sish to know what funds tho official manager has to pay a dividend of 2-. in the pound. I know of no country, except Ireland, in wvhich a di,idend -would be declared withoutt having funds to miieet it. "1 Mr. LtwLESs.-Th8 Bank of Ireland, imiy Lord, has -upwards of 70.0001. in bills, which are being realized, and he lhes made a call of 401. a-share. "'Mr. FITZGIBBON, Q.C.-I believe some of my clients are the eggs out of which the official manager expects these chickens. (Laughter.) "The Official Manager, in answer to questions put to him bv the Court, stated, that although the liabilitits of the bank .-ad been stated at 430,0001., he had satified hiiself that :only 2a50,001. could be established agaiist the bank. He had cash in hand to pay a dividend of 25,0001., besides 60,COQ1. in bills, and he was prepared to pay 2s. in the pound oil all the claims adniitt.d up to the present. " The )L-LsrEr of the ROLLS said that it was contrary to the principles on which an estate in bankruptcy was administered to calculate a dividend upon the assumption that assets to a certain amount woull be realized. The claims lodged before the Master amounted to about 430,0001., and it wouild take nearly 43,0001. to give a dividend of 2s. in the pound. I The Official Manager said that he had mioney to pay a dividend on all the clainms adnnitted. "Soine further discussion having taken place, "Tue MASTER of the RoL1s said,-A very niaterial questioni in this case is, who had power to sell the shares ? -"1r. FITcZsGBoN, Q.C., said that he liad taunted hislearnedfriends wiith,that question, but it never 'was a-,swered. "The MIASTER, of the oP.OLLS.-There were no shares to sell so far as 30 of tlle shares were concerned. There was no evidence that there were any such shares really existing. The remaining 10 would decide the question. Ifvow niuch, supposing the English shareholders were held to be liable, remained due by themn ? _Mlr. FiT%CiBBuox, Q.C., replied that the sum amounted to 73,(001." GOVERNKtENT P.ITRONAGE. By the new Dublin Police Bill, now in its passage through the House of Conimons, it is contemplated to reduce the preposterous number of divisional miagistrates from hiine to six, or two justices for each police-office. W=hen it is borne ini mind that tle same amount of duty is pelformed by one similar functionary in Liverpool, AManchester, -and other great towis in England, it is no wvonder t-lat the meditated reduction does not satisfy the adninistrative reformels of the heavily-burdened city of Dublin. Pending the progress of the bill the vacaney created by the death of 31r. Bourke -will not be filled up, and, even should the measure not become law this session, it is still doubtful -whether any new appointment would be made by the Lord-Lieutenant. THlE rOLITICAT. EXILES. Tlhree of the misguided gentlemen -who took proninent parts in the meloranmatic farce of 1848 have this week set foot upon Irish soil. Their names are Mlr. John Dillon, barrister, and at oone time an able contributor to the lVation newspaper; Mr. John Mlartini, who is possessed of some landed property in a northern couinty, where he was esteemed alike by Orangemen and Rooman Cathlolics; and Br. Kevin O'Dolherty, who followed the medical profession, but, being seized by the then prevailing mania, set upa war organ on his own account, and paid the penalty of his rasiness by a sente nce of ten years' transportation, onlv two of wvhich remliain unexpired. Having seen the elTors of the past there is nothing to prevent these men of position and fair talents from recovering lost ground, and becoming useful menibers of tihe general community. MIr. Dilloii having gained a reputation at the American bar, it is uncertain wvhether he will remain permanently in Ireland. THE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI3MES. NSir,-Ou examining the ozonometer this morning at the Town-hall, Hackney, I was much surprised to finid it had registered a larger quantity of ozone than I had ever met -with before. The coloration of the paper was much greater than the highest in the ozometrical scale (0-10). I attribute this to the fireworks in Victoria-park, wlhich is nearly a mil e distant. It would be important to ascertaiu if a sinmilar change in the papers has been effected at the other london meteorological stations. If future observations should prove that the explosion of ginpowder in a large quantity increases the quantity of ozone in the air, we may have better grounds than at present for adopting the practice occasionally resorted to of firing cannon for purifying the air durhig the prevalence of epidemic diseases.

Pr.OrEssry OF 1IABRrEu WOssEx.-On .Saturday a Slllnerotms mseeting took place at 21, Pegent-street, to consider the present state of the law affecting the property of n:arried women, Sir J. Pakington, iU.., in the chair. Mfany ladies were present. Lord Brougham was to havo presided, bnt was prevented from doing so by a domestic nilliction. At letter w~as, however, road from the noble lord, in w hich he strongly condemned the present state of thc law s in regard to the social position of nmarried women. liheChairmoan stated that the object of the nmeeting was to reuse the attention of the public and the Legislature to the -existing defects of the lawsrelatusgtomarriedwtomen, with a view to procure a remedy for those defects. Sir Erakine P'erry moved the following resolution :-" That the roles of the comrnuon Law which give all the personal property of a aswoman on nmarrae and all subsequently acquired property and earnings to the husband are nnjust in principle and injurious in their operation; that the principles of courts of eqluity, which recognize separate property in a married womoran and invest her,wvith respecttosuchproperty, with all the nights of ownership, are in accordance with the requiremnents of the age and in conformity with the opinions and sisages of the wealthier and better classes of society that, in the opinion of this meeting, the conflict between law and eqnity on the subject ought to be terminated by a general law. based on the principle of equity which should apply to nil classes." This resolution was seconded by MIr. Hill, Q.C., and after speeches in support of it from Mr. Monckton ;!,ilnes, Mr.P., Lord Derntan, and other gentlemen, was carried unaniniosy. T:HE MIErst0OrurAY PCO,nS.-It appears that the receipts from tolls, &c., in the metropolitan district anmounted, in 1854-55, to 70,020f., and in the year 1855-56 to 65,66.5!. The mileage and excpenditure on repairs of roads in 1 g;-5 amounted to 74,315!. There are 20 gates and 67 side-bars within the radius of four miles from Charing-cross, and no-geates or bars within a radius of two miles from that spot. Awithin three milles of the Cross there are 5 gates and 23 side-bars. In the ninth district (Hiighgate and Hamp. stead) the tolls wvere reduced last year on draught horses ani ether beasts, asses being especially excepted. 'SupmcMryAON;s.-A return printed on Satur-say shows that on the 1st of Jannary, 1856, there existed superannuation allowances to the amount of 541,2391. to persons who had ertered the service prior to August, 1829, zgainst 353,464. on the 31st of lalarch, 1834. The total amount of compenstion allowances on reduction of oflices was 203,9721. in 1856, and 373,140l. in 1834, whEile the amiountof pensions to such persons was 79,212!

TEZE CORN TBADE. LIVERPOOlh BfAY3I. The returns of sales of Aritsh wheat. as per "1Gazette," for the week ending the 24th inst. are 112,235 quarters, at 6Ss. 2d1 per quarter; corresponding week, 1855, 1t0.579 quarters, at 76s. 10d. per quarter ditto, 1854, 65.731 quarters, at MS. 91 per quarter. The return of sales this week isagain on aliberal scale. The foreign imports sines Tuesday axe small of all articles of the corn trade. Very little has been parsing in the trade since Tuesday, and the Peace rejeicings of yesterday have contributed to the dulness which prevails. The weather continues allU that can be desired for every descriptionl of growing crop, and the premises of an abundant harvest are great inldeed. The wheat Plant in this neighbourhood is in a very forward slate, which is evidenced by a quantity of wheat ears being exhibited in our market yesterday, fromn a field of five acres, which will be in full ear in afewd'ays. There was avery slender attendance at our market yesterday, and prices remain nomisa-lly as onTuesa(y last. WTheat sold slowly; useful sorts at Tuesday's prices; lower description neglected. Time samne remarks apply- to flour as to the wheat trade' Indian corn quiet, akt the full prices of Tuesday; oats andibarley the turn in favour of holders.

Since our lat report a great deal of moisture has fallen, and the rivers are now bank- full. The weather has again become very cold. All sorts of vegetation have rapidiy progressed, and we hiardly o ver rememuber to hare seen at any former season both the gardens and the pastuires look more prosnissing. Wheat is growiolg very fast. Upon some of our finest soils it never loolked moresluxuriaint at tlmiisperiod of the year ; indeed, we hear of very few instances otherw'ise thar. of a favourable nature; the only rosecs are whiere the soil is poor or exposed, and there is no douibt that the blighting wvinds of April shirivelled the young plant in exposed districts, and in some instances it may not probably-entirely recover. On tIme sine soil in the neighbourhood of Castle Doniingtonk the crops ore look-ing exceedingly iren. Time young barley plant has made rapidprogresgduring the week, and freiis most parts of the county the reports are favourable ; the copious showers anid genial temnperature have been of great service to this plant. Mlost of the beau fields are looking well; they ore getting very forwvard andI give g'sod Proisees. Reports are satisfactory ante the appearance of oats,which are ofsa good colouir and strong in plant. rastures are grossing very Last; there is every appearance of an abundlant crop of grass.

DERBY, MAY 31. Th-e open, seasonable weather of the past week, has operatodI very beneficially on the younig crops; the temperature has, howvever, again become colder-, and in the Peak it is exceedingly severe. Our reports respec ting the wvheat crops ace very Promising, which, wvithi butt few exceptions, appear luxurianit and healthmy; this is, usoer particularly the case on well-farmed lausts, 10 wlseh parts we never remember to hanve seenl wheat look more promising. There are certaiss districts where tlse plant has not come up so well; but this is the ease where the soil is either indifferent in quality or very muceh exposedi; anld evemi in these part. the cropo have very usuch improved during time week, Brlecy is also lookiogwsell; the blade is strong and of beautiful colomur, and we have every reasson to believe that, with favourable wveathier, there will be a geosd yield. From Usle oat dlistricts reports are promising; the plant has spread ouit, and appears very healthy. Winiter beaus are improving rapidliy, and there is every indication of a good crop. The copisus fall of rain has caused the pastures [to grow smitis great. rapidity ; thiree is also a great dleal of " bottom grass.' and we may niow, witisout doubt, calculate iipon a goodI crop of lhay, besides bountiful pasturages for rattle. Theoprice offa,ttstosk-has this week been on the aidvance. AtWBkewe]]I, withia rather thhin supply, beef realized, 7is. 6d. to So. per stone ; fat sheep, lid,. to Sd. per lb.

Thle weather since our last report has been exceedingly favourable for all descriptions of vegetation ; to-day, however, the temperatmure 5i colder. Trhe wheat crop has Progressed very satisfactorily, amidc from moot districts time reports are very favourable. On the more exposed soils the young wvheat was a short time ago looking thin, through the inclemency of the spring; the comparative mildniess of the Past fortnight has, however, operated so beneficially that the plant is fast recovering, both in colour and strength. The breadth of grouind sowvn this year with wrlscat is great, and, although in sonse instances the plasit has notcome up as well as could be desired, still, on the wvhole, the farmers have no reason for complaint, as, wvitlo but Lou- exceptions, the crops look exceedingly psromuising. The weather is also very favourable for barley, whichi is non loolking as well as could be desired. Of course, there are, as in nearly all fomnier seasons, exceptional instances, where the crops have been eithier exposed to the cutting east winds or tbe soil of a1 peer description; buti from nearly all districts where barley is growvn repozits are satisfactory. WVarm, sunny weather is nowv wanted. The fine refre-shing showers have beenvery favoura ble for oats,whmieh are, in most eases, looking well. B3eans are prog-ressing rapidIly, and promiise well. WVinter-planited are looking luxuriant. Potatoes are coming up well ; tIme periodI for plantinsg wvas faVourable, and tse copious rains have brought up the young- Plants most rapidIly. At no former season have the grass crops augiurod more favoitrably; nothing can exceed their lu-xuriance, andl there is now plenty of food for stock, with apromise of amost prolific yield of hay. A-llthat isrequiredI now is warmth andl sunshine. There has been a slight advance this week in the price of fat stock, At Boston, wvith a good show of fat shecep, an easy sale woo effected, at 7d.hper lb. At Peterbeorough there wasan averag-eshow of beasts3,and so. per stone was realized. Sheep were in good supply,and experienced a brisk- sale at 71. to 7,td, per lb. At ouxr own fat stock market besals were in good supply, and Ss. to So. 41. per stone was obtained; mutton realised 7.1d. perlb. At our corn-mark-etyesterday thesupplyofwheatwas rathemundler lie average, and there was a smallattendance of farmers and millers. The wheat trade ruled dull, and, althEoughi millers strove to purchase for les-s money linen last week, farmers were firm, and last. week's quotations were realized. There wasras muceh barley at market as is usual at this seasn of the year, and time trade was inactive, at the full rates of last week. There were not many oats on offer, for which last week's rates were obtained. Beans were an average supply, and fully maintained the currencies of the previous week. Quotations ;-White w-heat, 720. to 76s. ; red, 6Os. to 70S. ; oatr. 249. to 2sI. ; beanls, 44s. to 480. per quarter. At Gainsbocoughi, with a large supply, the wheat trade nsled f,imll at barely the rates of ha week, Very Ilittle doing in other descriptions; of grain.

We have had rain nearly every day since last Satulrday, and a good deal of it in the aggregate-in fact, more than was wanted. Warm dry weather is now greatly needed, although too much sunshine after the recent super5inity of wet would parch the heavier soils aud be detrimental to vegetation upon them. To-day tUe sky is overcast and the temperature is several degrees cooler than it was yesterday. A few days of this weather, followed by a moderateamosintofsunshine wouldgofartorepair the damAge the crops have smstained in low situatons. The wet state of the land prevents the farmeisfromngetting on with the process of cleaningthe fallows prior to the owVing of turnip seed, and, as the season is now getting advanced, some anxiety is felt on tho sumbject. Theaccountsfromthecountrythiamoering respecting the growing cropsare various. On the high and well-drained lands wiseatlooks very luxuriant ; the lati rains have stimulated its growth so much, and the plant has tillered ont to such an extent, that doubts are entertained whether the blade is not now too rank and heavy upon the ground. With a little more of the recent forcing weather the chances are the crops in these case3 ill yield an excess of straw at the expense of the grain. On the strong lands tho wheat plant hbs been laid to some extent, and has turned a bad colour from the suiperabundanu of moisture. On the other hand, the crops on the thin soils, wlhich until lately were yery sparse, have now spread cut amazingly, andthe remark which was o frequently made before lastharvegt,thatthe poorestlask, would produce the best crops, is already beginning to be c-ureip.ttbi season. Perhaps, however, it is too early yet to form an opi.au, on thqk anbiet as we have st 10 or 122 weeks betwwc us atux psje. 'With a preponderance of fine, dry weather, or indeed wsith aus absence Of those deluging showers which sometimes break-down the crops just as they are arriving at maturity, Probabilities are greatly in favour of a splendidecrop ofwheat next autumn. Barley continues to thrivesandI looks9 uncoDmmonly well, promising, as we have previously stated, an excellent yield of good Malting samples of this useful grain. oats. though not looking much amiss, have not improTed under the late Thins. Winter beatz have derived much benefit from these copious showerm and are very for-ward, Peas, in some situations, have fallen offbhut,genierallyspeaking, they are doing well. Potatoes,baving now got over the effects of frosty nights, are progressing satisfactorily, hut theywill belater than usual, a circumstance which is already indonene' ing the price of the old putatoes in this and the neighibouring markets. Here to-day quotations have advanced Is. to 2is. per sack of 15 etone. Garden vegetation is now prolific, but the first season will not be abundant, Grass sand seeds are very thick and strong on the gpround, andI there will be a fLne mow of hay. As in other cases, however, the excess of moisture has had a prejudicial effect on some of the grass crops In low situati ons. The land has been flooded, and when the water subsides it leave a gritty warp in the grass which spoils it for hay. The general cry is now for fine weather. At present no extensive damage has been done, but another week's rain will Make a considerable difference in this respect. At our Market this morning there was a full average supply of wheat for the season of the year, though it was not so large as that of last week. The qualitytwas generally very good, there being few realy inferior samples in the mnark-et. There was a full average attendance of buyers from a distance. as well as of those nearer home, and a rather active inquiry for fine fresh wheats. Holders were very firm in tone at the commencement, and it was some time bcefore any business coiild be done, millers and factors being indisposed to makce an advance upon the termis of last Saturday, which they contended was not warranted by the state of the trade since then, About an hour before the close of the Market the farmers yielded to the terms offered, wvhich were fully equal to, and in some instances a little over, those of last week, at which rates a brisk business was done, and the mnark-et was welcleared at the close, Of other deseriptions of grain, with the excePtion of barley, there was also a full average show. There was so little doing inthe latter article that we can make only nominal quotations, and those the same as last week, as will be foiad by the prices sub joined. In oats the trade was moes active, and prices were rather improved for goad samples, The senecity of haLy last winter, and the consequent high valise of artificial food for stock, have caused a greater consumption of oats thlan usual, and an impression is now prevalent thatstorks,zare very bare. In the East Riding of this county the quantity on hand in said co bs in a very small compass. This morning holders wei e indifferent about mnaking~ sales, except at enhanced rates, and, upon the whole, we write prices for this week- a little higherFor beans likewise the demand was improved, but the abundant sup, ply brought forward prevented any increase in price, and the market closed at about the rates of lad week., The demand for raps and tinreed cake in gradually diminishing, and the price declines proportionately. The following are our quotations this morning :-Wheat, at 24s. to 26s, per load of three Imperial buishels ; fine, 27s. to 30s. 6d.; bleLdurfio, 22s. to 2ist; fine, 26St; rye, i6s, to 17s. ;flne.17s,fl6d; new beaus, ll. tol17s.;fLue, 19s. to19s. 6d.,;old beans, 19s, to fife.; graypeas,.16ss,tol17s,; whitepeas, 1fs, to 1Ts, ; oats, 24s. to fiTs. perr quarter; fine, MiS. to 3sir,; grinding barley, S6Os. to ST5.; malting barley, ifs, to 41s. ; fine, 42s. The official corn returns this week show a falling off in the quantity of grain sold last week, as compared wsith the Preceding markets, but, inasmuch as we have occasionally seen in the book of one buyer alone nearly as much corn purchased as the returns contain altogether, we cannot place muchreliancon the insp)ector'sflgures. His avereges for last week are :-wheat, 7ie. 7d. per quarter; barley, Sf. ; oats, 25s. 4d,; rye, 41s. 7d. ; beans, 42s. Ilid. The general tendency of the prices of wheat in the various Markets in this district this week has been downwards, although the fall has nowhere exceeded Is. per quarter, and this chiefly wvhere the supply has been in excess of the demand. Upon the whole, the deliveries have been decidedly free for the time of the yea, and the tans of buyers has been one of indifference; so much so that at Stockfton-on Tees, wyhere the show of wheat was quite small, previous currencies could not be sustained, but receded to the extent above-mentioned, Barley has been tnonot or two instances held firmly, but there has not been much done in the trade taken altogether. Oats and beans have fully maintained formner rates, hut there has been no advance in thle quotations. The cattle trade this weekliassbeen of anaveragecharacter. Buyers have had in some instances to pay more mioney for both beef and mlutton, but the meat-mark-ets have been pretty well supplied. This evening wye liave had, we are sorry to say, anothier fall of rain, The barometer is falling, and the thermometer has got des-n to 5') degrees (Ffahrenheit), vwhch, wvithi the wind in its old quarter, N,E,, makes the weather very cold and gloomy.

NiORWICH, MkAY iL. The weatlser, whsich continued fine until Tuesday, has again become coldl and wet, andI the ground is now saturated with moisusr. The season is back-ward, and a late han-est is anticipated ; still the whseats are, wi'th fewv exceptions, reported to be looking wvell. Barley ts also favourably spoken of, tlsough the wireworm is said to have eonsmitted occasional ravages, The hay crop is ex.pected to be agood oneTurnip son-tog is forwvard, andI the youing plants are coming up well. The markets of the district have displayed a downward tendency for wheat dssring the week, but tlse decline has not exceeded Is. or Is. 6d. per quarter. In other corn the transactions are small at this periodI of the year; quiotations are nominally the same. IHere to-day the wheat trade presented a firmier apperanice. Tise farmners were not very free sellers, but at the samne time late rates were not exceeded, In other cornthere wLsbhut little doing. The prices of nferior descriptions are irregular, but the following wvere the general rates for wheat and barley :-Wlseat, white (weighbing C2ub, to 3libper hmpenial bushel), 683. to 73s.; ditto, red (weughbing 601b. to filth.), 6Cs. to 68s. ; barley, malting (weighing 521b. to 531b.), nomninally 4os, to 425. ; ditto, distilling (weighing 50lb. to 51-,lb.), ifs, to 15 s, per quarter.

READING, IMAY St The continued rain and cold wind fromn N.E. and N.W. this week have giveuk rise to serious apprehemnions as to the new crops, In some of theolow lands portionsaof the young wheat plant are under 'rater, and near. the river Loddon a good extent of grass is in the same condition. Should there be aviolent change to heat, therecan ibe no doubt but that b3oth the wheat and grass in such cases wil serioussly suffer;. if, on tho other hand, there shiould he a gradual cbange in the ferm, peratuire, thze damnage will not lie of the character or extent anti. cipatedby some persons, In one district, on the Oxfordshire hills, there was a heavy thunderstorm, accomnpanied by ball; so vivid were the flashes of lightning that two sheep belonging to a farmer were kiled, and ho was himself so iniured by the electric fluid as to be in a preenvriouisstate for some hours. The growingecrops were damag,ed bythe basil, andparutienilarilythe fruit trees, Many old persons say they never remember so cold and wet a season at the enid of the month of MaLy as during this weeki. The show of wheat this moraing in our Exehangewas scarcelY SO large as a week ago, but the character of the market for quality wa well maintained, WVith a continued depression at Mark-lanec on each of the market days this week-, it was not at all likely that our mnark-et wouldiin the slightest deg.ree be lnea different state. it is undoutbtedly tree that our millers run very short of whieat, and, thouglh they are willing to buy largely, the high price which have been and Still are ecsrent compel them to adopt the hand-to-mouth system,and they are only in a position to supply the demands of their ordfinary customers lov those current a week ago, but the cold and wet weather this week having produced a gloomy prospect of the new crop made our farmors standout, believing that unless speedily there is a cbhage in tho weather there will be arection in trade, and prices attain a higher roint thau at any market for months past. The firmness of the Eellers and the disicilination of mealmen to yield to the demands made caused great dulness in businets and scareely anything was sold in the first part of the mornig. After a time there was a little animation shown, and the beut conditiosed samples moved off at the full currencies of last Saturday; while to effect sales of ths secondary quialities holders gave way Is. per quarter. We obsered; many racks removed to the granaries without being sold. The prices current wero :-White wheat, best, 76s, to S2s.; and some 10o3 fetched 83s. and 45. ; secondary, 66s. to 76O ; the best red wheat, T6s. to 76sf ; secondary, from 663. to 7PO. aud T2t. per quarter. In the stands there was but lhttie barley shown, and certainly only a few loti of a choice quality, but so trifling was the demand for malting that it was more than suifficient, for that purpose. The terms reairzed were :-Malting, 33s. to 40s ; grinding descriptions, 33l. to 37s. and 3i8s. per quarter. In the past week the trade in oatahasrevived, and there Was a fair quantity on offer. The inquiry vas tolerably brisk, and sales wero effected with sreater freeness than for a long time past, and a litti advance on pei-dons currencies was established. Good oats, Tai;rtay sold at its, to 2Is.; and Poland, at 26s. to 29s. per quarter. Again, weobsen-ed a liberatl show of beans, tlle chief of whic: were beautifully dry 3and good. The demand was slow, still no difficulty wa3 experienced in maintaining full prices; in some cases selea obtaimed a 't1MM more money. Tbe males made to-day vere at the follovwjj. ritps-English beans, eld, 4s5, to 52s: and 53s.; ditto, la year's, 44s. to 485.; Egyptians, wholo (the trade in which was sloIw, I4s. to 315 siplit ditto, 2's. to 27s. Peas were shorter in supply thanbas been obser%aAbis for alength it time, but so liuiled apPerar to be the vrants of dealers that there srere more than wasuted. The best gray peas for grindlg sold at 42s, to MI, and the interior lots at 3is. to in. and 40s. The ftqxu-marbet continues in a Tery inactivo gtate, aid no change has Occurred in price, the fall in the corn-marlet not having been sn£fident to justify milers making any reduction. The prices current are :-Households, 56x, and seconds 52s. per sack of 2S0lb. The quantity of wheatsold last week, as showns by the return of the Inland Revenue-office, did not vary much from the previous market. There were 1,445 quarters 4 bushels mold for £S,396 2s. 3d, or an average of 74s. 7a5. per quarter, being a reducton of 10a. per quarter on the precedingweek. Additionalproof is shown of the limited state of the barley trade, there having been only 30 quarters sold for £50 17s., or an average of 33.. 10d. per quarter. At the first market this month there were between 400 and500 quarters of barley soldhere,and the sum realized was £773, so that last week more than £700 Iss was taken for barley than three weeks previously. The corn trade tbis week at most of the marets in the country has been in a depressed state. On Mlonday last at Abingdon there was a fair supply of wheat, and prices did not alter.

It may not be generaUly known that thousands of soldiers annually arrive at Chatham to be discharged from the service, and that while here, if well enough to be out of hospital, they are quartered in the Casemates or St. Mays Barracks. Mith little or no duty, and without resources except a library, these men, as a matter of course, frequent the publichouses for news and their much-loved glass-a practi;e attended with m3any bad results to the men themselves, as well as io the numerous recruits in the garrison who are influencedand tempted bytheir examples. This practice on the part of the invalids would receive a check could they regularly see the news in their own barrack rooms or in the library; and should you think- proper tonotice this communication, I feel sure that many gentlemen, not caring to file their papers, would be too glad to send them, addressed to the librarian, St. Mary's Barracks, and thus afford the means of instruction and amusementto their fellow-countrymen who, through wounds, sickness, or length of service, are sent to the invalid depOt at Chatham to be discharged.

Tim REV. DR. Hoox Ox THE LORDS-DAY.-On Sunday evening, the 25th of May, the Rev. Dr. Hook, vicar of Leeds, preached a sermon in the parish church on the Lord's-day and its observance; and, as the subject is one which has recently excited a good deal of attention, a brief sketch of the argument of the discourse will not be uninteresting. The rev. gentlemian took his text from Colossians ii, 16,-"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath." He divided his subjectunder three heads, and proceeded-first, to show the nature of an ordinance; second, to inquire whether the ordinance of the Sabbath is a divine or ecclesiastical one; and, third, to define the obligation which the Sabbath imposes. An ordinance he defined as a law or regulation made by those in authority, by which those subject to such authority were bound. He then observed that between the Sabbath, strictly so called, and the Lord's-day there was an important distinction, the fonner beingthe Jewish Sabbath, which was observedonthe seventh day, and thelatter the Christian Sabbath, which vwas observed on the first day of the week; and remarked that the Jewish Sabbath, which was a divine ordinance, had been abrogated, along with the other ordinances of the Jewish dispensation. He next proceeded to the consideration of the question as to whether the Lord's-day is a divine or ecclesiastical ordinance. There was, he said, no authority in the New Testament for considering the Lord's-day a divine ordinance, the same as the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper, which had been appointed by Clrist himself; for the simple fact that the primitive Christians had assembled on that day was no proof of its divine appointment, because they also found that Paul preached on the Jewish Sabbath. It was simply gratnitous to say that the Lord had changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the w eek, asthere was no scriptural authority for the statement, and indeed it was only a comparatively modern idea, for tho history of the early Christians showed that they considered the ordinance of the Lord's-day as one which they themselves had appointed. This was evidently also the opinion of the Reformers, amongwhom Calvin proposedthat Thursday should be appointed the Lord's-day, showing that there was the conviction that they had the power to a ppoint or change the day. This being so, it was clearly an ecclesiastical ordinance, appointed by the church from the earliest ages, and therefore obligatory upon all members of the church. There could be no doubt, however, both fromn the Old and the New Testament1 that, although the Lord had not appointed a Sabbath under the Christian dispensation, it was His Dleasure that there shfuld be one day in every seven devoted to rest and His worship, and such having been the conviction of the early Christians, they had set apart the first day of the weelk as a day remarkable for the many important events which it commiemorated. Having thus pointed out the nature of an ordinance and the character of the Christian Sabbath, Dr. Hook proceeded to remark that it should be observed as a day of worship, mental repose, and bodily rest. This idea, he remarked, was, however, not inconsistent with that of recreation. Indeed, under the Jewish Sabbath, recreation had been allowed, and it was only its excessive indulgence which was condemned, and the early Christians and the Reformers had always considered the Christian Sabbath as one the observance of which did not preclude recreation. It had, from the earliest times, been held wrong to fast on a Sunday, and byusage the word "holyday" had become almost synonymouswith the word "festival," at once proving the idea which had ever been associated with the holy dav, or Lord'sday of the Christian church. Recreation, indeed, was not only allowable, but desirable. It was a matter of importance however, especially to the working classes, that that recreation should not involve unnecessary labour, and thus endanger the Sabbath, for at present the majorityreceived only the sainiinum of wages for six davs' labour, and they would receive no more for seven. Now, that kind of recreation which had to be paid for involved emuployment of labour to an extent more or less important, and was therefore to be deprecated. What was wanted was more unpaid recreation -they wanted lihbraries opened in the winter, and the parks and fields in the smmer. He knew of nothing more delightful than to see a father and his family recreating themselves in the fields on a fine summer's evening. Iet them seek to afford this recreation, and at the same time endeavour to render the services of the church still more attractive. By doing this-by carrying out fai hfully the principles of the church of England, they would avoid on The one hand the dangers and eils of superstition, and on the other those of fanaticism. The rev. gentleman concluded by an eloquent peroration, in which he impressed upon his conagregation'he duties which devolved upon them as members of a Chlistian church.-Leeds Irnteiiqcnce,r: THE MANCHESME: SCHOOL OF AInr For More than 30 years this valuable institution has been actively engaged in promoting the great work of popular education inthis city.

LONDON, MONDAY, JUNE 2, 1856. The Administration of General PIERCE has taken another step in that downward course to which it has resolutely addicted itself ever since its entrance upon official duties. As if the questions in dispute between England and the United States were not sufficiently embroiled already, the PRESIDn has just decided on a measure the effect of which must necessarily be to complicate relations already grievously entangled, and embitter feelings on both sides of the Atlantic already needlessly and wantonly irritated. As the matter seems not to be perfectly understood, we will, in a very few words, state to our readers so much as may be necessary to enable them to appreciate the full significance of the untoward circumstance which has just occurred at WVashington. About six months ago a band of adventurers from the United States, under the command of a freebooter named WA.uxEr, invaded the Republic of Nicaragua, with no claim or pretext that we are aware of, merely relying on the power of the sword and the superiority of might to iight. Success crowned their efforts ; they overthrew the existing Government, by wbat acts of blood and treachery it is not now necessary to, state, and installed themselves, for a time at least, in the position of sovereigns of Nicaragua. But the neighbouring States of Costa Rica and Guatemala became alarmed, and commenced an attack upon the Anierican invaders, the success in which, according to the last accounts, had declared in their favour and against the piratical occupiers of the country. WARnEB and his folowers have appealed to force, and force seems on the point of deciding against them. The CL&i-rTONBWuwxa Treaty binds the American and English Government alike not to occupy any portion of Central America, and this doctrine has been applied by America with the most unrelenting precision to our proceedings. It was therefore impossible for the United States to take any direct share in WAERza's invasion without a most flagrant breach of existing treaties-nay, they are bound by every principle of international law to prevent, by all means in their power, the sending of any support to those of their citizens who are disgracing the American name by deeds of blood and rapine worthy of the most condign punishment. More than this, they have been recently insisting, not only on the strictest observance of their neutrality laws, but on a respect for their sovereign rights, which obliges every nation in its conduct towards another to consider not merely what is legal, but what may ba agreeable and acceptable. No nation ever had bound itself by its own conduct and declarations to more scrupulous and even punctilious reverence for the rights and feelings of others. The course of the American Government therefore would seem to have been exceedingly plain-to have left W.ALKER and his followers to undergo the fate they so richly merited, and to take credit to themselves for the rigour with which they observed that neutrality and respected that treaty, which they accuse us of violating and disregarding. 'Unfortunately, however, the elections are at hand. There is a class of voters whom nothlinig Would so much conciliate as identifying the Government of the United States with an enterprise such as that of WALKER and his associates. Between these two viewvs the Government of General PIERcE has for some time balanced, but at last has taken and acted upon a resolution. The PREsrDENT has sent down to the Senate a message, in which he broadly professes the doctrine of recognizing a Government de facto, whatever its origin, and thus has no difficulty in concluding that the Govelllment of W"ALKE11 is entitled to this recognitioni. Consequently, though there is now residing inl Washington a certain Ir. MARCOLETA, representative of the late Government of Nicaragua, who protests loudly against the procceding, the PRESIDENT has received the Ambassador sent by WALKER, and thus recognized his Government as one with wlichl the 'United States may enter into alliance, and one in w hose service her citizens may enrol themselves without any violation of neutrality. The effect of such a step will, of course, be to send to the assistance of WALKER and his associates hundreds of unlquiet spirits from every part of the Union, and to involve the United States virtually, though not ostensibly, in war with Costa Rica and Guatemala. The pretences on which this step has been taken are extremely flimsy and transparent. WALKER'S Government is for the moment in possession of power, and may therefore be called, by a straining of language, a Government de facto; but it is in inmminent peril of being overthrowvn from day to day by the combination of neighbouring States, who are waging against it a war of extermination, and it occupies such a position that no impartial Government, willing to hold the scales evenly between it and the Government it has supplanted, could have dreamt of recognizing its existence as an independent State. it is ol-Iy commencing the struggle which must ba successfully terminated before it has a riglht to claim foreign recognition. But ought the United States to be impartial in this matter ? The Government of WALKER is founded by their own citizens in defiance of the laNws of their country and in contempt of the treaties by which that colntry is bound. Such men have no right to any favour-no, not even toleration, from a Governmient which understands its honour and its duty, and the Union would only be making a suitable reparation for the crimes of her citizens did she employ her forces to suppress the banditti who have taken possession of a friendly and unoffending State. The recognition of such a power is a melancholy proof of the state of political morality which could counsel such a step, and the impotence of considerations of right and justice to restrain the Govermment of the great Transatlantic Republic from the most dangerous and unjustifiable courses. At the same time, the real nature of this proceeding must not be misunderstood. It is an alarming manifestation of the ideas that actuate the American Government, and leads to most disagpreeable anticipations as to the possibility of an amicable solution of any dispute with men -who seem to recognize no other law than their wishes and their passions. But it is no case of war, it is not even necessarily a ground of diplomatic complaint. The CLATTONBULwER Treaty has not been in terms violated, and it may probably be expedient in the present critical state of the relations between the two countries rather to pass this matter by in silence than to incur the risk of introducing freshl difficulties into a discussion already sufficiently perilous, or give an excuse to those who are even now only too ready to seek an occasion of quarrel. If war do come, we must meet it as we may. Let us, at any rate, have the satisfaction of reflecting that this greatest of human calamities has not been precipitated by any undue sensitiveness or any avoidable interference on our part.
In arrays of false tests, irrelevant arguments, and bad proofs, no subject is perhaps more fertile than an academical one. An University Bill makes its appearance oni the table of the House, and a discussion follows. One side tLies to make out that the University has been very remiss, the other that it has been very successful. Each rushes to its proofs, and there is a rapid discharge of tests and return of counter-tests. But the chanices are that we find neither side very correct in its estimate and choice of tests. This was the case the other night in the debate on the Cambridge University Bill. " The University of Cambridge," says Mr. WALroLE, " has sent out many great men; " therefore the University of Cambridge has been " a very effective institution." " The University C" of Cambridge," says Mr. BouvERIE, " has not CC made us nearly so intelligent, well-informed, or accomplished as we all ought to be ; therefore "the University of Cambridge has been a very "faulty institution." " There is Lord LyND" HUST, Mr. MACAULAY, and Dr. JVIEFL;, says Mr. WALPoLE. " What genius, what learn"hig, what sagacity! They got all that from the "University of Cambridge." " How ignorant "many of our young gentlemen are," says MJIr. BUovmixE. " I hold in my hand the report "of a military commission at the beginning of "this year, from which it appears that the young "gentlemen examined did not know French nearly " so well as they ought to have. It is true they "talked it ' with a blundering fluency,' but when "they came to paper-work the ' defiance of ortho- 'graphy, grammar, and idiotisms' was melan" choly." Now, we would not say a disrespectful word of that good old-established test of " great men," which, though somewhat hackneyed and rather the worse for wear, has the claim of venerableness. Still it is notorious that the most worthless and feeble institutions can always point to their " great " men." As soon as ever they are attacked there is an examination of the books and rolls. How can an institution have anythuig the matter with it which produced the immortal JoNs ? The treasurer, or secretary, or librarian, sets to work. "Let us see. What have we got? Oh, "there is a poet, and a metaphysician, a military; " commander in the t,me of the civil war, and an "American discoverer of the 16th century. That "will do very welL" A less fortunate seminary has to be content with an Eastern traveller and a Master of the Rolls; a third has a great linguist, and a fourth a Greek historian. It is notorious that an idle and corrupt college in either University is never attacked but it instantly announces how many Archbishops and Bishops it has educated, and if it can add a distinguished orator and lawyer it 'thinks its case is amply defended. This iest of " great mEn" is not a very conclusive one, for the question immediately arises, whether these great men would not have arisen all the same vithout such institutions, and whether these *did much to make them great. Institutions do not produce greatness; it is human nature that produces it. Great men make themselves, and are not made by the school or seminary where they were. But Mr. BoUvNuar's test against the Universities is not a much more conclusive one, for it simply almoUnts to this,-that if a pupil does not know his lesson it is a proof he has never been taught it, and, if young men are not so well informed as they ought to be, that shows that the University has not tried to make them so. Undoubtedly the old ciawZuTiCldu of study at both Universities -was a contracted one, and -wanted enlargement ; but, however we enlarge it, we must not raise our expectations too high, or expect the mass of young men to become iWunmivati. Mr. BouVERIE is very strong uponi the low standard of the University examinations, but persons acquainted with the Universities will inform hiim that it is vely difficult to raise it. The Universities, like other teachers, must acconmmodate tlhemselves to the material they have to deal with. Your academical youth are a genial lighthearted race, not withouLt a certain jovial intelligence of their own, which, with the discipline of society and good manners, forms the basis often of the useful man in after life. But the great majority of them feel no call to severe bookwork. You may raise the standard, then, but can you get your young men to come up to it? If you cannot, the only result is that they are "plucked," whicll is a great disadvantage to the young men, and no gain to science. Attempts have from time. to time been made to raise the standard at the Universities, but the attempt has simply ended in a general academical carnage, and when the field has been cleared the standard has descended again. But, says Mr. BovrrxP1E, " if you raise your standard you compel the public " schools to raise theirs, and then the public " schools send better men to the Universities." But there are difficulties in that quarter too. The English boy does not meet your views so readily. WVe believe that English boys make very good -workers in the sphere of trade and commerce, and can be made to obey orders and submit to a routinie of employment ; but we speak now of boys of that class from wliih the Universities and public schools are chiefly supplieda class accustomed to a freeer and a more independent and enjoyable life, and seeing more of the open air and its freshening and primitive recreations. If we are to trust grave preceptors, of all the animals that sport under the sun, not one has a greater natural antipathy to work than the English boy. He keeps his distance from it as he vwould from any dark, funereal, and destructive machine, that would make mincemeat of him and tear him limb from limb. It is true that even in this class you see your pale young student, but when you inquire you iind that he climes in with the general system rather than disarranges it. You have the fraternal testimony, that "NED " is a capital fellow, likes his books won" derfully, and all that; no harm in him at " all ;" and you gather that NED is, in short, rather a favourite, as indeed he ought to be, considering he has written the weekly verses at school for three elder brothers in succession. This juvenile class, thlen, has its sterling qualities, doubtless; but there is a difficulty in applying M1r. BouvERIEs " high standard" to them. They have many of them active qualities of mind, wbhich will come out in after life, but, as boys, they do not, as a class, take to book-work. The true and proper function of the Universities is neither to make " great men," which no institution can do, according to M1r. WALPoLE's view, nor is it to convert all young men into literati, according to Mr. BouvEmI's. The proper office of the University is to produce the high education of a certain nuniber of men, a certain fair proportion of their alzumni. The Universities do answer their object if they raise the standard of education in the country, and to that point the reforms in the University system ought to be principally directed. You cannot maLe all young men rwell informed, well read in foreign languages, in European history, or the principles of physical science, jurispruidence, and metaphysics. Youimust not criticise their French too accturately or call their honest endeavours in this department "a blundering " fluency." But, though you cannot spread knowledge quite so far as you wish out of the Universities, you can bring kniowledge to the Universities; and this ought to be done to a muich greater extent than it hlas been, by the expansion of the cnrriculrnz of study. The Universities ought to be much more than they have been the seats of learning and science, giving homes and lives of exertion to able men in all departments, and thus affording every opportunity of self-improvement to that class of minds wlliclh is willing and anxious to avail itself of such an advantage-a class of minds which, though alwvays limited in num-ber, wields a mighty influence, and ultimately directs and moulds all society.
The Law of Partnerslhip, or, to speakl more generally, of commercial association, is an important branch of the commercial code, and would be so in the healthiest state of society. Like the human frame, however, it is studied chiefly -with regard to its disorders and abuses, and explored in the process of dissolution. Were it not that creditors continually appealed to our courts to discover the persons and property responsible for debt, men might associate for the purposes of trade just as they pleased, as convenience or theory might suoggest. But human nature has no more left itself at liberty in this than in other respects, for by its corruiption it has fallen under the dominion of the law. As that law has been put in force by the creditor, and as the creditor, as such, has an unbounded superiority over the defaulter, the result has hitherto been Creditors' Law. It may be said that so it should be; but law is niot best made when it consults special circumstances and pursues a particular object. For ages the law has been framed, firstby some roughand-ready test, to divide persons into creditors and debtors, and so begin the battle with some chance of a termnination ; then to embrace as many as possible in the condition of debtors, and as much proPerty as possible in the prize to be clivided. Nobody ever doubted that an enormous amount of practical injustice was perpetrated, or rather canie to pass, under this law. Not only in every private circle in the land, but among commercial authorities of the straightest sect of the lawv, there has been the profoundest comniseration for persons brought in as partners when they little expected it ; and not less indignation against others wvho came in as creditols, when they were the real authors of the rain. But, as no practical definition of a partner can usually lring the class to anything like a nuamerical equiality with the great body of creditors, the law has been made to bear upon the former, including as many as possible in the definition, and making them all responsible to the greatest possible extent. The rule that every one who entered into an agreement to share the profits of a business should be considered a partner has, of course, a strong foundation in reason; for not only is it reasonable that they who share the profits should also suffer the loss, but it is to be presumed that no one would enter into any such agreement, or be allowed to do so, unless he had, some voice in the management of a business, and a private knowledge of its affairs. Nevertheless the rule, while it has proved unexpectedly and cruelly inclusive in many instances, has not reached many persons who have exercised the greatest control over a business, and derived even excessive profits from it. The money-lender who makes advances at a high rate of interest and the tradesman who supplies goods at an excessive price,-both of them insisting upon doing so, with the threat of legal proceedings upon e.xisting transactions, and both of them demanding to see the books,-may be said to share the profits of a business, and often do so at a much larger rate than any nominal partner. In our Courts of Insolvency and Bankruptcy, however such persons may be stigmatized anddenounced, they come in as creditors, and in many cases, it is evident, grow rich by such practices. *Whatever obloquy it may suffer, the trade of the usurer has been legalized, and the law now allows a man to derive 10 or 20 per cent., or even more, out of a trade, in the secure position of creditor, while the mnan whose dividend fluctuates from 4 to 63 per cent., and is occasionally nil, is in the perilous position of partner and debtor, and responsible to the whole value of his estate. But, whatever the success of Creditors Law in' past times, no one now maintains that the law relating to paltnership and commercial association is satisfactory for any purpose, for any state of affairs, or for any of the parties concerned. Besides that the present law does not prevent the grossest frauds,-ostensible partners, partners who don't appear, timely withdrawal of capital, and recldess dealings with money-lenders and tradesmen, enjoying the profits of partnership without its responsibility,-the law is found utterly unable to meet the great variety of circumstances under -which people may naturally and properly wish to associate for commercial purposes. Tlere is no need to suppose what may be called senti- mental cases,-such as a gentleman desirous to I set up his butler in business,-though it is notorious that the existing law does greatly obstruct the efforts of clever and industrious men wanting capital for trade. Almost everybody in command of capital, even to the amount of a few hundreds, has been strongly urged at times to invest it in a way that without the greatest precautions would draw him into the perils of partnership, or when a simple loan at interest would not be possible, or would not meet the case. There are fewlandowners-who have not had dealings with miners, colliers, briclknakers, limeburners, builders, publicans, and other tradesmen, -with so niuch of the natural character of partnership that it was necessary to escape the legal definition. Moreover, whatever may be said as to the danger of associations on a small scale, anid the probability of persons -with a few hundred pounds throwing them away if they invest them in a speculative trade, it certainly is an object to devise, if possible, modes of association adapted for all classes, all conditions, and all circumstances. The law, of course, cannot reach every case. Such is the variety of circumstances that in every instance within thepersonal experience of an individual it may happen that there is some singularity, generaJly of an inconvenient kind; the difficulties of the position are such that men of vigorous miinds and independent habits uniformly warn everybody to beware of partnerships; and many a man, after giving this warning a thousand times, has finished by leaving his own business in the hands of a partnership. Variety and singulality of circumstances cannot be avoided in this or in any subject, and the present difficulties are aggravated by the attempt of a Procustean lawv to make partnership the same thing in all cases. The law, difficult as the task is, ought to follow the variety of circumstances and adapt itself to them, instead of ignoring and overriding them with a few fictions of its own. That any law which attempts this will have only partial success, will fall short of much that it attempts, and be perverted to ill uses, is no more than may be said of all laws, the best as well as the worst. In the debate the other night in the Commons there were two cases supposed and contrasted ;- the one that of a man who lends 100l. on the express condition of a fixed snare in the profits; the oilter that of a man who lendls it at a fixed rate of interest. In the latter case might be included that of the manufacturer or merchant who supplies goods at an excessive price and gives long credit so long as the business prospers, but is always ready to come dovn and get what he can at the least suspicion of failure, or even when his own affairs require it. Surely the money-lender, who has an usiurious interest for his loans, has practically as great a share in the concern as the man who lends on any agreement for a share in the profits ? The former is much more formidable to the great body of the creditors than the latter, and much imiore destrLctive of their interests, for it is he who swallows up the profits of the concern. It is urged by some that, even if the law relaxes somewhat of its old rigour, and does not pledge the sharer in the profits to the whole amount of his estate, still it ought to leave him responsible to the amount of his whole share. Others are for putting him in the general body of creditors, holding that a loan at a fixed share in the profits is not substantially differcnt from a loan at a fixed rate of interest, wvhich, as ve have said, may be on the terms of the market, or may, on the contrary, be on terms very much above it; in fact, so extravagant as to assume a fraudulent character. Certainly, in the moral aspect of the question the lender for a fixed share of the profits less deserves the entire forfeiture of his investment than the lender at 20 per cent. The former, if the profits are fairly estimated, is no enemy to the creditors; the latter is, in fact, absorbing their propelty, for no ordinary business is so profitable as to pay such an interest. That moral view of the question is all the more reasonable and wortly of consideration now that usury is legalized and practised to a fearful extent. Commercial laws, however, must alwrays adapt themselves to circumstances, and, though they can never go flat against reason and justice without having to make amends for it, must be such as can be actually worked. That is one of the questions now before Parliament. As to the case of the money-lender, now so frequent and so prominent in eases of banhrnptcy, and the theme of; so much moral reprobation, it might be met by disallowing the claim of the lender where the interest exceeded a certain amount. This would not be, in the spirit of thle old usury laws, to protect the borrowver, but to save something for hiis creditors, 'who, of course, are usually ignorant of the transaction till it comes out in court. No doubt, however, the whole question is one of great delicacy, amd with numerous bearings of a moral and commercial character ; and we cannot expect any logislation upon it to prove immediately and entirely successful.
EGYPT. (F1?.0M OUI OWKN CORE1SPONDLTh.) ALEXANDRIA, IAy 23. The ioinbay mail of the 28th of April arrived at Suez on the 15th inst., and some intelligerce from India was forwarded to England by a French steamer on the 17th. The Calcutta mail arrived at Suez on the 20tlh, and the Ava leaves to-day on her return voyage to England with the India and China m ails. The steamer Eindostan, which brought the mail fiom Calcutta, got on slhore about G0 miles from Suez, and was floated again after eight hours, by tlhrowing overboard about 150 tons of coals. Fortunately, she grounded on a sandbank and received no damage; but if the accident had not happened just where it did she would have met a coral reef and suffered considerably. The Ava, -with the London mail of the 10th of May, brought to Alexandria 745,0001. in specie from Eingland and France for India and China. The charge for conveyance through Egypt is threeeighths per cent., and the Peninsular and Oriental Company now pay on an average 10,0001. monthly forthetransit of passengers, cargo, andspecie, which go to swvell th*e income of the Pasha of Egypt. Amon<g the passengers from China are Admral Stirling and the Bishop of Hongkong Said Pasha has expressed his intention of vigorously pushing, the works of the railway in the desert between Cairo and Suez after the termination of the present fasting month of Ramadan, so that the line niay be completed in the course of next year. His Highness has also given orders for the digging of a navigable canal, about 22 miles long, across the lower part of the Delta, between the towns of Semenhoud and Fouab, which will be of vast advantage to the country, and will bring int3 cultivation large tracts of land hitherto abandoned. Said Pasha, with all his faults, does occasionally evince good intentions for the benefit of the country, but his Highness does himself great injury by wvishirg to do everything himself, and by not having about him proper servants and ministers to whom he could confidently intrust part of the several duties devolving upon the governmuent of an important country. It is notorious that an extensive system of smuggling is nowv being carried on in this port, principally by Greeks. al Egyptian produce ought to pay on shipment an ad v;alo emn export duty of 12 per cent., but many shippers succeed in evading this duty, and thus not only defraud the revenues of the country, but drive honest merchants out of the field by being enabled to deliver their goods in England at a lower price. With proper custom-house officers, appointed permanently, and induced to take an interest in the honest performance of their duties, the smugglers might easily be put down. ARl good Mahomedans are now fasting, but the Viceroy does not conform to this-one of the principal tenets of the religion he professes to follow. Great festivities and a grand review of all the Egyptian troops are to take place next month in commemoration of Said Pasha's advent to the pashalic of Egypt. It appears that the opinion givenbythe European Consuls and principal oflicers of the Viceroy, who held several meetings to consider the claims of El Hamee Pasha against Said Pasha is that he has no iight to them. One of El Hamee's items wvas the cost of the railway between Cairo and Alexandria, his argument being that if his fathe.', Abbas Pasha, had not spent the money on the railway, he -would have kept it for his own benefit, and bequeathed it Io his son. If this principle were at all admitted, the VTiceroy for the time being would be justified in not expending any money in improvements on the country, and in hoarding all excess of income for the benefit of his family. If El Hamee Pasha refers his claim to Constantinople, it will probably be allowed to him, especially as Said Paslia is in bad odour there, and Abbas Pasha, was made by the Sultan to pay a million sterling to MIehemet All's sons-SaidPasha in the number; but it is to be hoped that some compromise will be made between Said Pasha and El Hamee Pasha, and allow this difficult question to drop. The Nile being just now particularly low, the water in the canal has not risen to the extent expected, so that but little produce can be brought down, and trade is dull. Vessels get very low freights. About two years ago the Viceroy ceded certain privileges to a company to be formed in Egypt for facilitating the transport of produce from the interior to Alexandria, and of imports from Europe to the interior of Egypt, by means of steaTatugs on the Nile and canal under the Egyptian flag. This company has since been in abeyance, from the circumstance of the projectors having presumed on the privilege granted to them collectively, by asking too much from the public to make them partakers in its advantages, and, after the allotment of 30,0001. in shares of the company to the original projectors, it has just been reorganized by practical parties on a more liberal footing towards the public, and has received the Viceroy's sanction and adherence by an official firman, his Highness himself taking a considerable amount of shares. The present capital is to be 200,0001. sterling, in shares of 201. each. The railway between Alexandria and Suez being a branchof thegovernmentadministration, the present company is the first of the kind in Egypt which has been formed under the direct patronage of its ruler with an European administration and a mixed body of European and native shareholders, for the important purpose of developing the resources of the country. The MIahmoudieh Canal has just been deepened, and among other duties devolving upon the new company will be the keeping Iup of a sufficient supply of water for navigation and the irrigation of the adjacent lands by a me;ns of steam-pumups, to be placed at its jurnction wvxith the Nile. The company has further in view to open the canal to the sea by a lock for the passage of lighters, so as to expedite the loading of ships very considerably. The formation of this company, under the auspices of the Viceroy, is a step in the right direction, and it is to be hoped that it will be the precursor of further internal improvements. Exchange on London has again risen to 100 piastres per £ sterling.

AMERMICA, SOUTHAMPTON, Ya 3L By the United State5 mail steamship Hermnann, Captaiin Higgins, which arrived off Cowes at midday, en route from New York to Bremen with the German, French, and English mails, we have dates to the 17th inst. The screw steamer Edinburgh ariived at Glasgow on Friday night with the same dates. The Herinann brings 310 passengers, the largest number ever conveyed by a mail steamer from America, $100,00 in specie for London, and the usual cargo. On the 30th inst. the Hermann passed the English bark Abrota, standing to the northward and eastward. The Royal mail steamship Asia arrived out on the 15th inst. A telegraphic despatch from Washington states that onl the 1ath a message was received from the President, enclosing reports from the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Navy, and the Attorney,General, in reply to a resolution of the Senate in 3March last, also a resolutioni of the House, adopted lay8, bothi having reference to routes of transit between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, through the republics of New Granada and Nicaragua, and to the condition of our affairs with Central America. T'he President says.- "The narrow isthmus which connects the continents of North and South America, by the facilities it affords for an easy transit between the Atlantic and Pacific occans, has rendered the countries of Central America the objects of special conisideration to all commercial nations; and pubhc interest has keen greatly augmented in modem times by reasson of the changes in the commercial relations produced by the general use of steam as a motive power by land and sea. To us, on account of its geographical position, and our political interest as an American State, the isthmus is of peculiar importance-just as the Isthmus of Suez is, for corresponding reasons, to tLe commercial Powers of Enrope. But, above all, the importance to the United States of securing a free transit across the American isthmus has become of paramount importancc since the settlement of the territories of Washington and Oregon, and the accession of California. ImpeUed by these considerations, the United States took steps at ait early day to assure suitable iseans for commercial tran-it, by canal, railway, or otherrise, across the isthmus." After speaking of the treaty with New Granada, securing the right of trarnsit, and tIme unsuccessful endeavour to obtain from Mexico the right of way at the northern e:xtremity of the isthuis, by way of Tehu-mtepec, the P'resident alludes to the importance of the narrower point of the isthmus for transit, .and the permanent interest the 'United States lias in the security and protection of projected lines of travel. He adverts tothefact that, although this Government has been solicited to extend its protecting power, and avail itself of such advantages as that protection wvould secure, still it has persevered in a systemt of justice and respect for the rights and interests of others as well as our own, in regard to aU Central American States. He refers briefly to the possession taken by the British of the harbour of San Ju:n del Norte almost in:mediately a'ter the treatv of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and of the effect produced upon Nicaragua by that act. He then advcrts to the unsettled condition if the Spanish Anserican republics, and the solicitude and regret sucha state of affairs inspired in the United States. The violent revolutions and wars with which they have been continually agitated have made them comparatively powerless-unable to afford due protection to foreign iiterests wvithin their territory, or defend their own zoil against agg-ressions, foreign or domestic. The burden of tis State of thingshas, consequiently, been cast upon the foreign States associated in close relations of commercial antercourse. In spealking of MIexico, the President shows the fact that Great Britain and France have both had occasion to resort to their uilitary power to enforce the rights of their citizens against the independent Spanish Amierican States. He likewise alludes to the fact that, although it would be as easy for the United States to absorb new territory from Central A-merica as it is for European States to do this in Asia or Africa, vet we have abstained from it in obedience to considerations of right, not less than of policy. He affirns that he has never failed to discharge the duties which he owes to himself, to his country, and to foreign Powers, and that he has never failed sternly to exert all the authority in him vested to repress unlawful enterprises, because they are in Niolation of the laws of the land which the constitution requires him to faithfully execute, because they are contrary to the policy of this Government, and because to permit them would be a departure from good faith with the IAmerican republics in amity vith us. Anmong the American republics to w;hich modern events have imparted the most prominence is that of Nicaraguia, on account of its transit and otherwise. Time President states that in their struggles and troubles, neither being strong enough to overcome the other, one of the parties (Costillians) invited the assistance of a small body of citizens -of the United States, whose presenco apparently put an end to the struggle and restored quiet by placing at the head of the Gover'nment a distinguished individual, by birth a citizen *,f the republic-Don Patricio Rivas-as its provisional President. " The message, in allusion to the established poHcy of the United States in relation to the recognition of foreign Ministers, sets forth the following principles - We recognize all Governin-its, withoult question as to their source or organization, or the means by which the governing powers attain their power, provided there be a Governmuent (te facto, accepted by the people of the countrv. " ' 'e do not go behind the fact of a foreign Government exercising the actual power to investigate questions of legitimacy. "' We do notinquireintothe causes which may have led to a change of Governuent. To us it is indifferent whether a successful revolution has been aided by foreign intervention or not; whether insurrection has overtlirown the existing Government, and another been established in its place according to the pre-existing forms, or in a manner adopted for the occasion by those whom we may find in actual possession of power. " 'All these matters are left to the people and the public authorities of countries respectively. During the 617 years of our existence under our present constitution we have had occasion to recogrnize Governments de facto founded either by domestic revolution or by military invasion from abroad, in many of the Governments of Europe. " ' The principle is vastly more important as applicable to theCentral American States, where revolutions areconstantly occurring. Therefore, when the Minister from Nicaragua presented himself some months since, bearing the comnnnission of President Rivas, if the facts which are now pres'-nrted had existed, he must have been received. " ' The various objections to him were stated. Another 3inister now presented himself, and had been received, satisfactory evidlence appearing that lie represents the Government de ctoto and-so far as such eyists-the Government de jure of that republic.' " The President adds other considerations of interest to this country to enforce the propriety of this reception. " The message states that a special conunissioner has been despatched to Panama to investigate the facts of the late occurrence in that quarter, and suggests that other measures for the security of transit must be resorted to; and that, if the present constitutional power of the President is not suflicient, he will communicate to the Congress such recommendations as the exigency of the case mayindicate. "The documents accompanying the message are very voluminous. Those from the Attorney-General comprise iustructions to prevent the fitting out of expeditions, military sor naval, for invading the territory of any foreignPowers. "The report of the Secretary of the Navy embraces various orders to the commanders of the Sesquehanna, Potomac, FilIton, and St. Mfary's. To Commodore Paulding the Secretary encloses a copy of the statement of Captain Tinklepaiugil, of the Orisaha, saving that it presents a case which makes it manifest that our flag should be shown at San Juan de Nicaragua. In consideration of these circmnstances he is directed to proceed there -ith the frigate Potomac, and in distributing tbe'vessels of the home squadronthe Secretary gives particular instructions to each commander to touch at Panama, Aspinwall, and San Juan as often aS consistent with a due regard to the interests of our coisntry in those parts, the sloop St. MIary's to remain at Panama as long as she is needed." Generally speaking, the New York papers are averse to the step taken by President Pierce, asserting that the recogrsition of General Waller is illtimed. Other joirnals aftirm that Walker shotuld have been recognized many monthls since. The Heralid contains the followisig article on the suzbject:- "If anyathing vas wantirg to illustrate the feebleness and irresolutionof Mr. Pierce's character, his message to the Senate on Tbursday would supplwly the deficiency. In that docoLm'-nt he says that the ltnited States doctrinehas always been to recognize all Governments dte facto, without inquiry intO theirorigin or into the legitimacy of their title; antd sulch is the fact, but lie goes on to say that with this doctrinie in view he refused to receive Mr. Mlinister French- And- why? Becaus-, forsooth, the President lacked ' Saisfactory information upon the question Mwliether President Ilivas was in fact the head of an establishecd Go- vernmentin -Nicaragua.' If the President did not know what was going oni n Nicaragua. that was his fault. He had a Minister'resident there. lie had ample information in the ;':biic press of aU the events that had taken place there. Ile ki.e vas well as any otber nian in the countryor he might have k-nowvn if ho liah2 chosen to know-that the livas Government was solidily established, far more of a de faceu Government than meaniy wwhich have beeii recognize-i hy M1r. Pierce's pr-decessors. And, if any further information was wvanting, Mr. French and Mis fricnd.s were ready to impart it. What has MIr. Pierce learnt since? Fromn wvhat source has he obtained that ' satisfactory information' wbich he lacked when he (declined to receive French, aild wvhicl now authorizes hiMt to receive Vijil. It falUs to our duty to record passing evsts, but wve are bo-and to say that we have yet to hear of a single event wvhich has occurred since the rejection of Fr n'. that would tend t., increase anybody's faith in the st.ability of the Hivas Govenimrent. Ve do not believe that any single item of news laxs arrived from Nicaragua, since Fredch failed, that vwas not apparently adverse to the Plivas i!:'ersSt. Oer sicarm-rg:ni advices have been eng,ros<-i! by an unbroken zeries of calamities for Walker; etnd the last-tho-e wyhich Mlr. Pierce had before i.imn uhenI he pennmd tLis message-left it a matter ,f grave doubt wi,ethtr at the timc the niessag'- -'s sent to the Senate thie Government recognized in the -. Ts"n of Padre Vijil u-as in reality a de fecto Governmn-,t. Yet it was in tiutn advices that M1r. Pierce found thie niissing information which satisfied hin that he might safely recognize Eivas. This will not do, Mr. Pierce. An oniini,av dose of gaimlon the country will swallow cheerf l :Thnt the popular gulitis not capacious enough forthis. -The plain fact is that French was not received because ,Mlr. Pierce wvas afraid of England blustering; that, Vijil was received because the same 3Mr. Pierce was afrai 1 of Douglas cutting him out at Cincinnati. Both acts sprang from a cowvardly, contemptible, disgraceful motive; and it is quite in keeping with both to attempt to divert attention from them by stealing a little of Mr. Case's thunder, and hallooing about British aggression in Mosquito. The plain fact owith regard to Nicaragua and Central Amernca is that British interests there are aS dead as lKing George, of blessed memory. For Walker the crisishas passed, There was a doubt whether he personally would be able to withstand the combined pressure of an invasion from Costa Rica with foreign troops, of a hostile intervention by the British squadron, of the interruption of communication between 3!icaragua and the United States, of treacheryin hiscamp, of a severe want of money, and, above all, of the outlawry which the rejection of French virtually prorounced upon him. But we learn by the George Law that be has safely weathered this astonishing combination of adverse circumstances, and that the Rivas Goveninent is still in existence. This prob&bly settles the question. Henceforth, apprehension as to Walker's success becomes gratuitousandpuerile. Itis considered impossible by his friends that he can fail. Already one vessel has left New Orleans with men and arms-openly, in broad daylight, after public advertisement, with the sanction of the authorities. Other vessels, in other ports, have been laid on for Nicaragua. There are in this country, at amoderate computation, 5,000 men who are ready to join Walker, if they can do so without violating the laws of the land. Nor can they be hindered from gratifying their wish. They are men witl families, and young men who seek, not the excitement of war, but a settlement in life and a homestead. They go to Nicaragpa instead of Kansas or Wisconsin or lowa, simlply because they believe they can do better there. Who is to stop then? Certainly not the 'United States' Government, unless the exit of men and women to Europe or Canada or Mexico be likewise prohibited. Nor yet England, unless her rulers and her American agents choose to exhibit a degree of folly compared to which the policy of the North Administration was enlightened and sagaCiouS. Nor even poor Mr. Marcoleta, who whiles away his tinle in copying the New England clergymien, and protesting, in the face of God, against this country having a m ind of its own We are solicitous to rouse no oversanguine hopes, deal in no exaggeration. Bat strange accidents must happen if before the close of this year the causes we have mentioned do not invest Valker with the donfinion of all Central America, from the southern frontier of Honduras to the very border of the Panama Railroad. In three months, under ordinary circumstances, he will be at the head of an army which could conquer not only all the Central American States, but Mexico and New Granada also, if need were. There are persons who anticipate opposition from England. These must entertain a singulatly contemptuous opinion of the sagacity of our Transatlantic cousins. England.has nothingwhatever to gain by impeding the Americanization of Central America ; but, as one of the two leading commercial nations of the world, she has everything to gain by the consummation of that obviously proxiiiate event. Central America in Yankee hands wvould be worth to England ten times as mnuch as it has been in the hands of the Spanish; and, as no Englishman has even broached the idea of conquering Central America oni behalf of England, this would seem to be the very thing the English ought to desire most. At bottom, no doubt, so it is. People talk and gabble about the Mosquito question and Ruatan and Bay Islands; but these bugbears are only kept alive as floats to buoy up sinking politicians. Nobody in England cares a straw about them. Our last accounts were that the English had sold the Mosquitos cheap to Walker, and taken his note, payable ne xt century, also that they were trying hard to sell Ruatan and the Bay Islands to Honduras, which thrifty State was asking a good round sum to take them. So these squabbles are sure to end.' Upon the s ibject of the sttimatutrn of the British Govermient the samie journal says,- " We have received reliable information by the Atlantic that the British Govermnent refuses to concede anything to our Administration on the Central American dispute, but agrees to refer the whole subject to an arbitrator, and submits to bo bound absolutely by such decision, the choice of reference being left to the United States. Such is the ultimeatntn of Lord Clarendon, as communicated in a late voluminous diplomatic ' note' to our Minister, Mr. Dallas. On the enlistiiient difficulty we are informed that Her Majestys Government adheres finrly to its position. Lord Clarendon says that, having carefully examined the evidence on both sides received from the 'United States, Her Majesty's Government has come to the conclusion that the charges against Minister Crampton and the thrce alleged oflending Consuls are not substantiated, and their Government therefore flatly refuses to recal tbem. Thus we perceive that on both these vexed questions our Admiristration has at length received a positive and definite answer, and in each case General Cass vwould doubtless interpret this answer to be, ' Mr. President Pierce, we cinnot agree to your demands. This is our edtimuQtant. If it be war, come on.' And General Cass, in this interpretation of the intent of the Palmerston MIinistry, would probably be about half right. Unquestionably, should Messrs. Pierce and Marcy stick to the fighting point, on the 31onroe doctrine, as our law for Central America, oreat excitementwill be the first consequence both in9England and the United States. Should this war policy be persisted in, for the sake of buncombe or bravery, many and serious inconveniences will be apt to folow to time vast commercial and financial relations existing between the two countries; but they -will stop short of war. The end will be the expulsion of the Palwerston Ministry from power through the pressuir of the public mind of England upon the House of Commons, and a new Cabinet for fresh negotiations with the new Administration of 1357 at Washington. The simple truth is that the Palmerston Ministry and our Pierce and Marcy Administration have been playing the game of braggart and sihpleton quite long enough. Palmerston, in his warlike diversions to American affairs, has descended to the old trick of throwing dust into the eyes of the people, with the vain hopc of drawing off their attention from the great budget of blunders of the Russian war. Our imbecile Administration having rapidly ran down to bankruptcy, both in its domestic and foreign policy, like a drowningman catching at str.aws, has eagerly snatched up this enlistment bagatelie and this Central American imbroghio as exnedieuts for 'raising the v,-ind,' or, to be more precise, for diverting the popular breeze towards the White-house against the presumptuous and highhanded pretensions of John Bull. In a foreign war the whole country would assuredly rally to the support of the Government; and such have been the desperate extremities of this Administration that it could not resist the temptation of exciting public sympathy as upon a question of war thrust upon us by the arrogance of England. The experiment, however, has failed to realize itsexpected results. Our belligerent President's message of last December overshot the mark. Mr. Seward and his associate anti-slavery agitators in the Senate cried out, 'W ell done ! Go-a-head ! Give us a war ! Give us the Canadas and the adjoining provinces, and you give us the club of Hercules with which to destroy this hydra-headed monster of Southern slavery. A war with England is the thing. We must sustain the Administration.' At this point the sensible men of the South recoiled. Southern senators and Southern newspapers straightway began to throw cold water upon the projected frolic of a universal war. They foresaw that the wealth and the comnnerce of the two countries and of the civilized world would be sacrificed or imperilled in a hiolyday frolic such as this. Very fast, too, the Administration itself began to whine of the horrors of war, and to sin" the dulcet stains of peace. More than a month ago the President's Vashington organ assured us substantialy that the Central American difficulty was not a matter for war, but that 'I 3r. Crampton was the only cause or pretext for a rupture between the two countries.' There is, in fact, no cause or plausible pretext, even upon Crampton, for a rupture. Had our Administration on the conviction of Crampton and his associate consuls in the enlstment business, promptly dismissed them, there would have been an end of the trouble. But this would never do with such a chance for political capital. We must have apologies, and, apologies being made, we must have these people recalled. Their recaU being declined, we presume they will be turned adrift as a smatter of course; and there will be the end of this contemptible farce on both sides. The Palmerston Ministry and our Pierce, Marcy, and CushingAdministration have been well matched. If the former has proved imbecilein action, and only powerful i empty bluster and bravado, the latter has shown that it can buy, hector, and back out with the best of them. On the Spanish-Cuban difficulty, on the Eoszta controversy, on diplomatic coats and leather breeches, on Canadian reciprocities, and on the fishery question, our fighting Administration has threatened successively the most fearful retributions for disobedience, and has backed out in each case, giving up the whole question in the most amiable and pacific style. War is, pehaps, out of the question; but there will be no satisfactory peace between-England and the United States while Palmerston on the one side, and this Pierce Administration on the other, continue in power. The true policy of both nations is to set these two blustering Cabinets aside. let them be superseded, and then, in accepting England's offer of arbitration respecting Central Ames-iea, let our newv Administration select Rlussia, and abide by the result. Our Southern States are particularly interested in putting a stop to such trillin" with their vital commsercial and social interests as that which has characterized the foreign policy of Mr. Pierce and his good mass Marcy." The IHerald is not satisfied with the feelinig displayed by the French towvards the Americans, and thus ruminates on the matter: "It is understood thatthethree officers whlo were sent on a scientific military tour to Europe. have reported that they were rudely refused permission to visit the works of fortification in France, and that the language of the Minister of War was such as to constitute an insult. It is suggested that the matter ought to form the subject of a diplomatic correspondence. We do not think so. Thle French are the masters of their military works, and may refuso to allow them to be inspected if they choose. They are entitled, moreover, to adopt wlhat tone they please in conversing with foreign visitors, and may exhibit grossness and iL-breeding if that is their bent. Foreigners can only note such unpleasantI occurrences; they cannotrefine then inito public ornational af&ionts. Before going further with this business, moreover, it will be wvell to make sure of the facts. When the commissio,n first arrived in Europe it was said that the commissioners had been wel treated by the French and Russians, but scurvily by the English. It is now confessed thatnothing could have been more gratifying than their reception both in the British camp and at the Horse Guards. It lias also been stated, and again denied, that the commissioners wero badly used in Russia; that permission was refused thesii to inispect works, &c. This French story anay possibly he of a piece with these. It is not certain that the commission has yet reported; strong opiions had best be withheld till they do. At the sane time it oiilght not to be concealed that of late the tone and attitude of thie French towards the United States have been far from worthy of the ancient alliance betwveen the two conntries. A systematic abuse of everything American is a chronic feature in the leading Paris papers. Book after bor,k on America appears in Paris, each more scandalously false, snore it.sulting, more meanly injust than the last-the mantle *f De Tocq'ieville and Chevalier has fallen upon the ihoulders of a parcelof P'arisian Trollopes. Alltheoldslanders I which used to be current in England, but which experieace and cowinion sense long since kicked into the gatter ana the columns of the Morning Pose, have been revived, rahashed, recr'ined in France. Most respectable organs of Frenh opinion have described the Americans as a rame relap,ing into barbarism, and equally divided between pirate-s and slave traders. Now, so far as this goes, it is harn,less enough. No one has anyobjection to it here. Bnt if it is the sentiment of the French people-if Paris rly feels tow ards the Urnited States as these nevwspaper writers and bookmakers appear to do-it is quite necessary that we should be aware of the fact. It not do for Americans to labour uander a false impression in so important a matter." Great excitement had been caused at New Orleans by the recognition of Padre Vigil by the President as Minister from Nicaragua. The intelligence stated that the entire South was alive in consequence. The steamship Daniel Webster, which would probably sail from New Orleans on the 22d ult., would, it was expected, convey plenty of recruits. The steam frigate Susquehanna had sailed from Philadelphia for San Juan del Norte. She conveys important despatches to Colonel Wheeler, the American Minister at Granada. The Susquehanna will be delayed a few days at Fort Mifflin to receive aiununition; she carries 15 guns. In the course of a fortnight there would be in the harbour of San Juan the American war steamers SusqueI hanna, Fulton, and Merrinac, and the frigate Potomac. The sloop-of-war St. Mary's would remain at Panama as long as her presence was deemed necessary for American interests in that quarter. The steamship George Law had arrived at New York from Aspinwall with $1,700,000 in treasure. The intelligence from California is not interesting. Business matters in San Francisco presented no new features, and no improvement in the state of the markets had been noted. Recent rains had given an inmpetus to mining operations, and the receipts of golddust were represenited as being larger than for some time previous; money was tight, and in unusually brisk demand previous to the sailing of the steamer. Another heavy failure had occurred in San Francisco, the house of Kalkman and Co. being unable to stand the pressure of liabilities to the anmounit of $100,000. The nigger worshiypers had. attemnpted to hold a meeting in Sacramento, but were dispersed br a mob. The Legislature -was to adjoufrn oni the'lst of April, withoiit electing a United States Senator. A lice occurred in Placerville on the 15th of April, which burned 40 houses and $50,000 worth of property. General Wool and staff had left San Francisco for the scene of the Indian troubles. The war was progresing in Oregoni, Washington, Northern California, and at Vancouver. In both Northern and Southern Oregon there lhad been nio abatement of hostilities. In Washington the Indians had been rather severely bandled, and they appeared to be resting for a time." Particulars of a terrible accident wvhich occurred on thePanama railroad, by which between S0 and 40 persons were killed and 70 and 80 wvounded, have been received. The accident occurred about nine miles froms Aspinwall. The train was conveying the passengers by the George Law, who were on their Way to California. The second car from the loco. motive, from some ca-use at present inexplicalble, ran off the line and was followed byeight others, all of i which were precipitated into a ravine 30 feet deep. There couild not have been less than 500 persons in the carriages, and it was feared that the above figuires are a. very small estimate of the loss of life whiclh has taken place. The New York papers desclibe the scene as horrible. As soon as the wounded could be conveyed back to Aspinwall, owving to the crowded state of the hospital application was made to the inhabitants to receive them at their houses, but in nearly every instance the whiteinhabitants,w loareprincipallyhotelkeepers, refused,andclosedtlheirdoors. Theunfortunatesufferers were therefore crammed into the hospital, where the scene was painful in the extreme. Some of the unfortunate nersons were dreadfully mutilated. About two-thirds of the wounded had one or both legs fractured, besides being otherwiseinjured, while out of the wlhole number but one had a fractured arni. One or two had their skulls broken in. One wlhole family, consisting of father, mother, and five children, with the exception of one child, was killed, and some had their heads completely severed frolm their bodies. The New York pacers publish the official correspondence whichl has taken place in the affair of the Panama massacre, including the letters of Captain Bayly of the United States' ship St. AMary and the Governor of the State. The documents;- says the 2Aew York Herald, wholly fail in exculpating the authorities from the charge of having contributed to the disaster. The statements which they have made are all flatly contradicted by reliable witnesses, and it now remains with the American Government to exact that satisfaction and indemnity for the sufferers which the gross misconduct of the officials entitle them to. The lNew York money-market -was unchanged. The demand was not active, and the supply fully adequate. Foreign exchanges were quiet, and no large transactions were reported for the steamer. Bills on London were quoted at 109k ; Paris, 5f. 16,1 c. to 5f. 15c. The stock-market exhiibited a better tendency, and in several of the leading speculative securities the transactions during the week were quite extensive. The Asia's news checked sales of cotton, which were limited to about 500 bales, not sufficient to establish prices; hence the market continued to be rather unsettled. Flour was about 60c. per barrel higher, with a fair amount of sales. Wheat sold at $1 45c. to $1 0c. for Southern red, and at $1 50c. to $1 'i5c. forwhite ditto. Corn was in good supply, and heavy. There were sales of Southern mixed at 55c. to 56c., and yellow at 57c. No sales of prime white were reported. Rve was fmnn, with sales of Northern at 80c. to 83c: Pork was inactive, with light sales at il9 25c. for mess. Lard was higher, and small lots of prime brought 10Lic. Sales of 400 to 500 hogsheads Cuba muscovado sugars were made, and 250 hhds. common to good fair New Orleanis were sold by auction at rates about 8c. lowser than the last current prices, although the sale could not be regarded as a fair criterion of the market. Rio coffee was quiet, in view of further public sales to come off. A cargo of 1,450 bags St. Domingo had been sold for export at p. t., and some small lots Laguayra at l1e. to llic. Freights continued firm to English ports, and 30,000 bushels of wheat were engaged for Liverpool in bulk and bags at 5?1d. to (6d. per bushel, and about 2,000 barrels of flour at 2s. Od. (DY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.) LIVERPOOL, Su.-DAty EvxNsaG. The Royal MAail steamship America has arrived from Boston and Halifax, with dates from New York to the 20th, and by telegraph to the 22d ult., and $774,692 in specie on freight. The Royal Mail steamship Canada, hence, had arrived at Halifax. In the Senate Mr. Cass had given notice that he should ask- leave, when a convenient opportunity presented itself, to show that he had been misunderstood in certain correspondence by Mar. Crampton wvith the British Govermnent. There is no further definite news upon the subject of the Central American difficulties. The Cabinet were deliberating on Lord Clarendon's despatch. The Yet', York Herald, writing in reference to the despatch, says:- "We apprelhend that this ultimatumn of my Lord Clarendon, and this late Padre Vijil coup, d?tat of our warlike President, will result in a more voluminous diplomatic correspondence than all that which has been inflicted upon us during the last twelve months. kfter the national democratic presidential nominating convention, however, we are disposed to believe our Pierce's Administration will be prepared seriously and honestly to proceed to business in the settlement of our difficulties with England; and this convention, fortunately for the great financial and commercial interests of both countries, meets at Cincinnati on the 2d of the coming June." In aother article upon the sanme question it says:- " It has coaie to this-that either Great Britain or tle United States must break down upon the question of enlistment. There can be no longer any doubt that we sliall dismiss Mr. Crampton. That will be an act offensive to the present British Ministry, and it will be met by a refusal of that Government toname his successor. Diplomatic intercourse between the two nations wi)l be suspended; but that amounts to little, and is soon disposed of. Tlien, are' we to recede or undertake the dislodgement of the British authoaities in Central America ? That is the qucstion. The President says in his special message that Central America has become exceedingly important to this Republic in view of our positions and trade on the Pacific side of the continent. We have so stated to the Government over and over again. The Isthmus is important as a higaway, as a great channel of trade, and as a bonad of union between our extreme west and our extreme east. It is precisely this fact which has made Great Britain so strenuous to govern in Central America, and which vill induce the Palmerston Ministry to adhere to its preseat line of policy. They will continue to colonize iu that Iegion. They -will go on enlarging their colonial estaes, and they will, if need be, fightforit. Ithas becomeaquestionof might; tbe diplomatiefeaturesof thecaseare nolongervi.'ba It is now whether we have the means, the courage, and the disposition to prevent England's determination from being carried out. Let Mr. Crampton be dismissed. Let the issue be made. Let the question be tried. Mr. Buchanan at Baltimore said we had the largest commercial marine in the world-that our navy was only third or fourth-rate. Mr. Buchanan might have added that we have a vast seaboard, and great trading interests scattered aU over the world, and he would have presented the case in a stil stronger light had he added that the first and second-rate naval Powerswere greater than all the others combined. All this bears upon the Central America affair; it touches the question of might. We have good arguments, strong convincing facts. Great Britain has n great navy-strong and powerful means of aggression. We have no national polcy, no traditional ambition. England is anchored to a system of aggressions and encroachmient which have become the lawr of her nationality. In this spirit she has determined to attain control in Central America, and she will relinquish this determination only at the end of a war which shall prove our power on this side of the water to be equal to our pretensions." The aeaw Yor7 Courier and EBnqirer says " England alid the united States will not go towarexcept upon the direst necessity that may arise, but we cannot believe that it will. We shall see Mr. Crampton leave us with much regret, but withlittle apprehension." The Washington correspondence of the Tribuie reports, in reference to the dispute between Mr. Clayton and M1r. Crampton, that the latter explains the issue of veracity by saying that Air. Clayton called on him to examine some old English maps on which Ruatan and Jamaica were designated and coloured in the same way; whereupon Mlr. Clayton adinitted tnat both were evidently British possessions. With regard to the new Nicaraguan MkIinister the same correspondence says,- " The foreign legations determine not to recognize the i Padre Vigil, socially or officially. It also reports that mL Sartiges had endeavoured to effect an arrangement between the Governments of England and the United States." Information had been laid before iMIr. MIarcy, showing that Commodore Vanderbilt and Joseph L. WNThite's party in New York had sent a special message out to informi the British commander in the waters of San Juan that the steamer had 500 Filibusters on board, and to invite his interposition to prevent their landing. In commnercial circles a rupture between Great Britain and the United States is looked upon as an absurdity amounting almost to an impossibility. The writer of the money article of the Ketv York- Herald says, while the speculators are predicting all so61ts of dangers and damages, the merchants engaged in foreign trade are quietly and confidently pursuiing their legitimate business. The commercial article in the .ATew Yor7s Courier and ExYjuirer endorses this opinion, and, relying upon the good sense of the people in both countries, and the honesty and the well-known sentiments of the Cabinets at Washington and London, has no fear as to a rupture upon the questions now pending. The Jamaica papers profess to have advices from San Juan that General Walker had attempted an attack on Greytown, when the BrAtish frigate Eurydice had fired on him, killing 26 of his mien. The report is supposed to be an exaggeration of the affair between Captain Tarleton and the steamer Orizaba. Advices from Kansas report that an engagement was shortly anticipated. Both sides were well armed and had field pieces. The dates from Havannah are to the 14th ult. TheFrench sloop of warPenelope was in the port. She was to leave at the end of the week for Nicaragua. The British brig of war Daring had left on a cruise. There were 300,000 boxes of sugar on hand, and prices a little higher. Molasses were scarce, and held at 5 to 5. reals per keg of 5a gallons. Exchange was mnore favourable. The house of Niguden, LIarolle, and Co. had applied for the introduction of 40,000 apprentices. 100,000, they state, are required. From the New York commercial advices we learn that inthe stockl-market a dull feeling prevailed, and the transactions which took place were at lower prices. There was a tightness in the money-market; the crurent quotations were 7 to 8 per cent. for prime short mercantile notes, and 8 to 9 per cent. for four to six months ditto. Foreign exchanges were firmer; bills on England were in moderate demand at 109k, 1097, and 110; bils on France were quoted at S 16' to 5 18f. The cotton-market was firm, with a fair demand at lc. to J6. advance. Flour had improved in price 12Ac. to 25c. per barrel on the better descriptions of shipping qualities. Pork was easier, but beef was heavy. The Scotch pig iron was selling at $32 to $33 six months. Freights to Liverpool were easier-namely, for cotton, 3-16 to 7-32 of a cent per lb.; flour, 2s. to 2s. 3d. per barrel; grain, 5d. to Gd. per busheL To London, flour, 2s. to 2s. 3d. per barrel.

ST. JOHN'S, NEW BRUNSWICK, 3hAy 22. Governor Sutton dissolved the Assembly, wlhere- upon his council tendered their resignation, which i was accepted. QUEBEC, ML%-y 22. The Canadian Ministry resigned. The Assem-bly voted its confidence in them, but a majority of Upper Canadian members was against them. There are rumours that Colonel Tacke is sent for.
A Cabinet Council was held at the Foreignoffice, Downing-street, on Saturday afternoon. The MInisters present were Viscount Palmerston, the Lord Chancellor, Earl Granville, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Earl of Harrowby, Sir George Grey, Earl of Clarendon, Mlr. Secretary Labouchere, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Charles Wood, the Right Hon. R. Vernon Smith, the Duke of Argyll, Lord Stanley of Alderley, and the Right Ron. 31. T. Baines. The Council sat three hours. THE SPIitrrUAL WANUS OF PLTMISTEAD PAnIs H.- The Archbishop of Canterbury has been lately busied in memorializing Lord Panmure, of the War Department, and the Board of Ordnance for some assistance towards providing for the instruction, spiritua and secular, of the large population in the parish of Plumstead, near Woolwich DocLyard and Arsenal. The population, in a few years, has increased from 1,000 to nearly 12,000 and consists almost entirely of the Govermnent operatives and their families. Schools are required for 2,000 children, and their estimated cost is 2,000. The Government is earnestly requested to contribate half the required amount, in which case Mr. Acworth, the incumbent of Plumstead, engages that the schools shall be immediately erected on approved plans. The rev. gentleman also liberally offers to build a plain chapel for the exelusive use of the artisans employed by the Government in the locality. The money is asked from the Government as landowners and employers. Mr. Acworth backs his entreaties to Lord Panmure by the very satisfactory statement that he has three certificated teachers from Scotland, and that the largest contributors to the new chapel are a Methodist and a Congregationahst; on this ground the rev. gentleman rests a hope that he shall not be suspected of " the intolerant spirit which characterizes some sections of the established church (of England)."
MYINISTERrL4 TEA TA ZEIEZTs. The customary full dress banquets in honoar of Her MIajesty's birthday (with one exception, postponed from Thursday last) took place on Saturday evening. The mnmsions of the several Ministers were illuminated, and after dinner at each of the banquets the health of Her Majesty was proposed by the host, and responded to with much enthusiasm by the guests.

THE SUNfDAY B)ADS. Yesterday the public promenade in Hyde Park and Ken. sington-gardens assumed its ordinary appearance on a Sunday. There was no attempt at music by a private band, as on the previous Sunday, nor any disturbance whatever. The weather was remarkably fine, and great numbers of people, including alarge proportion of the higher classes, thronged the walks along the Serpentine and in the gardens, but no circumstance occurred to mterrupt the common en. joyment, and the excitement consequent on the withdravAl of the music may be said, in Hyde Park at least, to have passed awvay. A band, organized by the society established for securing the performance of Sunday mnusic in the parks, played in. the Xegent's Park, on the stage erected for the performances Of the band of the Second Life Guards on Sunday afternoons, prior to its suppression by the Government. It appears that, although the Government refused to countenance the performance of mcilitary bands in the rarks on Sunday afternoons, intimation was given to Sir John Shelley, Sir Joshua Walmsley, and other supporters of the movenment, that if the people chose to have private hands of their owvn in the PRegent's and Victoria Parks on Sunday afternoons they would not be interfered with. Duiring the week workmen had been employed, under the direction of Sir B. Hall, as Chief Commissioner of Public Works, and with the sanction of the Government, in reerecting the stages, in order that military bands might play in Victoria Park on W ednesday and in the RWegent's P ark on Friday afternoons, and we have authority for stating that Sir John Shelley took tipon himself the responsibility of directing that the "People's Band" should avail themselves of the advantages of~ the st-ages already erected in both parks yesterday afternoon. Shortly before 4 o'clock a well-appointed band of 30 performers, conducted by Mr. F. Pierce, mounted the stage, and comnmenced playingthe March zrom tho " Stabat Mater,"t wnhich was followved by the Polacca, Spanish (Godfrey); Valse-" Eleure die MIarie" (Jnlien); l>netto-" I know a bank" (Bishop); "Pas PRedoubl6 rationale" (Tidswell); Grand MIarch (Hope); VaLse-Sylvan (Tinney); Selection -" Lucia di Lamniermoor " (Donizetti); Qnadrille (D'Alhert); and Gallop-"' Victory" (Anon). The performance concluded with averse of "?Partant pour Ia Syrie," and " God save the Queen." Among the vast assemhla-gewereobserved SirJFohn Shelley, Sir Joshua Walnisley. hLt., Sir Henry Halford, lt?P., and Mr. W1. Williams, IILP. The greatest order prevailed throulghout the afternoon, and the moment tho bandhad concluded the people quietly dispersed.
TEm FR.EE, COuneHOF SCOTLAr x-n & E D ADvoc. TVs EDIUCATION BILLS.-The General Assembly. of the Free Church, now meeting in Edinburgh, had under discussion on Wednesday the bills before Parliament relatirg to education in Scotland. Several of the sneakers expressed approval of the Lord-Advocate's Parish Schools Bill' as removing the test, while others objected to it, as providing no suflicient security for religious education. Eventualy the following resolution, approving the bills of the Lord-Advocate, was carried by a majority of 191 to 34:" That the General Assembly, while adhering to the resolution of former assemblies as to the importance of aecnunng the godly up-hrinSing of the young and providmng full guarantees for the relgious character of any national system of education which may be introduced into the country, werew of oninion that the hills nowv before the House of Commons on the one hand removed serious obstacles to the right settlement of tho educational question, and on the other band. gave an opn)ortunityfor a movement in the diraction of supplying theeduc ation,nl v,ants of burghs*; and therefore that. the assembly approve generally of both bills, and remit to a- committee to sct forth the views of the church in favour of a right national system, and to pray the House of Commnons to pass the same with such amendments as to their wisdomx Inight seem meet."
FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDEN'T.) I'ARIS, SATU1'.DAY, MALY 31, 6 r.ar The stato of the weather is anything but clieering. Ftrom an earlyhour this morning up to that at which I write the rain has hardly ceased for half an hour, ron:etimes coming dowVn thick and heavy, sometizues like a soft showver. This moisture has, with fewv intervals, continued from the middle of April, whcn, perhaps, it was wanted. From 12 to 15 days' raim in the montlh of M3ay would have suffliced for all useful purposes, but beyond that it saturates the e3ith, and justifies anxiety, if not actual uneasiness, for the vines and for the young corn. The inundaticrs have only aflected certain localities, and, even if there had been serious injtury, it woould only be partial; but private letters fiom several of the departments of the south state that the weather theie has been for some time still more inclement than in the department of the Seine and the adjacent districts. Up to yesterday, if the local newspapers can be credited, it would appear that not only has no injurv been done to the wheat crops, but tlhat in many places they present the finest appearance. Be this as it may, the anxiety which is the forerunner of serious uneasiness is perceptible among ;sone official persons here, which the very early produce of grai n iArica, and of which amples have cnlle to th:eEhibiLion,has failed in allaying. If this weather continues till the middle of June it will, in more respects than one, damp the joy the Firperor would wrish to find among the people at the baptism of the Imperial Prince. The order in the Moniieite of this day, regulating the costume of those who are to attend the ceremony, produces a curious efi'ect, appearing on a day -.hich is dismal, wet, and bleak. lt may be fine to-morrowv; but at the present writing it seems as if the telrible lane routsse had again resumed her baleful influence in olur atmosphere. The accounts frcsm the departmients are somewhat contradictory, perhaps less so in reality than in appearance. The difference is traceable to the character of the soil. InI Normandy, for instance, on undoubted authority, it is reported that the crops are " magnificent." In Brittany, at least in the environs of Naantes, they are in a bad condition. In Auvergne the same, 'vhile at Lyons and Marseilles the -weather is all that -can be desired. From the Basses Pyrendes we learn 'that the weather has been of the most unfavourable kind for some time. The places near the sea stifer a great deal; the plains are inundated and sodden, -hile the higher country, from which the water flows rapidly off, is generally in a flourishing condition. On the whole, it is considered that if the weather changed at this moment from foul to fair we should have a very good harvest; if the moisture continue for only a few days longer we shall have a barely sufficient, and if for a longer period a deficient one. The Mioniteur publishes the returns of the corn trade in the different markets of France during the lastweek of April and the tirst fortnight of May,from 'which it appears that the average price of the hectotolitre of wheat during that period was 28f. 44c. at Toulouse, Gray, Lyons, and Marseilles ; 29f. Sc. at iXiarans and Bordeaux; 2Sf. 2c. at St. Laurent and Le Grand Lemps; 28f. 4c. at 3ulhouse and Strasburg ; 32f. Sc. at Bergues, Arras, Roye, Soissons, Paris, and Rouen; 27f. ,c. at Salulur and Nantes; 2Sf. S2c. at Metz, Verdun, and CharlevilIe; and 2Sf. 46c. at St. Lo, Paimpol, Qtuimper, and Hennebon. The lowest price of the l:ectolitre during the second week of M1ay was 26f. Sc., at Marans, and the highest 34f. 67c., at PRouen. The receipts of the Orleans Railway during the week encling on the 19th inst. were 948,11lf., or 30, CGOf. more than during the corTesponding week of 1855. The gross receipts since the lst of Januauy amotuted to 18,007,304f., being a difference infavour of 1S8o of 1,191,041f. The Three per Cents. closed on Fiiday at 74f.

The statement of the Franlfort Post Zeitung, that unmerous members of a " mysterious religious society" have been arrested in this city, is correct, and I am able to give you some detailed information on a subject of which nothing is yet known to the Vienna public. About a year ago the police received information that the habits and manners of some of the workmen in the suburbs had undergone a very great change. In the language of my informant, " the men were more orderly and regular, and less noisy and rude than their fellows." As the phenomenon was observed in several suburbs the police suspected that some central club had been formed with branch establishments. The movemrents of some of the men were closely watched, but up to Whit-Sunday last nothing more was discovered than that, instead of going to church, they read their Bibles diligently at home, "and were so greatly a:verse to any lind of ceremony, that if one of their friends died they abstained from following the corpse to the grave." As there is not any law in Austria 'which makes reading the Bible a punishable offence, the authorities had no reason for interfering with the workmen until, on Whit-Sunday last, they held a conventicle, and 'were siuprised by the police. It is probable that some papers were seized, a3 it is known that the persons arrested (between 60 and 70) call thems9elves " Brethren of St. John," and belong to a new religious sect. Although it is not believed that the Brethren of St. Johm have anything to do with politics, they are suspected of being in connexion withtheHungarian Protestants, and it is therefore probable that some time wiit elapse before they are set at liberty. The 7MtraMontanists have, during the last five or sLx years, fostered and cherished the St. Severinus Nerean which is a union of workmen under the direction of some influential members of the igh Catholic Iarty)-, until it has become qvite a power in the capital, and it is not unlik-ly that the new sect is a kind of opposition union formed by those worknmen who have no taste for cant and Jesuitism. A gentleman who is well acquainted with the exact state of things in Hungary gives a very unfavourable account of that arown land in as far as the security of the lifo and property of persons who live in remote country places is concerned. He assures me that the Gendarmes, heavily accoutred as they are, are of little use in the open country, and are in far more danger from the robbers than the robbers from them. If the Gendarmes had not the peasants to keep watch for them during the niglht, they would be continually taken by surprise and muirdered by the freebooters, " who are now mnore numerous and daring than they were when they had the Pandours for their adversaries." The official Hungarian and Slavonian papers continually announce highway robberies and the condign punishment of the perpetrators of them, but the state of things must be far worse than is here supposed, if private correspondents do not grossly exaggerate. The following extract is taken from a letter which was written to the Agrasm Gazette, from Bakoca (in the Barany Comitat), on the 20th of May:- "A very large and well-organized band of robbers, comnposed of wvell-dressed men, with light waggons and excellent horses, commits aU kinds of atrocities, and that with unparalleled audacity. After several policemen and Gendarmes had been killed, the whole of the 23d Jiger Battalion and a regiment of Lancers were sent out against the freebooters, but unfortunately without effect. The Jaigers were in wargons, but could do nothing in the endless pustas (steppes) and woods. On my way here I was in somne danger near Istvandi, but escaped by the presence of mind of my &diver, 'who managed to mnake his four horses run away." The correspondent adds, that many of the robbers are ex-Honveds; but it appears by the sentences publislhed in the official papers that most of them are Austrian soldiers who have been dismissed or are on furlough. As nothing positive is known of what is doing in Italy, no more can at present; be said respecting the Italian question than that Austria is not likely to be reconciled to Sardinia until the latter has abolished her constitution. Indeed, men in office do not hesitate to declare that Austria can never be either a friend or an ally of Sardinia "as long as she has such a form of government and such a Cabinet." In an article in the Wienei Zeitung, which is meant to be a eulogy on the conduct of the Austrian troops while in the Danubian Principalities, are the following singularpassages- "The offences committed, which were the acts of individuals, were punished with the severity and promptitude for which the criminal jurisdiction of Austria is remarkable. The single cases of transoression against the laws only serve to bring into stronger relief the good and respectable spirit which animated the whole army of occupation." Now, official documents containing complaints of the conduct of the Austrian troops have from time to time met my eye, and I am bound to state that if one-half of theni be true the dislike of the Wallachians and Moldavians to their protectors against the Russians is most satisfactorily accounted for. Many of the organs of the Vienna press systematically abuse the Credit Bank for not doing more for the fLurtherance of the trade and commerce of the country, but it appears to me that the Direction of the new institution acts wisely in proceeding with considerable cauition. The Credit Bank refused to assist some of the Briinn manufacturers, who had speculated beyond their means, and ever since that time it has been in bad odour with their comniercial friends in this city. In order to relieve the distress of the smaller Briun houses the National Bank has established a temporary discount bank in that city with a capital of 500,0001. The capital of the regular discount bank in ruiinn is 2,000,000Q1 (2u0,C001). The day before yesterday the Emperor decided what was to be done with the Gallician Railroad, but the Ministers declare that they will not say a word about the matter until the preliminary concession orpromise has been signed by the Emperor. The Direction of the Empress Elizabeth Railroad has at length set about its work in good earnest, and appointed engineers, inspectors, &c. The engineering corps composed of 108 perSons. The Lombardo-Venetian Railroad shares will be issued in a very few days. It is stated that the griund-slceer (ground-tax) is to be raised S per cent., " so as to be mnore in propoltion" to the other direct taxes, but many people think that the griemmd-steuei- is already disproportionately high. The 1haszins-stever (tax on house-rent) in this city is above 30 per cent., and it is proposed to raise the tax considerably in the provincial capitals. A Vienna correspondent of the Augsblurg Gazette writes that the Finance Miinister calculates on being able to make a very considerable reduction in the expendit ure of the Departments of War and Justice. PRUJSSIA. (FR0t OUro o0Wn CORRESPONDsnsr.) BE11IJN, 3LKY 29. The day before yesterday the Queen went to meet her sister, the Queen of Saxony, at the frontier. In the papers it has been carefiully mentioned that that day was the 100th anniversary of the day on which their father, KingMaximilianJoseph, of Bavaria, wvas born, as though that -were the cause of their meeting at the frontier; but I have not fouind it mentioned anywhere tlat, the Queen of Saxony accompanied her sister of Prussia back to this Court. I have every reason to believe that the two Royal sisters returned the same evening to Potsdarn, and the only reason I can imagine for the secrecy observed is, that there is a project for a matrimonial alliance on foot between the Grand Duke Michael and one of the Saxon Princesses. If such be the case, the Princess Alexandrine of Prussia, whose name I mentioned in a recent letter in connexion with this subject, is not to be the favoured fair. Although this Court, as now held in Potsdam, is at the present moment the point of r6union for so many persons of distinction, in addition to the Inmperial and Royal families, there are no public festivities there, nor anything like external demonstrations; the visits appear to be perfectly of a family nature, and as remote from politics as the visits of crowned heads and leading statesmen can be. This is doubtless in part to be attributed to the state of the E:mpress Dowager's health, and partly to the short stay of the Eimperor and the irnzp-oviso style of the Nisit altogether. The household aimangements which have become necessary in Potsdam have caused the Palace here in 1Berlin to be sadly despoiled of its furniture, servants, plate, &c.; everything has had to be transported to Potsdam in the greatest possible haste. The health of the Empress, far from having suffered from her journey, appears to have gained somewhat by her return to her native air; she appears to revisit with areat satisfaction the many well-known spots in and about Potsdam, buLt wvhich have been of late years beautified almost beyond recognition. In addition to the members of the Imperial family of Russia, the Emperor,the Ermpress.Mother, and the Grand Duke Michael, there are visitinlg here now the Queen of Saxony, the Grand Duchess of Mecl;enburg- Schwerin, the Princess of the Netherlands, Prince William of Mecklenburg, the Crown Prince of Wurtemberg and his consort, the Grand Duchess Olga, the Grand Duke of Olden- burg, the Duke of NTassau, Prince Wilhelm of Eaden, Prince Mloritz of Sachsen-Altenburg, the Prince of Hohenzollern, Prince of Solms, PrinceWindischgratz, &c. Further, there are innu merable Russian nobles and State officials attached to the suites of the Emperor and the Empress-Mother, of whom I will only mention Count Nesselrode, Baron Meyendorff, Prince Gortschakoff, and Prince Woronzoff. Many members of the tvo suites have had to be accommodated in hotels here, and when I tell you that on the 26th inst. alone 102 Riissian families arrived here and took up their quarters in the hotels, it requires no explanation to show that every place of public entertainment in and about our West-end is invaded and taken possession of by the Russians. General Ney has returned from his mission to St. Petersburg, and left Berlin this morning on his way back to Paris. A day or twvo ago the men on 'Change here got up a story of a new Austrian loan about to be issued; and they succeeded in running Austrian paper down that day. Yesterday that story was abandoned, and a new Russian loan was made to zerve the same purpose with regard to Russian paper. Both reports are unfounded. In the corn-se of the past week a number of housea Idealing in Russian grain, both here and in Hamburg, reeived telegraphic despatches from St. Petersburg withdrawing -all offers still out for future delivery; in some cases the parties were still willing to sell, but only at advanced prices. The consequence has been a very considerable demand in Hamburg, and at higher rates. The accounts of the growing crops from the Russian Baltic provinces are favourable. ITALY. (sRBO5n OUR OlyN COIRRESPONDEN'r.) IAPIES, rMAY 26. "There are neither Royalists nor Republicans in Naples," said one of our oldest and most respectable merchants to me yesterday. I fully accede to this opinion. Nothing but mental blindness and obtuseness could induce a man to say that the former existed, and despotism alone would assert the existence of the latter. It suits its purposes to say, " a Republican spirit is abroad, it must be quenched; we dare not make concessions, lest we add fuel to the fire." I should ill interpret, however, the sentiment of the Neapolitans were I to say that they would be contented with anything less than Constitutional privileges, and this I think will follow as a corallary from what I asserted in my last letter, that they would now accept as final any plan which would secure the good administration of the actual laws and the vitality of the Governmental machinery -which exists throughout the country. Now, the only plan by 'which these objects can be effected is, in their opinion, a moderate constitution adapted to their social position. They regard it as a necessity for many reasons. First, such laws Iand such political machinery as exist in this kingdom are not in harmony with absolute power-they have too many of the elements of freedom to permit of their working well together with despotism. One of the twvo must succumb, as has been the case. Could they, however, be broughlt into harmony, the inhabitants of this country regard their Sovereign as perjured. They have lost all faitlh in the Royal word, and would as soon trust to any promises of improvement and better conduct for the future as they would to the idle words of a parrot. The great party, therefore, in this country is folmed of Constitutionalistq, and it augurs well for the success of any political experhuents that, while excesses of opinion and feeling have moderated and almost disappeared, there is a perceptible and growing admiration for English institutions and for the sober tone of the English character. I mnst add, however, that there is another reason why they demand a Constitution. It is the only mode by which a termination can be put to the social corruption which avowedly exists, and by which the national character can be elevated. The feeble or wicked advocates of absolute power in :aples too often urge as an argument against a Constitution that the people cannot work it. In other words, the corrupting influences of an iniquitous system of government have been so successful that the virility of the national character has been emasculated, and the victim lies powerless on his back. I may be permitted at this important crisis to give the experience of one who has long known the country "'That it is demoralized, I admit; that it has become so by a long continuation of bad govermnent, I assert, as I do also that it will become yet more demoralized if the present system of government be persisted in. The connexion between theGovernment and social coirription in this country is to I my eyes as evident as is that between the i different parts of a mathematical demonstration. %Vhetlier the Neapolitans merit compassion is a matter of opinion. I think they do. Their history shows a constant impatience of despotic rule. This is the only country in the souith of Europe where it was found impossible to introduce the Inquisition, and periodical risings have for many years proved that vitality is not extinct; that liberty is warmly appreciated and eagerly desired." " WVhy don't they I win it for themselves? " " So they would were X they not crulshed by the double powver of their own Sovereign and that of Austria." "Vs'hy have they not preserved it when it has been within their i grasp? " " Because they have never been treated with anything like honesty, and were a Constitution granted here to-morrow it wouild not be accepted by many, nor would it work unless, as Count Cavour suggested in the Legations, a foreign coimmission were present to see fair play." I confirm w hat I said in my last, that the Constittitionalists are calmer because they are looking with confidence to the West. If disappointed, be assured that yet another proof will be given of the national impatience of despotic misrule. MIuch has been talked out of Naples about an aninesty, and if anything be done of course the absolute Powers will be glad to put it forward as the great finlal concession. In truth, however, it is only an incident, and, whatever prominence may be given to it by feelings of humanity, it is only a very slight incident in the Neapolitan case. His Majesty is still at Gaeta. Prince Satriano, accompanied by General d'Agostino and MIajor Bianchi, confidants (the two latter) of the King, it is said, is gone down to visit the estates and mines and foundry of the Prince. It so happens. I however, that the Govermnent has extensive foundries tlhere, and that great quantities of ball are made there. There may be some significance in the visit, especially as His Majesty is said to assume an attitude of defiance. Prince Castelcicala is still here, and I should not be surprised at another appointment to the Viceroyalty of Sicily. There has been a diminution in the export duty on oil. As our flag enjoys the same privileges -with the national flag in exporting to British ports in the united kingdom or any part of Europe, the duty may be set dowvn now at about one half what it was. If exports are made to other ports in British bottomUs, a heavy differential duty is demanded, and this is what I meant when I spoke in my last of suchI a trade being prohibited. The actual duty oni oil, as affecting the British merchant, is about 41. 1s. the ton, the exchange being at 534 the pound sterling. Like everything else in this country, the commanid of the King (for so is it worded, not the decree, &c.) is too late to be.a boon. It would have been so six months ago; but now that the oil of every other country has been bought up the case stands thus:On beard ship the article may be set down at 451. the ton; to this add 71. for expenses, and it will arrive in England at 521. the ton; whereas the last despatches quote oil in the English market at 471. the ton. At present, therefore, the exporter would lose 5l. the ton by his speculation. The exchange has risen twro points, and it seems to have an upward tendency. There are hopes, therefore, of some change in the price of silver on the 15th of June. No silver has been imported since February. (nRaot ouR OWN ConnxsPoNDXTr.) TURIN, MAt 27. One advantage at least has been gained by the present controversy on the state of Italy, and that is the clearer definition of the relative positions of Sardinia and Austria. Many people may fancy this was unnecessary, as the case was evident enough before, but for the world at large it is satisfactory that the exact terms on which these representatives of rival initerests enter the lists should be acknowledged by both sides, and thoroughly understood by the public, which must ultimately perform the office of umpire. To the objections raised against her political institutions of course the reply of Sardinia is very simple. She claimed to be an independent State, and as such had a right to make what changes she thought proper in her internal government. For the rest, the Piedmontese people consented to pay a large sum to Austria in 1849, as indemnity for the ex!penses of the war, rather than sacrifice the freedom which their Sovereign had conceded to them. Their country has been free from conspiracies and insurrections since the people obtained a reasonable amount of liberty. So far from Piedmontese liberties being dangerous to other Governments, they have served to convince thepeopleof Italythatthe enjoyment of freedom is perfectly consistent with the preservation of a monarchy and aristocracy, and thereby to wean them from the errors of the Fench revolution; but the Ministers of the King of Sardinia never thought of asking for other parts of Italy a constitution such as their own Sovereign granted and they have proved themselves so well able to maintain. Theyknewwell enough they could.not obtain and could not enforce such a request: all they demand is that foreign occapation shall cease and the country be restored to its normal state by placing it under the guardianship of national troops and police. In order to render the i emoval of the armies of occupation pelfectly safe it is necessary that certain changes in the administration should be previously made in the Roman States and native troops organized, but there never was any proposal for a Parliamentarv forni of government, or, in fact, for anything of a more popular nature than what nominally exists in Loim tardy-a Yiceroy, assisted by provincial coiucils- only there was the awkward suggestion attachled to it, that the execution should be guaranteed bv thegreat Powers. Remove that clause and the Courts of Rome and Vienna willagree to allthe restwiththe greatest alacrity, knowing welL that they can render all the rest null and void under their own peculiar system of carrying out reforms. In 1848 Pope Pius IX. kindly suggested milder measures to the Emperor of Austria in dealing with his Lombard subjects, reminding him that the rule -which relied solely on steel could neither be noble nor happy: it remains to be seen what good advice the young man has to give his spiritual Father in return m 1856; but your readers will not be surprised if it does not prove more effective for the welfare of the country than wvhat he received. I Count Colloredo, who is specially charged with the delicate mission of presenting the Austian sug- | gestions of reform to the Court of Rome, has IOW I veen some days at his post, and, although received with all courtesy by His Holiness himself, is said to have been not very favourably viewed by the Cardinal Secretary and his friends, as it was suspected that one of the propositions in the Cotunt's instructions referred to the transfer of the portfolio of Secretary of State from the hands of Cardinal Antonelli to those of Cardinal Viale Prela. Siuce his arrival in the Eternal City Count Colloredo has had several conferences -with the French INinister, but I have good authority for stating that up to the present time they have not been able to decide on a united course of action with regard to the " note" to be presented, M. de Rayneval feeling, probably, that in associating himself vitlh such suggestions as Count Colloredo is authorized to make the country he represents would not gain either ii influence or popularity, as they would neither render the Papal Governmnent more independent of Austria nor content the desires of the people. The Opiniome, in a correspondence. from Rome, publishes an instance of Roman intolerance which, as I have heard it confirnmed from other quarters, deserves to be repeated. An English lady lately lost a daughter at Rtome, and on the tomb (which was in the English Protestant cemetery) she wished to have the verse from St. Miatthew, " Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God," inscribed, but it appears that some officer connected wvith the censorship entered the workshop of the statuary who was working at the tomb, and forbade him inscribing more than the first half of the verse, as he said it was neither right nor just that heretics should see the Lord. THE BALTIC. (FrO3M oUR OVNYN CORRESPONDMTr.) H{AMBURG, MAY 28. Our city has recently, and since the reopening of the navigation between the German ports and those of the Baltic and Gulf of Fin-land, been somewhat enlivened by the presence of a number of Russian visitors, who, on account of the nmunber of " golden imperials" they usually bring with them, and the liberal way in which they spend them, are much cherished by the hotel and shop keepers of the place, who seldom fail to reap rich harvests at such seasons. MIany more are successively expected, as, from vwhat some of them report, above 50,000 personls of all grades have applied for permission and passports to travel abroad. M;Iost of them, after refreshing themselves with the good things that are placed before them here, and especially having fitted themselves out from head to foot with all that is fashionable in point of dress, pass on to Paris and Soiuthern Germany to spend the remainder of the tiue allowed them on leave of absence from their homes and families. It is truly astonishing to witness the great anxiety and avidity displayed by the various tradesmen, aided by the commnissioners of the hotels, in looking after these travelling Russians, and the manmer in which they are fleeced. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, they all appear, however, to feel extremely grateful to their Emperor for allowing them to enjoy the fresh air of the places in wvhich they sojourn for the time being, and are especially glad that the waris at an end. SPAIN. Ouir accounts from Madrid are of the 26th nilt. The Cabinet had lately held several Councils to decide on the course to be pursued with respect to BMexico. There is every reason to believe that Spain wil declare wvar against that Republic, should the latter refuse to execute the stipulations of the treaty of 1853 in favour of the Spanish subjects whose claims had been solemnily recognized by the Mexican Government and contiried by a Legislative vote. The MIinister of Finance had presented to the Cortes a project of lawr, in virtue of which horses and mules lately purchased in difHerent provinces of Spain by the English Government, and about to be sold at Gibraltar, will be readmitted into the kingdom free of all duty, provided the buyers be Spanish subjects. "Tlis law," said the MLinister,- "1 Is rendered necessary and justified by the obligation under which the English Government is, in consequence of the treaty of peace, to dispose of a considerable number of horses and mules it had purchased in the Peninsula and assembled at Gibraltar for the wants of the war. The Queen's Government has thought proper to make an e\ception in favoiur of horses and mules of Spanish origin, which had been purchased in Spain, and are to bo re-imported, because a considerable lenefit will result to the agriculture and comimerce of Spain from the extremely low rates at which they may be obtained on account of the pressing necessity for the Lnglish Government to effect their sale. This project of law, besides being based on reasons of equity, is dictated by a sentiment of deference towards the Government of a friendly nation and ally of Spain." It was said that a newv settlement of the debt was intended, but nothing had been decided either on that question or the one relative to the English Coupons.

The funded property of the society produces a sum of 6401. yearly, and the gross annual income at the disposal of the trustees is about 1,0001.

NovEL AND LTaPoirTANF ExEnFiRts:E.-On Thursday about 25 agricultural labourers, with their wives and families, left the Brooanielaw, Glasgow, by the Beaver steamer, enl r ouItC for Liverpool, whence they sail on Saturday for Turkey by the screw steamer Arcadia. They are under the charge of and are accompanied by MTr. Gebbie, lately farm overseerto Mr. Dixon, of Govan Ironworks, and are to be employed, under him, in introducing the Scotch system of farming among the Turks and Greeks, upon a beautiful and extensive estate acquired by Mr. Thomas Parry, situated about 12 miles from Constantinople. Mr. Parry has been long domiciled in the dominions of the Sultan; and, seeing the slovenly and unproductive mode of rgriculture pursued by the natives, he resolved to offer the example of a better system, both for the improvement of his owvn property and for the benefit of the ignorant Turkish -ultivators in general. He accordingly sent a commission to Messrs. Edmiston and Mitchell, of Glasgow, to secure a iompetent overseer and a number of industrious and intellient Scotch peasants, and to send thern, with agriculiural implements, &c., to Constantinople. This commission, <o far as -we learn, has been executed by these gentlemen with great success and ability. In addition to the 1 uman freight already alluded to they have sent off agricultural implements- of every variety and of the very best e scription, consisting of ploughs, harrows, spades, rollers, &c., which have all been supplied by MIessrs. John Gray , r d Co., of Uddingstone. They have also fornarded a large tepantity of most valuable agricultural seeds, which have lecen furnished by Mlessrs. Alexander Cross and Son, of ilatsgow. The eatent of the consignment of tools and seeds may be understood xhen we state that three spacious railvway waggonawere filled bythemtotheroof. Another detachment of agricultursl labourers is seen to followu. Of itself ibis consignment may be of little amount when compared wvith the vast mag,nitude of the exports of the Clyde, but its coneqouences are likely to be of the most beneficiaicharacter, w en we look to the effect natursely to be produced by the planting of an intelligent agricultural colony in the midst of an-ignorant but tractable people, w;ho enjoy a soil and climnate so rich and rare that three crops of hay for instan.ce may be produced in the course of the year. We have reason to. believe that this coasigsment of meniand I saterial i5 likely, in due course} to be followed by otheri.
IN DIA. (FROM OUR OWN CORRFb-PONDMW.) CALCUTTA, AmRa . The singular lull in political affairs still continues. :Not an event of any kind has transpired within the fortnig,ht. Lord Caning has as yet done nothing of which the public can take note, and intil he adopts some decided line of action all great questions must rernain in abeyance. Oude, the only quarter from which events are expected, remains profoundly quiet. The last of the great nobles has sent in his adhesion, and " the peasantry," say my letters, "openly -express their satisfaction at the change. The ex-King is slowly moving towards Calcutta. He intends, it is said, to proceed to England and there lay his grievances before Her Majesty. He is surrounded by Europeans, some of whom, I fear, look on him very much in the light in wlhich harpooners regard a whale. One of them is a gentleman, but the ideas of the rest are said to be of the most singular description. They believe that the King's arrival in England will be a kind of thunderbolt, that he will present his card at Bucking2am Palace, and in a sinlgle interview w;ith HTer Mlajesty destrop the Court of Directors, regain his throne, and aninihilate Lord Dalhousie. It is doubtful, even now, whether the ex-King, who is somewhat fat and very timiid, will venture upon the voyage. Meanwhile General Outram has taken sick leave. He is really ill, and it will not be a very easy matter to supply his place. It is said he is only going for six months, but lie is much broken and will scarcely return to so arduous an appointment. I perceive the revenue estimate for Oude which I sent you has been questioned. I carefuUy distinguished between the official and non-official account, but there is no reason to believe the latter exaggerated. The half of the kingdom which we previously absorbed really does yield the enormous amount therein set down. The second half now annexed is as rich in grain-bearing land and rivers, and far richer in minerals. M1r. Thornton's estimate of the population-3,OOQ,OOOis much below the truth. The first report, however, which will be ready by MIay, 1857, will clear up all these difficulties. The Government has recently had a project under. consideration of some interest to seamen. To the south-east of the Bay of Bengal lies a group of islands called the Andamans. They cover an area larger than that of Suffolk, and are knowvn to be fertile, well wooded, and full of harbours. They belong to the British, but for some unexplained reason have never been occupied since they were abandloned in 1784. At present they are thinly populated by a tribe of degenerate negroes or Malays, who are certainly wvreckers, and are suspected to be cannibals. The crews of several vessels wrecked on the coast have been murdered, and the islands, which might be made ocean houses of refuge, are a nuisance in the bay. It was supposed that they were unhealthy, but the supposition has been disproved, and the Government has proposed to abate the nuisance. The matter has been referred to England, but I can scarcely imagine that the Court will refuse its consent to a measure demanded by the entire civilized world. Ia the absence of more exciting intelligence I may enter into some detail ontwo subjects now attractingmuch official attention. They do notmakemuch figure in the newspapers, but that in this country is no proof that they are not very seriously discussed. One of these subjects is the position of our judiciary. It is not a little peculiar. The comumon law of Bengal, as you are aware, is the Mahomedan la-w-the Koran as interpreted by the Arab doctors. Upon this basis has been erected a great edifice of statutes, constructions, and orders, vhiclh form a system of law almost as complex as that which you in England are trying to improve. UJnfortunately, while our laws have thus changed their character, our judiciary has not been remodelled. The covenanted or higher judges are still selected from among the executive officers of the State. Though men usually of considerable acquirements, and frequently more than average ability, they are deficient in knowledge and in training. The first defect renders them deficient in self-confidence. The second gives them a tendency to a pedantic adherence to legal forms, to the letter rather than the spirit of the law, which sometimes impedes the course of justice. This is more especialy observable in the criuminal department. The judges refuse testimony which would instantly be accepted by an English jury, and decline to attach the slightest weight to circumstantial evidence. They propound the most original theories about piuishment, and quote English law phrases without the most distant appreciation of their meaning. For instance, a few weeks since a eoman was t-red for drowning a child for the sake of its ornaments. The evidence was sufficiently conclusive. It was, however, just possible tliat death might have been accidental. The judge, who decides on the facts as well as the law, gave the prisoner the " benefit of the doubt," and oeel.bj transported her for life. The story seems incredible, but I give it you from the official record, written by the judge himself. To add to the confusion, every sentence of any importance is appealable to the Sudder or Appellate Court. The judges in thiscourtareequllyuntrained, andhaveequally eccentric ideas, their orders have the force of legislative acts, and between the two the chances of acquittal for the guiltygreatly exceed those of punishment. Tlle result is umiversal laxity, and a belief, in what Carlyle woulcd call the " scoundrel-world," that punishment is allotted bv chance, that the probabilities are Ui favour of escape, and that in any case all crimes are equal in mag-,nitude. In civil proceedings the evil, though not so striking, is a great deal worse. The absence of fixed principles and a sound training renders the judges uncertain, contradictory, and, above all, slow. The cases decided are sometimes of enormous magnitude, suits involving the right to properties as large as Rutland or Salop. Imagine such suits intrusted to a bench of country justices, and you will form a good idea of the result attained. It is admitted that the judges, if they would use their own sense and knowledge of the people, would do indifferent good jUStice. B3ut they will not and cannot do this. They are fettered by a strict system of law,wshich yet they are not trained to administer. The magnitude of the evil has at last driven Government to resolve on some change, and an earnest discussion is going on as to the shape it ought to take. The radical plan is to import barristers. The officials, however, dread the introduction of men without knowledge of the language or the people. They incline rather to train the civilians. But, unfortunately, to set apart a number of civiliasu for judicial work is almost impossible. There are not enough men for the executive duties of the administration. Still the advocates of reform cling to this scheme. They would have a larger number of men brought out at any cost, and set them apart from the very first for judicial work. It is very certain that one of two things must be done. We must either have trained judges or revert to the ancient rule of deciding by common sense and good conscience. The present mongrel system answers no end. Between the tenures and the law courts no man in the interior can tell -whether his property is his own or not, and all enterprise is checked by the frightful profits necessary to compensate for the risk. The second point refers to a matter your English readers may be slow to comprehend. All the heavy demands upon Government, except for the payment of troops, fall upon the treasury of the Presidency. The6 bulk;of the interest of the debt is also paid there. The draughts for the home expenditure are paid there. All Mint transactions are settled there. It is therefore necessary to retain large sums in the Presidency treasuries-sometimes four or five millions. But a very small portion of the revenue is paid into them. It is collected in the far away interior, in the rice swamps of Dacca, and the rich wheat-fields of Mirzapore and the Doab. " Send it, then," an Englishman might remark. Thatis easy to say, but the transportation of a million sterling in rupees is a work of no smnall magnitude in acountry without railways, roads, or rapid means of transit. The transit of treasure from some stations occupies weeks and months, and is only effected under 3 guard of soldiers. The greatest care is necessary to tinme these remittances, and in March, 1855, the Treasury was in a state which was little short of banlkruptcy, and necessitated the public works loan. The object is to prevent such another catastrophe. The slow circulation of this currency, moreover, produces a systera of interal exchanges of the most absurd character. Imagine an exchange of 3 per cnt. between Edinburgh and London. Yet it exists betwee Calcutta and :irzapore, YwhiGh are no further apart. For UR Uhese reasonls th1e question of extending our paper ciurency or introduciut a gold currency begins to be seriously agitated. The latter has as yet the more powerful advocates, wvith Lord Dalhouie at their head, but the magnitude ofA the difficulty is not understood in England, and the innovation is strenaously resisted. (FoRM oUn oi- coIsroSPONDzNT.) BOMBAY, ArAr 28. On the north-west frontier all is perfectly tranqul. The Mahomedan fanatic who murdered MIr. George in the Kohat Pass has been tried at Feshawiar, found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged. The body after death is to be burnt to ashes, agreeably to the legislative provision in such cases, to which I have before alluded. According to the accounts that were ilrst current respecting the murder and the capture of the assassin, the two troopers who were escorting Mr. George behaved -with the utmost coolness and comuage. A liberal reward was about to be given to them by direction of Colonel Edwardes. But on the iiLal it turned out that their conduct had been the very reverse of what on thei. orn showing it had appeared to be. One did follow the murderer, and that for four miles, but at a respectful distance, and had no hand in his apprehension. The other made no show even of D)ursuing, but rode away to a foot police-station, assertng that his carbine was out of order. One of the policemen took his horse from him and rode away after the murderer, an act for which he has been rewarded and recommended for promotion, while, of the two troopers, the runaway has been sentenced to two years' imprisoniment with hard labour, and the other has been dismissed the service. Mlr. George received two shots, the first of which, fired close behind him from a ditch by the road-side, brought him from the saddle badly wounded. The second struck him in the breast and proved irnstantly fatal. At his trial the assassin, when called upon for his defence, refused to tell to infidels his own name, or that of his father, or of his native place. That he shot the Enaglishman and afterwards wounded two flindoo grooms he confessed, not freely only, buttriinnphantly. " They were all three Kafirs (infidels)" he said; "hewasaMSIussulmanand wishedto become a martvr." In so clear a case, and with a culprit at once so reticent and so communicative, there was, of course, no need to use many words, and if hanging and subsequent burning suffice to the attainment of his end, the wish of the Ghazee will be fulfilled. Put the execution of the sentence has not followed immediately upon its delivery, owing to the unavoidable delays to which IT referred in my last, when speaking of the desire which has been expressed that a swift and red-handed justice should be dealt to these mad fanatics. One of the most fornidable of the petty border rulers, Saadut Khan, the Momund Chief of Lalpcora, near Peshawur, against whom a force was very near being despatched a few months ago, has sent his son down to confer with the Chief Commissioner and make a permanent arrangement of affairs between hin and the Company. If he will only keep faithfully to suchterms as maybe agreed upon, he vill be useful to us in the pacification of the frontier, not in his individual person merely, but in those of a large variety of miinnows, -who are said invariably to follow the lead of this. their Triton. At present the stations of the Panjab Irregular Force are five in number-from Kohat on the north, nearest to Peshawur (where there is a large garrison of regulars), to Asnee on the south. Between these twvo points the whole country at the foot of the Suleiman range of mountains, which divide the Punjab from Affghanlistan, and are the home of the plundering border tribes, is patrolled daily by bodies of cavalry. So exposed are the stations, and so precarious the tranquillityof the countryaroundthem,that to two onlv out of the five-Dera Ghazee Khau andDera Ismail Khan-are English ladies permitted to acconnpany the troops. Annoyances of this kdnd no doubt tend to fortify an opinion which I have heard expressed, that the Indus, rather than the mountains beyond it, should have been fixed upon as our boundary in the north-west. As against a chivlized foe, doubtless the Suleiman range is a far more effective barrier than anyriver would be. But totheAfreedie tlibes, whose only mode of crossing water is that primitive one of the Assyrians in the British Mluseum-the inflated skin-the Indus -would present an obstacle behind which women and cattle would alike repose in a perfectiorn of security unattainable at the foot of the mountains. I mentioned in my last that it was the intention of the Government to send the Assaye steam-frigate, with a party of the 86th on board, to the MIalabar Coast in anticipation of an outbreak among the M1oplahs. The ship sailed accordingly, but the company of Enuropeans are, I believe, intended only to act on board, instead of the ordinary native mwarines, while the vessel is employed in distributing amonc the various gaols on the Coromandel Coast, w7ell away from the Mopish counltry, the parties under sentence of iunprisonment for complicity in the murder of lIr. Conolly. But among the co-religionists of the prisoners there appears good reason to anticipate the occurrence of some new outrage. A considerable party armed with their formidable knives have been seen lurking about in the neighbourhood of Calicut. rr. Collett, the magistrate, has received an anonymous letter warning him that an attempt wvas about to be made upon his life. N!to doubt all possible precautions will be taken, and we hope, though fearfully, that the excitement may have a bloodless t-rmination. The Moplahs, wvho, -when not under the influence of these fits of religious mania, exhibit many of the qualities of good citizens and useful members of the community, are of Arab descent. They now amounit to about 70,000 souls, among whom are found many of the wealthiest and most energetic traders of the district. An interesting pamphlet has lately been publihlied here by M:r. Bellasis, collector of Hyderabad, in Scinde, containing an account of his excavations and discoveries on the site of the ancient city of Brahiminabad, on a branch of the old bed of the Indus. Tradition affirms that the city-the capital of a Hindoo kingdom to which the tido of 3 lahomedan invasion had scarcely penetrated-was destroyed by fire from Heaven and by earthquake on account of the wickedness of its ruler. The investig,ations of MIr. BeDlasis seem to prove that the place realy was destroyed by some terrible convulsionof nature,which probably, at the same time, completely changed the courseof the indus. Onno other supposition eanaruinbe accountedforthat wasatonce so sudden and so complete. Skeletons were found hi everyr house that was opened and in the streets, some crouched tog,ether in corners, and there buried; others crushed flat by a falling weiglht, the pieces of stone or brick still in;some cases buried in the fractured skull. Numerous coins and other valuables have already been discovered, carved figures in ivory, engravings on cornelian and agate, a set of ivory chessmen, and the like. The figures carved on objects connected with religious worship are Buddhist. From the fact of their being uminutiliated, Mr. Bellais considers it clear that the iconoclastic MIussulman invaders had not reac'hed, or at least had not permanently annexed, Brahminabad at the time of its destruction, which he conceives to have taken place about A.D. 1020. The annual exhibition of the Elphinstone Insti- tuttion tookplace a few days ago, whenthe Governor presided, and the report was read by the Principal. lte principal feature in the regulation of the institution during the past year has been the nomination as exeaminers of gentlenen unconnected with the management. Ththertothe professos themselves have conducted the annual e-xaminations, and their reports have been for the most parthighly eulogistic. This year the estimate of the profciency of the students is in most respects considerably lower than the estimates of former years have been. When the reports of the exanminers-one of which-I have seen in manuscript-appear in print I shall probably have something to say about them. We are still getting on better than we antidipated in regard to -ater. Many of the poor have been induced to leave their homes and proceed to other parts of the island, where the researches of the Water Supply Committee have discovered water for them. Lord Elpninstone leaves for the hills to-morrow, to stay till the rains fall or are about to do so. Trade is in as satisfactory a state as iusual at this time of the year, when the advent of the monsoon is looked for.

A GOOD MazrOrY FOR GOOD DEEDs.-In the year 1854, a stranger lady, who was passing through Carlisle, naturally visited the cathedral, as a place of interest in our ancient city. After having seen everything of note, she handed a doltreuX to M1r. John Scott, the verger, for his attention, and departed. Mr. Scott did not at the time observe what he had received, but soon afterwards discovered it was a sovereign. Thinling there must be some mistake, he sought out the lady, and found her on the poinut of starting for London. The lady thanked him for his lionesty, and for the sovereign returned him a shilling, telling him that in her present circunstances she could not spare a larger sum. Mr. Scott heard nothing, nor did he ever expect to hear anything more, of the lady, till last weelk his recollection of the incident was revived by receiving a large handsomely bound Illustrated Family Bible, ¶vith:the following inscription in the donor's own handtviting:-" This sacred volume ispresented to John Scott, i1 remembrance of an act of his integrity, by a lady who visited the cathedral of Carlisle in 1854."'-CarZletc
LAW v REPOB P. COURT OF CHANCERY, coLn's-N-,. MAY 31. IIARRISON V. GUEST. (JieJore Mne LORD UHMANCELLOP-) This appeal, which sought to set aside a conveyance made by an old man to the defendant, w. as argued before his Lordship last week and reported in The lTimes. The consideration for the property, a small copyhold estate, was that the lefendant should maintain the vendor during the remainder of his life. The vendor died shortly after the execution of theconveyance, and the plaintiffso, who claimed through him, filed their bill to set aside the transaction on the ground of fraud, namely, by reason of the imbecility of the vendor and the inadequacy of the consideration. HisLFordship gave a conditional judgmnent on Saturday last, dismissing the bill, but at the same time stated that he should wish to have an opportunity of looking again through the judgment of the Court below before finally disposing of the case. The LORD CHANCELLOR this morning said that he had very carefully read through the papers and the Vice-Chancellor's Judgment, and saw no reason to alter his decision of last week. There was no fiduciary character whatever existing between the vendor and purchaser* and it also appeared that the vendor knew perfectly well what he was about at the time of the sale. T'he evidence proved that he considered the bargain avery beneficial one, and that he was detenmned not to part with his property except upon the terms of a suintenance in lieu of money. There was no imposition in the transaction, nor any other feature in it that could justify the Court in setting it aside. The bill must be dismissed. IN BE TOLSON'S PATE?T. This was a petition to have the great seal affixed to letters patent for an improved method of producing a metallic iustre on cloth, &c. The application was opposed by two persons named Schischkar and Calvert, who in January, 1854, obtained a patent which they alleged comprehended the one now sought for by the petitioners. On the other side it was contended that Schischkar and Calvert had no locus standi in this court, inasmuch as they had already unsuccessfully opposed the invention before the SolicitorGeneral through a person named Barlow. A great number of affidavits pro and con. were read. Mr. Bagshawe, Q.C., and Mr. Hindmarch (of the common law bar), appeared in support of the petition; Mr. Webster (of the comnmon law bar) opposed it. The LOrD CHANCELLOR said, he saw no reason to refuse the sealing of the letters patent, as the legal rights of the parties wouild not be affected thereby. The question whether the invention now claimed was inciuded in the letters patent of Schischkar and Calvert was one for the determination of a court of law, and therefore the order would go for the sealing of the petitioners' patent. The following appeals have been transferred from the paper of the Lords Justices to that of the Lord Chancellor :-Farina v. Silverlock-Collins v. Cane-Selwyn v. Smith-Roddam v. Morley.
ROLLS-COURT, CnAxoEy-LMNE. AAY 37 T5- RVT. 'rTT -nRT'IT .R- -A[{Or% .-- (Before t7Le MASTER of the RoLes.) His HONOUR, in giving judgment in this case, expressed his regret that a company which had been formed for so excellent a puese as finding employment for the poor of Norwich should have been so injudiciously managed that, after the expenditnre of all its available capital and the contraction of a large debt, it was still compelled to come to this Court to be wound up, and have the relative contribution of its directors and shareholders declared. The company was formed in the month of August, 1834, with a capital of 30,0001., and the object of the company was stated by its deed to be " the teaching the poor of Norvich how to spin wool into yarn." The company was carried on w%ith varied success for 16 years, but in the year 1851 camc to an end, having expended all its paid-up capital and incurred a debt of 12,0001. to its bankers. *hen the operations of the company ceased, the property belonging to It was sold, and realized 17,0001. Oat of this sum the bankers claimed to be paid, but upon a suit being conimenced by them their claim against this specific sum was disallowed. The bankers then gave up proceeding against the company, to make their claim personally against the directors of it, and these gentlemen eventually either paid, or allowed themselves to be made liable to pay, the debt due to their bankers. Having assumed this responsibility, the directors applied to this Court to make the shareholders jointly liable with themselves to discharge the banikers' claim. The Master, to wvhom the case was referred, refuised to make an order to that effect, bat gave the directors authority to apply 12,000?. out of the 17,0001. which the cosnpany's property realized, for the payment of tle banker. To this order both the directors and the shareholders took objection, and the case now came before this Court to decide as to relative liabilities of the parties. His Honour held that the shareholders were equally liable, in proportion to their shares with the directors for the bond fidc debts of the company, and that the directors had been guilty of no fraud or wilful mismanagement, as alleged, that would give shareholders exemption from such liability. The directors also were entitled to be repaid any money they had personally paid to the bankers, and an order must be made to that effect.

This was a petition, praying that the assignees of Sir Joln Dean Paul might be ordered to transfer to the present trustees of the marriage settlement of Mr. and Mrs. Bankhead, a policy of assurance for 2,GOOI., effected by Sir John Dean Paul upon his own life in the Rock Assurance-office. The circumstances wvere as follows:-Sir John Dean Paul was surviving( trustee of the settlement made upon the marriage of his sister with M11r. Bankhead, and dated the 14th of December, 1825. He had received a considerable amount of property as trustee, and had omitted to invest a sum of 4,0001. This sum had been retained in his hands, and interest at 4 per cent. paid upon it. In August, 1848, Sir J. D. Paul put into a tin box at the bank, marked "Bankhead's Trust," and in which the marriage settlement and securities upon which the property subject thereto had been invested were kept, two policies of assurance, one upon his own life in the Rock-office for 2,000!., and the other upon the life of his father for 3,0001., which had been assigned to him. He also placed the folow;ing memorandum in the box - "Temple-bar, August 26, 1848. "In the event of my death the amount of the enclosed policies of insurance for 3,0001. and 2,0001., to be applied respectively to the repayment of 4,000l. borrowed by me of Mrs. Bankhead at 41. per cent. 3. D. PAUL." Upon the death of Sir J. D. Paul, the father, the 3,000 . upon the poicyupon his life was received by Sir J. D. Paul, the bankrupt, but had not been applied in discharge of the 4,000!. due to Mrs. Bankhead, whicis still remained owing upon the bankruptoy in June, 1855. New trustees of the settlement had been subsequently appointed, and it was sought by the present petition, which was presented by Mr. Bank-head, to recover from the assignees of Sir J. D. Paul the poNcy for 2,000!. SIr. ROLT and Mr. W. D. LEvwS, in support of the petiton, contended that the pohcy of assurance must be treated as subject to the trusts of the settlement, and not as forming any part of the bankrupt's estate. The " order and disposition" clame, in the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Aet, 1849, had no application, as Sir J. D. Paul was for al external purposes both the legal and reputed owner of this policy, and consequently notice to the insurance office or any other party was unnecessary. The same point had been decided in a case arising out of the same bankruptcy of "E xparte Greaves," reported in the WVeekly Report-r for 1856, P. 536. Mr. Daniel appeared for the trustees. Mr. CHANDLESS, for the assignees, contended that the poiey was property in the order and disposition of the ankrupt, and had effectualy passed to the assignees. The \TicE ChLsUcELLoRt, without calling for a reply, said that the only question in the case appeared to have been decided by the case of "Ex .parte Greaves," before the Lords Justices. If a declaration of trust -was made by a sole trustee, then he was the proper person to be in possession of the property, and any payment made to him would be proper. Sir J. D. Paul was the true owner ofithis poliy, and the question of reputed ownership did not arise, and the property was affected with the trust when the bankruptcy took place. The form of the memorandum was peculiar, but he had no doubt that it was meant to declare an inunediate trust, and could not be considered as an imperfect testamentary paper. If it had referred only to the policy on his owvn life no question could have arisen from the words, "in the event of my death." It could only mean that he was a trustee, and that when the money was payable-nz., at lis death, it was to be applied in a particular way. Rather more difficulty arose from the memorandum referring also to a policy upon the life of the father which would become payable at a diferent time; but stiU he entertained no donbt that it was meant to create, and did create, an immediate trust, and, therefore, the policy must be transferred to the new trustees according to the prayer of the petition. IN THE MAATTER. OF THE .WARKWORTH DOCK COM.PAuY, AND OF TLE JOLNT-STOCK COMPASSES VNLLW-NG-Up ACTS. This was a petition praying for a winding-up order in reference to this company, presentedl by a Mr. (Mover, who was being sued by the Royal British Bank for 1,053w, alleged to ave been advanced for the use of the company, and to which action the petitioner had no legal defence. Hie sought, therefore, to have the company wound up, and to get contribution from the other parties liable. Mr. T. H. Terrel appeared in support of the petition. Mr. W. M. JAMES and M1r. BOYLE for Lord Grey and MIr. Ladbroke, opposed the petition, which they observed was about as impudent a petition as had ever been presented. The petitioner, who bad not stated the real facts in his petition, was being sued for a debt which was due from himself and four other persons individualy, who had agreed to pay all the expenses if their attempt to get up the company should fail; moreover, at the resent time there was no company in existence which could be wound up. The VICE-CHAxCELLOz. said, that the petition had hardly been too strongly characterized by the counsel for the respondents. The facts were these:-There had been an attempt to form a company, which had in some degree proved abortive, and the Warkworth Dock Act, passed in 1852, had been allowed to remain dormant for two years when the Ptitioner and four other persons applied t&Lord Grey and . Ladbroke, who were owners of property in the neighbourhood, and had obtained the act, and were di. rectors in the company. It was understood and arranged (and he thought that there was a ver distinct averment of an agreement to this effect) that these persons, who ap. plied to Lord Grey and Mr. Ladbroke, should take means for getting up a list of efficient shareholders so as to carry out the project, and that, if the attempt failed, they would bear all te expense themselves. The result was that the attempt did fail, as only eight persons took up shares, and only 58!. was paid up. A meeting was held for the purpose of seeing what could be done, at which Lord Gfey and Mfr. Ladbroke agreed to pay 25 per cent, upon the sharcs held by them, and the petitioner and the other four persons who hiad entered into the arrangement, not finding it convenient to pay up money, signed a promissory note, upon which they were now being sued. Lord Grey and Mr. Ladhroke had made a further payment amounting to 351. upon their shares in the whole, and their affidavit, which had remained uncontradicted stated that if the others had paid what they had agreed there wouldba funds enough to meet all the expenses incurred. It was by xo means a case for granting aorder, and upon a petition so presented, which did not contain any true statement of the facts of the case, it was quite fair that it should be dismissed with costs.

COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH. WEs'mns=. mAY 3L TIIE QUEEN V. TH1E CHURCHIWAXRDEWS OF ST. MICIAIAIS, SOlrT1TAWUTAN (Sittings in Banco, before dlr. Justice ERLE and Mr. Justice (cnn--n,r ) This casecamebefore theCourt upon ademurrertoa return to a niandanuts. The question aised waswhetherthe defendants, who were the churchwardens of Southampton, could be compelled by mandamus to pay to the prosecutors certain sums of money due upon certain bonds. The bonds in question were given many years ago by the then churchwardens in respect of money expended in enlarging and epairmig the parish church of St. Michael, Southamapton. The 59th section of the 58th of George ml., chap. 45, empowered clhurchwardens to borrow on the credit of the rates such sums as should be necessary to defray the expense of enlarging any parish church, and to make rates for the payment of the interest and principal at such time and in such manner as should be agreed upon by the lenders. The facts stated in the return raised the questions now at issue between the parties. It was alleged, in the first place, that the bonds in question had not been given, as required by the act, to secure the payment of money to be raised and expended in fitturo ; but to secure money already expended, which could not be legally done.. Secondly, it was alleged the prosecutors had been g,uilty of laches in allowing the interest to faU into arrear, and could not now enforce payment from the present churchwardens. Air. AL Smith, QC. (with whom was Mr. Archibald) supported the demurrer; and Mr. H. Hil, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Barstow) the return. At the conclusion of the argunment. Mr. Justice CnRO'IPTON said, the Court would take time to consider. BAIL COURT. (Smlting: at Nisi Prius, before Mr. JbtsticC WIGHTMA.X and o07n7zon Jurics.) BECI;ETT AND OTHERS V. TILLOTSON. Mfr. Knowles and Mr. Bailey were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. H. Hill, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Quain, for the defendant. This action was brought to recover the amount of a bill of exchange for 50l. alleged to have been accepted by the defendant, a machine-maker at Bradford; the plaintiffs are hankers at Leeds, and the bil, which vwas drawn and endorsed by 31essrs. Onions, Cliff. and Co., had come into their hands in the usual course of business. The defendant pleaded that the acceptance was a forgery. To prove the acceptance James Omons and James Cliff who had carried on business as ironfounders at Bradford, under the name of " Onions, Cliff, and Co.," from November, 1854, until February, 1856, when they failed, were caled; they stated that on the 2.5th of December, 1855, they went to the defendant's office and asked him to go wvith them to the Acorn Inn; when there they asked him to accept a bill for their accommodation; he consented, and Oliff; who had a stamp ready in his pocket, filled up the bill and the defendant accepted it; they owed bin 161 at the time; he was pressing them for the amount and they promised to pay hiln out of the proceeds of the bill Mlr. Breer, the landlord of the inn, stated that Onions, Cliff, and the defendant wNere at his house on the day in question. They caUed for pen, ink, and paper, which he took into the room. Onions wrote down their names for a supper that was to take place the same night. Neither of the others wvrote anything, and he brought the pen, ink, and paper out of the room with him. Mr. HAM1-iKINs having addressed the jury, The defendant was called. He admitted having been at the Acorn with Cliff and Onions. He had gone out with them, as they stated thley expected to receive some money out of whichl they would pay his account, but he denied positively that then, or at any other time, he had accepted a bil for them. Mr. KNOWLES said that, after the conflict of testimony, he would siot feel justified in going to the jury vithout making fn-ther inquiries. He would therefore consent to be nonsuited. His LORVDSHIr considered he had exercised a wise discretion. The plaintiffs were accordingly nonsuited. _ARCIWEATCON V. TODE. This was an action for libel; the declaration alleged special damage; the defendant pleaded "Not guilty," and a justifLeation. Mr. Hawkins was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. M3 Chambers and Mr. Holl for the defendant. Mr. HLN;i_Ns stated that the plaintiff was an adverising agent and proprietor of a twopenny paper-the Builider2 lgete-ly Beporlto The defendant Todd WaS one of the registered proprietors of the Land anzd Building Necws, but the real defendant was Mr. KeUy, the principal proprietor of it; the defendant had been in his employment, but left in the early part of this year; on the 10th of Mlarch he punb]ishedthe first number of his paper; on the 17th the following paranraph appeared in the first page of dtefendant's paper:- " To our Readers and Advertisers. On and after the 31st of May the Building NewcS Will be putblished weekly, but no alteration will be made in size or price. "Mr. Creagh Archdeacon, the late advertisement collector of the Building Neews, was discharged for misapplying the money of the plroprietors. Mr. Creagh Archdeacon was no independent advertisement agent, but a paid servant, receiving a salary of 27's. a-week.' Copies of the paper containing this paragraph were sent to several of the plaintiff's customers, it was clearly libelous, but the only object of the plaintiff was to vindicate hris character. After some conversation among the counsel, it was arranged that a juror should be withdrawn, the defendant disclaiming any imputation against the plaintiff's character.
COURT FOR THE CONSIERATION OF CROWK CASES RESRRVh 9TIuRPTAV- May 21 THkE QUEEN V. BENJAUMIN SCOTT. PreseCnt-Lord CA-nPBELL, and JustiCecs COLERIDGE and ICRESSWELL, and Baronis ALLDERSON antd BP.DINVELL. Mr. Campbell appeared for the prisoner, wlho had been convicted of nuitilatinghis books, he being a bankrupt. On, the trial the principal evidence against the prisoner was his examination before the Commissioner under his bankruptcy. The prisoner was tried before Mr. Justice Wiles, who reserved the question whether that examination was Teceivable. The learned COUS-SEL now contended that that examination was not receivable, on three grounds-first, that the examination, being taken under a declaration, was equivalent to an examination upon oath; secondly, the evi' dence was not receivable, because it was extorted frorm him by threats from one in authority, and during the time the prisoner was under duress; and, thirdly, the evidence was not receivable, on the ground that the bankrupt wai bound to answer all questions put to him. Lord CAMPrELs. said, if the prisoner had not aniswered the questions he mnight have been sent to prison, because in the Bankruptcy Court a bankrupt was bound to answer all questions put to Mm-but the case of " Garbett" contained all the matter upon this subject. Mr. FOSTER further contended that the indictment did not show that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction, inasmuch as it was necessarv by the 17th and 18th of Victoria that the bank-pt should have resided in the district for six months next before the declaration of insolvency was filed, and this the indictment did not stats. Mr. OVERESmD was heard for the prosecution. The CornT postponed its judgment.
COURT OF COMON PFLEAS, WEsomiStE, M AY 3L ITARMTAN V REED. (Siltzvns i1Z Banro. TTrinih/ Tcrm.) This was an action tried at LNorwich before Lord Chief Justice Jervis, and was brought to recover the amount of 301. agreed by the defendant tobe given to the plaintiff for a mare and foal, and six weeks' agistment of that mare and foal, and also of another mare and foal.. At the trial it was objected that this was a contract for the sale of goods and cbattels to a greater value than 101., and was therefore within the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds, and could not be enforced, as the contract was not in writing, and the defendant had refused to accept the mare and foal and had paid nothing to bind the bargain. The objection was held good and the plaintiff nonsuited, with leave reserved to move to set aside the nonsuit. A rule to set aside the nonsuit having been obtained on a former day, Mr. Serjeant Byles appeared to show cause against the rule, and Mir. O'MaUey, Q.C., and MIr. Couch in support of it. It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that part of the consideration for the 301. was the grass to be eaten by the two mares and foals. That, as to the grass eaten by the defendant's mare and foal, that had been delivered and accepted by the defendant, and was on the ribs of his mare and foal. It was also contended that no price was set upon the mare and foal, and their value might be assumed to be under 10!., and the rest of the 301. be for the agistment. The COURT were of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged and the nonsuit to stand. The contract was for goods above the value of 10!., and was within the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds, and that there had been no acceptance by the defendant. The Court, however, intimated an opnion thatthe plaintiff might recover for the agistment Rule discharged.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER) MLY 31. M7dUNCEY V. D]XNNTS-Tl..M3TF'P.W t;siting in Banco.) The CmHsi BARoN to-day delivered the judgment of the Court in this case, which was argned on the bst day of Easter Term by Mr. Couch for the plaintiff and Mr. Keene for the defendant. This was a rule for a new trial, on the ground that the Under-Sheriff of Cambridgeshire had improperly admitted evidence of the custom of the country in support of the plaintiff in an action to recover the value of certain straw left by him on a farm at the expiration of his lease of a farm in which he was succeeded by the defendant, the objection being that such evidence was inconsistent with the terms of the agreement, which bound. the tenant to consume with stock all the hay, straw, and clover on the farm, and use all the manure thereon. The plaintiff contended that this clause applied only to the period of the term, and made provision as to what was to be done after its exzpiration, and that in such a case the custom of the country as to outgoing and incomng tenants was applicable, and therefore admissible. In this view of the case the Court fully agreed, as otherwise the consequence would be that the tenant would be bound to consume the last stalk of straw on the last moment of the lease, or be a trespa6ser. Under these circumstances, the rule for a new trial must be discharged. Judgment accordingly.
CENTBAL RILAL, COURT, May 3L OLa) COIJRT. (Before the RECORDEP..) At the opening of the court Peter Francis Mogan, the Post-office letter-sorter, who was convicted on Friday of steang a letter containing a sovereign, was brought up for judgment. The RECORDER, in passing sentence, said that the prisoner had been convicted of a very serious offence, and he was afraid there was too much reason to believe, from the fact of eight letters having been found shortly before the transaction in question torn up, and also the large decrease in the number of complaints since he had been in custody, that he had been carrying on these practices for a considerable time. He had, however, it appeared, been in the service of the Post-office for 20 years, and, no doubt, at one time deserved the confidence that had been reposed in him; and the jury upon this ground had recommended him to mercy. But for this he should have felt it his duty toorder him to be transported, and, although he should not go to that extent, yet he must still pass a severe sentence-that of penal servitude forsix years. John Markham, 24, a well-dressed respectable-looking young nman, was indicted for forging and uttering an order for the payment of 91t., with intent to defraud Messrs Smith, layne, and Smith, the bankers. Mr. Sleigh and Mr. Poiand conducted the prosecution; Mr. Ballantine was counsel for the prisoner. The learned counsel for the prosecution, on opening the case, described it as one of a peculiar and unusual character, and he said the jury would entertain no doubt, when they heard the factsr, that a most ingenious and artful fraud had been committed, and that the only question would be, whether the prisoner was the guilty party. He then called the following witnesses:- Mr. C. F. Ash deposed that he carried on the business of an oven merchant in Upper Thames-street. In the beginning of the month of February last his premises were broken open and a good deal of property stolen. Among other things that were ta-en two blank checks were cut out of his check book. The check for 911., now produced, was a forgery, and he believed it was drawn upon one of the checks that were stolen on the night of the burglary. By Mr. BALL4-TS-E.-He knew nothing whatever of the prisoner. In answer to a question put by the ItECORDER, the witness said that the signature to the check was a good imitation of his genuine signature. Some bills and other papers on which his name was written were taken away on the night of the robbery, and he supposed this had afforded an opportunity to copy his signature. A young man named Humphreys was then examined, mid he stated that on the 15th of February he put an advertisement for a situation in 1iet Times, and a day or two afterwards he received a letter requesting him to call upon a Mr. Hammond, at No. 6, Oakley-crescent, City-road, and he went there and saw the prisoner. Having made some inquiries of him, he said that he was engaged in business at Oxford and London, and that he was continually backwards and forwards, and that he should want him to drive and look after a horse and chaise, and he also told him he should wvant himu to live at Oxford. Witness objected to this, and said he did not think the situation would suit him, and the prisoner asked him to consider of it until the following morning, and, if he still declined, he should be glad if he would execute two or three little commissions for him. He went the next morning accordingly, and told the prisoner that the place would not suit him, and the prisoner then asked him to go to the Euston-square station and ask for Mr. Hammond's luggage. He went as he was directed, but no such luggage was there, and upon his return the prisoner expressed his surprise that his luggage had not arrived, and then handed him a check for 911. upon Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co. He went to the bankwith the check and presented it, but the cashier did not pay it, and he was t-en into a back office, where he was questioned, and in consequence of what he said he was taken to the office of Mr. Mulleus, the solicitor. He subsequently went to the house in Oakley-crescent, accompanied by John Forrester, the officer. but the prisoner ihad gone away. This witness was cross-examined at considerable length by MIr. BALLAZTINE, with a view to show that he was mistaken in his identity.-He said that he did not see hin again until the beginning of March, when he was in custody. He was taken to the House of Detention, where the prisoner was under remiand, and shown a number of prisoners in different cells, and among them the prisoner; but he did not recognise him until he was told that he had passed the man he was expected to identify, and he then said the prisoner was like the man who had given him the forged check. He saw him afterwards at Marlborough-street Police-court, and he then was certain he was the same mian. Mss Adelaide Fennell, the landlady of the house in Oakley-crescent, deposed that a man, whom she believed to be the prisoner, engaged her apartments about the 20th of February. He told her that he had some business to transact in London, and he should want the apartments for two or three weeks. He only remained a day or two, and left without any notice. In answer to questions put to her this witness said that the man had black patches in different parts of his face and wore spectacles, so that his features could not be seen very readily, but she had no doubt the prisoner was the same person. She admitted that, in the first instance, when she was questionled upon the subject, she expressed a doubt whether the prisoner was the same man, but she said the reason for doing so was that she did not desire to appear as a witness. Evidence was then given that on the 8th of Marcl a young man named Bowles advertised for a situation, and received an answer dated from 16, Stanhope-street, Regents' Park, and signed "E. Bates," requesting hin to call upon him He went accordingly, and saw a man whom he stated to be the prisoner, and he was requested by him, as in the former case, to go to the railway station to inquire for luggage, and then he gave him a check for 871. 14s. upon Messrs. Ransom and Co., Pall-mall, and told him to get four 101.-notes and 471. in gold. He went to the bank and received the money, and took it back to the prisoner, who made an appointment for hiim to come on the following day. He shortly afterwards, however, received a letter from the prisoner, stating that he was obliged to go out of town, and he would write to him when lie required his services. This excited Bowles's suspicions, and he communicated with the bankers, and the forgery was then discovered. He saw nothing of the prisoner until the 19th of March, when he met him walking with another man in Oxford-street, and when the prisoner observed him he turned his head away. Bowles, however, went up to him and asked him if his name was not Bates, and he said it was not, his name was Hawkins, and he and his companion walk-ed away. Bowles continued following them, but before he could meet with a policeman they succeeded in getting away. He met the prisoner again a few days afterwards, near the Edgware-road, and he then gave the prisoner into custody upon the charge of uittering a forged check. He first gave the name of Jobn Hawkins, but afterwards he said that Isis name was Markbam, and that he lived in Chapel-street, Pentonville. The prisoner, it appeared, became very violent, and attempted to strike the young man Bowvles. He was then taken to the house in Stanhope-atreet, and upon the servant seeing him she said that, if he w as not the man who had taken the lodging in the name of Bates, he was Ihis brother, and the prisoner upon this renewed his violence, and so alarmed the girl that she fainted away, and the officer who had him in custody was obliged to threaten that he wrould call in the assistance of other constables, before the prisoner could be at all quieted. A gentleman from the establishment of Mlessrs. Bramah and Co., whose name appeared on the check, proved that the sig nature was a forgery. He added that it was a most excellent hmitation of the genuine signature of the finnm but he had not the slightest idea how an opportunity had been obtained to copy it or how the blank cheeks had been obtained possession of. -Mr. BAtLSArrcs E, at the close of the case for the prosecution, addressed the jury for the defence, and contended that they would not be justified upon the evidence before them in finding that the prisoner was the man who had sent the forged checks ; and that the evidence as to his identity was not to be relied upon. The RECOR.DER then s;ummed up, and jThe Jury, without any hesitation, found the prisoner Guilty. W illiamn Attwell, 25, who had been indicted wvith Markham, was then arraiged upon a charge of uttering a forged check for 71l. lOs. Mlr. M'Bnteer defended the prisoner; the same counsel were engaged for the prosecution as in tle former case. The manner in which this charge was sought to be brought home to the prisoner was by proving that he had changed the whole of the four lOl-notes that were the produce of the 87 forged check, giving a false name. The RECORDER, however, said that, although the conduct of the prisoner was auspicious, le did not think upon such evtidee the jury weuld be justidied in convicting the The jury, therefore, under his Lordship's direction, retunmed a verdict of Not Guilty. His at Ssr then ordered the other prisoner, Markham, to be placed at the bar, and inquired If anythingd was known of him ? hr. Muliens said, it had been ascertained that he was a wellknowin "skittle sharp," as it was termed, and, although he had never before been charged with an offence of this kind, he was known to be the associate of "nmagmen" and bad characters. The RECORDER then sentenced the prisoner to bekept in penal servitude for four years. NEW COURT. (Before the Commose SEabJEaNT.) Ferdinand lenden, 52, teacher, was indicted for obtaining by false pretences from Henry Pearson Maples the sum of 101. Mfr. Robinson prosecuted and Mr. Lilley defended. It appeared from tlhe evidenca that the prisoner, who is a teacher of languages, arrived soene time since in this country, through Dieppe, Newhaven, and by the London and Brighton Railway. Shortly after his arrival he made application to the company for compensation for a carpet bag and contents, the value of which he alleged was 191. 10s., stating that it had been lost during its conveyance to London by the company. The company, upon the instructions which he gave, made inquiry, and found that he had brought a carpet hag with him to this country fro-n l'aris, andthat it had a rintednumber, "28," affixed+tothe bottom of it. The bag, however, could not be found; and after some further communication upon the subject the company, throMgh Mr. Maples, gave the prisoner 101. as compensation for the allged loss. From something which afterwards transpired, Carpenter, the inspector upon the Brighton Railway, made a search for the prisoner} and found that he had left some luggage at a beershop in-King William-street, London-bridge. Carpenter watched some days, and fnally the prisoner sending some one after the luggage, Carpenter followed, and so found the prisoner. ALmongst the things at the beershop Was a carpet bagt with the figures "28" upon the bottom of it. A diary dan some papers found npon the prnsoner establshed beyond doubt ghe fraud he had committed. Re was found Guilty, and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. TBIRD COURT. (Before .31r. 2PREsDERGAST, Q.C.) }Henry Charneli, 31, John Sale, 58, W*ilim Martin, 34, Charles Peshell, 35, and John Tillett, all described as servant-, were indicted for stealing a quantity of plate, svaiued a1t 5001., the property of Richard W. Trott F?isher, the master of Charnel. M1r. Giffard prosecuted; Mr. 3rEnteer, Mr. Parry, and Mr. Cooper were for the prisoners. The case, -which lasted from the sitting of the Court until late in the evening, was one of a peculiar and complicated character.- The prosecutor is a gentleman, living a..o. 30, Eaton-place, and CharneU had been for some time his butler, having in his entire care the plate, which used to be kept in a closet in the butler's pantry, the keys of which, with those of the pantry, the prisoner Charnell always kept. 'Jpon the morning of the 5th of April, at about 7 o'clock in the morning, Charnell sent up to his master to say that he wanted to speak with him, and upon Mr. Fisher going down he found Charnel in a very alarmed and excited state; and Charnell said that after his master had gone to bed he (Charnell) had been called out to see a sick cousin, and that upon his return home at 4 o'clock he found that his pantry had been broken into and the plate, with the exception of some few articles, taken. Mfr. Fisher upon this sent for the police, to whom Charnell told the same story, gi ing the address of the cousin who he said had sent for him. The police then inspected the pantry and closet, and found some slight marks, but not enough to warrant a conclusion that there had been any forcible breaking. Some short time after the police had left CharneU went again to his master, and said that what he had said about his cousin was not true. Ee then stated, that he had been out upon the previous night with the other prisoners that they had intended to go to a ball, but that when they got there it was not to take place and that theythenwent about fr-om one publichouse to another, and that when he came home he found out the robbery, and that he then went to where Martinlived and wrote a letter to a m Gilbert, of 37, Somerset-street, Portman-square, telling her what had happened, and asking her to pass for his cousin, and say that she had been taken ill and had sent for him. She said it was useless for him to conceal the real truth. He then went on to say that Martin and Peshell-who are servants out of place, living in Princesrow-had called upon him on the day before the robbery, and asked [him to -o with them to a baU at Willis's Rooms, Brewer-street, Golden-square, and that he had written to Tillett (who was in service at No. 80, Westbourne-terrace) to come with them, and Martin posted the letter; that in the evening they all came and were in his pantry. where they waited until he (Mr. Fisher) had gone to bed, and they thenwentouttogether, Charnelllocldnguptheplace; andthat when he came home and found what had occurred he looked about for the police, but could not see anyone. The prosecutor'sfemale servant had seen some of the other prisoners with Charnel in the pantry upon the night previously to the robbery. The plice, upon questioning the other prisoners, received from them statements which slightly differed from Charnell's. The most singalar part of it was that the letter which Charnel said Ile had sent upon the 4th of April to Tillett, upon being obtained, was found to bear the postmark "March 22." None of the plate had been found, or even heard of. All the prisoners bore extremely good characters. Mr. M'ENvnTER most ably contended that Charnell was only shown to be negligent in his duty; and Mr. PARRY and 'r. COOPER said that against their clents the case -was but suspicion. The jury Acq itted all the prisoners. This ended the business of the session.
POLICE. M&xsIOx-nOIUSE.-James Mines wascharged withrobbing his employer, Mr. F. G. Aumonier, 163, Leadenhall-street, silversmith. The prosecutor deposed that tho prisoner had been for some time in his employment, as silver polisher, up to Taesday, the 20th nlt., upon which day he was absent from illness, and prosecutor missed a gold watch which had been left -by a gentleman for repair, and placed in a room to which only the prisoner had access. Having his suspicion thus excited, prosecutor looked into his stock, and found that a parge quantity of silver plate was gone, upon which he called mn the police, by whose aid a considerable portion of the missing property had been found at the shops of various pawnbrokers. Among other thin's so found was the watch, to which was attached an Albert chain, and which had been taken from his stock. The prosecutor identiaied certain articles produced .-s being hispret'rty, andthe prisoner was remanded, that more John Mackenzie, charged with robbing his employers, Messrs. M'Andrew and Co., Allhallows'-chainbers, Fenchurch-street, was brought up for final examination. Mr. Mullms appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Binns for the defence. Upon previous examinations it had been deposed that the prisoner had embezzled the sum of 2081. out of moneys entrusted to him by his employers for the purpose of defrayng petty cash expenses, out of which amount S91. was a balance from last year, whEich the prisoner had not brought forward on his hooks, the rest of the money charged to have been stolen having been kept back by himn in a similar manner between the 1st of January and the end of April last. Mr. Binns now cross-examined Mr. Baker, of the firm prosecuting, with a view to showing that the cash-box in whichthe prisoner had kept the money was continually liable to he gone to by other clerks, but without wisling to impugn their honesty, but withont proving anything materiel in favour of the prisoner. 31r. Mulins submitted that the question was one of law as to w;hether the prisoner could be charged with stealing the balance of 208I., of whichhe was deficient when his accounts were examied. Formerly, money given by a master for any purpose to one ins employ, and misappropriated in a general balance, could only he treated as a breach of trnst, and not as a felony, upon the grounds that no specific charge could be made of stealing any specific description of coin or bank notes, but, by Lord Campbell's act, the law was altered, and it was now quite sufficient on such a case, to charge a person with stealing generaly, without any speific description whatever. Besides, the concealment of the fact bytthe had S left as a balance at the end an act of stealing, while a subsequent application for 30L, upon the ground that he held no balance, was an allegation of false pretences. The prisoner was commnitted for trial. The LORD MAYon, upon a case of drunkenness coming before himn, took occasion to express the great delight vwhich he felt at the most gratifying manner in which the peace celebration passed over on Thursday night. He had gone with the crowvd to view the illumiubtions, for the purpose of conincing himself of the orderly conduct of thepeople and he had never in his life beheld a vast concourse of people in which so little tumult, confusion, or annoyance prevailed. Everywhere there seemed to be a general desire to exhibit courtesy and good will one to another; and people of all classes conbined to show with howlittle parade of authority on such occasions the people of the great metropolis might be ruled. In addition, as a magistrate, it was to him most pleasing to reflect that no single case of disorderly conduct, arising out of the illuminations, had been brouglht into that court. The LounD MYOR requests the press to acknowlodge the receipt of 21. 2s. from Lawrence Levey; 10s. from " C. G. F. ;" and 5l. 5s. from the Union Club, for the poorbox. BoVw-sTREZs.-Charles Roberson, Henry Wade, and Laurence Doyle, alleged to be members of a gang of dogstealers, were brought before Mr. HENRY, having been several timaes remanded, on charges arising firom a negotiation for the restoration of a valuable Newfoundland dog, stolen from Mr. Latty, a gentleman of property, residing in Glocester-gardens, Bayswater. On the 9th of April, being about a fortnight after the loss of the dog, Roberson called on lMr. Latty, saying that he came from the man who had " found" the dog, and proposing to restore it for a consideration of two guineas. In the course of conversation he observed that he could steal any dog he liked, as often as he liked. Mr. natty replied that this was a poor inducement to him to pay two guineas for the restoration. However, if it were really his dog, ihe was wiling to give some remuneration, on condition that the amount should be left to his discretion. He would send his groom, Thomas Mills, with the prisoner, to see the dog. He proposed that apoliceman should accompany them. Roberson at first objected, saying, "If you bring the police into it you shall never see your dog ;" but ultimately he agreed, and Mlorgan, 275 D, was caled in. Having obtained his inspector's permission, MNorgan went, in private clothes, with Mills and Roberson, to a publichouse called the Sugarloaf, kept by a man named Williams in King-street, Drury-lane, a known resort of dog-stealers. There they found Wade, Doylc, and some others, but no man with a dog. In the momentary absence of Mlls the three prisoners and two of their companions made a savage attack on the Policeman, who was fearfully beaten, kicked, and wounded in the head wvith a pewter pot. Mils, on coming to his aid, was also roughly handled, though not so seriously injured. The men escaped, and M1organ was conveyed to the hospital, where he lay in a dangerous condition for weeks. On the 16th of May the prosecutor met R oberson in the street and gave him into custody, when a quantity of liver cut in smaUl slices, a sheep's tail, and a cord with a noose were taken from his pockets. Wade and Doyle were subsequently apprehended, the former at the Sugarloaf. It was acknowledged by Williams, the landlord, that the house was frequented by dog-fanciers,, and that appointments were often made thiere to give up dogs. He knew Wade and Doyle as associates of the dogfanciers, but not as being concerned in these transactions. Roberson denied th.at he was concerned in stealing the dog, or knew what had become of it, and said that he had left before the assault wvas commnitted, being afraid of getting into trouble. Doyle and White said, they were working-men, and had no connexlon wiith the dog-fanciers or with thlis transaction. They were not present at the assault. Mr. Hzoi sentenced Itoberson to six months' imprisOnment for being concerned in stealing the dog. As MIorgan could not be said to be in the ex;ecution of his duty, he treated the attack on him as an ordinary arssault, .and fineli each of the pris4ners 51., or, in default, twvo months' imnprisonment; inflicting the same penalties for the assault on Miills. Wxsimsarnsai.r-3argaret Wardley, a mniddle-agel w-oman, was charged wvith a violent and brutal assault upon BElitzhaibeth Stbainer, of 3, Parkins'-cottages, Windsor-place, MWr. PAYNbTEP. said that the offence -was so serious that he should not decide it at present. He should remuand the prisoner for another week, and determine in the meantime wh.at to do with her. ('LEsuEXWELL.-Edwerd Thomas, a surgeon by professin, hut for the past20 years a pauper in ClerksenwlvlL work- louse, and officiating therein as undertaker, vas placed st the bar, on remand, before 11r. TYRWHiTT, charged with mutilatingthe body of a deceased pauper named George Harding, by sawing off the head. 3Miss Elizabeth Trist, the matron, deposed that on lionday last an application was mnade by the relatives of the deceased -his mother and sister-to see the body. She-went to the deadhouse, where she saw the coffin nailed down, and upon speaking to the prisoner he said, "NTeither you nor the deceased's friends can see the body, as the coffin is nailed down." UJpon looling round she saw the head of a msn on the ground, and immediately afterwards the prisoner took np the head, 'wrapped an dirty cloth, and she then said,' " Now, I have caught you." He said, "Do not let them see it," meaning the deceased pauper's relatives She took tp the head and conveyed it to the whardrobe, were the master having seen it brought the matter before the guar~dians, who determined to prosecute. Mr. John Jeflings, the master of the workhouse, deposeei that he was attending a board meeting when he was called into the wardrobe, and saw the head lying there. The matron was in a state of great trepidation. The prisoner admitted that it was Harding's head, and that he had taken it ofr witha saw. A post mortem examination had beenmade, but the parts that had been cut had been carefully sewn np again, and the hair covered over the parts that had been cut. The prisoner, in defence, said, he had not 3aken the head entirely; all he had taken was the face. The skull had been previously opened for a pOst mortem examination. BVr. TYRTWBr said that it was a sort of case that oughh to have been made public, and that the parish officers would have been subject to a great stigma if they had not dons so, and he considered the offence amounted to a maisdemeanour. He did not hesitate to say that it vas an offence contra bones mzores. According to the Anatomy Act of the 2d and 3d of William ITV., chap. 75, the taking away of a dead bodyto dispose of it forgainandprofit was an indietable offence. Biythe7th sectionit. wasprovided that "itshallnotbe lawful for any executor or other person having-lawful possession of the body of any deceased person, and not being an undertaker or other person entrusted with the dead body for the purpose only of interment, to permit the body of such deceased person to undergo anatomical examination unless to the knowledge of such executor or other person such person shall have expressed his desire either in writing during his life or verbally an the presence of two or more witnesses during the illness whereof he died, that his body after death might not undergo such examination, or unless the surviving husband or wle, or any knowI n relative of the deceased Person, shall require the body to be interred without examination." In this case it was shown that the prisoner had not obtained leave, and was therefore liable. If this case had not been brought forward, the parties interested would no doubt have been dissatisfied, and have expressed many hard things against the parish authorities He should commit the prisoner for trial. LAas%MsTL-Joseph Hil, a singular-looking little fellow, who described himself as a hair-dresser, residing atNo. 0, Key-street, Bristol, was charged before Mr. XBECKETT with attempting to stab Henry Hougham, 159 I with a dagger. Eougham deposed that at about half-past 11 o'clock on that morning, while on duty in the Waterlooroad, in front of the railway station, the prisoner came to him, and said he had come from Bristol to see the illuminations, andhad not the means to get back. He, witness told him the best thing he could do vas to write to his friends at Bristol for the money to talce him home, and his-reply was, that there was no use in his doing sc, and that he should make awaywith himself. Observing something wild in his manner he told him that if he accompanied him before a magistrate he would endeavour to get himn Rassed by the railway. The prisoner agreed to come with him to, this court, and wal-ed with him some distance, when he observed him pass his right hand towards his left-hand trowaers pocket, and in an instant he drew forth the dagger produced, and made a lounge at his (witness's) left groin or lowrer part of his abdomen. He, fortunately, parried off the blIJw, but the prisoner continued to stab at him, and in one of his efforts passed the instrunient right through the lappel of his coat, and bv this means he secured it, but it was with some difficulty be disarmed him of it. MAGISTeATE.-Did the prisoner say anything all this time? Witness.-Yes, Sir; he said that two years ago his fikther, at his death, had left him the dagger, as a legacy, to protect himself. AGISTRATE--And you say he made more than one or two stabs at you? A Witness.-Oh yes, sir; he made several stabs at me. Joseph Clark said, he was accidentally passing along the Waterloo-road, when he saw the prisoner armed with a dagger, and make several stabs at the policeman. He rushed at him, and endeavoured to disarm the prisoner, but he pulled the weapon through his hand, and cut his thumb. The dagger was here exibbited to the magistrate. It is a very formnidable wreapon, about 1S inches long, broad in the blade, and sharp at the point. The prisoner, who is evidently labonring under insanity, said, he had used itto protect his ow-n life. He was remanded, and the Magistrate requested that he might be attended to.

HOMICE INLONDON FOR ORIENTLSTRANGERS. On Saturday his Royal Highness Prince Albert laid the foundation stono of a building designed to supply a manifest and long felt desideratumn in the charitable institutions of the metropolis, munificent and numerous as they are, by affording all the comforts and advantages of a home, on the principle of a model lodginghouse, to natives of India Arabia, Africa, China, tho Straits of Malacca, the Mosambique, and the Islands of the South Pacific, who may require them from time to time durino- their temporar sojourn in London. No man can have walk-ed the streets of the metropolis-especially the eastern part of it-without being moved to commiseration by the utterly wretched condition of many of the Lascar seamen, and others from kindred climes-friendless, homeless and destitutein a country far distant from their own, speaking a language altogether unintelligible to the native population, and hearing one they are equaly unable to understand. To improve the condition of this class of men, whom the tide of commerce continualy brings to our shores, and whose labours tend to augment our national wealth, and to wipe out the reproach -which it reflects on our civiization, a number of benevolent gentlemen, with Sir Edward Buxton at their head, have banded themselves together for the purpose of erecting a permanent institution of the kind indicated in a central position of the locality inhabited by the seafaring population of London. The " Home" about to be erected, of wliieh Ur. C. L. Bracebridge is the architect, will be capable of accommodating 230 inmates, with apartments for the superintendent, a hospital, registry, shipping and secretary's offices, anT furnished throughout, including lighting, warming, hot and cold baths and lavatories, will cost nearly S,0001., besides 1,2501. paid for the freehold of the site, which is close to the JUnction of the East and West India Dock roads, and in the immediate vicinity of kimehouse church. The object of the directors is to offer to all Oriental strangers who visit England a comfortable and respectable lodging, with wholesome food, at a cost wvhich it is prosumed they can afford and wvhich shall render the institution self-supporting. Arrangements will also be made for taking charge of their money and other property, when desired, for makng remittances to their families and friends, tendering them advice and affording them information, protecting them from imposition, procuring them employment in vessels, and providing them with instruction in the English language. Nearly 4, 0001. has been subscribed towards the institution, including a gift of 5001. by the Maharajah Dhuleep Singh, and contributions aioenting to 1001. by other natives of India. His Royal Highness the Prince Consort arrived at the site of the building ptecisely at 4 o'clock, where he was received by the Earl of Chichester, heading a deputation of the directors of the Home, including Major-General Atlexander and others, his Highness the M3aharajah Dhuleep Singh, Bishop Can, Colonel Sykes, Chairman of the East ndia Cmpany Sir James Weir Hoer' N P. MIr. Mangles, M.P., Captain Shepherd, and several'other Directors of theEast India Company. His Royal Highness, who wore the riband and star of the Order of the Garter, was attended by the Marquis of Abercorn, who also wore the insignia of the Garter, Viscount Torrington, and Captain Du P1at; and as they entered the s5pacious marquee erected for the occasion the baud of the Royal Artillery, which was in attendance, played the national anthem. Besides the MIaharajalsihuleep Singh several other distinguished Orientals were in attendance in their magnificent national costumes, including Ishore Singh Buhadar, Rajah of Benares; Nawab Meer Jaffier Alee Klhan, Buhadar of Surat; the Syrian Archbishop, and many others. The young Princess of Coorg was also present and witnessed the ceremony. On each side of the covered avenue leading to the marquee were arranged 50 Hindoos, an equal number of Chinese and Lascars, anld several Arabs, Africans, islanders from the South Pacific, from the Malaccas, the Mfozambique, and other countries, all in native costume. The Earl of CHICuIESTE, having explained to the Prince the object of the institution, proceeded to direct the attention of his Royal Highness to the distressed and helpless condition in which, in the majority of cases, the natives of other countries employed in our commerce found themselves upon landing for the first time in this country. These natives were told (said his lordship) that our laws and institutions were the admiration and envy of other nations; that it was a country governed by a Sovereign whose Christian virtues were known and enulated by all classes; and they knew also that the people of England were a people professing the Christian religion. It was, therefore, a most painful thing, and one most degrading to the character of the country, to find that no better wselcome was accorded to those poorand helpless natives of other countries who visited our shores. The directors of that institution gladly hailed the valuable assistance which the patronage and support of his Royal Highness would confer on the new Home, which they hoped would be instrumental in wiping off the reproach which had so long attached to the country, and to the metropolis in particular. The Prince then performed the ceremony of laying the foundation stone in the usual manner, and at its conclusion The Maliarajah DHIULEEP SISGHr, addressing his Royal Highness in English, said,-On the part of the natives of India and other strangers from distant lands for whose benefit this institution was to be established he begged to thank his Royal Highness for his kindness and consideration in performing the ceremony which had now been completed. Having since his arrival in England had opportunities of observing the great necessity which existed for an institution of the kind he had thought it his duty to assist as far as lay in his power in its establishment, and through the unwearied benevolence of Colonel Hughes, Major Lavie, and the other gentlemen of the committee who had so earnestly and successfully exerted themselves in its behalf, he had now the happiness of seeing its first stone laid by his Royal Highness as an earnest of his approval of its object. He trusted that through God's blessing it might yet take a high place among the many useful institutions of this great metropolis, and he begged again to assure his Royal Highness of his heartfelt gratitude. Colonel SYKES, the Chairman of the East India Company, also addressed his Royal Highness.

DIscovERy OF AE.NCMBT WALL PATNTINGS.- Recent reparations in Hadleigh church, Essex, have been the means of bringing to light some interesting mural deco. rations, which, under the care and superintendence of the Rev. W. B. Heygate and Mr. H. W. KIing, will furnish the ecclesiastical antiquary with curious examples of the modes of adornig our churches in the middle ages and with examples of the artistic skill of the designers and decorations. The paintings in Hadleigh Church are of at least four distinct periods-tho oldest and the best in style being of the 13th century. The latest of the 15th century upon the north wall, is a domi figure of the " Virgin Crowned and a Woman in the attitude of Supplication." Near this is the entire figure of " St. James the Less," to whom the church is dedicated. Among the paintings of a later date is a very large representation of the legend of " St. George and the Dragon," with all the accessories necessary to the full comprehension of the story, such as the " King and the Queen, and their beautiful daughter, who was given up to be devoured by the monster, which is represented as pierced through the head by the spear of the Champion of Christendom." On the staircase leading to the rood loft is a figure of Beckett in pontificals, and, in Lombardic characters, "BmKIJms TOMA.S." It is to he feared that it will be impossible to preserve all these curious paintings;but MEr. King is snaking careful drsigs n Mr. Heygato is sparing no pains in order thlat they may be foully uncovered.
