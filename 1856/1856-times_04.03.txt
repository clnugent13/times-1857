COVENT-GARDEN THEATRE. TO THE EDITOirOF THE TinIES. Sir,-I am sorry again to trouble you in reference to Mr. Gye's letter in your paper of to-day, but I do not think hi; objections to my statement are fairly put. 'The RoyalItalian Opera Conpany were our tenants forth a season 1850. Of this companyM. Gye was one, but I see no reason for giving him the exclusive credit for the rent paid for that season, any more than I should give it to eaca of the other arrtistes, and my statement remains the same,- that the rent received from AMr. Gye for five years was under 30,0001. I repeat that if Mr. Gye did not know on the 31st of December that the acceptance for 4401. was not paid he knew it on the 31st of March last, and he knows it now. Mfr. Gye says,-"I have been informed this afternoon by the principal manager that the 4401. was paid more than two months ago." This would be the end of January; but the facts are that more than half of the first acceptance for 4401. was not paid till the 5th of January, and the other acceptance for 4401. was paid-1001. on the 14th of Janmary, and 3401. on the 21st of January; and MIr. Gye having, my statement before him, in which credit for the 4401. was given in the January, was bound to accept that statement until he could show it was incorrect. In addition to the 1,7001. now admitted I infer Mr. Gye to mean that he also owes a quarter's rent. Why not two quarters ? His yearly term expired on the 1st of October last. In November and Decemher he let the theatre for Jullien's concerts, and in January, February, and March he let the theatre to Mr. Anderson for 2,0001. With respect to the 7501. reserved, but due to the proprietors fromn Mr. Gye on account of season 1854, Mr. Gye remarks, " It is a sum payable only in case of my receiving a certain amount of money due to me, there being no liability on my part unless I do receive it." This version of the 7501. is entirely new to me; if my recollection is correct (our treasurer being unfortuniately ill inthe country), thlis sum is due for a balance of rent 1854, and Mr. Gye has the 7501., our money, in his possession, his plea to not paying it over being a request that the proprietors would give it up upon the grounds that just upon the opening of the season 1854, and when his arrangements had all been completed, it became imperative upon him to increase his expenditure by engaging Sianor Tamburmni (Ithink) and another artist, and that by these engagements he had incurred an increased outlay; that the proprietors by this arrangement would get an increase of rent by the increased attraction, and that therefore they ought to pay one-seventh of the salary paid to these two artists, and, in furtherance of this request, Mr. Gye has kept back and retained the one-seventh, 7501.; but till today I never heard of any legal obstacle to our being paid the amount if insisted upon ; but, in consequence of my co-proprietors being scattered about, we have never niet to come to any decision upon it, my own feeling, as Mr. Gye is aware, beng in favour of his having this amount allowed him. Mr. Gye's tenancy terminated onthe lst of October. His rent was 6,501. per annum, 5,000l. to be paid from the Italian Opera by the31st of August, and the 1,5001. balance of rent on the 1st of January following. Surely any one holding under such an agreement, and having paid, we will suppose, the 5,0001. by the 31st of August, would have known that the 1,5001. became a debt on the Ist of October, hut payable on theist of January, the same as though any one gave a bond payable after a person's death. The debt, I presoume, becomes a debt upon the executiona3nd delivery of *the bond, but the payment is deferred; but yet MIr. (lye still insists that on the 31st of December he only owed 2101. In my statement there were two sums, 33SI. s. 4d arrears received by Mr. Gye, and 1531. 5s. 46. to be received by him, and, of course, the proprietors only ask for the latter amount so soon as Air.

I The Thirtieth Annual Meeting of this company was held hero on Friday, the 21st day of Mlarch current; lexander Stronach, Esq,, of Druallan, chairman of the ordinary directors, in the chair. Ahighly satisfactory report for the finaucial year. ending 31st of January last vas submitted by the directors, from wlich It appeared that, whilc th e premiums for fire insurances have been coxsiderably ineceased, 413 newv pohlies have been issued in the lfe department, the sumsassuredlby wfhich amountto £16;5,410, and the urenriumson them to £5,192 Es. 2d. The claims by death have be^n extremely moderate, the mortality having been much below the average. A large addition lias in consequence been made to the life fiunds, the accumulation of which is steadily progressing, as required by the principles of life assurance, to meet augmenting liabilities. The progress of the business in England, iuder the auspices of tle London bard, was stated to be highly satisfactory, and the prospect of increasing success very encouragiing. From the profits for the year, available to the company as a proprietary instituition, the directors proposed to pay the usual dividend of 7t per cent., free of income-tax. The Chairman proposed that the report be adopted; and, with reference to the progress of the company in England, said he had no fears for the future. The London board was composed of firAtclars men, bne of hoam he was happy to see present at this meeting; and their secretary, Mr. Wardrop, had nroved himself possessed of that umtiring energy and perseverance w.iich under the auspices of such a body of directors, and having such a field for exertion, must insure success. The motion for the adoption of the report was unanimously James Anrdersoni, Esi., of Biliter-square, London, expressed great pleasure in being presernt at the meeting, and, as one of the Lonioa board of directors, said he had no hesitation in confirming the hopre of success in England entertainedI by the directors in Aberdeen. He had long taken a deep interest in the progress of life assurance, having entire confdce in the principles of the system, and i' beneficial influence in fostering a spirit of independence, which, if eulciently extended, woulddlo much to render poor-rates umec Mr. Anderson then pronosed a vote of thanks to the direetosa n' lhead-oflice, which was ceodially agreed to and acknowledged by the chairman.

RETURRNS. On the motion of Sir J. DURE, returns were ordered of the consumption of hops and malt, of the number of brewers, and of the amounts paid as duty on insurances. MEEDICAL PROFESSION BILL Mr. HEADLAM moved that the Speal-er should leave the chair in order that the House might go into committee on this bill. Lord R. GROSVENOR, diselaiming any intention to offer a ve-xatious opposition to the progress of this measure called attention to the fact that there had that morning appeared upon the paper notices of nearly 10) amendments, some of which materially affected the principle of the bill with the effect of which it was quite impossible that hon members could have made themselves acquainted. He therefore, without making any motion upon the subject, recommended his hon. and learned friend (Mr. Headlam) to postpone for the present the further consideration of the.. bill. Mr. BARROW concurred in the reconunendation of the noble lord. He was favourable to the principle of the bill. i s it stood, which was that the medical profession should be governed by a representative.body; but he found that bythe first amendment upon the paper it wasproposed entirely to depart from this principle, and to substute for this re- presentative body a council nominated by the Government.- So important an alteration ought to have been referred td inthe debate upon the second reading, and, at aU events, ought not to be discussed at 10 minuites' notice. Mr. HE-ADLAM could not accede to the request whichhad been addreggd to him, that he would postpone this bill. His refusal did not arise from any personal feeling, but from a consideratiorr of the evil whieb would result to the whole medical profession from any ftluher delay, The principal matter for decision was is to, the couposition of the council, and he had not the slightest hope that, if tbe consideration of the questioi were- posttponed - for 10 years, any arrangement could be come to nupon that subject It was one that the House' must decide; and for the decLsion of which he believed that hon. members were mow perfectly prepared. Although the aiendments of 'whih notice had been givenamounoted in number to 70 6r 80, yet 19 out of 20 of themdepended upon the settlement of one or two great principles, and would depend upon how- such questions as the composition of the council, the number of registrars, and the power of the colleges to license were decided.. .- "; ' - Mr. WALTER said that, so far from the amendmelts being of a merely technical character, the 62d asserted a pncple to which the attention of the House ought to be ted. That amendment, wiihicl was pre byanh6n. member whose name was on theback-ofthe hlll,n rohibited, under a penalty of 5., any person from prebing medicines or acting in any medieal capacity s nless he' Fas registered under this act. He (fr. Water) did not stand there as the advocate of any new fangled ystem of medi, cine; but he must say that if Briishsubjectswereto hve aghof prvt jdm na 'nything, surely they were arght ofprivate judgmient ' URitled to exercise it in matters which fected their own health. (Hear, hear.). Such a 'prohibition as that to which he had referred was a mattei far'timiortanttobeintroducedby an ameAdment, and one-upon which the House ought to come to a .decision before going into committee upon thebilL Dr.MICEELL, havingremarkedthat theoperation of the bill would be to throw open the medicil profession, and to cor,vert all the chymistb and druggists into apothecaries, observed that, thouLgh himself friendly to the general principle of the bill, he could not admit thatthe measure hadbeen received with as much favour as its advocates seemed anxious to represent. The petitioners were exactly two toe one against it, there being 800 for it and precisely 1,600 against. The 19th clause, which proposed to gMve to the council the power to strike off the list of medical practitioners any one who might be found guilty of anything so vague and indefinite as that cornprisedin the term"misconduct," 'vas far too loosely worded for a penal enactment (hear, hear); and, indeed, to speak generally, the 'details of the biU demanded revision and were susceptible 'o great improvement. Sir G. GREY understood his noble friend tae member for Middlesex (Lord R. Grosvenor) to have suggested that, in consequence of the numerous amendments of which notice had been given so recently, the better course would be to postpone the further consideration of the bil to some future period. That was a proposaliwhich it was to be hoped would assume the form of a motion, so that the House mught decide upon it at once, and avoid the irregularity of discussing thedetails ofthe bill at the present stage. It -was no doubt to be regretted that the amendments in question had been p laced upon the paperat so late a period, but for this the Government were not fairlyresponsible. Thereasonwhy earlier notice had not been given-of the amendment-forrernodelling the council-that stood in the name of his right hon. friend the President of the Board of Health was simply that it was not until yesterday that the Government had had interviews on the subject of the bill with deputations representing the various branches of the medical body in the three kingdoms. The day for those interviews had been fLxed at the desire of the medical profession, through whose act-and not through that of the Government-it had happened that they (the Government)hadnvt untilso lately been put in possession of the vie ws of the faculty with reference to this measure. It appeared to be the general wish of tlhe gentlemen who formed the deputations that the bi should he brought into committee with a viev, no doubt, to the intro-- ductjonof very important amendments. They wereunanimous. in objecting to the present constitution of the council, and seemed to favour the proposal that the nomination of that body should be left, to a great extent, if not altogether,' in the hands of the Government. After collecting the' opinions of the different departments of the medical profession, the Governsnent arrived at the conclusion that there were good and substantial objections to the council as originally proposed to be constituted, and they accordingly placed upon thc paper the amendment that stood there in; name of his right hon. friend (3Mr. Cowper. The amendment referred to by the hon. member for Nottingham (Mr. Walter)--that which proposed the imposition of a penalty on persons acting as physicians without being duly registered-was, doubtless, a very important one,' but there was no reason that he (Sir G. Grey) could see -why it should not be carefully considered and satisfactorily dis-! posed of in committee. It certainly did not occur to him that it was an amendment so foreign to the general principle of the bill as to render it necessary that the present measure should be withdrawn and a new one substituted. As the constitution of the council-a matter to which the hon. member for South Nottinghamshire (Mr. Barrow) appeared to attach peculiar importance-and all other questions of detail could nowhere be soj effectively discussed as in committee, he would suggestthat the biU should be Permitted to pass into that stage without further d6hy (Hear, hear.) ,r. "WALPOLE observed that the House had sanctionEd the secondreading under theimpressionthattherewas among the medical corporations ageneral concurrence of opinion I favour of the bill; but, as that impression had been proved to be erroneous, the more judicious course would be to postpone till a future day the further progress of the measure. (Hear, hear.) Individuslly he was disposed to regard with favour the amendment of which the Gtovernment had given notice with respect to the constituation of the council but neither the House nor the Government had had sufficient notice of the many alterations proposed to be introduced in the hill-alterations which would materially affect its character and operation. (Hlear, hear.) hedid not mean to say that there might not he many members at that moment in the house who were fuly qualiied to discuss the bill, bnt others were not so favourably circumstanced in the regard (hear); and it was not convenient that that House should be required to go into committee on a measure of such great importance unless they had had ample opportunity of becoming fanuliar with its provisions. The fact that the Government had felt it their duty, at the eleventh hour, to propose an essential alteration inthe constitution of the bil was in itself a sufficient justification for postponement. (Hear, hear.) He woulld add that if the promoters of the bill had no other object than to procure the passing of sucha measure of medical reform as would find favour both with the public and the profession, they would do wrell to consider the propriety of referring either the biUl or the subject to a select committee. (HIear, hear.) F?or the present, howvever, he would content himself with moving that the further consideration of the bill be postponed til next Wednesday. (Hear, hear.) Mr. DRUMMOND said, it would really appear as though the doctors were of opinion that their fellow-creatures not in the profession were their material property-their goods and chattels-which they might treat in whatever manner they pleased. This bill would stereotype aUl medical knowledge, arrest the progress of scientific discovery, and effectuaUy prevent any advance in the most important of all arts. Nay, more; it would bind us down for aU fautrity to the compounds and preparations of the pharmacopceia now in use. (Hear, hear.) Against such legislation he, for one, would never cease to raise his voice. If the doctors had had their own way we should never have had chloroform, or any other of the valuable discoveries that, in modern times had been introduced with such advantage to the interests of humanity. Never was it less expedient for the HIouse to sanction such a measure as this than at the present moment when, by means of vegetable and animal chymistry, such extraordinary progress was being made in the science of health. (Hear. ) Lord EBRINGTON advocated a reference of the whole subject to a select columittee. It was clear that the bill corld not command the full approval of the medical profession, many of whom were ignorant of the amendments proposed to be adopted. Mr. CRAUFU1>D objected to a postponement, and did not think- that the mere fact that noticehad been given co numerous amendments furnished adequate justification for a proceeding which might eventually result in the defeat of the measure. With regard to the particular amendment to which exception had been taken by the hon. member for Nottingham (Mr. Walter), he could only say that to the principle of that amendment both he and his hon. and learned friend the member for Newcastle-on-Tyne (Mr. Headlam) were decidedly hostile. Mr. HENLEY was favourable to a postponement. It was desirable that opportunit should be afforded to ascertain hovw far the gentleumen who had waited on the Home Secretary fairly represented the opinions of the various corporations whose views they had undertaken to interpret. The House should act cautiously on sucl a question, andnot deem themselves such unerring judges as not to need to be informed of the feelings with which the medical profession regarded the important alterations proposedtobeintroduced into the bill. (Hear.) 3Er. HEADLAIfelt called upon to offer an observation with respect to the medical corporations which had placed themselves in communication with the Home Secretary. The facts were these. The bill under discussion was introduced last session, and not only was itcirculated throughout the country during the recess, but copies were forwarded to each of the medical bodies which had sent deputations to the Home-office. They embodied their opinions on it in the form of reports which they addressed to the Home-office, and it was from an attentive perusal of these documents that the inference was gathered that there was in the profession a unanimous feeling in favour of the principle of the bilL Thero was no discrepancy between the reports in question and the views now advocated by the medical bodies. There was still a general feeling in favour of the whole bill, but a difference of opinion existed with respect to various portionsof it. That difference of opinion, always entertained, and now only varied in the manner of its expression, had induced the Government to alter their owvn views on the subject. Such, in a few words, was the present state of the question. One thing was clear to him-namely, that by 'postponig the bill he should be acting in direct opposition to the opinions and feelings of all the medical ,co rations without exception. With this conviction, and the knowledge that the postponement of the bill would be almost equivalent to its rejection, he could not assent to thc amendment of the right hon. gentleman the memberfor Cambridge University. Lord ELCHO did not think that in this case postponement was necessarily synonymous with abandonment. The bill as at present framed would injure the universities, and deliver over graduates in medicine bound hand and foot to the mercy of medical corporaticns. If the present measure were postponed he would, on a future day, move for.leave .to introduce a bill which was drawn up last session and privately circulated, .and which embodied the -jiews of the universities-institutions'-of which -he could only remark that, in this instance, their interests were identical with those of the public. .Mr. BRADY resented the imputations sought to be cas' on the medical profession by the hon. member for West Surrey, and,while adrmitting with regret the aver'sionof the medical corporations from reform, bore iestimony -to the high- attairiments of the- gentlemen - who-presided over those associations, and claimed for the profession gene-. raUy credit for unselfish motives amid an anxious desire to promote the interests of science. Finally, he expressed his willingness to withdraw hIs amendment for inposing a penalty on practitioners not legally registered as such, lekits retention should endanger the safety of the bilL Mr. BLACK approved the suggestion to remit thM bill toa select committee bynieansor which anopportunitywoulcl be afforded them to deliberatly consider what provisionw would be best for the advantage both of the ublec and the, profe.;don. The adoption of tscourse would, he beEeved, yalike to the edical Cole of Edinburglb and to the professors oE the university of ~that city. The great object of any measure of this kind s to sBcure 2 perfect standard of qualification, together with equalighi of practice, and a properrgsration. - Mr. BABROW said, his objection was not that that. House only, but the publc also hadhad no notice of the txtensive alteration which the Govermment proposed to make~ in this bill. The measure of last year contained the reprosentative principle, but the Government now contemplite& the denial of thatadvantage to the Vrofesiou. The omne Secretary stated that his clause modifying the constitutionj of the council was -framed out of deference to the opinions. of certain individuals connected with particular localities but these persons surely could not be regarded as the representatives of the great body of the profession throughout the united kingdom. Their modest request, in fact, rexembledt one that might have been made, when the Reform Bill was under discussion, by Calne to have itself and Gatton continued as Parliamentary boroughs, while populous placeF like 3anchester were altogether esiduded from the representation. (A laugh.) Sir G. GREY explained that he yesterday saw the accredited representatives of the Royal Uollege of Physidans i=r England, of the College of Physicians in Edinburgh, of the Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Glasgow, of Thniver. Fity College, London, and of the graduAtes of the University i of Dublin, none of whom advocated such a representatiorr in the Medical Council as was proposed by this bilL, tHezr. ihear.) The consideration given by these bodies to the bill of last year was certainly not such as the importance of the measure deserved; but then great difficulty was always experienced in elicting public opinion in regard to such a scheme until the intention to proceed with it was known to be bond jfide. After hearing the matter fully and fairly discussed, he was led to believe that the objec. tions uied to the proposed compsosition of the council were valid, ewas, therefore, quite prepared,on the part of | the Government, to go mto committee, if such were the pleasure of the House, and to state in detail the reasons Ewhichhad inducedhim to give notice of his amendment isa *ion of the council. But if the gene-al feeling of the House was opDosed-as it appeared to beto the discussion of this and ot er important'alterationsuntil a longer time had been allowved for their due consideration, a delay of a week or sofor that purpose would not be unreasonable. The proposal to refer the-bill to a select committee was not; regularly before the House. Colonel DUNNE apologized for the shortness of the notice he bad given of certain amendments which stood iv. his name. The trath was, he had notlhadan opportunityof communicating -aith members of the medical profession ina Ireland until the Easter recess, and his amendments were intended to give effect to their opinions. Mr. IDUNCOMBE observed that the introducer of thi; bill had himself given notice of no less than three pages of amendments, and it would certaifly require a reference to a, select committee to enable them to understand the alterations which the author proposed to make in his own measure. (A laugh.) At the same time he (Mr. Dunoombe) must honestly confess that he should vote for sending the bill before a select committee in the hope of getting rid of it; I altogether-a result which would, no doubt, followv the sub- jection of the measure to such an ordeaL (Lavghter.) The Home Secretary told them that the College of Surgeons and the Society of Apothecaries were more or less opposed to this bill, but not a word did the right hon. baronet sayabout. the feeling of the public. He (Mr. Duncombe) represented a. verymixedconstituency, which induded doctors andall sorts of persons,andceertainly, as farashe could gather the opinicir of the people, it was decidedly hostile to any meddling of the kind contemplated by this measure. Was every medical man to be denominated a "quacle' merely because he might not be duly registered under this bill ? The homccopathist, for instance, would not be registered- and, oE course, the medical oligarchy now proposed to te set up vould refuse him a licence to practise. But had the public. norightsinregardto this matter? Was a man not tobeallowed to judge for himself how he would be treated? Thi& bill said, "No; you shall be doctored in our way, wvhether youlike it or not2' (A laughl) Another most obnoxious bill, and one most repugnant to the feelings of the people, waslatelyintroduced into that house, me aluded to the, measure making vaccination compulsory. (Hear, hear.1 Vaccination might be a very excellent thing, but the people had no iden of having a ParflPmentary Lancet stucnc into( them or their children at the dictation of the Board of Health (laughter); and there was no chance of the me.- sure on that subject passing into law. Sir -J. PAKUNGTON reminded the hon. member for Finsbury that the question before the House was, notwhether this bill should be sent to a select committee, butwhether it should be postponed for a week. (Hear, hear.} *Whatever mnight be the merits or demerits of the measure, it was very hard, if not unfair, to ask the hon. and learned: gentleman (Mr. Headlam) to postpone it for a week, because, if that were agreed to, the result would be, not a delay of one we-k but of many weeks, and the bill would not, improbablv fail altogether. If the bill was to be thrown out, let it be thrown out upon its merits, and not by a side wind, in the shape of a niotion for delay. (Hear, hear.) The Home Secretary having proposed important changes in the, measure, if the postponement was insisted upon the hon. and learned gentleman would be entitled to call on the: Government to take charge of the bill, and put it into ther form in which they desired to see it pass. ( Mr. ELLIOT suggested that the House should go into. committee, and stop at the clause which the right hon. baronet (Sir G. Grey) proposedto alter. Sir J. PAINGTO.N rose'to explain. He understood, that an expression which had fallen from him had hurt the feelings of his right hon. friend (3Mr. Walpole). In saying that the proposition for a postponement was like am attempt to get rid of the bill by a side wind, he (Sir J. Pakington) had not meant to impute to his right hon. friend the sli'ghtest intentional unfairness (hear, hear), huta merely to express his owvn opinion of the inevitable effect of the course recommended. The House then divided. The numbers were,- For the postponement ... ... ... 116 Against it ... ... ... ... S1 Majority ... ... ... 35 Mr. TEEADLA4 wished, after this division, to come to some understanding with the Government. (Hear4 Thechargeofthisbill had beennone of his seeking. In fact, when he originally went with a deputation to theGovernment on this subject, feeling that such a measure was not one that a private member could advantageously' introduce, he strongly urged the Home Secretary to undertake it. The right hon. baronet, however, argued, with. greatapparent plausibility, thatif the question were left to the Government it was likely to be thrown over til the end of the session, when it wiould have little chance of passing. At the same time he (Mr. Headlam) neverwould have taken charge of the bill unless he had felt assured that he would have the cooperation of the Government in carrying it. He had no wislh to cast any personal imputation upon any one, yet it was manifest that the Governient, by proposing their amendment at the last moment, had caused the adverseresult wbich the House now witnessed. (Hear, hear.) Ift they had not voted against him he should have had a majority, and been in a condition to go on -with the measure; but, as it was, the Government havingr completelythrown him over, it was their duty henceforward. to undertake the conduct of this bilL. (Hear, hear.) Sir G. GREY said, it was true that last year a deputation of medical practitionersheadedby the hon. and learned gentleman rwaited upon him to request the Govermnent to take charge of a bill which they had prepared, and that he haddeclined on the part of the Government to do so; pointing, as a reason for his refusal, tothe fatethat attended previous attempts at medical legislation which had miscarried at the moment whenit was supposed that all was ripe for a satisfactorysettlement, owing to grave differences which aro-e between the representatives ofthe different branches of the profession. The deputation, however, replied that their bill was a very popular one, and free from objections to which other schemes were liable; and that it the Government only took charge of it it would pass with great facility. Being; still very sceptical on that point, he then added that even if the Government took it in hand there wouldi be little prospect of its becoming law that session, im consequence of the heavy amount of other business with which they were occupied; but, at the same time, he told the deputation that if they had the great confidence in the popularty and success of their neasurewhich they expressed he could name no private member more competento to take charge of it in theHouse of Commons than the hon_ andlearned member for Newcastle. He was then asked whether he would agree to the formal introduction of the bill, merely -in order to have it printed and circulated through the country during the prorogation of Parliament; and he gave a ready assent to that propoall. The answers given by many bodies conneclel with the medical profession at - first led him to. suppose thnat the measure might be favoturably received, but at a later period the obstacles of which he had warned the hon. and learned gentleman, whom he thought. too sanguine, again appeared, and when the bill was fized for committee the most discordant opinions were expressed bytheprofession as to ita details. This induced him to. congratuLate himself that the bill was in the hands of tha lhon, and learned gentleman, and notiu those of the Goverm- ment. The hon. and leared member had no right to compla of the decision at which the House had arrived. If theyhadgone into committee that day no real progress. coulc have been made, and their time would have been wholly wasted. He must decline, on behalf of the Government, to talke charge of the bill, but if the hon. and learned gentleman persevered with it, he (Sir G. Grey) should move such amendments as he thought calculated to improve its provisions. It would, perhaps, be better to refer this question to a select committee, or even to a commission, by which more useful results might be ob- tained than had flowved from previous inquiries of then same kind; but, at al events, the Government, possessed as. the were of the view s of the various branches of the medical profession, were not prepared to bring in a bill on this subject during the present session. 3Mr. WALPOLE hoped that the hon. and learned gentlcman (Mr. Headlam) ivould not persist in his somewhst hasty resolution of having nothing more to do vith this measure. (Hear, hear.) He (Mr. Walpole) had no desire -to see the bi entirely rejected. He thought they were now nearer than ever to a settlement of this question ; and if the hon. and learned gentleman. next Wednesday, moved that. -this measure -be referredito a select committee, instead of then going on with it in committee of the -whole House, nodoubt he would receive valuable assistance from the Govern- ment, and be enabled ultimately to establish an efficient. registration of medical practitioners, founded on an exami- nation 'test which would affiorda guarantee to the public that the members of the profession were duly qualiiied for the discharge of their important duties. After a few words from 3Mr. BRAXDY, Mr. COWPER said, this was undoubtedly avery difficult 'question, but he agreed -with the right hon, gentIsm=an-op po0ite that they ere now appro.7ching its solution. He thought there vould be no difficulty in preparing a measure' bichvould receive the sanction of the Souse, and which, | Tough it alight not be acceptable to every wortion of the psofession, vould be satisfactory to those whio aiewed the -sulsjectin a caln, impartial, and unprejud.ced mnanner, and -wvould, at the same time, be advantageous to the public. It * could not be said with justice that the bill of the hon. and 'ltarned member for Mewtcastle had been opposed by the -Covernanent, for they were ready to support the principle *cf bis measulre; and because they were ua;ious that it shculd be successful they desired its amendment. He be. ilieved there would be no objection on the part of the Go-reanment to refer this bill to a select commzittee, or to reeconmend the appointment of a commission of inquiry. Sir JLPAKINGTON Thought the difficulty of dealing -'vith this subject was evidenced by the conduct of Her 3Iajesty's Governmnent, for since he had been in the house ~he had heard the samne members of the Government speak -on bcoth ,sides of the question. (A lan"h.) He bad heard the right hon. Secretary for the Home ~)epartmient (Sir G. XGrey) declare that he wrould vote for going into committee Isut the right hon. baronet alterwiards spoke against going into connmittee, and supported his opintions by his vote. {Laughter.) Sir G. GREY.-I gave may re.asons. Sir . PGINTOX.-Yes, but the righnt hon. ba7ronet also gave his reasons for the course he recommended in the flrst instance. (Laoughter.) He (Sir J. Pakington) thought -the hon. and learned memuber for lNew-castle had some reason to complain of the conduct of Her Majesty's Government, inst after the intimzations of the Home Secretary, and of -the righnt hon. gentleman (MIr. Cowvper), that the Govern. m-ent w-ould consent to refer the bill to a .select committee, * or to issue a commission on the subject, he wou3d recoin. ,nernd the hon. and learned gentleman not hastily to aban. * don the measure (hear, hear), hut to consider vwhich of those courses it might be most desirable to adopt. lo.-d H. A-A NE, with the vievw-of arriving at some practi.c:al seStlemn lt of this question,iadvised the hon. and learned wnemher wvho introduced the bill to assent to the proposal. of -the Government for the appointment of a select comnmilttee. Lord EBRINGTbN was of opinion that the public here -deeply indebted to the hon. and learned mem'oer for New. Castleforvbrinithis subject under the considerationof the House, anwd e hoped the hen, gentleman wvould net hastily abandon the measure. Mr. GthOGAo thought they were now nearer the settlement of this question than they had been at any former period, and he recommended the hon. and learned iember for ewcastle to consent to refer his bill to a select coInznittee. Lord ELGH0 caid that, smice the division took place, several hon. nmenbers had pressed him to introdnce the bill on this subject to wihich he had referred in addretsin the House. He begghed, therefore, to give notice that he would -to-:norrowt move for leave to introduce a bill for aniendmig T;he laws relating to the medical profession; and he thoughlt ;the bes-t mode of dealing with the neustiol wvould be by ppointing a Royal commission of inquiiy, and, incthe meantime, reerring his hill and that of the hon. and learned member for Newcastle to a select comnittee. (Hear.) Mir. E. BALLTO: thought the House had had quite enoughof medicil e for one morning, and that, as the postponement ofthe bil had been areed npon, it was uselessoto waste -rther timein discussion. He would remind the House that the remaining period of the day's sitting would pro. bihably be occupied in the consideration of an important ancasure (the Eactories Bill) which stood nelet upon the paper. er. BARROW recommended the hon. and learned membcerfor tewcastle not(to abandon his bii, observino that he thouiht a complete re,istration of medical practitioners and the abolition of those distinctions wrhich viw excisted ibet seen membes of the profession in Scotland, Ireland, and England where measures which would be attended w,ith -reat advantage. Lt was then agreedothat the committee on the bill should be postponed until next hednesday. FACTOR.IES BILL. On the order of the day for the second reading of this bil k;eing read, Colonel FaTTEN observed that, as, when he introduced the measure,ht ere were very Few members present, it night be ad.isable that he should now explain its objectspe had introduced the hill at the suggestion of a large body of his constituents, owners of factories, who for severalyears had suffered great oppression under the existing law,-. The object of the bill was to place the gear and shafting of machinery, so far as legislation was concerned, upon the same footing with machinery itselF. As some hon. gentlemen might rot be wvare of the difference bet een shafting and g7ear and machinery, he might exiplain that in every factory there -as connected with the steam-en fine a shaft to which were attached several " drums," i which w.-ere nsed for the purpose of putting the real machinery of the factory in 7motion. Nsow;, there wa7s a difference in the law7 relating to the machinery of mills and to shafts and drums, and hi3 object was to as7imilate the law with regard to b(th. The rth and 5th of Bictoria, chap. 15, sect. 21, required owgnero of factories to pLace secure fencing round all the shafts and oearing; and the 4ed clause of that wenabled the factory occupiers to submit any case of dispnte with regard to mhachinery, a distinguished from shafting and gearing, to barbitration. The arbitrators were entponered to determie msut only whether it was necessary that machisner should he renced off, butAalso te particular mode in which it should ibe fenced. with reoard to shafting, howlever, there was no power of arbitration, but every manufacturer in the country .adS compuisorily required to fence off every portion of shafting, w.hererer it might be, and however ttiumhely it ewas that the operatives should cone in contact with it. The ale which had more im hediately led to his bringing this ubject beforethe House was a trial which hadrecently taken place in L ancashire. A manufacturer, havinlg placed his shafts tlona the roofsot the rooms in his factory, at O height ofr feet from the ground, and out o- reach of his evorkpeople, believedhe had complied with the law. An accident, however, occurred in the mill, and an action was brought against the mtanufacturer for non-cownpliance wi th -the provisions of the Factory Act. The man ufacturer, believsag that he had complied with these profisions, went to tsiaL The crase vpas tried before ir. Justice Crowder, --who ruled that the lawe must be interpreted strictly ad literally, fand a verdict v-was iven egainst the defendant, -the manufacturer. The defendant then applied for a new trial, on the ground of miedirection on the part of the judge, and a newrtrial was ordered. The c.,se was tried tefore r. Justice Cressw ell, at Liverpool, and that learned -rtude-who, from early association, wwas, perhaps, the rost competent judge on the bench to try a case of the thind-ruled that,oas the shaftingvas placed at such a height from tihe ground that it could not come in contact with the workieopze, the requirements of tile act had been coma - 3-ied with, and the jury glave their verdict for the manufacture-, subject to the opinion of the Court above upon the point of law. The case i as, therefore, carried into the Court of (Queen's Bench, where Lord Campbell tookthe san:e -s-evw as MIr. Justice Crowvder, and said that, whatever -were the circumstances of the case, the law must ie strictly and literally interpreted, and thatr,as it appearea there waS notfinrwhichtcouldbe held to be fenciun in the eye of law,, the judgment of MEr. Justice Cressawell wvas w rong, and nwust be reversed. 'his decision had placed tle w pole body of manufacturers in a most awskward dilemma, fur, wherever their shafting and gearing might be, and whatever might -e its extent, they rere compelled to fence it off completely. aurins the vacation he (Colonel Fatten) had visited numerous milL11, including some of the very newvest construction, and, from the immense extent of shafting and dlrums, he bad comue to the conclusion that it was totally ihphasible for manufacturers to comply with the law as it was laid doan by lord Cafpell. Be had visited the factory of Mr Miller, at Preston, which was one of the largest in the country, and he had been struck with the beauty and completeness of the arrangemnents for the protection of the workmen. tio a Iller had expended what would be to many persons a little fortune in providino for the security of the operatives, wand he had erected the sTiating along the roofs of his rooms, believing that, as his workpeople w,ould thus be protected, he bad comlplied wi th the requirements of the law; hut, accordtglto the decisin of lord Campbell, if an a accident occurredinhis on ll he would not only be lible to averyt arge fine, but also to an action, whsich sight be brought against him by any indi idu1l, for non-compliance with the larn. 'Ihe shafting in MIr. Miller's factory was miles in extent; so far as he could see every portion of it was beyond the reach -otf any humpan heid and he thonght it a t reat hardship -that a gentleman wheos had done so musc for the protection of his woro-uenple should be placed in the predicament in which he found himself under the existing law. He (Colonel iPatten) reque ted the overlookers of all the factories ,in Pre:ston-a town with a population of 70,000 persons-to meet him, and state to bim their opinions on the subject generally, and also whith refe-ence to the present bill. They were unanimously of -opinion that itewasimpossible for any manufacturer on a large scale to comply literaly with the proions of the ex'isting act, and to keep himself out of reach of the law, and they considered his (Colonel Patten's) bill mostreasonuable -epressing their belief that it vwould not increase in any -degree, but would in many instances diminish the dangers -to which operatives were exposed. If danger was to be apprehended from shafting placed at such a hei-ht from the ground as he had mentioned, -what, ke asked, must be the dan-er to vwbich operatives were subjected from the macuinery amid which they had to pass in every part of a mill He believed the danger froin the machiner to be a thousandfold greater than that from shafting and gearing. The protection of anaclunery had been for years the subject of arbitration, but Ie believed that durina the last six years, throughout 'the -whole of England, Scotland, and Ireland, there bad not been 20 cases of arbitration or of disputes between masters and inspectors as to whether machinery should be fenced. He sunderstood it hed been said by some of the inspectors that if shafting and gearin; were placed -upon the same footing as mnachinery endless oisputes would occur. He beleved one of the inspectors stated that in one mil he found abont g1,700 cases of daner connected with shafting and gearing. If that were the case, he (Colonel Patten) would venture to say there would be at least 3,000 cases of danger arising from the machinery. He had no doubt, if his proposition were adopted to place shafting on the same footing with machinery, that a very few cases of arbitration would rule any disputes which might sukequently arise, and it was therefore abeurd to contend thatthe time of the inspectors.would be occupied in deal. ing with such disputes. He deemed it a great hardship that manufacturers should be subjected to an exceptional law whichidid not apply to any other class of H er Majesty's subjects; and liT believed, rhen the enormous number of persons employed in factories wag taken into account, it would be found that the Proportion of accidents in such establishments was less t-han those occurring in iron. foundries, candle manufactories, and soap manufactoriea, or even than those which resulted freom agricultural imple- snents. (Hear, hear.) Om.e of the most grievous features of the present system was, that the enforcement of the law was committed to a body of men, the factory inspectors, against whom individually he had no complaint to makefor from some of them, and especially from Mr. Homner, he had received much assistance and information, and he felt bound to acknowledge the courtesy with which they had treated him. He had, however, a complaint to make zgainst the inspectors, arising out of the verynature of their duties-namely, that the variety of their decisions rendered it almost impossible for any manufacturer in the country to know how he was situated with regard to the law. (Hear, hear.) The House would scarcely credit the number of j confli6ting decisions which had been given by theinspectors upon questions connected with the Factory Act. He would trouble the House with one or two illustrations of these decisions. The first question which arose under this act was whether fencing should be required for shafting or not. In some districts the inspectors required absolute compliance with the act, and, consequently, that aU shafting of whatever kind should be fenced; while in other districts the directions were less strict. In a parer issued by Mr. Homer, the chief inspector, and the other inspectors, and dated the 2.3d of January, 1855, they said * " The inspectors, therefore, by direction of Viscount Palmerston, have again to call the attention of the occupiers of factories of the united kingdom to the continued nonoboserance of the 21st section. of the 7th of Victoria, chap. 15, in regard to the 'securely fencin-' of alU horizontal shafts, at whatever heights they may be from the floor; and they hereby give notice that it will be their dutyto take steps for enforcing the abovementioned provision of the Factory Act." An accompanying letter from Mr. Homer contained these passages- "Having every reason to believe that experiencehas proved the efficiency of the above modes of fencing, I feel myself warranted in holdiDg every horizontal shaft which is providedwith substantialrectangularhooks or rods to besecurely fenced against accidents caused by the lapping of the straps, hut not against other accidents. I therefore feel it my duty to warn the occupiers of factories in which these contrivances have been adopted that they alone form no secure fencing of the shaft. Adequate means must be adopted, either by a permanent casing or other contrivance, against all accidents from a horizontal shaft, and must be applied to aU parts of such shaft to which there may be access while it is revolving." He found, however, that a circular from all the inspectors, issued on the 3d of last March, after his bill had been introduced, contained the following instructions "W We therefore request you to infonr the mill occupiers in your respective districts that we shall continue not to require horizontal shafts above seven feet from the floor to be cased, nor more than the application of rectangular hooks or parallel rods on each side o, every drum, or of any other contrivance equally effectiveforpreventing the driving strap from lapping or coiling upon the shaft. We continue to hold that by suds precautions the shaft, as well as the drum or pulley, is securely fenced." (Hear, hear.) The House must bear in mind that these directions were issued by the same persons who published the letter of the 23d of January, 1855. He put it to the House whether it was right that a large interest like the manufacturing body should be subjected to the contradictory decisions of the factory inspectors. (Hear, hear.) But he had not done with the case. So recently as the first of tlse present mouth r. Homer had pult an advertisement in the Mlanchester papers to the effect, that it WaS a mistake to suppose that the use of rectangular hooks was required by the inspectors, thus reversing the two former decisions, and affording a remarkable illustration of the manner in wfhich the manufacturers were treated. (Hear, hear.) He had been told that his bill was a Lancashire bill. He denied it; but, even if it were, lie did not understand why he should be taunted with doing his duty to his constituents. (Hear, hear.) The fact, however was that his bill was approved by all the manufacturers throughout the country, and he had himself presented petitions mu its favour from almost every part of the united kingdom. Sir John Kincaid, the inspector for Scotland, stated in one of his reports last year that the casing of horizontal shafts above seven feet from the floor was not required in that district. If he were told, therefore, that the manufacturers of Scotland did not object to the law as it now stood, he would reply that it was because they were placed in a very different position from their English brethren; but he was prepared to prove that they were almost unanimously in favour of his bill. He entreated the House to deal with this question in a calm, deliberate manner, and not sufferitself to beledaway by statementsto the effect that his bill was an attempt to get rid of the factory law altogether. It was no such thing. (Hear, hear.) The object of his measure was siniply to place all parts of the gearing and machinery in factories upon the samefooting, making it a question for arbitration -whether they were dangerous or not ; and if the Home Secretary slsould express the opinion, that the clauses of the bill were so framed as to be capable of doing something either more or less, or that the wording was obscure, he would be hapgy to adopt any alterations or amendments which nsight bo suggested. (Hear, hear.) Nay more, he was authorized by the manufacturers of the county which ho represented - and in this they spoke the sentiments of their brethren in al parts of the kingdom-to say that they had no nigardly feeling in the matter whatever, that all they wanted was to have the law fairly interpreted and carried out, that they were prepared to fence off whatever part of their gearing and msachinery the Home Secretary might declare ought to he guarded as being within the reach of the workers, but that they most decidedly objected to being exposed to the contradictory decisions of the inspectors. (Hear, hear.) There was one case which he was bound to mention, even out of its proper place. In one of the mils which he visited durinn the recess, he observed that more than half of the straps that revolved round the drum of the shaft revolved downwards. The danger consequently was, that a person coining in contact with any of the straps might be injured by the machinery below, not that he might be dragged upwards. He asked the owner wfhether he had received any notice from the inspector'> The reply was, "I have not only been under the attention of the inspector, but have received orders to fence all my shafting." So that while the manufacturer was compelled to fence his gearing, from which no danger' might be apprehended, the guarding of his machinery, which suight possiblygive rise to accidents, was a question for arbitration. (EHear, hear.) It was to do away with anomalies of that kind that the present bill had been introduced; and lie conscientiously believed that the Government could support the second reading without endangering the life or limb of a single hunian being. For his own part, he was as anxious as any member of that Houso to protect the lives of the manufacturing operatives, and, if he had thought that the bill would have the effect of increasing the number of accidents in factories, he would not have introduced it ; but lie believed that, after the measure had passed into a law, the life of every factory worker would be as secure as before, and, at any rate, he was willUing to adopt any alteration or amendment that might be deemed necessary to secture that object. But he could not submit to see animportantbodyofhis constituents subjected to a law which they could not obey, and which, if they refused to comply with its impracticable requisitions, rendered them iable to great trouble, inconvenience, and expense. (Hear, hear) The hon. and gallant member concluded by moving the second reading of the bill. Mr. COBBETT, in conformity -with a notice which he had placed on the paper, rosh to move, as an amendment, that the bill be read a second time that day sixmonths. He thought he should be able to show, without occupying too much of the time of the House, that the bill as it now stood would be a most impolitic measure to adopt; that it was calculated to do aU that mischief which its mover had professed himself-and, no doubt, sincerely-anxiousto avoid - and that it would render dangerous to the lives and limbs of an immnense number of people employed in factories that machinery and gearing which the existing law required to be securely fenced. lie hoped the House would remember the distinction drawn by the hon. and gaUant member between mill-gearing and machinery, and that the statute which it was now proposed to mutilate, if not to destroy in its most important parts, was not passed until after the most mature deliberation and inquiry, and after an investigation conducted at the instance of the hon. and gallant gentleman himself. In 1832 Mr. SadUer, a member of that House, obtained a committee to inquire into the condition and work-Ling hours of factorv operatives, especially children. MIr. Sadler was not returned to the Parliament which was elected after the passing of the Reform Billbut the bill which he had founded upon the report of his' committee was introduced by Lord Asbley. Thereupon the hon. and gallant gentleman, who knew that there had been an inquiry by the Sad/er Committee, moved that the bill should form the subject of an investigation by a Royal commission. A commission was accordingly issued by the Crown, and the commissioners addressed to the Secretary of State avery voluminousreport, in which they suggested, for the first time, that some provision should be made in an act of Parliament for securing children and other persons employed in factories against accidents from machinery. They stated a variety of extraordinary facts, showing the necessity for such legislation. At the conclusion of their report, which was laid on the table of the House on the 25th of June, 1883. they said - ' From the evidence collected it appears that, in many of the mills, numerous accidents of a grievous nature do occur to the -workpeople. It appears, also, that these accidents may be prevented, smice insome mil, wrhere more care of the work-people is in general displayed, they are prevented. It appears furtlher, that whilo some manufacturers liberaly contribute to the relief of the sufferers, many other manafacturers leave tlfem to obtain relief from public bounty, or as they may." They proceeded to state that- " The refusal to contribute to the expense of the cure of those who have been maimed is usually founded on the the assertion that the accident was occasioned by culpable heedlessness or temerity. In the cases of the children of tender years we do not consider this a valid defence against the claim for contribution from the employer. We cannot suppose ain obligation to perpetual caution and discretion imposed on children at an age wvhen those qualities do not usually exist. The indiscretion of children must, we consider, be presumed, and gutarded against as a thing that must necessarly, and to a greater or less extent be manifested by all of them." With regard to adults they said:- "But the accidents wvhich occur to the adults are of themselves evidence (unless they were wilfully incurred in a state of delirium) that the individual used al the caution of which he is capable; as it may be presuzmed that the loss of life or limb, or the infdiction of severe pain, would rarely. be wantonly incurred." They then proposed that there should be regulations for the ryevention of accidents, and stated that some manufacturers concurred writh them as to the necessity of that measure. "Some of the manufacturers have proposed that the inspecters, who they think ought to be appointed to insure compliance with any legislative regulation, should have power to inspect the factories, and direct what parts of tho machinery-should be fenced. off, and that after succh directions have been complied with the manufacturer should be relieved freni further responsibility." The comlmissioners added: "We concur in the proposition for giving such power to inspectors, but we not concur in the proposal to relieve the manufacturer from responsibility." The hon. and gallant gentleman, therefore, was the person who originated the idea of a legislative enactment for the prevention of accidents in factories. (Hear, hear.) Nothing could be more deliberate than the proceeding of Parlia. inent. An act-the 3d and 4th William IV.-was passed in 1833, after the report of the cormissioners bad been laid on the table, but no notice was taken at that time of accidents caused bymachinery, nor any provisionsintroduced into the act to prevent them, although they were both of frequent occurrence and serious in their conqequences. In 1841 another committee was appointed to inquire into the subject, and that committee recommended that the ma. chineryin mills should be fenced, and even went into a discussion as to the mode in which it ought to be done. They proposed that uprifht shafts should be boxed, and that orizontal shafts Iess than seven feet from the floor should be guarded in the same manner. The then Secretary of State-the Marquis of Normanbysent the report of the committee to the Factory Inspectors who had been appointed under the act of 1833, with instructions to institute inquiries among owners, managers, machine-makers, operatives, and other persons connected with factories, and to report to him their opinionupon the propositions of the committee. The inspectors immediately went to work, and in the same year presented a special report upon the " practicability of legislative interference to dimi. nauh the frequency of accidents to children." That report showed the great care taken by the inspectors to carry out the instructions of the harquis of Normanby. They exaIminedI lupvards of 100 millowners, managers, surgeons, machine-makers, and operatives, and there was not a single witness called before them who did not say that it was ab. solutely necessary that all vertical shafting, and all horizoutal shafting less than six or seven feet from the ground, should be boxed up in order to prevent accidents. Upon that point all parties were agreed; but in framing a bill great difficulty was experienced in distinguishing that part of the machinery and gearing of a mill which ought to be fenced from that which might safely be left unfenced. The manufacturers were consulted by the inspectors as to the best mode of describing what ought to be done; and it was a fact that the act of 1844 was based upon the definitions given by the masters themselves. That act provided that all mill gearing should be securely fenced. A complaint had been made that it was aslowed to remain in abeyance for a considerable time. There could be no doubt that the act was not immediately brought into force, but the reason was that it had no sooner been passed than large numbers of the factory owners adopted a mode of fencing their machinery and gearing which had been invented for their interest, and therefore the inspectors did not find it necessary to enforce the provisions of the act all at once. It was important to remark that the 21st section of tlhe act did not say that shafting should be left unfenced when 6 or 7 feet from the floor, and so far it differed from the recommendations of the manufacturers. A great deal of mystification had been caused by the use of the words "boxing" and "casing." No such words were to be found in the statute, which simply said that mill gearing should be "securely fenced," leaving the masters to choose their own mode of carrying out that object. He believed that "box" or " case" would be sought for in vain in any one of the reports of the inspectors. For several years after the passing of the act it was not thought necessary to call upon masters to fence horizontal shafting 7 feet from the floor, because it was believed than no danger could arise tothe workpeople fiom gearing in that position; Mr. Saunders, one of the inspectors, going the length of asserting that it was impossible accidents could happen. But when they found that the most horrible accidents were caused by shafting not 7, but S, 9, and even 10 feet from the floor, the inspectors became alarmed; their attention was called to the fact that many of those accidents were owing to their ow-n neglect of duty in not putting the law into force; and at length, in 1854, the then Secretary of State, now the head of the Administration, asked them for an explanation. Upon consulting among themselves they saw that they would be no longer safe in suLffering accidents to happen from revolving shafts 7 or 8 feet from the floor. They accordingly resolved to carry the law into effect, and to call upon the millowners to ",:securely fence" every portion of their gearing, whether above or below 7 feet from the ground. Ain order wa; issued to that effect on the 31st of January, 1854, and one of the first effects was the arrival of a deputation of the manufacturers in London, with the Niew of remonstratinug with the Secretary of State on the subject. One error into which they had fallen was instantly corrected. They said that the mnillovners had received orders to box or case their machinery. It was explained to them that the order was not one to box or case, but, in the words of the statute, to "securely fence" their machinery and gearing. Lord Palmerston received the deputation, wlhich was accompanied by nearly all the members for Lancashire, vith his usual courtesy, and listened with interest to the statements which were mado to hinm. Mr. Gregg, the late 3member for Mlanchester, was the first spea'ker, and he assured the noble lord that accidents could not happen from revolving shafts placed at so great a distance from the floor as 7 feet. One of the Fieldings and MIr. Walker, of Bradford, also addressed the Minister, and they told him that it would be exoitremely inconvenient to the owuers, and even dangerous to the mills themselves, to box up the gearing, but that they were ready to adopt the plan which had been so long in use among the manufacturers of Yorkshire. Now, it was the fashion among the members of the National Association of Millowners, as they called themselves, to sneer at straphool;s and what they term "contrivances" of that sort, and to declare that they would never consent to a compromise. But the strap-hook was no new discovery; it was constantly referred to in the reports of the inspectors, and by the masters themselves, as a very secure mode of fencin"r the shaft as it fell from the drum. Lord Palmerston then coummunicated vith the inspectors, and a second order was issued, distinctly explaining to the factory owners that the former order did not prescribe any mode of fencing, but merely required that the gearing should be securely fenced, leaving the masters to make theirov-n selection. At the same time a sort of recommendation was given by the inspectors that strap-hooks should be used. as if to prove the necessity of something being immediately done, scarcely a week had passed since the deputation to Lord P'alsmerston, when in a mill near Lancaster, belonging to a brother of MIr. Gregg;-the gentleman whio declared that no accident could happen from shafting 7 feet from the floor-a man had one of his arms taken off and the other broken by an accident which might have been prevented by a strap-hook. Shortly aftenvards-in February, 1854-he received the following letter from one of his constituents at Oldham:- " 29, North Bloor, Oldham, Feb. 20, 1854. "Sir,-Iwish to lay before your notice a misfortune that happened to a young man of the name of Thomas Schofield, while in the employ of the North Moor lUill Company, Oldliam, by which he bad his rightarm torn offand his left arm broken in two places and dislocated at theshoulder, on the 10th of September, 1852, for which he was under Dr. Iowtin of Oldam until May 2, IS83. If the shaft of the machinery bad been guarded the misfortune could not have happened. "To J. M. Cobbett, Esq., M.P1" He immediately called at the office of the factory inspectors, and there, for the first time in his Ife, saw Mir. Horner, to whom he put a question on the subject. .r. Horner turned to the surgeon's report, from which it appeared that not only had the accident referred to taken place, but the young man had sustained several contusions and bruises not described in the letter. He regretted to say that accidents of an even more serious character had occurred in factories belonging to members of that House, and, although it was painful to him to recite the particulars in the presence of those gentlemen, yet he thought it would be 'oetter to do so before their faces than behind their backs. Last year a most shocking accident took place in the mill of the bon. member for South Lancashire, who, if not a member of the National Association, was, at all events, one of the deputation to Lord Palmerston when the noble viscount was assured that no danger could be apprehended from gearing placed 7 feet above the floor. The accident wasafatalone. Luke Carter, aged 18 years, a minder of a self-acting mule, was the person who was killed. The principal strap which worked the mil had broken, and the unfortunate man was holding it, while a person named WFilliam Oates was piecing it, the strap being slipped off the drum on to the horizontal shaft. Luke Carter at the time was standing on the fuDer of the mule, which was 6 feet from the shaft; he suddenly became entangled -with the strap, and was taken up, the strap embracing his head close to the shaft, and his body revolving vith tremendous rapidity; his legs were both torn off below the knee, coming in contact with a steam pipe which ran the whole length of the room, 4 inches in diameter and l inch thick, which was broken to pieces, his arms, ribs, and, in fact, the whole of his body being beaten almost to pulp. Several pieces of bone and flesh were found in the room after the principal part of the corpse had been removed. He was quite dead when the shaft was stopped. The shaft was 8 feet 5A incbes from the floor. Mr. e'oles, the sub-inspector, was directed by the inspector to investigate the case, and his report was confirmatory of that of the surgeon, adding that "the shaft was not cased, had no strap-hooks, nor any other contrivance to prevent the strap from falling on the shaft and lapping round it, which, if there bad been, the accident could not have happened." That was a case in which there was no strap-hook, and if one had been attached to the drum of the shaft there was little or no probability of such an accident occurring. In that case the body of the unfortunate sufferer was reduced to a mere quivering mass of flesh, and it was actually necessary to get shoveis to place it in baskets and remove it in that manner. A case so frightful it was difficult to conceive and yet it would have been prevented by the use of straphooks. That case was brought before the magistrates under the penalty clause, by which factory owners were liable to be fined for not having horizontal shafts securely fenced, and was dismissed on the ground that the shaft was that height from the ground at which it was said that no accident could happen There -was another case with which he would trouble the House. He read in the Wigan Observer, on October the 20th, 1855, that:- " On Weldnesday last an inquest was held at the house of Mr. Sutherland, the Victoria, Inn, Pemberton, before Charles Edward Duffield, Esq., coroner, on the body of a young man named Michael Lacev. The deceased, when alive, resided in Princess-street in this town, but went to work at the new mill in Pemberton, which is occupied by Messrs. Gibbons and Brown, cotton spinners. The accident depriving the young man of his life occurred about 3 oclock on Monday afternoonlast. He was employed as jobber, and ras in the act of standing on a ladder holding a strap off a shaft while a man named John Daley was tightening 14 at the end of the frame. A girl who was minding a frame in the same alley was eating apples, and zo was deceased. .Some other girls had been 3oking with him, askin- for apples, when the young man threw a stalk at them. While he waa thus reaching over his shirt sleeve was caught by the shaft, which performs 160 revolutions per minute, wrapped deceased's arm round and took- his body off the ladder Tht, Iunfortunate young mans head was taken off and throw n about seven yards distant from the placeo where the zest, of his body felL. The left leg and an were cut off. ant the right leg was also broken off about the shin bone. Th", right arm remained attached to the trunk, and it was btnk-en in several illaces. The remains had a truly frig,htfvil appearance. 'There was no blame said to attach to any on ac0unt of the occurrence, The jury returnei a verdict of ' Accidental death."' It 'was said that in, t1bS case the-re was culpable ueglecb on the part of the unfortunateyoung wan; but sorelyit was only in accordance with reason that persons who used dangerous machinery should use even more precaution than masters generally were bound to take by law for the safety of tho-se in their employ; and Lord Campbell in the Court of Queen's Bench bad decided that masters were bound to use the best precaution known at the time. It was unreasonable to expect that even adults should preserve such strict attention durina the whole time that they were employed, and in t;e case which he had read the neglect of the young man was not so culpable that his life should have been risked. Another accident had happened in the milU of the hon. member for Manchester, by which the arm of a boy, who was putting a strap upon a. shaft, was torn off and his body shoetigly mutilated; and these were accidents which had happened in mills where the shafts were more than 7 feet from the floor. Sinmce the House had adjourned for the Easter recess a dreadful accident had occurzed in Bradford to a young man about 16 years of age. He was employed at the mill of Messrs. Addison and Sons, and, in the absence of the overlooker, he was attempting to put a strap upon the drum of a horizontal shaft while the shaft was running at full speed. Either from want of expertness, or from a slip, the strap missed the drum and fell upon the shaft. Instantly the strap coiled orlapped around the shaft, and dragged the lad round with awu rapidity dashing him scores of times against the top of the room, or against the articles within reach, before the terror-strickena people at work in the room could run out to stop the engine. In this mill the owners had complied with the law in affixing the strap-hook generally, but in the particular drum where this accident happened this precaution had been overlooked, being quite an exception to the rest of the fencing apphed to theirhorizontal shafts. Hfad the straphook been placed to the drum in question, the strap would have fallen from the young man's hand upon the hook and remained still and quite harmless. One of this firm had been requested by such millowners as had joined the Lancashire League or Association to proceed to London in support of the present bill. But it was needless to say that lie was fully convinced that not a single drum running upon a horizontal shaft should remain without the strap-hook or parallel rod, whether in Yorkshire or Lancashire, or any rat of the united kingdom. These cases afforded to uis mind ample proof that horizontal shafts should be fenced in some way or another, and the inspectors of factories, the majority of the masters of factories, and the operatives themselves, were of opinion that straphooks would afford a great protection against accident. They had already been adopted by a large proportion of the millowners in Scotland, in Lancashire by nearly one-half of them, while in Yorkshire the adoption of them was the rule, and the absence of them the exception; would the House, then, consent to pass a bill in order to relieve a small minority of the manufacturers of the kingdom from the necessity of any fencing? When it was found that millowners were goinlg on from day to-day fencing, would that House interpose to release them from an obligation which they seemed desirous of fulfilling ? Under the Factories Act, 1844, by the 43d clause, power was given to the inspectors to give notice to owners if they considered machinery dangerous, but it gave them no further power; and, in point of fact, after they had done so, the mnlouwner night snap his fingers at them. If an inspector gave such notice, it was provided that the matter should be referred to arbitration, and then what was called an award was made ; but the millowner might please him,self entirely about paying any attention to it; and would the House consent to placing mill-gearing on a similar footing? The hon. and gallant gentleman had moved for a return of the number of arbitrations which had taken place; but if he had asked for a return of the number of notices which had been given and taken no notice of, he would have found the number very much greater. The case had happened of an inspector applying for penalties in a case where an accident had occurred after notice had been given ; and what had been the result? Why the factory master proved that subsequent to the receipt of the notice and prior to the accident some alteration had been made in the machinery; and it was held thattthat alteration invalidated the notice. Now, it was impossible to identify machinery in all its parts, and thus by making some slight alteration the law couldbe evaded. In another case, the receipt of a notice was acknowledged by a millowner in a note in which he said, "If the markets do not improve, Ishall lock up notoulythe part of the machinery complained of, but the mill itself, and if any of the humanity-mongers like to take it they may." The bill of the hon. and gallant -entleman would remove all the dangerous shafting and miffgearing from the 43d clause to the 21st, anid the result would be that no protection would be afforded to the operatives. Noow, how would an inspector of factories go to Work under the bil if it passed into law? What was he to do? Why, it would be his clear duty to give notices in all those cases of dan-erous mill-gearing, andthe number of notices would beprodigiousin fact, absurd. If the inspector neglected giving notice, and an accident occurred, he could not enforce the penalty against the mioowner, and thus persons would be deprived of their contingent rights. The inspector, therefore, if he did his duty, would be compelled to give all these notices, and when given there would be no power to enforce compliance with them. Now, should such a state of things be sanctioned by that House? The question was one which involved the interests of a large portion of the community, and he, as one of the representatives of a place the inhabitants of which were largely engaged in manufacturing pursuits, had felt it his duty to rise and enter into these details, painful as they were, with the view of endeavouring to dissuade the House from giving its consent to a measure which w.ould have the effect of removing all precaution against the frequent occurrence ef accidents so dreadfull, and for the reasons which he had stated he begged to move that the bill be read a second time that day six months. (Hear, hear.) Lord J. MANINERS rose to second the amendment. If he could agree with his hon. and galant friend, that under the present bill there would be no more liability to danger than under the existing system, he would not be inclined to oppose it, but unfortunately he held an entirely opposite opinion. Iis hon. and gaUant friend had stated that doubts existed as to what was required by the law; but in his opinion the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench had entirely removed those doubts. He was gLad that the question of expense had not been introduced, for the expense of making this mill-gearing safe would be too trifling to be worthy of mention in that house. His hon. and gallant friend appeared to think little of the accidents which had occurred (7" No, no !" from Colonel Patten); but they appeared to take place in about the ratio of one a-month, and that being the case, ought that House to go baclk-wards from the course which it had adopted, with a view of preventing these accidents, simply because some of the manufacturers of the country Lonsideredall inteiference withthem objectionable? The bill would onlytendto introduce doubt where none at present existed; and he urged upon the House that they should not reopen the whole of the factory question, because he n-as persuaded that the object sought for in the bill before the House was only one step in the direction of ulterior measures which the association that urged it forward had in view. (Hear, hear.) Mr. GIBSON said that one reason why he thoupght that the House should support the second reading of the bill was precisely because it did not reopen the whole of the factory question, but would enable the factory law to be carried into effect. (Hear, hear.) He believed that the factory operatives would be in a better position than they were at present if the bill, which dealt with a specific evil complained of, were passed. Mr. Horner, one of the inspectors of factories, reported in August, 1855, that he was satisfied that the main requirements of the law had been well carried out in his district; but, with regard to thefencing of horizontal shafts, he expressed his regret that the lawwasnot observed. It was difficult, however, to observe the law when no one knesv what the law was. (Hear, hear.) Judges and inspectors differed as to n-hat was meant by " secure fencing," and it was to the credit of the Millowners Association that they hadeondeavoured to obtain an exact interprotation of the lav. One decision which had been given was, that al mil gearing should be protected; but MIr. Homner had declared that all mil gearing could not be protected-that drums for instance could not be protected. Amid such diversity of opinion who should decide? Clearly the natural and simple way was to refer all matters in dispute to arbitrators, who should determine between the manufacturers on the one hand and the operatives on the other. The bill under consideration provided for arbitration in such cases; and for that, among other reasons, he should give it his support. (Hear, hean) Sir G. GREY believed that the bill before the House was not calculated to remove any practical protection from factory operatives; but the question raised by the biU was whether there was not an impossibility in carrying out the law as laid down by the Court of Queen's Bench, and uhether there was not an uncertainty with respect-to the interpretation of the law which required the interposition of Parliament. He apprehended that in passing the present act the intention of Parliament simply was, that all machinery which involved danger to operatives should be securely fenced; but, unfortunately, the act did not define what was meant by " securely fencing." The words ;;casing" and "boxing' were frequently used instead of fencing ," but clearly they had not the same meaning, because itmight be quite sufficient to fence certain portions while other portions required to be cased or boxed. Ho (Sir 0. Grey) had received a large deputation of manufacturers upon this subject, and they complained that they were liable to be the victims of tile diversity of opinion which the inspectors mightt entertain. To meet that difficulty, he (Sir G. Grey) had asked the four inspectors to agree and set down in wrtinz what they considered to be a compliance with the law. He must say, however, that under the law as it stood it inflicted an inconvenience upon millowners to which they ought not to be subjected. There were drums and pulleys which it waS impossible to fence; but he thought that the proposed bllm went beyond any proved necessity, and that, if carried, it would deprive the operatives of the protection to which they were justly entitled. (Hear, hear.) It was evident that horizontal shafts, revolving at a height from the floor of seven feet, could be dangerous to no one, while the straps by which the shaft was driven really were dangerous; and of cburse it wvas desirable that that portion of the machinery which was dangerous, and near to which young persons were likely to pass, should be protected. The hon. and learned member for Oldham had made on observation which was worthy of consideration, and that was, that of the arbitrator, who was supposed to be a cmpetrnt person, determined that danger existed, owing to the absence of safeguards, it should not be left optional with the millowner to take precautions or not at his pleasure, but that he should be liable to severe penalties if he dtd not do so. A provision to that effect ought, he thought, to be introduced into the hill. If his hon. and ga ant friend would consent to some modifications in his neasure he (Sir G. Grey) would undertake to arrange with- him sueh alterations as might be necessary, and would not object to the second reading of tho bill; because he thought that arbitration afforded the readiest and most satisfactorymeaus of settling all those 9uestions with reference to maohiner;and mill gearing which at present occasioned eo much dispute, and led to so much ill-feeling. Moreover, if that system were adopted, he believed that thero woul' be a *more general concurrence in carrying into ell&t.the real spirit of the Factory Act. (Heor, hear.)

THE SUICIDE OF M3. SADLEIR, JI.P. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The article in your journal of this day entitleS " . Curious Speculation" calls for some examinatiou% not on account of the reasoning of the writer in the Nation, though "he declares his deliberate conviction, that there exist reasons of a reliable character for believing that Mr. John Sadleir has not committed suicide," but from the fact of your countenancing the statement by its insertion. Before the question assumes any more defihite shape, it is desirable to examine the evidence on -which it is raised. 1. The letters referred to are dated on the day preceding the suicide, and not "a full week before,"'as. stated. The reasoning founded on this allegation, therefore, falls tD. the ground. 2. The rule referred to in Parke and FnnbAznques Mediet Jurispractence does not apply to the ease-of a body exposed to the actior. of cold on a bteak heath on a frosty night, but to the enlinary instance of-a person dying ihn bed. 3.

Sir,-I trast you vill permnit the translator of- IL de Montalembert's work, in reply to the letter of that gentleman and of Mr. Hayward's in to-day's Timer, to say that I shal be sorry if I find that I have mistrwLslated any portion. of the work. I may have done so, for certainly I found soine passages obscure and entortillts; but I can honestiy say that I endeavoured to accomplish my tasi -with the most conscientious impartiality, and that if there be any errors they are are not, as MIessrs. Hayvward and Montaleiu. bert seem to insinuate, intentional. My translation was afterwards overlooked by auother and more experienced eye, who corrected a few phrases, bat made no change, that I am sensible of, in the'meaning. It would be too much to expect Y7U Tinmes to make roomr for such a discussion; but if 3Mr. Hayvard will take tl-e trouble to communicate to Mr. Murray what he or M do Montalembert conceive to be erroneous in my version I shall endeavour to satisfy them; but till then I must persist in maintaining, not the ability, but the general correctness, and, above all, the good faith of my translation.

LONYDONT, THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 1W6. In the IHouse of Commons yesterday, on the order for going into committee upon the Medical Profession Bill, Lord R. GROSVENOR called attention to the peculiar position im which thi bill stood, notice having been given of nearly 100 anmendments-some of them going to the whole principle of the measureat so late a period that there had not been time to considerthem. He recommended Mr. HEADbLAM, (who had charge of the bill) not to force on a discussion, but to postpone the committee. 3Ir. BARPow concurred in this suggestion. Mr. ED5ADLr declined to accede to this proposal, on account of the inconveniences that would result from delay, and because there was not the slightest hope that delay.would lead to an approximation of the discordant opinions respecting the constitution of the Medical Council, the majority of the members of which, the Government now proposed, shouId be nominated by the CPaow^z. This was the most important of the amendments; the rest were mosty verbal. MrZk. WAnrsn called attention to the 62d amendment, which asserted a very serious principle. It proposed to render any person who should, by him|self or deputy, prescribe or administer medicines for gain or reward, without being duly registered, liable to a penalty of not less than 5i. This was, he said, a matter far too important to be treated as a mere verbal amendment; it would be better that this most serious question should be decided before going into conmittee. Mr. Mscnn was favourable to the general principle of the bill, but objected to certain of its details. Sir G. GREY explained the reasons :why the Government amendments had not been announced earlier, and suggested that it would be better to go at once into conmmittee, and discuss the question as to the constitution of the Medical Council. MIr. IALYroLE observed that this question related to the most important principle of the bill, and the alteration of that principle at the eleventh hour was a reason for postponing the committee. He suggested to Mr. Hnr.ALA.Nr to consider whether the bill, or the subject, should not be referred to a Select Committee. He moved, by way of amendment, that the order for committing the bill be postponed until Wednesday next. After a somewhat long discussion the House divided, when the amendment was carried by 116 to 81. Mlr. HPaiDL,r complained that the Government, by proposing their amendment at the last moment, had thrown him over, and he now left the bill in their hands. Sir G. GRCEY stated the reasons which had induced the Government at first to decline the conduct of such a measure, and he now, on their part, declined to take charge of this bill, or to bring in another upon the subject. Mr. WAiaoxE recommended Mr. IEADLor not hastily to abandon the bill, but to consent to refer it to a Select Committee. Some firther conversation resulted in nothing more than the postponement of the committee until Wednesday next. ColonelNV. PATrmE, in moving the second reading of the Factories Bill, re-stated its object-namely, to remedy certain alleged grievances and oppressions to which owners of factories were subjected under the law asit stood, by placing the gearing and shafting of mill-machinery upon the same footing as the machinery itself. The peculiar hardships suffered by manufacturers undera law wlhich was of an exceptional character were, he said, aggravated by the number of contradictory decisions by the factory inspectors upon the subject of fencing, which rendered it difficult to know what the law really was. He pressed the House to look fairly and temperately at the measure, which was not, as had been suggested, an attempt to get rid of the factory law. Mr. CossTrr moved to defer the second reading for six months, arguing that the measure was one which it woould be impolitic in the House to pass, inasmuch as it would endanger the lives and limbs of people employed in factories, by diminishing the securities provided by the existing lawf for~ the guarding and fencing of machinery. The 21 st section of the act of 18944the main part of which this bill would virtually repeal-had been intro- duced, he said, at the instance of the millowners' themselves. Be defended the factory inspectors, and accounted for the apparent incongruity of their decisions, which was owing to accidents resulting from mill gearing and revolving shafts above 7 feet from the floor. He read the details of some fearful accidents caused by the absence of fencing from high horizontal shafts, and contended that the want of caution on the part of workpeople did not absolve the owner from blame, and all the inspectors had done was to enforce the fencing of these parts of the machinery, which this bill would render no longer obligatory. The provision in the bill that the wvord " machinery" in the 43d section of the act of 1844 shall apply to mill gearing of every description would, he contended, afford an insufficient protection, that section being now evaded. Lord J. LAh-NRs cordially seconded this amendment, believing that no doubts under the existing law required to be removed, and not convinced that the liability to danger wrould not be increased by passing this bill, which would re-open the whole of this great question. Mr. Mi. Ginsox said one reacon for the second reading of this biU, in his opinion, was precisely because it did not re-open the whole factory question, but carried that law into full effect, securing the cooperation of all parties interested, and placing the operatives in a better position. Judges, as well as inspectors, differed in their construction of the present law; so that it was no wonder that it was not observed. The bill proposed that the law should be carried out, not at the will of either millowners or inspectors, but by the impartial decision of arbitrators. He should give his cordial support to the bill. Sir G. G=RY agreed that the question did not involve the general principle of the factory law, and that, unless the present law could be satisfactorily enforced, it ought to be relaxed. The real question raised by the bill was, he said, whether there was not a practical impossibility of enforcing the present law, and an uncertainty respecting its requirements which required the interference of Parliament. It could not be denied, he thought, thatthere wis an uncertainty in the law. It had not been determined what "secure fencing " was, and this uncertainty created a difliculty in complying with the law as it had been laid down by the Court of Queen's Bench. At the same time, he thought the bill went beyond any proved necessity, and that it would, in its present state, deprive the operatives of the protection to which they were entitled. If Colonel PATTE:-r would consent to such modifications of the bill, which he (Sir GEo1GE) undertook to arrange with him, as would place all the mill gearing now subject to dispute under the 43d section of the act 7th and 8th of VicroitiA, he should feel it his duty not to object to the second reading of the bill. Lord STA.xN-=, on the part of Colonel PATTmf and on his own behalf, consented to adopt the modifications proposed by Sir G. GiEY. He replied to objections offered to the bill. Mr. HARDY said Sir G. GREY'S proposition would leave the question as it was before. The whole question between the miHowners and the inspectors was as to the horizontal shafts. The difliculty of deciding what was " secure fencing" was the very reason why inspectors were appointed. The law was said to be uncertain; but the Court of Queen's Bench had determined that it was definite and clear. If not, a short bill might require the use of specific safeguards. MIr. Mvurz thought the wisest plan was to let the law rest as it was, but to make an exception with respect to horizontal dru ms and shafts. Mr. CnEBTrHA and Mr. BROTHERTOw having spoken in support of the bill, Colonel DuNN3s moved that the debate be adjourned. Upon a division this motion was negatived by a large majority; but, as it now wanted only a few minutes to 6 o'clock, the debate, according to a rule of the House, stood adjourned. The other orders of the day having been disposed of, the House adjourned.
The House of Conimons spent a considerable time yesterday in discussing a measure presumed to be of some importance, and therefore important to be passed. It might be called a declaratory bill for distinguishing what parts of the machinery in factories are to be considered dangerous, and for thereby saving unnecessary trouble and expense, securing the co-operation of millowners, and settling a long dispute. The House had shown itself favourable to the measure, so much so that the opponents thought they had no chance for the present, if they let the House proceed to a division on the next step-viz., the second reading. So Colonel Duxs-s moved that the debate be adjourned. Thereupon, with due formality and much consumption of time, the House divided on the question of adjournment, and decided by a large majority on no account to adjourn, but to proceed at once to a division on the second reading. On this decision being reported to the SPR&xmt, and announced by him, that functionary took counsel of the clock, and informed the House that, according to its own rule, the debate now stood adjourned, it being contrary to rule to divide so late as 10 minutes to 6. Colonel Duz-N therefore triumphed over the House by the aid of its own rules. It appears, indeed, that anybody who wishes the postponement of a Wednesday's debate has only to calculate the time taken up by such a moderate speech as he nay be able to deliver, and the further time occupied by a division, and he will be able to put the Houso in the position it was in yesterday at 10 minutes to 6. He can let it take a victory it can make no use of. We will not now enter into the merits of yesterday's question, or consider how far Colonel DuxN-'s manceuvre is likely to gain him allies. Whlat strikes us as more important is the bondage under which the House seems to have laid itself by this bit of MvIede andPersian law. The King of BAB-%roN found himself compeUled, much against his will, to throw his dear friend and faithful servant into a den of lions because that friend had unfortunately incurred the penalty of a law to which the KING bad given his inconsiderate sanction. The British House of Commons having sho-wn a decided partiality for a measure, and a strong desire to proceed with it, found itself arrested by one of its own rules, which the crafty foe had, unawares, thrown in its way. Half-a-day was thus lost for want of five minutes, or rather for want of the power to act independent of the clock. Colonel Dmuiiu acted the part of those people often found in common life, who combine the distinct qualities of flivolity and punctuality. They first kill time by spending it in nothing, and then, producing I their watches, tell us it is too late, and we must go and kill thne elsewhere. This is not the only recent instance of GL servile adherence to rule. Twenty-four hours' after peace had been proclaimed at Paris and London, and when the House of Commons, having just flocked up from the Easter recess, felt the greatest anxiety to know some particulars of the result, Lord PALmERSTON happened not to be in his place just at the very moment when, the petitions having been presented, members might ask questions, before the House proceeded to the Orders of the Day. It was owing to the natural im- I patience of the House on this one point that nobody had a question to ask about anything else; so in three minutes the House passed to the Orders of the Day, and was immediately deep in the repairs and alterations of Royal Palaces, i parks, and public buildings. Scarcely, how- | ever, had fifty words been uttered when Lord ! PALMERSTON came in and e-xpressed by mute gestures his annoyance that the opportunity had; passed for the most gratifying announcement England had had to receive for many a long year. The law of the Medes and Persians prevailed, and Lord P3M1ERsToN sat like SABRINA on her chair for somehours,'till an opportunity occurred for opening his mouth on a subject which, no doubt, was in his mouth all the while, and in everybody's mouth. The whole of that time any member might occupy the House for an hour in listeningc to the overflowings of his foolish brain, or might ! divide the House about anything, or nothing, with a full knowledge that he would be beaten; but the PRE,IER and leader of the House could not interfere to announce the pacification of Europe. ! Such is the bondage under which the House has laid itself; so little power has it of binding and loosing even on the greatest occasions, for the highest purposes, and where a mere rule of convenience is concerned. N'What is to be said of this ? That there should be no rules, no standing orders, or none that may not be broken through whenever they are found in the way,-that is, whenever they answer their purpose? This certainly is what we do not mean as we are sufficiently aware of the importance of rules. Yet the cause of order and method is not advanced, but the contrary, by a system of literal and rigorous interpretation. Only a few weeks j ago Lord PALMERSTON objected to a rule for closing the debate at midnight, on the ground that towards that witching hour any member might do, in the midst of the most serious debate, wlhat was commonly done on Wednesday afternoon on thei minor questions referred to that weekly opportunity. Any member might look at the clock, and, timing his operations properly, might always manage to throw a measure over 12 o'clock into the next day, andc perhaps the next session. This proceeded on theI assumption, which appears to be a correct one, that the House will not relax its rules for any consider- ation, and will suffer any inconvenience to itself and| to the nation, rather than modify the application of a rule. This is as much slavery as it is possible for a self-imposed restraint to become. There arel persons of whom it is commonly said that they areI perfect slaves to some theory, or some custom, or I some school, or some person. The secret of power, indeed, is self-command; but self-command does not consist in a slavish adherence to rules, multiplied till they take away all exercise of the judgment and all freedom of action. A man who eats, drinks, and sleeps by clock-work, who walks by the sun, and changes his clothes by the almanac, becomes a machine, and is no longer a reasonable being. In this instance could not the House of Commons reserve its discretion, even while it has rules and maintains them ? Why shouldi not the SPEAKER have the power to let the House proceed to a division on a debate, when time has been lost, and the fatal hour is approaching, merely through some mischievous attempt to trip up the heels of the House by its own rules? Of course, the SPEARER must regard alI members with an equal eye, and see neither1 mischief nor folly in any proceeding; but he i might, at least, have some liberty of allowing the House to proceed to a vote or a division when a day would be gained thereby. As it is, we may say of the House of Commons, as of the Groves of Blarney, " None for regulation can with; "it compare." It is so well and so abundantly| regulated that the slightest accident clogs its machinery and throws it out of gear. It. is a watch with the works of a chronometer, which would do well enough if always in uniform temperature and always suspended just one way, but will not stand the rough usage of a pocket and the vicissitudes of every-day life. Yesterday the House suffered in effect a species of epilepsy, being robbed of all movement, all power of action, and suddenly brought to a standstill, in spite of the most decided will. In the -very act of deciding to proceed wsith a debate by a majority of 1981 to 9, it found itself unable so to proceed, and obstructed and choked by a small impediment in the shape of Colonel DUtasx and eight other members. As we have observed, this is not an isolated case. It is becoming the habit of the HIouse, and we submit that it is morbid, and ought to be cured, if a remedy can be found.
The House of Commons, in cominittee on Mr. HEADLAat's Medical Bill yesterday, was like an army in an enchanted forest-lost, bewildered, helpless. It knew not which way to turn, and at every turn there seemed to be a host of adversaries. Amendments sprang up on all sides; airy tongues that syllable men's names urged this member forward and frightened that member back; it was proposed to do this and that, and nobody knows what; here was an amendment of a clause suggested by one favourable to the bill, and it was found to destroy the very principle of the measure; here were half a hundred proposals, each of whch, in like manner, destroyed the characte* of the measure; here vas the promoter of the bill himself eager as any to doctor his own rickety bantling. The Government Lad led our legislators into the jungle by too complacent a patronage of Mr. HEAD"-Nf s scheme, and they were obliged to get out of it as best they could. They had recoursetothat mniaeulous expedient by which our deliberative assemblies get out of all difficulties. In old romance the sorcerer waves his wand, burns a powder, utters a charmthe danger vanishes, and the vision is no more. The Abracadabra of the House of Commaons, which clears every doubt and saves every member, is a reference to a select committee. The committee takes all the responsibility, redeems all the pledges, annuls all the votes, lightens all the consciences, and enlightens all the darkness of the House, and to that wonderful contrivance the Medical Bill of Mr. HEADLAAs is to be given up. Practically the bill, postponed until next Wednesday, when it will be referred to a select committee, is lost, and we have nothing more to do with it. There are few of the medical profession, and still fewer of the general public, who will regret this result. Good in its object, but false in its principle, and absurd in almost every detail, it was not to be expected that the measure should pass into law. Now that the bil is thus disposed of, it'may scarcely appear worth while to dwell on any of its details, and yet the fact that these have been already proposed suggests the fear that they may be proposed again. If there is one clause more absurd than another, it is thatwhich prescribes the manner in which the representative members of the Council are to be elected. The constitution of that Council was bad enough, but absurdity had gone to its extreme limit in the choice of those who were to elect it. There was, in reality, to have been no choice whatever: the Council was to be elected by the universal suffrage of those who have anything to do with medicine, of the ambiguous apothecary who ekes out an existence by the sale of grocery as well as drugs, of the surgeonwhocarrieson thecdouble trade of jeweller and dentist, not less than of the Physician to the QusmEL or of the most distinguished Professor of Anatomy. The lowest grade of the profession was, in fact, to have an equal vote with the highest. Nowv, the most important function of the proposed Council was to establish and maintain a high standard of examinations. How, we should like to know, would this function be exercised by a body elected by individuals the majority of whom would have a direct interest in the lowest possible standard ? We confess that at least in one department we are not disposed to place much confidence in examinations, however strict. There is so much of guesswork in medicine-the President of the College of Physicians is so nearly on a level Nith the meanest herbalist-the result of the longest, most varied, and most profound medical experience is so often a discovery of the worthlessness of medicine, that we are not able to attach overwhelming importance to examinations in this department of the science. But surgery is different; there all is capable of demonstration, and an examination can really test a candidate's knowledge. Medieine is, in truth, surgery at fault, and the difference between the two is precisely the difference that there is between mathematics and metaphysics. The one is plain anid palpable, the other purely speculative. But, even taking this low ground with regard to examinations-even admitting, aswe do, that the reliable facts in medicine are very few and very simple-that the experience of a cele- I brated physician, who said at the close of his life, " When I began to practise I had a dozen cures for "every disease; now I have one remedy for a "dozen diseases," conveys a true estimate of wnat the mnedical schools have to teach-we have not the slightest doubt that under the guardian- ship of a'Council elected in great measure, as, Mr. HEADLA.r proposed, by universal suffrage, thle standards of examination would dwindle year by year, until they reached a renuity suited to the capacities of every pillvendor and corncutter in the kingdom. And the result of all would be, that instead of a modest and intelligent confession of ignorance, such as the highest medical authorities now make, we should have quacks with a boastful profession of omniscience. The fact is, and the House of Commons, we suppose, have recognized it by this time with regard to medicine, that restrictive legislation is the most difficult thing in the world. We shall be glad to see a proper measure introduced into Parliament to regulate the medical profession, and, if possible, to raise the standard of its qualifications; but we confess that we cannot entertain the hopes which many of the abettors of such a measure seem to indulge in as to the effects of an adequate law on the restriction of quackery and heresy. If any man is so foolish as to swallow quack pills and to anoint himself with quack ointment, who in the world is to prevent him, and wvhy in the world should he be prevented? How is it possible to put down the village bonesetter and the old woman with her sinples? It is, indeed, not much that the law can do in the way of prohibition; it can forbid the sale of poisons, and provide that articles not poisonous shall not be deleterious through adulteration. Tlhat is niearly all. Any restriction that would go much beyond this would in the end defeat itself. The really effective portion of any medical biU will be, not that which is negative, but that wvhich is positive,-not that which prohibits, but that which establishes. To fine quacks and confiscate quack medicines will not go far to exalt medical science or to promote the health of the community; to raise the character of the recognized practitioner, to make his examinations more searching and his position more honourable, to hold out the prizes only to such as have passed through a proper training, and have deserved a proper license,-these more positive enactments will do far more for the elevation of the profession and the sanitary condition of the public. One of the rocks, indeed, on which this Medical Bill has shipwrecked was the determination of its promoters to render its prohibitions as stringent as possible-so stringent indeed, according to an amendment pro- posed by MIr. B3PRADY, that one is tempted to believe the real object of the bill was not its ostensible one-the better education of the practitioners of medicine-but something far more pleasant-a miracle which, as St. PATRaICK sent all the vipers and toads from Ireland, would send aU quacks and unlicensed practitioners to prison. As lawyers have a license over our property, and the clergy over our souls, Mr. BnaY wished his profession to have an eiclusive license over our bodies, so that no one out of the fraternity should have a right to administer a single dose, or so much as feel a man's pulse. Happily, there is no danger of such a monopolyas this being established. The mere mention of the proposed clause was sufficient to send it, and the bill it belonged to, far on its way to that safe limbo-a Select Committee.
For a quarter of a century -we have been engaged in liberal legislation. E3very rule, custom, and opinion of our forefathers has been called in question by theorizing or thoroughly practical innovators. But if the question be asked what institution of the State has been most fearlessly assailed and most unsparingly remodelled, it must be answered that the law of England, suich as it was in the days of ELDoN and EuLLEBOROUGH, has been the chief victim of a reformiing age. Whatever may be the present conplaints of the laf's uncertainty and delay, it may be assumed that we live at a time Iwhen the credit, and even the worldly success, of a lawyer is invo'lved in his lending much of his time and talents to remove burdens and expense, I to obviate litigation, and prevent delay in the I redress of wrongs. The great minds which have mastered the theories of English jurispruldence may be occupied in simplifying the elaborate science which it has been the work of years to acquire; but it is doubtful whether the most widespread benefits have not been conferred by those who have worked at the humbler tasl; of bringing cheap and speedy justice to every man's door. Experience has proved what any one of common discernment might suppose-that cases involving questions of law or even a tissue of complicated'facts are rare when compared with the numberless transactions between man and man. It is equally undoubted that the cases in which large sums are at stake are but few, and that the vast majority of the sums involved in actions and the debts contracted in a country are of small individual amount,-. that, in fact, where a claim is made the reason that it is not satisfied is, in a hundred instances to one, because the debtor cannot or will not pay. It was by such considerations that a few years since the Legislature was induced to establish County Courts. The success of tllese new tribunals was immediate and complete. It soon became evident that hundreds of claims had never been urged, and that vast sums had been lost to honesty and industry, through the expense, delay, and uncer-. tainty of the superior courts. The self-reform to which the latter afterwards stibmitted has only partially restored to them the business which found its way to a more ready, though less august judgment seat. The County Courts are now the most popular tribunals in the country. We see that Justices of the Queen's Bench and Barons of the Exchequer enter even the populous towns of the north to fmd only some half-dozen cases for decision on the Civil Side. Trumpets and javelinmen accompany them as of yore, special jurymen are summoned, but the only duty of the second Judge is now to assist his colleague in delivering the county gaol. It cannot be wondered that the local courts, having been found efficient in small things, should yearly receive large and more important trusts. It may be worth while to recaU the history of these tribunals. The most eminent and persevering of our law reformers, Lord BnouGHAx, recommended their establishment more than 20 years ago. But the time was not yet come, and it was not till the year 1846 that England was divided into districts, and Judges were appointed with a jurisdiction in cases involving not more than 201. Certain fees were payable to the Judges, but the CtowN had power to grant salaries not exceeding 1,2001. in lieu of fees. The projectors of the new law had little notion of its effects. It was soon found that the fees, in some districts would amount to a very large income, and the Government accordingly took advantage of the clause which empowered it to fix the salaries at from 1,000L. to 1,200!. In another year jurisdiction in insolvency cases was transferred from the County Commissioners to the new Judges, and they were declared incapable of sitting in Parliament. In 1850 their jurisdiction was extended to 50., and in some cases they were empowered to try titles to real, estate. Further duties devolved on them by acts passed in the two following years; and at length, in 1852, they vere debarred from practising their profession, and their salaries were, in compensation, raised to 1,2001. as a mninimum, and 1,5001. as a vwxi mum. This is their present position with regard to emolument; but scarcely a year has passed without some addition to the number and importance of their duties. Besides deciding ninetynine-hundredths of the actions for debt in the country, they have insolvency jurisdiction, they administer charitable trusts, and the Testamentary Bill promises to give them a new and responsible sphere of action. It is evident that a County Court Judge fills now a high position, and that the appointment to the office nust be as carefully made as when a seat is vacant in the Court of Chancery or the Queen's Bench. Now comes the complaint of these hardwording and meritorious lawyers. The Treasury has the power of leaving a Judge's salary at 1,2001. or of raising it to 1,5001. a-year. The Treasury, as may be supposed, leaves the decision to an individual, who, the Judges say, is unacquainted with the subject; and, indeed, it must be a diffcult and invidious task for any man to determine how the bonns of 300C. shall be awarded. As few persons would presume to say that one Judge's legal merits are worth 1,2001., another's 1,5001.,thistestisdisregarded, and the quantity of labour is now supposed to determine the amount of remuneration. But how shall labour be measured ? Is not intensity to be taken into account as well as durationr ? If the Secretary of the Treasury counts the number of causes, may it not be that hundreds of these are uncontested ? If he counts the number of days, may it not be urged that one Judge decides more promptly than another, and that it is contrary to common sense to put a premium on delay ? If the country Judge has fewer cases brought before him, it must, be remembered that he has to travel to his business, while the town Judge has his court at a quarter of an hour's ride from his home. Hov, then, are we to decide on the respective claims of physical and intellectual exertion ? These arguments are so clear, that the Government has now abandoned its invidious and troublesome discretion, and proposes to fix the salaries of all County Court Judges at 1,2001. a-year. This is all that can be extracted from the LoIC CH-N_ CELLOn and HoME SECRETARY at present. Sir GEoiwEr GREY, however, intimates that it wvill be for the House of Co-mons, when the bill comes before them, to determine the precise amount ; and there 'will probably be no desperate resistance to fixing it at the higher rate of 1,500Z. a-year. It is to urge such a decision that we have discussed the matter. No one acquainted with English society will believe that 1,5001. is too large an in- come for a mnan of the attainments and position of a Judge deciding questions in four or five separate departments of law. The County Court Judges aro at work nearly all the year round; they have to make their circuits every month;, and while their salaries have been stationary, their business has been rapidly increasing. Only 18 out of the 60 Judges now receive the full salary. of 1,5001., and among them are all the town Judges, while their country brethren, whose labour has been largely increased within the last two years, under the Charitable Trusts Act and the act which empowers the Judges on circuit to refer causes involving matters of account to the County Courts, have generally only 1,2001. a-year. The proposal to continue the higher salary to thowe already in possession of it, but to limit their successors to thesmaller amount, seems to us to unite every fault which can deform a piece of legislation. Let us not stint the institution which has already effected so much good, but develope it in a generous spirit, confident that the result will reward our liberality. We have received the Moniteur of yesterday. It publishes the official account of the review in the Champ de MIars, but does not contain any additional news of interest.

NEW PHILHARMONXC SOCIETY. Theyounger of the twoPhilharmonic Societies takes the lead this season. Its first concert was given last night in the Hanover-square-Eooims. No explanation of the removal from Exeter Hal has been published, but we believe there were substantial reasons for the change. The following was the programme:- P.UAT L Overture-gmnont .Beethoven. Air-" Hat nmannicht Geld" (i5delio) .. Beethoven. Sinfonia-Violin and viola, rith orchestra Mozart. Vitany, in B ilat .rozart. Symphony,No.4 . . .. .. .. Beethoven. PALUT IL Ovcertre-Der l?eschutz .Weber. Becit. and Air (Faust) .Spchr. Concerto. No. 1-pianoforte . . endelezolo.. Chorus of Dervishez r. . B VeDn. Overture-Domino Noir .. .. .. .. Ai*er. Conductor, Dr. Wylde. Every piece in the above selection was in itself unobjec. tionable; but the whole combined made -the concert af least a third too long. One of the two compositions of lMozart (which were introduced for the first tiue in this country) might have been postponed with advantage till a future occasion; and, considering that Madame Ruidersdorff had quite enough to do in the first part, she might bave been spared the elaborate scena of Spohr, which, fine music as it undoubtedly is, came too late in the evening to be appreciated. It is a great mistake to spin out these concerts to such an intolerable length. The pleasure of listening before the end becomes a am, and some of the best pieces fall flat upon the ear, and leave the mind uninterested. This undue prolixity was severely felt last night, when the room was so inconveniently crowded that even a short concert would hardly have been listened to in comfort. The -"sinfonia" in 23 flat for violin and viola (conrantC would be a better name) is not only attractive as a relic of Mozart, but recently made known to the world ; it is a composition of rare merit, and an extremely happy specimen of the miaster. The combination of solo instrxuments is unusual; and the orchestral score, in wbich the only wind instruments written for are obeois and horns, is equally wortliy of notice, as an example of how much lozart was able to do with small means. The accompaniments display astonishing variety, and set off the solo passages-which are brilliant, effective, and admirably dovetalled-to the highest possible advantage. The form is that of the symphony-invariably adopted by MIozart in his concertosS Sainton and MIr. Blagrove, who undertook theprincipal instruments, played to perfection. Mr. 3lagrove must be complimented for his proficienev on the viola, of which the public had not before an opoortunity of judging. The Itany is a vork of greater pretensions than the "sin- "althongh not equally well balanced. The choruses, from the "KEyire" to the eud, are splendid, superior, indeed, to anything in the masses, and occasionally-as in the " Tremendum 3o vivificum," anld the "Pignus Iutu gloziiam-rising to the level of the ReQttiem itself. The * Viatici n flnDomino"-in which an old Gregorian melody ( Pange lingua gloriosi") is given to the soprano voices, za unison, as a cano fermo, and acconmpanied in the most ingenious manner-must also be cited. The "Pigus" is one of the grandest specimens extant of choral fugue, and derives a special peculiarity from the treatment of the words, " Miserere nobis," as an episode which becomes incessaltly an interruption, and at the same time a relief to the contrapuntal progress (sccundusm artifn) of the chorus. The execution of the Litany was unfortunately just as bad as that of the conctante was good. The chorus was sadly deficient; and this hitherto little known examaple of the glorious genius of Mozart has, consequently, yet to be appreciated. The solo vocal parts were intrusted to Madamc Ruidersdorff, Miss Ruidersdorif, Mr. G. Perren, and Signor Gregorio. The band is quite as numerous and efficient as last season, and, one or two slips and inaccuracies allowed for, together with a general absence of pianos, the overture and syniphony of Beethoren w-ere extremely well performed under tho direction of Dr. Wylde. Some parts, indeed, of the adago -mnd finale of the symphony we never heardgo better ; and in the last especially instances occurred of the good effect to be produced by a strict attention to piano when the composer has mark-ed " piano" in the score, which were elsewhere altogether wanting. The applause was unammous after every movement. Mendelssohn's pianoforte concerto in G minor was a genuine treat. 'I Charles EaU6 never more satisfactorily proved himself an executant in wyhomfaultless mechanism and ardent musical feeling are remarkably combined. We cannot, however, think otherwise than that the first allegro of the concerto -was taken at a pace too rapid to be in accordance with the character of the movement. But this may, after all, be only a matter of opinioL. Mendelssohn himself played it faster sometimes than at otliers, excusing himself vwith ingenuous simplicity on theplea that "one must be gay now and then;" andR Ha1ll night point to the composer as an argument in his own favour. Besides, all the rest was perfect; and, to conclude, the subscribers were enchanted both vith the music and the player, -whom-they applauded "tothe echo." The sucoess of AL HaU6 vas the more legitimate since he did notappear inthe orchestrauntil 11 o'clock, and had therefore, comparatively speaking, to shake the audience out of a lethargy induced by no less than three.hours' hard hearing of serious and uncompromising music. The pianist came on to play just at an hour when the concert should haeve been already over.
We have much pleasure in announcing that Colonel Sir R. Pavwlinson, K.C.B., has been appointed to sicmeed General Sir George Pollock as one of the nominated Directors of the East India Company. No choice could be more honourable to the Government or more likely to conduce to the good administration of Indian affairs. l\r. Keogh, Attorney-General for Ireland, will succeed the late Mlr. Justice Torrens upon the Irish Bench. TzE CRmrnx Lnqura.-The formalities attendant on the appointment of Sir A. Woodford as (hairman to this inquiry having been complied with, tLe Board has been summoned to meet to-day at 11 o'clock for the purpose of openin- the Court, and deciding what witnesses it may be aesirable to summon first. The Board will also decide upon -what documents or other evidence they will require to be produced, and will then appoint a day, probably Saturday or Monday, for conmmencing their investigation. TBE RoYAL MEDTcAL B ENvorEyr COLLEE.- The fourth auntal festival of this rising institution was celebratedyesterday evening by a grand banquet at the Freemasons' Tavern, under the presidency of the Right Hom. the Lord Mayor. It may be remembered that the new bUilding, agreeablyand salubriously situate on an eminenice about a mile from Epsom, was opened lastsummerbylPrince Albert, in presence of a distinguished company, and it may be also as well to remind our readers that the " Rvoyal Medical Benevolent College," which enjoys the atronage of the Queen, and is syled "Royal" by Her ajesty'sexpres, desire, was instituted for the maintenance and education of the orphan children of deceased medical men, and the reception of a certain number of medical men themselves. Were these benevolent designs insufficient to commend the asylum to the patrona-"e of the profession and of the public -for the interests of %oth are inseparable-it would only be necessary to point to the eminent and highly respectable names that strengtben the list of subscribers, independently of those that appeared in yesterday's list of stewards. The Lord MIayor was sapported by the treasurer, Mr. Propert, M 3fr. Alderman and *:heriffKennedy,Dr.Lowcock, Dr. G. R. Rowe,]Dr. Satheriand,Dr.Webster,Mr.uIZoyd Davies, M.P., SirC.Decim:isCrosley(ex-Sheriffof london and Middlesex), Dr. Quain, MEr. Bottomley (of Croydon), and other gentlemen more or less distinguished members of the faculty. To the usual loyal toasts amplo justice was done, and that of "The ATmy andNa#vy was not drunk- with-the less enthusiasm because the invaluable services of our gallant warriors are now terminated by the blessed advent of peace. -The Lord Mayor proposed the tout of-the evening in a-neat -and pithy speech-we might add, most practically eloquent, if it be tested by the result in pounds, shillings, and pence, for we have the pleasure to announce that ithe aggregate amount of the subscriptions and proeeeds of the Chapel Fund was no less than 4,OOO4,-oneof the most munificent "sums total," perhaps, ever recorded in the annals of eharitable dinners. it appears that the school of - the college (opened -last October) contains 150 boys, of whom 125 are "exiLbitioners," paying a certain sum, and 25 foundation scholars, intined entirely at - the co- of the charity.

Reve n to the dinner, it may be stated that aU the arrangements of Messrs. Elkungton and Co. gave great satisfaction, and were exaphatically approved by the Lord Mfayor and the commaittee.

FRANCE. (FR3OX OUR OWN COBRRFONDMiT.) PARIS, TuESDAY, APRIL 1, 6 P.M. A grand revie w of all tho corps stationed in the first military division took place to-day in the Champ de Mlars. This seemed to be regarded as in some measure the confirmation of the treaty of peace signed on Sunday, and from the magnificent spectacle which displayed itself before the eyes of the Russian Plenipotentiaries they might be corvinced that, whatever may be the motive for the discontinuance of the war, want of means to carry it on was not the one. The weather was most favourable; indeed, no more beautifl d.ay could be selected, had selection been in the power of man, for such a sight. Not 3 cloud, nor the shadow of a cloud, dimmed the transparency of the sky, or obscured the brilliancy of the sun from the moment he rose till he set again; and a light breeze, cool not cold, moderated the ardour of his rays. The Champ de Mars had been wav-tered so well during the night that the cavalry could go through their manceuvres without being envelopedin dust themselves, and the spectators could viewthat "sight entrancin.' withlilearmessand comfort. From an early hour in the morming various bodies of every arm of the service wereput in motion, and at intervals of 10 minutes or a quarterof an hour the bunrsts of martial music announced the passing | of the troops to the place of general rendezvous. Thousands upon thousands of spectators, never more excited than on such an occasion, accompanied the army in regular time to the sound of the bugle or the beat of the drum. Men, women, and children were all abroad. An immense crowd Billed the terraces of the Tuileries. The side alleys of the gardens themselves-the grand central avenue being kept clear for the Emperor and his cortege-- and the Place, and the Quays, and Champs Elysees, -were filled with human beings. At a quarter to 1 a squadron of the Cent Gardes issued from the gate of the Tuileries, which opens on the Place do la Concorde. The Emperor followved at some distance. His lajesty, who wore his usual uniform of General of Division, had Count Orloff on his right hand, and Prince Napoleon onbis left; and they vere followed by a numerous and brilliant staff. The coHe9ge proceededl along the Quai de Billy to the Pont de Jena, by wMhich he entered the Champ de MVfars. His appearance was the signal for all the bands to strike up, and he was hailed by the acclamations of the multitude. The troops were drawn up in the following order :-The left, from the Ecole Militaire to the nver, was occupied by seven lines of infantry, three of them formed by the Imperial Guard, and four by divisions of the Army of the East of France. In the first line were the three battalions of the Imperial Gendarmerie, and the eight battalions of the 1st and 2d Regiments of Grenadiers; in the second, the Reegiment of Zouaves, the ist and 2d V'oltigeurs; in the third, the division of Engineers and the battalion of Foot Chasseurs. Each line was separated from the other by a space of 20 vards. The four lines of the Ariy of theEast were formed bv the divisions of Generals Courtigis, Lamirault, Grosbon, and Forey. The troops of this last division had lately arrived from the Crimea, so that every man wore on his bremat the medal given by the Queen of England. The infantry, including the special corps of the garrison of Paris, presented an effective force of upwards of 00 battalions, under the orders of General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angely, commrander of the Imperial Guard. At the right extremity was drawn up the battalion aof the pupils of the Military School of St. Cyr, w-hich so well justifies the name of "first battalion of France." On the right, facing the infantry, from the Ecole Militaire down to the extremity of the Champ de MUars, the cavalry extended in five lines. These were the Guides, the Cuirassiers of the Imperial Guard, a brigade of CuiTassii-rs of the Line, the brigade of Carabineers, a brigade of Dragoons, a brigade of Lancers, one of Chaszeurs, another of Hiussars, and the squadrons of the G(arde de Paris and Gendarmerie de la Seine, forming together upwvards of 50 squadrons, under the command in chief of General Korte. 'The small square opposite the Ecole Militaire was -occupied by 12 batteries of the Imperial Guard and of the Line, under the orders of Generals Lebceuf and Aiuvity. At half-past 12 o'clock Marshal Magnan arrived on the ground, and assumed the command of the army. At 1 o'clock the beat of drums, the sound of trumpets, and the enthusiastic cries of the people anotunced the approach of the EmDeror Napole onI 11. on horseback, surrounded byrepresentatives of allthe Powers of Europe. The Emperor having passed before all the lines took his station in front of the Ecole iMilitaire, when the defile commenced, and lasted upwards of an hour. A banquet was given yesterday by Count Walewsld, Ministerfor Foreign Afiairs, to the Plenipotentiaries, the Members of the Diplomatic Corps, the Alembers of the Freich Cabinet, and other high functionaries of State, comprising in all about 40 persons. The noble apartment used for such occasions was beautifullv decorated, and the band of the Guides attendece, and played select passages from the favourite operas during dinner. Count Wale-wki of course presided, and the places af honour at his right and left wvere occupied by Lord Clarendon and Count Buol. All the guests were in full uniform, and wore the decol-ations of the orders to which they belong. WN'hen the dessert was placed on the table Count Walewski rose, and, in the midst of -profotnid silence, announced that he was about to propose a toast. His manner was grave, as became the occasion, and some even remarked that his features -ore a more serious cast than usual. His speech was brief and to the point. He said that he drank to the duration of the peace they had just signed, a11 the more as that peace wvas effeeted with- outinfcting humiliation onany one, and wvas apeace worthy of the nations wvhich had made it; it was bumblinlg to no one, and highly honourable to all. he toast vwas, of course, +ell received. It was ex ected thalt Lord Clarendon would have said a few wor s, and that Count Orloff vould have responded to the sentiment; but both English and Russian Plen:potuntiaries refrained, I am assured, from offerimg any observations, probably from the conviction that Count WValewski had said quite sLfficient for the ptui-ose. Nevertheless, this silence g,ave occasion to various observations and comments among the guests. The silence of Lord Clarendon appearedto most c.f themi as a prudent reserve, but thatof Count Orloff was Itot so easily explained, and it formed the topic of conversation during the evening,-otherwise nothing else remarkable occurred. The other PIellipotenti:tries wvere placed without distinction, and alternately, among the members of the Diplomatic Corps. By I:periall decrees Count Waleweki has been raised to tl:e ran; of Grand Cross of the Legion of HEfonour, "'in consequenice of the eminent services which he has rendered as Minister of Foreign AfF-irs ,'' and Baronl de Bourqueney to the dignity of Senator, for his services during the late diplomatic Liegotiations. This, it appears, is the night of the official illuminations, those of Sunclay being merely spontaneous. The houses along the Boulevards are gaily decorated with flags and streamers. The Rue de la Paix, not unmiindful of its origin and its name, is particularly fine. Most of the shops have been cloSed all day, and from the Italian Boulevard to the Place VendOme will to-night look like an avenue of light and drapery. All the public build- ings oresent the same gay appearance, and the beauty of the weather, .and the crowds tltatperambulate the streets, add to the: ninnation of the scene. Im cdiate]y after the signature of the treaty informationt of the fact was sent off by electric telegraph to 3arshal Pelissier. The aimnistice, which expired yesterday, has been prolonged for four weeks.

The news of the conclusion of the peace at Paris reached Berlin late yesterday afternoon, but did not become generally known until this morning, seeing that on Sunday evening the population is entirely divided among private circles and public places of amusement. It reached the Royal family while at dinner at Charlottenbnrg ; and, in celebration of the auspicious event, the entire party, together with such persons of distinction as could be collected at the spur of the moment, returned thanks the same evening in the Royal chapel of the Schloss there, which was specially illuminated for the occasion. The unusually joyous pealing of the bells attracted thither also a numerous party of the inhabitants of Charlottenburg,and of the Berliners whobappenedto be spending the day there. It is a singular historical coincidence that it was also on MIarch 30, in the year 17 63, that Friedrich II. returned thanks in the same chapel for the conclusion of a peace at the end of the Seven Years' War. I do not hear at present of any public rejoicings being ordered by any authority or intended by any private persons to take place here. For any demonstrations of the sort Prussia has been too little affected by the war, but the prayer for peace in the churches is being altered into a thanksgiving, which, after it has met with the ;ing's approval to-day, will be forwarded to-morrow to all the consistories throughout the country, so as to be read in all churches next Sunday. It is the King's intention to confer on Bairon Von Manteuffel the order of the Black Eagle, the highest order in Prussia, and of wlhich there is only one class; and this has been explained to me by a man high in office to be intended as a token of the Royal approbation and favour for having brought Prussia through all the difficult passages of the late negotiatiolIs without plung,ing her into war, and, above all, without falling into anything like an alliance with Russia. The Conmmittee of the Herrenhaus to wvhich the application of the military authorities for permission to put Herr Von Rochow and Herr Von der MLIarvitz on their trial for participation in the Hinekeldey duel was referred, has decided that, as the former had delivered himself up to the military autlhorities, it was no longer necessary for the House to exercise its option in the matter; in the case of the latter, whom the authorities had only just decided on brinthng to his trial, the committee recommended the House to comply with the application. A motion was therefore made in this sense, and passed unanimously. The more the knowledge of the circumstances connected with the Potsdam theft of papers becomes general, the more general also becomes the cry for judicial inquiry, in order that the really guilty may be recognized, and the guiltless cleared. A reason given by the Pu<blicistan organ of the police-why no judicial inquiry has as yet been entered upon is that notheft had been comlmitted-i. c. no palpable property had been abstracted; the men-servants had confined their malpractices to the copying of papers, or lending those papers to others to copy; but, as these documents were not State papers, there is no law by which this breach of trust could be punished. The Publicist is by no means an immaculate authority, and I have repeatedly been assured that various papers were actually purloined; and, though I hold this latter to be improbable, I consider that, wlhatever the truth on this poinlt may be, the Government would, in all I probability, spare no effort to prevent any public judicial inquiry being made into it. In the article which the Kreuz Zeitutng lately published on the subject it was stated, as I mentioned in my letter of the day it, appeared, that the report about the Prince of Prussia's sayings and doings had been sent to GeneralVon Gerlach bv the man Lindenburg without any authority from the former to take any notes I of the subject, or take any steps in the matter; this 'statement has been since corroborated by a declaration made by the latter in his paper, the Pattiotische Zeitlung; but it is to be apprehended that neitlher the oifginal statement nor the corroborative declaration will find much credence with the public. Another statement of the Kreutz Zeituvg, wvhich I passed over at the time as worthless, together with the siiugestion appended, is now being repudiated by the entire press and by society at large. The KreuizZeitatnqg assured itsreaders that " the IMinister-President had in no way caused or promoted or known of that theft." WVhat is here stated I is probably true, but, setting aside the improba- bility that the Minister-President would authorize his party organ to make any statement for himn on a subject on wshich he alone is the competent authority, while he has an organ of his own, the Prevssische (Cor responde'az, and setting aside also the almost impossibility of the Kreuvz Zeitung having at the date of its article received any authority from Baron Von 31anteuffel to do so, he being at the tine in Paris, the suggestion it threw out woLuld be most fatal to the reputation of the Mtinister-President. It gave its readers to understand that the latter stands a great deal too high to make it worth his while to declare his innocence to the world; this was only a trap to entice him into silence, w-hich would leave all the world at liberty to believe the imputation thrown on him. Baron Von M1antetuffel has, I hear, taken the. more preferable course. At his desire, conveyed hither fronm Paris, the Council of MIinisters has already taken into consideration the necessity of inquiring inito the truth of the statements conveyed in Herr Seiffart's defence. These were, as regards the 2linister-President, that he had had the man Techen in his pay, and tllat the nature of the documents procured for him by the latter was such as that the latter could have obtained them by no honest means, &c. The Public Prosecutor has already commenced proceedings against Herr Seiffart for slander, and the head of bis office has also ordered an investigation into his conduct as a matter of official discipline. The storm of indignation that has risen up against Seiffart has also induced his constituents to call upon him to resign his seat in the House of Deputies. Among other revelations which come gradually to light, it appears now that a number of the copies made by Techen of the stolen papers brought to him were made on paper beaxing the stamp of Herr Seiffart's office, from which he must either have abstracted it or have had it given him by the latter. Further, it appears that Seiffart was not the only person to w honi Techen made the assertion of his being in the pay of Baron Von Manteuiffel ; he duly -impressed this upon his accomplices, the two menservants; and, for the purpose of increasing the credibility of his statement, it appears that he endeavoured to bribe a subaltern official of the Foreign-office to procure an envelope to be addressed to him by the i1linister-President. It is also positively asserted that the only two papers -which were brouight to the knowledge of Baron Von Manteuffel (though not by Techen) from among the stolen property were by him immediately laid before the an General Von Gerlach, and were among the first things that raised suspicion as to foul play going on somewhere. ApvowsoNs BiL.-A bill brought in by Mr. Child, Lord 11.

IRELAND. DUB11N, WXiDxsDAy MOENwG. I (FROM OUR OWN CORESPONDrE'!.) THE TIPPEARAY iBASN-MOEE DISCLOSURES. A brief notice has been given of the proceedings in reference to this unfortunate bank which took place on Monday in the office of the Master in Chancery. As some new disclosures, bearing upon the gigantic system of fraud carried on by John Sadleir, were elicited in the course of the investigation, a fuller report is subjoined of the important evidence given by Messrs. Kennedy and Morrough, solicitors, of Great Demnark-street "MIr. James B. Kernedy was sworn and examined by Mr. Lawless.-Xave you in your possession securities, bonds, or notesof any kind, the property of the Tipperary Bank 2-Yes, I have. " Independent of those securities, do you know of others of similar classes 7-Yes, I do. "II mean securities that were vested in the Tipperary Bank, and which are not in your possession 9-Vested either in the Tipperary Bank or in trust for it. " To M3r. Lawless.-I have lodged two partiership deeds of the bank, one being a very old one, which I believe was superseded by the other, a subsequent one; any of the securities we have in our possession we are prepared to lodge in court as a matter of course. "3aster.-Of course, without prejudice to your lien. "Mr. Lawless.-Could you mention any of the securities that are not in sour possession? Witness.-There is a mortgage, I think of the Glenall estate, for 12,0001., which I believe was the money of the bank. It was made about April, 1847, to Mr. Aintony N orris, of London, as trustee for the bank. He has denied to me, by his letters of a very recent date,that he held that mortgage as trustee. Are you able togive a list of the properties purchased by the late Mir. Sadleir in the Encumbered Estates Court? -Yes, I can give you it. "A Are you able to state how he disposed of them ?-I am. He sold the greater portion of them, and he also assigned a portion to the London and County Bank. "Mr. Lawless.-We shall require all the particulars of these properties. To your knowledge, did Mr. Sadleir ever make, or agree to make, any assignment of those.properties in favour of the Tipperary Bank ? "Witness.-He did. As well as I remember, the date was Mlarch, '55. I was not present at it, but Mr. Keatinge came over to Ireland with a letter from Mr. Sadleir, which I saw. I have not got that letter; Mr. Keatinge, I presume, has it. "IMaster.-Were any of the purchases made with a view of giving any security to the Tipperary Bank? "Witness.-They were not made for that purpose, to my knowledge. IIMIr. Lawless.-Are you acquainted with the personal property of Mr. Sadleiri.-No, not intimately; I heard he possessed a great many shares in the Swiss, Swedish, and man raivays, and matters of that kdnd. "Master.-Will you be able to let us know the arrears of rent due for those properties up to the time of his death ? " Witness.-Yes, certainly, but it nill take spme time we can give you the particulars of all the estates that he pur. chased in Ireland up to the day previous to his death; there were 20 assignmentsof them to the London and County Bank; I don't think we have copies of those assignnments; I knew nothing about it until the deeds were sent to be registered. Some of them were not registered at first on account of the stamps not being sufficient for the practice in this country, and besides there was no consideration |money stated. Registry being refused here they were taken back to London. They wvere returned with some form of certificate from Somerset House, and then they were registered. " a*ster.-Was there not a mortgage of some part of the Kingston property, of plate, furniture, and other matters ii Lord Kingston's house ? " Witness.-Yes, there was; I cannot tell from memory when it was e-xecuted; I don't know where the original is. " Mr. Kennedy (to Mr. Lawless).-I think there were three urchases of property in theEncumbered Estates Court made by Xr. James Sbdleir; twro of these were in his own name, and one wvas in the name of a third party; the first was the house quarter of Coolnamuck, aboutAugost, 1852, for S,5001.; that w-as made by himself and in his own name, and the purchase-deed was executed. He has since been in possession of it. I could not state the rental. The greater part of that property is in his own hands. He has a steward named Rafferty. The next of these properties that he purchased was a small portion of White's estate. I don't know the name of thc lands inthe county of Tipperary. The sale was made 'In re Matilda White.' The purchase money was 8001. He is now in possession of this property, the conveyance of whiclh was executed to himself. The other property is caled Kilconnell, near Cashel, and the purchase money was 5,M001. The conveyance of it was excuted to a Mr. Farmery J. Law, of London. I do not know how it happened that the conveyance was executed to Mr. Law. " Mr. Lawless.-Have you the means of ascertaining from what source Mlr. Janies Sadleir procured the purchase money of those three estates ? "Witness.-I have not the slightest idea. "Examination continued.-At resent it -would be hard to tell the rental of the Kilconnel estate; I think it is over ,00I. a-year, subject to a sort of renteharge of 1841. We have a rental of it; I think we have printed rentals of the other two estates, and we can furnish alL In the lastmentioned property the tenancies have been changed since the sale. MIr. James Sadleir has been in the receipt of the rents of the Kilconnell estate. Mr. Law never went into possession of it. I 3Master.-Do you know if Mr. Sadleir has any one in eharge of the unoccupied portion of it? "\ Vitness.-3Mr. Byrne, of Blackrock, is the asent over it, and he has a stewvard there. I appointed gr. Byrne agent on the part of Mr. James Sadleir.Mr. Law's name was used in the appointment of the agent, but practically and beneficially he was appointed for Mr. James Sadleir. " '3r. Lawless.-It was not Mr. Law who paid the purchase money? iWitness.-No, the money was Mr. Sadleir's. "Master.-When you were asked whether 3Mr. Law was aware of the matter or not, you said emphatically, "he is now.' "' Witness.-I did not at the moment remember that I had received a letter from him in connexion with the estate vious to the taking out of the conveyance. I believe that when the estate was purchased he did not know that it was in his name. Within the last fortnight an assignment of the property to Mr. James Sadleir has been prepared and sent over to Mr. Law for his signature. I understand Mr. James Sadleir has another estate in Tipperary, called Baynalode, which he had previous to his marriage. I believe it is settled. According to the English practice, where property is settled there is one deed for the lady and another for the gentleman, and I have a counterpart of Mr. Sadleir's deed. I believe he got 10,0001. with Mrs. Sadleir. It was vested in trustees. I don't remember the termn of the settlement. "I Master.-ks far as Icould understand the settlement, it gives her a life use with remainder to 3Mr. Sadleir in case he shall survive her, and in default of survivorship, and in the event of there being no children, the property goes back, to bMrs. Sadlei's relatives, and his own property is disposed of in a similar manner. "Mr. Lawless.-There is personal property, consisting of furniture, &-c., comprised in some of the deeds. Is it stil at Mitchelstown ? "' Witness.-It is. "M Mr. D5eldon.-With the exception of some in a silversmith's in London. "M r. Lawless.-Has any portion of that been disposed of by the mortgagees ? "Mr. Meldon.-It was removed by Lord Kingston privately, and afterwards was stopped by an injunction at the suit of Lord Lorton. " Mr. Morrogh was then sworn and examined by MIr. Lawless as follows:-The date of the mortgage of Lord Glengall's property is April, 1847; it was made by Lord Glengall to Mr. Antony Norris, the amount being 10,5001.; there are no trusts declared on the face of the deed. M31r.Lawless.-Was itintendedasatrust for any persons or any company? " itness.-I have no means of stating, but my general impression is that the money was the property of the Tipperary Bank. There has not been any payment of interest on that mortgage since but the ultimate payment of the amount is seciure, for the charges on the fee have been met by tho sale of a sufficient portion of the lands in the Encumbered Estates Court. " 3Ister.-Had Mr. Norris any 'ther securities of Lord Glengall ? iI Witness.-He had, I think, previous to the date of the mortgage, but they were all merged in it. 31r. Lawless.-Do you know what they were? "Witness.-They iere for money lent to Lord Glengali, and to his agent for him, from time to time, for years before the mortgage. "Was that money lent by Mr. Norris or by the bank ? It was the Tipperary Bank that supplied the money. " Was Mr. lNorris aware of that 7-He was aware it was supplied by John Sadleir, or by the Tipperary Bank; the pleadings in the suit of 'Norris v. Lord Glengall' would disclose the extent of Mfr. Norris's knowledge of the cir- cumstances. " Was any account open in the books of the bank in relation to the Gleugall estate 7-There has been. "W Was it by draughts on that accounit that the money was advanced to Lord Glengall7.-No; that account was not opened for some time subsequent to the execution of the secursties. "The pleadings in Morris and Glengall state the fact that the security is claimed by Mr. Norris as trustee 7-A cross F bill was filed in-1847 by Lord Glengall, to impeach the transaction on the ground of his having been overcharged some -interest, and ho subsequently siged a consent dismissing his bill with costs, and then executed the security. "Was there any answer by Mr. Norris to that cross suit? "In connexion with the securities held by the Tipperary bank affecting Lord Kingston's estate there are a certain number of policies of insurance. Do you know in whose possession they are 2 "Witness.-In 1849 they were taken by the late Mr. Sadleir to London, as appears by a legistry-book of securitieskept in our office; and in Mrch, 1854, hewrote to state that they were lost, and to inquire as to getting duplicates of them. I will furnish a list of those policies, " Master.-As I understand you, the money was formerly lodged in the Tipperary Bank, and then paid out on checks to the different mncumbrancers; but since the late unfortunate occurrence Mfr. Nicholas Sadleir has himself been paying the interest on the incumbrances according to the priorities ? Witness.-Yes. "MIr. Lawless.-Where does he reside? "Witness.-In Tipperary. "Examination continued.-Mr. John Sadleir took with him to London the deed appointing Mr. Nicholas Sadleir to that receivership, andIneversawitaince. I cannot recollect whether the policies were mentioned in it or not. The first trust of that deed was the, payment of the interest on the charges on the Kingston estate; the next the payment of 2,5001. a-year interest to the Albion Company; the next the payment of the premiums on the Albion insurances; and the next the leeping up of the bank insurances. After the death of the late Mr. John Sadleirl found among his papers in London six policies of insurances connected withthe Kingston estate - they had been effected by Messrs. Parker and WValter, who were annuitants on the life estates. I have got those policies. I found also a deed transferring them from Messrs. Park-er and Walter jointly to Mr. Walter alone. There was a subsequent deed transferring them to a M. Eyre, in payment of 15,0001., which Idid not find "M Mr. Lawless.-Did you find any deeds connected with the affairs of the Tipperary Bank? " Witness.-No, save the deed of partnership, which has been lodged in the Master's offace. I think I found a mauuscript copy of the bank deed, which has been lodged in the Master's office.

FRAUDS ON UNDERWBrITERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have this evening read with interest the account of the annual meeting of the members of Lloyd's, headed as above, which appears in your paper of to-day. A motion " to consider the condition of the underwriting business as it now exists" seems to have attracted an " unusualli large attendance." The question was well worthy of consideration, but the motion was " declared to be negatived." No wonder. Important motions must be supported by stronger arguments and calmer reasoning. Surely Mfr. Watts could not expect the sensible underwriters of Lloyd's to go with him in his arguments against " the use of iron in the construction of ships," " the increased size of mercantile vessels," and what he calls the " clipper nuisance." " The difliculty of procuring competent captains and mates" is more imaginary than real. Good owners find none, and " the necessity of making use of undersized, drunken, outport, and foreign lubbers" is a figure of speech not altogether applicable to his argument, and unjust towards a large body of industrious men. Nor can the leading underwriters of Lloyd's feel that the "introduction of steam" has tended to increase the losses at sea; and I, for one, deny that the legislative enactments since 1S50 have in any way produced the evils of which he complains. "Legislative tinkering of tho laws by ignorant statesmen, for the most part set in nmotion by interested adventurers," is not the style of language most likely to convince. These laws, though not so perfect as might be desired, have done much to improve British shipping, aud any one who chooses to walk round our docks may at a glance note the rapid stride which has been made since they came into operation. Without fear of contradiction, I may venture to remark that within these last five years there have been far greater improvements in British shipping, in strength, in safety, in speed, and in all the essential qualities of sea-going vessels, than in any twenty-I may say in any fifty previous years. STor have our captains and our mates been behind in the race of conapetition, for they have vastly improved, and the system of examination adopted at our Mercantile Marine Boards has aided that improvement in no ordinary degree. Able seamen, it is true, have been more than usually scarce, but that arises entirely from ourwar demand; and if the law which prevented us from employing other than British seamen had not been repealed the scarcity would have been far greater, and the consequences much mnore serious. I question, toe, if the competition with foreign seamen lhas not materially tended to improve our own, for as a class they are less addicted to habits of intemperance, and it is most unjust towards these mnen to call them " drunken foreignlubbers." As to our " outport" seamen, who are also styled " drunken lubbers" by Mr. Watts, any one conversant with the matter knows full well Utat the seamen frons the outports are the best we possess. London and I Liverpool can produce no such men as the port of Shields. Theymayberough,but theyare ready;andforknowledge of duty, alacrity, and sobriety they are not, as a body, to be surpassed by any class of seamen in the world. Connected as I am with that port, I cannot be silent while they are slandered. The bulk of the depraved and worthless are to be found in the dens of depravity and vice with which our great sea-ports abound; but those laws which Mr. Watts attempts to ridicule are doing much to cure the evil. How the introduction of steam and the construction of iron vessels can increase the losses at sea I am utterly aloss to conceive. Why, the use of steam has saved hundreds of ships from a lee shore, and, has carried them clear of rocks and shoals oInwhich sailing vessels must have foundered. Iron, too, as everybody now knows except. Mr. Watts and a few oldfashioned gentlemen, is a material infinitely superior to WOOd for the constrsction of vessels. There is no comparison between the strength of the two. It was only the other day that the captain of the Persia (Cunard's line) remarked I tlink while expressing his fear of the loss of the Pacific that had his ship been built of wood instead of iron she must have foundered amosig the icebergs. It is true there are some who prophecy that in 10 years there will be no such thing afloat as an iron ship. They can hardly yet realize the idea of iron being made to swim. But there are false prophets now as of old. Very recently an old gentleman offered to wager me 201. to 20s. that such would be the case, but when he offered to double the stakes in favour of hempen cables, and prophesied also the total extinction in time of those which are made of iron, I could only smile and wonder if he was serious. I may hold views of too opposite an extreme, but every day I feel more convinced that ere 10 years there will hardly be a merchant ship constructed of wood, and that to almost every vessel the power of steam will be applied as an auxiliary. But-Mr. Watts, before he sends forth to the world statements to the effect that the losses of the underwriters have been greatly increased within these last five years by the causes he names, would better have had a return of the tonnage at present afloat and the tonnage afloat 20 years ago, when none of those causes esiisted, and compare the pe rcentage of loss now with what it was then. I write frem recollecton, but I feel pretty certain that he would have found such a return conclusive against his arguments and the inferences he has drawn. The "additional liability" of underwriters arises from very different causes. It rests far more with themselves than with the ships they insure; and if it has really got now to such a pitch they must reform thenmselves. Nobody else can do it for them. They speculate, and they must abide the consequences ; or rather, they have admitted a class of men who, as they have little tolose, will always speculate in the hope of excessive gain. The association of ILoyd's will not maintain its high position I unless they, one and all of its members, xay their debts. It I is, therefore, for the members of that old institution to see as far as practicable, and have some guarantee in the shape of a bond, that those who write can pay. This is only iust to those who can, and to the public. Though they write as ndividuals, the public only know them as a body, and the shortcomings of one without character and means must iniure hisneighbour who has both. Though separate in their individual transactions, theircasc is altogether different to that of individuals engaged in ordinary trades of a similar nature. I differ from Mr. Watts in much he has said, but experience has led me to feel the justice of his remarks about ".manufactured claims for sea-damage" on goods. That practice is carried on to a disgraceful extent, and that is the main cause of the " additional liability ' but it rests with the niembers of Lloyd's to lessen, if not entirely remove, this great evil. Their system of agency requires a thorough reform. Its very nature may encourage fraud. They may easily arrange a plan to detect one or two of the culprits who "mnanufacture claims." If one or two of them were orce detected, thoroughly exposed, and punished, others (who think it no crime to cheat the underwriter) will soon abandon the practice. Those roguish " merchants" (?) will find that honesty is indeed the best policy in the long run. These are the claims by which underwriters sulffer. But they suffer seriously in the loss of business besides; for the more numerous the claims the higher must be the rate of premium, and, consequently, as the upright merchant aud shipowner feels that he is paying extra premiums to meet the claims of dishonest men, he limits the extent of his insurances, and when he has a large amount afloat and widely spread he finds it to his gain to become his own underwriter. Thus the business of Lloyd's is materially curtailed to what it would be if a bold stroke were made to put down at all hazards those unprincipled men who wilfully damage their goods so as to "manufacture claims" upon under'writers. The trade, like many other- nefarious ones, must yield no common profit, for, from all I can learn, it is carried on to no ordinary ectent. Lam. Sir. vnmr hlhAipt i vtnf. W. S. L1tDSAY. ' 3oarch 'T.
BiRMdHAM PROVIDEINT-T INsTMmoX.-The 23d anniversary of the Birmingham Provident and Benevolent Institution was celebrated by a tea party a. the Townn-haU on Tuesday evening. The Earl of Albemarle presided, and there was a large attendance. The chairman earnestly advocated that and similar institutions, and said his hearts desire was to see the labouring classes of this country raised in society and holding the position they ought to hold as denizens of the freeest nation of the world. Provident societies were calculated to advance their po8ition. There was but one subject. more interesting to the well-wisher of the working classes than that of their provident societies-he meant education-the short, suro way to independence, comfort, and ha piness. It was want of education which made the poor man improvident. The worldng men of this country spent annuaUy 50,0O0,0001. in waste, thus squandering as much as their employers earned. The noble Earl, in conclusion, dwelt upon the evils entailed upon the working classesby intemperance, and urgedthem to support such institutions as the present. The annual renort, w hich was read, gave a satisfactory account of all the drepartments of the institution. After several speeehes by clergymen and gentlemen in advocacy of the institution n vote of thanllk w35 passed by. acclamatiQl th the cnaiman.

The greater part of these vessels are Swedes and Norwegians, repairing ultimately eastward, in hopes of getting freights from Russian ports in the Black Sea." We have received advices from the squadron off Kertch up to the 17th ult., by which we learn that on the 27th of Februarythe screw steamers Arrow, Lynx, and Snake, each mounting four guns,left St. Paul's Straits for the Sea of Azoff, under the command of Captain A. P. Ryder, of the Dauntless, in order to reconnoitre the Arabat Spit. Having vainlyendeavoured for two days to make way through the masses of floating ice, they were compelled to return to their anchorage, where they arrived on the 1st Of March, without sustaining any damage. A heavy gale of wind set in on the 6th ult. The Dauntless had two anchors down, with five shackles of cable out on the port bower and two on the starboard anchor, and was lying alongside the transport ship William. In consequence of her close proximity to the transport the Dauntless was unable to veer cable; neither could the former do so vdithout getting aground. While in this position (a most critical one for both vessels) the Dauntless was observed to be drifting; both sheet anchors were let go, which fortunately brought her up, bat not until she was across the cables of the transport. Her screw propeUer could not be put in motion without incurring the serious risk either of breaking it or cutting asunder the cables of the other vesseL After remaining for several hours in this precarious situation, shortly after midnight the gale partially subsided, when both vessels shifted their berths; otherwise the consequences might have been to both most disastrous. The Arror screw-steamer left Eertch on the evening of the 16th ult. under a flag of trace, -with despatches relative to the armistice for the Russian General at Nlaffa. General Willianas, who w as to be exchanged for an officer of simailar rank, made prisoner at Kinburn, was nominated for the command of tho Turkish Contingent. On being relieved by the Leopard steam-frigate, whose arrival off Kertch was shortly expected, the Dauntless was to proceed to Mlalta, to undergo a refit.

All the gunboats which were exercised the day before were put through similar evolutions yester. day, and were watched by large asmblages of interestel spectators. The Centaur, 6, paddle-frigate, Captain Clifford, C.B., left Spithead last evening for the westward; andthe Devsstation, 6, Commnder Marshall, left for the Cape of Good Mope soon after. The Magicienne, 16,. paddle-frigate, Captain Vansittrt, left Spithead yesterday morning for the eastward. The Resolute steam-transport, lWo. 214, left Spithead yesterday morning for the East, witi supernumerary ma. -ines and boys for the fleet, a few cavalry, and about 50 of the British Italian Legion.

The Berwick was awaiting favourable weather to resume her voyage. The Great WVestern, which sailed from Southampton on the 12th ult. with horses and troops for the Crimea, arrived at Gibraltar on the 20th after experiencing severe weather. During the night of the 15th she encountered a severe south-south_ westerly gale, which split and seriously damaged her rudder. head. Three of the animals on board perished, owing to the severity of the weather. Thesteam-trausport Amity, eight dayg from London, with Government stores for Balallava arrived out duringthenight of the 20th, having also experienced heavy weather, which carried away her main boom an& stove in her cutter. After coaling and taking in water she railed for her destination on the 22d ult. The steamtransport Trent arrived in the Bay on the 21st, with the gans of H er Aajetys fl oating battery 3 eteor on board, and the vessel in tow, on her way to England. The Trent, having taken in coals, sailed for her destination, taking the battery in tow, on the 23d, but was obliged to return during the afternoon of the same day. The sailing-transport Idinden arrived at Gibraltar from IMalta vwith shot and shell, which she would discharge at Gibraltar, previously t, sailing for England. The Imperial, with stores for the East, arrived out on the 24th ult. The Government transport East Anglian, No. 162, arrived at Woolwich yesterday, laden -with barrack stores fromtheTowerforDablin. She is to ship powder fromthe ArsenaL Some novel experiments took place in Woolwich-ma-shes on Tuesday. which were attended-by members of the select committee for the purpose of testing the efficiency of some explosive shels, the invention of a Mr. Martin. The invention consists of cast-iron shells, constructed in a peculiar manner, and fzlled -with liquid iron. Some specimens were fired and burst with very good effect, scattering the fragments over a considerable space, and setting fire to the wooden butt and other buildings which had been erected for the purpose of the experiment. A second invention, of a similar kind, was put through certain trialsat the same time. This was the property of two Frenchmien who have arrived at Woolwich with the specil intention of subjecting their invention to the opinion of tha authorities of the War Department at Woolwich ArsenaL It consisted also of an iron shell flUed with some fiercely burning materials, but which, on undergoing several tests, turned out a complete failure as far as the present experimnents extended. Lieutenant-Colonel Henry, B.A., left Woolwich on Tues day, fGr the purpose of proceeding to the Crimea to join his troop there. A considerable transfer of volunteers from MEIitia regiments to the siege train newly arrived at -Woolwich has taken place. The 17 companies have each received an addition to their ranks of an average number of 60, making in the aggregate 1,020 men. The following appointments have been made at the Admiralty*- Lieutenant W. E. England, to the Surprise; John Hotham, midslipman, to the Dulue of Welington; H. B. S. Coble, naval cadet, to the Calcutta; A. Irwin, surgeon (confirmed); Assistant-surgeon Constantine Keenan (confinned); F. E. Whalley, master's-asistant,to the Brunswick; Joseph H. Manly, clerk, to the Driver; W. E. P. Saer, assistant-clerk, to the Euryalus. The Carlowv Rifles and the depOt of the 69th Regiment. who have been for the past eight or nine months ceuartered. in Kilkenny, have received orders to be in readiness to proceed to Clonmel immediately, there to relieve the 5th Lancashire Militia, whvo march to Dublin. The Rifles and the 69th are in daily expectation of receiving the route, as they are to be succeeded by the depOt of the 58th Regiment. The dep6t of the 58th Regiment, under Brevet LieutenantColonel Cyprian Bridge, wvll immediately nmove from the Linen-hall Barracks, Dublin, to Kilkenny, where it will be joined bythe service companies now on passage from New Zealand to Cork. It has been stated that the late Duke of Wellington was once stationed in Klk-enny with this regimnent, in whichhe was appointed Captain the 30th of .Tnne, 1791, and firom which he was transferred the 31st of October, 1792, to the late 18th Light Dragoons. TEE IlITIA. The North Down Militia, 600 strong, arrived in Dublin from Belfast on Tuesday, enL route to the Camp at the Curragh. The ceremony of presenting colours to the 1st Regiment of Royal Cheshire ;lhitia took- place yesterday on the racecourse at Chester, in the presence of a ar-ge number o spectators. The colours having been consecrated by the Bishop of Chester, the Marchioness of Westminster presented them to the regiment, after an appropriate address. Lieutenant-Colonel Chohmondeley returned thanks on behalf of the regiment.
THBE PETBN 7SLAR MAILS. SOUTHANPTON, ArRm 2. By the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Sultan, Captain Cook, with the Peninsular mails in charge of Lieutenant Stewart, R.N., Admiralty agent, we have dates from Gibraltar, March 24 ; Cadiz, March 25; Lisbon, March 29; Oporto and Vigo, March 30. The Sultan brings, besides passengers, three boxes of specie, value 715L, 958 half-chests and 48 boxes of oranges, 65 cases of potatoes, and 25 packages of sundries. During the homeward voyage the Sultan experienced strong breezes from the south-east, south, and south-west. On the 31st ult. she exchanged colours with the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Madrid and a large French war steamer steering to the southward. This packet left in the Tagus on the 29th ult. Her Ma. jestys steamship Blenheim and a Svedish corvette, which arrived thc previous evening from Cadiz; also the French war stA4uner Sentinelle, about to leave for Rochefort. E xchzange transactions on London were limited, at 54i for three months ; on Paris little was done at 519; and onHam. burg at 49L; while Ansterdam was nominal at 43A, and. Genoa at 517. Stock-market dull. Portuguese Three per Cents., 41 to 424; Bank of Portugal Shares, 500 to 505 milreis; Bank of Oporto Shares, 16 to 17A per cent. premium. Our Lisbon correspondent writes on the 29th ult. " All interest in Portuguese politics is at present centered upon the financial measures recently laid before the Cortes by 3 Fontes. The Ministry has done its best to press them forward, and yesterday succeeded in getting the deputies on both sides of the house to concur in commencing the debates on the 31st inst. The committee's report in favour of Mr. Thornton's arrangement for the Portuguese bondholders and the proposed new loan of 3,000,0O0l. for railways and other works idli then be brought forward; but the discussions are expected to embrace the whole of the negotiations eitered into by 3x Fontes in London and Paris. Hence, the debates wi be very protracted, and, although the Chartist and Liberal Oppositions have formed a junction on the Right benches of the House, I do not find in well-informed quarters those doubts that all the bils will be ultimately approved which some of the Lisbon joumals inculcate. In the Lower House I ain convinced the Ministers will have double the number of the Opposition votes, and believe they will as usual manage to get a small majority in the Peers. The Portuguese complain that they have got the English climate; since heavy rains have now for a third time set in, and again destroyed the grain sown on the low lands upon the banks of the T'agus, which are once more tinder water. Orange packing is also suspended, and much fruit has been destroyed." From Gibraltar we learn that the screw steamship Frank fort, 6l days from Liverpool, arrived out on the 2Dth ult. The screw steauier Tamaulipas, which put into that port on the 9th nlt. from Malta, with main shaft broksen, was to sail for Liverpool on the 25th ult. The latest quotations of exchange at Gibraltar for bils oe London, at 90 days' date, are 50 to ,; Paris, 5 39c. Spanish pilLared dollars realized 8 per cent. premium.
2- * T0 THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am directed by the committee of this association to state, with reference to the admirable letter of Him Kightingale to a soldier's wife of the S9thEegiment in 17ic Times of yesterday, that this poor woman and her family have been receiving an allowance from this association ever since her husband left her at Gibraltar, on the 7th of December, 1854, up to the prefent time. Alter her arrival in England she was confined of another child at South Shields, and during her confinement and illness was particnlasiy cared for by the excellent rector of St. Stephen's:ChuMI, the Rev. J. B. Brasher, who also most kindly acted.a. the almorner of our finds at that place. Had we kno*f-t6A she was a &.dow we should have reported her vs to tike Patriotic Fand, and the allowance overpaid by ua-upwada of 121.-would have been refunded, as it has been alrea1yin many similar instances. By this arrangement the widows are never actually vithout an allowance, either froa tho Central Association as wives, or from the Pfatriotic hFd as widows. As it might be supposed from iEss NiOtingile'6 letter that this soldier's wife was not in the reipt or any allowance, the committee of the Central Assooitson wOu]d feel obliged by your mading the contenta of this lettee known.

INDIA AND CHINA. IA portion of the following appeared In our aecond dition of yesterday:-] We have received by the Overland Mail ouir :private correspondence and files of papers-from Bombay of the 5th of March; Calcutta, 23d February; and Hongkong, 15th February. The following is the letter of our Calcutta correApondent.- " CALCUTTA, FEB. 23. ': The fact of the fortnight is the ainexation of 'Oude. On the 4th inst. General Outram submitted to the King of Oude the draught of a treaty. The .precise character of this document is not known. It is certain, however, that it containedprovisions coni'eying the kingdom to the British Government. The Kinlg, who to the last moment disbelieved his danger, refused to sign. Hfe offered to surrender bis'Minister, whose great fault is his fidelity to himself, or to avert his sentence by any other concession; but he would not sign. The Resident p,ave him three days to consider Ihis resolution, and ihalted the troops outside Lucknow. On the 7th, the XWing adhering to his determination, the proclamation. was published. The great officials received formal intimation of the change of Government. T'he revenue officers were ordered to deliver up their papers. All military stores were seized, and the troops ordered to await instructions. A strong force 'Was encamped around Lucknlow, and the stations of different regiments have been previously deterained. The officers charg,ed with the task of regenerating Oude have already been collected, and in a few weeks the entire country will be under the control of British officers. As yet the revolution has been bloodless. The turbulent rabble of Lucknow, from whom alone danger is to be apprehended, seem to be thoroughly overawed. The best of the King's troops will be draughted into the eight new regiments of Oude Locals, and the remainder are unable, even if they have the inclination, to *oppose. *' You will receive, doubtless, statements of the universal indignationi of the inhabitants; of petiticns sioned by more men than Oude contains , of the Kin-'s determiination to address the Throne. They are all, with the exception of thle last, untrue. They are all circulated by 2 person well knowvn in the north-west, and who either is, or aspires to be, the Kin-s agent. The King, it is said, at first -threatened to go to England, and plead his cause in -perzon before Parliament. He has already, how-ever, chaDged his mind, and now talks of deputing an agent to act for him. The latter course will be more profitable to his advisers, and will therefore, in all probability, be adopted. " The prociamationitself has been much discussed here, and will be subjected, of course, to much criticism in Europe. It may be as well, therefore, to explain one or two facts upon which some misapprehension exists. The annexation of a coiuntrv ,solely on account of misgovernment is said to be an unwarrantable proceeding. We nmiht annex Naples on the same ground. It must be remembered that - Oude is by no means an independent State, as that phrase is *undestood in E:urope. The ancestor of the present King was totally defeated by Clive in 1765. EIe was then reinvested with the Soubahship, -on certain conditions, whichhe violated. He was again pardoned, and a succession of agreements followed, which ended finally in the treaty of 1801. By this document the Vizier agreed to surrender half of his dominions. In return the Government guaranteed his territories and slov er to him and his heirs for ever, on certain conditions. These were that his Government should ' conduce to the prosperity of his subjects,' dand that he should follow the advice of the British Resident. He has broken both glaringly. I have frequently forwarded to you accounts of the fearful condition to which the country has been reduced. For years it has, in truth, had no Government ,whatever. Every Chuckladar (Farmer-General) has done what he pleased, subject only to the necessity of bribing the eunuchs. His position was never secure, and he was therefore desirous only to fill his treasury as rapidly as possible. For this purpose he usually employed force, ravaging the country like the conimander of an invading army. It is not too much to say that the greater part of Oude suffered from this cause alone as much as the Principalities have stffered in the last three years from RuEsians and Austrians combined. The annexation is therefore only the exaction of the legitimate penalty on the bond. " The measure finds some opponents fiom another .circumstance. In the collection of treaties presented to Parliament in 1S53 is one called the treaty of 1837. This paper provides that, in the event of the Government of Oude becomning unendurably bad, the British shall administer, but not annex it. The prezent measure is tllerefore denounced as a breach of treaty. The trutlh is there is no such treaty in existence. A draught of one was presented to the K]ing, bat it v:as rejected by the Court of Directors, and never ratified. By what oversighit it crept into the officiol record the Directors can, perhaps, explain. " Be that as it may, since the treaty of 1801 the ILg has been keDt on the throne solely by our bayonets. The Hindoos would but for the British trccps have long since destroyed the dynasty. We all know what Oriental Princes have been from the tinie of Hazael downward. ,'hen originally adven-turers they have often been able and energetic rulers. "When born in the purple they have almost invariably regarded their subjects as born for their ani.senent and support. The only check upon -them is fear. The presence of a British force withdraws this check, and they and their favourites riot in every imaginable excess. WVe have therefore the disgrace of supporting by force of arms a Prince -whosetyranny is sofearful that even his own subjects would but for ns dethrone him. Underthis double Government the population has been reduced onehalf, the revenue has declined from two millions and a half to half a million, and Lucknow has become a oentre of demoralization to the north-west. It was neces&a'ry at all hazards to disconnect the British Government from a system productive of so much crime. There were only two ways of doing it. OIne is that -which has been tried; the other was to withdraw from Lucknow, and leave the kingdom to itself. The latter course was in the highest degree dangerous. The Hindoos, already irritated, would immediately have fallen on the DIussuluans. Thle effect would probably have been a general revolt throughout Tndia. There is scarcely a man in Oude wlho has not a relative in the army. The sepoys must have taken an acute interest in the struggle, and on opposite sides. The consequence would have been $a war a P'outra,mee in every cantonment in India. "T hese ideas are those of the immense majority of public men in India. The few who oppose are either guided by a dislike to Government or by the Hindeoized feeling once so prevalent among old Indians. Among the natives there is no feeling of any kind. A few baboos in Calcutta pretend to bemoan a native dynasty; but the masses do not even know that the annexation has taken place. The sepoys, it is understood, are most anxious for the change. They like a little peace and security at home, and they have as yet enjoyed neither. The body of the people are of the same mind, and only two classes scem to be really discontented. The people of Ltucknow look gloomy. The profuse expenditure of the Court benefited the shopkeepers, and the rabble have been accustomed to a license the British Goversnment cann.ot tolerate. A large section are engaged in ministering to the vices of the nobles, and their occunation is at an end. They are fond, too, of shows and pageants, and the British Governmentspendsits surplus on publieworks instead. Secondly, the flindoo Rajahs of the fron- tier have good cause for alarm. They have not paid their revenue for years. When asked for it they collect a force with which the King is unable to contend. Under a regular administration this kind of intestine warfare cannot be tolerated. They are therefore grumbling, and may perhaps try the experiment of contumacy. They have, however, no popuIar sympathy, and their retainers are no match for regular troops. A steady or prolonged resistance Is impossible, and in a few months I shall be able to report to you that the last landholder has agreed to pay his quota. " The first task of the new Government is to make the settlement. The. village system will pro- -bably be adopted, and the tax settled in the first instance for two years. This will allow time for a thorough survey of the country. " The countryhas been divided into four districts -Khyrabad, Lucknow, Gonda Bareytch, and Fyzabad, each pvresided over by a commnissioner, with three deputies. The military appointments are all filled up. Several officers from the army of this, his own Presidency, wi serve under General Ouitram in the new province. These are Captain Gell, who last year conducted the passage through Egypt of the cavalry for the Chimea; CaptainDaly, of the EaropeanFusileers, vho has seen service and commanded Irregulars in the Punjab; Lieutenants Johnson (present with one of the regiments of the line at Alma and Iakermann), Robert Hope Johnstone,. and three others. The Ring's army will probably be for the most part disbanded. The corps, however, commanded by Captain Barlow, -which did good service in the suppression of Ameer Ali, and is still in an excellent state of discipline, is spoken of as likely to remain intact, with the exception of its present European officers, who are to receive other and superior appointanents. No doubt is expressed of our being able to re-enlist the best men, the regular troops expressing the utmost willingness to enter our servace. " Next in importance to the annexation of Oude comes the alteration contemplated in the tenure of Madras. The Ryotwaree system of that Presidency has long since been pronounced a failure. It involves a direct annual settlement between Government and some 5,000,000peasants. This settlement was made by a calcuilation of the gross produce of each separate patch of land. Government then took 35 per cent. of this as its rent, and left the remainder to the cultivator. It was, of course, impossible for the European to examine each patch. He intristed the duty to natives, who made their power an instrument of extortion. The tenure, therefore, became wholly insecure. If a Ryot sunk a well his rent was raised. If he cut a small canal it was nearly doubled. There was, therefore, no possibility of improvement. Moreover, the land being divided among cottiers whose only capital was their labour, two bad seasons reduced them to the verge of starvation. In such cases the whole revenue was occasionally lost in remissions. Of course nobody ever grew rich, and in all the Presidency there are probably not 10 farmers worth 1,0001. The area of cultivation is only one-fifth the area of the Presidency, and shows no tendency to increase. Lord Harris therefore has proposed to modify this tenure. He would reduce the tax from 35 to 25 per cent. upon the gross produce. He would fix this proportion for 50 years, and thus allow the ryot the benefitof his own improvements. Moreover, he would change the rent in produce into a rent in specie, according to a sliding seale. The market price of grain is to be settled on the average of seven years, and the produce rent cormmuted, like tithes in England. The change -will involve the loss of nearly one-third of the land revenues of Madras. It is considered, however, that the temptation to clear new lanls will compensate for the loss, while the absence of remiqsions willmake the revenue more steady. At all events, it will increase the happiness and comfort of the people, which-bad as onr Indian statesmen are considered in England-is the first object of them all. The project must, of course, go home to England, where the reduction of revenue will perhaps be viewed with some alamn. "The Friend of Iindia has recentlypublished some remarkable statistics of Indian trade. One table in partictular will probably attract attention in Marklane. It is a table, obviously official, of the growth and extension of our -wheat trade.

" Five maunds equal one quarter. Hitherto it has been found alhost impossible to protect Indian wheat from the weevil. The difficulty has apparently been overcome, and Indian wheat will in all probability make no mean figure among our exports. Its ordlinary price in Calcutta is from 15s. to 18s. per quarter-it is much higher just now; and as soon as the railway is opened the supply will be quite unlimited. The Dooab alone can send a million of quarters, and the Dooab is to our wheatbearing land what the Essex hundreds are to all England. A very large exporter told me yesterday it might, with the railway open, be profitable to sell u-heat from the Dooab at -0s. a-quarter in London. The corn-factors can best understand the effect of sulch a trade. The supply, I repeat, is boundUess, and England may yet be independent for its supply of food both of America and Russia. "The increase on some other exports has also been very great. The export was 1855. 186. Increase.

It wolld be much larger but for oiur defective means of communication. The more distant provinces cannot send their supplies because the cost of carriage constumes the profit. The cultivation of jute, for instance, has scarcely begun. You will remark that the export of ricehere given includes only the export from Calcutta ; that from Akyab is much larger. Last year half a million sterling in silver was sent to Akyab for rice. This year the amount has been much greater, and I was told yesterday that the entire produce of the province had been purchased before the grain was ripe. To this, as to the wheat trade, there is no limit, except defective communication. " On the 13th inst. a publie meeting was held in Calcutta to discuss the most approprlate means of doing honour to Lord Dalhousie. Itwas most numerously attended. The speeches were unusually good. For once even the lanquid Anglo-Indians became enthusiastic, and an address and a marble statle were voted by acclamation. The address, written by Sir J. Colvile, expresses precisely the feeling of the community. As I have often told you, Lord Dalhousie, though by no means personally popular, is politically the idol of the community. They feel that his success is an honour to the country, and that his total freedom from all external influence has kept the Administration pure. To us who know the fearful condition of all native States his habit of annexation forms no ground of reproach while his occasional severit-y towards his subordi- nates is felt to be necessary in a country where one bad man can ruin an entire province. Lord Camning is expected on the 29th inst. He will be sworn in-on his landing, and on the 6th of March Lord Dalhousiewill leave India. " There is no news fromthe Santal districts. The official belief is that the rebellion is over, but nobody can speak with any confidence until the rains. Then, when the troops cannot move, will be the time of temptation for the savages." - The following is the letter of our Bombay correspondent:- " BOMBAY, 1.ECn 5.- "From the Nizam's country we have lately heard of something more than the usual amount of disorder. Gang robberies, attended with violence, are reported to be frequent both in the city and camp of Hyderabad; and those pests. of the country, the Riohilla mercenaries, have again been giving trouble, though this time our zoldiers have not been called -on to interfere further than forthe protection of their own cantonmaent. On the 23d of Februarya party of Rohillas, closely pursued by some Arab horsemen, took refuge in the enclosure -of a large tomb near the town of Jaulnah, and less than half-a-mile from the General Bazaar of the station, from which it was separated by the river, now nearly dry, and a strip of open ground. It afterwards turned out that the Rohillas had been in the service of a neighbouring Nawab, one of the Nizam's feudatories, who had dismissed them two months before, without making good to them their arrears of pay. In their extrenlity they betook themselves to plundering for their supjort and leviedcontTibutions upon thetowns and vilager.. The Nawab despatchec1his Arab horse to extirpate the body of men whom his own iniustice had made a band of robbers, and for two months had the chaze continued, varied only by one slight skirmish, in which the Arabs were worsted. This time the pursuers had their revenge. When night fell the RohiLas broke from their cover, and were immediately set upon by the Arabs. The contending, partiesstraggled across theriver andltheopenground, the Rohillas retreating towards the main street of the bazaar; but here they found their passage barred by a partv of the 2d Madras Cavalry, and, being thus placed between two fires, they made a feeble attempt to get through the troopers, during which the officer in command was slig,htly wounded, and then dispersed in all directions. Thirteen of them were killed and many wounded, while one man only fell on the side of the Arabs. lIe was slain in a hand-to-hand fight by a Rohilla, who himself bore many marks of his adversary's skill. My informant,-one of the officers of the station,-like all who have witnessed the effects of similar affrays in the Deccan and elsewhere in India' espresses himself as much impressed by the proofs of the exceeding sharpness of the swords and of the de.xterity of the hands that wielded them. The next day the Aabs went away after the survivors. The dead were disposed of, the wounded tended, and the stationresumed its wonted quiet. But there are always Rohillas in the neighbourhood; and, under the present feeble Government, petty outbreaks are continually to be anticipated. 'Oude,' concludes my correspondent, 'was not in a worse state than this wretched Hyderabad country.' " The latest communications from Cabul chronicle at some length the events of Dost Mahomed's march to Candahar and of his stay at that capital. Regardless, as it would seem, of affairs at Herat, or perhaps under no immediate apprehension of inconvenience from that quarter, the old chief has been devoting his energy and astuteness towards the attainment of his long cherished designs upon Candahar. Before he hiLself appeared on the scene things had not gone on favourably for his cause. While he was yet on the march one of his younger sons preceded him to Candahar, where his arrogance brought on a quarrel with the inhabitants, in the course of which he was driven out of the city, inflicting, however. more loss than he sustained. The Dost, on receiving a deputation from the city complaining of his son's conduct, hastened to send for the young man, Sheer 4Ai Khan by name, patched up a reconciliation between the parties, and dismissed them, himself following with all speed. Within Candahar there was dissension between the Dost's brother and his nephew, Rahumdil Khan and Mlahomed Sadeek, of which Sheer Ali, encamped without the walls, took advantage to surprise and retain possession of one of the gates as soon as the near approach of the Ameer was announced. Mahomed Sadeek fled, and the Dost entered the city, and obtaining from his old and feeble brother, Rahumdil, all the property of the late chief, le became vrtually if not ostensibly, master of the place. Mahomed Sadeek, his nephew, was still at large, however, and to induce him to come in the float sent to him his son, Eyder lhan (his Envoy to us last year), whom Mahomed eluded, first by excuses, and finally by precipitate fiight to Persia. Though concerned that this member of his late brother's fanmily should have escaped him, the Dost has not slackened in his arrangements forthe portioning out and government of his new territory, which may probably be now considered as attached to Cabul, for the life at least of the present ruler. "Of local newsthereis little ornothing of interest. A meeting has been held to vote a parting address to Lord Dalhousie, which was less fully attended than might have been expected. An address was read and adopted, which recognized the great abilities of the Governor-General, his successful termination of great wars, the introduction during his proconsulate of the railroad and the electric telegraph, of a cheap postage and a national system of education, and which, while avowing frankly a dissent from his views on some points, proclaims him ' one of the most able energetic, and honest statesmen to whom the destinies of India have been intrusted.' Similar addresses have been voted at the other Presidencies. Lord Dalhousie is expected to leave Calcutta about the 7th inst. Lord Canning, on his way to the seat of supreme government, spent a week at Madras, and, as we learn by telegraphic message, was sworn in Governor-General at Calcutta on the 1st. " Sir William and Lady Gomm arrived yesterday froraKurrachee, on their way home, and are staying with Lord Elphinstone. Shortly after Sir William's departure the head-quarter staff of the army vwill be transferred to Mahabuleshwar. " Trade has somewhat improved, and the moneymarket is easier. Exchange on England has slightly declined." CHINA. (rso3X our owN COBBESPOI'DMi.) HONKGKONG, FEB. 15. The London mail of the 10th of December was received on the 30th of January per steamer Cadiz, which returns to-day with the outward maiL. Mr. Chisholm Anstey ariived per the Cadiz, and has been sworn in as Her Majesty'sAttorney-General for this colony. Political events have been inimportant. We have received no well-authenticated intelligence from the interior, but report speaks of the ascendancy of the Imperial cause in the Oonam province, from which the rebels are said to be again retiring towards Kwangsi. Regarding the rebellion in the more northern provinces we have no information whatever. The Chinese New Year's-day (6th instant) has passed quietly, both here and in Canton. The general settlement of accounts among native nierchants has been effected without difficulty, and, although money was somewhat in demand for a time, we hear of-no failures, which is satisfactory. Transactions in imports have beento a fair extent, considering the cessation from business during theholydays. Yarn and shirtings are quoted somewhat lower, in consequence of some holders having been desirous to realize and avail themselves of the advance in exchange to make remittances. The general tone of the market is healthy. Iron has advanced considerably, and tin plates have been in demand. Rice is somewhat scarce and dearer. The tea market has been active. As theNew Year drew nigh dealers evinced an anxiety to realize, and prices gradually gave way to a point which induced operations in old Congou to the extent of 33 chops. Of new Congou only two chops have been settled for at about previous rates. There have been no arrivals from the interior during the past month. In scented teas only a small business has been done, but greens have been taken more freely for the American market. In raw silk we have no salez to mention. Stocks and quotations are unaltered. Sugar has been inquired for at enhanced rates, andshipments have been made to Europe. The new crop is said to be a small one. Freights are steady, and tonnage ample. Shanghai advices are to the 7th instant. Imports have been taklen freely at an advance for some descriptions. In manufactured goods stocks are small. In tea a moderate business has been: transacted at about former rates. The-silk market has been q-aiet, and quotations show little alteration. Five'vessels have sailed for Great Britain during the month. The question of a change int currency has. lately occulpied much attention. lt may be reme'mbered that in August last (after :considerable agitation of the question on-the part of the foreign community, and it was understood at the istance of the Con' suls of the three treaty Powers) Chaou, the super-: intendent of -Customs at Shanghai, issued au edict decreeing that from the commencement of the present China'. new- year all dollars should circulate without distinction, exceptas regards their intrinsic purity of silver; and to enforce obedience on the part of, Chinese severe paims and penalties were ceclared against al who might be found ty of non-comuliance. -This most.arbitray manner of dealing wit-h, such a question excited considerable dissatisfaction and -discontent among both Chinese and foreigners, and an influential number of the latter - addressed a remonstrance to the Constl, whicb, however, - was productive of no altertion in the obnoxious clauses of the Taoutae'sproclamation. The matter remained in statu, ql!o until the approach of the Chinese new year revived public attention. A numerous meeting of foreign residents favour- able to a change of currency wfas held on the 31st of January, and it was resolved by those present that the adoption of the Mlexican dollar as the money of account, instead of the old Carolus dollar, would be beneficial to commerce; and they therefore agreed to treat the Mexican dollar as the doll&> of account, and, as far as practicable, ccontract sales and make purchases in that currency. On the other side of this question we find many of the oldest and most influential firma and banks, wvho, although ready to admnit the anomalous position of the present so-called currency, are opposed to the measure by which it is purposed to effect a change. The real currency of China being copper cash, it is obvious that other coins merely possess a value relative thereto, whatever may be the rate of premium or discount, which is regulated in this, as in other matters, by supply and demnand. It is argued, therefore, that the mere nominal change of one dollarfor another is more likely to produce confusion than benefit; that while the Carolus dollar continues to be the only foreign coin current among the Chinese, and the coin which alone is brought from or taken to the interior for direct commercial investments, it must be expected to maintain a high market value ; but it is apparently a loss to the Chinese, who receive it so much above its intrinsic worth, rather than a disadvantage to the foreigner. Moreover, the practical inconvenience of the Carolus dollar, as a measure of value, is not so great as has been frequently represented. As much tea or silk and as much pure silver can be purchased in Shanglhai for a given amount of sterling or a Mexican dollar as in Canton. It is held by those to whom we have alluded as the opposers of the measure that any effective change must originate with the Chinese in the interior provinces, and that, as the power of the Taoutae of Shanghai is merely local, the effect produced must be the same, and the attempt to enforce compliance by violent means is at variance with justice and all the rules of commerce. On this point a letter was addressed by the secretary of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, inquiring as to the bearing of the Taoutae's proclamation upon dealingsbetween foreign and native merchants, more especially in cases where the Carolus dollar may be specifically mentioned as the medium of payment. The following reply created considerable surprise and no little dissatisfaction, maintaining, as it does, that a bond fide transaction for Carolus dollars may be legally repudiated by either party -who may be dishonest enough to do so:- " British Consulate, Shanghai, Nov. 1, 1855. "Sir,-Referring to yourletter of the 28th ultimo, requesting me to furnish, fortheinformation of theComaittee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, explanations on certain points involved in the proclamation lately issued by the Taoutae, declaring certain changes in the currency of this port, to take effect the ensuing Chinese new year, I have to ..form you, in reply to the firAt query proposed, as 'to contracts entered into in the present current coin but runeig beyond that date,' that, in my opinion, aU contracts entered into previous to the date of the proclamation wiiU not be affected by it; and to the second, 'as to contracts entered into subsequently to the above date, wherein the Carolus dollar may be specifically mentioned as the medium of payment,' that the spirit of such contract cannot override the letter of the proclamation, which distinctly provides for the equalization of dollars, and makes them a legal tender at the Government standard of value. " I am, &c., I D. R. BOBERTSONg We have heard that the letter has been since withdrawn by the Consul. Some settlement of this general question is highly desirable, as the present doubtful state of affairs tends to unsettle trade. Foochow dates are to the 4th instant. There is little change intheprice of tea. The lowest descriptions of sound common Congou may be quoted about i tael lower, but full rates"are realized for the better qualities. The stock on the market consisted of 10,000 to 11,000 chests, al, with few exceptions, being low to sound common Congou. A considerable quantity of tea in foreign hands was waiting shipment, but from the country little more was expected. One vessel had sailed for London, and two remained m the berth. Amoy.-We have advices to the 8th instant. There had been a dull market during the month, and imports have declined, with accumulating stocks. From Manilla our latest date is the 7th instant. The new sugars were not at market. Opening prices were likely to be high. Exchange on London, six months' sight, 4s. 84d. per dollar. Our latest dates are .-From England, 10th December; Calcutta, 20th January; Bombay, 14th January; Singapore, 29th January; Manilla, 7th February ; Sydney, 8th December; M1elbourne, 10th December; Shanghai, 7th February. Exchanlge on England.-5s. to 5s. 01d. in Canton; 6s. 7d. to 6Is. 71d. in Shanghai. COIMERCIAL TINTELIJGENCE. CALCUTTA MARKETS. (From the Calcutta Star of Feb. 22.) The week under, notice has been characterized by much dullness and want of animation, which the advices last come to hand are calculated rather to increase. Indigo has still continued in good favour, and public sales have followed each other in rapid succession, while prices have been steadilymaintained. Sugars do not indicate much change, but have moved away moderately. Saltpetre continues in a very depressed condition, and prices a shade easier. A moderate amount of business has been on foot in rice, and prices of this article too are lower. Raw silk is steady in value, but only dealt in moderately. In silk piece goods hardly anything appears. Shell lac and lac dye have been both quiet, owing to reduced stocks. Hides are in -ood request, and value is well supported. Linseed has been more inquired after,which has causedits value to advance a shade. Mustard seed remained at former quotations. Jute is in good demand, and at former prices. In other goods of minor consequence we notice no alteration; the general tendency we may pronounce as downward. The import market has been steadily improving ; the improvement, however, is but _radual. Operations have been on a very fair scale, considering all circumstances; and the business done has been principally in gray goods, for which demand is good, while for all bleached it is dull. Mule twist has been moving steadily forward at full previous prices. In metals we observe no change towards improvement. In the money-market we can notice no improvement; things continue in the same depressed and immoveable position as before. In the rates of discount and interest no alteration has taken place, nor do we anticipate any will for some tine to come. There has been some little fluctuation in the value of Government securities dnring the period under review. Present qnotations are Co.'s Fours rs. 18 5 to 16 ; Siccas 17 S and New Fives 4 to 8 annas per cent. We notice no great change in the value of any joint shares. It is reported that some India Generals have recently sold at 1,130. Ekchange.-A fair amount of businems appears to have been done for the outgoing mail at 2 2A to 2 2{ for credit bills, and 2 2i to 2 21 for document paper at six months' sight. We do not anticipate any immediate change. Freights.-Hardly any change appears in the rates of homewvard freightage during the penod under notice. Consignees have shown much firmness, which has caused rates to maintain their position, but hatended to cripplebusiness. The increasing dullness of the produce market cannot but tend greatly to afect the rates of freight. We may conse- Luently pronounce them as unsteady, and with a declining tendency. InzOxRS FROMr EusoPE. British Cotton Piece Goods.-The general features of these remain unchanged; the improving tendency has continued, and graduaUy an improving business has been doing. The up-country accounts continue of a favourable character, and business promises soon to be doing on a more animated scale. Metal.-Copper has sold, sheathing at 53r., old at 38r., nail at 44r. per md. Iron has declined a shade in value. Spelter indicates improvement and an improving tendency. BOMBAY .MARKET, IFROa THE 17TH OF FEBRUARY TO TE 4TIr OF AL&RCH. The Overland Mail of the 26th of January reached Bombay on the 22d of February, by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Malta. i Our money-market for the past fortnight has become, if anything, a little easier, and, although the banks have iot lowered their rates of interest, yet we are of opinion that present rates must give, way soond, from the fact of large lmportations of bar silver continuing to arrive by the Suez steamers. The Commercial Bank directors have declared a divideudal the rate of 7 per cent. per annum for the past halfyear. Government and other securities have improved considerably. Imports.-A fair amount of business has been done in cotton piebe goods. A ccounts received b, last mail had tho effect of inducing holders to become firm; and gray goods of nearly all descriptions immediately advanced in value. Gray MadapoXlanis- have advanced from A to I anna per piece, and all descriptions are in good inquiiry. Grayf jaconots are in fair inquiry. *BIeached goods, 'ith few exceptions, are in better re- quest. -. hap -Cotton Yarns.-The marketha been steady, and prices of mule20 to 60 have slightly advanced, as has also 30 water. Ded orange is in moderate inquiry, but Turkey red iidull. Metals.-For English bar iron, sheet, and hoop there is some inquiry; nailrod, both round and square, is also in demand, and has advanced. Swedish bar iron and steel, although in fair inquiry. remain at former quotations.

Marine Stores.-For canvass, corge eFaints, and eln twrine, and for oil of linseedand apirits trpnt!'nM is a fai r demand. t t Beer.-None in wood has as yet been received; 1,00o dozens in bottles have sold at 44r. a-dozen. Spirits.-:For brandy in bottle there is a fair inquiry * in wood brandy is dulL Bottles, empty, are in fair demand. Woollens.-We have no sales to report; ladies' cloth is now in better inquiry. EXPORTS. Cotton Wool.-The market has been very active, and on the new crops, of which supplies have beea freely received, there has been an advance in pries; the old crops have declined in consequence of inferior cquality-only DIholera and Mangrole of these are, fit for shipment, and wo quote for them 80 to 85 and 74 to 75 rs. per candy; for new cotton the qnotations are for Surat and Broach rs. 97 to 98, and for Dhollera and Oomrawutty rs. 92 to 93 per candy. Oil Seed.-A.I descriptions are in good demand. Linseed has been purchased on the spotat 4.10 per cwt., and to arrive 4.8. We quote -for teel 25,Ur.; rape, Sindee, 34 Guzerat, 3.14; Niger, 18r. Cochineal continues in moderato inquiry, but without any change in value. Pepper.-Both Bhutcole and Tellicherry are scarce, and have advanced in value. Opium has considerably advanced in value, owing to some gambling going on at present in the Bazaar, and we now quote for Mfundleisur TS. ,10.0 to ,105, and for Indore ra. 1,090 to 1,095 per chest. The Peninsular and Oriental steamer Madras, which leaves this day for China, takes awvay 1X669.& chests. The mail steamer having brought from Europe upwards of 20 lacs in bullion, the rate vas driven down to 2s. lid. for first-class paper; it has since ralied, and -we quote as the rate of the day 2s. 2d. to 2s. 2@d. On Calcutta, 60 days' sight, 9SAr. to 99r. On China, 60 days' sight, 223r. Freights are firm at 41. 2s. 6d. to 41. 5s. per ton for cotton1 to London and Liverpool.

The Chinese Nevw Year's-day passed over quietly, and the settlement of accounts usual at this season was most satisfactory. Looking to the interruption of the holydays, afair business has been done in Canton in manufactures, and the tone of the market is good. Cotton has declined 2 to 4 mace.

DUST, OH! TO TIE EDITOI OF THE TIMES. Sir,-AUow me to express my thanks for the pubEcity yon havel given to my complaint, and at the same timie to aunounce the fact that Mr. Thlwaites, or the Westminster District Board of Works, or Sir Benjamin Hall, or all of them together, have actually to-day watered the road from Great George-street to Victoria-street. It is true that this duty has been very scantily performed, the water. carts having passed over the ground in haste, with a sprinkle which reminds one of the passage in the Greek: tragedian, wvhere a passer-by is described as casting a handful of dust on a corso to escapo poUution. Bat, if our watering to-day has been just enough to speak of, practice makes perfect; and I have little doubt that the auxthorities will soon take as naturally to watering this great thoroughfare twice a-day, Sundays included, as ducl;ings to a pond. If they do not, I hope you will again allow me a corner in your columns to expose their shortcomings. In the mean time allow me to repeat my acknowledgments at in L nlntr RABITANS IU SICCO.. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIfIES. Sir,-As one likely to have some voice in the question of laying the dust in Westminster, allow me to, state that the nuisance complained of by your correspondent, " Eabitausg in Sicco," is not at all exaggerated by him. The building in which I am accustomed to meet with my brothers on the bench is a prey to dust from year's end to years end, as the thoroughfare in which it is situated seems to be considered a parochial "2No-man's-land." I care very little who is to blime, but that some one is to blame is painfully evident. Under these circumstances, should this question come before me in the way of summons for disputed rates, it must be a very strong act of Parliament indeed which will compel me to pronounce the ratepayer liable to pay for services which are never performed. - YnnrI -r A MrDDLESEX AGISTRATE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TnEES. Sir,-Your paper of this date- contains a letter from a correspondent who does not give his name, but signs himself "A Civil Engineer and Architect." Ho denies the statement of M1r. Thwaites, wlo said that the liability, to water the roads, complained of by " Habitans in Sicco," rested with the Westminster Local Board of Worls, and says,-" The favoured district is under the parental despotism of Sir B. Hall the President of Her 3Majesty's Commissioners of woods and Works." He then adds, "No doubt the hon. member for Marylebone, wlvo was so very severe npon the mode in which parochial authorities neglected the performanceof their duties, wouldat once remedy the evil complained of, if it were officially brought before him in due red-tape form." The fact of the case is simply this :-The district is not under the control or supervision of the Office of Works, but is, as Mr. Thwaites stated, under th Westminster Loeal Board of Works. Tho only part of the metropolis which is under the Office of Works is that lying betwveen Bridge. street and Abingdon-street. It is regularly Watered, and no complaint has ever been made in reference to it. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, A. D. BERRPWGTON. i Office of WVorks, April 2.
&ATE XOF BYPT. I_ (nF-ox ovit owx NcORzION-nl?-ii ALEXA,'DRIA, MI'.= Z. The Tndia and China mails arrived at Suez on tho 18th, and at Alexandria on the 21st. The Euxine, with the Southampton mai of the 4th of March, arrived off this harbour on the morning of the20th; but, in consequence of very stormy weather, did not get in before the 21st. The Alhambra, with the overland mail of the 10th of MIarch, due here from MErseilles on the 19th, has not yet arnved, and the steamer at Suez is awaiting her arrival. A French steamer leaves to-day for Malta and Marseilles. The Viceroy Said Pasha has gone up to Cairo to take possession of a paLace on the Nile he has jusc bought from one of his nephew The deepening, of the bed of the canal which bdiZnects Alexandria with the Nile, and which was to have been done in February, has by order of .the Viceroy been put off indefinitely, although in the beginning of this month several thousand Egyptians had been collected there and the necessary preparations made to carry out the work. The plea given for this sudden change is that there is still too much water in the calnal, and that it would cause great mortality among the people workdng at it; but this might have been foreseen, and, if really a good reason, the peasants should not have been dragged away from their own field-work just af the time of gathering in their crops, and made to bring their own provisions from great distances, to be told that they were now to return to their villages-as well as they can, and that they will have to come back to the canal in the course of the summer. The canal in question is of vital importance to Alexandria and the trade of Egypt, as by it all the produce is brought down from the interior. It has now been virtually closed since January, but still Said Pasha does not seem to think it of any consequence, nor does he consider the sufferings he thus heaps. upon thepoor inhabitants. There is no doult that the work might have been effected just no*, and that with a little precaution and some attenition to the wants of the men there would not have been any particular mortality among them. The works of the, line of railway from Alexandria to 31areotis, 17 miles in the Desert to the westward of the town, have been begun. The engineer of the Cairo and Suez Railroad and some of his staf have been ordered away from that important line to attend to the Mareotis Railway, which wvill never be of use to the country, and will in all probability be abandoned on Said Pasha's death, as it leads to an uninhabited, uncultivated, and useless spot. It is thus that a large sum of money wil be literally thrown away, while His Highness, on the plea of a deficiency of revenue, has cut down by one quarter the salaries of al those who arein his service. No public notice has been tak-en here as yet of the official acceptance by the Sultan of the propositions in the fourth point of the Peace Conferences and of the Imperial decree of the 1Sth of February. Perhaps Said Pasha is waiting that it may be ofli- aialy communicated to him from Constantinople. MIehemet ANli in his time had the intelligence to see that his existence and power depended in a great measure upon the good opinion of Europe, and the general principles laid down in the Imperial decree have long been tacitly recognized in Egypt. The Christians have not been subjected to more rigorous laws than the Mahomedans, and many of them are in the army. No difficulties have been made with regard to the possession of landed property by Europeans, though the latter hitherto have felt some uncertainty as to their titles. Christian churches have been raised in Egypt wherever they were required without molestation, and Mehemet Ali generally made a gift of the ground for their erection. The Englsh Protestant church occupies a most prominent position in the great square of Alexandria, the Roman Catholics have two churches, and the Greeks have just completed a very fine large church, and all tolli their own bells.' The English Consul of Alexandria, backed by our Consul-General, has recently refused to marry a Protestant English girl to a Mahomedan Egyptian, though bomn are anxious to be united. The pl given is that the Egyptian is not subject to the authority of the British Consul, and therefore by the laws of his own country he might divorce his English wvife the day after marriage, or take other wi,ves besidesherself, and the Consul would have no power to protect the girL But independently of this reason our Consuls are animated with the desire of discountenancing the marriage of Englishwomen with natives of this country, for they lead to misery and disappointment on the part of the wives. The Egyptians who are sent to England for their education are generally taken from the lower classes, and, though liberally provided for while in England, on their return to this country they have to begin life on a very low scale, with a pittance of seldom more than GOI. yearly. Some parents in England, seeing the Egyptians abundantly supplied ;with everything, imagine they must hold high rank in their own countrv, and- do not hesitate in giving them their daughtirs in marriage. But these marriages, though binding on the part of the women, are not binding on the part of the Egyptians, who are subject only to the laws of their own country; and the men, though they may have imbibed some civilized ideas while in England, soon return to their natural propensities, and meglect their English wives, or do not hesitate to make additions to their harem, and the wives bitterly regret the step they have taken. 3I. Alphonse de Rothschild, of Paris, arrived here from Constantinople on the 13th, and through the influence of the Fench Consul the Viceroy has placed a steamer at his disposal to visit the upper country. Most of the travellers who have spent the winter in Upper Egypt h ave returned to Cairo, and are leaving for Syria, either by way of the Desert or by sea from Alexandria to Jaffa. Lord Portarlington has been making a protracted stay at Ipsamnblul, in Nubia, excavatingantiquities. Lord George Pailet is gone to the Crimea, on a visit to his brother. Lady Pirie embarks for Jaffa by the French steamer to-morrow. Trade is particularly dull in Alexandria. Vessels go away empty, or get miserably low freights-3s. to 4s. per quarter-as there is little or no produlce in the place for shipment; the canal being closed, none can be brought down. Cotton is almost the only article in tolerable abundance, as it is brought down from Atfeh and across from Rosetta on camels' backs. Exchange keeps up at 1004 piastersperpound sterling, and, the sovereign being worth 101k, it does not answer to import specie, the expenses on which amount to 2k per cent. Letters from Jerusalem state that the new Pasha of that province is animated with the most liberal sentiments, and is thoroughly carrying out the principles lately adopted at Constantinople of liberality towards all creeds and denominations of people, with a desire to ameliorate the condition of the inhabitants. The Pasha of Jerusalem and his suite attended divine service in the English church on Epiphany Sunday, and visited the English hospital and the English school, leaving handsome donations for each. Some disturbances, attended with bloodshed, having occurred in the district of Nablous, in consequence ot tihe tiovernor of the district being very obnoxious to the inhabitants, the Pasha of Jerusalemu deposed the Governor, who was a Turk, anld installed a native in his stead, .wrhieh has given general satisfaction. The Pasha has been visiting I the villages-and towvns under his authority-a thing w which was never done before by anyof hisprede cessors. A good deal of rain had fallen in Svria, so that the crops will not suffer so much as was anticipated from the drought in the early part of the winter. The Greeks are cultivating land to a great extent in and about Jerusalem, planting olive and mulberry trees, and building silk-mills. They have lately made a very good road to the Convent of the Cross, which has been almnost rebuilt, and where they-have a College. Almost alltravellers now succeed in visiting the Great MIosque of Omar, the site of the Temjple, though they have to make large presentsfor-the privilege. The Jews, however, are still unwilling to enter the Temple, from fear of defiling it, because they believe that the Ark of the Covenant, containing the two Tables of Stone, was buried on thit spot by Jeremtah when Judah was carried away captive to B3abylon. The excavations under the city of Jerusalem are also frequently explored; but the entrance, being exceedingly narrow and low, is very difficult. These excavations are of very great e:tent, and are formed into vast arched chambers, which seem to have been used as a quarry to supply the materials for the wls of the Temple,
MONY,V-,lLZtand CITY INTELLIGRZYCE. Wednesday Evenng. - In consequence of the rather heavy reaction on the Paris Bourse the English funds opened this moxning with diminished buoyancy, but prices were Eubsequently maintained with steadiness, although the amount of business was not extensive. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 93 to J., were first quoted 92bZ to 93b'. Throughout the greater part of the day there were buyers at 93, and the last official tranactions were at 93 to i for money,' and 931' to i for the 10th inst. Fior the account on the 5th of M1ay the closing price was 93b to i, but after regular hours there w.as a decline of an eig,hth. Consol scrip left off at 3,1 premium; India bonds, lls, to Cs. discount; Excchequer-bonds, 981- to i; and Exchequer-bills (March) is. to 3s. premiumn, (June) 2s. dliscount to par. In2 the Stock-Exchange to-day There was an ample supply of money at 6 per cent. At the Bank of England the demand is beli'eved to have been lig,ht, and in the general discount-market, although there was considerable activity, t-he tendency w;as towamrds increased ease. There wvas increased activity in foreign securities at a further advance in prices. Tlurkish and MIexican wtere principally purchased, but the full improvement wias not altogether nnaintainedl. Turkish Six per Cents, wvere dealt in at 202k for money, and 102, 102j, i., 103j, and l02$ for the account. The transactions in the Four per Cent. Guaranteed were at 102 for money, and l020- and 102 for the account. The other bargainls comprnsed :-Brazilian, 99 and 100; the Newv, 98; Buenos A<yres, 60; Ohilian Six per Cents., i0il ana 102; Danish Three per Cents., S and 84k; Eculador New Consolidated, 14t; MWexican, 2O3, 1G, i, 5, 22, and 2l5; Peruvian :Four-and-a-1talf per Cents., 78A; Rfussian F?ive per Cents., for account, 105; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 94t; Sardinian Five per Cents., 95 and 96; Spanish Three per Cents., 4S-, 46k, and i; the New Deferred', for account, 25, '25k, and 25; Pasnive, 7A; Venezuela, 29X; Duteh tnwo-and-a-Half per Cents., 63'. and 64; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 29l, 94, and 93X. Some transactions in Newv South WVales Government Bonds took place at 96i. The corn-market this morning wias again without alteration. The liquidation having passed off, the prices from the Paris'Bourse tbis evening showv a recovery of a half per cent., the Three per Cents, having closed at 72f. ,Oc. for money, and 73f£ 60c. for the new. account at the end of the presen.t month. On the subject of the competition of French .against British fire insurance offices, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced a bill which he appears to consider will prevent French policies from being undertaken here wlithout the payment of the Government duty. The general belief is not merely that the me.asure will prove futile, but that, shortof a reduction of duty, no method eanbe devised wvhich wo-uld be likely to prove effectual. The case stands thus .-English isurances are liable to a duty of 3s. per cent. In France there is no duty. The Parisian office La Fiance has consequently established an agency here, where policies, which at otu offices would be chnarged 4s. 6d. per cent. (namely, is. 6d. premium and 3s. duty), may be effected at 2s. 6d. per cent., the French office, even upon these terms, getting Is. per cent, more than the Eng,lishl for its risk, and the assurer, at the same time, saving 2s. To meet this the Ch.ancel'lor of the Exchequer proposes to make all agencies effectingi insurances in this country liable to the same duty as the regular British offices. It is contended, however, that the insurance is not effected by the agent, whose functions arecsimply those of facilitating the arrangements between the insurer and the Paris estsab'lishment. sMoreos-er, the existence of an agency here is not essential, and nothing can prevent an iEnglishman writing to France to enter into any contract that may be in conformity with the laws of that countryv. Of cour-se, in case of a cl.aim being disputed, his remedy would lie only in the French courts, but there is no reason to suppose he wvould fail to obtain justice there as speedily and eflectuaUly as in our own. Indeed, under the circumstances, a disposition mnight possibly grow up to manifest generally a favourable leaning t.o the foreigner, and, at all events, the ofiices themsels-es being fullly awvare that the continuance of the business wvould depend mainly on the honoulr and liberality with which it wvas carred on, would be certain to avoid vexatious litigation, wvhile they wrould also be able to be less rigid than OUr' own, since they wiould receive 2s. 6d. instead of Is. Gd. premium. Under these circtumstances, the i view is that a redaction of the duty from 3s. to is. wtill be the only plan to prevent this immense and profitable branch of business being gradually transferred from London to Paris. lfndoubtedly the question as regards its effect on thte revenue is serious, the aggregate annual sumn derived by the Government from this source being about 1,2aO,OOOI. But the immediate loss wrould probably soon be made up by the increase of policies, and even if this woere not the case the fact must be recognlized, that the matter is one of choice between keeping any portion of these receipts and suffering them gradually to be lost altogether. In France it is asserted seven-eighths of the owvners of house property effect insurances, wrhile in iEngland the resut of the duty is to keep the proportion .^t one-third. There is, therefore, good room for the revenue to recover from a reduction, and apart from. other considerations and above themi all wvould be the advantage of doing away with the discouragement which the tax at its present point offers to the exercise of that kind of prudence which in a commercial country should be cultivated as most essentiaL. Some anx;iety prevails among the shipping interest on the question whether vessels will be allowedl to clear for Russian ports before the ratifications of the treaty of peace, or are to be subjected to the blockade up to that time. At present the Custom-house will not pass them, but a large number have recently been chcartered and despatehed to Constantinople on the condition that, if the blockade should not have ceased wiithin a specified nulmber of days after their arriv.al at that city, the contract is to be void. Some notice from the Government on the subject is daily looked for, and, meanwrhile, several ships have been put on the berth for Russian ports, at Hull1, London, and elsewshere. Ascording to the last accowunts from St. Petersblurg, large transactions w-ere beinlg entered inlto for the early shipment of tallon-, seed, hemp, flax, &c. In the Black Sea and the Sea of Azoff' the stocks of wvheat available up to the next h.arvest are thoug,ht not to exceed 1,l000,000 quarters, and exports~ wrill likewvise be ! obstructed by the necessity for reorganising all the ordin.ar means of transport. The Russian prohibition against the export of grain iis also still in force. This is expected, however, to be inmmediately rescinded, and, if existing prices in England should be maintained, it is probable they will have thle usual effect of demon2strating that the extent of the supplies and of the means for getting them off have in some degree been underrated. The commercial accounts from India and China to-day are more favourable than for a long time past. At Bombay the money-market has become easier, and a fair amolunt of business has been transacted at an advance both in Manmchester goods and mnetals. At Calcutta. also, the market is steadily improving, while at the Chiniese ports the operations have been numerous, at fill prices; tlle stock,s on hand, especially at Shanglhai, being low. The subjoined account of the coiuse adopted at Shang,hai with regard to the currency is from Messrs. Cramptons, Hanbiuy, and Co.:- " The chief item of news to report is the almost universal adoption of the Mexican dollar currency by the merchants of this port, which change is to take place from to-day, being the conumencement of the Chinese newv year. AU accounts, therefore, will have to be transferred to the new culrrency by placing either to the debit or credit of aU outstanding accounts the rate of premiiumi 'the Carolus dollar is foEnd to bear, according to the decision of a committee of our local brokers. We think, however. that the Carolus dollar will still maintain a relative high rate of premium,un and the transactions among the Chinese themselves in the silk and tea districts will be made in the old currency, the change effected being for the present.merely local." The annexed on the leather-market during the past month is from the circular of Messrs. Streatfield, Laurence, and Mortinsore - " The leather-market has been -well supplied with most articles during the past month. Although there was every probability that. the recent negotiations at Paris would terminate in a treaty of peace, and that, consequently, the comsnmption of leather would ultimately be much diminished, the transactions have been more extensive' thaa could be anticipated, and, with few exceptions, quotations are well sustained. This- state of the market may no doubt be attributed to the enormous consumption of the last two ywelc, hici has prevented any accumulation of stock in the Dands of tanners, and at the same timie the uncertainty of the duration of the war induced buyers to purchase only such quaniiies as their immediate orders required. Urnder such Oircums ances the trade may be regarded ax in a healthy condition, and that forthcoming supplies will not be found more than adequate to the probable consumption." The dividends on the Canada Six per Cent. Debentures andon the Montreal City Six per Cent. Debentures have been advertised for ptyment.
RAILWAY AND ^MIVIfG SHARES. Wednesday Evening. The railway-market was animated, and in some cases there was a further advance. Guaranteed and foreign descriptions were largely dealt in, the preference for the maoment being given to the various Indiai lines. London ancd County Bank sharesr opened at 32, and, having gradually declined to 29k, finally closed 301. In Australian Agricultural there was an extraordinary rise, and Peel River also improved. Bank of Egypt shares left off l to :pm.; Ottoman Bank, 18 to i pm.; WVestern of London, 2 to 1 dis.; Parms, 3 to 2 dis.; Alliance iBank> 1 dis. to par; and National Discount Company, i (lis. to - pm.

TRADE REPORT. Wednesday Evening. SUAuR.-Although there was less life in the public sales to-day, there was demand sufficient to take off the 5,170 bags Mauritius, as follows :--Crystallized, 41s. Gd. to 46s. 6d. ; gray, 44s. to 45s. ; low to good yellow, 41s. to 44s. 1,400 bags brown and white Pernamns realized 40s.: to 44s. 6d.; and 402 boxes yellow lHavmnnah sold at 39s. 6d. to 49s. 142 hogsheads foreign Muscovado and 1,137 baskets Java were nearly aU withdrawn. 500 boxes yeUow Havannah have been diiposed of privately, and a resale of cargo of brown Pernams bas been effected at 25s. 4J d. Of West India 576 hogsheads have changed hands. RIcE.-The demand is very slack even at easier terms, and the whole of 4,400 bags Java at public sale were with. drawn at 12s. to15s. per cent.; subsequently however, rather more than one-third has found buyers slightly under the buiying-in rates. Privately, about 4,000 bags are reported to have been sold, of which 1,365 bags w ere good Ballam, now in deck, at Ss. 6d. per cwt. over shipside. The remainder consisted of fair to good bold white Bengal, at 10s. 6d. to 12s. 9d. per cwt.; and a small quantity of MIoonghy, at Ss. 9d. per cwt. ! SALTPETRE.-The only sales reported are 200 bags, 10M per cent, refraction, at 34s.; and 260 bags, of GA per cent., at 35s. Gd., short prompts.
\V.EtrLY OMNIBUS STASTICS.-A long course of omnibuses from the extreme east to the west of London, extending from Stratford-le-Bow to Piccadilly-a distance little short of seven miles-bas lapsed into the service of the London General Omnibus Company, being 15 omnibuses the property of Messrs. Peck, Paul, BUis, North, Smith, Pound, E. Smitb, Gibbon, and Mlrs. Scheyer, with another one, belonging to Mr. Mann, from Plaistow to the Postoffice. With these it is probable that the purchases of the company will for the present cease, as the approach of fine weather is likely to make the proprietors stand out for high prices. The influence of the season, accompanied by the Easter holy days, has already made itself felt to the extent of one halfpenny per mile additional on the company's traffic receipts for the past week, a kim by no means so trivial as it appears, for by it the average return par omnibus is increased to 181. 12s., or at the rate per amnumi of 5O. additional profit on each of 384 omnibuses. The average mileage of the week izs llid., nearly at thersate of three pasSenD,ers at 4d. each for eveny mile-a number acknowledged ty omnibus proprietors to be satisfactorily remunerative. The total week's receipts are 7,1411. 14s., showing that the 384 omnibuses of the ' mpany (the average number runnng through the wreek) have carried no leas than 428,.502 passengers, at an average fare of 4d. each during the week. IVERPOOL, April 2.-The United States mail steamship Baltic sailed this morning for New York;, wit'h the utsul mails and 56 passengers.

Mr. Sargool opposed for a creditor named Lloyd, and -Mr. Mrscras supoorteds Formerly the insolvent had an income of about 36U. a- year from the Post-office, and was stationed in Glocestershire. When the mails were conveyed by railvays instead of coaches he was removed to London, and his salary was lS21. Since he had petitioned the Court he had been suspended, and he was now only an extra clerk a't 0Ld. per hour, earnhig about 35s. a-week. He had five children, some of whom were grown up. His debts were not large, and principally contracted in Glocestrshire. Mr. SARGOOD said the insolvent would no doubt be restored to his situation of 182. a-year when his case was over, as there was nothing to affect his character, and he suggested that 201. a-year should be set aside for the creditors enera]ly, or something done for the opposing creditor, fr. .Uoyd.

Mr, Parry appeared on the part of the assignees to conduct the prosecution; Mr. Humphreys attended on behalf of the prisoner. hlr. J. Wright, a clerk in Mr. Commissioner Goulburn's office, Court of Bankruptcy, produced the whole of the proceedings asainst the prisoner in bankruptey. Edward Pimm, grocer's assistant, of l,o. 6, Clifton-street, Finsbury, said-I was in the service of 'the prisonier, who formerly carried on the business of a grocer at lNo. 20, Bishopsgate-street-without, I was in his service tiU he was a bankrupt. A maeeting of sis creditors was caUed about a fortnight before he was a baunrupt. There was a second meeting of creditors, perhaps a week afterwards, and between the two 3neetings I assisted in removing some furnitur and six bags of coffee to the house of a friend of mine in Princes-street, Spitalfields. The value of the coffee was between 101. and 201., and that of the other articles between 51. and 101. Ireminember the messenger from the Court of Baukruptcy coming to take possession, and I recollect assisting an pulling a bag of pepper and other artcles through the trapdoor. I also assisted in puttng abox of raisinsinthe coal cellar,whereitwascovered over with coals. By the prisoner's dirctions I went round to some of the customers after the bankruptcy and received between 101. and 201. from them, which I handed to him. The prisoner gave me 71. for taking care of the furniture, putting away some spices, and covering the raisins. F. Long, aprivate in the 4th Dragoons, wlho was formerly assistant to theprisoner, corroborated the testimony of the last witness, and added, that the prisoner had promised him jl. when the affair was settled if he would not say anythinlg about it. The 'witness afterwards received 21. from the prisoner. W. T. StaUibrass, cellarman, of 25, Brunswick-street, Hackney-road, proved that he also assisted in removmg some of the stock in trade from the prisoner's house after himself i 2001., and-two sureties in luut. eacn. Misj-ane Field, a young lady of prepossessing appearance, and who is highly respectably connected, was brought before the LoRD ?tiyoR under the following distressing circumstances:- James DelU,a Thames police officer, having bean sworn, saad,-A bout 10 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 27th of .January, I was in a galley near London-bridge, when I bleard something fall, apparently from the parapet. I almost immediately heard a call for a beoat frJm the bridge. I went to the second abutment from the Surrey side, and saw the prisoner lying on the abutment, apparently lifeles;. I immediately procured assistance, and placed a rope round her body and lowe= her into my boat. I then took her to St. Thomas's Hospital, of which she has been an inmate till this morning. She had thrown hersef off the bridge, and was most seriously hurt. The prisoner, who appeared to be suffering very great mental as well as ecrly pain, and who supported herself by the aid of crutches, expressed much contrition for the offence she had committed,which she promised not to repeat. She was then given in charge of her friends, who seemed overwhelmed with grief. The cause of the rash act did not transpire. Patrick GiUllhan was charged, on his own confession,with being a deserter, eight years ago, from the 77th Regiment of Foot, then stationed at St. John's, Canada. The prisoner was remanded, in order that the authorities at the Horse Guards might be communicated with.

The charge arose from proceedings in the bankruptcy of a p on named Williai i ELsam. Mr. Nicholson was the ohicial assignee appointed, and two other gentlemen were appointed trade assignees. The messenger to the court, Mr. Hfamber, took possession, as was the custom, of the property of the bankrupt, and not being able to attend to it entirely himself he appointed the priSoner to take charge of the effects. He went doNvn tothe banrrapt's residence, Bugbrook, inNorthamptonshire, aud while there he was authorized to sell a portion of the property. The present charge against him was that, having received various sums for particular articles he signed the accounts, in which he stated that the amount he had re-. calved was less than that wbich he actually did receive. MIany fresh cases had recently come to light, and the asignees considered it their duty to institute the present ^ ~~~~k t-I 1-A ^ 1-4n. +-r ln-V if . th.^= jrisoner 6ild show that it was done with no ciminnal intention.

SPRING ASSIZES. NORTHERN: CIRCUIT. I.VERPOOL, APRL 1. CrONW',- COTURt-.Before Mr. Baron MtRTn.) James Carr and Philip Wall were indiCted for the wilful nurder of James House, at iUverpool, on the 20th of February last. Mr. Aspinall and Mr. Brett prosecuted; and Mr. Tindal Atkinson and Mr. 3PfDonnell defended the prisoners. Mr. ASPLNALT, in opening the case for the prosecution, :alledthe attention of the jury to the very serious nature of the charge against the prisoners at the bar. It wvas one V;hich would demand their utmost. consideration, both from the circumstantial character of the evidence, and the various statements which had been made by the prisoners. From the learned counsel's opening and from the ev,idence it ap. peared that the deceased James House was a sailor, and 'Was about to sail on a voyage on the 20th of February, anld on the previous night ho had left his lod2ins about 11 o'clock. and proceeded to a public- house, where he remained drinking until 12 o'clock, when he left in companyv. iti a girl narned Jane Hurst, intending to go home with her; but, in consequence of some suggestion made to him by a polceman " as to gett'ig home," he ulteredhis determination and left the girl at Chisenhall-street. After this another girl, residing in a brothel in the neighbour'hood, saw the deceasxed between 12 and 1 o'clock, lving on the pa.ement in a state of intoxication, and she observed a man endeavouring to lif binm up. Afterw ards the twso prisoners made their appearance and addressing the deceased in afamiliar manner, raised him up .and led him aw.ay be%wreen them into a court mn Clement-street, beyond wvhich is another desolate place called Buggin-entry. The party being observed by a poEceman, he went up and asked where they were going, upon which the prisoners stated that the deceased was a shipmato of theirs, and thlat they all lodged together;,and efter the officer had seen them all let intoa house awvonua who opened the door, he left them. Accordinisto ' the evidence of this woman, who kept abrothel, the partyreft her house in about ten minutes, and this was .about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning and the last time that the infortunate deceasedwas seenalive. Nothin- more wvas seen of bin- until a carter upon going to a stab0le adjoiniing Bui entrv about 406clockin the mornn- came upon the dead body of the manlying flat on his bacVz in the entry, nithout either coat, waistcoat, or boots; and upon sending for a oliocmnan they discovered a muffler tied very tiglit and kMotted round the threat of the deceased under the ear, and the face and hands quite livid, aynparently fromn strangulation, and on takin-- the body to tne Northern lho-pital the Surgeon gav.e it as his oninion that the deceased had been strangled. It seemed that about 5 on the same ioriing the two prisonersarrived at anotherbrothelin the neighbourhood, kept bv a person named Washinaton, each of them wearia" partoZ deceased's clothes. A third man came with thenm, but he left immediately afterwards. The prisoners rematined at this house with two girls for some time, and here it was that one of the girls noticed that Carr, whom shc knew, 'wore a muffler different to the one he usually w-ore, and she was induced to mention it because she knew that a girl to w-hom slhe had given a nmutter had told her that she had tiven it to Carr, and upoIn questionin- him as to what he had done with it, he said it was on a maa's neck, and he thought he must be dead by that time. In the course of an hour or two one of the girls went out, at the request of Canr, for some ale, and upon returninr she told the prisoners that a man had been foiuld murderea in Bugin-entry, npon which C.arr said, "I would take any man's life if he had plenty of money." Wall then took off a coat and Canr a vest (which were proved to be part of the clothes in which deceased had left ius lodgings on the previous night), and they requested one * of the girls to pawn them. Having left, she canic back, saying that the pawnbroker would not take them in unless they went themselves; upon which Carr said, "Don't be foolish, Wall, but go with her," which he did, and said they 'were his owvn, and pledged them in the name of Philip Wall. Ultimately the prisoners were taken into custodv, and upon Carr were found a pairof braces and comb, which ;ere proved - also to be the property of the deceased, and Wall was wear- ing a pair of shoes which wvere the same that the deceased left Ins lodgings in. The muffler worn by Carr was that of the deceased man, -while the one found aroumd the dead xman's neck was the one -which a girl named " Red Mary" had given to C.an. Thelearned counsel concluded by saying that he felt sure the jury would be anxious to 'give the prisoners the benefit of any donibt they might possibly entertain in this case; but, on the other band, he must remind them that, if the facts which -would Be detailed in evidence led to the conclusion that the deceased met with his death at the hands of the prisoners, it would then be their imperative duty to their country to find them guilty. In the course of the trial one of the jurymen fell down in a fit, and after some time, on its being reported to his Lordship that he was unfit to proceed in the discharge of the duht imposed upon him, his LoRsDSup discharged the jury, and a fresh juryman having been sworn, and the juryhaving been again charged, read over the evidence of each w^itness, the witnesses being resworn and attending, as far as the case had proceeded. The learned counsel for the defence then each addressed the jury on behalf of their respective clients, relying on the evidence being purely circiunstantial, and much of it depending on a class of witnesses whose habits of life enti ed them to little credit. The circumstances also proved, they contended, were consistent with the deceased haviug died from a fit of apoplexy, caused by intemperntce and exposure to the cold; and, althouglh it was not attempted to be denied that the prisoners had robbed him wvhile in his helpless state of drmlkenness, yet it was denied that any murder had been committed; that the prisoners could have no motive for murderinz tile helDless man. and that the '_ -r"Z\l - J.r T, VT - >avLVluvce. Eis LoRD-snir having carefully summed up the cvi dence, The jury retired, and after a short absence& returne& into court about 7 o'clock with a verdict of thdltfl againsi both the prisoners, accompanying it with a recomuIendatior to mercy. His LORDSHIP having put on the black cap proceeded t the sentence of death. He said,-Philip Wall anc S=Ses Carr, the jury, after a most patient investigation o1 this case, and after hearing everything that could be urged on your behalf, have found you guilty of murder. They have accompanied that verdict by a recommendation tc mercy. With that I have nothing to do beyond fturtherinm it for the consideration of the advisers of the Qiieen, who will act upon it as she thinks fit. So far as I am concerned, I have but one duty to perform, and that is to sentence you to die. I do not inquiire what are the reasons which have induced the jury to give this recommendation, but I presume it is in consequence of the state of drink which, probably, you were all in, or maybesupposedto have been in; but, ho weverthat mavbe, that is their recommendation, and I will further it to the proper quarter. At the same time I must say my own judgment goes along with the verdict they have found,; and 1 do not see hov they could have arrived at any other conclusion but thatthat unfortunate man House came to his death by your hands upon that night. The circumstances are such that I have no doubt in my mind that their verdict is the correct one, and that there is no way in which his death could be accounted for except that you-both of you, probably-made use of themuffler which Carr had, that you choked hin witli that, and carried away that wvhich he had aboti. his throat in lieu of the one you so used. Your object, probably, was to rob lihim of the little he had. No doubt your conduct in staying about thle place where the murder occurred was so strange that it may have iniduced the jury to think that you are not so respolacsble for your conduct as persoms zene- ....j ae. >, Luvever tMat may be, I have but one duty to perform, and I do entreat you both not to trust or put any confidence in this recommendation to mercy. I will not at all stand in the way of it; but I by no means feel certain that the advisers of the Crown will counsel the Queen to mitigate your sentence. I beseech you, therefore, to take the opportunity which will be given you, and make your peace with God, for it may be that you will be very shortly caled before Him. All I have to do is to pass npon yen the sentence of the law, and that is, that you, ?hfiIh Wall, and you, James Carr, for the crime of murder of w ch you are now convicted, be taken from hence to the prison whence you came, that you be taken thence to the p lace of execution and there hanged by the neck till you are dead, and that your bodies, when dead, be taken down and buried within the precincts of the prison ; and may God have mercy upon your souLs. hs Lordship appeared much affected in passing sentence. While the prisoners were being removed, the prisoner Uarr said, in the hearina of several persons standing near the dock-, " I hope it c-i11 be the last the -ever vwill sentence." WFEDNsDAY, APRIL 2.

In 1847 the defendant, who was an old Draetitioner at Wellined ton, entered into a' partne p for life with ute plaintiff, who was a young man who had just cominenced practice. In 1852 differences occurred between them, and tWo cross actions were brought, which were referred to Mr. Howell, of Wandsworthl, by whose award the deed noon whlich the present action was brought was executed betee the prtes. By the deed it was covenanted ihat they were eac h to keep seprate books containig entries of the practice and oneys received by each; tha't the defendant should recive 3501. a-year out of the proceeds of the business for three years and that be should use his best to promote the interests and preserve the practice of the rmi duringthe time, and should introduce the plaiitiff to all his exclusive patients; and, after the expiration of the three years the defendant should not act except in consultation with other medical men ahid that he should not assist or introduce any other inedicai man. The penalty on the first breach was 5001., and, as to his practising, 2,0001. It was proved that the defendant had scarcely ever come to the Dispensary, and that he kept no cashbook; thab he had not introduced the paintiff to any of his exclusive patients; that he had evaded the clause of not practising, except in consultation, by acquainting the patients that he w.as forbidden under the deed to practise, but that he would attend them by bringing any other medical man with hime; that he had also stated that he must decline to meet the plaintiff, hut named fear medical men with wvhom, or .any others, he would attend. This last point was chiefly relied upon as having produced great injury to the For the defence, the defendant was called, and mainly contradicted all that was alleged on the part of the plaintiff. After a trial lasting a day and a-half, The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 1,2001. The verdict was entered for 2,500l. as liquidated damanges under the deed, with leave to move.
OXFORD CIRCUIT. GLOCESTER, ArRIL 2. CInL COURT.-(Before AIr. Justice URESS_wELLe ana special Juries.) DEGG V. THE IIDLMASD RIIULWAY COMEPANY. Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Skinner appefared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Keating, Q.C., and 31r. Phipson for the defendants. The trial of this ca-use was concluded after the despatch of our yesterday's report. The plaintiff, Carohine Degg, was the administratrix of her deceased husband, and she brought the present action against the Midland Railway Company to recover damages for the death of her deceasedhusbanld, who was kllei by the alleged negligence of the defendants' servants. The defendants pleaded only the general issue. Mr. Serjeant PIGO1T, in opening the case, stated that, on the 20th of October last, the deceased was in the service of the Messrs. Pickford and Co., the carriers, at Cheltenhan. He -was engaged on the day in question in the goods shed assisting a man named Webb in unloading a truck on a siding. While so employed he saw the servants of the company engaged in endeavonring to turn a truck on a turntable close by, at the end of the siding. The men engaged in this operation did not appear to be equal to the duty, and this led the deceased to join them and lend his assistance, which he did with his head against the buffer. On the siding where the turntable was there were some loaded trucks, then a space, and afterthat a considerable number of empty trucks. lt appeared that, while the deceased was lending his assistance, a man named Lloyd, in charge of an engine, came on the siding to take alvay the empty trucks, and in so doing he drove against the empty tracks, then backed on to the loaded trucks, and, finally, knocked the truck offthe turntable, atthe same time janmunin the head of the deceased between the buffer and a wall. Trhe deceased remained fixed in that distressing position for several minutes, and when he was at length liberated the blood was flowving from his nose, ears, and mouth. He was at once taken to the infirmary, and died the same night. The learned Serjeant said he should call witnesses to prove that the accideist was owing to Lloyd's negligence, whose duty it -was to move his engine only in obedience to orders, whiclh in this instance were not given. In support of the plaintiff's case several witnesses were examined, including the plaintiffherself. She appeared to be a very interesting young woman, and stated that her husband vwas a book clerk, at a salary of S5W. a-year, with a house and firing, and that by his death she was left with four youn- children. The servants of the company who vere called stated that they did not hear the whiatle which was the usual signal that an engine wvas coming. On the close of the plaintiff's case Mr: KE.ATING submitted there was no case. Mr. Justice CRESSWELL said, he had some doubt as to whether the action could be maintained, but he wvould not decde the point now. He wvould give the defendants leave to move if necessary. Mr. KEA1STI then addressed the jury for the defendants, and contended that, however much the unfortunate accident was to be deplored, the company were not liable. The deceased was a mere volunteer, and did not interfere with the triuck inthe discharge of any duty. That question would be decided hereafter, but the learned counsel said he felt it to be his duty to call vwitnesses to rebut the charge of negligence wlhich had been made. It would be shown that betore the engine moved into the siding the usual signal was male by a main holding up the hand, and that when the en&ineman came he gave the usual signal by the wlhistle. Several witnesses were then examined in support of this defence. Mr. Justice CaEsSwvrLL having summed up the evidence, The jury foiud a verdict for the plaintiff, wvith 3001 damages; but, it being then discovered that in her declaration the plaintiff only claimed 2007., the damages 'were entered for the latter sum. The amount was apportioned thus:100?. for the widow, and 251. for each of her four children. The defendants had leave reserved to move the Court. CIILD V. PIITi'PS AND OTHERS. M1r. Keating, Q.C., and Mtr. Skinner appeared for tbe plaintiff; Mr. W. H. Cooke and Mr. Powell for the defendant. This was an action in which ihe plaintiff sought to recover dama es from the defendants for a false representation as to the value of 50 acres of coal in a mine situated in the Forest of Dean, in this county, about four miles from the town of Nuneham. The defendants, Messrs. Phipps and Green were the lessees of the mine, and they induced the plaintiff to advance the stum of 300?. towards worLing it more effectualy by the representation that the coal was of "first-rate quality." It appeared that the coal was of two kinds, lying in two seams. Thetop coal was of abolut 10 inches and of good quality, but the other caled " Smart Delf Coal" was of inferior quality. In the result, there was a considerable loss, owing to the inferior quality of the coal, and the expense necessarily air. 106CR submitted that there was no evidence to show that the defendants knew the representation to be false. Mrr. KEAMNG relied upon the fact that the defendants were working colliers, and acquainted with the working of mmies. Plr. Justice CRESSwVELL could not say there was no eNidence, but his Lordship thoughtthe jury would scarcely find a verdict for the plaintiff, seeing the defendants had expended their own money in sinking tIhe new shaft, and that the expense had been increased by the inlflux of wvater. Besides, the plaintiff allowed three years to elapse before any complaint was made of a false representation. Mr. K EaIriss said that upon that intimation he would elect to be nonsuited Mr. Justice CRESS WELL said that if the jury were to find a verdict for the plaintiff, it would be niuch against his opinion. The plaintiff was then nonsuited. CRBD5IL Co)URT.-(Befose Ms. Baron BRAssNWELL.) Giles Ball, the elder, 48; Giles Ball, the younger, 17 George Ball, 21, Henry Ball, 24, and Thomas atgood, 22, were charged with entering certain land called Halgatepiece, at Little Sodbury, the property of Mr. W. H. Hartley, armed with bludgeons, for the purpose destroying game, on the night of the 19th of January, 1856. Mr. W,. H. Coke and Mr. Somerset appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Powell appeared for Hatgood; the other prisoners were undefended. It appeared that at about 11 o'clock on the night of the 19th of January Mr. Evans, gamekeeper to the Duke of Beaufort, hearing two shots in the direction of Lyegrove, went to the house of Joshua Holloway, Mr. Hartley's gamekeeper, and finding him at honie they both wvent together in search of poachers. In a few minutes a lurcher dog came up to them, and, following him, they met five man armed with bludgeons. Four of them were known to Evans, and were now identified byhim as the prisoners Bal. Evans said to them, "lWhere are you goingi'e They said, " To Badninton." Evans said, " You had better go back. or it will be worse for you." They went on together, and Giles Ball, sen., said, "Go into them." The five nien immediately attacked the keepers. Evans was knocked down several times and severely injured in the head by the bludgeons, but eventualy he got away. Returning in a few minutes, he found Holoway insensible, Evans supported Holloway to Mr. Hartle3's lodge, and then went to Sodbury to the police. A polce-constable named Davis, in company with Evans and some other men, went to the house of Giles Ball, the elder, and being refused admittance he forced the door. He found inside GilesBall, the elder, Giles Ball, the younger, andGeorge Ball, a quantity of game-nets, and five hares lately kiled. There was aLso a dog close to the door, which was identified by Evans and afterwards by Holloway as the dog which had been with the men on the previous evening. They then proceeded to Hemy Ball's house and found him and Hatgood in bed, and also found there some nets and a bludgeon. Henry Ball was identified by Evans, but Hatgood was not. Holloway suffered a considerable time from the injuries received, and Evans also had been severely inj ured in the head. The jury found al the prisoners guilty, with the excep. tion of Hfatgood, against whom no evidence wr.as offered. Sentence deferred.
AUTO3MATA FRoM PALacs.-At the Egyptian-hall, in the room adjoining the renowned Swiss retreat of Mr. Albert Smith, there is now an exhibition well worth the attention of all persons who feed their intellect with "sights." On first entering the room the spectator, -who finds himself in the presence of several motionless animals, over which a fiddling monkey and a smart doll with a guitar seem to hold a sort of chieftainship, may be inclined to believe that he has strayed into an expensive toyshop, furnished with a limited stock. However, no sooner are certain springs touched by the lady *who presides over the exhibition than these various objects are endowed with mimic life. The monkey moves his bow and also the separate fingers of his left hand, while his jaws clap together in token of his satisfaction; a hare begins to browse at a cabbage with the most luxurious munching; a goat utters an audible cry, .and a child that has been reposng quietly in its cradle wakes up uneasily and screams aloud for its " Pa" and its " Ma." Tthehua figures cannot be deprived of their doll-like appearance, for the play of countenance is too subtle to be accurately imitated by clockwork, and therefore the features are allowed to remain rigid; but the representation of brute life is perfect, the great peculiarity being that the most delicate movements, such as the twinkle of the eyes and the twitch of the tail are reproduced -with the highest degree of truthfulness. Moreover, the real skin of the animal is employed as an envelope to the machinery, and the original form is so completely imitated that it is almost a difficulty to believe thattthe figures are not alive, till the superintend inS lady opens a trap in the back of each and shows the artificial wheelwork that has been substituted for the motive principle of nature. The visitors to the Parisian Exhibition ast year need not be informed that some of these automata were among the more conspicuous objects then presented to the world's gaze.

I THE BISHOP OFBANGOR AND MB. STAI)LEY. TO THE EDITOR OE THE TIMES. The Bishop of Bangor has this morning seen a letter in The Times in which the writer assumes the truth of a statement made by Mr. Stanley in a letter tome, that I had signified my intention to him and the clergy of the diocess that I intend to prosecute in the Court of Arches any clergymen signing the petition for contempt and insubordination. Before the Bishop takes any further notice of this statement he will state what the contents of the circular reaUy were which he sent to all the beneficed clergy and several of the most respectable laymen of the diocess, but which does not appear in the printed copies of their correspondence which MTr. Stanley inserted in the North Wales C7vonide. The contents of this circular were the section of the Plurality and Residence Act by which those services and the Bishop's power are regulated and linited, and a short comment on it, in which he stated that those clergy who bad signed the so-called petition had been guilty of an act laity who had signed it bad comnitted an offence against the law of the land, by endeavouring to control and coerce the Bishop in the exercise of the discretion which that law had assigned to him. I have said to Mr. Stanley, in a letter of a very late date -viz., April I: " This is a direct and palpable falsehood, and a construction which no man whose reasoning powers and common sense were not clouded and distempered could have put on my words. Nothing can be plainer than that mv objects in sending out the circular were-first, to acquaint both clergy and laity with the law by which these services and tha Bishop's power were regulated and limited ; and, secondly, to caution those who had signed this so-called petition agailst a repetition of such sily and absurd conduct. But he had no more intention of prosecuting the clergy who had signed it in the Court of Arches than of bringing an action for misdemeanour against every layman who had signedl it." In justice, however, to Mr. Stanley, I must quote another passage of the letter sent to hbn yesterday:- " I am ready to give you credit for having worked yourself up into a persuasion that you have spoken the truth and put the only possible construction on my words. " Laying it down as an incontrovertible principle that you must be in the right, and every one whio differs from You in the wrong, you brood over your own chimerical fancies till yoU mistake them for truths and realities." Of this the Bishop mentions some signal instances, which will be found in the appendix, page 15, of the little book which he sends to the Editor of Tle Times. As the Bishop went to London just before this book was printed, he had no opportunity of correcting the proof sheet, -nor did Mr. Stanley correct the e1r;-ata of the Vorth IFales Chronicle, so that it is full of blunders and crrata. As to the attack made on the Bishop about a week sine, in 27we Timnes at hap-hazard, in perfect ignorance of the facts of the case, be does not thinlk it worthy of notice. He will onlzy venture to think that, thouh the old gentleman sneered at in that leading article, ho l'as not been laid prostrate by its hero, Mr. Stanley 2 Maurigy's Hotel, 1, Regent-street, April 2.

AbUlaTERATIO4Y OF FOOD. I The CoGmi;ttee met sesterdav in Room 2No. 17. 3fr. SCHOLFyIED M tlle cfaRr. 3Ir. T. Wakley, coroner for iddlesex, and proprietor of the Lan,cit, said, from the investigations which he had made he was quite satisfied that adulteration was carried onto an enormous extent in mo$ articles of food. He believed that legislation on the subject was absolutely necessary, or the investigations which had been made and the publicity given to the various tricks of the trade would ogly have the effect of increasinr the evil by showing dishones persons bow to deceive, Thiwas proved by the fact that adultera- | tions had increased after the publication of Mr. Ackerman's I work, entitled Death in the Pot, He was convinced that tradesmen generally were most anxious to carry on an honest business and would submit to any amount of inconvenience in order to put an end to the present frauds. He (ar. Wakley) had given much thought and attention to plans for checking adulteration, and his only hope was that some means would be adopted for giving pubhcity to the names of parties whose goods were examined. In the exccise department an enormous amount of good would have been done had publicity been given to the proceedings. ln preventi.ngadulteration,wvhat was required v;as some hght machinery that could be actively employed and moved aboat in every direction, and it would not be necessary to go to any great expense to accompish this object- the labour might be easily grafted on the General Board of Health, which had not a great deal to do. Purchases of the various articles should be made by persons in whose character the board could confide, and a penalty should in all cases follow where there was an adulteration detected, but the great reliance would be the publication of the names and addresses of all traders whose goods had been examined. The honest trader would thus have the benefit of the statement that he b"ad resisted the temptations to adulterate. The names should be posted in public situations-on church or chapel doors, at the entrance to vestry meetings, at police-stations, town-halls, or wherever they were likely to be seen. This publicity alone he (Mr. Wal-dey) believed would give a check to the system, even without any other remedy. The officers should have power to enter any premises suspected to contain adulterated goods, for without this power the law would be frustrated, and he did not believe there would be any objection raised to such powvers being given. He looked upon this as a question not of revenue, but as afftecting public morals, and few dishonest traders would like to be exposed to the operations of a law which held them up to public disgrace. During the inquiries made by the lancet Commission about S2 reports were made, and the average number of purchases for each report was from 20 to ~30; and he believed he made more enemies by the publication of the names of thc various parties than he had e.ver done before. Some tradesmen said they did not regret it, as they hoped it would lead to stopping adulteration altogether. The reports and investigatious must have been made with the utmost care and greatest ability on the part of Dr. Hassall and the gentlemen he consulted, or the consequences would have been most ruinous; as it was, only one action wvas brought, which was compromised, both parties paying their own costs. By '.W ISE.-He was aware that there was a law in the metropolis whiclh ordered that all bread not made of pure flour should have a large Al mariked on it; but he had never seen it done, and he believed it was from wvant of a public prosecutor, as it was utterly impossible for the xajority of people to detect adulteration. By Mr. Mornatm.-He had not calculated the number of officers that would be required to carry out his plan; but he believed he could put dowin adulteration entirely in London and the suburbs at the expense of 10,0001. He thought three or four examiners and six purchasers would be quite sufficienit for the whole metropolis. After entering into an explanation of wvhat he considered an adulteration, Mr. Wakley said, in answer to several questions, he coiisidered the addition of alum to bread a most injurious adulteration, and that many of the infantine diseases were referrible to the use of such nWlui -esome food. Mr. Jacob Bell, late member of St. Albans, said he was engaged in the wvliolesale drug trade, and agreed generally vi'th the evidence already liven as to the adulteration of drugs, although he thoughti m scne points there had been |someexaggeration. In 1841 he Lad p resented a paper to the Pharmaceutical Society oii the subject, which related chiefly to the adn' oration practised on the drugs before ianportation. Shic- th.at period a cons;der.able improvement had takeii *] ace. MIr. Bell then enumerated several drugs which w.re fornmerly very much adulterated, but which could now be obtained in a pure state. Anong these were millk of sulphur, scaunnony, &c. Opium could be obtained pure if required; it i-as cbiefly a quiestion of price, He believed some adulterations were practised among the drug grinders, hut not now to the extent which had been supposed. Hte (-. Bell) wishei to remark;that th:e povders called "gentian compouitis" wvere chiefly used for horse and cattle medicines, .and this might account for their being cnmAn,pqn.nrAprc.A IiL reply to questions from Mr. OrwAyt, w itness said, anv person could set up as a chyniist bithout hahing received any education. He might be a shoemaker to-day and a chymist to-morrow. The only restriction wvas that he was not allow ed to Cal himself a member of the Pharmaceutical Society without being registered, but be might call himself a chymist. It was found useless to take steps for putting a stop to the frauds practised as long as any person, howvever ignorant, was allowved to deal in them. A great number of chyanists were properly qualified, but it was in consequence of their own act, and not because the law compelled themn. Some were, no doubt, ignorant men, and he had latelv been applied to by a schoohnaster to fit up a chymist's shop for him, not because ,he knew anything of chyniistry, but becauseethere wasanopeningforthebusiness. Withregard to anyprotection tothepublic in the sale of poisons,he thought the best safeguard would be to label every article sold. ' Cocculus Indicus" was largely importedinto this country, and he did not know of any other purpose to which it was applied except the adnIltpxtkQR laws in^forcein America for the preven'tion of the adulteration of drugs, and said he believed something of the same natuLre introduced into England would be of advantage, more especially that rule whicll enforced the examination of all drugs in bond. The subject of the sale of quack medicines was one which required serious consideration, and which was at preselit encouraged by the Legislature for the sake of the tax levied on them. These medicines did a great anount of mischief, as they vwere given indiscriminately for all disorders. Mr. Bell concluded by saying he did not think that any harm would be done by t.he present iiqniry', -whether any law were passed on the subject or not, althouigh some legislation was most desirable. There had been some attempt to frighten the public unnecessarily, but the co-operation of the Legislature was requisite in order to protect the public, and to enable the honest men to combine together and punish the rogues. Dr. Carpenter, examiner of physiology at the University of London, had.considered the practice of adulteration as a matter of sanitary legislation. The conclusion he had arrived at was that a large amotint of adultcration existed. The addition of alum to bread -was peculiarly injllrious, as he might mention that he himself had found the alum in a crystallized state in bread suppled by a most respectable baker. The chief injury alising from the use of alum was in its astringent property. He was aware that inder an act of Parliament alum was strictly prohibited, and could only accounit for the act not being enforced by attributinig it to the unwillingness of the public to become prosecutors. The system of Government i ectors was the only remedv. Ile had heard the evidence of Mr. Walzley, but did not think it would be possible to obtain the services of gentlemen properly qualified except at a much larger expense than he contemplated. He (Dr. Carpenter) thought, there should be a central board in London, and samples sh uld be purchased and sent up for examination. With regard to the examinations made by Dr. Hlassall, he thought it was impossible for the number of his analyses to have been made with sufficient accuracy. The number published in a week would have occupied more than half-a-dozen gentlemen. The cominittce then adjoured until Friday at half-past 12.
THE TARTARS OF THE CRIMEA. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-I have just returned to England after having had five months' experience of Russian prisons. To dwell on my hardships and the degradation of my feelings on a march of 133 days with convicts into the interior of that country Is not the object of this letter. My desire is to fL- instant attention on the pitiable condition of hunIreds of the wretched Tartar population of the Crimea who are festering in Muscovite prisons, or on march to exile, guilty of no other crime than that of having supplied provisions to the allied troops. I At Simpheropol I saw them lying in the loathsome cells of the town; on the roads I saw them dragged from their homes, chained, beaten, wending their way, as I was informed, to the horrors of Siberian exile. They looked for pity, not umningled with hope, to the friendly tones of their Englishlfellow-captives. Let not the sorrovful sighing oftheseprisonersand their trust inEnglish sympathybe vain. Let these lines, supported by England's powerful ap. peal, claim regard to their sufferings, and challenge remedy for their wrongs. The peace thathas been signed will diffuse joy throughout Russia. Let the magnanimity of their Emperor, who has restored thisblessing to his vast domains, give back the Crimean exiles to their hearths. No subjects in All the Russias have suffered more than the wretched inhabitants of that Crimea which war has made desolate. Then, letEnglandand her allies plead that to these unhappy Tartars this last drop in the cup of their gall and bitterness may be spared which bereaves them of their fathers. their brothers, and their SonS. An act of grace to these condemned men would be a monument more enduring than that of brass to the generosity of him who should extend to them his imperial favour, and restore them to the homes which may still be left, where, around the family altar, they might implore a blessing on his head.

The tithe commuta- on is nearly completed; every parish (with few exceptions) has its map .md book of reference in which are set forth the acreage and cultivation of every field; also the acreage of all Igardens, buildings, roads, rivers, wiaste, &;c.- Duolicate maps and references of each parish are deposited in Somerset- How very simple it would be to appoint a proper valuer in each union to make these returns. The Tithe Commissioners, or, if you will, "The Board of Agricultue," could send to him a printed reference of eaci parish, to be filled in by the 1st of September in each year.

The Secretary, Mr. MDonald, read the report, which recommended, a dividend of 11. 7s. 6d. per share, being at the rate of 5A per cent. per annum, free of income-twc, on each original sare ofthe stock, and so on in proportion on other paid-up stock. The CiRLRmxL congratulated the meeting on the pros- I perous state of the company, and moved that the report be adopted. B.. STOCRS, in seconding the motion, also congratulated the shareholders on the state of their affairs.

Ageneral meeting ofthis companytookplace on Monday, at Paris, lf. de L'Espee, the president, in the chair. The meeting having been declared duly constituted, ML dle L'Espe, junn, proceeded to read the report:- The document commences by recapitulating the circum. stances which led, last year, to the amalgamation of all the linesvwhich now constitute tbe above railway, and states that while, on the one hand, the State had imposed on the company the construction of 910 kilometres (670 Engish miles) of new lines, it, on the other, accords, in conjunction with the localities through which the new lines are to pass, subventions amounting to 58,901,646f. (2,356,065!,), the State also purchasing the land and constructig the earthworks and works of art on the old Western line as far as Rennes. In addition, the concession was extended to the year 1957, and the State renounced its right to share profits over 8 per cent. The works now in course of execution would be constructed for a sum Iess than the original estimate. The section from la Loupe to Le Xans, now entirely finished, had cost 10,467,54bf (418,7011., while the estimate had been 10,500,000f. (420,000.), the cost per kilometre being 146,300f. (5,8521.), including the working stock. The cost for similar items on the line from Chartres to la Loupe had been 145,30Wf. (5,8121.) The reportexplains the exchange of sharesof the various companies forming the amalgamation, and shows that, out of the 306,000 shares of all the old companies, only 3,909 remained unexchanged; and of that number 2,320 belonged to the old Cherbourg Company, owing to the circumstance of the shareholders being still liable to pay up a ca3L By the terms of the amalgamation 3,447 new shares had remained over unappropriated, and were sold at the Bourse for the benefit of the company. That operation had produced a profit of 947,918f. (37,9161). The board had also effected the conversion of all the old bonds of 17 different kinds into a single category, extending over a greater lenLth of time, whereby an annual saving was effected of 225,GSf. (9,0221.). The amalgamated company had some3 months back signified to the Government that it waL5 ready to undertake the execution of the line imperatively called for to serve the neutral space between the Orleans and Old Westerm, namelv, 'that from Chartres to Tours. The board had been lately called before the Council-Genp-Al of the Pons-et-Chaussees to give explanations on the l- hicc. and they thou-ht that the C-overnnient would accede to the proposition iley had made. in like manner theTe was reasonto be]ieve that the amaleamated company would be permitted to establish a junotion lne between theRouen Rlilwayandthat from Paris to Aniiens. The newline, if conceded, will run fromthe main line past Gournay to Beauvais, and thence to CreiL The traffic had so steadily improved that it was found necessary to order 35 new locomotives and 185 first-class carriages. The traffic receiPts for the year 1855 amounted tc 33,S56,862f. (1,354,2741.), and the expenses to 13,857,458f. 554,2981.), leaving a profit of 19,999,403f. (799,976!& Fronm this sum is deducted the interest on loans 4,891,7b4f., the interest on the paid-up share capital at 3. per cent. to the shareholders, 5,,50,000f. (210,0001.), leaving 9,S57,620f., oi 32f. 50c. per share for dividend; which lYith the 17f. 50c. already paid asinterest at3per cent,,gave atotal of 5OL per share, or 10 per cent, onthe original share capitaL The vidend approved would be paid at the office of the company on aud after the 1st of Ap)ril. (Cheers.) This report was unnimously adopted, together with the accounts Winch accompaea a Lt. A sum of 215,000f. (S,00.I) was voted as the annual remuneration to the Board of Directors, for their services; and, after the passing of a resolution, authorzing the board to establsh a fund to pension off aged servants of the company, the proceedings terminated.

(erected within the last three years at an expenditure of nearlyt.10,C00,) and the Goodwill of ilis important imdertaking. It may be necessary in explanation to state that the Company was formed for the manufacture of stearic and composite candles, that an article has been prodiiced of unrivaled quality, and a valuable and extensive crn-.ecion formed throughout the kingdom and the colonies, creating a demand that the Company wvere unable to meet from an inadleqjuate capital, which alone has compelled its dissolution, and the necessity for the present sale: thums offering to capittlists an opportunity of entering upon an established undertaking that mass yield the most liberal profits. Thewvhole of the plantand works are in complete working condition: they hlave been constniated upon the mosA approved rneiples, embodying all modem scientific improvements, regu- ay practical knowledgo of the object in view. wh ch is evident in the masterly arrangement of the whole of the works. The heating processes throughout the manifacnture. and the chief part of the mechanical operations. are performed by steam. The present plant is equal to the working of about 60 tons of candies per week; but the premises would admit of a considerablc extension of tbe manufaclure by a email addition to the plant, which will doubtless be caled for by the incrensed demndd that will arise from the reduced price of the saw material.
