THE WEST ILYTDIA AND PA CIEiOC MILS (BY ELECTRICT EEGiRA SOUTIAMIPTONI, FPJDAYl sG r - B3y the Royal Mail Company's-Steimship Magdalena, Captain Abbott, with the West lndia'aiid Pacific mails, we have dates fromJamaica toJanuary '27, Dernerara and Trinidad- 26, Barbadoes'28, St. 1ucia 29, St. Thomas's 31. The Magdalena brings 7 passeng,ers, among whom are Sir W. Colebrook, late Governor, and Genelal Wood,- late Comnissioner-in-Chief of the Windwaxd Islands. On freight there is specie, value $2,9OO,249; S21,794 consigned -to Colonel Facio, supposed to be on account of Mexican dividends; b55,000 value in iewehy, &c., ancd the usual cargp. During the homeward voyage the, Magdalena ex-perienced strong gales from N.W. and S.W. I From Jamaica ve learnthat matters remaim much the same. The House of Assembly was.stiil in se6sion. A ver-y unpopular measure haa passedthe. House for the purpose of raising, it was estimated, 6,OOOl.1 to educate the labouiing population, it being contended that there were sufficient scholars alreadyin existence, and that it was a difficult mattr to induce tpeople to send their children regularly. ThisX tax, it was presumed, wsould fall heavily on' the middle class. The Executive Cijinmittee had become unpopular on 'account of this measure. They -were obliged7to abandon several measures, and' found it difficult to carry any tirough the House. Fever was very prevalent, and the mortality -great.; Rumours had reached Jamaica that there -was great excitement at Hayti, and that -the Emperor Soulouque had fled. Commercial matters remained the-same. *Brend-was in extensive supply, wiffh no demand. The corn-market was bare, but supplies were ar?riving. Exchange for bills on London, foi 60.dats, was quoted at 1. per cent. prepium. At Deemerara an important public 3neeting had been held to take into consideration' the subJe-t of nunigration. The weather was very dry, and'sever,l deaths had occurred from yellow fever. *The Court of Policy was again in session. His ExceIlency announced to the Court that Her iajesty's Go-' vernment had agreed to continue to guarantee the passage money of emigrants from .the East Indies to British Gtiana. Fires had taken. place on plantations, at Peter's-hall, on the 14th nlit., and at leonora, which had done much damagce. , From Grenada we learn that plantation work was proceeding with considerable spirit. The New House of Assembly was shorily to be vallkdtogether, and the elections were about to commence. There had been several arrivals from America, and the markets were well stocked with provisions. - At Trinidad considerable excitement existed in consequence of the discovery of several successful forgeries which had been perpetrated upon the Branch Colonial Bank to the extent ,of several thousand pounds. Planters were looking forward to a heavy crop this season. The weather -was favourable to their expectations.-- There is nothing of interest fromn the other West Indian islands.
VISIT OF THB SULTAN TO THE FRENCaH EM-BASSY. We take the following lettei fromtheMintiteur -:- "PERA, F13 5. "On the same day upon -which lEs Majesty the Sultan paid a visit to the English embassy, he notified his inten tion to M. de Thouvenel to attend a ball which was to be given three days afterwards at the lrench embassy. Every preparationvwasimmediately made by the representative of the Emperor to receive His Majesty with the honours due to his sovereign rank At 7 o'clock in the evening the whole front of the embassy was splendidly iluminated. Above the principal gateway a brilliant transprency showed in lines of fire the Imperial 'toughra.' Detachments of picked companies from the French regiments encamped at 'al-, sappes of the engineers, a division of the firebrigade (&apcurg. Iornpicrs) of Paris, and foot artillery occupied the avenues of the embassy and formed the line. Opposite the French troops, whoso martial bearing created admiration, wa3 drawxrup a battalion of the Imperial Ottoman Guard in ful uniform. At half-past 7 o'clock one of Hs Majestys aidesde-camp came and informed the ambassador that the Suitan had left Tophane; anid was proceeding on horseback through Pera-street. ML Thouvene3, accompanied by all the members of the embassy, and by the generals and superior officers of the French division, went as far as the gates of the palace to receive His Majesty. As soon asi -the Sultan made his appearance the drmais beat to arms, the troops presented arms, and the mfihtay band strnck up the Turkish national hymn. Bengal lights were lit as if by enchantment, and their brilliant light enabled the Sultan tohave a good view of the coup d'<il offered by the court of honour of the palace. His Majesty, accompanied by the ambassador,proceededby one of the grandstaircases specially reservedfor him tothe apartmentsprepared for his reception. A company of Zouaves, a detachment of Cuirassiers, Drngroons, and Chasseurs d'Afrique formed the line inside the palace conjointly with the Naval Brigade and Ottoman Atillerymen. After a fewv momenta' repose, which the Sultan took advantage of to have some private conversation with the ambassador, His lfajesty, wearing the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour, and a uniform richly studded with jewels, preceded by the officers of his Household, entered the Throne-room. He found drawn up in two lines-to the right his 3Mnisters and the great dignitaries of State, to the left the foreign ambassadors and the French and English generals residing at Constantinople.1 To the right of the throne reserved seats were occupied by the ladies of the diplomatic corps. Mis Majesty was led towards the throne by the ambassador. His attention was immediately attracted by a portrait of the Emperor. Having looked at it for a few moments-'Iam happy,' he said to M. Thouvenel, 'to behold the features of my august and faithful ally. I experience the most lively satisfaction at being his guest today.' "His Majesty immediately received the homage of the diplomatic corps. He conversed with all the foreign represetatives, especially with those of England, Austria, and Prussia. He had a gracious word for every lady presented to him. After the official introductious the ambassador took His Majesty's orders, who expressed the wish to visit the ballroom where the 6aita of Pera was assembled-all the members of the different embassies and a great number of naval and military officers in full uniform. "T The Sultan was announced by the introdncer of ambassadors. A line wasfonned up to tne seat prepared for His Majesty, who entered preceded by the officers of the. Crown, and followed by the diplomatic corps. He was received with expressions of marked respect and the most hlvely sympathy. His Majesty would not sit down till the ladies and the ambassadors accredited to his Govermment had taiken their places. "Hiaving taken His Majesty's orders, the Amabassador gave the signal for opening the bal; a quadrile was immediatelygformed in front of him, and the dancing commenred. "In about an hour His Iajesty retumned to the Throne-room, where he requested the presence of the ladies who had been presented to him. They sat down, forming a circle round the - Sultan. 3;ady George Paget, the Princess Stourdr.s, and Madame laBaroanoe Darrican were iatrod3uced tohim. His Majesty rose to bow to (sefuci') each of these ladies. After half an hour's conversation the Sultan returned to the ballroom, which he left at half-past:1o o'clock, to retire to his private apartments, where he took leave of the ambassador, and thank-ed him graciously for the reception hehad met with. His Majesty was conducted back with the same ceremony to the gates of the palace, where he mounted his horse and rode in front of the troops, who presented arms as he passed.

Sir,-The manner in whiTh Sir Johm Shelley, in his speech on the Irish Judicial Bench last night, mixed up the question I pat to the Secretary for Ireland in MWay las3t with an incorrect report of thne statement Irmade in ex;planation of that question would justly expose mne to a I chargxe of gross inaccuracy. I am made to affirm that no less than " six Irish judges were permanently incapacitated by ilness." flat I did state was, in substa3ice, that three judges were more or less incapacitated by old age and its attendant infimities, that a fourth had been for six months absent in Spain in consequence of illness, and that a fifth was withdrawvn from his ordinary duties by the business of the E3ncumabered Estates Court, while frequently two, and recently three assistant barrmstess had filled the places of absent judges on circuit. I am. Sir, your obedient servant.- EL JL BRUCE..

Soon terljgotonboar I observed that the steamer. -was bacldin asterm I continued at the wheel for about five minutes; and' e ster went a-head. One of the menh-belotging-to-the steamer then came forward, and asked me who I was.-'- I told him, 'and he commenced swearing at me,' telling tne- hd no business there. Two of the steamer's boats -Were lowered, and soon afterwards I perceived the lifebobat of the-Josephine Willis'approaching the ilangerton. She brougiht some pssengers, who were taken on board the steasoer.4 The Man. geton wassteaminga-headat the time,-and-the bo&atwas ordered to remain by her, as she would.- go round to the 10500bl0h Willis. .

These witnesses described whattook place when the accidentoccurred, but theirevidence did uot elicit-*ny new fact. Captain George Frederick Westbrook exAned.-I am employed in the Emigr;tion-office as assi7ant emigration bffieer. My duties are to survey emigrantships., I inspected the Josephine Wgilis at Graveseud previo-Luto and on the day Of herx clearanice. She was perfectly fit-to,go to sea. I examined her lights. Her bowsprit lantern was-a very sr.tisfactory light. * r - r. Kester Clayton, chief officer of the J osephineWillis, was here recaUed, and, in answer to Mr. YARDLXY, SaidS,A triple light was hanging at the bowsprit-end at the timne of thd collision. There was a bright lantern on board, placed ready for lighting. I did not sboqwit, because I thought it might confoTe thcaptain of t7aeiapproaching vessel, seeing that there was a green light alrqady on our -starboard bow. George Pearson was the next witness; He said,-I am a channel ilot, but have no license. On the night of the collision I was off Sandgate, in the Deal lugger. Did not. perceiveeitherthe Jose hineWillis or thesteamer until several rockets were fire. We then went in'thB direction of the rockets, and came alongside the steamer. Went on board, and was told by tfhe captain that there had been a- shcking accident; that the steamner had run into a larga ship- and that the steamer Stself'wasSin gre_t danger. I aEreedto taleechargeof The steamDer, andtakeitteap]ace of safety; -nd in the course of 10 minutes-it was7 found that she bad made 18 inches of water.: I told the captain I had better ran her ashore, in order to save both ship, cargo, and lives The captain said he otuld rather 'ay by and see what he could do for the *ship, bet I told bim that the lives of 100 persons on board the steamer - weveatstal-e,andthattheirsafety-nustbe-attendedto. I mut the lugger to the assistance of the-ship, and told thsLifeboat of the Josephine Willis to go aso,0- but three or four of the Josephine's men jumped on board the steamer. I asked if any of the ship's crew were on boDrd, and was to.dthat the chief officer wasihere. I sent four times for him, but he never came, and I did not see him tiU halfpest 4 o'lock thne nextb mornin. The chief officer said nothing to me, but went into a cabin and lay dow;n. By Mr. Ballnntiue.-The captain of the Mangeston ws anxious to go to the assistance of the other vessel, and itwass from the opinionl formed of -the state of the steameritself thatl didnot think itwiseto do so. Idid: not deem it safe to take her any nearer the Josephine Wlllis. Captain Richard BoucEier was then examifned. He said, -I am niaster of the Mangerton, a sorew- steamer of 363 tons registered tonmage, and 130-horse power.' I have been 16 years at sea, and have a master's certificate of compe- - tency. I obtained it in Cork. I havenot been examined for steam. I have been five or six imonths in the co pany's service commandingsteamers between London andLimerick. I have been in co d o- the aer about eight weeks, and had been one-vayage before the co1i- - sion. We leftLimerickmn the.Sth ofJanuay vith a crew of 35, and we had 40 passengers on board at'the time the colision took place, themajoityof whomwere -oen and children. We made Dungeness light. Itwas rather hazy over the -water, but dear overhead. T-he firAt intimationI had that any ship was near was by bearing the second mate cry " Port !" Iwzs in thcecabin at thet*me. It was mv watc2h anid the second mate was in charx'ecoTh voaead mate and a band were on the bridge, two men -were at. the helm, and one at the forecate on the lookout. Before I went below I told the second mate to be *particular in keeping a good lookout for vessels. We lad not much steam on, and were going eight knots an hour. The exclamation "Port !" did not attract my particular attention, but in a minute or two afterwards I heard a call of "H ard a-port P1 and, knowing that -we were near a vessel, I went on deck. I then saw a vessel on our, port bow, abotut a shdips length from us. I caUed out, 'Hard a-port, for God's sake, stOp her -' The order was obeyed, and the engine stopped. the-ve3sel appeared to be tmding across our bow, and outr port bow came into col- lision with her midships. I imminediately' gave an order to - gabthe boats ready to go to the ship's assstance, and afterwards directed the steamer to be hack;ed. My orders were obeyed. There was considerable alarn among the passengers. The steamer was not backed for fully ten minutes after the collision. When I got -clear of her I steamed slowly under the stern of the JosepldneWillis The en- - gines were stopped under her steri, and -we-were within a ships length of the Josephine Willis at the tiwe. I inspected the steamer, and found the water rushing in at the pert bow.

THE CLOCK TOWER AND BELLS. TheEarl of EGLtNTOIJNca]led the attention ofthe noble earl opposite to the state of the clock tower of the building in 'which they were assembled. That beautiful edifice 'was now appreaching completion, and he presumed it was intended thatthe clock face should give information to the public as well as to mnembers of that and the other house respecting the time of day. One dial face was already in its place, and if the other dials were furnshed with the same hieroglyphics which disfigured that one the public at large would not bie much the wiser, althougb their lordships mnight bv this time have acquired some knowledge of raedisvl art. One clock of that kind had been placed in that house, hut had been rep'-rc4 byone marked with ordinary figures, and he thougt that for a clock of the magnitude of that to beplaced in the towrer above the simple nd well-l;nowvn figures should be adopted. He also wished to know whether there was any foundation for the rumour which had gone abroad that the tower had been built, and ws nowr almost roofed in, without leaving anr aperture for the admission of the clock and bels. Let their lordships take care that they did not get dials that could not be read a clock that could not go, and a hell that could not ring. Earl GRhN'VILLE said that, as he did not Inow anything about the subject, he wrote a note to Sir Charles Barry, and he would read to their lordships the answer vhich he had received from that gentleman:- r " Old Palaee -yard, Feb. 15, I@v. Granville,-The best answer I can send to your note is the enclosed diagram of the ,"reat clock laces, which I think you will agree with me wiJl be siuffieiently inteligible. The truth is that the clearness of the numerals is of little importance, if their position is clearly defined within sonic definite form that will duly correspond -with the point of the hour hand; the clearnessof the division of the minutes is realy of the only great iPportae,m and you will see. therefore, that an unusual pro- imnence is given to the minute hand forthat purpose. "MDost faitfll~yyours,~ 'With regard to the other question put by the noble earl, he was happy to say that he had been assured that the statem2ent was without foundation. UNCONSECRIATED BURIALGROUNDS. Lord BROUGHA M presented a petition from the inhabitants of the city of Carlisle, complaining of a grievance they were labouring under arising out of the eperation of the law regulating burialgrounds. They xtated that their old burislground had been closed, and that a field had been assigned to them in the neighbourhood of the towin for a burialground. They fenced it all round, asid then made a road of 20 feet wide through the field for the purpose of separating the consecrated from the unconsecrated ground-the former oeing for the members of the church of England, and the latter for Nonconfornmsts. The bishop of the diocess, however, laboured under the impression that-he was not at liberty to consecrate any portion of the ground muless it was entirely closed in; and he did not consider a road to constitute a sufficient fence or enclosure. Assuming that the graveyard which was to Ibe consecrated was required to be separated altogether from the other parts of tl.e field, no doubt it might be said that the right rev. prelate was right not to consecrate it, because there was no further separation than the road, 20 feet vide. The consequence of this decision of the bishop, whether right or wrong, had been most unfortunate, for, as the ground was not consecrated, no clergyman of the church of England could perform the funeral service, and the result was that the service had been performed by Nonconformist clergymen. The petitioners represented this to be a great evil and painfulto their feelings. They made no charge against the sight rev, preate they only complained of theunfortunate result of the scrnples he entertained, and they prayed that a remedy might be provided either by dispensing with the necessity of consecrating the burialground, or declaring that the clergy of the church of England might lawfully read the service ofthe church at any funeral, although the burialground had not been consecrated, provided it was certified as being fit for the purposes within the burial act, withovut incurring any penalty or ecclesiastical censure thereby. Me (Lord Broughanm) undoubtediy felt that there might he very great difliculty in regard to the mode of proceeding ruggested by the petitioners; blut he thought that some ether remedy might be afforded without resorting to that course. The Bishop of EXETER thought it would be very difficult to devise a remedy for the grievance corlaIined of without acting contrary to the law of the church. There was, however, one moee or reauer uptusi v but; Libiv_au- . Ife had seen the written opinion given by an eminent lawyer who had been consulted on the subject, and who did not hesitate to say that, supposing the bishop refused to consecrate the ground, inasmuch as it was not in a state fit to be consecrated, any party feeling aevethereby might go to the Court of Queen's Bench an a ply for a mendaanus. He observed the noble Lord Chief Justice shook his head. Lord CAMPBELL.-We certainly should not grant a mnandamuis, because we should have no jmuisdiction. The Bishop of EXETER did not mean that a sncdoamus could be issued commanding the bishop to consecrate the ground, but that it might be issued to the burial board, crderingthemtoputthe ground inafit state tobe consecrated. [lord CAalrrBELas made a motion of assent.] HIe rejoiced to see that his noble and learned friend recognized that position, which he (the Bishop ef Exeter) wasaboutto state 'when he was interrupted by his noble and learned friend's Lord Burleigh-like shake of ithe head, and they ,ll knew vhat great men meant by a shake of the head. (A laugh.) It appeared, then, that those who felt aggrieved in this case had a remedy in their ownm hands. Let them apply for a inendeetur,Z and if that were refused, then possibly they might have a case to lay befere Parliament. Be had read the petition, and he perceived that the first grievance was, that it wioud be offensive to the feelings of those who were not members of the church. He presuned, therefore, that some of these petitioners were not members of thechurch ;but if that were so, if by an act of their own they did that which was offensive to their feelings he was sorry for it, though in one way it might lead to good, inasmuch as it might lead them to consider the fitnesa of putting themselves in another position. To the church it was certainly not offensive to see a space of ground set apart for the burial of these who did not belong to the church; and he bad never heard a Churhman in this house, or anywhere else, express the elightest disapprohation of the law which provided for another place of sepulture for Dissenters. If this provision were offensive to Dissenters it must surely be iecauwe it was annoymg to them that they iere not considered members of the church; or else, why should they complain9 If, indeed, this were a measure forced upon them by the Govenment, and one in the passmn of which they had borne no part, then they might cornp lain. UJnless, however, Parliament thought fit to set aside the law ahich settled the rights of sepudture in this country, and the aights of the church in the grounds that were appointed for sepulture. there must be a p lace of special enlosure fortheburials of the church. The petitioners stated that the canons of the church said noug about consecration, and therefore they complained of consecration. Now,lv that a Churchman should Join in declaring that this rite was a thiny which ought tohe put an end to, had one for which there wra no awuthor ty in the Book of Common Prayer and in the canons, he confessed, thororghly amazed him. But, setting thiat aside, why should there be such eagerness to be buried in consecrated ground if there were really nothing ci consecration ? Everybody kne the decided feeing on this subject weich existed in the minds of Churchmen, and therefore he was wholly at a loes to understand how tha petitioners, if Churchmen, could make such a statement as that he had noticed. To show the laws v hich regulated the church on this subject, he might refertd the SSth canon of 103, which stated that it was the duty of the ohurchwardens "to take care that the churchyards shall he richard sufficiently repaired, fenced, and niaintained with walls, rails, or pales." In syndwood, Dc tecatis deilcated is it was mentioned that the constitntion of tinchiLsea declared that the parish was hioucd to build and repair the guusu-eram cmeftesii. In Comfnsns Digcet heo found it laid down that the chulrchyard was totus fundus qeli ia r cogiasuaem d psios co-ktinehuis (Statute30 wth of E. LI The rector tresteastut hecaro s it caemetei-o.) " Because we do understand that controversies do ofttimes grown betweet parsons and their parishioners tochig trees growing in the chrchyard, &c.-forasmtuch as a churchyard that is dedicated is the seillof the church, it mus needs followr that those trees which he growing in the churacyard are to be reckoned amont the goods of the church." The same lawwas rec ognired by Lord Coke in his jsintiitutes, where, comnientinr .on the statute, he calls it :ntreatise, .and said that; the parishioners ought to repair , e enclosure of the churchynrd,because-.-1ca consetdiner.s, p2oa-esna a eapproa-eben^, and the conusauce thereof was alkwed by this act. Their lordships must xepsember, too, that this was not a fiction of Lord Coke; it was a commpep*ary uoon an existing aet of Parliament, {he plain vores ot vh hch wvere before him. The petitioners said there -s already a boundary, and if that were intended by them ±e satisfy the demands of the church in th-is rqespet, he had.iB objection to it if only they carried it out to its egitinmate&onclusion; but then, according to the statutes he i qu6ted,all the ground within the fence belonged to the ,church; it ea7s the da2usui's ce7nseterii; and evevthing iwsch grew whiin such a boundary belonged to the church. A6e id not, bowvever, wish to drive them to this £CqUq1uson; ihe 4snly wished to point out to the peti- '(azs JAow .very little grouLnd they had for the coma.

Ho did say, however, that no man who attended the service of the church could hesitate to feel that schism was a grievous and deadly slin, from which he would pray God to deliver bin. The church must and would, as she was bound to do, discharge the duty which devolved upon her, even although the course which she pursued might be offensive to the feelins of cersons who called themsdlves Churchmen, but who m reality could not be so. That reason he had, he believed, disposed of, and another ground that was advanced was that of expense. Now, as to the expense, that would only be the amount vhich was re uired to build a smial brick wall, and, as their lordships who were in the habit of making roads through their demesnes were aware, that amount conuL not be set against the sum which would be required to make a coach road -20 feet wide. He did not think that any future Bishop of Carlisle would require a very high wall, uit was his duty to re- a wall to be built, and that duty he was bound to per- -Earl GRANVILLE said that, although he thought that the noble and learned lord would be distin - hed in any position, still he could not say he though sthat, i placerd on the eccesiasticalsbench, hewould be the right man in the right place - while, with regard to the right rev. prelate, he thought* tha5t if he was not a distingulished member of the ecclesiastical bench he would beta very CUtinentlawlord. During the passage of the Burial Amendment Actitwassuggested to theGovernment to insert some clause to remedy the evil which was, complained of, but the Government did not feel themselves justfied in giving to a Secretary of State the power of overrling the ecclesiastical F law. Inhisopinion, seme:discretion was allowable in admi3nistering the law, and, sO far from agreeing with the right rev. prelate, lie, for his part, hoped that any future Bishop of Car lisle would be inclined to deal with the sub-I ject in armoderate way, and not to follow a small minority of his brethren. lord CAMPBELL said that with regard tot talndemus the Court would consider the question; but if the bishop certified that the burisiground was not ma proper state to be consecrated it would not interfere. MINISTER OF JUSTICE. Lord BROUGHAl gave notice that that day week he should hringheforetlseir lordahips vy erianlt resolution respecting the establishinent of a Mimaterof Justice to preside over a department wvhich, as regarded the collection of judicial statistics and other matters of a lke character, should exercise functions similar to those dicharged by departuents of justice on the continent. EDUCATION BIL Earl GBMIVILLE moved the second reading of this bil The main point of the bill was founded upon a suggestion made by SLr J. Palcington, who had displayed a great knowledge of the subject. That right hon. gentleman had, with most laudable energy, treated the subject as a great social question, entirely apart from party feeing, and he had suggested that, considering the large grants of public money whicl were made for educational purposes, it was desirable that some Minister should sit in the House of Commons responsible for the conduct of the department of educ%tion, and who could answ#r any question that might .be pat to him on the subject That suggestion had been attended to in the present bill, and it was proposed to assimilate the construction of the Committee of Council to that of the Board of Trade, the dice-president of the council being the responsible Minister in the House of Commons. The Earl of DERBY thought that the time had arrived when there should be a separate department established especially charged with the education of the country. Probibly the mode proposed by his noble friend of carrying out the proposition was the best that could be adopted; that was to say, the appointment of a subordinate Minister in the other house, or in their lordships! house, if the President of the Council happened to be in the House of Commons, to represent the department, on the same principle as the Board of Trade was represented. But if the time had arrived for charging a responsible Minister with the duties of instruction, was it not also time to supersede the Privy Council altogether in this matter, and to maL-e the Mfinister really and in fact responsible for the education of the people? (Hear.) The President of the Council had various other duties to perform; and he was not sure, although heavy duties no doubt devolved upon the Prime Minister, that that high functionary might not very effectually and very satisfactorily discharge the duties which fell upon the President of the Council, prodded that the matter of education were withdrawn from the Council. (Hear, hear.) He had a strong feeling that the institution of a Minister of Instruction at the present moment was desirable; that the subject should be altogether separated from the Privy Council; and that the duties of the President of the Council might be attached to those of the Minister now called the E irst Lord of the Treasury, who might be relieved from the nominal duties connected with the Treasury. This, however, would open a very large question, into which he was not at present prepared to enter. He had no objection to the bill, the second reading of which had just been proposed, understanding that its object was to render the department of education a substantial office presided over by a responsible MIinister; and he said upon this, as upon most other questions, that a single responsible Minister was much more efficient than a board, howvever respectable and able the members constituting that board might be. (Hear, hear.) Lord MONTFAGLE expressed his approval of the bill, and an objection to the system of boards, which, as applicable to one subject complete in itself, was productive of a diminution of the responsibility of the head of the department, and, by associating that person with others who could not attend, because they had neither time nor opportunity for administering the functions which nominally devolved r au, d -lv IoA +^ -nfnsion and dissatisfaction. IBe rejoiced that in this instance a better system was being adopted; and when he saw the progress which had been made in the education question nif late years he must say that, in his opinion, the time had come when they ought to malke the responsibility -for the education of the people direct, and when that responsibility should be in immediate cormexion with Parliament. (Hear.) The bill had also an important bearing upon the encouragement given to science and art. He was far from under. valuing either of those great objects, but let them be pursued with discretion and upon the principle of successful experiments. Their lordships were not in the habit of meddling with the financial accounts;, but he recollected a noble friend of his taling up the estimates a few years ago and showing the multiplication of offices and growth of expenditure which were going on year by year under the title of encouragement of science and art, while a controversy was raging as to whether the miserable sum of 1,0001. per annum, given to the Royal Society for the undeniable encouragement of science, should be continued or not. At the s-me time, they were creating a new department, perhaps, more expensive than all the Cabinet offices taken together. He was glad that the bill provided for the appointmient of a responsible Minister, because that would insure a closer inspection of the accounts, for which he knew not who was responsible at present. There was another point to which he was anxious to call attention. The system of education in Ireland differed in its administration from that in England. He understood that the biU did not touch the question of Irish education at al, therefore he would not say a word with respect to the general principles of that system; but if there was one lesson which they might learn from the administration of education in Ireland, it was that to place it in the hands of a large number of irresponsible persons, who had other laborious duties to perform, was not the best mode of attaining the object in view. He agreed with a noble earl who preceded him that two able public officers ougEt to be sufficient to perform all the duties connected with the administration of education, provided always that their hearts were in the subject, and no person whose heart was not in the suhject should undertake such important functions. The Earl of EILENBOROUGH so far disagreed from t-he noble lord who spoke List that his opinion was, and had always been, that if they wished to have a department well conductedbthey should place it in the hands of one able gentleman; and he certainly did hopce that this bill was intended to deleg,ate al the duties conneced with' education substantially to the-one oficer who was to represent the board in the House of Commons. It was quite enough work for one man, and that work would never be wel done until it was confided to one man only. He thought that the more, because it appeared to him most desirable, if it were possible, and as far as it could be possible, to separate the department of education from the political changes which affected the Government. (Hear, hear.) That beng his impression, he should look with the greatest anxiety to the appointment which the Government might think fit to make of the officer who, in the other house, was to be responsible for the education of the country. It was of the utmost importance that he should not be a person of extreme opinios either hin politics, in religion, or eveni with respect to education itself If he were aman of extreme opinions in palitics or religion they might depend upon it that he would not receive te cotoperation of theresidentgentry and clergy, and without that co-operation it would be impossible for him successfully to carry on the business of ns department. If he should entertain eaerated and extravagant views with respect to education itself, it was to be feared he would be defeated, and instead of doing good would be likely to do harm. There were men so enthusiastic on the subject that for the object of having a literary peasantry they would sacrifice the useful labour of theco,mtry. H]ear, hear.) He entertained a totally dlifferent opinion. He had seen a good deal of the practical workring of schools, and he knew that for the maintenance of the respectability of the labouring classes it was absolutely essential that their sons should he permitted to commence labour at the earlest moment at which it became profitable, and they could by earning wages relieve the difficulties of their families. (Hear, hear.) The period of greatest difficultyto a labouring man was that which occurred betwreen nmarriage and the&time at which the eldest son attaied the age whe u he ld earn money for his own supprt. That was the real period of agony. If they pro- longed it by saying that two, three, or four years more sinuld be taken from the useful labour of his sons for 'the purpose of making them personsof more literary knowledge, they wouldnflictthe greatest possible injury u wn every labouring man in the country; they would force farmily into the workhouse, where his sons would receive their education, and thoy would destroy that sentiment of independence and respectability which - they ought to uphold. Continuoeg labour was of infinitely more value to a poor man than literary instruction, which fitted him neither for one ;hing nor another; and it was earnestly to be hoped that tho5e who were to conduct the education of the country would bear in mind that it was essential to the respectability, the ,appiness, even the existence of the labo g classes that 'hey should be enabled at the earliest moment to avail thems,slves of the services of all the members of their families. ({Zea, bear.) Earl GREY concurred very much in the opiions expressed by the noble earl, and beheved thltt heretofore too high a standard had -been required in schlwhaderv, and stil more iL schoolmistresses. (Hear, hear. 'While the department of education had demanded very hgh -Ute- rary qaifications, it had not required what was far maic essential-a knowlewie of useful arts ad emplciyments in which the labouring cliaaex corud be trained. Such a quali-.n fication was of the utmos consequence'twith 'esec' to schoelnistresses. (c e, hear.)'Ihs hppiness of a-poor man's family generally depended upon the handianess and ikil ublessof his wife in nuaing tte ordiiary affairs of she household, and that was a Por+;on of education of which bighly accomplished schooluiters and school'nistresses, who could recite the list o' Pofp s from the earliest times to the present, and kaew tile rtitude and longitude of every obscure town ;~ the world, were very often extremely ignorant. 'fiear hear.) He agreed with the noble earl that adepaS,ment to'be efficiently conducted must be placed under the superintendence of one individuaL There inl$st J?V9iitperonsupreme; batiE the supremacy of the chieF v ere acknowlyedged, he thought that a board might be u*lful for pusposes of consultation, provided that the subordinate members distinctly understood that it was their duty. to defer to the opinions of their head. H}e Eikewise thought that if there sns to be an efficient department of education, it would not be the wisest pLan to unite its managetent with the Presidency of the Council. Looking at the manner iu which Parliamentary bsiners had increased of late years, and the additional duties thas thrown on the Govermnent-eorsidering how necessary it wasthatthere should be one person in each house fully acwiainted with all the generalbusiness of the Government, and shle to ansvber such questions as might be patto binm on matters of public polEcy-ha thought that the person discharging ths duty, either in tliat or the other house of Parliament, shoald be relieved from the responsibiEties of any heavy departiment. (ear, hear.) It was desirable that the Prndencs of the Coancil should alwags be in one hoase of ParEament and the First Lord of the Treasur v in the other; and he thoaght that if this arrangement were adopted the President of the Council, who stood already nearly highest, in point of dignity in the Government, should be put on an equality intpoint of salar with the Secretaries of State. It was perfectly clear that at present he could not devote his whole time to the subject of education. While on this topic le could not help suggesting that the time had really come when a revision of the incubers and duties of the darious Pareamentday offices ought t. take place. Withiu these four years there had been brought he did not knowv how many persions holding official situations into Pariament; while, on the other hand, they had maintained unaltered certain Parliamentary offlces of long standing to whieh no duties were now attachedch, for example, as that of the Chancellorship of the avuhy of lancaster. (Hear.) It was not wise to go on fraing new officestotvhichimportant duties were a.ttached, and, at the same time, to retain old offices without any dutie whatever. He therefore thought a eomplete revision of the wholeEoffies of Parliament should be instituted, in order to determine which should be retained andwhich should not. Hear, bear.) Lord BROUGHrs epressed the great satisfactior which hebad experienced on hearing from the President of the Council thie nature of the measure he had that tiight announced, and at the prospoct we now had of havmng a real educational departmentinthis country. It was now 18 years sine he had attempted toestablish sacha department, and he then fet, as he dld now, the incalculable importane ofiohaitg a single and uldivided and, thereFore, effectual resfonsibnlity. Hls noble friend (Lord unconteagle) had referred to the measures which were taken by Lord Grev's Govemment on this question; lnt was fitting that he should remind them of the previous laboars of the elebrated EducationfCommittee ofsthejHouse of Commons. It was their recommendations, it was the resolutions they had reported to the House of Commons, though not adopted by that}hoase, respecting a grant of money for educational purposes that were acted upon by Lord Grey's Government an 183r, and which laid the foundation of that educational ystem we nowfposs.eseda (Hear, hear.) Avery difflcult question had been raised by his noble friend near him-vio, wiether the deriartnenr should be in the hands of an individual removab'e with the Government, makting the offlce what was commonly called a political offices or whether it ought to be, as his noble frienl was inclined to thiso, an unpolitical offfce, the holder of v.hichshould be unremovable with the Govermnment. He was not prepared to adopt his noble friend's plan of having theoffice unconnected with the Government to the extent of not being removable. That plan hand, no doubt, great advantages, and some difficalties and inconveniences might arise from the office beimasabject, to chango; but, looking atth advantagesandra r vantages ontboth sides, he incined to the opinion that the ainister of Education should be removable with the Government. He begged to tender his thanks to the Goverenent for having introduced a messure which hetrusted woauld lay the foundation of great fulture usefulness. (Hear, hear.) The duc arqias of iANSDOWNE was glad tonnd that the measure had received such general sup post fromi their lordships. He agreed vwith his noble and learned friend who had just spoken in thinking that some advantages might be derived fromat thlinister of Education not being removable with the Government, hut that there were counterbalancing advantages which made it desirable tha. it shsesd be a moveable office. The daties of thg office should he carried on in comnexion with the Government of the day. Qaestions connected with education would be perpetually arising in which the Minister of Education msight take a different view of the subject from the Government, and this wouldo interfere wita the efficiency of the establshment and retard the pfrgoress of wthe very cause it was instituted to promote. (Hear.) The noble earl opposite had referred to thehearigs of this question on the labours of the hmtbler classes. He agreed with him as to the necessity that existed for laborers' .sons being employed at a very early age; but it was always extremely difficult to lay down a general rule on this subject. There were many parts of the country where a good system of education was quite compatible with the ordinary pursuits of labour, and he should therefore besorryto laydown any general rule as to age. This must be a questicn between the MIinister of Educationrand theg idependent poor, for bethought their independence ought alwayc to be considered in this mdtter, as they mast be the best judges of their own necs sities, andhave control over their owln families. (Hear, hear.) He conceived that the system of education had been greatly improved of late yeals, and that much more usec and practical knowledge was now impa:rted, especially by schoolmistresses, than was formerly the cas. Hewas happyto find that what he regarded as a very important branch of education-the sience of cokery-had of late receivedspecial attention. ("Hear," andalangh). Heethoghtthe responsibility of those officers to whom it was proposed to commit the superintendence of the educational system would be in no measure dhuicished by their being enabled, when they deemed it necessary, to obtainthe assistaceoftheCommittee of Council. He could assare their lordships that occasions arose when it was a great advantage to the President oftheCoancil,inadmini5termng such a department, that he should be enabled, when information with regard to particular localities or circumstances was required, to call upon the committee for their advice and assistance, without devolving any portion of his responsibility upon them. lord COLCIIESTEE asked, whether it was intended to place under the control of the Poinister of Education the whole department of science and art, which was now under the superitendence of the Board of Trade? He thought it wars advisable that the department of nautical scdence, wthich was particularly connected with the Board of Trade, should still remain in connesion with that beard. deparl education arnswer to to he question of the noble lord, I beg to say that I quite agree with hiu in the opinion that the best coutse would be to leave the department of nautical science under the control of the Board of Trade. I can assre the noble lord (Mohteatle) who has asked whether this bill will interfere With the system oE education in Ireland, that it eill in no respect arffect that system, and that we do not intend to assme any power whatever wi;th regard to natioisal education in that country. The noble marquis has answiered most of the objections which have oeen raised in the course of the debate, but one point has been mentioned upon which I feel I did not giva your lordahips, in the abort statement I made, a su'diciently clear e.xplanation. Several noble lords have urged the importance of unityof direction with regardl to this department. I did not mean to cenvey any other impression. It is intended that the President of the Council himself be responsible for the conduct of the depar ment, and that the viee-President shall be appointed to act under the ordersof thePresident, and forhia nn is absence, and that he shall be subordinate to the head of the department. With regard to those persons who bold seats at the hoard cz ogffco, thley will will not share the responsibility more than other members o' the Government; but we thought that, retaining the entire responsibility in the head of the board, it would be advisable to constitate sach linisters as the President of the Poor Law Boardi, and other beads of departments, ec: officio members, in order to facilitate any reference to them thlat might be necessary. An objection has been raised to thePresident of the Councilbeing theperson selectedtoactas Ministerof Instruction. If ed some difficulty in defending this prevision, owing to the fact that I am myself the President of the Council, and I feel very strongly how unequal I nam to undertake the important duties attached to that office ia connexion wvith education;but I must confess I cannot see that any practical inconvenience can arise from the arrangement. I do not think the President of the Council is so fully employed by the duties of his office that there can be any objection to his taking the department of education, supposing him to be a fitting person, unmder his own direction. It has been suggested that the Minister of Instruction should be a permanent Minister, but I agree with my noble friends who think it e.xpedient that the head of that department should change with the Government. I have been in several departments of the public service, and I have found among mv subordinates men who were infinitely more able than a m, and who ;cossessed far more info,rmation with respect to the several departments thanI cou:ldpretend to; and yet I think advantages aretobefoundinthe system of change. Thenoble earl has said there is danger that men of exstreme opinions may have the control of education, hut that is just as likely to happen if you have a permanent head of the department as if you make the Minister removable wi-th the Governmlent. If I did anything objectionable ia the Committee of Council. my conduct would I?robably b e canvassed by noble lords in this house, and I might b succeeded by a colleague of the noble earl opsite, whi might come into office with different ideas, and who migh' pursue a very different course. If the department were not represented in Parliament, I think similar inconveniences would be felt to those which were expelienced in the case of the old Poor Law Board (bear, hear); and, if the board is to be represented in Parliaraent, it is almost impossible that you shoul4 have a permauient head of the department. (Hear, hear.) Some other cuestions of importance have been ntroduced into this discussion. One of my noble frietds has referred to the department of science and'art, and has raisedsome objectioni to the mode in which it ha; been conducted. I think it would not be convenient that f should go intothat-question'now, but in two or three weeks hence 1 shall be prepared to enter fully into the sub- ject, and to show wJat has been done by that department. Withregard tothe general subject of education, Icannotquite agree with the noble earl opposite. There is, I think, a tendency on the part of highy educated men in this country zather to discountenance the e ducation of thefpoorercGasses, and to express doubts as to the expediency of giving them any very general instruction. In that feeling I do net concur. I quite admit that i . would be extremely difficult, by any compulsory enactment, to deprive parents of the ,eaaeft of their children's labour in order that they~ m'n}lj6 receivg instrucotion; but if a child is taunght p,r ,trIa1P.q} by a peson e.xereisipg a particular branch c£f industry, and whose interest it isto make him work as hard as hcan,the probability is that any education the child has received. up to tho age of 10 or 11 vrill beentirely throwrn away.> 1 think, however, that by the half-time system you may be enabled to aflord eaucation in a nanner mosti convenient to the employers 'of labour, to the parents of children, and to the children themselves. I know that the noble earl entertains very strong feelings on the subject of over-educating children, Mnd thereby inc aviXtaiag them for tshgse employments which are susted so their station in life. I rememlber hearing that, on visiting the Greenwich schools, he expresed very natural surprise at -finding the boys there se highly educated, and he might think that boys so educated would be unlikely to enter either the Royal navy or the mercantile marine. I have seen-and I regret that I have not it with me-a very interesting report made by Mr. Canon Mosele, in 150, with! reference to those schools. and which contains some curious statistical details. It appears that, before tho education in those schools was as good as it now in, very few of the boys educated there went into either the navy or the mercantile marine, and those who did so turned outvery badly oa board ship; but now, out of a very Large number of scholars, all, with the exception of about 40, have entered the navy or the mercantile marine, andthereportswhichhavebeen receivedoftheirconduct show that they have almost universally proved the best sailors in the respective services. I think this fact shows that the apprehensions entertained of the effects of too high an education are unfounded. When it is considered that the young p e to whom the system of education of which we have eeen speaking applies are seldom at school for more than four or five years, I do not think there is any great probability tshat they can be over-educated. I know it has been said that the certificated schoolmasters and mistresses are too highly trained. I think if you took a certain number of the most highly trained schoobnistresses you would find them, as regards a knowledge of common things, such as sewing and the elements of cookery, infinitely better teachers than the inferior class of dames who formerly taught those things. It is undoubtedly a great object to introduce a general knowledge of those commnon things which are so useful in after life, and the inspectors have been instructed to urgeand stimulate the teaching of those things. That is now generally done, and I think there will be same utility in the proposed junction of the department of science with the department of education in the Privy Council, as it will tend to introduce better teaching of the elementary parts of science in the common sohools. I do not know that there is any other point to which it is necessary I should now refer, and have only to thank the House for the favourable manner in which it has received this measure. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH desired to impress upon the noble earl and the House the distinction between boys and girls in relation to the subject of education. A boy was required to go to work several years earlier than a girl, and it was therefore impossible to give boys so high an education without violating family rights and infficting serious injury on parents. It was far more important to provide good. schoohnistresses than highly trained masters, because girls could continue their education longer than boys; and, from all he had seen and heard, he was convinced that the best mode of promoting improvement in the great body of the poorer classes was Dyimparting a superioreducation to those vho were to be tho wives of labourers and the mothers of their families. (Rear.) If they were made, as they could be made, well-conditioned persons, possessing full knowledtge of all those things which were useful for the management of families dependent upon small means, they wvould acquire an influence which would be beneficial alike to their hunbands, to their children, and to themselves. The bill was then read a second time. HOUSE OF COMMONS OFFICES BILL. This bill was read a second time. METROPOITAN POLICE BlLL Earl GRANTVILLE moved the second reading of this bilL Lord CMIPBELL did not object to the bill, but wished to point out something which it did not contain, and which it might most usefuUy eontain. There was a valuably body of men, the police m agistrates,who performed their arduous and intricate duties with great zeal and ability, who, to complete a perfect police system, should no longer be rendered liable to dismissal at the pleasure of the Crown, as at present. He did not propose that magistrates should be entirely exempted from control, or the liability of dismissal in cases of misconduct, but would propose a domestic tribunal composed of a selection from the judges, to whom all complaints against olice magistrates should be referred, and who should decide whether the facts proved warranted the penalty of dismissaL He could hardly expect his noble friend would introduce such a clause at the present stage of the bill, but he hoped the Government would take the matter into their consideration, with a view to the adoption of some such plan. Lord PANTMURE said that, having had sixlyears' experience in the Home-office, he might be excused for making a few remarks in reply to the noble and learned lord. During the time he was at the Home-office he saw the very great convenience of the power of dismissal which his noble and learned friend had condemned, and in one or two instances that power vas exercised, to the great advantage of the public and of the administration of justice. He was quite certain that no Secretary of State would venture, in the face of Parliament and the public, upon an exercise of that power from personal considerations or unworthy motives. The police magistrates at present discharged their duties with great care and propriety, but if they were to be placed upon the same footing as the judges of the superior courts and rendered irremoveable, those gentlemen might, as they had done in former times, fall into the error of taking extreme views of the law, than which nothing was more likely to bring the administration of jstice into contempt. He therefore hoped his noble and learned friend would see tho propriety of leaving those gentlemen, as at present, responible to the Secretary of St.te for the due performance or their duties. LordCAMPBELL saidthat his sentiments were not in the slightest degree altered by what had fa7len from his noble friend, who hnad urged nothing to show that any inconvenience would arise from the adoption of the proposal he (Lord Campbell) had made. The bill was then read a second time. THE CPIEAN REPORT. Lord PANIURE said that two letters had been forwarded to him, one by the Earl of Cardigan and the other by the Earl of Lucan, in reference to the report of Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel TuUoch on the state of the army in the Crimea, and he now begged to lay them on the table, and move that they be printed.-Ordered. Their lordships adjourned at 20 minutes after 7 o'clock.

Mr. 'WIGRA31 wished to give no opinion on the merits whether certain clauses shodv bs retained in the biD, as that question could be determined better in committee, but be supported the second reading because, with the exception of two clauses, it did carry out sticetly the award of Sir J. Patteson. Colonel ADAIR also supported the second reading, affrming that the bill was not contradictory, but supplementary to the award of the arbitrator. Mr. STANFORD appealed to the hon. member to withI draw his amendment, and allow the bill to be considered in a committee upstairs. The amendment was withdrawn, and the bill vas then read a second time and ordered to be comraitted. STATUTES OF EXETER COLLEGE,OXFORD.

Mr. CAIRNS.-Are there no letters between the Board of Trade and the Foreign-office onthe sabject?

Mr. PELLATT begged to ask the First Lord of the Treasury, whether the Sultanl's recent edicts, granting civil and religious equality to all his subjects, abolished the penalty of death upon aMussulman becominga Chitian, and, if not, whether Goverinnent would exert its diplomatic influence to repeal that law? Lord PALMERSTON.-The Government have received a telegraphic communication, stating that certain edicts have been signed by the Sifitan, but the edicts themselves have not yet reached this eountry. I wil not say what may be the effect of those edicts, but I will assure my hon. friend and the House that the Government have for manyyears earnestly urged the abolition of the penalty to which he ad verts, and, that if it does not form ipart of that elict, no exertions shall be wanting to induce the Sultan to abolish that penalty. At the same time my hon. friend and the House must see that matters relating to reEgious opinions and prejudices of this kind are very difficult to handle. The Turks have persecuted until lately Mussulmans who have become Christians, but it must be remembered th at in some of the Italian States Christians have been persecuted who have changed from one sect of that religion to another. D1ECIMAL COINAGE. Mr. WARNER wished to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether the Government were about to takeLmea sures for cartying into effect the resolution of the House of last session in favour of a further adaptation of the coinage to the decimal system ? The CHANCELLR of the EXCHEQUER.-The Govermment have taken steps in consequence of the resolution to which my hon. friend has alluded. A commission has been issued under the great seal to three persons qualified to inquire into the subject, vin., Lord Montengle, Controller of the Exchequer, Lord Overstone, and Mfr. Hubbard, late Governor of the Bank of England. These commissioners are now acting in discharge of their duties, and the subject is under their consideration. In due time they will make a reporb, which wil be laid before Parliament. THE IMPLICATED CRIMEAN OEFICERS. Mr. PALK begged to ask whether itwas the intention of Her Majestys Government to take any steps to ascertain the correctness of the allegations reflecting on the conduct of certain officers in Sir Johnl'NeTl's report? Mr. PEEL.-The House is already aware that several of the officers have announced their intention to make a statement in explanation of their conduct. I shall this evening lay on the table the answers of Lord Lucan and Lord Cardigan to the report in question. Mr. PALK, in consequence of the answer he had just received,beggedtogivenoticethatonanearlydayheshouldmove a resolution, that the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Supplies of the British Army in the Crimea be referred to a select committee of the House of Commons, and that it be an instruction to the commission to ascertain whether the allegations made in that report against many officers of high rank were borne out by the evidence. (Cheers.) Mr. LAYARD had already given notice of a motion on this subject, which he had been obliged to postpone until Thursday week. He found, however, that his motion was so low down in the list that there was no chance of its coming on. It was of great importance to many members to know when it would come on; and, as the subject was a Government one, the First Lord of the Treasury would probably give him a day. (A laugh.) The Government might, he thought, fairly do this, and might give him that day fortnight for his motion. - lord PAIM STON1-That sort of appeal may be a very fair one towards the close of the session, when private members have only one day in the week open to motions, and when the period is fast approaching the termination of the session. But we are now just at the beginning of the Session, when hon. members have two days in each week for their motions, and when the business of the Government is very pressing. I think, therefore, the hon. gentleman might as well try the ballot again, and acquire as a right what he is now asking for as a favour. (A laugh.) Sir J. PAKiGTON thought the answer of -the Under Secretary for War did not meet the question of his hon. friend (Mr. PaTh). The hon. gentleman had said that the answers of Lord Lucan and Lord Cardigan would be laid on the table that evening; but he wished to ask whether the offlcers implcated in that report, and who were not members of the Legislature, would have the same opportunity of malkng their defence that was extended to Lord Lucan and lord Cardigan because they were peers? Mr. PEEL had already stated that General Airey intended to make an answer to the charges which affected the Quartermaster-General's department. As soon as these and any other Teplies were in the possession of the Government, they would be laid before the House. DUTY ON FIRE INSURANCE. lMr. PALK wished toask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it was his intention to repeal the duties on fire assurance, which it had been stated enabled foreign companies to inusre at a less premium in consequence of their freedom from a similar tax ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER-In answer to the question of tlle hon. gentleman, I beg to state that it is not my intention to make any proposal for the repeal of the duty. In the event of the companies paying that duty being exposed to unfair competition with untaxed polies of assurance, it will be ray duty to bring in a measure of a different character for the protection of the revenue and the interests of thaose companies which may be subject to that competition. (Cheers.J ROUTINE LIST OF OFFICERS FOIL PROMOTION. Mr. IAYARD.-I beg to ask a question of the Under Secretary for Var of which I have given him notice. After he despatch of General Simpson contaiing the accoumt of the attack on the Redan, a second despatch, bearing date September 18, was forwarded to Lord Panmure, giving the usual routine list of officers, including those of the staff engaged in the attack. To that despatch, when published, was appended a significantnote fromLordPanmnure, stating, that the list of officers recommended for promotion for distmguished services had not yet been received. I wish to ask if that recommendation has been received, and if it has, why it has not been published, and whether the Government would have any objection to lay upon the table the despatehes from General Codrington and General Wyndham containing an account of the attack upon the Redan ? Mr. PEEL-The hon. gentleman has notput his question very cearly, but I will answer it as well as I am able. Of course, General Codrington, General Wyndham, and the other officers in command of the divisions or brigades concemed in the attack on the Redan, made reports-to General Simpson, upon which General Sinipson iounded his report. General Simpson did not, however, think it necessary to send home those reports at the time, and, although they have sirc<come into the possession of the Government, it has not been deemed advisable to publish them in the G3aztte Mr. LYARD.-1Wll that list of officers recommended for distinguished services be given to us? - Mr. PEEL-I wiUl make inquiries about it. OFFICERS OF THE HOUSE. On the motion that the House at its rising adjourn ti Monday next,- M1r. BANKES asked whether any arrangement had been made for securing to the Speaker for the time being the nomination or recommendation to the Grown of- the officers of this House, more especially those who sat at the table ? Lord PALMERSTON said, the bill now in - rogress through the house gave the appointment of thpse of icers to the Crown, according to an anrangement 'made some time ago. He should deem it-to be his duty-and no doubt his successors would feel it to be their duty-to -place the ap pointments so made on record, and to act under the advice of the Speaker with regard to them. Mr. BA3KES observed that the power bf appointment was, then, in fact, vested in the Treasury. The motion for adjourhment vas then agaed to. OUR RELATIONS WITH AMERIOA. On the order of the day being read for going into Committee of Supply, - Mr. ROEBUCK rose to caU the attention of the House to our relations with the United States of Amer,ica The hon. and learned ger.tknan said,-It is incumbent en me X miakeanapolqoy t. The *ITouse forbringing forward a :notioza onthissbject. Ithai been stated bytheGoveranmentitTougk the medium of tbi l-.Xe lord at its head, that thereaon why 'io meotlon wa.. i'a:ka Li the Speech from the Throne on the subject of America wvas that the negotiations were now la such a condition that they could not, in fairnen to all parties, be publishved at present. The noble loid, there. fore, appealed to the House and said-"Do you think, under these circumastauces that I ought to have wade public anl incorrect satatei3enit of the affairs in question??' I quite agree with the noble lord that it would have bee wrong to do so, but as I believe thatsilence would now only lead to confusion I am dew-rninned to break sience. It appears to me that an incon ect statement of affairshasbeei laid befora the public of this cLintry, that they do mot knacw what bM occurred snd I tlaiihk I now hold in my hand the means of maling them acquainted with the actual stata of affir As my intention is to convey to the House 'and to tri nation at large a c,rrect t,atement of factd, I hope the House will b IaV wiih use while I attempt, feebly asI knowW it Will be, to pnrlorni that duty. The noble lord, taldnm an illustration fronti the hon. member for the West -1idingQ *aid that we had done all that ma ran of honour.could hawvd eone in the case betveen ourselves and the Adiericans; that we had apologized for that 'which had been t-ken amiss by thesit, that we had expressed our sorrow for having trenched upon tbeir laws and that we had done everything which, as peresoia d,sirous of peace and honourable men, we couldbe called csl up to do. If the facts -were asthe noble lord s tatd I shosld have been the first to snpport; him in his view of the case, but as I believe tIey amrevery different I have coine forward to enlighten the ignorance of the world (if I1 may so express myselfl ("Hear, hear" and a laugh) in this nit'ter-an ignorance fostered by the holding back of :ll t'at mil:tated against England in the drcmnstances-which have occurred. We have been led to suppose that we haive rightonour'side, and that our cousins on the other side of the -ater, taking advantage of our poei. tion, were neverthtless endeavouring to force uS to nike a sort of sulyile*tion tothem for peace. ,Now, wha'c is the state of tlhe ca-e It is this --After the Paliament of Great Britaha had pamsed an act for the enlistment of foreigners, the CGo-.^eroment determined, undei the provi. Eions of thatarto .o eitistpeople in Anerica. Being unable to intercept the einigration flowing from Germany to America, they ventS. t.o America, andathey gave instructions to our authoriti,0. tflure to form a foreign leogon, to be composed of pe<oi-s enilistd in Arrerica. One of the per. Eons employed uj.ni that occasion was our 'Ministsr ab Washington (Atr. Cra.upton), another vwas the Govcrnor oE Nova Scotia, and a third was the ¶overnor-General o£ Canada. Thenobl,v loor said that, as soon as overnment discovered that umbrage had been given to the UniteCI States by the co-as1 se tley had taklen, he gave irnstrutions to our lIinisters and agents not to trench in any way upor the municipal Jaws of America, and at the samne time sent a full apology to the American Government. He then appealed tO the House, and asked-could he do anythingmore? If ile noble lord had only dore what he [stated, I should have answered Mis appeal by saying thab nothing more could be done. But Government did more. and what they did l -will now state. Mr. Cratupton went from Washington to Nova Scotia, and he there entered into a sort of combination with the govemor and laid a plan by which tbe l..s of the United States might be contravened, in ordcr tk obtain surreptitiously that which could not be obtained by other3means. I wil prove directly all that I assert oiit of Mr. Crampton's own mnouth, or rather out of his owni pen, but I ought first to state the law of America upon the subject of enlistment; and thei House will then SCe that it is in accordancewith the opiniors and feeling ofthe ressotry. in the first place, it is illegal to enlist anybody in thle nited States for the servces of a. foreign State. Tshe overnment are not however charged 'with that offeuce, lat with something more. Any per.son going to the United States and inducing people to leave tho.-n States for the purposie of beinjg enlfisted abroad also acts in contravention of the law, anti this is thep art of the law w hich Mr. Cramutonis accused oZ having broken throulL He 'went to Nova Scotia, he there engaged persons go-ing to the States to enlist people-that is, to induce them to go to Nova Scotia to be enlisted. Now, the veryact of inducintg people to leave the United States for the purpose of ldoing enlisted is a violation of the law, being a contravention of that neutrality to which the Americans 'wish to ahiiere. Mr. Crampton thoight he couli do this 'without heilng discovered by the authorities of the United States. They did, however, discover what was taking Dlace, and, in conse( nence of that discovery, Mr. Crampto3L issued a proclamation from N ova Scotia, suggesting a means of evading the lawr of the UIJted States, and giving the par. ties 'whom he employed a cypher by 'which they might communicate with himo. IIow do I prove tbis statexeatU Why,nI holdinmyhanda doeuo,entcurious inmanyways. It is are. priof atrial that took place inPennsylvania, m'which one HenryHert z was the defendant, being ehargedby the Uinited States' Government x ith certain breaches of the law set; forth in the indictinent. One pecularity of the ndicment is that itis intelligible. (A lah) 'ihis Henry Hertz was a man 'who had been employed by Mr. Crampton to crimp people-that is, to induce them to leave the United States nod go to Nova Scotia, for the purpose of being enlisted there and then sent to the Crimea. Now, we are supposed to have made an apology to the United States, and it wvas supposed, too, and atone time sup. posed by 3vself, that the apology was one which the sit'e'd St3te uought to have accepted; but it now appears thateitherMr. Cramptonwent beyondlhis instructions, and, if so, the UJnited States are fully justified in requesting his recall, or his instructions went beyond what the laws of the United Stateswould permit, and in that casetheUlnited State, would be justified in saying that the apology of our Govem.' ment was disingenuous, and could not be admittea and that they still insisted on the recall of Mr. Crampton. Iwill mention a circunstance known to everyone familiar with the history of the United States, that during the revolutionary vars of France, and during the Presidency oE Washington, an envoy from France, Citoyen Genet, went to Anerica, and endeavoured to fit out privateers contraryto the rules of neutrality which the United States, bad laid down. Washington and Jaceson conplained o! this conduct on the part of the citoyen, and they sent to the republican Government of France a requisition for his recalL He was recalled, and the demand of the United States was satisfied. The United States then did by a. friendly Government-the Government of France,-whats they now do by England-namely, they demanded therecall of the man who had broken their laws of neutrality. Now, I want to make it clear that Mr. Crumpton has alo brokem through the laws of the United States, 'which laws he ought to have known ; and if he has broken through thoso laws without the authority of the Government here, the Government of the United States are fally justfied in demanding his recaIL If ho has broken through them by the comnmand of the Governmenthere, then I say that the Government in making their apology have endeavonred to p alm off a deception on this House and the country for which they are resuonsible. Its; appears from the facts elicited in the course of Ihe trisl that one of the witnesses had been authorized by lfr. CramptonL to act as recruiting sergeant in America, and had received from Mr. Crampton a paper which showed the system of, deception practised. The following is the paper:- "Meemoranda for the guidance of those who are to make known to persons in the United States the terms and conditions upon which recruits wll be received into the British. army :--L The parties who may go to Buffalo, Detroit, or Gleveland for this purpose must dearlyunvderstand thatthey must carefully refrain from anythingvhich would constittea violation of the law of the United States. 2. They musts, therefore, avoid any act which might bear the appearance of recruiting within the jurisdiction of the United States for a foreign service, or of hiring or retaining anybody to leave that jurisdiction with the mtent to enlist in the service of a, foreign Bower. 4. There must le no collection, embodimenb. of men, or oranization whatever attempted 'within that jurisdiction. o. No promiises or confsacts,'written or verbal, on the subject of enlistment must be entered int dwith anyP erson 'within that jurisdiction." X.ow, 'what w as the inducement beld out to men to go to Nova Scotia9 Oh I there 'was a raiway there, and in onebreaththey were told to go there to be navvies, and in another they were to go there to receive, according to theproclamation issued, lb dollars on enlistingo, anda certain naafer 'rswhile they served Her Britannic Majesty.. The paper goes on to state:- " The information to be given 'willbe simply that to thosedesiring to enlist in the Britsh army facllities will be. afforded for so doing on their crossing the line into British territory, and the terms offered bythe British Government may be stated as a matter of information only, and not as implying any promise or engagement on thd part of thosfesupplyg such information, so long at least as they remains w. American jurisdiction." Can it be said, I ask, to be in accordance with the dignity of the British Government to publish such a statementas that? As honest men ought 'we so to act? The docament proceeded:- "It is essential to success that no assemblages of persons. should take place at beerhouses or other s;ar places of entertaminment, for the purpose of devising measures for enlistig, and the parties should scrupulously avoid resorting to this or similarmeans of disseminating the desired information, inasmuch as the attention of the American authomities would notfallto be called to such proceedings, which wouild undoubtedly be regarded by them as an attempt to, carry on recraiting for a foreign POower within the lints of the Urited States; and it crtainly must be borne in md that the institution of legal proceedimgs against auy of the parties in question, even if they were to lude the penalty, M ould be fatal to the success of the enlistment itself." I ask whether the sentiments in that statement are consistent with English honour? It appears that the authorities of the United States did take unbrage at the vroceedicgs andwhatthenoccurred? Anotherpaperwas showntotue witness, and this is the evidence Oiven "In whose hand-writing is this paper ?-At that time I also received this cipher to telegraph 'with to r. rsiupton, and to Halifax, about this recraiting business. I cannot swear as to whose handwriting it is in, but I believe it is. lHr. Crampton's. I did not see him Write it, but he handed it to me." Is anythins more required to proe that r. Cramlupton Inew the law, and that he took means to evade it, and that he was abetted therein by the Governor of Nova Scotia and the Governor-General of Caladas? It appears to me that a war between us aid the UnitedStates would be a war between brcthreii the evils of whichwould surpass anything that conldhbe magined We are the only tvro great free nations at the present time, Atni shall it be said that we cannot preserve pa4e between ouri elvest We had been led to believe that it was by ignorance that a breach of the municipal laws of the United States
I THE METROROPOLIT BOARD OF WORKS. Yesterday the members of the Metropolitan Board, of Works met again in the Council-chamber, Guildha3l, for the transaction of busines. The President took the chair -.at 12 o'clock. N EW STRr.M FOR SOUlTHWARK. A deputation from a large public meeting of ratepayers, and from the district board of St. Saviour's, Southwark, headed by Mr. 1I. Sturmy, the vestry clerk, had an interviewr with the board in reference to the construction of a newv street from the High-street, Sonthlwark, to the western part of the borough, which they strongly urged upon the consideratfon of the board as a measure of great public convenience, from the vast incease in the traffic of late years arising from the railway ternmini at London and Waterloo bridges. It was stated in the course of the interviewv that a sum of upwards of 80,0001., principal and interest, accruing from the coal dues, had been set apart for making improveunents in Southwvark, and -which could be appropriated to the construction of the proposed street. lur. "eptVY F AtUIUSON suggested that a memorial ought to have been presented to the board from St. Saviour's, Southwark, on the sabject, ;vith which the board could have dealt in a more satisfactory manmer than with a deputation the attendance of whlich he and other members of the board bad received no previous notice. The P SXNinr stated that the request of the deputation for an interview had been received by him after the agenda paper for the day had been printed and circulated among the members, or it would have appeared on the paper. SALARIEiS AND DE oS OF OICEIiS. Mr. Deputy HARuisox brought up the further report of the commiLttee appointed to consider the salaries and duties of officers, vhich stated that the had n placed themselves in communication with the Bank of London, and had accepted from tho bank, as a more convenient and less expensive isecurity, a transfer of 55,0001. Consols for any funds which the board might lodge in their hands. They also recommended that it should he referred back to them to carryout the proposed arrangement in conjunction with the solicitor to the board. The, committee further reported that, having considered what officers should be apointed for the proper discharge of the duties connected with the engineer's department, they recommended the appointment of three assistaut-engineers, six clerks of works, four engineeer's clerks, and six draughtsmen. They also recommaended that the examination of the contractors' accounts, heretofore perfornmed in the accountant's department, should be transferred to that of the engineer; and that the engineer he authorized to engage for two months the necessary as. sistance for completing copies of the map of London on the five-feet and one-foot scale, showing the sizes and levels of the sewers. They reconmiended that the several assistant-engineers be paid the same amount of salary; that the salay to Se paid to each of the assistant-engineers be 3501. a-year, and that an allowance of 50!. a-year be severally miade to them for travelling expenses; that the remuneration of the clerks of works be respectively 3 guineas a-week; of four of 'the six driughtsmen, 3 gaineas a-week; and of the remaining .two, 2A guineas n-week; that the salaries of the engineer's clerks be 1751. a-year for first clerk, 1501. for the second, and 1001. each for the third and fourth. They recommended likewise the appointment of a principal clerk, and of a second assistant-clerk, to assist tke superintending architect in the discharge of his duties, at salaries, the former of 2001. a-year, and the latter of 1501.^hey alsorecommended that a solicitor be appointed provisionally, on the .suai terms, subject to reconsideration of such terms in tho event of the board being engaged upon works of public improvement, or other works of an extensive character. On the motion'of Mr. Deputy MLumsos, seconded by Mr. WAnRE, the Bank of Londonwaz appointed the treasurer of the Board, on the terms as to security stated in the report of the conimittee, and as offered by the directors of that establishnent. Mlr. Deputy lAratisON then moved that the reconimendation of the committee,- in reference to the engineer's department bo &adopted and carried out. The PREsrDNm-Tr wished to take that opportunity of' sawing that sinbe the discussion on the report of the commnitt~,o relative to the assistant officers in the several departments, at their last maeeting, a general impr-ession prevrailed out of doors that the board would have to advertise for new officers. It was true new officezrs would be required; but hie wrished it also to hin understoodI that the board had a large staff of officers handedl over to them by the late Comnmissioners of Sewers, -and it would be desirable that the board should reelect the 0la officers, so far as they felt that, they could conscientiously -do SO.

ELECTION OFTM ASsISTAN-osnIsats AIM THE SOLICrTOr. On the mnotion of Mr. lsMsvow, it was resolved that the election of the whole of the assistant officers and of the solicitor, mentibhned in the various reports of the Commtittee on the duties and- salaries of officers, be proceeded with in a committee of - the whole board at its meeting on Friday nest. MIr. IRhvSE submitted that the more desirable course would be to leave the election of the subordinate officers to the Presidenthimself. The-PREsEsT said he was desirous thatthe boar should elect such officers as would most efficiently discharge the duties assigned to them. He was confident that when the board elected the whole of those officers they would to him, as his own assistant, the one -whom they thngt the most efficient of the whole staff. (Hear, hear.) CON;SULTING ESGI-EMS. Major LYOS broughtunder the consideration of the meeting, pursuant to notice,,the question of consulting engineers to the board, with a Niew to an early appointment of such engineers. He ,rged as a reason for maing the appointment that when the board agreed upon a scheme for carrying out the interception of the drainage of the metiopolEs, they would have to go before Parliament for the nieans for executing that scheme, and it wrould be desirable that they should go to Parliament with their plans endorsed withthe highe6t possible engineering authority in the country. . Mr. DotLTo.T contended that,the board having appointed achief engineer, there wvas no necessity for them to have recourse to any consulting engineers, and that it -was at aln events premature to pass such a motion at present. (Hear, hear.) MIr. L. T,AYOR suggested that the board shoild refrain from sanctioning the motion until the engineer in chief had laid before them his, pLms for carrng out the intercepting dr.ainage scheme. (Hear, hear.) Mnla P.uxsaru I did not knowi what they wtere going to do wvith consulting engineers when they got them. A n oh. The time might, perhaps, come when they w ould wvant consulting engineers, hut it w;as premature to discuss the matter at present. Mr. D'Irs.a->sm could not understand what they could have to do with consulting engineers, when they had an engineer of their own who had the reputation for great ability and experience in his profession. Theymight as well hare a consulting chairman. Major Lvos said, bowever greatminihtbe the sIld of the engineer.to the board, it ought never to be the policy-of the hoard to go to Parliament with a scheme for the work in question vwithout the s-upport of the highest engineering talent w,hich the country could produce. The motion wvas then pult and negatived. WORKS SN PRO(u5zEqS. On the motion of Mr. B1iSTOw, it was ordered that a concise statement of the several works inprogress under the late Commissioners of Sewers and nowbeingearried on under the sanction of this board be prepared by the clerk and engineer, and printed and circulated among the members of the board twro days at least before the first meeting of the board in Mfarch, and that the plans connected therevith he also in readiness for the inspection of the board at that meeting. RETORT>S OF COluITTSE}S. A motion of Mr. Nicholay for printing the reports of committees of the board was adopteo with some modification, after a lengthened discussion. TRAYFIC OF LoNDoN-BriDrx AN-D SOuT .rx. Mr. COLLINSON, puzsuant to notice, moved, "That, taking into consideration thegreatly increased and daily increasingr amount of traffic over London-bridge, and in Wellinsgton-stre et .an d High-stre et, Southwark;, and also considering that there isa suimof 80,0001. arising from the coal duties set apart for making improvements in Southw;ark, it is most desirable that immediate and active measures be taken to provide for making a new line of street from some part of the High-street, Southarlk. towards the western pat of the district." The hon. member commended his proposition to the board on the ground chiefly of its being a work of absolute publc necessity, consequent upon the innnense augmentation of thle traffic in the thoroughfares mentioned mn it, caused by the rail-ay termini nea-r Wnterloo and London bridges. The motion was seconded by 'Mr. Aim3AR1S. Mr. R. Tkrr.Osi submitted that this question had been prematurely broughtunderthe considerationofthe board, and that as Lasubeth, which be represented, contributed a very considerable proportion of the 84,000?. said to be accumulated for improvements in South;vark from the coal dues, a corresponding part of that sum, or at least about 30,000 of it, ought to be appropriated to the construction of a street in Lambeth, fromn Vauxhall-bi-idge to Westminscterbridge, a work of great public necessity, d to the removal or improvement of some of the most wretched dwelligs of the metropolis which are to be found in parts of Lanbeth. MIr. MmiaS said, many years ago a street, which was very much required, wvas projected by lr. lose, from Stanifordstreet to the 3Brouigh-market, which was supported by the most influential inhabitants inthe districtd and he submitted it would be desirable to have the plans for that street before them before they came to anyresolution on this subject. (Hear, hear). Ar. Cor.7sE, considering that the board 'was not now in a condition to discuss this matter with all the facts before it, moved the previous question, which v ws seconded by Mr. SEELEY. Mr. HALL submitted that they should have something like an adequate idea of the cost of the proposed workbefora sanctioning it, and knowv what iuterior views, if any, the inhabitants of Southwark had in reference to street improvements; for the proposition of Mr. Colinsonmight only be part of an enlarged scheme of Avhich the board had now no nowledge. Mr. COLLINSON explained tbat if his motion were carried, it was his intention to move another, to the effect that the President apply to the Government to know what plans had been propounided by them or to them for street improvements in Southwark, with the view to those plans being brought iunder the consideration of the hoard. The PaYSzFaNnu expressed a hope that the board would enter upon the consideration of the great question of metrotropolitan improvements in a way which would be creditable to themselves and worthy this great city; and tLat, while having due regard to the claims of particular localities, they would discuss the important subject of metropolit&nimprovements in general in a large and liberal spirit. (Hear, hear.) ,lr. Fw said it appeared to be conceded that a large sum of money had been set apart for improvements in South- -ark cc iiovine, but he hardly thought the board was in a position now to deal vith the motion of Mr. Collinson in its integrity. He thought it expedient that, instead of entertainingthemotion at this time, aconuniitteebe appointed to inquire into the actual existence of the money stated to have accrued from the coal dues, and thepurposesfor which it was specially appropriated,- Mr. 1. TAXM n said, uness it corId be shown that the suns in question had accrued to a larger amount than 80,000!., it %was not worth their while to entertain the motion, seeing that such a sum -would be wholly inadequate for carrying out thhe work in question, even if it vere desirable to do so. Ho also contended that that sun of 80,000!. could not be fairly appropriated to improvements in Southwark alone. (A luah.) In p roof of this he cited an act, among others, passed in 1840, for continuing the coal and wine dues for four years longer, from the 5th of July, 1848, the oreamble of -which stated as a reason for that continuation, that it wvas desirable to provide a fund for the making additional thorougifares and improvements iu the metropolis, to be executed under the direction of the |Lord Hih Treasurer or the CommissiLoners of lHerMajesty's Treasury, and more particularly an intended thoroughfare fom Coventhy-street to Long-acre, andanotherfrom Southwvark to WVestminster-bridge. The motion was also opposed' by Mr. DOULTON, Mr. Howe and Mfr. DAvis. Mr. WRIalrr and Mr. SAYAGE were for referring it to a committee. MIr. WriaSSoN and other members suggested its postponement for the present; and after some further discussion, in which Messrs. WArE, TuBXRN, Sr.xLaY, CoCLiasoS, and other members took part the amendnent of Mr. Corrie was carried. - svaoroLrorAr sraoVEi.m Mr. Wzn&Sozs gave notice that he would move, at a subsequentmeetingof the board, "That,i iordertoenable the board to decide what particular improvements in the thoioughfares of the metropolis are most pressing with regard to the publio convenience, the 'superinten'ding architct imsnediately.lepmare and lay before the board a state- ment comprising all the projects for deetropolitantiprove- ments recommended by the M eetropoltan I tirovement Commission rmby' Committees of the Horue 'of Compmonls, and that they ho laid dowm:upon one of file lrgc sized skl;eeton Ordanace maps. 555 sTREET Tioar CEnsASss TO 1'.r s¶r<sus.

LOVDOIY, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 16, 1S85. The House of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock. Lord Ec.m-rou called attention to the dial of the clock tower of the new Houses of Parliament, and asked if all the dials were to be marked with suchl hieroglyphics as the one put up, as in that 'case the public would not be nuch the wiser as to the time of day; he lhoped the figures would be made modern and intelligible, instead of being mnediteval, and muclh the reverse. He had also heard that the towver had been built withouit providiu, the means of raising the clock and bells; the publtc, therefore, were liliely to have a dial that conld not be reatd, a clock that would not go, and bells that coruld not he rung. Earl GRnAviLr;, in reply, read a letter from Mr. BARnr, which is given in our Parliamentary report. Lord BROUoHAx preseiited a petition from Carlisle on the subject of burials inburialgrounds not consecrated. The Bishop of Ex rxER denied that Dissenters had any cause for complaint if the bishop had refuised to consecrate the ground till it shonld be put in a fit condition, according to the laws of the chlurchl, to be coinsecrated, or if a place of sepulture was set apart for those wIho were not members of the church. He had heard with surprise that if a bishop refused to consecrate a burialground any persons fancying themselves aggrieved could applv to the Court of Queeu's Bcnch for a inandamus to compel him. Earl GRv-ANyI thought it would be beyond the law to "ive the SEcnrrkn.v of STrTE power to enforce tXie prayer of the petitioners; at the same time, he thought a discretion ought to be used by the bishops in applying the present law ; and he hoped they wouild not follow the example of a small mninority of the Episcopal Bench, but take a wider views of the question. Uord C.%mraxrPB believed, if it were proved that a burialgrouid was not in a fit state to be consecrated, the Court of Queen's Bench would refuse a -7nandnawrfs. E3arl GR- niE moved the second reading of the Vice-President of the Committee of Council of Education Bill. The Earl of DEBB- doubted if the time had arrived for relieving the comunittee of all responsibility. Lord O2TON EAGLE questioned the efficiency of the Board of Education, as the business supposed to be managed by the ex. officio members was reaUly conducted rby subordinates. He rejoiced that in this case an approach had been made to a better system. The time had arrived for making the responsibilitv of the education of the peoDle more direct, and connecting it more closely with Parliament. Tlle E-arl of ELLE;BOROUGH thought the work now throfsi on the Council of Education was quite enough for one man, and would be done by one man better than by a board. But the duties ought to be separated from political interests. They ought not to be intrusted to a man of extreme opinions, either in politics or religion, or on the subject of education itself. If he held extrene opinions in religion and politics, he would not secure the co-operation of the gentry and clergy of the country; and if his opinons were extreme on education, he would be inclined to sacrifica the labouir of the children of the workini classes, indispensable to their families, to the object of making a literary peasantry. Earl GE agreed with the Earl of ELLrxBORO%GH that a great fault had been committedby theCouncil of Education in requiring too high a standard of literary knowledge in its schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, to the detriment of qualifications of a more practical and useful kind. He approved the duties of the board being transferred to one individual; but for some years they had very inconsiderately increased the number of Parliamentary -offices; nmany ew offlces had been created, while the old ones had been retained, though no duties wsere attached to them. In this respect the whole systemi required revision. Lord BnouGLsrm expressed his satisfaction with the measure, and rejoiced that there was at last a prospect of having a real Department of Education in this country. The IM arquis of L,%isDow.N-E and Earl Gsuirvrmv. defended the principle of making the office of Vice?resident one identified with the Ministry. Tne bill wvas then read a second time. The Rou§e of Commons Offices Bill was read a second time. The Metropolitan Police Bill was read a second time, after a short discsszion, Lord C£ =EaLL sug-estiL- tlie insertion of a clause taking from the &ecretoay of State the power of removing police magistrates at pleasure. Lord PRi3rNE laid on the table two letters, addressel to him by the Earl of CAF.DiGoN- and Lord LacN-, in reference to the report of the Government Commission of Inquiry in the Crimea, and moved tlmat they be printed. The House then adjourned. In thil House of Commonig, on the order for going into a Committee of Supply, Mr. Rommtac callce the attention of the House to our relations with the UInited States of America, prenil-ing tlat Iis only intention was to convey to the IT1use- and the nation a correct statement of facts. hord PALIanMSTON, he observed, had told tho House that the British Government had done all that it was incumbent upon an honourable man to do; but he (Mr. RoEnucx) believed that the real state of tlhiing3 was very.difterent.. Vith reference to the enlistment question, the noblo Iord -had said that when the Government discovered that its agents had exceeded their instructions, a full apology had been sent; but he wrould showf, Mtr. R0BCIu said, that more had b~een done than the noble lord had given the House reason to suppose. }Havinc, ex-. plausled the American lawv upon the subjoct, ho insisteA that tha.t law- had been contravenled. Either MIr. CRANiPTON, our M1nister at Washington, had exceeded his instrnctions-and if so the United States' -Government -were justified in demanding. his recal-or ' his instructions went beyond what the law of the 'United States permitted, and in that caso the apology was disingenuous, and oughlt not to be accepted by the Amercan Government, wshich haa a right to insist upon the recal of our Minister. It appeared, ho said, from published facts that MIr. C,uaxrrON knewv the law; that he took Ineans to evade it; and that he had been supported by the Governor of Nova Scotia and the Governor-General of Canada. He wvanted, he said, distinctly to know wshat w;ere Nfr. CnrroNxs instructions; he vanted an explanation of the facts, and 31n expression of sympathy on the part of the House towards our brethren across the Atlantic. He moved an address for a copy of the instructions to MIr. COAin-rox. The moiion was seconded by Mr. HADiED. Lord PAi_r.risToNx said the American Government had not thought fit to lay before Congress the correspondence relative to this question, and the' reas6ns wlich had induced them to withhold it had led Him MAssRw'i4 Government to pursue the same course. He had before stated that just previous to the meeting of Parliament a long despatch had.beerr received from the United States' Government, containing a great variety of statemenits and assertions touching the conduct of our Minister at Washington and our Consuls in the United States, to which it was impossible to reply without a reference to the parties concerned,; that until that despatch was answered the Governmlent could not lay the correspondence before Parliament; and for that reason he had declined to enter upon a discussion of the subject. This state of things still continued; the mater.als had not been received that would enable the Government to reply to the despatch wvhiclh demanded the recal of our MIinister; and the same reason which made it his duty to withhold the correspondence obliged him to resist this motion. He trusted, however, that a short timeo only would elapse before he should be able to lay the whole of the papers before Parliament. He could not, therefore, followv Mr. Roxuucn through the details illtO whichl he had'entered; all he should state was, that it had been the desireand the instruction of the Government, from the outset, that nothing sliould be done that waat t variance with the laws of the United States. Thiring the course of these tr,anisactions repeated offers had been made to HvE0iL JESTY'S officers, the sole object of which was to entrap them into a violation of the municipal law ; a conspiracy had been got up for this pur- not (as Lord P,uamrusTo.; afterwards distinctly declared) on the part of the American Government. The despatci referred to asserted that there had been a continuance of the proceedings after they had becni said to be coiuntermanded; if so, it was against the intention and without the knowledge of the British Government, w hich, on revoking the orders, had oxpressed its regret that anything should have happened contrary to the intention of our Governmuent to give offence to that of the United States, and this apology was received by the American MIinister at this Court with the expression of an opinion that it would be deemed satisfactory by his Government. Mr. Rosexuc knew (Lord PAL,rstsTox observed) that this question was pending between the two Governments; that a very short period must elapse before a final answer would be given ; that this was a subject deeply interesting to the feelings of two great nations which should not be trifled with; and yet he rushed with impatience into a question of so much delicacy, which could only be settled by a dispassionate discussion, in order to deliver himself of statements founded upon a brief given by antagonists of his own Government,-ma'kinghimself the mouthpiece of calumnlies uttered in the United States,ealing upon the HEouse to pronounco an opinion up on a question, of the facts of which it was utterly ignorant. Mt: Dis R said, although he could not support the miotion, lie protested against the principle laid down by Lord PA}.aERsTox for the conduct of members of that House with respect to foreign transactions and negotiations with foreign Governments. He had alwvays considered it to be the first duty of a member of Parliament to call its attention to w hat he thought improper management, and to asl for explanation ; and a Minister of the Crtowx had no right to tabint an indeftedenet member nrith holding a brief froi the enemy. He responded to the hope expressed by Mr. Rorxsucr that there should be an expression on the part of that House that woulcd assure the subjects of the United States' Government that this question would be discuissed without prejudice, and that the House would not willingly defer to rumours in either country that these questions were pretexts only for a misunderstanding which, if exasperated, might have the most calamifous results. He hoped MEr. RoEsx would not persist in hlis motion. The motioni was negatived. ' MA-r. W. WNI'3Uars, being prevented by the forms of the House from moving the amendment of which he had given notice, that the Revenue Departments Estimates be referred to a Select Committee, stated various reasons which induced him to propose this course. A short discussion followed, confined to MIr. WrSox, Sir H. WmatouGEy, and the CHANcErLoa. of the ExcniQrER, who affirmed that no part of the expenditure would bear a more seatching and even hostile investigation than that of the different classes of the revenue. The Honse then went into a Committee of Supply upon those estimates, vwhich were voted, after discussion, and the resolutions were ordered to be reported. The CmINCEIOp. of the ExcrrEQumt, in nmoving for leave to -bring in a bill to amend the act relatine to the superannuation of the Civil Service, remarked that the existing system had given rise to extensive complaints and dissatisfaction on the part of the civil servants, which ought to be fairly considered. He proceeded to describe the nature of the system, which was of comparatively recent origin, though nothing, he thought, could be more shortsighted and impolitic than to have a Civil Service without a system of superannuation for those members wvho were disabled from performing their duty. He detailed the provisions of various acts modifingi the original Superannuation Fund, the act of 18%, embsodying a Treasury Minute of 1829,-wfhich created a fund from deductions from saLaries,-being the law up6n the subject now inforce. He then considered the specific complaints of the civil servants, and the points to which their objections mainly applied. 'The principal objection 'was, he said, that there had been a breach of faith on the part of the Government, and an illegal application of the fund obtained by deductions from salaries. This allegation. he distinctly denied, and he stated particulars respecting the disposal of the fund to showv that there had been no departure from the terms of the act, and that there was no ground fur the charge of breach of faith. The profit supposed to be obtained by theC-overnment from dealingvith the fund lie treated as imaginary, contending that, takiunv the most sanguin e view of the amount of the deductions, it was not likely to cover the probable expenditure. He reviered and replied to other objectiors, one of whiclh, however, founded upon the combir.ed operation of the income-tax and the deductions, he admitted to be werelfounded. In consider- ing the course proper to b'e taken in this matter, he thoght that inconstancy a;nd va-cillation on such a subject was highly objectionable; he did not, therefore, propose to rescind the act of 1S3, but his mecasure was limited to aIterations in the scale of supernnuation allowa2nces, so as tomake them more libJeral, accomiianied by other changes beneficial to thecivil servants; beyond this he did not propose to go. If the bill was read a second time, he proposed to refer it to a Select oommittee, with power to examiine witnesses. After some remarks by 1Mr. RiCn adverse to concessions to the Civil Service, Mlr. T)I$Aii:i said, as the bill was to be referred to a Selct Comniittee-a course wlich he approved -it was inexpedient' to disc"s- the details of the proposed measure. Bu1t lie svas a little disappointed, he adai'd, to ii:.ind thfat this wvas to be the greatest measur.e of administrative reform to be introduced by the Government, which was not fulfllling the promise made last year, by virtue ofv which they were saved from a defeat in thatHouseL Sir F. BAUING thought there were points in this question which were fair subjects of inquiry. He was sure it would be a great advantage to have the whole subject discussed in comnmittb3, and he cautioned the House against being led away by what they heard respecting it. Some brief observations having been nade by Mr. RonBucx and Sir S. Nen0TrCOTE, Sir J. GaAHAN said, having been one oI the individuals who introduced the act of 1834, he was a living witness as to a merasure which had been termed one of spoliation. The only part of it which, in his opinion, required consideration was that connected with the pressure of tho income-tax, combined with the deductions, and, althouigh ready to give a calm and even indulgent consideration to tle claims of the civil servants, before he agreed tk the second reading.of this bill he was anxious to look into the details. Mr. M. CHAMBERS made a few remarks, and leave was given to introduce the bill. Mr. J. FERGUSON moved for leave to bring in a bill to appropriate the income of such-one of the canonries of the Cathedral Church of Carlisle as shaU next fall vacant to the augmentation of certain ecclesiastical incumbencies in that city. Mr. R. PrLmiornv said the principle of this bill was of great importance; it applied to every canonry in the kingdom, the income of wlicih might be similarly appropriated. MIr. LIDDmE likemise opposed the motion. The motion was supported by Air. ]INaor and Mr. LAsLErr. Mr. GLADsnoaE thought it would be too strong a course to prevent the introduction of the bill,'to the principle of which, with due limitation, he was not unfavourable. After a few words from Mr. XiNnAncD, leave was given to bring in the bill. Mr. J. D. Firzoj ID and MIr. WniSoN obtained leave to bring in bills, and the House adjourned at 20 minutes to 12 o'clock until Monday.
It has often been observed that thero is nothing in nature so timorous or excitable as the moneymarket. Was ever young lady so nervous or old lady so apt to be surprised as the personage usually describedcasthe capitalist? Give him every opportunity of braeing his nerves for the eccasion, and let him know the outside of the danger, he is yet as much horrified at its actual appearance as a child at the maskv whch it has not only seen twenty times, but itself put on. Was it possible to doubt that the CHANCELLOR of tho EXCHEQuER wanted a good deal more money? Last year he had to borrow more than twenty millions, inc.luiing the addition to the floating debt, and, as we have already incurred all the expenses of another year's war, it was a matter of certainty that we must borrow as much this year as last. Accordingly, in our remarks on the accounts for the past year -we intimated that he would probably waut twenty miillions-a very moderate (stimLate, we believe. The first year of a peace is always more expensive than any year of the previous war, and not all the book-keeping in the world will prevent the presentation of bill after bill long after peace has been proclainied, armies withdlrawn, and fleets dismnantled. It is trtue that if the British public were willinlg to pay the income-tax and a few other war taLxes for four or five years longer, we could even now get on wvithout any further addition to our permanent debt; that is, supposing peace to be made, and no other war beguln for tlhe present. But it would not be safe to confide so much iu the patriotism of the taxpayer. The ordinary thing, under existing circumstances, is to fund the floating debt as fast as it ceases to float, so as always to keep it above par. Weo can hardly doubt this process will require twenty millions this year. Only last week, indeed, }X. WVrSoX, in reply to a question from Sir H. WVnLLouonGBB, stated that the financiavl puUMitixt Ur t o <C.m - X 6 render unnecessary on the part of the CncNicEuon of the ExcHEQukn any financial state-ment or demand for money until the votes for the ensuing year had been taken. But it is a remarkable circuumstance that no Chancellor of the Exchequer ever has the least idea he will have to borrow so much as a paltry million till the very hour when he sends his broker into the market to borrow ten or fifteen millions, as the case may be. So long as the Christian public are willing to shut their eyes and believe what he says, it answers his purpose to make statements of this assuring and aMgreeable claracter. A momenfs consideration, however, would show anybody endowed with the gift of reason that the sum we have mentioned would be wanted this year, and must be borrowed at one part of the year or another. Nevertheless, no sooner was it announecd yesterday that the CHANcxaron of the E;xoREQuEn was prepared to receive tenders for a loan, and offers for funding a portion of tho outstanding Exchequer-bills, than Consols fell near 2 per cent., and there was almost as much panic as if it had suddenly transpired that the Conference for peace had broken up wvithout result. It can only be a question of time; the money must be had; and it cannot much signify to the public whether the CRA.CNor. of the ExCoEQuEr. takes his twenty millions all in a lump now, or in July, or half now, and half then, or spreads it over the year. Common sense seeras to say the earlier the better, for the expenditure still goes on, and, while our hands are in, it is better to see England for once thoroughly armed. There are those hundred and fifty gunboats to be finished, and those floating batteries, those monster mortars, and mountains of shell. But the mere expenses of winding up the war will be something considerable. We have to bring home more than fifty thousand men, besides the largest quantity of materials of war ever carried so far. There are all kinds of contracts and purchases, both here and in the East, to be paid for, and liabilities to be redeemed in behalf of our allies. Nor is it to be expected that we can establish the Turkish empire and the Danubian Principalities in their new position vithout some expense. It is a very old remark that a rich mal pays not simply according to the value of the purchase, but all the more in respect of his own wealth; and if a wealthy nation like England cheoses to come forward as the champion of independence, and the succourer of the o,ppressed all over the world, she must expect to pay handsomely for the honour. In the last year of the Last war, or rather in the first year of the peace, there was a clearing loan to the amount of thirtyseven millions, if we remember right, and very fortunate should we count ourselves if we come off with borrowing- no more this year than about- half that figure. This, with war taxes for a year or two, will probably bring up the expenses of this war to something under a hundred millions-a sum which may seem rather large compared with the value of Turkey, but which should rather be regarded as the price we pay for our ovn honour and the security of all Europe. Nor is it to be forgotten that such is the speculative character of our race, and so certain are we to throw money-away when we find ourselves possessed of it, that but for this war, we should by this time have been deep in new railvays and other manias. Some of the millions spent on this war would certainly have gone in useless works at home, and to loans abroad, with as little prospect of reimbursement as we now have from the soil of the Crimea. It will be observed, by reference to our city intelligence, that Consols, vwhich had left of very heavily on Thursday, opened yesterday at a fall, which is sufficiently accounted for by the fact of scme sales of stock at the opening of the market. This suggested a suspicion that some I:owledge of the forthconming announcement had been allowed to transpire; but on an in-; quiry being instituted before the Conunittee of the Stock-Exchange, no 'foundation could be found for tho suspicion. This result, of course, proves nothing, as, if tlhere had been any leakage, and it had been acted upon, the possessors of the secret would be very clumsy indeed if they did not manage to put a good face on the transaction. Leakage is an evil which we hold it wholly impossible to prevent in the case of Ministetial intentions, where many persons must bo more ior less cognizant of them. After all, it can signify little wlhether Consols fall all at once or gradually in the course of the day. But it-does d.serve somo consideration whether it is consistent with tho common principles of morality, and whether it befits one of HIn MAmEsTr's advisers to go on to the last moment declaring that there is no want of nioney. In this case there seems a positive impropriety, for nothirig can be easier than to let the matter alone, and say nothing at all, even to the most pressing and impertinent interrogatory. Such a courso only concentrates on one day the fall that might otheroise be diffused over months, if, indeed, there were any necessity for a considerable fall. 'It seems to us desirable that the public should be kept as well informed as possible as to the expenses of a war and the probable demands of the Treasury. In that case there could not be much* fluctuation, and there could be no ground whatever for the disagireable suspicions felt yesterday on the Stock-Exchange. It vould, too, be a very good example to set to oiur mercanWie classes, addicted, as they are, to conceal their transactions, even, if it 'were possible, fiom their own eyes.
Young men in Turkey are entitled to speak of the vanished past, to rejoice over or deplore changoes vith aUl the gravity of elders. No small part of the diplomatic and consiular bodies remember the days when Enropeans could only traverse Stamboul under the protection of a Janissary, and thousands of armed Pretorians would assemble in an hour at the beat of an inverted kettle, ready for tumult or rebellion. The introduction of French costume and Prussian science is wvithin the recollection of many whlo are even nowr only considered as risiig men. The first hotel is but a few years bld, and now hotel-keepers abound, skilful in all the nnholy traditions of their craft. But the commencement of this war will be hereafter remembered as the era from wlhich a new age will be reckoned. Diuring two years the armies of the Western Powers have passed up the Dardanilles in almost unbroken stream. The iirst effect was to thirow back the Turks into even more than tlheir former seclusion. The more their chief men were brought into necessary and official connexion witlh Europeans, the more they shrank from even their former limited social communication. But necessity is stronger than tradition or pridc. Az each act of the great drama was evolved it becamo more certain that Turkey, with its old isolation, its old supremacy of race and creed, its old imperial us-ages, could no longer exist. The Turk has never shown want of perception in affairs of State ; formerly he ruled by the sword; wlhen that became impossible, ho ruled almost as effectually, as far as mere order was concerned, by obstinate adherence to a settled policy. Now that a great convulsion has broken up this old world he, in appearance, frauldy accepts other aid. entirely new institutions. The Western Powers wvent to war to preserve the SULTAX'S territories ffrom the CzAR: the latter potentate had made Clhristian wrongs a pretext for interference; France -a -s-a >< l r-oo-a tv 1- iisuselves redressers of those wrongs, and an understanding with his allies bound the SuLTtw to grant, with as* little delay as possible, relief from the hardships said to be suffered. The SuLTAN has, in the most public maimer, and with every circumstance which indicates design, told his subjects that the old constitution of his State has ceased to exist. For several days the Ambassadors of the great Powers had debated w%ith the Turkish Ministers on that Fiourth Point vhich is to regulate the future of the empire. On the 29th of January a council was held at the British Embassy, and prolonged far into the night. The result was the acceptance by the POBTE of all that the Ambassadors had asked, and far more than they expected. The SLTmvNx gave next day his final assent. Lord STIrArronnD DE REDOLIFFF then invited him, as a public proof of respect for his allies and of fidelity to the principles then established, to be present at a fancy ball to be given at the Embassy on the succeeding day. How far the SuLTAN was aware of the unwonted sight prepared for himn we cainot say ; but he accepted the invitation, to the astonishment of the Perote world, and, doubtless, to the scandal of the more orthodox among his countrymen. But the Turks of Constantinople are now used to change, and perhaps are not displeased that so high an example will justify tlhem in tasting miore freely pleasures from ;which they have been debarred. The SULTAN came, saw-uay, stood up to see. VWaltzes, polkas, young ladies in ball dresses-all were beheld by the COGtMANDER of the FkiTHFuL. The SULTAN is accustomed to eat alone, but he took refreslunent even hi; the presence of the other sex. To touch. a subject was a condescension rarely vouchsafed, but here he walked down stairs holding the hand of a Giaour and a Frank Turks and Rayalis were witnesses of the novel spectacle. When Count Ro:BmT leaped on the throne of ALExxs CoalmEXus there could not have been greater consternation than in the minds of a fewv old servitors of the PaDasaHA on that.l eventful evening a fortnight since. When it is considered what prejudices of creed and education must have been overcome by the SuLTAN, what actual danger incurred from fanati^'sm or threatened ascendancy, what trials he has passed through, what doubts must have beset him as a Monarch whose rights are,legally uncontrollable, but Whose capital is occupied by foreign troops, we may well give our admiration and applause to his ready entrance into so bold a course. ADDUL BM&DJI has been throughout this I war ever ready to meet his alies according to their own usages, however foreign to the habits which he had formed during a life of seclusion. Two years ago he had never visited a human being, except two or three Pashas connected with his family by marriage. Even then the interview, though perhaps only for half an hour, was conducted with formalities whichyrendered it onerous and its repetition undesirable. But on the arival of the armies in the Bosphorus heat once forowent this isolating dignity. He visited Plince NsroTuoN and the Duke of CAIEBRIn6GE at their several residences, and in turn invited them to banquetsat the Imperial Palace of Tcheragan. On their return from the Crimea the SuLTrA repeated his visits to the two Princes at the Embassies of their respectivenations. He honoured Lord RAGLAN, Marshal ST.. AnNAuD, and General Sr. JEa" V'Aimmy by being present at revews of the British and French armies. Now, at the eonclusion of negotiations which affect the social state of the empire, he extends his courtesy to the representative of one of his- allies, and sanctions by his ipresence the usages of that new eivilization which tis to change, if it cannot regenerate his people. WVell advised by one or two counsellors whose mur:pe6n expe- rience taught them what was fitting, and actiug according to the dictates of an understanding naturally good, ABDUDI MEDxn has within two years gradmiluy abafidoned an that characterized an Eastern Sovereign in his intercourse with strangers. From this time forth we. may expect that he wil follow the usages of Western potentates, and, indeed, that much of the etiquette which reigns in Western Europe wiM be disregarded in the capital which has been for ages the stronghold of formalities. But we must Tegard a more important p-oi-tt Is the stability of the new order of. thing.s to be hoped for? Has old Turkey indeed passed away in its prejudices, or, at least, its power of acting in accordance -with them ? Are intolerance and oppression indeed dead and buried? Time will show. All that we can say is that those Turks wvho hold the highest place in their own country are convinced that a deluge has overwhelmed the old world, and that it is necessary to think and act for a totally different state of things. Snch are said to,be tlhe sentiments of the Turkish Envoy to the Conferences; such is the langage of Stamboul in general: there are those who rejoice and those who lament, but all equally acquiesce. 1But we must be content to curry slowly into practice that which has been adopted in principle. Constantinople and the cities of the coast must first witness the reign of equal rights, honest policy, and sensible law. When these objects have been gained, when the relations of the Great Powers to their ally are settled, when the repression of Russia has taught every class neither to hope nor fear her interference, then we believe that justice and civilization wrill soon radiate from the capital to the mnost distant provinces of the empire.
The debates on our Statute Law, its present state and futtue prospects, recur with a frequency and an earnestness which, if we had not been too often deceived to be ever sangaine on such a subject, would really lead us to suppose that the work projected by BAcox, anid sighed after in vain since his tine by so many generous and enlightened spilits, is at last about to be accomplished. Twaice in a single weekl has the House of Commons listened for hours to discussions on those most repulsive words, " digestion," "consolidation," " codifica" tion," and thoughlt its time profitably employed. Sir Firoy KELzy brings before the House a bill to consolidate the law of offences against the person, and is about to bring in another embracing the whole subject of bills of exchange. W&ho are the drudging Cyclops that forged these thimderbolts? From what subterranean work-shop they are nshered to the liglt of day by the hands of Sir Friznov KrELLY we cannot, of course, divine; but the factory has not stopped, for we are informed by the learned and enthusiastic knight that he has plenty mnore of the same article, and will feed us with this legal manna as long as we have appetite or digestion to receive it. The Statute Commission should look well after so formidable a rival, and that, too, one of its own members, whose fertility of production and amplitude of exposition bid fair to leave behind him all competitors, and to digest our Statute Law while others are engaged in masticating the first tough and unwieldymorsel. Nevertheless, we rise from a perusal of the debate on the introduction of Sir Frrziov yKELLY's bill with a conviction that there is great danger lest the task which has been delayed for so many years will at length be entered on too hastily and inconsiderately, and that great waste of labour and consequent disappointment will be the first result of isolated, and unconnected efforts. WVhat is wanted is not so much a compendious -view of any single or any number of single titles of the law as a clear and compendious siurvey of the lawconsidered as a W1nolO.. *xne great desideratimin is an arrangemient which shall make sure that when the worlk of consolidation once begins no labour will be thrown away, and no compiler will have to go over the work already undertaken and completed by another hand. Sir FiTzFoy KELLYS own plan affords an instance of the very fault to which we allude. Hie consolidates the law of offences against the person and bills of exchange. To what common principle of subdivision can these two classes be referred? The one seems to belong to a division of the law such as the readers of our digests are faniliar with, foumded on technical definitions and legal terminology; the other seems to aim at a higher principle of classification, resting on human nature itself and those complicated relations that make up society. These discordant principles may work well enough as long as they are kept separated and distinguished from each other, but so soon as the number of consolidated acts become considerable it would be apparent that we started on a false division, and that the matter gathered under so many different heads, referable to different systems of division, must be redigested and reconsidered. For this reason we are disposed to thinkl that isolated efforts at consolidation, involving, as they do, no commanding and pelrvading principle, are a waste of time and labour, and had better be suspended till the general principle of action be finally agreed upon and determined. The principle npon which the Statute Law ought to be divided need not rest on any profound metaphysical or legal truth-need not embody the result of any lofty abstraction or comprehensive generalization. All 11at we have to require of it is that it should be exhauistive-that it should so divide the law into parts as that within one portion no fragment of any other portion slhould be contained. This once effected, the real difflculty of the task is overcome. The workl so divided can be parcelled out among a number of experienced and able men, and pursued simultaneously under the direction of a single head until the whole labour is aecomplished. It is strange that the division of labour, which is so thoroughly understood and so uniformly practised in mianufactures, should be- entirely overlooked and disregarded in these, which may fairly be caUed the manufactures of the mind. The division of labour does not only mean that one man should do one thing and another man another, but that these different means should each be subordinated to one end and correlative. If it takes 16 men, each working with reference to the other, and all labouring with a single view, to make a pin, does it not appear unreasonable to suppose that by any number of isolated efforts such a heroic work can be effeAed as the consolidation of the cumabrous and chaotic Statute Law of this country? It came into existence as the result of some 17,000 isolated efforts of human will. If it is to be brought into order and coherence, it must be not by any nLumber of individual efforts, but by ono mnethodical, systematic, sustained, and combited exertion. As little as it has been possible for private enterprise to give to this country a well-arranged system of railways, so little will desultory and individual enterprise obtain for us a complete consolidation of the Statute Lavw. It is our ordinary practice to work first and plan afterwards, and this does well 'enough for single enterprises; but, if we aspire to anything greater, we must be content to trace the outline that we are to fill up, and divide to every man the work that he is to do. The indispensable requisite, then, to a consolidation of the statutes is that we should devise some exhautive principle of divisiort by which our Iabours may be economized and directed; but, in order to do tbis, we cannot but thitn it iould be necessary clearly to ascertain and carefully to discriminate the subject-matter with which wo have to deaL The statute-book contains, as we shoved on a former occasion,. an enormo-is mass of private, local and personal, tobsolete, expired, repealed, and partially repealed acts, ivwhich obscure our view and impede the jus- tice of our conclusions. WYe mnst clear -awaythe rubbish before we can ascertain the ground. plan and elevation of the edifice. In order that we may divide we must distinguish, and in order that we may distinguish we must fuUly and completely comprchend. For these xeaaons, without at all pretending to deny the force of anything that was said in the late debate, we take the liberty of acding to it our suggestion of the absolute necessity that, as before we begin to codify we should consolidate, before we begin to consolidate we should divide, so before we divide we should carefully clear awL ay and expurgate. These are the four steps by which our present disgracefully neglected law maybe reduced into a clear and beautiful system ; and -we feel firly convinced that to invert the orderto seek to raise the fist story without the founda-a tion, the second without the first, ori the third without the second-is only to accumulate disaDpointment aud vexation, and to defer the accomplishnent of an end that cannot be gained except by labour systematically and nmethodically applied.
There was a very long discussion on Thursday nlight in the House of Commons on the subject of the Irish Judges, upon which we would offer a very few remarks. Sir J. V. SYlEriyn moved for a return relating to the age and infirmities of the Judges of the Superior Courts of Law in Ireland. It appears that among these judges at the present moment are Chief-Justice LEFrsoy, aged 82; Judge Toun=s, aged841; and BaronPx-sFATnrxR, aged 85. Baron rzNrFATnER is blind. The question is, whether men of this age can discharge the duties of a judge. Let us for the moment confine oiurselves to the case of Baron PzENNEFATHIER, aged 85, and blind. Can it be supposed that an aged gentleman, afflicted with such an infirmity, is in a situation tD try a case of aiiy importance? How can he markthe demoanrour of the witnesses? How can he take notes of the evidence? Ifow can he, without notes, charge the jury? Nobody for a moment denies that Daron PP-N-2Fa?ATHER has in his time been a mosu distinguished lawyer and an excellent public svrvant-but, alas ! he is not free from the ordinary iinfirmities of humanity; he has lo3t the use of his sight. There is nothing more tobe said. It -was btut four or five years ago that as excellent a lawyer as ever sat upon the English bench-Mr. Justice PArrSON, hadthe 3nisfortuneto losehishearing ; and what was his conduct ? He resigned. Now, l!r. Justice PATrTsoN at the date of his resignation possessed the full use of his faculties-he was not so far advanced in years that the full vigour of his fine intellect could be supposed in any degree to be impaired; but he resigned as a matter of duty. Since then he has been most usefully occupied for the public service uipon affairs which could be treated without injury by a person in his condition. It is our wish and our intention to mention the name of Mr. Justice PATTrEsoN -witl all respect, for he deserves honourable mention ih the history of his times. When the same measure is applied to the Bench on the other side of St. George's Channel as we are in the habit of using in our own ease, one would suppose that some blasphemy had been committed. Since the days when Mr. JoHz O'Co-NXLL threatened to die on the floor of the Rouse there has never been a more unseemly exhdibition than that made by llr_ NArPT;Rz an i + Pt Nf +h. T,4.1 T-. Mr. {&irE3n, for his part, woild entirely refuse anly participation in these dignities-rnay, if possessed of therm, he would dash the insigni4 of his office in the face of somebody if anybody should presume that, at the age of 85, being stone blind, he was not fit to travel circuit. " I mnust cc say," remarked Lord PA=tsToN -with regard to IMr. NAXprmrs speech, " there was a good " deal of very good indignation thrown away." That is just all that is to be said about the matter. Mr. NAPkpiEs speech, under the circumstances of the ease, was a perfect farce, and. Sir JOE2e SBzzLxa 's motion a highly proper one, no matter to what division of the empire it had applied. The country does not grudge retiring pensions to its old and faithful servants; there is nothing so dear as II unjust justice" in Ireland or elsewhere.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES OFFICE, fturdayMorning. THE PEACE CONFERENCES. (Br SzRAM-X A" 8B1SarTrrsE n We har received the following telegraphic de. patc2h from our Paris correspondent "PAS, SATURD&y, FEB. 1, 8 A.M. "Count avour, the Sardinian Plenipotentiary to the Conferences, arrived at Paris yesterday, accorupanied by a secretary and two attaches. "He alighted at the Hotel du Rhin, Place Vendlme." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. Much agitation was produced to-day on the Paria Bourse, indeed it might be called a panic, in consequence of the telegraphaunouncingthatConrols had faUlen 2 per cent. The effect here was severely felt at first, but the funds rallied afterwards. Various reports, some of them absurd, were in circulation for a good part of the day. The complete rupture with the United Stater, the delivery of his passports to MlL. Crampton, the departure of MIr. Buchanan from London, disturbances in some large towns in England, the fall of the Ministry, the conversion of s large amount of Exchequer Bills into Three per Cents., were the principal reasonsassigned by public rmmour for the fall. The alarm at first occasioned by the Bourse quotations diminished as the evening sIdvanced, Of politicaluews of importance there is not much. Ve arestill anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Plenipotentiatries. Baron Brunow has already seen sorne of his friends, political as well as personal. iTliough rtill uncommunicative, he is reported to have said that Russia is sincerely desirous of peae ; but that if peace be not made without loss of time, if all be not over within three weeks or a month from the opening of the Conferences, serious difficulties might interfere with the final settlement of the question. Russian diplomatists generally try to gain timne; the mode is changed, and I suppose we shall endeavour to satisfy their new taste for expeditious business. We read in the Cmstfieiornd " We have receivedauthentic information which enables usl to afrnn that the opening of the Conferences for the reestablishment of peace remainsfixed for the 23d inst. A private letter from Brussels has the following observations on the present state of affairs:- " It is indisputable that the political condition of Europe requires to be changed and restored from time to time liLe everything else human. Unfortunately these changes and reitoration, which invariably affect the interests of some one, can be rarely brought about without war. For this reason those who are really political menlose no time in imparting to it, from the moment of its commnencement, the most suitable direction, in order to modify the map of Europe so as to ensure a general equilibrium; while the timid and incapable, on the contrary, who only make lvar out of vanity, or as it were forced or constrained to it, merely aspire to returning to the saeLs quo ante bellunz, just zs you irn France seem desirous of doing at this moment. But I seriously put it to you-Will the equilibrium of Etrope be better secured after the peace than before Vie war? Will the 'Colossus' of Russia be less formidable? It is evident that those matters, of which the 5th Axticle of the conditions accepted by Russia will have to support all the responsibility, will impose a heavy task on the Plenipotentiaries, and that if they be examined in this point of viewv peace ia far from being concluded. "It must not be forgotten that all that diplomacy strives tv ,L, -. L o.nuefonti ,ada t: tbh futur (e : will have for its object to detach Turkey from the Western :liance. Russiawil now do her best to reconcile herself with that Power, to obtain her neutrality, if nothing more, and the closing of the Dardanelles, so as to guarantee her southern frontiers, which, as you are awvare, are the most o posed, and the defence of which, in spite of all our faults, hasrendered necessarysuch immense efforts. Europe will lose in that her greatest offensive force. "Events have once more proved how little Germany is able to defend herself, and to what degree of apathy nations once so warlike have reached. " Our great anmiety now appears to he to give satisfaction to the Christian subjects of the Porte, who are our mortal enemies. By acting too hastily, too imprudently, in this r&pect, we alienate the Mussulmans, who have proved themselves our loyal and brave allies; and we completely forget the Slavonic people, tho Magyars, and Roamains, who groan under the oppressive yoke of Austria. The Pols, Use Italians, the Serbs, the Hungarians, the Bohemians, who compose three-fourths of the Austrian Empire, and who turn their eyes to us, will now throw themselves into Panslavism. They will do it aU the more wilicgIy that the Poles of the Russian provinces, abandoned now for the twentieth time, loudly announce that they will at lht adhere to Russia. "These reflections are not dictated out of any spirit of hatred to Germany. No! I am too well aware that when Germnany is conquered, France will not long resist; and that rasnce annihilated, the tonm of others will then corne. My wish is to see Germany strong, and that she should be so, an Austrian Empire founded on a sincere fusion of aU the provinces, and not on the ambition of Gernamni.ing people wha resist such a tendency. Austria would gain bath internalIy and externally by withdrawing herself from the D)iet. from which Russia ought also tobeexcluded. Unions esLablished by Confederations are only good when the weakness of States renders them indispensable, and while a certabn equality exists between the members. It will not be sufficient to exclude from them the great States; we must decide on mediatizing a score or so of smaUer States. " It will not even suffice to place Turkey out of the question, to afford a certain degree of security to Sweden by a declaration of neutrality of the Aland Isles, to require the re-establishment of the Poland of 1815, in order to make the Rusian arnils that occupy the centre of Europe fall jack. We must above all occupy ourselves with Germany. Austia must be put out of the Germanic Confederation, in order that she may become less German and more herself, and tlat she shall, in imitation of the Sultan, think snore of her subjects. That Confederation ought to be reorg-anized in a stronger manner, and composed only of six or seven States exclusively German, vhich shall -absorb the others, i nd in which the majority shall be binding on the minority. Ewitzerland should also be joined to it. "Thre partisans of peace are overjoyed, it seems, on learn. iug that the Emperor Alexander at length desires the terruination of the war, in order to occupy hinself with the internal improvement of his empire. But there is one fact v latch should open their eyes, namely, that tlhe very warlike GrandDukeConstantinepartakestheopinionsof hishrotherin -hio respect. It is then evidentthat the said internal improveanents musthave for their object, not commerce and industry, not the emancipation of the serfs, nor any of the liberal chauges which are on foot now in the Ottoman Empire, "ut rather new works for the fabrication of improved zincs, and especially of railroads, which will permit P.ussia fo transport troops fromonepoint to another of her vast territory and her :coast, much quicker and snore safely than jwe can transport ours by our fleets. This isnot a gratuitous seupposition. abshort time beforethe var propositirns were nude to a French capitalist for the construction of a rail- ad which wav intended to connect Sebastopol with lSt. l'eterhburg; Ha4 that line been completed it would iave readered I f6iNl our attacks, and our armies landed intheCrim"sn qd`d i eight days After, have been driven Into the wke-q 'iiis.ten times theirnumber." Thle fIJQwabg letter has been received from Constantinople, tinde; fte the 4th inst. "'The presence of the Sultan at the fancy ball given on lnursdy ndght-at the English Embassy was a remarkabIe event It is looked upon as preliminary to a complete re-. o'utioe; in the etiquette observed hitherto at the palace of cher3gpa, Which, for soInC time past, tenids to the adoption f tlIe Images observed in Western Courts. The English hasador presented Lady Stratford and his daughters to ho Sultan, and . de Prokesels piesented Mademoiselle rokescs. His Highness conversed for some time with 31. hvenedE1, and also with Lord Stratford and other mem- ra of the diplomatic corps. When Lord Stratford knew or certain that the Sultan would attend the ball, he injited WebnetnAli Fasba, the Minister of Marine, the presence t£he Sovereign givizg to thofie a sort of official character 9ide the Sultan wasim his apartments he sent forMehemet All Pasia and Lord Stratford, and when the three reippead in the saloons where the comapany was assembled kr appeered to conTers very amnicably. It was 1lso re- rk0d that Red-chid Pasha conversed for some time, and apparently in a very friendly mauner, with Mrustaph, Pa3ha. It was not known that a reconciliation bad tUken place the sameday between those twoStatesnion. The Snltan retired at half-past 10 o'clock, and X salute of artiUery snnounced that His Majesty bad entered his palace. " The impression produced by the presence of the Sultan at the ball on the population of Pera was quite as great as at Stamboul. It was regarded with pleasure by the better classes, and produced no nnfavourable effect among the lower. " The nomination of Aali Pasha as Plenipotentiary to Paris has been very well received. He is very favourably remembered at Vienna, and won the esteem of the members of the Conferences, which, I am certain, he will not lose at Paris. " M. Thouvenel was summoned on Saturday bythe Sultan to his Hiosk, at Tophane. The interview lasted for some time, and it is conjectured related to the changes whvich .have taken place as to those which are t6 take place. Yesterday all the Ministers, with the exception of Fnad Pasha, remained a long time in Council at the Palace of Tcheragan. To-day there is more calm; but it is supposed that this evening or to-morrow all these negotiations wil be resumed with renewed activity. Redschid Pasha has hai several conferences with hL Thouvenel, and it is generally believed that he will soon be in the Government. Yesterday, the First Chamberlain of the Sultan paid a visit in his master's name to Redschid Pasha. Aali Pasha leaves on Monday; Ariff Bey and Djetal Bey accompany himl as Secretaries. " The mail from the Crimea received to-day bringi very little news. The docks are totally destroyed, with the exception of a great wall which the English axe engaged in blowving up. The French are preparing to blow up Fort St. Nicholas and the magnificent barracks which are capable of containing three regiments; at this moment that fine fortress can only be a mass of ruins. 1S gans have been taken out of it, which are sent to Kamiesch; it is said they are destined as an ornament for the Boulevard de Sebastopol in Paris. "It is rumoured here that 5,000 English troops are about to return to London, and that preparations are making for their embarcation." The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- BE'MDT, FEn. 14. "Count Orloff, who left St. Petersburg last Sunday, arrived here this evening, and sets off to-morrow for Paris. " The advices from St. Petersburg lead to the idea of important changes in the Administration. The resignation of the Minister of the Interior, as well as of the Mfinister of Police, is spoken of. M. de Bludoff has arrived here from Hanover. "A report is current that the reserve of the Russian Guard will be sent to their homes.

"The reports which have circulated relative to attempts at disorder, to a Ministerial crisis, and to differences in the Caibinet, are without foundation." A Council of Ministers was held yesterday morning at the Tuileries, at which the Emperor presided. M r- 'n---, ^ lwai .lAnerals St. Jean d'A-ngely, M6llinet, and Rolin, and Colonels Ney, Valabregue, and Lepic, reviewied the regimont of the gendarmerie of the Inperial Guard yesterday forenoon in the court of the Tuileries. His M3ajesty passed along the ranks and distributed several crosses. The troops afterwards filed off before His Majesty with loud cries of "V ive VEnPIereltr." His Mlajesty left Paris yesterday, about 1 o'clock, in an open cariage, to shoot in the forest of St. Germain. Baron de Brunow was present at the Grand Opera on Wednesday night to witness the representation of the Corsaire. Count de Piper, Aide-de-Camp to the Kidng of Sweden, arrived at Saumur on Sunday last, charged by his Goveranent to order 1,000 cavalry saddles Vithl holsters. The Count visited the riding school on M1onday morning, was present at the exercises in horsemanship, and at a review which was given in his honour. He left on Monday evening, after expressing to General Count de Rochefort how much he hadbeen gratified by his visit. The formidable defensive works in couTse of construction at Portsmouth have excited the surprise of some of the Paris journals, and the AssenWde Nfationale thus expresses itself:- "If even the approaching conclusion of a peace is not quite assured, it m-a- be demanded in the face of what danger these works are being constrmeted. Assuredly the Russian squadron now buried in the harbour of Sebastopol wasnevera-menaAetotbeBritish coast,andthetworemainming Russian squadrons which still Jloat at Cronstadt and Helsingfors, have shown that their ambition wisely consists in defence and not in attack. A war between England and the United States-a war which is by no means probable, notwithstanding the passing difficulties of the momentwould in no case expose the powerful squadron of Great Britain to be braved in their ports boy the American navy. It is in vain that we search for the enemy against whom it is now a question of defending Portsmouth." The receipts of the Orleans Railway during the week ending on the 4th inst. were 869,571f., or 132,152f. more than during the correponding week of 1855. The gross receipts since the 1st of January amouanted to 4,188,521f., being a difference in favour of 1856 of 533,889f. It appears from the return of the Bank of France that the metallic reserve has increased during the past month 13,605,350f. in Paris, and 1,161,117f. in the branch banks. The discount accommodation has decreased in Paris 8,725,357f., and increased in the departments 1,824,890f.

BERLIN, FEB. 14. The text of the communication which Austria made to the Diet this' day last week has been published; the last sentence of it contains the pith of the matter, and runs as follows:- " As a member of the German Confederation the Impeial Court hopes this august assembly will take occasion from this communication to proclaim to Europe, that the whole of Germany, in conjunction with Austria, accepts and is willing to mnaintain, these bases, on which a general peace is to be firmly and durably erected in the coming negotiations." From the extremely tame and unpersuasive tone of the document one is almost led to the supposition that the Austrian Cabinet can have had no hopes of iuccess, in which case they will have saved themselves a disappointment. Annexed to the document itself are copies of the despatch entmsted to Count Esterhazy by the Austrian Government, and dated December 16; also Count Nesselrode's note to Count Esterhazy, dated January 16, accepting the proposals. A copy of the protocol of February 1, embodying the acknowledgment by the Western Powers of Russia's having accepted the Austrian proposals, is also added. From the document itself we learn thatAustria "urgently recommended the acceptance in St. Petersburgof the Austrian proposals," and that " Ehis Majesty the Emperor of Russia, for the purpose of restoring to his empire and the world the blessings of peace, decided to accede entirely to the proposal of Austria." There is every imaginable variety of statement to be found in the German press as to the conclusion that the Diet is said to have already arrived at on the subject of the Austrian communication; but the only authentic information on the subject is, I believe, that it has not come to any conclusion at all, unlessto- day'ssitting should haveproaucea something unexpected. There seems to be a desire among the German States to overcome the objection of Austria to a special representation of the Bund by proposing that it shall be represented by Prussia. This proposal, however, is equelly unacceptable to both of tlhe two rival States; Austria wiU not have Prassia represent Germany in contradistinction from Austria, and Prussia will accept no admission to the Conferences that is procured for her by Austria. The latter has been very active in her ondeavours to procure Prussia's admission to the Paris Conferences, for the purpose of showing to the world that slie has all Germany at her back; but the Western Powers, or at any rate England, have decided against her admission, in which the latter acquiesces rather than enter into any military obligation previous to entering them; but though she acquiesces in the result it will not be forgotten here what a part England has played towards her throughout the business. If Prussia be subsequently invited to take part in any negotiations it will be known that she is indebted to the conciliatory spirit of the French Government for the compliment, and not to England. The impression seems to obtain here that the result of the deliberations of the Diet will be the adoption of the Four Points that Russia has already accepted, but that the Bund will reserve to itself every freedom of decision as regards the in-I distinct fifth one. Count Orloff, whQ is expected to arrive in Paris next Saturday, and was consequently expected to arrive here to-day, will probably not reach here till the day after to-morrow (Saturday), as he only left St. Petersburg last Monday. Count Esterhazy left here the day before yesterday for the purpose of meeting Couiwt Buol at Dresden on his way to Paris. I The Princess of Pruissia and her daughter left here to-day for Weimar, and the entire Court will remove from Berlin to Charlottenburg next Monday. From the Jounial de St. Petersbostrg we see that nt71niFtprharin iS -Petersbura was only admitted to an audience of the Emperor on the 6th inst., the very day of the nuptials of the Grand Duke Constantine, although he arrived at St. Petersburg as far back as the last week of December. TEE GERMAN DIET. The following is the text of the declaration presented to the German Diet at Frankfort by Austria on the 7th February " Conformably to the orders of his Court, the Imperial I Envoy, President of the Diet, has the honour to lay before the High Assembly copies of a despatch addressed by the Imperial Cabinet, under date of 16th December last, to the Austrian Envoy at St. Petersburg, Count Esterhazy; and of a document from Count Nesselrode, Chancellor of Russia, dated 16th January, and addressed to Count Esterhazy. " The High Diet will be convinced by these documents that the Imperia Court, after coming to an understanding with the Governments of France and England on the preliminaries of a peace, which the three above-mentionedPowers deemed conformable to the object of their alliance and to the general interest of Europe, seriously recommended the acceptance of those conditions by the Coufrt of St. Petersburg, and that His MIajesty the Emperor of Russia actuated by the desire to restore to the world and to his empirethe blessings of peace, resolved to adhere without reserve to the Austrian propositions. "The Imperial Envoy has moreover received the order to present a copy of a protocol, signed at Vienna onthe 1st Febrnary, enregistering that the representatives of Austria, France, Great Britain, Russia7 and Turkey have paraphed the text of the above-mentioned preliminaries, and that at the same timie they notified the intention of their Courts to nominate plenipotentiaries to meet at Pans within three weeks at latest, to proceed to the formal conclusion of a preliminary convention, to the negotiation of an armistice, and to thc opening of definitive negotiations of peace. "It is a lively satisfaction for the Emperor Francis Joseph to have it in his power to express, in the midst of the Governments of Germany, the hope that the moment is not far off when the unhappy complications of the last few years are about to receive a pacific solution. His Majesty is convinced beforehand that the high confederates will fully share his sentiments. If a guarantee in this respect were necessary, the fact woul sauffice for the Imperial Court that the Government of His Majesty the Kinu of Prussia, the august friend and aUly of the Emparor, has emp7oyed all his influence to bring Russia to a conciliating decision, and that the lauguaze which the other Courts of Germany employed at St. Petersburg contributed towards the same end. " Hailed with joy in every part of Europe, the retum of peace-let the Imperial Government bh allowed to put faith in it-will be welcomed with particular satisfaction by the Hi_h Diet, in consideration of the import.nce which the conditions destined to form the tenour of the treaty of peace will have for the political and commercial interests of the whole of Germany. " Those conditions are essentiallythe same as those already approved by the Confederation in general, by previous resolutions and which it declared itswish to adopt more par. ticularly, andto maintain the two frst in the point of view of German interests. If the bases for the maintenance of which the Confederation thus pronounced itself have now received a more complete developement, the Cabinets of Vienna, Paris, and London, whose deliberations could cnly produce a programme of a moderate peace, had a double object in view, to prevent in the most efficacious manler the return of the disastrous troubles, which the world now desires to see terminate, and, by a sufficiently precise draft of the pselimina- ries, to make sure of a stronger guarantee for the re-eta. blishment of adefinitive agreement. The high Government of the Confederation wil recognize that the guarantee; wnich the future peace must bring wil not be the le33 precious, especially for Germany, by the development given to these points. "On the other hand, they wiU not disown that the said Powers, faithful to the principles, the coUective recognition of which constitutes the bond of their alliance, have conscientiouly excluded any proposition which would not be fully justified by an incontestable European right, and 'which, for that very reason, would not be of a nature to bh accepted with honour by each of the great Powers which divide between them. in the first rank, tho responsibility of peace and of the prosperity of Europe. *" The Imperial Court entertains the firm conviction that this spirit of moderation and solicitude for the general welfare of nations will also prevail at the Conferences which will shortly open, and that, consequently, the right expressly reserved in the fifth point for the belligerent Powers to propose, in addition to the four points of guarantee, new conditions in a European interest, will not be exercised in a sense which might have the efrect of again compromising the work of peace so happily commenced. " As a member of the tIonfederation, the Imperial Court 7opes thattho High Assesubly il see in the present communication a motive for declaring before Europe, that the whole of Germany, united with Austria, accepts, and is resolved to uaintain, tho bases upon which the approaching Cc nfurences are to erect and cousolidat general peace." ITALY. The Piemonte of Turin, of the 13th inst., announces that General della Marmora had put off his departure for the Crniea until the 20th. On the 12th, the Chamber of Deputies voted, without any opposition or discussion, the estimates required for the army and the expedition to the East, the different items of which were-Military intendance, -900,000 livres; military supplies, 707,000; pay of* the troops, 9,350,000; sanitary service, 1,990,000 ; stores, merchandise, waggons, 6,768,000 ; freight andc transports, 7,036,000; remounting, 3,519,000; bread and provisions, 20,067,000; forage, 6,000,000; fuel and barrack expenses, 869,000; service of the artillery, 2,368,000; service of the engineering department, 2,223,000; technical service of the staff, 18,000 sundry expenses, 370,000; other expenses, 488,000. -Total, 62,813,000 livres. We read in the Opinione Count Cavour, who is goirg to take part in the peace conferences at Pans, possesses all the talent necessary to accomplish with -success the delicate and arduous mission confided to him. The whole of Italy, as well as Piedmont, vill have their eyes fixed upon him, being conscious that he will vindicate their rights and warily plead the caus of Italian independence. Sardinia is the oily Italian State represented in the Paris Congress, where it camnot be expected that her enemy, Austria, will defend Italian interests. IL Cavour will consequently have to defend those interests as well as those of Piedmont. Al the advantages that can he obtained for Piedmont wil likewise prove advantages for Italy, and the refonm secured to the other Italian States wil also be a blessing for Piedmont. Count Cavour must bear in mind, in those solemn debates, that he is the representative of all Italy." The Opi2sio7ie is not of opinion that the sittings ox the Sarilinian Parliament should be suspended during the absence of Count Cavour. That journal recommends the Chamber to despatch as much business as possible whilst M. Cavour remains in Paris, so as t9, be able, on his return, to devote its entire attention to financial questions. SPAJN. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDxP5T.) MADRID, Fm;. IL The troops were put under arms last night, and some other military precautions taken by the authorities, who had received information that some sergeants of one of the regiments in garrison here had been tampered with, and that an attempt wo0uld be made to get up a disturbance, which was originaUy intended to come off on the last day of the CarnivaL Whatever foundation there was for such information nothing actually took place, and the night passed off quietly. A ratheruneasy feeling prevails however, as if the present state of things had small chance of permanency, and the entento cordiale between the most important members of the Cabinet isnotoonsidered as avery solid one. The total amount of the floating debt on the 1st of January was 585,435,888 reals, and on the 1st of this month 631,441,612 reals, the increase being owing to the arrangements made for payment of the last [dividends. The rate of interest paid to private firms for the transactions effected in January ranged from 7i to 9 per cent., and that paid to the Bank of San Fernando was 8 per cent. Theadvantag,e to the State of capitalising thle floating debt at 40 to 45, which, with stability in the Government, might perhaps be done, is obvious, but it does not appear that there is as much confidence on the part of capitalistain SenorSanta Crux as there was inSenor Bruil. S'h-ila v .onoral p- 3-oio plaoo, omad thlgs remain quiet here, it seems natural that the funds should rise to a price which may enable the M:inister to effect the conversion of the floating debt at a type which Will not only effect a permanient saving but will free him from the dependence he now labours under, and must do so as loDg as the Treasury is liable to be caUed on for payment at the end of every month of a large amount of bills which it is at the option of their holders to renew or not, while the consent of the latter may perhaps be refused from political causes, or only obtained by the continuance of a system of usury. It is reported that the recent fall and present depression of the funds is partially owing to some Three per Cent. stock -which had been given by the C overnmient as a guarantee for some engagements having been brought ilnto the market. There was a reaction to-day, the Three per Cents. being done at 38 15 to 38, and the Deferred ditto at 24. ELE,CTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (mosm ot onz coRnsssroxDENTs.)

BUSSIA. I (ROm OUR BERLDT CORRFSOlDEN-. BERU1, F.m. i3. One of the most striking evidences of the pacific turn taken of late by theRussian press is afforded by the Northern Bee of February 1, containing a long article devoted to foreign commerce, and more especially to the construction of railways in Russia, as a means to the development of the former. Among the lines the Court joural considers most important and pressing for immediate construction are-i, the Ine from Moscow, by way of Toula, Orel, Koursk, Kharkoff, Pultowa, and Krementschug, to Odesa (this line has been already decided on by the Government, and the necessary surveys are about to be made); 2, a branchlinefrom Moscow to Saratow (on the Wolga) ; and 3, another branch line from Orel to Witebisk, by way of Smoi.. lensk. The construction of this latter would open up the corn countries in the south-eastern governments of Orel, &c., and convey their produce to the Baltic at the port of Riga, " which Cobden has so justly in DTe Times ealled the ' Hamburg of Russia ;'" for the Nortlern Dee lays it down as an .niudibeusable condition of the concession of this line to be made to any company that it should undertake to make the Duna (Dwina) navigable, both up and down the stream, and also dredge out the Dnieper and make it navigable from Smolensk to Rogatschew. Further, a communication would be opened with the Black Sea by means of the railroad from Moscow to Odessa, and with the Caspian Sea by way of the Moscow Xailroad to Saratow. in all cases the liver navigation is calculated upon as ancillary to this railway ramification; the Dwina, the Dnieper, the OLa, and the Wolga are all to be made serviceable in the bearing of rich burdens of grain either from one part of the empire to another, or from the empire of Russia to the States of the famishing West. Without for the present thinkiing of foreign commerce, it appears that neighbouring governments in Russia itself are badly enough in want of means of communication; in Mohilew, Sinolensk, Witebsk, Pskow, and others near them, dearth is said to be the normal state, while in others, Tamboff, for instance, there is a superfluity of grain. In the latter the price is 15 copecks, in the former 18 silver roubles. But where is help to come from, in the way of capital and skill,'to build these railroads? For the present the eyes of Rtussia are directed for the gratification of these desires to the friendly United States of America; but whenever peace has been concluded we may be sure that English and French capital will be as welcome there as German skill has ever been. It would, however, be well for our country- I men to reflect, if in future they will not allow private interest to take the lead of public duty, that no want was felt so much in Russia at the beginning of this war as that of railroads; that the above pln, on even a more extended scale, was formed two years back, and only not carried out from want of men and money; and that if we have found it difficult enough to beat 31ussia under the present circumstances, it will be ten times as difficult whenever the railroad communication of the empire is complete. The latest dates we have from St. Petersburg, the 6th inst., only bring us to the morning of the day on which the Grand Duke Constantine wasto espouse the orthodox: Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrowna, ci-deva?t Protestant Princess Alexandrina of Oldenbur,. Five guns fired at 10 o'clock on that forenoon are to announce to St. Petersburg that the auspiciou s day was come. All the high dignitaries of State were to repair to the Winter Palace by 8 o'clock in the evening; this late hourhas, it appears, been chosen in consequence of the unsatisfactory state of the Empress Mother's health, which admits of her exerting herself only in the after part of the day; one account I have seen even speaks of her state of health as one calculated to cause great anxiety in those attached to her. She is reported to be convinced that she will not live over the 2d of March, the anniversary of the death of the late Einperor Nicholas. She wiU not accompany the Imperial party to the marriage ceremony in the chapel of the Palace. After supper is over, at which all the healths mentioned in the programme are to be drunk, and all the various si1voes of artillery to be fired as prescribed, the Grand Duke Constantine and his consort are to conduct the newly-married couple to their chlambers, where the ladies of the Court Will be in waiting to receive and undress the bride. On the following day there is to be a soleni office of thanksgiving, celebrated, and on the day after that the nouveaurn marz's receive the congratulationls of the Court. During the two latter days the bells of St. Petersburg are tobe almost incessantly sounded -a species of tintinnabulation thatis not effected by ringing as with us, but by striking on the bels with a hammer according to musical notes. The expectation of peace, of -course, excites very different feelings in different classes; of only two can the sentimnents be predicated with any certainty. The commercial classes desire the retaurn of peace; the military profession de[sires the continuation of the war. The nobility jappear to be divided between those whom the pecuniary sacrifices have already disgusted with the war and those whose patriotic sentinents make them disgu sted with the terms proposed for peace. Iri a private letter I find the following observation attributed to the Emperor Alexander,-."I can't wage a war with a foreign enemy; I hiave enough to do with the enemy at home. This is understood of the corruption, incapacity, and thorough worthlessness of the whole system of interior Government administration. WVe find that the Russiaw Government is about to commence reforms ill national education, in the administration Qof jmtoo in Seliae; the issue of variout petty official certificates, sucLh a passports for travelling in -the interior, is an. nounced to have been all the way along gratuitous, and the aborniks had never any riiit to take any money from the public for procuring them, &c. The institution of serfdom, notwithstanding all the Paris-mada correspondence from St. Petersburg, is the only abuse to which, as it would appear, the axe is not to be laid; not only has the retention of a1 its privileges been lately re-assured to the nobility (among the most prized of which is the right of possessing land and souls), but tho Emperor is now taking evesy measure to facilitate the entrance of the nobility into the 8ervice of the State, of which it has the monopoly; the various attests and certificates of noble birth, genealogical trees, copies of coats of arms, &cO, necessary for proving the nobility of an aspirant for office used formerly to cost unreasonably highsums, and theLithuanian nobilityappewg,above all, to have been exposed to the most uncntrolled extortion on the part of the Heralds' College. The Minister of Justice, Nikita Panin, has, therdore, at the command of the Emperor, prepared an ubase establishing the form in which copies of coats of arms and documents are to be prepared for this purpose on parchment, and fixed a scale of remuneration for the draughtsman and caligraph, and also of the fees payable to the heralds. On one field of reform, however, the Government has been obliged to make a sudden halt, after takdng afirst step; it had empowered the JProfessor of Military History at the Military Academy in St. Petersburg to deliveroa set of lectures onthe late Crimean campaigns, and furnished him with a variety of official information for the purpose. The professor addressed himself to his task with free and candid criticism; but at the end of the first lecture it was found that the events were still too recent, and the prominent persons were sti too influential in public affairs, for a candid criticism to be without danger.

Lord Pammure has tbis day received a deapatce and its enclosure, of which the following are copies, addressed to his Lordship by General Sir Willian Codrington, KC.lB.- READ-QUARTERS, SEBASTOPOI,i FEs. 2. "My Lord,-The destruction of the docks of Sebastopol is now completed; the sides of the last dock were blown in yesterday morning, small parts of the wall here and there only remaining. Thus the whole of the canal of entrance and north docks in charge of the French, the basin in our mutual charge, and the south docks in English charge are separate but shapeless masses of dirt ; heavy broken stones, split beams of timber, and shattered gates protruding from the heap of confusion. " The labour of destruction has been difficult; these fine works were formed in the miiddle ravine at its outlet in an inner and sheltered part of the harbour, one of the natural watercourses from the plateau on which we are encamped. This end of the ravine, about 700 yards from its mouth, seems to have been filled in so as to create a great artificial dam of earth, which, with the steep banks on each side, form three sides of a raised enclosure looldng down upon the docks. A solid stone wall, much strack by shot, crowns this sort of natural square ; the fine but shattered barracks standing still higher on the left, -with the sheds and doc}kyard buildings, the miasting sheers, and a long quay to Fort Paul in front jutting into the harbour, show how well adapted all was for its purpose. It is now a picture of destruction, desolation, and silence; there lies against the quay the half sunken hull of a vessel, and inthe harbour beyond the only things breaking the surface of the water are the lower masts of sunken ships of -war. " The drainage of the -water of the middle ravine must, however, pass through to the harbour somewhere, and it was this that so much impeded the shafts; for the -water from rains often stood two feet high over the floor of the docks, and thus of course flled the shafts themselves. Some details of the execution of these are given in the enclosed sunmary from Colonel Lloyd, Commanding the Royal Engineers, the inmmediate executive officers being Colonel Gordon and Major Nicholson. "A Amid great difficulties of cold and wet, very severe frost at one time, and perpetually recurring pressure at another, the work went steadily on; and great praise is due to all those concerned-the Engineers and Sappers, parties of the Royal Artillery, the 18th Regiment, anld latterly of the 48th Regiment. These parties return to their duty tomorrow after constant and laborious work. "The casualties have been but six, of which two only have been fatal, and one man of the 4Sth Regiment was lost by foul air in a shaft; after several vain attempts by MEajor Nicholson, other offlcers, and men-themselves descending at great risk-the poor fellow's body -was broht up, bt life was gone. "Your Lordship will see that Colonel Lloyd expresses his obligation to MIr. Deane and the chief engineer of Her MIajesty's ship Royal Albert for their assistance. " The voltaic battery, we must confess, did not always succeed ; it seems to require great nicety in preparation; but in those cases in which I saw it succeed the effect was perfect-ignition and its result, the shake of the ground, the heaving up of the mass seemed to be instantaneous. "The destraction of other things will continue. "C I have, &c., "W. J. CODRINGTON, General Commanding. "The Lord Pamnure, &c." (Enclosure.) "1ead-quarters, Camp, Sebastopol, Feb. L "Sir,-After a period of three months unceasing labour in the dockyard, for the destrction of the docks, in com. planca with Lord Eanmuro's orders, it affords me very great satisfaction to report, for your Excelleny's infornatica, the termination of our excrtions in the demolition of tI-at portion allotted to the English, which consied of the three docks onthe south side, and one half of the east ima west sides of the basin.

3lsTous DEATH Nmii BATi.-Mr. Thomas SpiUler, librarian of the Bath Athencum, left that institution on the evening of the 7th of January, stating that he was about to go to the neighbouring suburb of Twiverton. forthe purpose of receiving some money. He never returned to his home, and it was not till Friday lat that his body was discovered near the miUhead of the Swinford copperworks, about a mile below the Salford station of the Great Western 1lailw.y. The face of the deceased, when lifted from the water, presented a shocking appearance, being brniced and distended, while the front of his shirt was found to have been to=n away, and his necktie was gone. There was no money of any kind about his person. An inquest was commenced on Saturday at the Old Swan, Swinford, before Mr. W. Gaisford, one of the coroners for Glocestershire, which was continued on Monday and concluded yesterday (Wednesday). The evidence adduced on Saturday merely related to the finding of the body, and its identification as that of Mr. SpiUer. On 3fonday-, hr. Henry Lloyd, superintendent of the Bath citywrelghingengine, and an intimate friend of the deceased, dewesed to havingseen Mr. Spilleralive on the eveniagof the 7tfi ult., when he stated that he was going to Tw.iverton to receive 100l. At that time he wore in his shirt three silver studs, linked togethervwith a small silver chain. His health was robust; he was in his usual spirits, which were buoyant, and was perfecly sober. Albert Stock, a lad in the employ of the deceased as clerk atthe Athen eum, con. firmed the evidence of Mr. Iloyd, as to Mr. Spiller's leaving the Athenmum on the evening of the 7th ult., for the purpose (as he said) of going to Twiverton to collect some cash, and also as to his being in his usual health and spirits. He had some money in his pocket at the time, as shortly before he left he took out a long leather e, which he g rally carned, and paid the witness 6s. For his wages. B James W'inLams, secretary of the Athearcum, saw the deceased on the evening of the 7th, when he appeared to be in his usual health and spirits, and banded over his monthly balance to the treasurer, which had been since ascertained to'be correct. Dr. T. Barrett detailed the result of a.poet mnoren eeamination of the body, and gave it as his opinion that death was caused by drow,ning. There w;as, however, a large contusion immediately over the forehead, with a corresponding effusion of blood on the brain, which he believed had been receivedduriglife. The effect of such an injury would have been to render the deceased insensible, and could not have resulted from the body coming in contact with anything in the water. A blow that would have produced such an injury would have made the deceased sufficiently in6ensible for his pockets toberansacked before he wasthrown into the water. At the resumed inquiry on Wednesday evening, M1r. E. X. Harris, solicitor, attended to watch the proceedings on behalf of the family of the deceasI ever witnesses were examined who saw the deceased on the evening of the 7th uIt. oing to and at Twiverton, as well as returnine from that uilage. The latest time spoken to as the deceasea having been seen alive was about half-past 9. Matilda Spiler, widow of the deceased, deposed, that on the moming of the 7th her hus. bLnd, accordmng to his custom, counted his money before leaving home. He had then about 30 sovereigns, besides silver, and a pocket-hook and quantity of papers, which he carried in his coat pocket. Witness had not observed any change in her husband's manner; they lived ha pily together, no persons more so, and he was a very lar, temperate man. The coroner, in summing up, suggested that, with respect to the money and papers which were said to be Iaissin the body might have been found and robbed after deatbh use the sum stated to have been in the possession of the deeeased -was more than the reward that had been offered. All the evidence went conclusively to show that the deceased, when last seen, had no intention to destroy himself. If, therefore, he died by drowning (about which there could be no question), it must have resulted either from accident or from the violent act of some other person. How the blow over the forehead was inflicted was undoubtedly a mystery. As it was proved to have been received before death, he thought the jury would be obliged to come tothe conclusion that the deceased was subjected to violence prior to death, and that the act of placing himn in the water was the act of others and not his own. The room was cleared about half-past n o'iock and the jury, after a consultation of about three-quarters of an hour, returned a verdict of "Wilfulmurder against some peron or persons unknown." The coroner expressed his entire concurrence with the finding. It may be added, that the deceased, in addition to his office of librarian at the 3ath Athennum, was a clerk in the Bath branch of the Sun Fire and Life-office, and corresonding secretarf' oftheBath District of Odd Fellows. His life was insured m theEconomic-office for 2001.

LORDS LUCAN AND CARDIGAN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI11S. Sir,-Having laid before the Secretary of State for War a statemeit in reply to the allegations made against me in the report of the Comnission to the crimea, and which will be made public, it will be unnecessary, and, indeed, impossible, for me to answer all the calumnies of anonymous writers; but to the letter of "A Civilian," which occupies a conspicuous place in your journal of to-day, I will give the following replies:- BrIghade no power to move 'the LightCavalry such an order must have come through the jieutenant-General of the Division from the Commander-in-Chief of the army. 2. I attended the camp daily with sccely any exception, and sometimes twice a-day. 3. It w3s no part of my duty to visit the sentries by night or day; they were only the usual camp sentries, and ou,ght to be visited by the orderly offi cer. If they had been videttes at the outposts, and there woere none at that time from the Light Cavalry Brigade, they would have been visited by the fieldofficer of the d;y. 4. When a friend of mine brought out a yacht which I had lent to him Lord Raglan recommended and sanctioned my sleeping on board it. This was a sufficient authority for me to do so, and to feel confident that there was nothing improper in the measure. 5. There is no correspondence in existence which cani in the slightest degreA re9eet upon me. 6. With regard to other groundless insinuations, I do not consider it necessary to notice them. I am. Sir. your obedient servant. CARDIGAN. 1ortman-square, Feb. 15. TO TEE FDiToIt OF TIE TInES. Sir,-Lord Phan=ure having undertaken to lay the enclosed letter on the table of the House of Lords this day, I amcnabled to give it to you for publication, should you consider it deserving of a place in your. columns, and for which I ihall feel obg.I have the honour to be, Sir, Your very obedient servant. LUCAN. Hanover.square, Feb. 15. "tHanover-square, Feb. 7. "My Lord,-Late last evening onlyIhad thnecportunity of reading the report of the Commission of Inquiry in the Last. I consider that I have much cause of complaint. The Commissioners have allowed themselves to offer opinions which, if founded on fact, must tell to the disadvantage of the cavalry, as also to my own, their commander. In one place the Commissioners state that the mortality of horses from sickaess in the cavalry exceeded that of the transport animals, which is notoriously Inconsistent with fact. In another place it is inferred, and without foundation, that there was tardiness in the construction of stables, and that the cavahy only commenced their construction at the end of January or beginning of February, and only terufinated in the middle of March; when, on the contrary, they commenced early in December, so soon as Lord Raglan could be prevailed upon to move them from the heights before Sebastopol to a permanent camp; and, instead of only completing in the middle of March, the 8SO horses, of which the cavalry then consisted, were every one of them stabled on the 11th of February; and, so far from there having been many disposable hands for this work, and that so small a proportion of the regiments was employed in transport and carriage of sick, as it is alleged, I am prepared to show by nominal returns of men that every disposable man was put to constructing stables, but that on many days in many regiments not one man, in consequence of other duties, was available. I made it the first duty of my Deputy-Assistant-Quartermaster-General to report daily upon the progress made in this hutting. I constantly visited the different camps myself; and, not altogether satisfied, as I fancied, with the energy displayed by some regiments of the Light Brigade, Imade them report to me daily the work of the day before. I venture to observe that it wa mnost creditable to the cavalry that, Against every difficulty and obstruction, they succeeded in stabling all their horses, when in the French army at the same time, whatever may have since happened, not one horse was under cover. Again, these Commissioners have not scrupled to charge the Lieutenant-General with deterring officers from proposing to stable their horses in conseqaence of the manner, as they state, with which I received a proposal from the officer com.mnding the Scots Greys. Now, my Lord, I have no personal knowledge of these Commissioners, but T think it not only due to myself, but, perhaps, to others, to show how these gentlemen have, in my case at least, allowed themselves hastily to form and unscrupulously to promulgate opinions, if at nal founded, most prejudicial to professional eharacter, without giving themselves an opportunity, either by the cross-examining a witness or by a reference to the party accused, of eliciting the truth. Sir John M'Neill is not justified in casting imputations upon me without giving me an opportunity of justification or defence. Hlad he felt disposed to do me justice, he might have asked for my examination or have referred to me for information; and I ,annot withhold that, through his omission to do either, lie has inflicted a wrong where, in the discharge of a public duty, he should have shown a spirit of equity and justice. Now, my Lord, to satisfy your Lordship that I have cause to feel hurt, and for some indignanation, I must, at the risk of extending this letter, give the facts in the case of Colonel Griffiths as they occurred. Subsequent to the storm of the 14th of November Colonel Griffiths, when visiting me, as field officer of the day of the division, to report upon the outposts, spokse to me in a complaining tone of the sufferings of his men and horses. I was at that time, and had been many days previous, in daily communication with Lord Raglan personally, orthe Quartermaster-General, depicting to themr the fearful sufferings of the horsec, and urging them in every possible manner either to allow the cavalry to be moved to a position less exposed, or where their forage or the materials for hutting vould be available. It is difficult to exaggerate my anxiety at this time, and your Lordship must observe, that before any stabling could be constructed it was necessary for a permanent winter camp to be fixed upon, whichlwould depend uponthe state of the siege of Sebastopol, and the means of defence Lord Raglan had at his disposal to proteet the rear of his position. Both Lord Raglan and General Canrobert felt that they could not spare the cavalry at that time, and detained them accordingly. At he moment that Colonel Griffiths referred to the stabling of his horses we were only occupying a temporary camp, and it was undecided whether we were to shift to another position, still on the heights, but a little removed, or were to take up a permanent winter camp in the neighbourhood of Kadikoi; and this last was at the end of ten days decided upon. As has been said, Colonel Griffiths referred in a plaintive tone to the state of his horses, and in one of reproach. I, knowing from the past that I felt, to say the least, as much anxiety for the horses of the Greys as Colonel Grif fiths, replied accordingly; upon which this officer allowed limself a manner and the use of words so disrespectful that I desired him to desist, or I would place him under arrest. If Colonel Griiffiths in his evidence intended to say that[he was threatened with arrest for expressing any aniety about his horses, and not on account of his disrespectful manner in the conversation wlich followed, he has stated thatwbichisasunworthy of him asitis untrue. At this time no horse of my own, of my staff, nor do Ibelieve of any of the regimental officers, was stabled. I cannot recollect a single structure within the cavalry camp exceptmg Colonel Griffiths's kitchen. " M1y Lord, in this report inferences are drawn respecting the commissariat supplies, so far as the cavalry are concerned, so much at variance with the state of the case, that I think itmy duty to tender myself as a witness. No officer, so far as the Cavalry Division is concerned, can speak with equl knowledge and authority of all the circumstances and facts, and this report must continue very incomplete without my evidence. 'I have the honour, ce., " LUCAW, Major-General "P.S. Since writing the above, I am informed that there is no very pleasant mention made of the subjectof this letter in The Times. I have not read it, purposely; but your Lordship will, I am sure, feel that it is not now the less important to me that the examination I seek should be accorded. " LUCA-N.2

MONB-MABATanWlTYINTELLIGL?NOD. Fridxy Evening. The notice from the Chancellor of the Exchequer announcing the intention of Govermment to raise a loan, as well as to fund a portion of the floating debt, and inviting the attendance of capitalists at the Treasury next Monday, when the terms wil be communicated, was received at the Stock-Exchange this morning at about a quaxter past 11, and took every one by Eurprise. Tne funding of Exchequer-bills had been fully anticipated, but the raising of a loan, although considered certain in the course of the spring, was wholly muexpected at the present moment. Consols, which left off yesterday with much heaviness at 92, had opened at 914 to i, and immediately on the appearance of the notice they declined to 91. Large sales were then actively pres5ed, and the downward movement continued until the price touched 90, from which there was scarcely any recovery, the final transactions being at 90 to i for money and 90 to J for the account. The greatest eagerness was manifested throughout the day to learn the' amount intended to be asked for, and a variety of conjectures were circulated on the subject. Some persons endeavoured to create a belief that the loan will be for 20,000,0001., besides a funding of 9,000,0001. of Exchequer-bills; but an impression subsequently gained ground that the total wiU be altogether moderate, and that, although the Government deem it expedient before the commencement of the Peace Conferences to provide for all immediate wants, so as to complete the strength of their position, they entertain sufficient confidence to defer any further arrangements until a later period. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215; Reduced, 90I to 4; New Three per Cents., 914 to i; long Annuities, 3i; Annuities, I885, 164 ; and Exchequer-bonds, 974 to 98. The intended funding produced a good effect upon Exchequer-bills, in which India-bonds participated, the last quotations for both being 5s. discount to par. Owing to some sales of stock having been effected immediately at the opening of the market this morning, a statement was afterwards circulated that some knowledge of the intended announcement of the loan had been allowed at that time to transpire, but, on an inquiry being instituted before the Committee of the Stock-Exchange, it was ascertained that no foundation existed for the assertion. The biddings for the new loan, if the precedent adopted on the last occasion be foUlowed, will take place on Friday next. The terms in that instance were made known on Monday, the 16th of April, and the contract was concluded on the 20th. The price of Consols on the day of the contract was exactly the same as that at which they have closed this evening.| With the exception of several operations in Turkish, there was Ecarcely any business in foreign securities. The Six per Cents. closed yesterday about 94 to i, and were negotiated to-day at 92i and 934 for money, and 92i, 93i, 92, and 924 for the account, showing a fall of 14 per cent. Bargains took place in the Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock, for the account, at 1004, i, and 992, and the final quotation was 994 to 100. The other dealings comprised-Spanish New Deferred, 234; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no material alteration, but the rates generally showed a tendency to improvement. The corn-market was rather more firm this morning, and in some instances an advance of is. was obtained. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business at former prices. The quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this afternoon were 72f. oOc. for money and 73f. 45c. for the account, showing a reaction of three-quarters per cent. in sympathy with the fall on this side. The Bank of France returns, published to-day, are favourable, and partially account for the recent animation on the Bourse. The bullion has increased 590,0001., the. Treasury balance 306,0001., the deposits 90,0001., and the notes in circulation 792,0001. The discounts have decreased 276,0001., and the Bank has shown its confidence with regard to the fuiture by rescinding the resolution not to discount bills having more than 75 days to run, and returning to their former limit of 90 days. The report of the North of Europe Steamn Company, issued preparatory to their meeting on the 21st, exhibits the continuance of a remarkable degree of success. In AuLgust last a dividend at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum was declared, and a similar distribution is recommended on the present occasion, together with a bonus of 6s. per share, making a total equal to 6 per cent. for the half-year, or 10 per cent, during the entire 12 months. This will absorb 19,9941., after which there will remain-a surplus of 4,0851. to be added to a surplus of 1,2031. which accrued in 1854. Mleanwhile. sums of 6,0501. and 4,7001. have been set apart for depreciation and insurance funds. All the sources of traffic opened up by the company have fully realized the expectations entertained, and a great increase of employment is anticipated on the cessation of the war. For the future the company wil feel warranted in taking a larger proportion of their own insurance risk; and with regard to the question of incorporation they have suspended their intention of applying for an act of Parliament in consequence of the introduction of the new measure by Mr. Lowe. At a meeting of the General Screw Steam Company heldto-day, the resolution passed on the 10th ult., for obtaining a supplementarycharter to reduce the capital and authorize its return to the shareholders was confirmed. WVith regard to the purchase of the principal part of the Sleet by the French Clipper Company it was stated by the chairman that the preliminaries have been arrange& but that he could not then enter into details or the conditions of the transaction, the legal instruments being yet incomplete, although a deposit had been paid by the purchasers. The directors, however, he had no doubt, wvill be in a position at the approaching general meeting to announce the full particularsof the completed contract. The prospectus has been issued of a company for working the iron mines of Nova Scotia to be called the Acadian Iron Company, -with a capital of 200,C001., in 51. shares. The mines have been worked for some time by an association, and the quality of their iron and steel, in consequence of the manfaeture being with charcoal, is favourably known. Among the directors arepersons intimately connected with the trade of Sheffield. The town of Boulogne has recognized the claim of all the holders of shares in the former Boulogne and Ariens Railway guaranteed 4 per cent. by the town, and, on the proposition of the Mayor, M. Alexandre Adam, has agreed to repay the amount due in full, although without interest, by yearly instalments. In the colonial produce-markets during the week prices have again in many instances declined, and the extent of business has been only moderate. Sugar was in little demand at the commencement, but importers manifested a desire to meet the buyers, and submitted to a decline of 2s. per cwt. for the middlinlg and good dinds and is. per cwt. for the inferior. On these terms a considerable quantity of the large parcels brought to sale were freely taken by speculators, as well as by the home trade and exporters, the market closing with a better feeling. Privately somne busness a reported on the spot, but in floating cargoes nothing has been done. JRu iBshemvy, and a transaction i East India is reported at a fall of 2s. per gallon. The indigo quarterly sales commenced on Tuesday, and comprised 9,000 chests. There was a full attendance of home ancl export buyers, andu the demand was very active. For the good and fine Bengals, suitable for export purposes, and which were taken in a great measure for Russia, rates were paid 104L to 1Id. per lb. over the October saW rates, while 8d. to 9d. per lb. advance was obtained for the middling and good. Low and ordinary Oudes are in less request, at 6d. to 8d. per lb. enhancementt; Kurpabs are freely bought, at a rise of 8d. to 9d. per lb. for middling and good; ordinary and low, 6d. per lb.; and Madras about 3d. per lb. The quantity passed has been 4,400 chests, of which 2,670 have been Fold. In tea, with the exception of common coagou, which is very aepressed, and can be bought uder 9d. per lb., there is, no alteration, Public aales ara to take place on Thursday. Coffee has. been very sparingly brought forward, and the Ceylon kinds have been disposed of at a decline. REice 6l continues dull. The business trasaeted haa been moderate, and a fall of 4d. per cwt. has been accepted fov a parcel of cargo Bengal. Saltpetre has changed hands at still lower quotatiols. There is no alteration in spice, with the exception of cassia lignea, a parcel of which went at a fall of abont 3s. er cwft. The Vanguard arrived to-day in the let India Dock with an entire cargo of rice from Madagascar, being the first imprta,tion of the kind direct from that-island.

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. GREAT WEST1RN. ' The half-yearly 3iiecting of this company was held yesterday at the Paddington station, the Right Ron. S. Walpole, ALP., in the chair. The special and ordinary reports, abstracts of which have aq a in T7he Timnes, were taken as read. The CiwuhArS said,-You place in your direction a great confidence, which I hope and trust you will think with me they have not abused. I can truly tell you that they have -devoted the autumn, together with myself, in! investigating those affairs in the minutest manner, at a sacrifice of time which few can appreciate unless they had gone through that investigation-at a sacrifice wvhich they did not 'grudge to you, because they know that they are your trustees, and that it is their bounden duty as well as interest to put your affairs in the best position in which they can be place. Now, I stated my opinion to be, that.the depression of your shares was a temporary, not a permanent depression. Look at the rcsults-your average receipts during the half-year ending December 31, 1855, as compared with the average receipts during the half-year endingDecember 31, 1854, show an increase in your Great Western lines of 8,0001.; and on your Shrewsbury lines, of 23,0001. more. (Hear, hear.) The balances of the revenue accounts carried to credit, when contrasted with the same period, show for the Great Western line3 in 1854 a result of 383,2271.; and for 1845 a receipt of 438,3271., giving an increase of net earnincs of 54,4001. The Shrewsbmry lines show, for 1854, a sum of 32,639l. as against 47,7991L for 1855, or a net increase of eamings of 15,1601., making, on the whole of your property, a total increase of net earnings of 69,5601. (Cheers.) Now, observe the increase is not a partial one; it is uniform throughout your line. Observe, also, that this increase is not an increase made by fits and starts, but by steadyprogression. Observe, in the third p lace, that this increase is stil continuing, and the receipts during the first sir weeks of the present halfyear wilr,Ithink, justify me in saying the company is gradually righting itself, and that if you pursue a prudent, cautious management of your affairs, you will find it will right it,elf Iti more. ffind that the receipts for the first six weeks of 1856, of the Great Wetem line, show i total increase of 14,6371., or an average of about 2,3651. per week in favour of the present year. (Cheers.) The increase during the six weeks on the Surewsbury and Birmingham line vas 8551. 12s. 2d., and on the Shrewsbury and Chester line 2,7291. 12s. 7d., making. a total of 3,5831 4s. 9d., or an averame of 5971. per week. I mention these facts to show. you tat I thinkl I was right in stating that the depreciation of your property I was not lkely to be a permanent depreciation, if you found bysuheequent experience-as you do now find by subsequent experience-that there was an improvement going on over every part of your line, and that this improvement was consistent and also progressive. The secind Point which I mentioned was tfat you had seen the worst of your Shrewabury lines. In that respect I think mystatement has bee fully vrified. The charge on the Great western revenue for the guaranteed dividend to the Shrewabury coipanies for the half-year ending June, 1855, wias 34,09001., an for the half-year ending 31st of December last, 17,5001.; 1 thinlk, therefore, you may fairly say that in the month of August last you had seen the worst of the guaranteed dividend on your ShrewaburyIm les. Nowuthe third point to vwhich I adverted wams a request on your part thsatyou would .susped giving judgment with resecj t to the future prospects of tbecompanyunmtil I had had an opport nit-y of investigating the w hole of its affir.s, and of placing a statement of them in the hands of the directo rs, anud subsequently'of the proprietor' hands. You havie that statement now before you, and what iS the result? I think that anybody w-ho looks at that statement has. the fullest means of judging fon himself of the amoent of your avaiable assets, of the extent of your liabilities, the minutest items of your revenue and expenditure, the clearest notion of your traffic, and, I hope, of forming a fair and just conchsion as to the prospects of the company as deducible from these previous stateinents; and, accordingly, as the report ends, I think your diectors are justified in stating that "4It is fair to conclude that there is much reason for confidence and hope, and that the proprietors will ultimately find, wrhen the causes of the present depression have been removed, that they possess an investment which i permanently valuable and intrinsically secure." You will observe that your dividend has this half-year been increased to 2.; per cent, from 2 per cent. (Hiear.) Thtis alone w.ill, I hope to some extent, be satisfactory to you. 1ousillalso observe that the balance on the revenue account is much larger than it was in the last half-year, and thatyoar directors have kept in hand about 16,0001. in respect of that balance. The report statc3 that there wias an arbitration bv which a further sum is ex-pected from the South Wales 'Company for the agreed use of the Glocester st.ation and establishmsent ever since they have opened their line; that that arbitration is nearly brought to a close; and that the amount uNill appear to credit in the next account. A small sum onlv was tak-en under that head to credit, but I have the satisfaction to state to you that the arbitration on this point was closed yesterday, and that you may add under that head to the credit of y our account a sum of 5,100L (Cheers.) The result, then, is that your avaltable balance for dividend .amoup the proprietors forthe last half-year, instead of being what it is reptesented to be in the accounts,. is 5,000L more, wihich, added to the balance that we have'held in reserve -of I,0001-would, in point of fact, just enable you to pay at this moment a 3 per cent dividend. (Hear.) Now, I do not recommend you to ask for a 3 per cent. dividend, and I wmill tell you why. I think one of the greatest points you have to bear in mind is, that you wiUl be prudent and cautious before the vessel has properly righted itself; and I think that till your works are completed, whieh they soon will be, that till your liabilities are thereby perfecly ascertained, it is safer for you to keep that balance in hand to meet contingiencies, and winch will be a balance available for you at a future period, though, as I have said, I recomiendyounotto make at available for an increase of dividends now. On portons of your line there are some valuable collieries; some of the coals have hitherto been brou"ht to London in smal quantities, and there is a great marcet for it.. Your directors have constantly turned in their minds the best mode by wihich they enuld attiLn a lar"e freight for the coal, which is in great request in London. 'There is to'my mind a very valuable proposition. It is this-a joint-stock company has been formed for working somc of these collieries. The arrangement proposed is this, that we should take the coals at the lowest freight wlhich is remunerative to ourselves, the proprietors of these collieriesundertakingto sendus stated quantities, so that we should get a remuneration on the large amount which would not be a remuneration on the smaller, and I have every reason to believe, from a most accurate statement laid before me, that there is a demand for the coal in the London market whichwill, in the course of two years from thistime, give you a freight, vithout any risk. of 50,0001. or 60,0004 a-year. (Hear, hear.) What, therefore, I would propose on this bead is, that we should take a resolution author g the directors to enter into an arrangement to that extent only, and I hope that the proprietors will have confidence enough in the directors to see that they will not make that arrangement unless they are moraUy certain it is a provident one. (Hear, hear.) One thing connected with this arrangement I have got to mention, and that is, that some of the shareholders in this joint-stock companyare shareholders in this company, and some of them are also officers or servants of this company. The whole question has been fully considered by the directors, and they thought it desirable to bring it fully before the meeting in order that you may not be taken by surprise. What we recommend is this-" If there seemed to be any probable conflict of interest in a matter so important both to the railway companv and the lessees of the colliery, the board would have hesitated to entertain any question of arnangement with a joint-stock company so constituted; but they believe, on the contrary, that transacting such business openly and avowedly, upon fixed and definite conditions, with indiNiduals directly interested in the welfare of this company (subject to the abovementioned qualification), and neither exclusivelv nor preferentially with such company, but rather as an inducement to similar arrngements with other companies or persons, upon equal terms and conditions, will be justand right in principle, as well as extremely beneficial to tho company." You will bear in mind the words in the parenthesis, " subject to the abovementioned qualification," and you will find we carefully guard ourselves against the continuance in our service. of any officer or servant of the company who may be directly interested in the3managementof the oal trade, in order that there may be no conflict whatever between the shareholders or servants of this company and the s'hareholders of the joint-stock companyproposedtobeestablhshed. The statementforinterestox your debenture debt is much more full -thanithashithertobeen. Manyobservationshavebeen made on this point at former meetings. Your directors have considered how they could give you the fuUest satisfaction on the subject, and they have stated the interest on the face of the accounts in a way which affords every shareholder the amplest opportunity of judging what that interet is. No interest has ever been kept to a suspense or reserve account, and the shareholdersxnow as wea as the directors the exact state of the accounts in that particular. Two of your directors have given notice in the public organs of information that they intend to resign their seats at this board. Most sincerely do I regret it. (Cheers.) Of those directos I can speak not only,in the language of personal esteem, but in. the highest terms of the value of the services they have rendered to the com,pany. It is peculiarly pain ful- to me (from circumstances to which I will briefly allude hereafter) to think that at such a moment there should be any-apparent difference at a board which has been singu. larly umited. The ground of difference is one which in itself, I think-my friends wvll pardon me for saying sowas not sufficient to constrain themn to leave the board The ground of difference is simply confined to a practical- point which was brought before the board -whether a. traffic committee should be appointed, - or -vwhether the mana"ement of the traffic should be placed before the boara as a board in its collective cha- racter~. 2-or either proposition a great deal might be Faid - I thilk-the latter was the preferable one of the two, and for this reason, that it is certainly advantageous that every matter which concerns the direction of a greaf company like this shouldbe made familiar to every director, and that every director should feel himself responsible for it. By delegating it to a special committee we incur a risk of some directors attending to one part of the business more than others would be found to do. I wish not to enter into any controversywith my friends on this subject; I value their feelings and respect their independence far toe ntueh to say a word which can introduce controversy between them and me-a controversy which I take leave to say they will tell you has never occured. (Cheers.) But I have here a duty to perfonn I am at this moment, and have been down to this-ftoment, the organ of the board as well as the representative of the company. As the-organ- of the board, my first duty was, and I maysay, a to keep that board as much as possible in harmony, with. each other. Mydutywas, andis, topreventas far asspossi- ble anythinglike a differenco of opinion ending fnu apositive diagreement. My duty was, and is, to endeavour to -per- su2ae you, the propnetosof this company, never to enter- which I am sure you wi not do-into unseemly discusions about your affairs, but that when you have anything to state to your directors of which you have reason to complain, you wil do so frankldy, freely, and temperately;* and lmsrthat you will meet with every consideration. (Hear.) I said it was peculiarly: painful to mie that this apparent difference should have occUred at- this particuLar moment. There are those in this room who are well aware that the brief period during which I have had the honour of occupying this chair was likely to terminate almost necessarily when Parliament w.as summoned to meet again. I had duties there to performn, and duties bere to perform, and the most I could promise last August was, that I would sacrifice, as I have sacrificed, the whole of my Parliamentary avocation to see what 1 could do in your behalf. There is a point, however, beyond which human. exertion can hardly go. Had I remainedexactly in the same position I then was, still I should question whether I could discharge that double set of duties without the neglect of one or the other. But with other duties cast on me, I must frankly communicate to you at once that I fear it is impossible-nay, I may say it is beyond my physical strength-to continue to discharge tlose double dutics, and I am sure your company will not suffer from it, when I look around this table and see directors to whom your affairs are so well intrusted. If, however, I can be of any service by continuing to hold a seat at your board, and should it be your pleasare I should so continue (loud cheers), I will do my utmost to assist these, whoever they maybe, who occupy that hi-h and honourablo-position of members of such a- body. I wili say no more. I havead. dressed you at greater length than I intended, and all I can now say-is that if I were asked to give my opinion, on your future prospects, I could honestly and conscientiously say, that if yon will adhero -to the wise maxims you have laid down for yourselves, of not entering into newv speculations (cheers)-if you will strive to keep in hannony with other companies, which must be for the mutual benefit of both -if you will steadily watch the rise of your shares, and the fall in the value of money in the market, until you can convert your debt into stock and reduce its interestif you will finish, as vour directors have shown to you that you are about to finish, all your great works, without incnaring new liabilities-again, I say, my honest, consciencious conviction is that you have a property which, by provident,'by careful, by seaulous good management, will be valuable to yourselves as an investment and as an inconie, and will be restored, I hope, at no distant day,. to that high position in which it fonuerly stood. (Loud cheers.) Mr. MAINs said that the Chairman had given a pledge that he would examine into the cause and state of the company's affairs, and had redeemed that pledge to the fullest extent. That examination had shown their affairs to be in a better position than vas expected. They had no cause to repine, but there were reasons why they should not give up to that desponding tone that some parties were prone to indulge in respect to the Great Western affairs. The working expenses were about 42 per cent., and were .as lowas those of any other great company, and he thought before long they would resume their 4 per cent. dividend, and afterwards it would go up to a per cent. and upwrards. (Hear, hear.) Ho considered the reports were highly satisfactory, and that it would be a matter of of deep reret if the twio gentlemen, who had expressed a determination to retire, should not continue at the board. The CH.ArOIOAN moved a formual resolution to the effect, that the special report of the directors and the ordinary report be received and adopted. lord BeAnRINGTON seconded the motion. Mr. EnVARIns had the highest respect for the directors, and particularly for their chairman. He would regret exceedingly if they were to lose his services. With regard to the special report of the directors, be thought it w.oulSd have beenbetter had they called in the assistance and advice of some of the shareholders who hold a large interest in the company, as it wonld have tended to give more confidence. Had the dividend remained at 4 par cent., he did not think he would have complained hut, beinga man witha large family, the depreciation in the price of the stock and the faling off in the dividend had been severely felt by him and others. Hethoughtthe auditors had not-nade the accounts as clear as they might have teen made. Every item should show the profit or loss attending it. He concluded by moving an amendment to the effect, that so much of the report as referred to the dividend of 21 per cent. be adopted, and that the rest of it be referred to a committee of sharcholders, to be appointed after the directors had furnised them with a list of the shareholders to select a committee from. Major COURT had greatpleasuro in seconding the motion, as he had intended to move a similar resolution. He thanked him personally for bringing the motion fonrard. He found they ad expended 795,0001. during the half-year, of which sunm 300,0001. consisted of unproductive capital. There were. many items which he thought required explanation, as he did not understalid them. -With regard to the' working stock, it had cost them altogether 1,826,0001., which, at 2,3001. per mile, would be sufficient to work 800 miles. Now, in all, they would not have more than 700 miles to work, and thereforo they had sufficient stock to work their system. He objected to expending a firther sum of 250,0001., as roposedi the special report, for the Wilts, Somerset, and WrVeymouth line. Bnr. HOYEs said, he was of opinion that the Great Western Company had seen its worst days. He trusted that nothing had occurred which wvould prevent those gentlemen, Mr. S. Baker and Mr. Potter. going back to their seats at the board., His opinion was in favour 6f wosking the line by means of committees, as proposed by those gentlemen. fle had the very highest respect for Mr. Saunders. Ho considered him one of the ablest men in the kingdom. He bad served thecompany faithfuUy adwevll for a quarter of a century, and if they took care of him hc would probably sen-e them for another quarter of a century; MIr. POTER said, it was not the intention of Mr. S. Baker or himself to havc said anything at the meeting. Ho thanked Mr. Walpole for the kind manner in whieh he had mentioned him in his address. He (Mr. Potter) appeared there as a considerable proprietor of stock in the company. The majority of the directors were desirous of continuing the same system as that which had been adopted from the commencement, or at least for thelast 15 years. They had ableand honourableofficersinthercempany,and althoughhMr. Baker and himself differed in opinion from the majority of the board, it was right to state that there was nothing behind and nothing beyond what he had stated in respect to that difference. zbe Great Northern, the London and North-Western, the Midland, and other companies adopted the system of committees over certain departments, and that wvas a strong point in favour of adopting that system in the Great Western Cosmpany. He thought they might fairly discuss the question, and recommend it for the consideration of the board. Mr. haLES thought they might Safely adopt the course recommended by Mr. Potter. He complained of the way in which coalfields in Somersetshire were allowed to remain undeveloped, and thought if a traffic committee wvere appointed by the board ti at the matter would be attended to. (Hear, hear.) He hoped the two directors would not leave the board. Mr. NoRsus did not approve the system of dividing the board into various commnttees. He preferred keeping the board as a whole, and holding each member responsible for all its acts. If committees were appointed, the responsibility would be removed from the proper quarter. Ho hopedthose two gentlemen would not leave the board in the present state of affairs. A long and rather noisy discussion ensued, in the course of which it was contended that the affairs of the company should be conducted on strictly commercial principles. Resolutions wvere passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend at the rate of 2A per cent. per -annum for the half-year, and electing the retiring directors.. Mr. Mus proposed a resolution to the effect that no person officialy connected with the service of the company, and paid by the company, be allowed to be interested directly or indirectly in collieries or in any joint-stock onmpany, mentioned in the special report, trading with the company. After some observations from Lord Barrington, M hr. Russell, and other gentlemen on the impolicy of the motion, it wvas negatived by a large mnajority. XThe directors were authorized to raise money on the remainder of the newv stock, either by instalments or a vances, for the purpose of finishing the works. -They were also authorized to expend 70,0001. on the new station at Paddington to complete it, ;50,0001. on additional plant, and 50,0001. for sidngs, in accordance with the special report of 1806. On the motion being put for sanctioning an arrangement with a joint-stock company for working the collieries near the railway and alowig the officials of the company to subscribe, subject to certain restrictions, it was strenuously opposed by Mnr MIiles and other gentlemen, but, on a show of hands, it was carried. Mrr. Miles demanded a poll, which, howvever, he subsequently withdrew, and the proceedings cenenduded with a cordial vote of thanks to the chairman, with a request that he would retain office, which he declined to,promise. Tlhe meeting then separated. NORTH-EASTERN. it is proposed to declare a dividend for the half-year endingthe 31st of Decemberlast at therateof 41a per eent per annum on the Berick shares and stock; *of 31 per cent. perOn aum oathe York stock and shares, leaving balances of 5,3777 and 1,3641. respectively for the nest account. The available balance oa th leeds revenue account amounts to 56,7271., and the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. upon the preference quartes and the extensions; s per cent. oaths fist issue, and of 3A per cat. on the second issue of the preference fifth shares. After laying aside 37,4021. for arrears of interest, there will remain a balance of 8,4a91. DllTCH RHENSH. Oa Tuesday the Prussian junction line of this comnpany from Arnheimn to Emmerieh was opened by the directors and their friends, and the event was colebrated by a dinner at Arnhein. It was arranged to open the line for public !traffic yesterday.-
TiEE Snpo'w-Ess AD TiE Govnnrnim .-The bil brought into Parliament by Mir. Lowe, the Vice-President of the Board of Trade, for the abolition of lbeal burdens on shipping, was printed on Wednesday, and reached the north on Thursday. It has given great satisfaction to the shipowners, and on Thursday, a few hours after copies of the billreached South Shields, a requisition signed by above 200 of the leading shipowners and merchants was presented to the Mayor, requesting him to caU a public meeting to petitionParliament m favour of the bill, and to adopt measures to support the Government in passing it through Parliament. The Shipowners' Societies of Sunderland, South Shields, and Tynemouth have appointed influential inembers of their bodies to proceed to London to meet delegates 'rom other towns to give the necessary support to the Government and the Board of Trade in their arduous umdertaking in attempting to remove all local taxes upon shipping, except such as are necessary for their protection in harbour and the purposes of navigation. With - the exception of Neweastle, the Government. will receive the votes, of all the members for seaports in the&counties of Durh.nn and Northnmberland in carryig this bill through the House of Commons; and the shipowners are exceedingly active in securing Parliamentary influence. By a misprint in a paragm4ph in 1iec Times of Tuesday the sbipowners were described as "resisting" -them Government instead rof assisting." - Afterwhat we have written above, we need not repeat that the Government bill is highly popular with the north-country Ehipowners. The measur& is also popular with the manufacturers and large shippers, and has the support of Manchester and other large towns interested in free navigation,
SACRED HAlLIrONIC SOCIETY. Irf. Costa's sacred oritoro of Eli, which, it wi be remew bered, was received with such enthusiasm at' Birmingham in August, 1855, -was produced last night; after long and careful preparation,, at - Exeter-hall. The occasion was rendered further - interesting by the presence of Eer Majesty, who attended with his Royal Highness Prince Albeit, andifoiir of the Royal children. The ha4:ag might have been antiipated, was crowded to suffocation. The Queen arrived with her accustomed punctuality, and was received with cheers. As the MiusPartYertered thebuiding,theNationaIAthemiwa perfor,ed (Madame Ruder3dorff undertaking the solos) an astyle of unusual excellence, the chorus having no little share in the effect. In short, without dispanrgement to the Italian Opera and other theatrical establifihnents, it is a fact that one seldom hears "God Save the Queen" well sung and played, except at the concerts of the Sacred Harmonic Society. The oratorio of IEU was described at sueh length in the reports of the last tliirranghamn Musical Festival that we are spared the pains of enteiing into an elaborate discussion of its merits. Nor does closer experidnee justify any modification of the opinions expressed upon that occadon. The same beauties and the same defects are as apparent now as then. If Eli had any claim to be viewed in the light of a great comnposition, if somenoveltyof plan, or striking originality in the general charaeter of its ideas warranted the presumption thatitwas a work of genius, nottobethoroughlyunderstod and appreciated until after frequent and attentive hearings, sonie colourable plea might be found- for reconsisering, perhaps for reversing, a judgment which would then be open to arraignment, and not without reason, as premature. But it has no pretensions of the sort; A more intiniate acquaintance not simply confirms but strengthens ourl first iripressions. Mr. Costa had, no doubt, a very difficult task to accomplish, since the history of Eli affords but few situations favourable to the construction of a grand sacred drama, while such as it actually unfolds have niot been treated very effectively by Mr. Bartholomeau- The first part, which should gradually lead to the culminating point in an oratolio (instance Israel in Egypt and Elijahz) ends with an anti-climax. After the intecest has been worked up to a certain degree by the advance of the Philistines, who threaten to annihilate the erring Israelites, the " denunciation" of the man of God and the dedication of Saumel in the Temple, by Hannah, his mother, suddenly check it in a dramatic sense (and an oratorio is neither more nor less than a sacred musical drama). The conclusion thus inevitably becomes as flat as it ought to be spirited anld exciting. The second part is liable to a similar objection; but here the musician, in a greater degree than the author of the book, invites reproach, since he has illustrated the im- p i passage of Samuel's call by the Lord, when Eli and f31kanah's favoured son are reposing,with singular tameness; while the strikin- incident of Is sudden death, after hearing of the defeat of the Israelitish army, the slaughter of his two eons, and the capture of the Aik of God by the victoriousPhilistines-whichpresentedsograndanopportunitv not only for the display of imagination and musical skill, but for creating a fresh and absorbing interest whore it was most required, and thereby maintaining the balance of effect-has by no means suggested any new or startling idea to the composer. So that the oratorio flags twice, and just in those places where it was of imp6rtance to sustain it at tl.e hiighest point. Add to the above a want of variety in the musib of Eli, who has nothing to sing but slow and sclemn recitatives and airs, and an almost uniform weakaces in the fugues, of w,hichthere are too many, considering their quality, though not too many for an oratorio of sueh length, especially when the musician is determined to emulate the contrapuntal devices of the old masters, and we have done with animadversion. The rest of our task is far more agreeable. Eli will owe w hatever popularity it attains to the airs and somen of the less pretending choruses. Many of the former are so melodious, graceful, and musically expressive that they must alvays p ease, even if sung with moderate ability, much more when given toperfection, as they were, for the greater part, Last night. Theinorning and evening prayers of S.amuel("Lord, from my bed againi I rise," and "This night I lift my heart to thee") are both exquisitely beautiful alnd instinct with devotional feeling. Hannah's first air, "Turn thee unto me," is full of expression and genuine tune. Not a little of the merit of this Last is traceable to its admirably managed contrast with the burst of relgious exultation, "I will extoloThee, 0 Lord," in which the happy wife of Elkyana, no longer barren, hut fruitful, pours out the abundance of her gratitude to the Almighty in His temp.le. There is, tee, in the music given to Elkanah atranquiUhity of character extremely appropriate to the calm and deliberate faith which is the distinguishing characteristic of that personage. The soft choruses,. accompanied by harps-" The Lord is geed" and "No evil shall hefal thee"-if not strik;ingly originl,L are nothing short of lovelyintheirmelodious flow, and in the well contrivedsaimplicityof theiraccompaniments. The trioforHannahSamucL, and Idlkanah, " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God," and the unaccompanied quartet, " We bless you in the name of the Lord," in which Eli adds a bass voice to the soprano, contralto, and tenor, are essentially tuneful, besides being voiced to perfection. Indeed, Mr. Costa's manner of Writing for voices must be uireserve(Uy praised, since it shows that he has studied to eminent advantage in the very best schools. His instrumentation, too, is clear and niasterly, although not remarkable for experiments in new paths, or for much ingenious and elaborate contrivance. But what matters this, so long as it completely satisfies the educated ear, and gives pleasure to the uninitiated, who are not able to analyze their sensations scientificaUy ? Mr. Costa's method of writing for the orchestra does both, and therefore merits unrestricted eulogy. - - Not to enter, however, into further particulars at present (it being reasonable to suppose we are to have snore than one opportunity of recurring -to Eli, which we sincerely hopem say turn, out a mine of wealth to the Sacred Ham emoni Society), we beg leave to depart from our usual custom and refer to an article upon the oratorio of Mr. Costa which appeared in the review of the Birmiingiam FestivaL Prom this we are anxious to extract one or tvo passages, since, had we listened to Eli for the first time last night, we coald hardly have coni veyed more exactly, ingeneral terms,the impressions derived finn its performance. A description of the wholly unI recedented enthusiasm with which it was received is succecded by the following remarks:- ,"Under the circumstances described the task of the critic-whose duty it is to rest calm in the midst of excitement-becomes not only difficult but unwelcome. No amounlt of praise we could award would tally w,ith the effect produced to-day by the oratorio of Eli. Even to hail it as a great work would sound like faint homage, after such an exhibition. UJnhappiy,wre are placed, so to speak, on the horns of a dilemma. To bow to the verdict of the crow;d would be to violate our own conscience; to- dispute its justice would be to set at nought the strongly pronounced opinion of the publci, which we are always accustomed to respect. There is notbing left, however, but to choose the least of two evils; and, as truth does not depend upon the mere.caprice of an hour, we shall state our impresions, aiter more than one very attentive hearing, without heiltation. Eli is a work of great cleverness, displaying a large degree of musical knowledge and experience, athorough acquaintance with the resources of orchestral ins atruments, a command of voices, and of the art of writing for them in parts, which some acknowledged composers might envy, a certain flow of elegant if not very original melody, and considerable fanoy in the arramgement of details. It is not a great work; it is not a work of genius, nor one that has a chance of enduring after the popular influence exercised by its composer shah have depalted with himself. As a first attempt at sacred oratorio however, it is more than creditable, and entitled, indeed, to warm encouragement. From this point of view, which we are convinced every new heari-w wil confirm, we shall endeavour to offer some general observations on the work" An analysis of the work ensues, which closes with the observations underneath - " Mr. Costa has made a bold effort-the boldest, indeed, that could be ventured on by a musician, since the sacred oratorio imperatively demands an elevation of style, a variety of resources, and a profundity of science, to say nothing of invention and imagination, which only the very greatest masters have possessed. If, then, his first oratorio cannot be pronounced a niodel in that high brauch of musical composition to which it belongs, hemust be satisfied (like othersbefore him) to accept the praises.which are his just due. Hisambition was laudable;, and he has exhibited a degree of talent in El.which entitleshim to the high and lovers of music, if it is not likely We have nothing to add and nothing to take away from the above. In these barren times a work of genius from a comparatively new pen would he of too great benefit and importance to thousands of deserving persona not to be welcoied with avidity, by the critic no less than by the crowd. But works of genius are unfortunately rare; and, if we would render them justice w hen they do appear, we must not be indiscriminate in bestownvg upon clever, energetic, andindustriousmenthehighest possible amount of praise that can be awarded to the successful essays of "the chosen few"-the most richly and wonderfully endowed. TheLperformancelast night was in most respects highly creditable to the members of the Sacred Harmonic Society; but we must postpone a detailed notice of it till Monday. The principal singers, to be brief, were ununually successf The first encote was obtained by Mr. Sims Reeves, whose execution of the dashing war song of the Philistine chief"Philistines, hark the trumpets sounding"-was superb, and raised the enthusiasm of the audience to such a pitch that they forgot the presence of Majesty and the etiqjuette which usually and very properly accompanies it. The Queen, however, was nothing averse, since Her Majesty herself gave the signal for repetition. ¶1besepond(and thelast) encorewas awardedto the unaccompanid quartet-" We bless you in- the name of the lore."-which was sung in a manner -wholly irreproachable by madame Rildersdora 3Miss Dolby, Mr. Sims Reeves, and Mr. Weiss, and enchanted the crowd beyond measure. Madame RSidersdorZf, to whom was allotted the principal soprdno musie, never sang better since she-first appeared in tondon, and, it must be owned, srpasssed the Birmingham original. Miss Dolby, in the contrao music of Samuel, if she did not quite equal the dramatic conoeption of Madame Viardot, whose singing in Eli cannot easily be forgtten, gave a readin of her own which was- oh4rming, and executed the muic to perfection. Both the b4sses-Mr. Weiss - (Eli) and Mr. Thomas (the Man of Guid)-were entitled to unqualified praise; and Mr. Montem Snuth did the most for the second tenorp}at-a veryinsigniflcantone Thebandwas nexceptionable from the overture to the end (what will notour orchestral performers do for the music of their idol9.), and, )r Brovwnsmith deserves speci4l notice for his able e-eecution of the organ pf chi oef no small consequence: -n the- orAtorio' of E oeof . -the chorases werb capitally sung, but others left. much to be.desired;and, to be stto a~ great roin'ial toen, the Bmanixgbam.performauce was very far superior in most respects to our frst metro olitai~ easay. lietween the parts the Xoyal party retired to talce some refresbment, and no sooner had they quitted the hail than a loud cheer. was-raised forMfr. tCosta.-- The.nae tribultewa aecorded t thepopula.r cef co)ztrc at theendof theoratorio, when (and not before) the illustrious party took their leave, amid the mnost loyal demonstiations; At this juncture the enthusiasm for 3fr.
