PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. Their lordships met at 5 o'clock, at which time the space ielow the throne and the galleries wars completely crowded hy members of the House of Commons and strangeis, in anticipation of an interesting debate on the important question efthe prerogative of the Crown on the one hand, andthe .privileges of the House of Peers on the other, arising out of the motion about to bo brought forward by lord Lyndhurst for the production of the letters patent purporting to create ihe Eight Hon. Sir James Parke, Knight, a baron of the United Idngdom for life. There was likewise a full attendance of Peers on the occasion. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY presented a petition from ministers of all Protestant denominations at Eastwood, praying that a law bo passed to regulate and control all unlicensed brokers or dealers in second hand goods in Scotland. THE "WENSLEYDALE HFE PEERAGE. Lord LYNDHURST rose, pursuant to notice, to move " That the copy of tho letters patent purporting to create the Right Hon. Sir James Parke, Knight, a baron of the united kingdom for life, which has been laid upon the table, be referred to the Committee for Privileges, with directions to examine and consider tho same, and report thereon to the House.'" She subject (he said) which I am about to bring under the notice of your lordships is one of Tery considerable importance, because it relates to the composition of your lordships? House; and the question is whether the ancient Jjereditary character of thi3 House is to continue, or -whether it is to -bo broken in upon and be remodelled io the extent and according to the discretion and interest of the Ministry for the time being. (Hear, hear.) I havo been requested by some of my friend3 to bring this subject fully before your lordships. In the performance of that duty I will endeavour to state tho case plainly and simply, so as to render it intelligible to your lordships; and I will further, in the performance of that duty, endeavour to encroach as little as po saible upon your patience and attention. My lords, it must not be supposed for a moment that there is any personal objection to my learned friend, the late Baron Parke, in the motion 1 am now about to submit. (Cheers.) The objection is, not that he is about to be raised to a place in this house, fcut that he is to bo raised in a different form, and shorn of the usual consequences ofa patented peerage. It is now upwards of 30 years since I first was intrusted withthe custody cf the great seal, and one of the earliest acts of my official life was to recommend this learned gentleman to the Sovereign f or » seat upon thc judicial bench. The manner in which he has discharged the duties of that high office, his assiduity, his industry, his learning, and impartiality do more than justify the appointment, -they do honour to tbe selection. (Hear, hear.) My lords, thero are circumstances incidental to the position of the learned gentleman which add to the importance of this question. He is advanced in life; he is a married man; he has no son; nor, allow me to say with hesitation, is there any likelihood of ason. It is quite clear, therefore, that^ -whether he have a peerage for life or a peerage in the usual form, practically as far as that peerago is concerned it would he precisely tho same thing. Tlie obvious consequence, iherefore, is-and I believe no person will pretend to deny it-that this is intended to act as a precedent for fut**rc occasions (hear, hear), and to enable the Minister for the time being to place in tliis house as many tenants forlife in the peerage as may suit his interest at anv futnre periods in the history of this country. Bnt, my lords, I must beg to protect myself against any misapprehension of what 1 am about to say. I have received too many marks of the favour of my Sovereign ; I feel too grateful for those instances of her favour to render it possible I should entertain any disrespect whatever for her. It must, therefore, le considered that in everything which falls from me upon this occasion I am not speaking of thc Sovereign personally, lut of tlie advisers of the Sovereign. (Hear, hear.) When I talk of the prerogative of the Crown, of the manner in which tliat prerogative is exercise d, I must be nndeistood as referring not to the manner in which it is exercised by the Sovereign personally, bnt of the manner in which it is exercised by her advisers, according to the nsual constitutional course of proceeding in eases of this description. fHear, hear.) My lords, it is said-and I hear it repeated ever and over again-that tliis is part of the prerogative of the Crown, aud that the Crown may legally appoint a peer for life. Assuming that to be tlio case (though I shall advert to the subject more particularly by-and-by), it does sot follow that every exercise of such a prerogative is consistent with the principles of the constitution. (Hear, hear.) The Sovereign may by his prerogative, if ho thinks proper, create a hundred peers with descendible finalities in the course of a day. Tliat would be consistent with the preiogative> and would be strictly legal; but everybody must feel and everybody must know that such an exercise of the undoubted prerogative of the Crown would be a flagrant violation of the principles of the constitution. (Hear.) In thesame manner the Sovereign might place tbe great seal -instead of giving it to a person, Uke my noble and learned friend, distinguished for his legal and other attainmentsin the hands of a person, a layman, wholly unacquainted with the laws of the country. That also would be a flagrant violation of the constitution of this country. Other cases might, at the same time, be adduced, bnt the examples I have already cited are sufficient to establish the principlo which I maintain. Now, my lords, thc position which I mean to lay down, and which I can maintain, is, that no instance has occurred in the history of this' country within the last 400 years in which any commoner has been raised to a seat in this house by a patent of peerage containing only an estate for life. Every peison who has studied the constitution of this countiy, and who is at all conversant with the principles upon which it is founded, must be aware that one of these principles is long-continued nsage-lex et consuetudo Parliamenti. That is one of the main principles on wiiich our constitution rests. Going back a period of 400 years in order to select three, or four, or half-a-dozen instances in which the Crown has performed a particular act by virtue of its prerogative, before the constitution was formed, before it was brought into a regular shape, andto make those precedents the foundation forachangeinthe composition of eitherHouse of Parliament, is, I contend, a gross violation of the principles of the constitution. (Hear.hear.) My lords, let me look back to the times to-which I refer. What extraordinary powers were then claimed and exercised by the Crown, and were considered a part of its undoubted prerogative! The Sovereign would issue his writ to certain towns,desiringthem to return members to Parliament; he would then issue his writ a second time, continuing certain of those boroughs and discontinuing others, thus altering at his discretion the wholo constituent body of thecountry. There are cases aiso of this description :-To peers entitled beyond all dispute to a seat in this house, and to a deliberative voice among us, »_ writ of summons was sometimes sent, sometimes discontinued, so that tho House was remodelled according to the discretion and will of the Monarch for tho time being. There are cases where peers have been summoned for a single Parliament, summoned for a single session, then discontinued, and then summoned again. (Hear, hear.) There are cases of peerage during pleasure, and there are cases even where a peer has been created to exercsie all tho rights of the peerage with the single exceptionand it is certainly a remarkable exception-of the right of sitting in Parliament. Hy lords, in the time to wiiich I refer the Crown exercised a power of dispensing with the laws of the countiy. She exercised the right of establishing martial law at her will and pleasure throughout England. She exercised the right of issuing commissions for the purpose of levying money in the shape of loans. She exercised, further, at the period to which I am alluding other rights of a most extraordinary nature. Many of these have been abolished by act of Parliament; others have fallen into desuetude; and where any of these privileges have not been exercised f or a long period of time-have never been exercised since the constitution took its present form-it appears to me that to make use of these precedents for the purpose of altering the composition of the Houses of Parliament is a gross violation of tho principles of the constitution. (Cheeis.) Now, my lords, it is my duty to point out in detail and to call your lordships' attention to the cases which are cited in support of the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown whichwe are now considering. I will not, in so doing, occupy any considerable portion of your lordships' time, hut it is essentially necessaiy that your attention shonld be directed to those cases, in order that you may arrive at a right conclusion upon the important subject nowunderyourconsidemtion. My lords, the first patent for the creation of _ peerage for life was issued in the reign of Richard H. In the first year of that reign the first of the cases which nre rehed upon in justiheation of the present exercise of the prerogative occurred. A peerage for life was granted to a foreigner named Guichard d'Angle, but that individual was, as a foreigner, precluded from sitting and voting in Parliament, and so, the grant being nugatory, the patent of creation was cancelled in the following year, and a pension of 1,000;. a-year was settled upon him as an equivalent for the loss of his dignity. It is quite clear that that individual never sat in Parliament, and that, as a foreigner, he had no right to do so, and, therefore, his case can have no bearing upon the question we are now discussing. Jfy lords, Richard Vere, Earl of Oxford, who, as your lordships will recollect, was the favourite of Richard IL, was created Marquis of Dublin forlife: but that case has not the slightest bearing upon the present question, nor does it in any way justify tliat exercise of the prerogative of the Crown to which I am calling your lordships' attention, because at the time when the Marquisate of Dublin was conferred upon Richard Vere he was entitled, as Earl of Oxf ord, to sit and vote in your lordships' house, and, therefore, did not in any way acquire that nght in consequence cf the additional title conferred upon him. There is * third caf? mA s*me te'8n similar in point of principle, and to which the same answer applies. A grant of a dukedom for hfe was granted to the King's nude, who was created Duke cf Aquitaice, but he was entitled to » seat in your lordships' house by virtue of his previous title of Duke of Lancaster. There vas, also, the-easeof the Duchess of Norfolk, who was made a peeress for hfe, but that can havo no atrolicafaon to the present c«e. I have now, my lordsf gone through the reign of Richard H.. a reiga which hS.oeen selected as the period from which-the best precedents m»T *c found for grantmgpeeraget in the form now incontemclition, and-none of the cases which I have cited appear to mj£> appiy to the case we are now considering.

PH 11 iTiIMORE gave notice that on an early day he should caU attention to the injustice and inecjuality of the present mode of assessing the cleigy to parochial rates. VICTORIA ORDER OF MERIT. Captain SCOBELL said, the question he had placed on the paper had been most satisfactorily answered by the pubUcafaon of the warrant establishing the Victoria Order of Merit. (Hear, hear.) With the permission of the noble lord he would submit another question-whether information as to the rules and regulations would be printed for the use of members? Lord PALMERSTON thonght the warrant coatained everything that was necessary. If the hon. gentleman would teU him what further infonnation was needed, he would ascertain if it could be given. INSPECTION OF PRISONS (HOME DISTRICT). Mr. ADDERLEY asked the Secretary of State for tho Home Department, why there had been no report made by the Inspector of Prisons in the home district for five five yeais past; and when any report, such as the act requires annuaUy, was likely to be made by that inspector ? Sir G. GEEY regretted to say that the Inspector of Prisons in the home district was five annual reports in arrear, directly contrary to the terms of the act of ParUament, which required that the reports should bemade ann--iy. For months past he had endeavoured to impress on Captain WiUiams the necessity of making up those reports, and, ihough Captain WiUiams had given repeatedassurancesthat he would do so, none of the reports had yet bcen received Measures had been taken effectnaUy to prevent the recurrence of such neglect, and to insure regularity in future. THE CRIMEAN ARMY. Sir J. FEEGUSSON said, the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the SuppUes of the British Army in the Crimea having appeared, he begged to ask the UnderSecretary of State for War, whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to make any change in thedirection of that department; and whether it was their intention to place that department of an army in the field under the charge of a superior miUtary officer, as recommended by the said commission t Mr. PEE1 said, the suggestion referred was that a staff officer should be appointed to deten-ine how tiie anny should be suppUed, and the nature of those suppUes; and: the'effect would be to devolve upon such an officer the most: lmportaat part of the duties of the Commi-aiy-Geneial, and a portion of the duties of the Quartermaster-General; The suggestion appeared to bo a valuable one, but it had not yet been determined to act upon it. IRISH MEDICAL CHARITIES. In reply to Mr. Maodire, Mr. HORSMAN said, the Government were not prepared with any bilif or the better regulation of the Medical Charities oflreland CORRUPT PRACTICES AT ELECTIONS. Mr. H. BERKELEY begged to ask the First Loid of the Treasury the foUowing question :-Seeing that the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act expires this session, and that a strong and general opinion prevails as to its inefficiency, whether it is the intention of HerMajesty-s Government to bring in a bfll to renew that act, or to submit its operation to the. mquiry of a select cominittee 1 lord PALMERSTON said, the question was stfll under the consideration of the Government. They had not yet made up their minds whether it was best to bring in a bfll to continue or amend, if necessary, the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, or to propose to refer.the subject to the consideration of a select committee. When they had made up their minds he would infonn the House whai course * they would adopt. FOREIGN F_-_BTM3SNT. Mr. H. BATTiTiTE said-I wish to ask the First lord of the Treasury, whether he has any objectioa to lay on the table of the House the correspondence which has taken place with the Prussian Government, relative to the employment of agents for the enlistment of troops, and in reference to the arrest of Her Majesty's consul at Cologne upon the charge of being engaged in suoh proceedings ; also any communications which may have been made by the authorities of the Hanse Towns with referenco to-, tho subject of enlistment? - - lord PALMERSTON.-I certainly shaU object to produce to the House the correspondence"\ with regard to; our consul at Cologne. There were charges brought against Mr. Curtis which Her Majesty's Government had good reason to beUeve were supported by evidence not. entitled to credence. A great deal of .communication passed between Her Majesty's Government and the Prussian Government. The trial at Cologne and the condemnation of Mr. Curtis foUowed, which, in our 'opinion, was not just; but wo could not expect the Prussian Govemment to, acquiesce in -our opinion, as they were entitled to place.confidencein the judgment of theirown tribunal Nevertherless, as a matter of courtesy towards Her Majesty's Government, the King of Prussia pardoned Mr. Curtis as soon-as tha final sentence of the court was deliveri-d. ' The correspondence involved a good deal of controversy. The transaction has ended satisfactorily and amicably, and I think no publio advantage would arise, but the contrary, from hying the papers on the table of the house. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the othsr Question, the.**e. dopt a motion for referring the patent to a Committee riyileges and that in terms which prejudge theques- dopt a motion for referring the patent to a Committee riyileges and that in terms which prejudge theques-

- NDO)V. FRIDAy,-FiuiBuARY 8, 1856. The House of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock. Lord LmnDmsr moved that the letters patent purporting to ereate Sir J&~rns Ph a Baroxn ofthe united, kIngdom for life be referred to the Caomitte,e of Privileg,e, wvith directions to consider thv same and. report thereon. The motion, bis Lfordship said, was of great irqMtance, as it reI ferred to the constitution of the peerage. In i,ring- ing it-forward he had no personal objection to Slt- J. PARKE, whom he had himself recommended for promotion to the judicial bench, and whose abilities and impartiality as a judge he varmly eulogized. The position he laid dowvn was, that no mstance had occurred in the history of this- country for 40v) years of any commoner being raised to a seat in the House of Peers by letters patent creating onily an estate for life. There-had been a few cases of creation of Barons for life, but they were .marked by peculiar circumstances, and to make them the foundation of a change in the chayacter of the House and the customnof Parliament was a gross violation of the constitution. He cited ssenral of these cases, showing that they differed essentia'y from the present creation. One was that of a foreigner, who could not sit in Parliament; - others were baronies without the right of sitting. Ee urged, also, as an objection to these cases as pre| cedents, that they occurred in times of civil war and confusion, before the constitution of England had been formed and settled. Coming to a. laterperiod, he referredto thepeeragesforlifecreatedby CE[Ar.s some, of them hi favour of his mistresses, and others by JAmEs II. and the iirst Kin-gas of the House of Hanover, argiuing that the circumstances under which these dignities were bestowed were not such as to render them precedents for the creation of a peer of Parliament. Quitting the more strictly legal view of the question, Lord L-aiNDnuusT proceeded to show its impolicy. It would divide the House of Peers into two paits,-the peers by descent and the peers for life without succession, and remove the great check to an arbitrary creation of peers for any purpose of the Ccon i v hich was provided by the hered'itary principle of the U*per House. He denied the necessity for increasing the number of the law lords, on which the elevation of Sir J. PARED had been advocated. WVrits of error were of rare occurrence, and on important points of common law the House had the powver of sunumoning the tvelve judges to assist it when sitting as the supreme coiut. He contended that no class of men had done more to build up and defend the constitution of the country than members of the legal profession, and it was invidious to - place theni below those who were rewarded for other kinds of public services. Earl GRANvLTE acknowledged the vigour and ability of Lord LInNWHUrS's speech, but tontended that he had mixed up the questions of prerogative, right, and expediency, while he had never ventured distinctly to deny the legality of the creation of a peerage for life. Lord GnAN%cE believed thatthe measure was more opposed by the law lords than by other peers. Lii 1851 a life peerage was offdred to an eminent judge, who declined it, alleging he was too much occupied to attend the hearing of appeals. But the real reason was, that an elevation to the peerage for life was unpopular with his legal brethren, and he would not be the first man to be an example of it. The cases cited by Lord LvxDnunsr from the reign of CIHRLES II. and the first years of the GEoROEs did not bear closely on the question, but they rather strengthened than weakened the arguments in favour of the patent, founded on the right of the CnowN. Lord GAi-viLvE quoted several authorities of recent date to prove the perfect legality of the creation of peerages for life-among them an admission by Lord CArDnELL. In fact, the lep,lity of such peeraaes had never been disputed; and, being in this case expedient also, it became constitutional. Somc accession of strength to the judicial portion of the House was absolutely required to maintain its efficiency, and there were grave objections to creating hereditary peerages, without ample means of supporting them. Theproposal to refer this patent to the Committee of Privileges was unusual; and, feeling as strongly as any one the wish to uphold the honour and dignity of the House, he would advise it to reject the motion. LordST.LEONARD'Ssupported themotion, because, by a creation. of peerages for life, the character of the House wvould be totally altered, and he strongly urged the Peers to maintain inviolate the hereditary principle. He cited a great number of cases, through a long period of history, to show that a patent of creation for life is illegal. The LoRD CiHAxmCmLo thought the House, in referring this question to the Conuittee of Privileges, might inadvertently destroy another principle and trench on the prerogative of the CnoTwi. It was a matter on which the House had no power or jurisdiction; - the -question could not come regularly jbefore it, unless some heir of Lord 1VENsmsnsrA hereafter claimed a right to a writ of summons to Parliament; it would then be for the House to examine the patent of creation, and decide vwhether he was so entitled to be summoned or not. He declared confidently that a patent for life was perfectly legal, quoting Lcrd CosxD in support of his opinion, and that authority had been endorsed by Sir MXTrBw HArE and every great lawyer of more recent times. He strongly objected to the legality and the expediency of the creation being nxixed up in one motion for reference to a committee. It was very desirable that high legal talent should have freeer access to the LegisLature than had been the case of late years. Such talent was required; but the expense of an hereditary digDity was an obstacle to obtaining it. The only mode of removing that difficulty was- by a grant of public money. But would that be thought advisable T A right that it was admitted had not been exercised for 400 years was not likely to be abused to the deterioration of the House. The real check to a misuse of the power was not the denial of the right, I but in that enlightened public opinion which would render its abuse impossible. Lord CAuirsrLL said the change about to be introduced in the constitution of the peerage was greater than that effected in the House of Commons by the Reform Bil, and it was to be made without ihe knowledge and assent of the peers, by a simple act of the CRowN. Precedents derived from periods since which centuries had elapsed were inapplicable to the present case. The cnly. precedents of value were those which had arisen since the English constitution had settled into its present form. Several of the precedents xeferred to by previous speakers Lord CAsrBELL again noticed, to show that the creation of a peer did not necessarily confer a seat in the Legisla1ture. As the House of Lords fully represented public opinion, a change in its constitution was not required. He did not think any addition to the I law lords was called for; on any point of difficulty or importance it had the power of summoning the judges to assist it by advice. Ee protested against a ,step that would be unjust to lawyers as a class, unless jthe principle were extended to other professions. It would be a precedent for depriving future Lord Chancellors and Chief Justices of peeragees for life, and to that he could not consent. Earl Gr. thought the question had been unduly exaggerated; it was not a total change of the constitution of the House; he believed the character and influence of the House would not be lowered by a more frequent creation of peerages for' life. Eminent members of the other House of Parliament j-men who had distinguished themselves in the public service-might fitly be so rewarded. Confining the access to the peerage to the one avenue of an hereditary dignity, only to be supported by large fortunes, was really an exclusion of talent and merit. Hle warned the House against referring the cuestion to a cdmmittee of privileges, which was "a committee of the whole House. It could not decide the point; it it could reject the patent, the Eouse could not refuse a writ owa smons; as far as the seat in that House was concerned, the patent -was a nullity; presenting himself with a writ of summons from the Cxown, Lord WEsLEySn.s must 'be admitted. He deprecated any oollsion on this question with the CxowH, backed by the House of Commons. The Earl of P)eanr contended that the patent for life involveania organic change in the whole consti- tutionh he House, and that in referring it to they5mittee of privleges they were takint the ,aost moderate and practical course. Any change in the onstitation of the Hoise should be made by a distinctlaw, not by a mere act of the CatowM. In the hands of an unsc ulous Minister that power of the :Prefogativd would be rught with danger to the independence of the House; and if the principle were carried out to all its consequences, the hereditary -peeragoe would .be .scrificed to the hereditary monarchy. He fully concurred in the motion. The Duke of AA.Ynr. alluded to the plan for Iswamping tl4 House of Peers in 1832, to prove that there w as much danger from the undisputed poworof the CowA .to create hereditarypeerages as from the rigl of creating them for life. The de- I1al of that right might in tinio, of agitation lead to a recldess use of the lvrger powevR Lord BBOUTGA explained the part he took in the triansactions of 1832, and declared that life peerages -were inexpedient and incompatible with thesafety of the conistitution. The House then divided Contents .. Non-contenits ~ ... ... 53 Majority ... .... ... 26 Contents .... ... 59 Non-contents ... ... 52 Majority ... . ... The motion therefore was carried. The House then adjourned, at a quarter to 3 o'clock. In the House of Commons, Mr. COLLIR, in moving for leave to introduce a biU to transfer the testamentary jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts to the superior courts of common law and to the County Courts, observed that when he considered that these courts had been condemnmed by a commission more than 20 years ago, that this condemnation had been confirmedby'the unanirnous voice of public opinion, and that, although 15 bills had been introduced to transfer theirjurisdiction, they had all failed, it might be apprehended that these courts were destined to live for ever. His first. pr6oosition was, that it was necessary that the Ecclesiastical Courts should be abolished; but his bill dealt with only a portion of their jurisdiction-nam'ely, the testamentary, which was, he said, a pure usurpation; and he described the anomalies, embarrassments, delay, and expense attending its exercise-evils which, he thought, it was high time to put an end to. His next proposition was, that there was no necessity for any new tribunal,, but that the existing courts were sufficient to deal with this jurisdiction, for he denied that it required peculiar courts or a peculiar set of practitioners. He proposed that every uncontesteX wiU should be proved in the County Court where the testator dwelt (thus getting rid of the rule of bola Iotabilia), and that it should not be necessary to employ a proctor or ,n attorney, but that any man m night go to the Registrar's office and prove the will at once, without expense; that wvhere the property was under 3001. the County Court should decille every dispute raised upon the vwill; and that where the property exceeded 3001. the superior courts of conunon law should determine all questions relating to the validity of wills of personal as well as real property, the Court of Chancery retaining its jurisdiction over executors and trustees. The motion was seconded by Mr. HADEJELD, who enlarged upon the alleged abuses, as well as complications and expense, connected with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Mr. G. DTu was certain that the bill was Eo cruide that it would not -work beneficially. The SoLrwiToR-Gz,EP.AL said he should be sorry to offer any opposition to the motion; he was too much mortified at the failures he had e.xperienced to reject any assistance. At the same time Mr. CoaLisun must not consider his measure sufficient for the purpose in view. The Government had determined to bring in a measure this session, not to pul down one branch of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction alone, but for its entire and utter abolition. M\r. H. KEk=G spoke in favour of the objects of the bill. He hoped the testamentary jurisdiction would not be transferred by the Government measure to the Court of Chancery. MIr. MIa;s, on the other baud, was of opinion that nothiung could be more unwise than to transfer that jurisdiction to the courts of common law. It should be transferred neither to the. Court of Chancery, the superior courts of commonlaw, nor the County Courts. but to a court of exclusive jurisdiction over testamentary matters-a coiurt of probate. Mr. ATEIroTON approved the bill, believing that the tribunals to which it was proposed to transfer the jurisdiction were most competent to exercise it. Mr. R. PHnrioRE accused MIr. COLI= of grave and gross exiggeration and of inaccuracies, observing that it was not fair thus to mislead the HBouse. He hoped, if the Government broughEt in the measure promised by the SoLIOrroR-GENmAL, they would do so with a resolution to pass it. Mr. Mu-rz supported the motion. Sir E. Pm}y was of opinion that, while contentious jiurisdiction in testamentary matters, within a limitedamount, should be given to the County Courts, there should be a court of probate, with a Quxs{'S judge, in the muetropolis. Mr. IdZMAuON supported the motion, and recommended that the bill should be extended to Ireland. Mr. J. P.Hmia-onE deprecated piecemeal legislation upon this subject, and rejoiced at the prospect of the comprehensive measure promised by the Government. After a short reply from Mr. Comiir, leave was given to bring in the bilL Captain SCOBiPLL moved for a select committee to inquire into the naval administration, patronage, promotions, and retirements, and the efficiency of the service in all the grades. In support of the motion he reviewed aud rephed to the objections offered by the First Lord of the Adimiralty to the same motion last session; he condemned the policy of placing a civilian at the head of the Admiralty; he insisted that under the present system there were promotions made through favouritism and influence ; and, after reading various opinions of public men condemnmatory of that system, and an enumeration of officers in different grades whose professional advancement he considered had been impeded, he strongly impressed upon the Government the importance of vigilant attention to the efficiency of the navy and to the interests of all classes in the service. He left the question, he said, in the hands of the House. If a committee was granted, he felt assured that there would be ample evidence of the ungenerous manner in which naval officers had been treated. The motion was seconded by Admiral WAcoTr. Sir C. WooD resisted the motion, on the ground that, unless good and substantial reasons were assigned for suchan inquiry, it would be highly inexpedient, since it would interfere with the different departments and with public business; and he contendedthat no suchreasons had beenproduced. He entered into details, and calculations to show that erroneous conclusions had been drawn by Captain ScoBnur. Assertions of partialityandfavouritism,he observed, were very easily made. If rotation was -the rule 6f promotion, inefficiency crept into the service; if the principle of selection was admitted, which gave the best officers, it must always be open to charges of favouritism. In no appointment he had made had he suferedpoltical bias to influence him; and he had promoted no officer without the full concurrence and recommendation of tlhe Naval Lords of the Adnmiralty on professional grounds. He appealed to the services of the navy in the present war (warmly eulogizing those services), as furnishing a testimony in favour of the existing system.' Sir CTARTES proceeded to reply to specific allegations by Captain ScosBm; and, with respect to the constitution of the Board of Admiralty, nine-tenths of the business, he remarked, mightjust as well be done bv a civilbn as by a naval officer. B3elieving that the state of the navy was the best test of the system of naval administation, he affrmed that it never had been in tune of war in a state of greater efficiency. ColonelBoLDwno supported the motion, because an inquiry by a committee would test the merits of the existing system, and could do no harm. He drwelt at some length upon the unequal and unfair manner in which the naval department of the navy was dealt with in comparison with that of the army. 1 Sir M.. BERKELEY disputed the allegation that favouritism prevailed in the navy. WitA reference to opinions he had entertained when out of office, he avowed that since he had had experience of the Admiralty he had altogether changed those opinions. , Mr. W. S. LMNsSY supported the motion, main-taining that there were sufficient reasons to justify !dinqui. le stated facts which, he thought, should deter the House from refusig a committee. !lYlr. As aid Sir.

IMr. OsBouNz, in reply to Sir ). Narns, accused him- of interpolating a speech intended, to be mads on-his own motion. Captain SCoB3EL replied; and, v Upon a division, the motion was ntgatived by 171 to 80. MIr.

Mr. PEiArT had leaie to introduce a bMi to amend the provisions of the Marriage Acts relting to Dissenter. The House of Commons' Ofrices Bill was read a second time, after some remarks by Sir H. Wu. LOurGEBY and Lord PAImRE5TON- The Metropolitan Police Bil1 passed through coannut'tee. The Houseadjourned at a quarterpast 12 'ciock.
The House of Lords had last night the very great treat of a splendid exercitation on a constitutional theme by our oldest and ablest Conservative lawyer. It was impossible to listen to Lord 1 75'nunsT's review of the precedebts anticipated foi the creation of a peerage for life without following him to the conclusion that the measure is at least a stretch of the prerogative. It may be granted that every single precedent is faulty, either in respect of the times, or in some great speciality of circun. stances, or in the manifestly objectionable characters of the persons ennobled, or the more general objection that in order to prove the pow er of the prerogative we nmust go back to a period when its power was almost indefinite, and must therefore prove too much for our purpose. But, while the attempt to establish the perfectly constitutional character of the recent creation may thus end in proving too much, we must say that Lord LYoul`nUs3?s own ine of argument proved too much. in another direction. He established most satisfactorily that we had no alternative whatever but to remain in a position not merely difficult, incon-- venient, and scandalous, but practically intolerable, admitted to be so long ago, and becoming worse every year. That position is, that while the House of Lords very naturally clings to its appellate jurisdiction, and Lord LvxDnunsv would certainly denounce as an outrage on the constitution any attempt to relieve it of the burden; and while the law Peers very properly resent the intrusion of the lay Peers on what becomes, pro tem7pore, the seat of justice, the highest legal tribunal of the countiy dwindles into the casual attendance of one dr two law Peers, generaUy far advanced in years, who may or may not know anything about the question or the law upon which it turns. The House of Lords, as a court of appeal, no longer commands the respect of the country, and, except in some very rare cases, its decisions are only the mere solemn aflirmation of t:hejudgmenttpronounced in the court below. Could the House of Lords be persuaded to give up this tmnction to a bodyrcally competent to discharge ittheJudicialCommitteeofPrivyCouncil,-thatwould give us, in exchange for a constitutional pageant, a solid security for justice. But Lord LyhNDainsr does not advise this, and certainly the change would have much the same unconstitutional look as that under consideration. Indecd, the peculiar aifficulty of the question is that it is a constitutional one. The constitution must be'stretched, or settled by a " declaratory" measure, to use a Parliamentaryphrase, one way or another; and what we have to consider is whether the creation of legal peerages for life be not the least objectionable measure for the purpose. No doubt, an immediate remedy is found for the difficulty by summoning lawyers to the House of Lords ; but the process isnot carried on far enough to answer its purpose, and, as' far as it does go, is productive of grave inconveniences. The law is fast becoming the only channel to the peerage, to the obstruction of other old channels. There is now a large class of commoners in the country, of. such -wealth and position, such character, such territorial power and social influence, that they would rather strengthen the peerage than derive any additional consequence from it. Certainly it is very expedient that soma of this native strength of the country, the spontaneous growth of her industry, her genius, and her domestic virtues, shoulld be infused into the peerage, and the Lords would be all the stronger, the Commons rather more tolerant of their priority, for such an infusion. But the benches of the Peers, or rather the roll of the peerage, is so full, that no more Peers can be. made;- and, in fact, there are very few creations except the law Peers. We have no wish to. mention names.' There is not a single lawyer in the House that we are not glad to see there. But, when we look from the Peer to the peerage, from the man to the family now founded, we must say that we coulld select many a family from the rank of British conamoners which we would rather see permanently added to the peerage than those forced upon it under existing circumstances. The ï¿½9eling is so general as notoriously to produce a certain leaning of a not very agreeable character in favour of lawyers -without families, and it is a matter of notoriety that a distinguished lawyer whi eithei is not married, or too old to hava children, is more likely to have a peerage than a man tolerably certain to transmit the honour. Such calculations are very ridiculous, but they are a natural consequence of the constitutional scruple Lord Ly.Danunsr insists on. Granting, as we are ready to do, that the difficulty has been met by a stretch of the prerogative, at least, by an extraordinary revival of its original powers, we can only say that these offences against the constitution are not so uicommon. Lord GREY may have hesitated to create life peerages, but' he did quite as strong a thing in calling some twenty eldest sons of Peers from the Commons to the Iords, and, indeed, in his other large creation of Peers. Again, for about a thousand years, much further back than LordLvrDHURsT went last nightit has been unconstitutional for auEnglishBishop noï¿½ to have a seat in theHouse of Lords,yet we have come to see aBishop without a seat; indeed, as if in order to disabuse the Bishops of their constitutional prejudices, they are aRl made to pass through this, most unconstitutional stage of existence. A representative peerage is a' very unconstitutional idea, certainly very foreign to English usages, yet we have consented to see the Royal prerogative controlled by the suifrages of subjects, SD that when rEP. M&Ass has made a peer, as in Ireland, he cannot sit in the House of Lords unless his fellow Peers send him there, while in Scotland they have even the power of depriving him of his seat. In the case of the Irish Bishops the seat which conat!tutionally it is H1i M&mTes to give outright is held in rotation. In these cases it will beB saild Parliament made itself responsible for thbe alteration ,- but that does not prevent the -altera-' tion being of an unconstitutional character, as much so, indeed, as: if Parliament were now1o. adopt a suggeastion "once thrown o ult by ILord Buo1uJGr, and reduce the House of Lords itself to the constituent of a select worlki ing chamber. In e preent instance' - iewould not have teen exprPedient to go to Parlia&4 ment for the change. To do so would have been an admission' that the CRowN- could not iale the change out of tho fulneas of the 'prerogative, 9nd that admission would have been! mofe unt cnDtitu-. -tional thaZn the course actually adopted. It is quit
The latter part of the Commissioners? Report on 'the AIrmy before Sebastopol is devoted to recom- ne,rdations, most of which will probably be adopted. But, before giving advice fort the future, they continue the narrative of what had actually taken place. Some of the deficiencies which they ToInt out are even now inexplicable. When the fOOiPa were sent out proper exertions seem to have been made to supply them with an adequate number of tents and marquee. A favourite argument with military men is that the army was from the frSt insufficiently provided, through deference to the economical outcries of some popular politicians, and that the departments could not supply the matelials of subsistence or comfort, simply because they did not exist. Now, a short reference to the paragraphs headed " Tents" and " Sea Transport"' in Sir J. 'NErmr.'s report will show how unfounded is such an argument in relation to one great cause of suffering. We learn from -the report that each regiment took out tents -for the full eztablishment, although many were considerably below it, and that in the beginning of December the number of tents was more than -equ3l to one fourth of the numerical force then present. A similar liberality marked the prepara-tions for casualties or sickness. Each regiment, -whether of cavalry or infantry, took out at least -one hospital marquee with it, a few were sent out iin the waggons of the Ambulance Corps, and a reserve of 0 afterwards. " Altogether there "could not have been fewer than 120 hospital "marquees in possession when the force left "for the Crimea." Now, what is the state -of things when the conflicts of Inhermann and the trenches had caused hundreds to look - for surgical aid, when sickness was daily thining 'the ranks, and a period of rain was being sac-ceeded by the bitter cold of mid-winter? "In " the end of the year, it appears from the report "of the Medical Commissioners, that there were "Conly 37 marquees with the whole force." What, - then, had become of more than 80 ? The answer in decisive :-" The regiments, it is said, Ieft their "marquees w.th their heavy baggage at Varna, "beyond which we have been unable to trace I "them. It is said that a large quantity of stores w" were lost or abandoned there after the removal "of the troops, of which these may have formed "a part, but we are without any decided evi- "dence to that effect." It will be seen that the sfferings Nvhich the medical men so much " di" lated upon" were in a great measure caused - by articles so necessary as hospital tents having teen "lo3t or abandoned" with other stores, and so utterly forgotten that the Commnisioners could find no one who knew anything about them. Yet, although the British army, like the French, ileft some heavy baggage behind at Varna, could it not have been, as in the case of our allies, brought afterwards over the short distance which separated the Crimea from Bulgaria ? In the pas.sages relating to transports it is told, as it has often been told before, that vessels hired at 1?. per ton per month wvere used as stores, so that the country was paying rent at the rate of 12,0001. a-year for each s'ip employed as* an indifferent storehouse. Yet one of these transports, thus misapplied, could have in ten days left Balaklava, embarked every marquee at Varna, and again landed them in the reighbourhood of the camp. But probably General AmEr only troulbled hImself about the "C camp equipments" of those who were well, for we do not hear of even his favourite resource, " a " requisition on the Commissary-General," to .supply a shelter, for the want of which so many were perishing. TUnder the heading " Shelter for Horses" the Commissioners are as severe on the two commanding officers of cavalry as their habitual caution will permit them to be. The hutting of the -cavalry began in no case before the end of January; but they point out that the men 'were within a mile - of the store where wood might be obtained, that they had no work in the trenches, that the only -duties of horses and men were to carry up their own forage, or occasionally to bring down sic,l; and then say that "it is strange that more rapid progress was not made in obtaining hut accom" modation." There also seems to have been, inthe opinion of the Commissioners, " a want of promp" titude and ingenuity in devising some means "of temporary shelter, such as saved the baggage "horses of the Sappers and Mliners at Balaldava." Experience had shown that a very moderate degree of shelter wouldl have been sufficient to save the lives of many horses; and they conclude that the .scheme was practicable, since, aa we pointed out yesterday, the Colonel of the Scots Grays had actually offered to provide some such cover. " But," say they, " the manner in which the " proposal was received by the Lieutenant-Colonel " commanding the cavalry was calculated to deter " other officers fiom making any similar proCc pos a" With respect to the Mredical Department, Sir J. M'Nm.En and his colleague have much to say, and, -though they exonerate the individual surgeons from any charge of neglect, and speak in just praise of -their devotion, they bear witness to the general deficiencies and the confusion, which prevented ready acce even to what had been provided. The statement3 of our correspondents are here again fully corroborated by evidence from all sides. Oeneral CoDRINoroN tells the Commissioners, " The "hospitals suffered dreadfully. Their state was fiightful,from the increasing number of sick, the sdininiahing means of transport, and the conse"quent impossbtility of doing anything for the aiclk." The Inspector-General, Dr. - L, is blamed by the Commission for not having tsze~ greater pains to procure supplies froma 'utari, and it cannot be doubted that zfSnr delays. occurred vwhich maj expose him to censure; but it must- be remembered that at cutari, to hicth " about half of the aimy"' went dowi- xick, there was a confusion and helpleasness which raade an- dependence .6a its authorities certain to end in disappointment. Into the. 31ospitas of the Bosphorus the Commissioners diiIgxot ingluire, but they sate zufficient to shoj that no deecriptions yet given can be called " highly "coloured." If in theCrimea therc- was "a great ï¿½C deficiency of mattresses," and " late in April "many of the sick, in front had no other " edin- than blankets and buffalo rotes," -if they suffered from want of space and attendance, and, " owing to the want of marquees, "the geater part lay in circular tents," their condition at Scutari and Kululee was not so much better that these hospitals could spare much from their own wants for the relief of suffering before Sebastopol. Into the recommendations which fil1 the last pages of the report we shall not at present enter. Our aim has been chiefly to point out what two unbiassed inquirers, acting under the highest authority, saw and heard of those matters which have been so long and earnestly discussed. We have confined ourselves strictly to the evidence received and the conclusions drawn by the Commissioners; we have adduced no corroborating testimony, although it abounds on every side; we have blamed none but those whom they have blamed, all the more severely because with caution and perhaps with unwillingness. If we ask for the judgment of the Government and country upon some who are most deeply implicated, it is only because justice and sound policy demand that disasters known to be ternble, followed by an inquiry allowed to be impartial, shall not be forgotten lest the remembrance riight affect a few delinquents who have high place and influential connexions. The appearance of these reports is, indeed, a crowning tribute to the course which this journal has for more than a year past steadily followed. Altihough well knowing that al we published was literally true, and would be conirmied by examination and time, we hardly looked for corroboration so speecly, so universal, and so complete. We would now ask if any justification is wanted for those who gavo to their countrymen the inteligence of these calamities, and the warnings which prevented theen from being far more fatal? Nay, w.ould any censure have been too severe on men who, professing to give information, should have been parties to the 3eeping of such disgraceful secrets ? It has been caid that the press has no means of intelligence not open to the world; that a correspondent C.an know no more of what passes in a capital or a camp than any traveller who should make it his business to inquire. It has consequently been argued that the knowledge of official and military men in such events as those we have discussed must be accurate and their opinions decisive. Yet what proof have we seen of the existence of this exclusive information? Is it in the series of assertions madce by 31inisters a twelvemonth since, the denials which they reiterated with confidence and affected indignation, but all of which they have since been obliged to retract, or soften, or explain away? Is it in the despatches of the Commander-in-Chief, who seems to have been ignorant of the state as well as the resources of his own army ? Is it in the reports fromi Scutari, proved to be misrepresentations of the grossest kind? The first and most effective warnings, the narratives now known to be the most accurate and trustworthy, were indeed furnished by men who had no peculiar sources of information, but who at least had common honesty, common discernment, and sufficient courage to disregard calumny and the accusation of untruth. To the press the country owes it that the horrors now at length confessed are not at this moment as rife as a year ago.
In the ease of CouRIGaN, the wretched man w,ho murdered his wife in the Minories, the jury .on Wednesday, with little hesitation, returned a verdict of "Guilty." The plea of insanity was not admitted. C}nBTFs WEsTRos, on the other hand, the clerk -who shot MIr. WAuTGE last month in Bedford-row, has escaped under the sme pleathat is to say, the jury found 'him guilty; but recommended him to mercy, on account of his strong predisposition to insanity. . Under these circumstances Mr. Justice WiGnarAs, after consultation vith Mr.. Justice Wvms, did not pass sentence of death upon the prisoner, but ordered judgment of death to be recorded. This is equivalent to the admission of the pleas, and the prisoner will, no doubt, be detained for the remainder of his days in a mad: house. Vhat is insanity ? The subject defies definition; yet some sort of definition we must have. Here is what Justice WIGnHrTsA told the jury in ConnGAo's case :-" It is my duty to "tell you that before you can come to the con"clusion that the prisoner is not responsible on the ground of insanity you 3nust be satisfied "that at the time the act was committed the pri"soner -was labouring under such a defect of "reason as not to know the nature and quality "of the act he was committing." This definition answered the purpose of convicting COURGAN; yet, in truth, we scarce see how a beastly sot, who had drunk himself into a state of frenzy, can exactly be said to have been aware "of the nature and value of the act he was com"mitting." We do not quarrel with the conviction, for the man was rightly convicted, but with the definition of insanity. A man in a frenzy of passion, or in a fit of intoxication which turns to violence, cannot, with any propriety, be said to be of soundly iudging mind. We will not pretend to substitute any definition of our own for that of the learned Judge, nor have we ever seen in any work on forensic jurisprudence, or in the charge of any Judge, any formal definition upon this point against which exception could not be taken. Fortunately for precision of judgment, no very nice question of sanity or non-sanity arose in COnBIGAN'S case. It was simply that of an habitual drunkard, who, in a fit of frenzy and violence, superinduced by drink, killed his vife by stabbing her. There was no posifive evidence to show that-the man had ever laboured even under delirium tremens. Mms E &- B}r FMnoc had beard that he had suffered from this disease. I1r. Coos, the medical witness in the case, who examined the unfortunate woman's body after death, in answer to questions, from the cross-examining counsel, returned some very proper answers upon the 'nature and effects of the disease, but he did not state that the prisoner was affected by ddiidum fremenis. He knew nothing of his habits-he never saw him until the time of this transaction. The counsel for the defence, in the exercise of their discretion, would not, or froa ignorance of the symptoms could not, put to him those questions which would have elicited the fact of whether or not he was labouring under an attack of this disease when seen "by 3Mr. CoOx. In this case the usual proceeding of producing mad-doctors was not resorted to-it was probably felt that the attempt would be useless, and 31r. BA iNrnm was driven to rely upon his own tact and skli for extracting a mitigated sentence from the jury. His endeavour was to show that the act had been committed under the influence of " uncontrollable "impulse," and could only be accounted for onthe supposition that the prisoner was not in. hisright ienses at -the time the act was committed. this is just the old story, and we are happy to -see that for once a plea was not available which might be pleaded ii defence or in extenuation of any crime. - . - The case- of WxsTgoxt waz somewhast different, and nb dousbt there was sn9ient ervdence to hliow that tliere vere qmpt6m -of' what medical men would ctll insanity existing in his cse. The verdiet of the jury is, however, equally an aubmaly in I rhiminAl proceedig, andoncewhich we fear-will be of it eXiIlprecedent:-"Wefind thie prisoner "guilty of wilful murder; we do not think he ought "to be acquitted on the ground of insanity, but we "recommend him to mercy because in his case we "find there werestrongpredispositions toinsanity." In our opinion, nothing can be a greater mockery of all the solemnities of justice than the conclusion of thistrial. The jury recommend the prisoner to mercy because they find in his case that which should have enititled him to an acquittal ; but, notwithstanding, they find him - guilty. The Judge then, according to the time-honoured practice, causes sentence of death to be recorded against the prisoner, although it is a perfectly well understood matter that it is not to be carried into effect. Surely all this is absurd in the highest degree. As far as the jury are concerned, they should have either had the courage to acquiit, or the firmness to condemn. As it is, here is an easy loophole of escape provided for the qualms and cruples of jurymen. They will not set the dictates of their consciences at defiance, they will not openly violate their oaths, they will satisfy justice by pronouncing a prisoner guilty, and by the next breath of their foreman relieve their minds and stultify their own conclusion. It is highly tobe desired that this modem innovation should be nipped in the bud. By all means let the jury retain their privilege of recommending a prisoner to mercy, and let the Judge, as in old times, second or oppose the recommendation. The opinion of the Judge who tries the case is the best rule for the guidance of the SzoCBTAnR of STATrX, who has to consider the application for mercy. According to this new proceeding, the opinion of the Judge literally counts for nothing. If the verdict of "Guilty, but re"commended to mercy onx the ground of predis"position to inity," be interchangeable with "Not Guilty, on the ground of insanity," the office of the Judge is purely ministerial. Nothing remains for him but to cause the sentence of death to be recorded, and to hand over to the lunatic asyluni a man who has just been foumd guilty of wilful murder and of sane mind at the time that murder was committed by his hand.
SECOND EDITION. THB TIBES OFFICU, Friday. Thrning. GERMANY AND THE PEACE PROPOSITIONS. (BY SUiMARE ANaD BBITIS TlEGRAlBH) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Berlin correspondent:- "BERLI, Fa 8. " The Austrian communication on the suabject of the Five Points accepted by Russia was yesterday presented to the Diet of Frankfort, and was referred to the respective Committees without dLicussion." SPAIN. We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- "PARIS, FRADAY, F. 8, 8.30 &ar. " A telegraphic despatch from Madrid, dated the 7th inst., announces the commencement of a changge in the Cabinet. ". L Bruil has left the MIinistry of Finances, and yesterday M. Francisco Santa Cruz took the oaths as Minister of Finances." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday 6 p.m.:- The day before yesterday, at noon, airived here from Vienna Colonel de Lowenthal, one of the Aides-de-Camp, to the Emperor of Austria, and inow cent as extraordinary courier to Paris. He left Vienna on Saturday last, and is the bearer of the protopol, as also of despatches for I. Hubner, the Austrian Aabassador at this Court. It is said that he remains here for some time. He announces that Count Buol will arrive in Paris on the 15th or 16th, and, as I mentioned yesterday, 31 de Bourqueney leaves Vienna this day. So confident are the Russians of peace that many who had been hitherto residing at Brossels have already come to Paris. The Ind0endcvance Beige publishes the followving letter, dated Warsaw, the Ist inst. - "Prince Paskiwitsch, lieutenant of the kIngdom of Poland, died this morning at 10 o'clock, after a long and painful illness. This event, although expected for somi weeks, has nevertheless produced general consternation throughout the city. For the last 33 years of his goverm. ment of Poland the illustrious deceased commanded the affection, admiration, and gratitude of all those who had occasionto appreciate the greatqualities which distinguished him. At the moment I write an immense crowd of people is stationed in front of the chatean, where all the dignitar.es of the State, having at their head Count Krasinsld, who acts aslieutenantof the kingdom ad interin, areassembledto offertheexpression of their grief tothe widow andchildren of theViceroy. It appearathatbis remains areto be imnediately embalmed, and that after remaining exposed several days in the Catholic church, they will be conveyed to Homel, in Volbynia, and deposited in the family vault of the Prince. It is not knownwho is to succeed him. To-day, for the firat time, the trains of the Upper Silesia Railway are to arrive at Warsaw, accompanied by an officer of the Prussian Cus. loms, so that the inspection and other annoyances hitherto experienred at Granitza, on the frontier, ale done away with, to the great satisfaction of the merchants of'both countries." We read in the same journal, under date Hamburg, 3d February - " Notwithstanding the prospect of the speedy conclusion of peace, which we here consider as certain, the Englisa agents continue to enlist recraits in the different countries of the north, in virtue of fresh orders to that effect lately forwarded from London. Last week several boats, having on board a certain number of volunteers, left tho Elbe and the coasts of the North Sea for Heligoland, where the 5th Regiment of Light Infantry, in the pay of England, is being formed. In the mean time several German officers have re-, ceived commissions for the legion from the English 3inistry of War. Most of them formerly served in the army of the duchies of Holstein-Schleswig. The Government of Electoral Hesse hae taken proceedings against the officers, natives of the duchy, who have accepted commands in the Anglo-German legion. This measure is the more unac. countable, as everybody knows that at another period the same Government readily supplied England with thousands of H&isian subjects when she was eDgaged in awar with her revolted colonies of North America. The rfinter horsefairs in the north have been frequented by merchants from all the countries in Europe. Cavalry and artillery horses were purchased at higher prices than last year, and the number of those useful animals exported during the last tvo yeara is so considerable that very few are now tobe found in the country." - The Courrier de Marsetne contains accounts from the Crimea of the 22d ult. At that date rumours of peace circulated in the camp, but the official intelligence of the acceptance of the Austrian Tltilnladln, received the night. before at the headquarters, had not yet been made public. Two Cossacks had been taken prisoners by the French, but no satisfactory information ' could be obtained from them. They' merely stated that the enemy remnained entrenched- in their winterquarters, -and meditated no horfle movement. The fire from the northern forts was confined t4 a projectile thrown every quarter of an hour on the southern side of Sebastopol. All the- docks with the exception of one had hieen blown up., The weather was dry anld fine. Down to the 17th ilt. nothing ne* .had occurred at Enpat&ia. TheRussian continued immovable vithin their lines, and thi cold had lost much 'of its intensity. Thel embarcation of the Turkish-cavljry had -commenced on the 16th. One regiment only was to be left at Eupatoria. Letters from Kertch of the 20th uit. state that all apprehension-of an attack on the part of the Russian had vanidhed, - The conditieia o0 the place was excellent, provisions of every description were abundant, and the troops were in high spirits, and well prepared to meet the enemy. AletterfromKinburn,inthe (azeftednMidi, gives some details of the manner in which the engineers of the French navy took advantage of their vessels being blocked up before that place in the ice to fortify themselves against an attack:- " When we found that we were surrounded by thick ice, and, in fact, absolutely frozen in, we saw that in case of attack we should labour under a marked disadvantage, as not only we presented a fixed, mark for the enemny, but we dould be at any time attacked by their land forces in great numbers. The following plan was at last decided on:We determined to convert each veswel into a regular fortification, and as each fortified place ought to have a deep ditch around it, we resolved not to be wanting in ono either. Accordingly,all round each vesselwesawedawaytheiceat some distance, so as to place every vessel in a state of complete isolation. Every morning the first thing dbne was to break the ice close to the vessels, and re-establish the circle of water. Bridges wero thrown across from the stem and the stern, and at a mbment's notice these moveable passages could be drawn on deck. In various parts of the ice, also, we cut holes, which would certainly embarrass an approaching enemy, and these we took care to keep clear each day. We also at some distance off piled up the pieces of ice which we had cot away, and formed very strong barricades, calculated to arrest an assailing party for some time. We, besides, so placed our gans as to be able to sweep off any body of men approaching from certain points. We have no apprehensions, however, of an attack, for without any doubt the Russians have perceived us at work, and are aware of what we have been doing. They must, therefore, see the folly of any attempï¿½ to molest us." A telegraphic despatch from Constantinople, of the 4th instant, states that the Grand Visier, Auli Pasha, who was appointed Ottoman Plenipotentiary to the Conferences of Paris, was preparing to leave the Turkish capital; and that Mehemet Pasha, President of the Council of the Tanzimat, was to fill ad isdcrim the functions of Grand Vizier. General Ferrey, who commanded a brigade of cavalry in the Crimea, has returned to France in consequence of his promotion to the raik of General of Division. The General arrived at Marseilles on the 5th inst. in the Enphrate. The Turkish Ambasssador in France, Mehemet Djemil Bey, embarked at Marseilles on the 5th, for Genoa, in the packetHellespont. General della Muam=ora left Paris yesterday for the Crimea, to resume the command of the Sardinian army. The steam aviso Prom6thee arrived at Toulon on the 4th inst., coming from Greece, and on the 6th the steain aviso Eclaireur sailed from that port for Tripoli of Barbary. The war transports Marsouin, Licorne, and Expeditive enterecd therbourg on the 5th, coming from Indret, Brest, and Rochefort, and the brig of war Obligado on the 6th, from the Pacific Ocean. The corvette Galatie arrived at Brest, from the West Indies, on the 5th, and the screw transport Isere, of 1,2(D tons, from Rochefort. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received :- "YM-NNA, 3?e 6 z o. "IAccounts from Constantinople of the 28th state that the Sultan has approved of the plans of internal reform proposed at the Conference. All Christians are now eligible to fill public functions." "BEXRLIN, Fan. 6. "It is stated that Russia has declared that the participa. tion of Prussia in the conferences is a special question, entirely independent of the signature of the preliminaries of peace, and the solution of which may take place at a later period in the course of the conferences. "L etters fromr St. Petersburg state that the re-establish. ment of the episcopal sees, which had been Tpromised to the Pope by the Czar Nicholas, has not yet received the sanction:of the Emperor Alexander IL "COPBNHAGEN, FEB.4. "A conference has talen place between the delegates on the Sound Dues. Denmark has made a fresh proposition, asking for 36,000,000 of thalers, to be divided amuong those interested." "C HABURG, FEn. 7. "By R>oyal decree the criminal prosecution decreed against the Minister Scheele by the Holstein Diet is to be brought before the SuperiorCourt of Appealof that Duchy., "- MAA ID, EEn. G. "Tranquillity has been re-established. The Government bas decided on raising the state of siege of the provinces of Burgos and Aragon. It is thought that this measmre will v1so be applied to Catalonia." A work which will be found no unworthy contribution to the general mass of information on the war in the Crimea will issue from the Paris press on Saturday next. The author, the Baron de Bazancourt, published a small volume in July last, eiRtitled " Cissq lois dcvasrtS &asdopol," in the form of lettersfrom the French camp. The present work will have for title " L'lepedition de C,-isndc jusqu'a lo, prise de Scbastopol." The writer's avowed object in proceeding to the Crimea was to render an account of the occurrences that took place on the theatre of the war, and for which he was specially charged by the Mfinister of Public Instruction; and to facilitate his views he received letters of recommendation from the Minister at War to the Commander-in-Chief of the French forces. Be bears grateful testimony to the manner in which he was received at the camp, and for the opportunities afforded him of clhronicling its events. "The mission," he observes in the preface, W Was delicate and difficult, and I by no means under_ valued the obstacles which I should probably encounter, as it is always with apprehension that a public writer is received in camps. I removed the apprehension from the commencement, by explaining franldy to the Commander. in-Chief mry object, say intention, and the work for whicih I asked his protection; and I shall never forget the kindness cf General Canrobert to me. The tents were all open to me, and I received from the principal chiefs of the army a reception for which I shall ever feel grateful." - The same reception he met everywhere, among officers highest in command as well as among the lowest in rank. The following letter of recommendation was given i him by the Minister of War:- Dec. 28, 1854L "}L lo Baron,-On informing me that he has charged you withcollectingintheEasttheinformationnecessaryto describo the present war, the Minister of Public Instraction prayed rce to recommend yon to theCommander-in-Chief of our army. I complywith thewish of my colleagne, alithenore villingly that I myself attach great value to the success of a mission so nationql as the one he has conferred on you. He could not have made choice of a writer better qualfied for the subject he undertakes. Ihave, therefore, given orders that, according to your desire, a place shall be reserved for you in the packet that sails on the Sth January next. RIleceive, &c., "VAIILANT, Marshal, Minister ofSar." The volume which forms the first part, and the first sheets of which I have just seen, consists of i0) pages, and contains some interesting official documents relating to the wavr. - M. bollet Meygret, Director-General of Police;, has been absent from Paris lately for about a fortnight or three weeks. It was currently reported thaat he wvas occupied in discovering the traces of a' secret society which has considerable ramifications in some of the southern departments, and that he' had..made many and important arrests. *That arrests have been made is certain; but I doubt whether the absence'of the Director-General was' for a purpose which would not have required the presence of so high a functioiiary. On the contrary, it is whispered in some quarters that he was employed abroad oin a in isicui of a vory different and more agreeable kind, which required great.tact and 'judgment; and it -is further said that x. ColetWeygret has fully succeeded in his object. -The'last 'liqui4idtion" at the Bourse wasat- tended with -ednaiderable 'loss to many persons,;' .but, as often happens, -some' whb miost' suffered' were not those who' most deserved it.

The misadventure didnotcosthimnanuneasymoment. He assembled his creditors, and with the coolesteffontery informed them that he would pay 15 per cent. of his obligations to them, bit that he should keep 25,000f. to enable him to try ,is luck once more at the Bourse. It is not perceived that he has in consequence lost caste among the circle he moves in. The Case would be different if an unfortunate epicier had left the key under his door. Such scandals ara, I fear, of frequent oeï¿½urrence, and some day will rouse public indignation to a high pitch. The Assenzbl&e Vationale has received a first warning from the Minister of the Interior on account of an article published in its cols from the Vorr sl.jendanf, entitled, "Des Caractres de la Polcmilue 7CligqimsS aciuelle." The Moniteiur publshes a decree promulgating a convention of extradition just concluded between France and Austria. The Moiteutr contains decrees appointing one officer, one non-commissioned officer, and three privates to the rank of Knight ixx the Legion of Honour, and conferring the military medal on 32 privates. Other decrees confirn one promotion to the rank of Officerin the Legion of Honour, one nomination to the rank of Knight, and the grant of eight military medals made by Marshal Pelissier.

The Corriere Mercantile of Genoa publishes the instructions issued by the Minister of War at Turin, with the approval of the British Minister, concerning the Anglo-Italian Legion, when stationed in places having Sardinian garrisons, as is now the case at Novara. These instructions are, that the Sardiniman and Anglo-Italian troops are to exchange military salutes and honours when they meet; that the commandants of both corps are to agree on the necessary regulations for maintaining order and discipline; and that the hoins for parade and drill are to be arranged so as to prevent the two corps being in each other's way on the exercising ground. SPAS. - (FRoM oUR 4owN CORBZsPOxDxrr.) MTADRID, FK. 2. The Cortes have suspended their sittings till the 6th, i. e., over the Carnival days, 'when the discession of the bases of the Electoral Law will be resumed. The Government profess to regard this as an open question, though evidently leaning to a more restricted franchise than is desired by the majority of their Progresista supporters. Senor Sorni, one of the Uiltra-Progressistas, moved an amendment yesterday, which was opposed by the Committee on the Electoral Law, and voted against by aU the Ministers present, lbut it was taken into consideration by 102 votes against 100, and will be discussed whenthe sittings are resumed. It fixes the payment of taxes for the eeetoral franchise at 110 reals per annum, which the Committee consider too low. General O'Donnell sent in his resignation yesterday, in order that he might be able to bring his quarrel with Senor Orense to a conclusion; buat I believe the resignation has not been accepted, and that this disagreeable affair may now be considered as at- an end. Further Ministerial changes are spoken of. One report is that General Ros de Olano will leave the Direction-General of Infantry for the Lisbon Embassy; that General Zabala will take the former appointment, and will be replaced in the Foreign-office by Senor Escosura, and that Senor Corradi wmill seceed the latter as Minister of the Home Department. The adjournment of the sitting of the Cortes till the 0th maay give time for adjusting theMinisterial arrangements. In the mean time financial matters are looking up. It is thought that Senor Euil will take advantage of the buoyant state of the fumds to effect a settlement of the floating debt by converting tlhe Treasury paper which represents it into Three .per Cent. Stock, which he will issue at 40, i.., -250 stock for 100 floating debt. To-day being the festival of the Purification, is kept as a holyday at the Bolsa; but there is another rise of nearly one per cent out of doors, the Three per Cents. having been done at 38W, and the Deferred ditto for 24. There was a grand religious ceremony in the Royal chapel to-day, and this evening the Queen goes in state to the church of Atocha. It is folur years to-day since the attack was made upon her by Merino. The criminals who participated in the murder of the :Barcelona deputy and manufacturer, Senor Sol y Padris, have been convicted ; but, with the exception of the least gnuilty of them, they are all at large. Four have been sentenced to be garotted, two to work in chains for life, and one (now in custody) to two years' presidio. Senor Sol y Padris was a young deputy of great promise. Intelligence was received at our Leg-ation to-day of the death at Carthagena of Mr. Charles Walsingham Turner, British Consul at that place since. 1841,0_ WE;ST COAST OF AFRICA. (By Xq0=.i TEGRAPH.)

THE STATE OF TUKEY, . I -- -- rtlof the f6uowizg &PP.&ei ba ï¿½ doftlon CU0 .TINOPLE, JAY. 28. After the third coubtlvenco on the fourth point had taken plac.o between the representatives of England, Fiance, and Auitria on the one hand, thd the Grand Vizier and the Minister for ForeiDgn Affairs on the other, the forner, acting in concert, drew up a note, in which they embodied the general ideas and principles they wished to propose to the Turkish Government en this subject. Lord Stratford, who had taken the lead in this matter aUl along, drew up the original document, wvhich, after a few alterationa from his colleagues, was accepted by them, and in this amended form transmitted to the Porte on the 22d inst. This document, although only containing the general principles which, according to the Amninadors, ought to be followed in the amelioration of the condition of the Christians in Turkey, is of considerable length, and touches on many subjects 'which do not indeed directly beIong to this quesLion, but without the regulation of which it was not thought posible to make any permanent amelio,ration. I dare say the document will be printed and submitted to Parliament as containing a question interesting not only to England, but the whole of Europe; in the mean time, I will give you its most prominent points, as I have been able to ascertain them. The docunent begins by saying that the time has come when the Tturkish Government, in consideration of the services rendered to Turkey by the allies, as well as in its own well-understood interest, rhould make those changes in her internal institutions which on the one side might satisfy the wishes of Europe for improving the condition of the non?Mussulman subjects of the Porte, and on the other aide set at rest the just claims of so large a portion of the population, consolidate the Turkish empire, and make its further material and social development possible. After this introduction the first point touches on the general principle of equality between Mussulman and non-Mussulman subjects, and the security of their persons and property; it treats likewise of the position of foreigners in Turkey, especialy as regards their inability to hold property. The second point concerns the administration of justice. Separate tribunals are proposed for the Mussulman and non-Mussulman stlbjects. For mixed cases, where both MIussulman and nonMussulman are concerned, a mixed tribunal fairly constituted is recommended, and the right of all non-Mussulmans to come forward as witnesses demanded. In the original document it wvas even proposed to appoint a non-Mussulman adlatus to every Mussulman Governor, in order to protect the rights of the non-Mulssulman subjects inthis respect. Should a diversity of opinion arise between the two it was proposed that the matter should be referred to Constantinople. This point has, Ihear, been given up, after mature consideration, and very wisely too, it seems to me, for it would have been in contradiction with another point likewise recoinmended,-namely, the ability of non-M1ussulman subjectsto fill officialposts, bywhich theselatter could themselves become Governors. Besides, such a proposition, if carried, would throwthe whole provincial jurisdiction into the hands of the Council at Constantinople, for it is hi*ly probable that in every case the two Governors would take a contrary view of the disputed question. The next point regards the police of the empire on an extended and improved scale. Another, the development of the agricultural, industrial, and conumercial resources of the country, roads, canals, railroads, imports and exports, and the regulation of commerce, and finishes with alluzions to the undoubted desirability of an improved financial system. The next point touches on education, schools elementary as well as superior, medical, polytechnic, &c. Then comes the right of indiscriminate military enlistment, expressed, however, only in principle. The opinion of the Porte is demanded as to how she could best combine the application of this principle with the existing military institutions of Turkey. The last point is the removal of the prohibition on non-MIussiihan subjects for filling civil and military offices. Thus you see nothing has been omitted which can contribute to the objects in view; on the contrary, many subjects have been touchedon which have only indirectly reference to it. The propositions about the fourth point have thus grown into the project of a complete social, judicial, political, and military reform, nor could it be expected to be otherwise, for the principle of complete equality, civil and political, of all subjects, alters entirely the bases of all institutions in Turkey. Several conferences have been held at the Porte to discuss the merits of these propositions of. the allies, and on the 26th inst., that is, the day before yesterday, a great Council was held, at which the answer to these propositions was considered. I can bear as yet nothing of the nature of this answer, but it is highly probable that the general principles themselves will, under existing circumstances, notbe obiected to. But whether such sweeping reforms can be carried out at one stroke is another question altogether. They imply a revolution as complete for Turkeyss that of '93 in France. If I am well informed, even the Ambassadors do not expect complete success, but they seem to have started from the traditional diplomatic maxim to demand a great deal in order to get a. little. Over in Scutari affairs go on well enough to disarm criticism. The stables at Raider Pasha have been completed and all the horses are now in the newly-erected buildings. As I wrote toyou some time ago, owing to the shortness of notice which was given to General Storks for the constrction of these buildings, part of them was not completed tvhen the cavalry arrived en masse. The consequence was that the horses which had no room in the aIready finished stables were in the meantime quartererd in the khans of the town of Scutari Since I lat wrote considerable changes have taken place in the cleanliness of the buildings as well asof the approaches. The ground under the horses has been partially paved, and roads made across the yad,wbhl were a great desideratmnas the soft clay is very soon converted into a mass of mud. The drainage of the whoIe neighbourhood of Raider Patha has likewise begun, and wi go on with rapidity, now that a great number of earthen pipes have arrived, which will be employed for the purpose. That all theso things had not been prepared before the cavalry came down must not be laid on the shoulders of the military authorities in S&utari, but on those who did not make up their minds until the end of October whether to send down the cavalry or not, and, entirely ignorant of the means which coald be obtained for the purpose, imported about 3,000 horses and 3,500 men to be housed by thebeginning of December, several miles of road tobe made, and all area of a couple of niles, pat of wiubch forms the basin for all the little streams of the surrolnding mountains, to be thoroughly drained. These are jobs which may be done in England with facility, but which cannot be ccomplished herewith al the power money gives. Worknen, even at high rates, are extremely scare, and not to be dependecl on for aceuracy. Hiring mostly Greeks, they are sure to have every week aeveal particular W t s hce cOmmetima a Imolyaay absolutely necessary. As for the employment of soldiers, everybody knows what this means in an English army-it is giving additional sixpences for doing nothing. To any one who knows the pystem of labour in these parts the surprising thing is, not that onetenth of these 3,000 horses was not in the new stables when they came down in the beginning of December, or that the stalls were not paved, or aacadamized roads constructed, but that the works were already advanced enough to accommodate so manyhorses and nen. It required ailGeneralStorks decision and energyto do it, and I think he deserves the highest credit for what he has done, and more Eo for what he is doing, for no one who sees the daily improvements made can come to any other conviction than that General Storks is perfectly aware of what is wanted, and tries according to his bestability to remedy the shortcomings,which could not be accomplished at so short a notice. The infantry regiment belonging to the Polish Legion has, as I wrote before, volunteered to construct its own barracks, which are placed on an open piece of ground between the villages of Scutari and Haider Pasha. Their officers have given the plan, and likewise superintend-the execution of it. I made a mistake about the German Legion in my last. The 2d Regiment of iUght Infantry, on board the transport steamer Transit, only came in here on Saturday last. They had veryheavy weather in the B3ay of Biscay, and had to put into Vigo Bay to repair some derangement in the engine. As there is not room for all the four regiments of the German Legion in the Kululee Barracks, a camp has been pitched for them on the side of the hill beforehand, so that they may get under shelter as soon as they disembark. Three companies of the German Legion have been sent to Sinope, taking two months' provisions with them. You are aware that it was intended to carry the telegraphic line over to Scutari This is now all but accomplished, and in a couple of days this central depOt of the British army in the East will be in direct telegraphic communication with England. The wire is carried along the roofs of the houses, which makes it not only safer, but dispenses likewise with the poles. The carrying of the telegraphic wire over the houses in thc Turkish quarters rather frightened their inhabitants by its strangeness and novelty, and an amusing story is current in this respect. The wire crosses at the Turkish village of ihanlidgd, on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, and the proprietor of the first house over which the line is carried made a representation that not one of the ladies would stay in the house, as they had got it into their heads that the mysterious black wire had the power of divulging all the secrets of the places over which it was passing. I don't know whether these apprehensions of the Ladies were allayed, but the telegplhic 'wire passes over their house. The measures taken by General Storks to abate drunkenness answer unco,umonly welL The prohibition of the sale of spirits is carried out with the utmost severity, and numberless bottles have been confiscated. Of colurse,there arecontinual attempts to elude this vigilance, but the polce regulations are so well organized that these contrivances are all shortlived. The other day the police came on the trace of a rather ingenious and novel method of selling spirits. A vendor set up with two large jars of milk, which found an immense number of consumers among the soldiers. The polce, rather astonished at this sudden fancy for such a primitive beverage, found that the milk was mixed with a considerable quantity of rai, which explained the whole thing quite satisfactorily for the authorities, if not for the vendor. The consequence of these measures is that there is scarcely a case of drunkenness, and that Scutari is thus transformed into the first place, perhaps, where British troops are models of sobriety. This satisfactory state of things is likewise favourably reacting on the demand for money-orders, and they increase every day rapidly. In Scutari orders for as much as 1261. have been issued in one day, and on this side for as much as le91. The sunis would have been larger, but the soldiers, taking the regulations literally, thought that they could not send more at once than 51., whereas they can send as many five pounds as they choose. If one sees how orderly things go on in Scutari, where there is one head and a salutary niilitary law, one cannot but wish for a similar state of things on this side of the water, where the executive power has as many, if not more anrs, than the Indian god Siva boasts of, but unfortunately without any head at all. If an evil arises, every one of these arms, eager to have, as the saying goes, a finger in the pie, grasps the other, inatead of the evil, and they thus impede each other most effectually. Take an example. Some sharpers of the lowest kind, whose very breath is contagious, have set up a gambling-table at the Jardin des Fleurs, called so because people assemble there in a hot wooden building, surrounded by mud, to dance, eat, anud drink. These original gambling tables are kept by the secum of Pera and Galata, and yet they attract officers of the allied armies, who are not ashamed to defile themselves by commg in contact with such people. Lately a new gambling table has been opened for the pecial benefit of English officers by one Morris, of London notoriety. This latter is in a private room, and surrounded with every kind of precaution used in such establislihments in England. If there were martial law here, as there is in Scutari, the evil could be easily checlked, but, under existing circumstances, there is no possibility of summary proceedings; but I don't see why, in the latter case, the English consular authorities could not interfere, Mfr.; -Ioris being an English subject, and gamblin-houses being forbidden in England. If the consulardepartment does not think itself competent, I have no doubt in such a case the interference of the English military authorities would be quite excusable, although Perm is not actually under military law. Anything to abate such a crying eviL. Only the other day a young English officer, who had beenfor two months sick in Scutari, came over, and lost the two months' pay which he had economized during his sicknes3 in one evening. As these gambling establishments ae chiefly intended for Englishofficers, who have most money to lose, the English authorities ought to take the lead in putting a stop to them. I am told that in a few days the telegaph to England will be thrown open for the use of the public. If the charges are reasonable it will certainly be a great boon. A few days ago there was a row between some English and French merchant sailors. A boat belonging to the latter wasmoored alongside the quay, in front of the British Naval-offices; another boat, manned by English sailors, came in, and wanted the crew of the French boat to make room for it to approach, when an altercation ensued which ended in blows. An inquiry is being held about the matter. This morning the first meeting of the hounds belonging to the English cavalry took place behind Haider Psha;r hear just now it has been very successful; it iwas attended by a crowd of people not only from S&itari but likewise from Pera, not; a few among them Turks, who are said to have witnesed this nglish national sport with great interest. A fom was soon found, and after a fair rannof about half-an-hour Idlled, to the greathorror of the Turks. The Crimean mail camne in this morning at 11a.m.
FOIEGN YTIEMIaGEZC. FRANE (nFROM OUR OWN OORBE ON0DET.I PARIS, WEDNSDAY, Fm. 6, 6 P.Mr. I am informed that pamsports have been sent ,to Vienna by order of the French Government for count Orloff and Baron Brunow, the Russian plenipotentiaries at the Paris Conferences; the former comes from St. Petersburg, the latter from Frankfort. Baron Brunow is expected to leave Frankfort to-morrow for Paris. M.deBourqueney,oneof the plenipotentiaries for France, leaves Vienna tomorrow also for Paris. M. de Buol, the Austrian plenipotentiary, will not reside during his stay in Paris at the hotel of the Austrian Embassy; a house has been taken expressly for him in the Rue de Rivoli. A letter from St. Petersburg, under date of the 27th alt., describes the effect produced there by the news of the acceptance by Russia of the Austrian propositions. The following are extracts - " To the astnishment-I should rather say tho stupefaction-produced by the decision of the 16th of January have succeeded reflection and comments. People begin to discuss causes and results; and the consequence is that ideas of peace are becoming decidedly popular. The Grand Duke Constantine himself, the most warlike of the Imperial family, has grown quite conciliatory in his language. Conversing lately with the military commissioner of a foreign Court at St. Petersburg, the Prince is said to have expressed himself thus:-' After all, my brother Alexander has acted wisely in adhering to the proposition of Austria. Peace has, no doubt, its merit, and it puts a stop to the calami. ties Europe has suffered the last two years; it is, after all, a sort of glory which may be fully equal to any other.' " ' Your Highness feels, then,' was the reply, ' that the presat war had great danger for Russia, and that the Muscovite empire, isolated from- the rest of Europe, was approaching a catastrophe.' "'Such is not say opinion,' rejoined the Grand Duke. 'Russia would have defended herself to the last with heroism; and, in spite of the formidable preparations of the belligerent Powers, I am convinced that the next campaign in the Baltic would have conferred nothing on our adversaries. But the internal condition of the country has changed my sentiments, and I nowthink that the Emperor has adopted a prudent course.' "Now, if the opinions of the ostensible leader of the war party are modified to such an extent, you may judge of the change that has been produced among the courtiers. "At St. Petersburg Prince Alexander lienschikoff is the only person of importance who indulges in recriminations. He asks why the aristocracy do not protest against an act which he loudly condemns. The truth is, the aristocracy have borne all the weight of the war. They have suffered cruelly, and are likely to suffer long after the war shall have terminated. 'While fighting was the only order of the day-fighting for the orthodox faith of St. Vlidimir; while the higher and lower classes of the clergy preached upon the defence of the nation, and promised the delights of etermal bliss to the martyrs of the faith; and, above all, while thc Sovereign appearedc* disposed to confirm on the field of battle the ambition of his predecessors, the nobility, from patriotism and pride, upheld the standard of the empire. All was fair .and glorious in the beginning; the young nobles only saw in the war the means of adding military rank to their family titles. But it was soon felt tha' the war was cehausting Russia ; that it inflicted evil on her greatest resource, her agriculture; and that the blockade annihilated her foreign trade, which is indispensable to her immense expenditure, and her credit, which is necessary to her mercantile operations. "In spite of all this Prince Menschikoff continues hostile to everytlig in the shape of an arrangement. When he found that the Grand Dulke Constantine himself differed from him, he declared to all who approached him that there was no longer a drop of Muscovite blood in the empire. During an audience with the Emperor he complained bitterly that the high and noble policy of the Czar Nicholas, alone worthy of a true Muscovite, was abandoned. His visit had for its object, it is said, to be named the representative of Russia at the Congress of Paris. The Emperor positively refused to intrust so important a mission to the man who was the immediate cause of the war, and he dismissed Prince Mfenshikoff, telmig him that it would have been much better and much more useful had he displayedat the battle of the Alma, where an opportunity was given for the display of real heroism, a conduct more in accordance with the haughtiness of h,is present languge. This mnorning the Admiral made another attempt with the Grand Duke, with whom he has long been a favourite; but the Prince refused to receive him, and ordered him, through an aide-de-camp, to prceeed to Cronstadt, to perform the duties which the Emperor had intrusted to him. 'What I mention relative to the sentiments of the nobility only applies to the capital, or at most tothis province. I lately stated that the news from the governments of the initerior, as received by telegraph, was opposed to ideas of peace. Such is the case, and it is confinmed by every post that comes from the provinces. It is in old Russia particularly that the greatest dissatisfaction is felt with the decision of the Czar. The people, though in a state of destitution, declare that Russia is lost, and that she is abandoned by the great Vladimir Is " The Czar, as I have already informed you, adopted of himself, and without any one expecting it, the resolution to accept the Austrian propositions. This is true beyond a doubt, though it is also true that he listened to the counsels of some prudent persons. The two Gortschakoffs have done much. The influence of the one who represents Russia at Vienna was great, and it is fortunate that the Czar has much confidence in his diplomatic experience and ability. Prince Michael Woronzoff, the ex.Commander-in-Chief of the army of the Crimea, did not wait for the last moment to explain to his master the real state of affairs. He also has much weight with the Emperor, and his arrival at St. Petersburg might be considered as a fortunate eventby those who desire peace. He was at once summoned to the Winter Palace, and had a long and private audience with the Emperor He visited the same day the Grand Dukes Michael and Nicholas and the War M1inister. Before qtuitting Odessa for Moscow, and then St. Petersburg, he delivered over to General Laders the powers he had been invested with. The active forces of Russia in the peninsula are now estimated at about 60,00 men, including the divisions of infantry, cavalry, artilery, grenadiers, druschines of the militias of Kaluga and Xursk. The artillery possesses 280 field pieces, The Corps of Observation of Eupatoria, Theodosia, and Kertch axe not comprised in that amount. it vas on the 18th that General Luders assumed the command of the army of the south. On the foUowing day General Souhazo. nett-the same whose name so often gave occasion to the Emperor Nicholas for laughter, who used to pun on it thus, '&Sois honn4te, Ti tit peu'e-was recognized as General-inChief of the troops massed at Odessa. The military governor of this place, General Xrusenstern, has left for St. Petersburg. " The fears felt about PL do Orloff are unfoundede He is an intelligent man, who, I aun sure, will be very conciliating in the discussion which is about to open, P. Orloff is, no doubt, very punctilious and susceptible when the honour of his country is concerned; but he is among those reasonable nobles whose exaggerated susceptibility is not excited by the decision of their master. Of M. Brunow itisnotnecessarytosaymuch. Heiswellknown,and his reputation among Emropean diplomatists iz exceUent. " The papers here have been much more moderate. The Abcile du Nord, generally so aggressive, and which only a few days back thundered against Austria and her propositions, yesterday published an article quite couteur de rose. It now dwells on the sweets of peace and the benefits of agriculture. It begins thus --' A rainbow of peace appears inthe horizon,' &c.; and the Russian writer affirms that his nation and France have ever been siters. "In the chancelles the activity is still great. Couriers are constantly despatehed from our capital to the capitals of Europe, or to the principal towns of the provinces. At Odessa and Finland we are told that the prospect of peae has produced the greatest enthusiasm. " On the 20th the Emperor reviewed the reserves and the whole of the artilery. He was received with the wamest acclanations, and the popularity he enjoys is unquestionably owig to his decision of the 16th." The following letter has been received from Constantinople, under datethe 28th of January - " The conferences which took place at the Grand Vizier's are now suspended. The Ministry has accepted all tho reforms proposed by the Ambassadors of England, France, and Austria. The minutes of the proceedings, consisting of 20 or 25 articles, were communicated ce Saturday to the Grand CounciL The Sheik-nl-Islam assid at the sitting, which was of a rather stormy nature, and lasted until 2 o'clock in the morning. The questions, discussed with muchanimationin the conferences, niet with astill more obstinate opposition inthe Grana Council; whichwasverynatural, since the resoluti6nsadoptedctipulated absolute freedom of conscienceforChristians and Mussulmansthe admission of the Christians into the army, the organization of courts of justice, the reorganiztion of the Greek and Armenian communities, "c.

It is not at Constantinople the difriculty lies, but in the provinces, where the old fanaticism is stilt as mnuch alive as ever. The Government will also mueet with much resistance from the pubBe functionaries, who, from inertness or unwillingness, will paralyze the liberal in. tentions of the Sultan. The decision of the Gra:nd Council is not yet known, but, as the measures have been adopted by the Ministers, they must necessarily be ratified by that Council, notwithstanding the opposition they experienced at the first sittig. The acceptance by Russia of the Austrian ultimatua continues to be tSo exclusive subject of conversation. Notwithstanding the numerous despatches confirming the fact received hero from Viennaand Paris, manypersons stil disbelieve it. TheGreeks, for stockjobbing purposes, had reported that the Emperor Alexander was murdered after the accepthce of the tsdi,actum, but it was aoon ascertained that the report was unfonuded. The Ottoman Ministry and the high functionaries of the empire manifested the greatest joy on hearing of the successful issue of Count Esterhazy's mission. In the meantime recruits arrive daily at Constantinople, and are embarked for Asia. it is said that Ismail Pasha, General-in-Chief of the army on the Danube, is to proceed shortly to Erzeroum. The English General who assisted at the council of war on Asiatic affairs has directed the Ottoman merAbers of the commission not to suspend their preparations. The Muchir Vedjihi Pasha is shortly to leave for Erzeroum, in order to reorganize the Commissariat Department. That appointment is significant, inasmuch as it proves a serious intention on the part of the Government to place the army in Asia on a respectable footing. ML Alphonse de Rothwchild, who has beeu here for some time, was received on Saturday by the Sultan. His object is to establish a bank at Constantinople. The exchange has fallen considerably since the news of peace. The French intendance is actively engagedinproviding supplies for the army. IL Dabut, the sub-intendant, left last week for Alexandria, and one of his coUeagues repaired on Friday to Smyrna. Peace, I am afraid, will cause many failures. The price of provisions has already declined considerably, and many speculators will be obliged in consequence to suspend their payments at Kamiesch, Balaklava, and Constantinople. The Crimean mail of the 26th reached tnday. The acceptance of the ittinmatu2n was known on the evening of the 2'23, and produced the greatest sensation in the allied army. The weather was much milder, and the sanitary condition of the troops was excellent." The groat probability that peace will be the result of the approaching conferences seemfs to be an idea fixed in the public mind. lThe Legislative Corps, which was to meet on the 26th inst., will not do so before the 4th of MIarch, when it is expected that theo.reeable tidings of the signning of a definitive treaty of peace will be announced to that body. From the eagerness with which such a conclusion is looked to we may form a notion of the enthusiasm with which it will be hailed. There are still a few who doubt or fear, as their partialities incline them. It is true thatRussia will have by tlis acquired the certainty that the great majority of the people of this country desire peace; but it is to be hoped that she will not therefore become more intractable or more ready to create obstacles. It would be a dangerous game to play, if it be her design to try it; for if the war be continued the military character of this people might be thoroughly roused, and the results. may be such as no one would desire. Be this as it may, it is not the less a fact that the population of Paris is so sure of peace that it appears to almost forget that wra r has ever been declared, that battles have been fought, that Sebastopol is a mass of ruin, and that there is still an armv encamped in the Crimea. It thinks little of the past, and is entirely taken up with the future. It has one prevailing thought, and that is what great enterprise will be undertaken by the Governments as soon as the peace treaty is signed. I believe the Emperor to be as anxious for peace asanyone, not from an intention of renouncing the present and of forming new alliances, as he cannot but be aware that such an act would be to him disastrous; but, having won sufficient military glory for France, and secured the respect of the continental Sovereigns, he would satisfy an ambition of another and a more harmless kind-the development of the resources of the country he rules oves' and which the form of his government will enable him to effect more easily than if he were liable to the checks which are found in a more liberal system. It is probable that in a country where the initiative of the Government exercises so much influence, particularlywitha r9-gimc such as nowprevails, the Govermuent will on this occasion also take the lead inannouncing what benefitthenation willreap from the peace. As it is, various projects connectedwith internal improvenient are even now contemplated. They are reported to be on a vast scale, and are quite characteristic of the Emperor, whose partiality for designs of a vast extent is well known, and are quite consistent with the sympathies which he has never ceased to express, and doubtless to feel, for the improvement of the labouring classes of the population. One of the projects most frequently spoken of relates to the great activity which isnto be imparted to the association of the Credit Foncier, which, since July, 1854, has become a regular Governmental institution. Through this establishment it is intended to promote in every part of the empire, and on a large scale, the improvement of agriculture, which is known to be in a very backward condition. It would secure more ample returns from the harvest, lower the price of provisions, and better the condition of the agricultural classes, which form threefourths of the entire population. These views the Emperor entertained when he delivered the celebrated speech at the Bordeaux banquet previouls to the Imnperial Government, when he concluded with the words " L'Empire 'east lapaizP I Hispartiality towards that class was in his public addresses always put forth; and in his speech at St. Quentin, while yet President of the Republic, he boasted that it walS among them that he counted his best and most devoted friends. The combination now alluded to, and which seems to be the most popular, consists in enabling the Cr4dit Foncier to profit by the credit of the State, which is considered the surest,. and which can consequently borrow at a lower rate. It is said that the State is to advance to the Cr6dit Foncier a large aurm at a certain rate of interest, with a sinldng fund, and which it is considered might be realized by meaus of annuities paid by the landed proprietors. The sum proposed to be advanced will, it is said by some, be not less than a milliard, or 40,000,000f. sterling-perhaps, from some analogy with the mnilliard paid, under the}Restoration, to the emSf,or with that which the National Convention premised to the defenders of the country against invason. Those persons who approve the plan do not apprgve it merely on the ground that it has been imvariably the praetice in France for the State to interfere in the affairs of individuals ; but they instance 1 nglid, where assistance 'was given after 1846 to the a,ricultural Classes, and, again, the UJnited States, where the governments of paticular States have been in the habit of aiding railroad undertalings in a form and mamner which resemble that now proposed to be done through the instrumentalityof the Cr4dit Foncier.

AfON3ZYMABKETanrd OTYI'NTZELIGENCE. Thursday ETen!ng. This has been setling day in the English funds, and they have consequently experienced several fluctuations. Consols for money opened with great firmness at the inproved quotation of last evening, -namely, 91k to j, whence they further navanced to 91. A rather heavy delivery of stock which took place in connexion with the settlement, coupled with one or two sales, then caused a reaction to 90I to J; but immediately after the official close ibuoyancy vas again manifested, and tranactions werefreely entered into at 9lifor money and 91j to J- for the 11th of Mzrch. Duiing the arrangement of the account loans were in demand at 6 per cent. At the Bank of England applications continue numerous, and the discount-market is without any distinct sign of increased ease. Ln the Stock-Exchange this morning another failure was announced, but its amount was not large. Bauk Stock left off at 213 to 214; Reduced, 9lt to i; New Threeper Cents., 920 Log Antuies SbAnnitis,1885, 16k; Inui3Stock, 223 to 225;kxcheqLrer.bonas, 97j to 98; and India Bonds and Exchequer-bills, 7's. to 2s. discount. Foreign securities generally were firmx, but the highest prices wrere not maintained to the close. per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 93k, 92g, ,j, and. W In the Four per Censt. Guaranteed Stock transactions took place at 100. for money and 100k, i, and l for the account. The other business comprised(ranada New Active, 20; Mexican, for the acount, 20i and i; Sparnsh Three per Cents., for the account, 43, k, and 43; the New Deferred, for account, 24 and 24k; Dutch Four per Cent. Certiffcates, 95k; and Feruvian Dollar Bonds, GO. The closingprices of the French Three perCents. on the Pars :ourie this evening were 72f. 30c. for money and 72f. 8We. for the end of the monthb showing a decEne of an eighth. At Vienna the money-market has been rather less finn, and from Amsterdam the quotations exhibit little activity. A numerous meeting of the holders of WVestminster Improvement Bonds took place to-day at the London Tavern, lIr. G. Ogle in the chair. The subiect was stated to be the cosideration of means fororganizing a project which, while it would assist to cary out the plans of the late commission, would improve the value of the bonds and prevent the absolute loss at present threatened. This involved the raising of additionalcapital, and the merits of the proposed Westninster Consolidated Investment Society were contrasted with those of the W%estmiinster Land Company. As, however, to put either schleme in motion it would be requisite to provide funds-80,0001. in the former ease and 40,0001. in the latter-there was little disposition to support them, especially since it is alleged that many of the mortg3ges are illegal, and that the total liabilities with regard to these and other supposed claimns may be considerably reduced. It appeared, also, to be considered that the suit w.hich hasbeen instituted in Chancery wil place the boudhpolders eventually ina position to recover their rights and render parties responsible who are capable in a pecuniary sense of being brought to an account. The whole, conduct of the comiission, and those associated with it, including the Commissioners of WVoods and Forests, who entirely neglected to audit the required financial statements, wasseverelyanimadvertedupon, and an appeal to the Legislature was accordingly recommended. No other investigation, it was urged, would unravel the mysterious proceedings connected with this undertaking, and the ineffective results of the late committee of inquiry were adduced as showing the necessity of Government iterference. After a lengthened discussion of nearly three hours, it was resolved that a committee be appointed to wait upon the Home Secretary and state their case to him, with the view of requesting his asisistance in procuring a Parliamentary inquiry. At a meeting of the London and County Bank, held to-day, MIr. J. Sadleir, 3L.P., presiding, a dividend -was declared of 5 per cent. for the halfyear, with a bonus of 5 per cent.,equal to a dividend of 15 per cent, per annum, and the report and accounts were adopted. It was stated thtat business is naking satisfactory progress, and that the prospects of the new branches are encouraging. It was agreed that the reserve fund shall stand at 100,0001, thle directors being of opinion that 20 per cent, upon the paid-up capital of the bank is sufflcient. The clerks' provident and guarantee funds are also steadily augmenting, the balances at their credit amounting together to 16,0634. Annexed is an abstract of the report and accounts:- ". The directors have to present the report for the halfyear ending the 3Lst of December, 1855. The net profits of the bank for the past half-year, after making due provision forbad anddoubtful debts, amount to 34,005i Ss. 10d., which, with 13,W31. Is. 2d. brought forward from the halfyear ending the 30th of June, and 5,2751. 10s. 4d., the balance of the reserve fund, in excess of 100,000!., will leave a disposable sum of 52,9741. Os. 4d. The directors recommend that a dividend, of 5 per cent. for the half-year, and a bonus of 5 per cent. (equal to a dividend of 1~5 per cent. on the year), both free from income-tax, upon the atd-up capital of the bank, be now declared. This, if approvectby the proprietors, will leave the sam of 4,8421. 1&. 2., of which tho directors recommend that 4,23!. lSs. 9L. shoutd be presented to the oflicers of the bank, being 10 per cent. upon their salaries ; that the sum of 5001. be placed to the credit of the ' Sadleir Provident Fnd;' andX the balance of 1071 19s Sd be carriel forward to the next account. After giving the subject the most mature consideration, the directors are of opinion that 2D per cent. upon the paid-up capital of the bank is sufficient for the reserve fund On the adoption of this priciple the amount vill continue ut 100,000!. The directos, in noticing the satisfactory manner in which the duties of the officers of the bank have been performed, feel assured it will meet the cordial assent of the proprietors to present them vith 10 per cent. on the amount of the salaries received by them for the year endig the 31st day of December, 1855. Towards the close of 1855 branches were opened iathe borer h of Southwark and inOxford-street, of the prospects which the directors have every reason to speak conildently. *- Bsxc-s,sxzr OF TEE L.ob-no A5D Couar BAsic Dem ING Cos5Pc, DEC. 31, 1855.

D. Powles in the chair, when the report of the committee (an abstract of which has appeared in 917e Times) was adopted, and a series of resolutions were passed, urging upon the Government of the country the necessity of a speedy adjustientof thedebt. Theservicesof lfr.Paiishi, the British Consul, and of Mfr. Giro, the special commissoner appointed to represent the English creditors, were fully acknowledged, and an opinon was expressed that a settlement on terms similar to those punctually discharged by Chili should alone be accepted. The suspension was announced this morning of l!Iessrs. Chambers and :llwood, in the wine trade, with liabilities for abolit 20,000l. The firm were very pectable, and their losses are understood to have been caused by serious defalcations on the part of persons in. their employ, coupled with some heavy bad debts. Their assets, it is said, will yield at least 10s. to 12s. in the pound, and' it is hoped that arrangements will be made for th6 business to be carried on without intweruption. A report has been circulated snce the failure of Mfessrs. Scott Russell- nid Co. that tlle firn of Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co. are among their creditors for a large amount. It is wholly destitute of foundation, and few things could be more discreditable than the habit which has lately-prevailed onthe part of many persons of rendering themselves, by giving ciurrency;to such statements, the reckless instruments of those. who invent them, obviously for purposes'of the meanest kind. Purther Oorrespondence has-been received regarding the assurance case recentl tried between Mr. Engclhardt and sone of theaerwritersat Lloyd's. Mr. 1ngelhardt, ia -a long letter, meets every at-' tempt to controvert his original stateents, while. several mcimbers of -jiyd's endeavour at similar length, stin to dispute-the conclusion' tiat his case, viewed under mercantieW rather than legal and tech- vical impressions, is an exceedingly strong one. The matter has excited great interest among the commercial community, and advantage would resut from its being fully and inpartiaBly discussed upon its real merits, but the requisite space cannot be afforded in Die Tinws. The subjoined report on the London silk-market is from the circular of Messrs. Dmrant and Co.:- " We have to report a large business mn ilk at very ful prces, the last transactions in China silk, andtbese not of trifing extent, having been at rates 15 per cent. above thoe obAined for several arcels sold in the depressed 3moments of November. Ia China sik the business of the year opened at least a fortnight earher than usua, the inproved prices obtained in the last days of December inducing isnporters to be ready sellers as the several vessels dibeharged their cargoes. U the morning of the 17th ult. it was supposed that 4,000to 5,000 baes China silk had been soll witWeoutany quotable change of price ; the news then announced induced importers to pause; for a few days 6d. per lb. was all the improvenent they could reallze, but subsequently the desire to purcae became more decided, and in the lst. few daysaful 16to ls. 6L has been obtained, export atpresent talang only smalU quantity.

According to the cirular of ML ArIes Dufour, the prospects of peace have caused an advanc-e during the past month in the Lyons silk-market of between 5 and 7 per cent. Stocks both of raw and. thrown silk are much reduced, but the supplies from. China are good, and are daily getting intD increasec use. The following on the Liverpool wool-market is from Mes8rs. Abram Gartaide and Co. * The buoyant feeling in the wool-market etill exists, anet prices have farther improved. The accounts from the manufacturing districts are cheerful, and this, combinedi with the decreasing state of our previously light stocks, gives strength to the opinion that the present value is likely toe sustained. Short idndsof low qu-ality, such as East. India, Peruvian, Cordova, Mediterranean, &c>, are not. quotably higher than at our last public sales, but the tendency is upwards& The most marked rise has been-in English, and Irish combing kinds, 'wbich are saleable at Wd per lb. advance upon the rates current early last month. P-'art cf' this change is attributable to the improved state ce trade at Bradford, but great stimulus has been given to these long-stapled sorts by the material reduction in the import duty hltherto paid by 'French consumers, by Whom such. wools are largelyused. Other descriptions, saitable forexport as well as home consumption, are much wanted, and River Plafe merino and mestizo, from 10d. nupwards, may be quoted ld. to 2d. per lb. dearer." Among recent conmercial publications has been a- pamphlet on the a;ffairs of the Great WVestemn Rail'way, entitled "WffiYhut next? end ncxt?"* by the. writer of the letters in Thic Times whicb, underthe signature of " Investigator," helped considerably to attract public attention last autumn to ths peculiar position of that company. Bradslax's S7crchdcdenrr' Guide, RailayMansiual, andlDircorsy,t has likewise been published for 1856, and is againcharacterized by the amount of information condensed into it and the convenient sty1l of its arrangement.

The half-yearly meeting of the class A shareholders in this company was held yesterday at the office, Parliamentstreet; Mr. Edvwards in the chair. Mr;-Byrme, the secretary, read the report, which stated that a comnmittee of shareholders was appointed at the meeting held on the 13th of December last to co erate 'with the directors, for the purpose of devising a plan for extricating the company from its embarrassing position. Since that period the directors have been in constant communication with the gentlemen forming the committee, and for Whose valuable assistance the directors are much indebted. The result of their cO-oDeration is that a company is in course of formation uiith the view of purchasing the rights and interests of the present shareholders upon terms which wl be submitted for their a)pproval at a special meeting to be held at an early date, in lieu of considering the same at the meeting which was proposed to be held after the ordinary business of the present meeting. With reference to the terms, the shareholders must not be unprepared to receive payment for their shares in a new stock-, and to assist in raisig the additional capital.

CEWTAL CRIzINAL. COUBT, Feb. 7. OLD COURT. - (Before Mr. JustteC WIGHMAS and Mr. Justicc WnLES) TIE MURDER IN BEDFORD-ROW. At the sitting of the 9ourt Charles Broadfoot Westron, 25, described as a clerk,"was placed at the bar to take his trial for the wilful murder of George Waugh. It has been already stated that the prisonor is a diminutive, deformed person. He did not appear to evince any interest during the examination of the witnesses for the prosecution, but he appeared to pay great attention to the whole of the evidenco that was adduced in his behalf to establish the defence of insanity. During the whole of the tria he stood leaning againstthe head of the steps leading from the dock, and not close to the bar, which is the usual place for prisoners while on their trial. 3fr. Clarkson, Mfr. Clerk, and Mr. Giffard conducted the prosecution. Tne prisoner was defended by Mr. Ballantine, Mr. Metcalfe, and Mr. F. H. Lewis. The leaned counsel for the prosecution, in opening the case to the jury, said that tho unhappy man at the bar was charged with an offence which it was idle to suppose tho jury had not heard and read of before, and which was one of the highest crimes known to the law. The circumstances were very clear, and left no doubt whatever that the prisoner's was the hand that had caused the death of the unfortunate deceased gentleman. On the present occasion he had the honour of representing the executors of the deceased, and they-were not cognizant of any facts that could at all alter the complexion of the crimes; but he believed that an attemnpt would be made to show that the prisoner was not responsible for his actions by reason of insanity, and that witnesses would be called to make out that defence. The duty was cast upon the counsel for the prisoner to make out that case, and if the evidence upon the point should be satisfactory to the jury, the gentlemen for whom he appeared, and who, of course, had no other object than the vindication of the justice of the country, would be peifectly satisfied with the result. The evidence for the prosecution was then gone into. ;Mr. T. K. Pitfield said,-I am clerk to a solicitor. On the mornirg of the 16th of January I saw the prisoner standing near Bedford-row. He appeared to be going into Bedford-row, but suddenly stopped, and stood close to the railings at the cbrner of the street. Abont half-past. 10 o'clock I saw Mr. Waugh on the opposite side of the way, and at this moment I observed the prisoner take something from his sleeve, and then walk up the s,reet towards Mr. Waugh, and when he was about four yards from him he raised his arm, and presented something shining at him, at the same time exclaiming, " You villain, you have ruined me; why did you rob me of my property?' I immediately afterwards heard the report as of a pistol, and the deceased exclaimed, " Hold himcollar him; he has murdered me," and fell to the ground. I went towards the prisoner, and he drew a second pistol from his pocket, and cocked it with his left hand. I then said to the prisoner, "Why did you shoot the poor man? You ought not to have done that."P Re replied, "He has ruined me; he has robbed me of my property." I said, "Now you have ruined your- sell." The prisoner answered, " I don't care- I hive done it," and dropped the second pistoL. Mr. Waughs at this time w.-as lying on the ground, out ho was not dead He renained on his legs a few seconds after he was shot. Some persons then came up, and the prisoner Wa1S seized and taken to the .station-house. Mr. BARLLNTINE declined to cross-examine the witness, and said he was not at all in a position to dispute the facts. The COURT intimated that it was necessary to call more witnesses to prove the same facts. Thomas Hntchins, the rtreetkeeper, proved that he heard the report of firearms in Bedford-row, and on going to the spot he saw the deceased on the pavement. The prisoner was exclaiming, " He has ruined me, and I will be the ruin of him." Witness assisted to convey him to the policestation, and as they were going along the prisoner said he wanted his money to go abroad with. He then took a knife from his pocket, and witness took it from him. Sergeant Hayes, of the metropotan police, proved that the prisoner was given into his charge for the murder of frAVaaugh. When the charge had been entered the prisoner said the deceased had brought it all upon himself; he had robbed him of his property-some acres of land; he added, "He was a relative of mine; he married into our family r and he then turned round in the dock and said, " Now I am satisfied." Tvo pistols were handed to witness, and he found one of them to be loaded. The other had been recently discharged, and the nipple was broken. Inspector Checkley proved that, as he was taking the prisoner to Clerkenwell Police-court, he told him that if it had not been for the deceased he should have had 8001., but now heshould only have 4001., and God only knew when he should get that, as it had been thrown into Chancery. He afterwards searched the prisoner's lodging at Kiensington, and found a bullet mould,.powder, bullets, and caps. By Mr. B A.Na-mr-W itness had ascertained that the prisoner purchased the pistols 18 months ago. Mr. Erasmus Wren, a surgeon, provetthat he examined the body of the deceased, and found a gunshot wound. His death was occasionedby a bullet that had traversed the body and passed through the heart, and death must have been almost instantaneous. MIr. John Pyrke, clerk to the deceased, proved that certain letters that were produced were in the handwriting of the prisoner. He also said that the deceased had acted as solicitor for the prisoner for a considerable time, and he had frequently seen the prisoner at the office of the deceased in Great James-street, Bedford-row. MIr. James Barrow, another clerk to the deceased, proved that in October last, in consequence of a letter that was sent by the prisoner to the deceased, Mr. Waugh, obtained a summons against the prisoner, and complained that his life vwas in danger, as he believed, from him ; and it was also stated in the prisoner's presence tllathe was in the habit of carrying firearms about with him. The summons was heard at Clerkenwell Police-court, and the prisoner attempted to pass it off as a laughing matter, and said it was a delusion on the part of Mr. Waugh to imagine such a thing. The magistrate asked him for an explanation, and he said he had none to give, as he did not mean anything by the expressions in the letter. The magistrate ultimately required him to give an assurance that he would not go to Mr. Waugh's office any more, and to retain another solicitor, when he said he would, and the complaint was withdrawn. After this the prisoner employed a gentleman named Sandys as his attorney. The prisoner did net go to the office after the proceeding at the police-court. B,y Mlr. B.UM4srn-The magistrate did not place the prisoneronder anyrecognizances whatever. Witness was awre of the circumstaunces connected with the Chancery suit, and that 3r. Waugh had taken it up for the family, and but for this the family would probably never have received a farthing. Mr. W. Sandys, a solicitor. proved that he was concerned for the prisoner in the sale of his one-fifth share of the property, and the 14th of January was appoited for the completionof the conveyance. On the morning of that day he received a communication from Mr. Mant, one of Mr;. Waugh's clerks, and he afterwards told the prisoner that Mr. Waugh claimed to deduct certain charges from the purchase-inoney to which he (witness) objected, and, consequently, the purchase could not be completed.. The prisoner was very angry, and was exceedingly rude; he said he would have nothing more to do with the transaction, and left the office, and he saw no more of him until after this ocecurrence had happened. A police-constble was then called, who proved that on. the day prior to the melancholy occurrence the prisoner was watcLung the deceased near his residence at Notting-hilL The following letters were put in and read. The first was one addressed by the deceased gentleman to the prisoner, dated the 10th of October, 1800:- " Sir,-Your conduct was so insulting, and your remarks so impertinent and unwarrantable, at my office this morning that I find it necessa to revert to the decision some time since adopted when you pursaed a similar course of declining personal interviews, and desiring that any further commnumcations may be made either by letter or through one of my clerks, and kept within the hounds of reason and truth; in answer to which every information will be given you as to the Burrow and Mlunscombe estates. Hadyou taken a proper course of conduct amd conversation this morning, instead of using such expressions as a 'damnation swmile' and other infamous ones of a-lie nature, I should have shown you the agreement signed byyour brothers and sisters for granting a new lease of the property to 3Mr. House for two years at the same rent, and the like covenants as those in his present one, with the addition of a power for the lessors to determine the same at any one year's previous written notice to ctoso,andpayentofthe usual outgoing tenants' valuation, and for any persmanent improvements made by hint to the property with their consent in writing. I nowbhave to ask if you will sign such an agreement5 which is left with my clerk for your inspection." The answer written to this leter by the prisoner, and upon which the -proceedings at the police-court were oumnded, was as follows "Oct. 1, 1855. "Sir,-You have been told- by me over and over aain that I will not sanction (on my own behalf, i.e.-you say I can do nothing) Mr. Rouse taking a fresh lease at the rental of 2201. a-year, subject to such swindling deductions as are made through you-viz, expenses collecting half-year's rent (for me), 201. - taxes against income 1I 5s., making 12 or 13 per cent on the rent, besides other expenses; The first part of your letter contains a quotation, of some expressions you state I made use of in your presence. - It is possible I have, but more probable I have notb exactly as you wrote it, without an -additional consonant that would hive given it a more signi6cant bearing,-and have'been a more apt return of a soto roce benediction of your own to me. With respect to the other part . f y,our letter, wherein you state yoe wll not see me, I must distinetlflive you to understand that you are too dear to me to allow of my breaking our five years' acquaintance in that abrnptinanner, and therefore I sxhalitake the liberty of not only calling, but request that you will be visible on tlhe 21st of this month, which will Mbe tee months from the time last wrote yeur of which you appear quite oblivious, as also the lapse of time since you served me with a notice of your intenton to dispose of the property. I shall-have notlingfurtherto say toyou, but simply this-that'itfhny I intention-toseeyourson, as I-presume he will be placed in our shoes before long, and I should like for him to know low he wrilbe situated with me when such an event occurs, as there seems more truth than you, perhaps fancy in the remarks made by Mr. Ellis, of Tiverton, when he observed that my life hangs on a thread; and had he completed tbe sentence it would have been, 'and this gentleman's on mny right hangs on a puff of smoke.' I do not intend to have any more correspondence- with you, and having answered your letter, "1 am, Sir, yours respectfully "1 C. B. WEstRON." This was the case for the prosecution. Mr. BALLnAr'E then procceded to address the -jury for the defence. He said they would no doubt bc awaro from the course he had taken in not cross-examining any of the witnesses that he did- not mean to -dispute the facts of the case,, about which there could be no possible doubt. It was clear that a horrible act of assassmition had been committed in open dlay, and that th6 prisoner was the person who had committed that act; but he at the soari time felt quite sure that, whatever incdignation and honror the jury mnight feel at the perpetration of such a crime, they would not find. any man guilty of it, if it were made out to their satisfaction that he was not of sound mind, and consequently not responsible for his actions. This was the defence he was instructed to make on behalf of the prisoner, and he believed that, when the jury had heard the evidence he should lay before them upon the oint, they would return a verdict, the effect of which would be, not that he would escape punishment, but his life would be spared, and he would be placed for the rest of his days in a position where there would be no chance of- his doing any further mischief. Hle was aware that the defence of insanity was not a popular one, but he should not shrink from the perfornance of what he considered to be his duty on that account; and he felt assured that the jury would not hesitate in returning a verdict that the prisoner was not responsible for the act he had committed, if the evidence laid before them were such as would enable them Justly and conscientiously to come to that conclusion. The learned counsel then called the attention of the jury to various cases that had been dedided upon the subject of insanity, and observed that it appeared to be clearly established that a person mightbe labouring under a delusion upon one subject, and yet be ptrfectly sane upon almost every other; and he said he hoped - to be able to satisfy them that this dreadful act had been committed by the prisoner while under a delusion, and thathe was not at the time responsible for his acts, and-upon that ground he should ask them to say that he was not guilty. The following witnesses were then called for the defenee. Mrs. Agbourne said, in March, 1854, the prisoner lodged in her house. She showed him the bedroom, where there was a full-sized bed when he first came, end he said he could not believe the bed was long enough for him, and he should like to measure it. The bed was six feet long, and she and-her husband laughed at the idea of the bednot being long enou"h for the prisoner. The prisoner stid in the lodgilg untA the month of May following, and during that period ho behaved in a very eccentric manner. She frequently spoke to him three or four times without being able to obtain an answer, and he frequently talked ve loudly to hirself both at night and in the day time; and he seemed in a very excited state, and made use at times of very bad language. Every time he went out the prisoner used to stand in front of the house and eye it over for two or three minutes. Sometunes his conversation was rational and at others it was frivolous and childish, and when any allusion was made to himself he would stop abrautly ; and from all she had seen of him, it was her opinion that he was not right in his mind. By Mr. CsamesoN.-The prisoner complained of there being something wrong about his bed almost every day. Sometimes the prisoner would use terrible oaths, and then thumpnviolently on the table, and she was very much alarmed at his conduct. Elizabeth Williams, sister of the last witness, said that she had frequently had conversations with the prisoner, and she had heard hin walk about his- room and throw about the fumrniture. She had also heard hin say that ho wanted some spirits to make a fire to bumn the devil, who, he said, was always walking about after him and annoying him. He also said that he wished there was a trap-door to the house, that he might get outside and try to see the devil, and that lie would challenge him to fight. One evening she was ironing, and the prisoner asked her to lend him the flatiron that ho might see whether it would frighten the devil. The prisoner also said he should like to get some bullcts to shoot the devil with, and he told her upon one occasion, that if she would lend himasaucepan, he thought he should be able to hatch chickens by steam, and that it would be a very good thing. Cross-examined.-The prisoner was taken away from the lodging by his uncle, and they did not give him notice to quit. She was i good deal terrified at his conduct. Her sister's husband was a city policeman, and she told him what the prisoner said. He appeared strange and deranged in his mmd, and not to know what he was about. He informed her that he was engaged in some legal proceeding and they were aware that he received letters from his laor. Charles Agbourue, a city policeman, thehusband of thefirst witness, deposed to the same facts narrated by her. He also said that upon several occasions he sawthe prisoner engaged in maksng bullets, and also in cleaning a pistol. His conduct was generally strange. ByMn.CzAaRaSOw.-He was continually talkingnonsense. Once he told him he lkedto have a pistol about him for his nrotection. He did not recollect anything particular besldes this. 'Ar. W. Essex said that, about July, 1854, the prisoner lodged in his house. He only remained a wedk, when witness ordered him toquit in consequence of the strngeness of his conduct. le used to run up and down stairs at night, and he left the candle burning close by his bedside. He did not know what he ran up and down stairs for. It occurred about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. He did not exactly consider the prisoner a madman, but his conduct was so strange that be got rid of hnn. Mrs. Margaret Jones p roved that the prisoner lodged in her house in August, 1854, and for three or four months following. His conduct during the time was very strange. He used to make his teain a narrow mug, and he told her if anyof his fiends came afterhimshewasto shove them in the gutter. He frequently sat for two or three hours without saying aword. She once went into his room to put up a clean blnd, and he made a strange noise like a dog, and she was very much frightened. Mr. W. Carter proved that the prisoner took apartments inhis house aboat December, 1854, and remained in his house about three weeks. is conduct was very stamnge all the time, and they became quite afraid of him. He frequently looked up the chimney, and said it was too large, and there was too much draught. He also complained of the doors and the keyholes, and he frequently dragged his bed about the room. He also used to talk to himself, and appeared very excited; and it was witness's opionion that he was not fit to be trasted by himself. By Mr. BAtLNThrrn.-He once heard the prisoner say, he 4" would do something, if they-" and he could not hear any more. He also said, " If I don't have this, or that, it shall be done." He did not seem to know what he was talking about. Mrs. Elizabeth Rippon proved that the prisoner lodged in her house from December, 1854, to February, 1855. She thought his conduct very strange when he took the apartment. He stooped down and felt all over the floor, to see if there were any cracls to let in draught. She asked him for a reference, and he said, "Reference! that is all - hmmbug. I never give a reference. If I give you a month's money m advance that will be (sufficient reference for you." She once went into the prisoner's room, and saw a coat suspended over a chair, as though it had been a man sitting on it. Her opinion was that the prisoner was not sane and they, in consequence, of that impression gave him notice to quit. BY Mrr. CrAnxSOx.-They were anxious to get rid of the prisoner at the end of the first week, in coneuemeoai conduct.queno of his A number of other witnesses, in whose houses the prisoner had lodged down to the month of December, 1855, were then called, all of whom gave evidence of a similar description. It appeared that upon one occasion he had burned tome articles in his room, and said that his object was to drive out the Evil Spirit. It also appeared that upon two occasions he had tied a handkerchief round his neck so tightly as almost to strangle himself. Several of the witnesses spoke to hearing the prisoner constantly talDing to himself, and one of them stated, in answerto a question put by Mr. Clarkson, that she heard him say, "I will give it him, he shall have it. I have stood it long eone h." Sergeant Hayes, the officer who took the prisoner into custody, proved that he took from him the halves of two Bank notes-one for 101. and the other for Si. MIr. Hooper proved that, in consequence of something the prisoner told him, he went on Tuesday last to Georgealley, Thomas-street, and he there found the other halves of the notes concealed between the lintel and the bricL-work of a doorway. By Mr. CLARxEsoN.-Witness had known the prisoner 12 years, and knew his family. He once asked him to get him a situation, but he told hibn that he had sufficient property to support him, and he did not want one, and the prisoner replied that he should not wanta situation if a rogne of a lawyer bad not done him out of his property. It was six months ago whenhbe said this. He saw the prisoner in Newgate an consequence of a letter he sent to him. The prisoner appeared very wild and esxcited when be taLked about his solicitor depriving hiniof his property.- Mr. CanrsSOz asked for the letter the witiess had received, and he produced it, audit was read. It was 'dated, "Xewgate, Tuesday," and continued as follows :-" Dear Hooper,-Call upon me, if you possibly can, before 4 o'eloek to-day, as I have something to say to you, but do not speak about it if you calL" Mr. Rodham, a solicitor at Wellington, in Somersetshire, said he was well acquainted with the Prisoner's family, and he5 had known him from a child. His father destroyed himself by cutting his throat. Witness was concerned in the Chancery suit that Mr. Waugh was conducting for the benefit of the prisoner and his brothers and sisters, and he could state that MIr. Wauth had behaved most kindly in the matter, and, in fact, he had been the meanis of getting the estate for the family. The prisoner was always of a morose and sullen disposition, and there was a good deal of insanity in the family, and he had heard that the prisoner's uncle destroyed himself. By Mr. Cinsnxsas0.-An arrangement or compromise was come to with reference to the estate, by wlhch the prisoner was to receive about 4501. for his share. He did not appear to be satisfied with the amount that he vas to receive. Mr. John Walsh, a surgeon, deposed that the uncle of the -deeased was under restraint for two years before his death, andhe died in a lunatic asylum.n Mr. F. Westron, a brother of the prisoner, deposed that one of his aunts died in a lunatic asylum.. Mr. FarehamFlower, a medical gentleman resi' in Somersetshire, deposed that he attended the prisoner three years ago at the residence of his brother-in-law, at Oakhill, m that county. At this time -he was evidently sufferi g under great mental disturbance, but it was- difficult to ascertain the exct nature of his malady, becauseno rational answer could be obtained to any question that was put to him. He hadno doubt that his mmd wasaffected at that time, and the act he was now charged with commnitting confirmed this opinion: He had-heard, all the evidence that had been adduced,-and, in his oyinion, at the time the prisoner shot Mr. Waiigh he was incapable of distinguishing between right and wreig.' Cross-examined.-The prisoner was not placed under any restraint, but he expressed an opiion at the time that he ought to have been, HEe bad never seen the prisonerifrom that period until the present time, but still he considered he was justiied in the opinion he had fored as to the state of his miind at the time of this occurrene. Mr. Justice WIOnTMA asked the witness if he thought the prisoner vas in such a stateas tohis niind as to be i- caahle of knowing that it was wrong to kill aaana | IThne wntness a3id that perhaps lie could not go -that length; but he inferred from all that had taklen place. that be was at the timo incapable of distinguishing betweenright and wrong. t - l T Dr. Synnott deposed that he Ltd had'a great deil oF ex Rcrience in cases- of lunacy, and had acted -with Dr. utherland and other eminent persons in sach cases.. On Wednesday he had a short interviewv with the prisoner in Newgate, m presenee of Mi. Gibson, the surgeon of the gaoL The result ofvthe interview was that he thoughtthe prisoner was labouring under a great deficiency of mind. In all such cases it was very important to ascertain whetherthere was any taint of insanity in the fanily, and the evidence he had heard upon that point and the other facts in the case ledhimto com$to the conclusion that the prisoner- at the time he committed this act was incapabMe of distin. gaishing between right andwrong. By Mr. CLAXKSON.-Xe would not take upon himself to say that the prisoner was not avare that lng a man was wrong, but le was of opinion that he had no idea of the enormity of the act. Many lunaties would be- aware perfectly well that theact Ws a wrongone. In his conversation with the prisoner he asked him how he came to kill Mr. Waugh, and he said it was because he had olundeted him of 8001. He saidthat he hadniven him a vrtten promise -to pay on a certain day400,but the money was not paid. He sadhe was very anxious to e it, because he wanted, to go abroad, butcould not do EO, as he had no -money. He also said that Mr. Waugh was too much about him. At this stage of the conversation the prisoner became confused and ho could not understand what he said;* but he mauttered something about certain parties and certain other parties agreemngto docertain thiings. From all that occurred he wvas of opinion that the prisoner Wa5 of unsonnd 3niud. Mr. CrAisucsos then repliaL He urged that the caso had failed on the part of the defence, and he contendedthat although the prisoner might have acted in a foolish manner at some of the lodgings he had occupied, and that he-was probably a bad tempered, excitable person, nothing had ben shown to justify the jury in coming to the concusion that at the time he committed this dreadful act he was not perfectly aware what he was doing, and was therefore fully resonsible. The learned JUDGE then proceeded to sum up.; He went through the whole of the evidence very carefully, and said that there could be no doubt uplon the facts, and the only question the jury had to decide was whether the prisoner was provedto have been in such a state of mind at tbe time the act was committed as not to inow the distinction be. tween right and wrong - and if that was not made out to their full satisfaction, they had only one duty to perform, and, however painful it might be to them to do so, they were bound to return a verdlct of " Wilful murder." The jury, after deliberating for some time in the box, retired, and were in deliberation about three-quarters of an hour, when theyreturnedwitha verdictof "Gutiltyof wilful murder," but recommended the prisoner to mercy, on account of his strong predisposition to insanity. Mr. Justice WiGnTmsm, after conferring for some time with Mr. Justice Willes, addressed the prisoner and said that the jury, who were the best judges in such a case, had come to the conclusion that, although he might be insane upon some points, he knew right from wrong, and they had recommended him to mercy. Under these cireunistances he should abstain from passing sentence of death, and merely order judgment of death to be recorded. The prisoner upon this stepped in front of the dock, and said, "I never made any defence; I never gave orders for any; what they have done they have done for themselves; I have been perured away." Be then turned round and walked from the bar. NEW COURT. (Beforc the RECORDEr-) WiDliam Maynard, 40, labourer, was indicted fot uttering aforged5l.-note. Mr. Bailey prosecuted, and .Mr. Sleigh defended. It appeared that the prisoner had changed the note at the Golden Anchor, East Greenwich, stating that he had received it in payment for some work he had done, giving the name and address of the person from whom he received it, which turned out to be untrue. He lived in the neighbourhood where it was uttered, and had not kent out of the way. He afterwards said some one had given it to him to get changed. The jury, after being locked up for five hours, returned a verdict of lNot Guilty. THIRD) COURT. (Before Anr. RUSSELL GURNEY, Q.C.J A respectable-looking ederly man named Brown, a cab proprietors surrendered to take his trial for an assault unpon a man named Carter, since dead. Mr. Robinson prosecuted, and lfr. Parry defended. The deceased man was a cabman, and upon the evening of the 6th of November last w;as with the prisoner near ing's-road, Gray's-inn-lane. Deceased was tipsy, and was following the prisoner, but did not assault bins. After followving prisoner some time prisoner turned roundand struck him avery violent blow, which felled him to the gound, and his head came in contact with the kerb, aiid he was picked up in a state of insensibility and conveyedto St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where it was found that his skull was much injured and laid entirely bare. He remained a'out a month in tle hospital, and had a fair chance of recovering, when he insted upon leaving, and, having done so, t came worse, and died, but not from the blow, The Jury returned a verdict of Guilty. The defendant was allowed to go out upon his own recognizances to come up for judgmnent when calledc-upon, it being understood that he would make Eome recompense to the widow of the deceased man. lorens Santos, 23, sailor, was convicted of cutting and wounding Johan Antonio. Mr. Orridge prosecuted, and Mr. Payne defended. The occurrence took place between the parties, who are Spanish and ltilian seamen, at a place of notoriously bad repute at Wapping, when prisoner drew his knife and stabbed prosecutor on the-head. He was sentenced to nine months? imprisonment.
POLICE. MAxSIOx-l5OUSR.w-_lliRiWicks, a person who has been occasionally employed at one of the city wharfs as a ltnmper, was brought before the LORD MLAYOR Upon the charge of having had in his possession a quantity of tobacco upon w hich duty had not been paid. There was anothec harge of a more seriouts description against the prisonernamely, that of having stolen the tobacco. Mn. Cattarns attenaed uponthe part of the ownersof the Flora the vessel in winch the bulk from which the property was believed to have been abstracted was deposited, for the purpose of watching the case, several robberies having of late been committed under circumstances involving the two offences. The Custom-house officer said,-Hnving suspicion of the prisoner I -watched, and saw him come up fronm the cabin ol the Flora. I asked him whether he had anything contraband about him s He replied that he had, and he produlced from under his clothes the tobacco I produce. I seized the tobacco, annd gave the prisoner in charge for smuggling. It was then stated tnat bales of tobacco vhich were on board had been plundered, and, upon comparison, thc tobacco which haa been taken from the prisoner was found to be exactly of the same quality, and that no doubt was entertained of the felony, but that those who were able to give evidence to that effect had left London, and could not attend for some time to substantiate that accusation.

PB Sartorius, promnoted; the -captains' pensions of 10WZ. per annum, "for good and- meritorious serviees," relinquiihed by Captains Thomas Wren Carter, GIE., Sir Thomas Sabine Paley, and Sir John indrash, llL ; the Commodore Superintendentahip of Chabtham dockyard, vcant by the promotion of Captain Cliristopher WyviU to the rank of Rear-Admiral; anid the command of Her Majesty's ship Agamemnon, 91, vacant by the promo. tion of Sir Thomas Pasley. A naval aide-de-cnaapship to the Queen also falls in by the prorfnotion of Captain WyvilL Admiral Chads wfil succeed Sir G. Sartorius in the comancd at Cork. Several important changes have lately taLen place in the Garrison General Hospital at Portsmouth. Of the old medical staff of last spring, when the ressure wais npon it, only Dr. Burgess remaims; Dr. Odell has been sent to tho Crimea; Dr. Forrest5 Deputy-Inspector, replaced him for a short time; and he, in turn, has given place to Deputy-Inspector Dr. W. Bdel an officer of 40 years' experience in the colonies. In addition, the staff now consists of one first class staff-surgeon, two second ditto, four assistantsurgeons, and two others, who were invalided and relieved from active duty. Thus the present staff is double the strenlgth of that which stood the brunt of the work in the early months of last spring. The hospital and its adjuncts are being prepared for the reception of a considerable portion of the wounded now on their way from the hospitals of the East in the Great Tasmania and other transports. The militia invalids have been transferred to the Camber Hospital, and the Garrison Hospital will in future be reserved for sick and wounded regulars only. Theinmates at present in the General Hospital are in number about 65, and several operations have lately been perfonned. The patients generaly are going on satisfactorily, except the dysentery cases, which relapse upon changes of weather. The work for the completion of the six gun and mortar boats now in course of construction at Bristol is being pushed forward day aad night. All are in fame, and the planking has been commenced. Three are being built by Messrs. Patterson and Sons, and three by Messi& Hin. The Lords of the Admiralty have tak-en into consideration the services of Commodore Shepherd, superintendent of Her Majesty's dockLard, Woolwich, and have awarded him the good service pension. Good service pensions have alsobeen conferred on Captain T. L. Massie, Captain Sidney C. Dacres, and Commander John ShrapneL. The steam transport Cumberland, with military stores for BalaPava, left Woolwich on Wednesday for Greenhithe, forthe adjustment of her compasses, The paddlewheel steamaer Dee, Master-ComminderPnllen, left the outer basin of Woolwich dockyard yesterday morning with a cargo of steam machinery and boilers for ships. fitting out at Sheerness. The Coquette, 6, despatch gunboat) Commander Risk, was yesterday morning taken from the outer basin at Woolwich to the dry dock to undergo a final inspection. The Admiralty yacht Vivid, Master-Commdnder Allen, has completed her -repairs, and is equipped in the mostsumptuous style for the peculiar services in which she issubjectto be engaged. The crew of the surveying-vessel Spitfire, Captain Spratt, were yesterday morning paid off at Woolwich, the Spitfire-. having been in commission four years and a-half on surveyson the coast of the Mediterranean. She has been dismantled and stripped for repairs.
