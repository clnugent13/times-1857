Fzom Jamaica our advices extend to the 10th inst. The Legislature was not in session, and Mlajor-General Bell had been sworn in to administer the Government during the absence of Governor Barkly, upon leave for six months. General tranquillity prevailed. The island was generaly healthy, and matters connected with the commercial world appeared to assume a more lively aspect than they had for some time past. The Supreme Court was sitting at Spanish Town, and the Hon. Bryan Edwavrds had taken his seat as chief justice for the first time, associated with the Hon. Messrs. Wilkinson, Lewis, and Cargill. The appointment of the latter gentleman to the bench did not appear to give much satisfaction. Great quantities of rain had fallen, which had rendered the roads almost impassable in places. There was little change in comme-cial affairs. Receipts of American butter had been very large, which had completely checked the upward tendency in prices. The market was quiet for Irish, and 140 firkins of Halifax which had arrived had not been sold. Approvedbrands of brandy were sold at 18s. to 19s., but other qualities were quite neglected. Cheese was in abundant supply. A plentiful supply of Liverpool stoved salt was in the market, but very little sugear. Exchanges on London were quoted, for bills at 90 days, 1 per cent. premium; 60 days, 1 ditto; 30 days, 2 per cent. Merchants' bills were at par. At Demerara the care of the military buildings in George-town is transferred to the colonial Government, the Lords of the Treasury agreeing to plaw at the disposal of the Governor 4,0001. per annum to keep them in repair. A motion was made to the effect that the roads should be taken under the superintendence of the colony, but it was lost. Mleasures were forthwith to be introduced before the Court of Policy to provide for the better regulation of the villages, for the sappression of vagrancy, and for the registration of the people. Her Majesty's Government had called for returns of the exports and imports of the colony. The commission appointed to investigate the Portuguese claims for compensation for the losses sustained durino the late riots had agreed that the amount wotl7d not exceed $2W0,000. The Combined Court had declined the offer of the Home Government to send a competent geologist and mineralogist, on the ground that his services wvere not required by the colony. The northern portion of George-town was again threatened with an irruption from the sea, in a different direcition from that wich oceurred two years ago, but measures were being taken to prevent it. The Devonshire had arrived from Madras with 324 coolies on board. Smallpox broke out during the voyage, but abated before the ship's arrival. Abundance of rain had fallefn since the dry w,eather, and the canes were in a very thriving state. The planters everywherewere verybusyinimaking sugar. The exports during the fortnight were exceedingly limited. The ship Bellona, fromn Liverpool, and the Eliza Bai, Gipsy Queen, Adelaide, and Caledonia, from London, had arrived at Demerara. At Grenada the weather was favourable, and the crops were improving. Labour was wantecl to repair the injury done to the young canes, owing to the previous dryvweather. The sugar crop had been all but gathered in throughout the island, there only remaining upon some estates pieces of canes reserved for the supplying of plants on the setting in of rain. There had been despatched eight vessels to Europe witha produce, which, with small parcels to the sister colonies and other parts, brought the amowunt shipped fromr the 1st of January to the 2d inst. to 1,77Ohhds. 356tierces, 624Ã¯Â¿Â½ barrels, and 2)6 bags sugar; 523 pumcheons, 41hhds., 12 qr.-casks, and 8 demijohns rum; 49 puncheons molasses; 5,678 bags cocoa; 127 bales of cotton, 9,200 cocoanuts, and several boxes and barrels of nutmegs and mace. The cocoa crop was likely to be much deteriorated by the invasion of an insect of the beetle kind which had already caused serious injury to cocoa pieces in different parts of the island, by catting off the circulation of sap and killing the trees. From St. Lucia we learn that the weather had changed from dry to wet, and the crops had to some extent been saved in consequence. At Trinidad, also, rain had fallen in abundance. The cropshad beensavedin fine condition, andabout 30,000 hogsheads of sugarhadbeen made. Lieutenant Jones, 69th Regiment, stationed at Trinidad, had committed suicide by stabbing himself. The West India islands generally are reported as healthy, buit there is no other news of importance. About the 2d inst. there arrived at Vera Cruz a Spanish squadron of nine vessels of war, and demanded payment of the money owing from the Mexican Government to Spain. In default they threatened to land and take possession of the Custom-house, and pay themselves out of the receipts. The following were the stations of Her Mlajesty's and other ships :-June 13, at Trinidad, the Arachne, having conveyed the mails from'Barbadoes to that place, in consequence of Her Majesty's ship Wye getting onshore. June 14, at St. Lucia, the Scorpion. June 10, at Guadaloupe, the French War steamer Lo Grondeur and the Tonnerre. June 5, at Greytown, Her Majesty's ship Eurydice. Arrived at Navy Bay the United States' steam frigate Susquehamna, 16 guns, Commodore Paulding, and sailed the same day for Greytown. On May 12, Her MIajesty's ship Monarch, RearAdmiral Bruce, sailed from Callao for the Sandwich Islands, and on Mlay 24 the French frigate Perseverance sailed for Tahiti. Jume 8, at Panama, the United States' frigate St. lary's. HerMajesty'ssteamerEermes, 6 guns, arrived at Port Royal, on the 8th inst., from Navy Bay. June 11, Her 3Majesty's ship EspiRgle, 12 guns, and the Imaum were at Port Royal. Her Majesty's ship Vestal was cruising among the Windsrard S!ands. June 8, Her Majesty's steamer Termagant,Commodore Kellett, sailed on a cruise; and Her Majesty's ship Malacca had received her crew from the shore, and sailed on a cruise; the crew had aU been sickly and landed.

Lord LYNDBHRST.-A short time since I asked my nobl3 friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he would lay on the table of the house the correspondence which was understood to be going on relative to the a.ffatrs of Italy. Since that period my noble friend has on two separate occasions stated that correspondence was going on with the Courts of Naples and other European Powars upon the affairs of Italy. As far as Naples is concerned, that correspondenceis, I presume, at anend, and I fear is at an end without any satisfactory result. I form that opion from what has been passing at some recent trials, which have disclosedproceedingsof amostscandalous nature; such as, for instance, ministers of religion being stripped of their religious dress and threatened with imprisonment, and threatened with the infEiction of lashes unless they consented to giire evidence against the accused. Looking at the whole course of these proceedings, they appear to be a mere duplicate of those which took place upon the trial of Poerio, of whichi my right hon. friend the member for thq University of Oxford has given so graphic a description. My lords, it appears to me, as far as I can collect, that the whole Goveanment of Naples is in the hands of police agents, spies, and informers, andI begin to despair of the state of things in that Country. I beg to ask my noble friend, whether he is prepared to lay upon the table copies of any correspondeuce which may have passed between this Government and the Government of hraples and other European Powers wiith respect to the aff'airs of Italy ? The Earl of CLARENDON.-My lords, I cannot at p resent inform my noble and learned frienid whether it WMil be in the power of Her Majesty's Governmnet to layupon the table the correspondence to which ho has alluded. That correspondence, as respects Naples, has not yetbeen brought to a close. We have not received any answer to a despatch communicated by H er Majesty'sGovernment, in conjunction vith that of the Emperor of the French, to the Neapolitan G ovenment. The 1ing of Naples was absent from Naples at the time. He returned for a few days, and I have reason to believe that while he was in Naples lie ordered that an answer should be returned. That reply will be probably communicated in a few days through the Neapolitan Ministersin London and Paris. That answer has not, however, been received, and until it is, and until the Government determine what steDs it may be necessary to take in respect to that answer, ny noble friend will understand that it would be premature to lay it upon the table. With respect to the correspondence between this and other Governments on the affairs of Italy, it is perfectly. true that Her Majesty's Government have offerea their opinion and advice to those Powers, in whose occupation a certain portion of the Papal territory has been; but I do not Imow that the object that my noble and learned friend has at heart is likely to be served by producing that correspondence at present. The only result would be to check that friendly and confidential communication which is now going on, and from which some good may be expected. Your lordships must be aware that to create the state of things which would render the withdrawal of those foreign. armies safe must be a work of some time. I can therefore only hope that my noble and learned friend will accept nmy assurance that nothing that can possibly be done by Her M1ajesty's Government has been or will be neglected to procure the cessation of that foreign occupation. I believe that the Governments of France and Austria both desire to withdraw their troops from the Papal territory, and that the Papal Government are not indisposed to give their assent to the withdrawal of those troops as soon as a small military division arrives which the Pope is now organizing. Lord LYNDHURST.-Will my noble friend lay the answer, of the Neapolitan Government upon the table as soon as it arrives? The Earl of CLARENT)DON.-Until I see the nature of the reply I canuot give an answer to my noble and learned friend; but he can take an opportunity of repeat:ng his question. OATH OF ABJIURATION AMENDMIENT BILL. The Earl of DERBY.-Before the orders of the day are taken I wish to say a few words on a bill which I have introI duced, and which stands for a third reading on Thursday. This is a bil for amending the oath of abjuration, or, as my noble and learned friend may like it better, the oath "commonly called the oath of abjuration." That bill was introduced to effect an object which all your lordships desire, viz., the abrogation of certain portions of that oath which, having become obsolete, are useleEs, and being useless are offensive. I was in hopes that that biU might have befm discussad without reference to another question immediately connected with it, since it wvas framed so -as to avoid any reference to that subject. But the character of the comments made upon the bill in its progress through this House-of which I think I have some cause to complain-the misconstruction of which it has been tne objetand the intention xpressed by a very high and much respected authority-de dyie me of that hope, and forbid me to expect that it wiile received in another place in the same spirit in which I have brought it forward. I desired to introduce that measure in a spirit of peace and conciliation; but I have been met in a spirit of defiance and hostility. f am charged with having nromoted the renewal of discussions on a subject el to produce considerable irritation, whereas the whole and sole object I had in view in intreducing that biU was sedulously to avoid the recurrence of that subject. In the present state of the publc mind I can have no hope that the bill will succeed elsewhere. I wil not, as far as I am concerned, beansewerable for re-introducingan irritating topic, on which the two Houses are at variance ; but, looking at the probability of the bill leading to itseonvenient discussion at the present period of the session, I shall ask- your lordships' permission to move to discharge the order for the third reading, whichstands on thepaper for Thursday next. (Hear.) In doing so, I must, however, be permitted to sav there remains the firm conviction in my mind that the bill in the state in which I introduced it is the only mode of abrogating these obsolete oaths. If, for the future, oaths, objectionable in character, and which every one desires to get rid of, are retained, I beg I may not be considered responsible for their retention. (Hear, hear.) I am anxious to get rid of those oaths, and the responsibility of retaining them must rest on those who vill carry no bill for their abrogation, unless they can tack on to it an entirely distinct provision which your lordships have repeatedly exressed -our determination conscientiously to refuse. (Eear, hear.) lnhe noble earl concluded by moving that the order for the third reading of the Oath of Abjuration Amendment Bill be discnarged. Lord LYNDHURST, after presenting a petition from the Lordj Mayor and Sheriffs against the bill, said,-I will not enter again into the discussion of the question, hut the noble earl complains of the course which I pursued. I have much more reason to complain of him, because on a former occasion, in terms not of the usual courtesy, he charged me, not with misapprehension, but with misrepresentation. Tho comments vzhich I used were perfectly legitimate and consistent wvith the usual character of proceedings in your lordships'house. Lord CAMPBELL.-I should bo glad to have this oath abolished, as it is my painful duty often to listen to the profanation which the taking it involves, but the noble earl opposite has done weU to withdraw his bill, as no good can possibly arise either to the cause which I have at heart-the abolition of the oath-or to that which is the nohle and learned lord's object-the removal of disabilities in the way of the Jews. In all probability, the bill would have been returned to this House in such a state as to make it identical Iwith the bill your lordships have rejected. I do not vish to see any such confict between the two Houses, because I hope to see the time when, with the assent of both, justice may be done. Nor do I wish that the Honse of Commons should take upon themselves by resolution to alter the law of the land. (Hear, hear.) As the law stands the Jews are excluded from sitting in either house of Parliament, because they will not take the oath of abjuration; and it is only by act of Parliament that the law can be altered. (EHear, hear.) The Earl of MAIMESBDRY.-If, the other night, I regretted this bill was not discussed in the plain sense of the words employed, and that the noble and learned lord should I aestte example of attributing motives to my noble. |friend behind me, of which he has just denied the existence, -I say, if I regretted that course the other night, I regret it stil more now, when the noble and learned lord- Lord LYNDHURST, rising and intersupting the noble earl.-I said, Ithought he was under a mistake asto the real effectof the bilL~ The Earl of KALM&ESBURY.-The House must have understood the noble and learned lord to argue 9uite as much upon the consequences of this bill with regara to the admission of Jews as he did upon the plain sense of the words or the bill itself; and I say, if I regretted then that he departed from the straightforward course of arguing the merits of the bill as it stood before your lordships, without entering upon the discussion of a subject which had been decided only two nights previously, I more regret now thathe should have repeated that line of arwment immediately after my noble friend had withdrawn his baill. I regret that the example of deviating from the straightforward course should havd been set by so eminent and illustrious a peer, but I hope the maxim will applydecipit exeeipter ithus insaibile I athdLYoDg 3 SlTJ.-What I complained of was, that although the words of abjuration were omitted, the 'whole sting remained, because "the trae faith of a Christian" would stiU have formed part of the oath. The sending such a biU down to the other Rouse, after they had sent a bill here in vwhich those words were carefully excluded, would not have been very acceptable to them2. (Hear, hear.) The M1arquis of CLANRICAJDE.-I am sure the common sense of Parliament and of the country will not permit the maintenance of this absurd and irreverent oath. It ought not to be remodelled ; it ought to be abolished. If you will have an oath at all, have an oath of allegiance and fidelity in plain simple terms, which ever-ygood subject can take, whatever mnay be bla religon; and if you choose to ex elude Jewrs and infidels, make the oath in such terms as every denomination of Christians can take it. You ought not to continue this absurd oath, because incidentally it has the effect of excluding the Jews. The motion was agreed to, and the order discharged. 'The Banliruptey (Scotland) Bill was read a third time and passed. SUIBSCRIPTIONS BY THE E:AST INDIA COMIPANY. 'The Maruis of CLARICADE askred whether the sum of 56X. lafely subscribed by the Chairman of Directors of the EasG India Comwnhiun-aidiof the sufferft byinun4ations in France had been supplied by proprietors of East India Stock or had been taken from the public revenues of Her Majesty's possessions in India; and, in the latter case whether subscriptions, grants, or gratuities, not exceeding 600!,, taken from Indian revenues, are subject to the control of Parliament or of 'Her Majesty's Government,- or are limited by any fixed regulation 1 If that money was (as he suspected) to-be paid from the public revenues of India, he xmusb say that he regarded such a course as alike improper and unconstitutionaL He understood that the Board of Directors claimed a right to expend suns not exceeding 600. without receiving the sanction of any authority, and based that claim upon the terms of the 8Sth section of the act of 1813. Itmust,however,beremembsredthatin l813 the reve-- nuesof Indiawerethepropertyof theEastIndiaCompany,but since 1833 those revenues had passed from the hands of the Company and were now administered by the Indian Government. In the present case the pmrposeforwhich the money was voted could notbe objected to, but, if the power claimed by the Board of Directors as yielded to them, they would have the power of voting sums to every charity in London, and at the same time of exercising their generosity, not at the expense of the East India Compauy, whose receipts would not be at all affected by them, but at the cost of the Indian Government, out of whose revenues those payments were to be made. The Duke of -ARGYLL inferred, from the terms of the notice, that the object of the noble marquis was rather to express an opinion than to eLcit- information; he should therefore confine himself to the question pat down on the paper. The vote of 500!. by the Court of Directors towards reieving the sufferers from the inundations in France was a vote of money from the revenue of India. That vote had received the sanction of the President of the Beard of Control, who had it in his power to negative it if he had thought it right to do so. There were no abstract rules laid down with respect to such votes, but it had been the custom of the East India Company from time to time to subscribe small. sams for various charitable purposes. This they had done under the powers of their aot of Parliament, and he for one -fully appioved it. His noble friend was of opinion that the Ea3st India Company ought not to possess that power. That m ight ho a; question when techarter ame again under discussion, but -at present no doubt existed that they did possess such a power. He died not think any one would question the legitimacy of the object of the vote, nor the wisdonm of the derision come to by his riglht hon. friend the President of the Board of Control, under the existing circumstances of the case and the esingrelations between this country and France. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH said that, as he under. stood tlhe act of Parliament, the concurrence of the President of the Board of Control in this grant could not possibly have the effect of making it legal. It was not the relic of ancient power, it was a relic of ancient practice. Previous to the act of 1833 the Courb of Directors possessed the revenue of India as their own property, andthey might then have legally expended their money in these subscriptions. But the act of 1833 entirely changed the nature of their connexion with India. All 'their property was taken from them. They sold it for an annuity, and that annuity was to a certain degree guaranteed by Parliament. They, therefore, had no interest in India, except that given to them by the act of 1833. The act made them trustees for the Crown, for the purpose of discharging the duties of the Government of India. They were trustees for that office only, and no expenditure made by them could be legal which was not clearly and evidently for the service of the Government of India. But could it be pretended that this subscription for the relief of the sufferers from the inundations in France was for the service of India ? Many of the expenses incurred by the Court of Directors were iUegal, according to the strict interpretation of the act of 1833. It was not, however, under any clause in the act of 1833 that the Court of Directors would attempt to nst this application of their funds. By the act of 1873 the Court of Directors were directed to submit to the Board of Control an estimate of the gross sum annually reouired for the payment of the salaries of the court and of the officers and servants thereof, and of all other proper expenses. This sum might be vaxied from time to time. The Board of Control might refuse to acquiesce in the suma demanded, giving their reasons for it; but the suns having been once granted the board could not interfere as to the manner in which it might be expended. Yow, many of these gross abuses and illegalities had been continued in consequence of the Court of Directors not having sent in new estimates of the annual expenses; and also in consequence of the Board of Control not having struck out, when such estimates were before them, expenses which might have been proper before the act of iS33 was passed, but which were iUegal subsequently to that act. He thought it, therefore, possible that this sum of 500I. might have been taken from a balance of the sum annualBy granted by the Board of Control for the expenses of the Court of Directors. But it was not merely to a subscription to assist the sufferers from the inundations of France, or to subscriptions to many excelent charities in this country, that he objected; but it was to the large expenses frequently incurred by the Court of Directors, which they ought no longer to be permitted to incur, that ho entertained the strongest objections. What would their lordships thinkc of a Secretary of State of this country, on the examinatien of the cadets at Sanchurst or at Wooivwich, invitin"g 40 or 50O officers to go down", undertakini' to pay all their expenses, and giving them a magn5iicent dinner on their arrival? WFould the Htouse of Commons tolerate an estimate of an expense incuzred for such a purpese? Theirlordships knew they wvould not. Her Majesty's Ministers, at the commencement of the late war, thought it expedient to inaugurate that war by a grand dinner at the Reform Club, at which the naval department was most especially exalted; but he apprehended that the expense of that dinner never appeared in the naval estimates to bo paid for by the country. Neither would the arny estimates, he ventured to say, include the expense of the dinner to be gi.en by the Secretary of War to Sir William Codrington, on his return from the Crimea. It wias not for the benefit of the Government of India that these expenses should be incurred. The serv.ce of that Government was not the object of such expenditure. But the Court of Directors seemed to be of the same opinion as Louis XIV., and appeared to conceive that "they were the State." It was not the first time that he had caUed the attention of Her Majesty's Government to this subject, and he did earnestly entreat the Government to consider whether a bill ought not to be brought in forthwith for the purpose of establishing an independent auditor of the accounts of the East India Company. (Hear, hear.) It was really too bad that 23,000,000?. should be expended year after year without any independent audit whatever-with no audit but that 'which was under the control and influenlce of the very persons by whom the money was expended. Their lordships would not be acting honestly towards the people of India unless they adopted a different course. He therefore did trust that the Government would not allow this session to pass without introducing a bill for the purpose of putting an end to that most injurious system. (Hear, hear.) JOINT-ST<OCK COMPANIES BILL. This bil was read a third time and passed with certain amendments. The Stock in Trade Bill was read a second time. ANNUITIES REDEMPTION BILL. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY moved the third reading of this biUl; but on the suggestion of Lord MIoNTxEA-GLE it was postponed till Thursday next. The Industrial and Provident Societies Bill and the Seamen's Savings Banks Bill were read the third time and passed. The Survey of Great Britain, &c., BilU was read the second time. THE LATE CAPTAIN THOMPSON. The Earl of MALMESBURY inquired what steps the Government had taken to assist the mother of the late Captain Thompson, one of the heroes of Ears? The Marqtuis of LANSDOWNE, who was almost inaudible, was understood to say, that measures were being taken to assist the lady in question, partly by the Waroffice, and partly in another way. Their lordships adjourned at 10 minutes to 7 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, Monday, June 30. ? The Speaker took the chair at 4 o'clock. The North-Western Railway Bill and the Luton District Road (No. 2) Bill were read a third time and passed.

Petitions were also presented by Mr. Warren, from the mayor, magistratef, bankers, merchants, and inhabitants of Hull, very numerously and influentially signed, against depriving the incorporated city of London of any of its rights and estates; by Mr. W. BROWN, from the guardians of the poor of the West Derby Union, Lancashire, praying that the contributors should have the right of electing those who have the disbursement of county rates; also from inhabitants of Acerington, praying for the early adoption of a decimal system of coinage and accounts; by Mr. FOLEY, from the. medical officers of the Shipstonon-Stonr Union, praying for a redress of grievances; by Lord Goderich, from the Huddersfield Chamber of Commerce, praying for certain amendments in the Countrv Courts Act Amendment Bill; by Admiral WALCOTT, from the inhabitants of Christchnrch, Hampshire, in favour of the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill; by Mr. OLIVEIRA (signed by upwards of 7.000 inhabitants of tho Potteries in St.-uTordshire), praying that the duty upon foreign wines should be reduced, and expressing a hope that, if such reduction were effected, foreign countries would lower theiitariff npon pottery, which would add to the prosperity and improve the trade of thoso districts; by Sir J. Waxmslby, from the medical officers of th© Chesterfield Union, praying for a redress of those grievances by which they have been so long oppressed, as set forth in the petition of the 30th of May from a publicmeeting of the officers of the Poor Law unions, the Earl of Shaftesbury in the chair ; by Mr. Hankey, from West Cowes, in favour of theLocalDues'Biil; by Mr. Bakes, from the Leeds Chamber of Commerce, for ine abolition of the Sound dues; by Mr. Tollemacee, from Birkenhead, in favour of extending the power of County Courts incases of "debt; from Over, against the abolition of church-rates ;Jby Mr. M'MAHON, from theLocal Board of Health of the district of Bursiem, in the couniy of Stafford, in favour of ihe Public Health Act Amendment BUl, bnt suggesting amendments in a few of the clauses; also from the same body in favour of the rating of Mines Bill; also from the Town Commissioneis of Enniscorthy, in the county of Wexford, praying that the. principle, of the poor law system shonld be applied. to the countv-rates and that one-half thereof should be bome by the "landlords; by Mr. BdtlER, from the guardians of the poor of Hackney Union, stating that their attention had of late years been directed tothe largo increase nnder the head of county rates, snd -praying tho House to adopt measures for establishing an efficient audit of the county funds; by Sir HJ Strace^ fromthe guardians of the AyfshamUnion, inthe county of Norfolk, against the Tithe Commissioners Renicharges Bill; by Mr. Starkie, from the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the borough of Clitheroe, praying for the establishment of the decimal system of comage and accounts, from the medical officers of tho Clitheroe Union, praying for a redress of grievances; and by Mr. Wickhstm, from the inhabitants of Hartshead-eum-C3ifton, praying that no alteration may be made in the lawrelationg to the observance of the Sabbath. GREECE. Mr. JAMES 1TGREGOR asked whether the Government were prepared to lay on the table of the House the correspondence respecting the relations between this counfrry and Greece whichnad taken place subsequently to that already laid beforeParliament extending to May, 1854 2 Lord PALSIEBSTON said that there were no particular Snesiions pending between this country and Greece during ke period to which the question related. A great many reports of what was called in foreign language "brigandage" had been received, but there was no question pending requiring papers to be brought forward. NATIONAL GALLERY SITE BILL. Mr. SPOONER inquired whether the Government intended to proceed with the National GaUery Site BUl after the vote of last Friday? Lord PALMEESTON replied thai, after the vote of last Friday, the Government wonld not proceed with the bill, at aU events for this ssssion. He should move thai the order for the second reading be discharged. (Hear, hear.) The order was then read and discharged. DESTRUCTION OF THE FORTS ISMAIL AND RENI Colonel DUNNE inquired whether the Government had received any infonnation of the destruction of tho forts of Ismail and Reni ? Lord PALMEESTON said that the Government had no positive information on the subject; but he believed that the Russians coaceived themselves at liberty to destroy the worksaUuded to; but he should hardly think they would deem it worth while to do so, for the only result of such a proceeding would bo to impose on the Turks a certain expense for re-establishing the forts when they came into possession of the ceded territory. RETIREMENT OF BISHOPS. Mr. GREGSON asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether it was in contemplation of the Government to prorWse any plan for the retirement of bishops on pensions, sirnUar to the arrangements for colonial bishops, Lord ChanceUors, Judges, and Ministers of State ? . Lord PALMERSTON replied that it was not his intention at present to propose any general act on the subject; but the Bishops of London and Durham, having signified their desire to retire in consequence of infirmities incapacitating them from the satisfactory discharge of their functions, he should propose a biU limited to those two particular cases. 'IRISH MTT.TTIA. Mr. DAVTSONinquired whether any'particular time had been fixed for the disembodiment of the Irish militia ? Lord PALMERSTON thought he had already stated that the head of the War Department had requested the Lard Lieutenant to use his discretion in fixing the time for the disembodiment of the different Irish nuUtia regiments, so that they might not be kept embodied -unnecessarily with a view to economy; and that the period of their disembodiment in different parts of thecountry should be made to coincide as far as possible with the commencement of agricultural operations. PURCHASE OF COMMISSIONS. In reply to Major Reed, Mr. PEEL said, that the commission of inquiry on the system, of purchase of commissions in ihe army was sitting and carrying on its investigations. APPELLATE JURISDICTION BILL. In reply to Sir J. Graham, Lord PALMERSTON said, he intended io fix the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill for Monday next, and the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill for next Thursday. CORRUPT PRACTICES BILL. SirF. KELLY asked when the second reading of this bUl would be moved? Lord PALMEESTON said, the hon. gentleman should have timely notice of tha day. ROYAL ASSENT. Mr. P0LTMAN, Yeomaxi Usher of the Black Rod, summoned the House to attend in the House of Lords to hear tha Royal assent given io certain bills, a list of which wiU ba found in our report of the proceedings inthe House of Lords. On the return of the Speaker, the House proceeded to the orders of the day. SUPPLY. THE AMERICAN QUESTION. On the question that ihe Speaker shonld leave ihe chair in order thatthe Housesliould go into Committee of Supply, being put, Mr. G. MOORE rose to move the resolution with regard to the American question of which he had given notice. Mr. W. BROWN rose at the samo time, and appealed to his hon. friend not io proceed with his motion. (Hear. hear.) There was a strong feeling both in that house and in the country that themattershonld be left in the hands ofthe Government and the American Minister now in England, in order that the differences which had unfortunately arisen between the two countries might be adjusted. (Hear, hear.) He had no doubt that, unless some cause of frritation shonld arise, these disputes would be amicably arranged to the satisfaction of both parties. (Hear, hear.) He thought ii would be unwise to discuss any supposed fault or irregularity in the arrangement of pubhc affairs so long as negotiationswerependingand tho mouths of Ministers were shut, so that they could not givo answers which they would otherwise be able to make. Under these circumstances, he must decidedly but respectfully appeal to his hon. friend the member for Mayo (Mr. Moore) not to proceed with his motion at the present time. (Hear, hear.) Mr. CHEETHAM joined in the appeal whioh had been made by his hon. colleague (Mr. Brown). He believed that the -negotiations between ihe two countries were at the present moment in a favourable condition, and, as he was sure that the hon. gentleman would not wish to arrest the progress of those negotiations, he (Mr. Cheetham) hoped that he would not press his motion, Mr. J. EWART said thai there was among his constituency a strong feeling that nothing ought tobe said or done in that honse which would in the slightest degree interfere ?with those negotiations for a pacific solution of the difficulties between this country and America which were, he believed, now going on. He therefore heartUy concurred in the appeal which his hon. friends near hirnhad addressed to the hon. member for Mayo (Mr. G. Moore.) Mr. SPOONER said that tbe feeling against a discussion upon the American qnestion was not confined io laverpool It was very general. ("Hear, hear," and a slight laugh from the Opposition benches.) Hon. gentlemen near him inight laugh, and it was always with the greatest diffidence ihat he differed from his hon. friends round him, but ha did deprecate discussion on this subject. (Ministerial cheers.) No possible good could arise from, it; but it might be followed by difficulties and evils of the greatest magnitude. The hon. gentleman the member for Mayo (Mr. Moore) said by liis motion that the Government had not deserved the approbation of the Eouse. Had they asked for it? (Hear, hear.) All they said was, "Wait, and see .what we do." (Laughter.) Ho gave no opinion upon iheir conduct; he was not prepared to give such an opinion. An hon. gentleman near him said that ho ought to be; he had formed an opinion, but he was not prepared to express it. (A laugh from the Opposition, and cheers from the Ministerial benches.) He was prepared to support his party as far as any man, but ho would not surrender his own opinion when he was convinced that by so doing he should run the risk of inflicting a great injury upon his couniry. (Cheers.) What good could arise from a discussion of ihis question at the present moment? The American Government had acquitted that of Her Majesty, and had said thai they had no fault to find with it, but, unfortunately, they had some dislike to our Minister at Washington. Were members prepared to bring on at the present moment a discussion which wonld endanger amicable rela. tions between the two countries? (Cries of " Oh, oh I" and " No, no !") Let not hon. gentlemen deceive themselves. If this discussion went on expressions might be used, false estimates of the opinion of that House and of the couatry might be formed, which might, ihey knew not how much, embarrass and delay ihe Government in carrying on negotiations for ihe settlement of our differences with America. In his opinion Ministers had better preserve a complete and perfect sUence. (Cheers and a laugh.) Hon. gentlemen might laugh, but the country would bs exceedingly sorry if anything should escape from Ministers which should render probable a contest with America. The Ministers had upon their shoulders a great re-iponsibUity, in which ho recommended the House not to share. If the discussion should be carried on, and there shonld arise difficulties which should prevent ihe completion of a treatyj the Government would say that i_ was aU the fault of tho House-they were going on smoothly, when the Houso stepped in and took the matter out of their hands. He therefore urged the hon. member to stop, and implored his hon. friends to pause, before they sanctioned: the progress "of this discussion. For his own part, he was not prepared to support any pro.' posal which could have the effect of weakening the hands of the Government at so critical» juncture, or of incapacitating them from bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the dispntes unhappuy pending between this counti-y and America. (Laughter.) Ee was not to he laughed down, nor should ridicule deter .him from giving f earless expression to his honest convictions. (laughter.) He by no Bt-s desired to identify himself with the policy of the Government, ot to express any opinion on it one way or the ether, bctife' was essential to the welfare of the oonnfry ihat th«x should not be embarrassed at such a moment. Shonld ?wt-, unfortunately, be plunged into war, wo shonld be ready toprotect our rights and to defend our honour and *3ignityj; hut, circumstanced as we were at the present moment, th«" better course would ba io abstain from discussion. On every consideration cf public honour and of patriotism, and \yf his sense of what he owed alike to his country, to tha* House, *-& to himself, he conjured the hon, member for; Mayo not io persevere in his motion. (Cheers.} Mr. G. H. MOORE ssid ihat the opinion of tbe hojmember fer North Warwickshire must necessarily hava great weight with him on any subject, but more particularly on the subject of excitingiU-will and disunion among varioua classes, sects, and communities. (Cheers andlaughter.) Ha regretted, however, that he could not be guided by iis counsels on ihe present occasion. With regard to the ion» members who had appealed to him from the opposite sida of the house, he was bound to listen with great resrpect to any* admonition that might come from them; bnt iE this instance he must refer ihem for a reply to ihe observations wbich he had made upon this same subject on Friday evening, and which the hon. gentlemen wouldiavo the candour to admit ihey had not refuted. The hon. memberfor Nortlt Warwickshire had spoken of tliis as of a party question. [" Hear, hear," from Mr. Spooner.] The form of the notice nnght, no donbt, ba correctly described as that o£ a party motion, but the question involved was cna which ought to be decided by that Honse without! ihe slightest reference to party considerations, and in it thoroughly judicial spirit. It was a question of righfc and wrong which had arisen between the Governments o£ two great countries, and which, in his view of the matter, had been settled on a basis of present dissatisfaction and o£ fnture danger, as regarded ihe feelings and opinions of th» people of loth nations (hear, hear), inasmuch as ithad! been left to be arranged by ihe wrongdoers themselves, on the principlo of saving iheir own character, or, at all events, their own position, at the expense of the national honour, which it was iheir duty to have guarded. In so far as suc& a proposition must, if entertained by theHouse, affect the position of Her Majesty's Government, it might truly* enough be termed "a party question," but most assuredly it was one which onght io be judged by the House without regard to party consequences, and npon considerations thei highest, widest, and most extensive which could govern the opinions of men. There were no circumstances which ought to be watched by Parliament with more vigUant and amdous attention ihan those whieh affected our relations with a, people who, sprung from our own soU, spoke the same langaage, were governed by the same institutions, swayed by the same motives, and inspired by the same great instincts as ourselves. (Hear, hear.) And no portion of her destiny should Englsnd cherish with more hope and pride than to be loved andhonoured by that great community of nations of her own blood and race who, graduaUy multiplying, were covering the earth with their cities, ihe sea with their Seets^ and who carried with them wherever they weni the energyandtheenterprise,theaU-conqneringwUlandtheindoY>iitablai self-reliance of thegreatpeople from whom they hadspr-ig« (Cheers.) Although we had lost the government of thaUnited States, as we might hereafter be doomed to lose thatof other nations which might grow ioo powerful to admit p£" their being ruled by other hands than iheir own, we oughtnever io surrender-never to lei lapse by any fault of ours our right to their reverence and allegiance, and our title to - be regarded as the head of their race, the centre of their civilisation, the fountain of their inspirations, and the standaiS of what every nation ought tobe in principle, poUcy, and conduct. And whatever might be the faults and follies of the American people, he beUeved ihem to be a people o£' wise and sagacious as weU as ardent inspirations ; and that - there was no stronger impulse in the heart of an American than an instinctive admiration of the old country, an4 an intuitive desire for brotherly association with her chUdren.-. Bnt it was not tobe wondered at if America shouldgrowgraduaUytiied of anattachment which was repelled, if not repudiated, and if she should become dissatisfied with an alliance which was occasionally ungracious, exacting, and inconsiderate. There was nothing which reqnired to be watched with greater attention ihan the growth of such a feehng in ths public mind of America, for in our transactions with that . country our only policy was io compel their respect.. (Hear, hear.) As regarded our political, and diplomatic relations, they rested on ihe foundations of truth antS honour, of fair dealing and open speaking, and to abandon those principles wonld be to loosen ihe bonds o£ union between both countries and to expose each to a com-- mon calamity. A weU-founded distrust on ihe part of ' America in our character for integrity and veracity would be the most disastrous circumstance, the direst misfortune -that could possibly bef aE this country, and it was because ? the English Govemmenihad, in his opinion, justly forfeited the respect and esteem of the people and Government of ' America that he deemed it to be the duty of thai House to declare, at once, thai, for the foUy and weakness which had led to that result, and which, if persevered in, might lead to consequences stUl more lamentable, ihe people of England were in no degree responsible (hear, hear); and that ihey had had no act or part in bringing abont a . state of things which it was impossible io regard with other ? feelings than those of sorrow and solicitude. The issues . raised by this question were neither to be mistaken nor evaded. They had been fairly and thus accurately stated ? by Lord Clarendon himself in one of his despatches.-- "The real questions at issue between Her Majesty's Government and that of the United States are, whether the British Government ordered or contemplated-anyvio- - iation ofthe neutrality laws ofthe United States; whether,. if theBritish Governmentdidnot order orcontemplatesuch . violation, those laws were nevertheless violated by persons acting with the authority or approbation of the British Govemment i" On these two points he was prepared to join issue with Ker Majesty's Government, and he would undertake to make it ? clear that the neutrality laws of the United States had been grossly and deliberately outraged by persons acting with tho consent and approbation of the Government, and ihat tho Government did contemplate and sanction the violation of those laws. - He was aware ihat the American Government ? had in their last despatch offered with contemptuous courtesy to separate these two propositions-that was to say, to separate the respoiiability of Lord Clarendon and of ihe Government from that of Mr, Crampton; but, howeverwell that diplomatiefictionmiglit suit the purposeof the American Government, it could not be accepted by the British otherwise than at the expense of their own truth and honesty. That distinstion of the American Government was based on the disputed avowal of Mr. Crampton, and on the distinct avowal of Lord Clarendon, that Mr. Crampton was enjoined io act aboveboard and to have no concealment with tho United States. For his own part he cared not to consider - whether Her Majesty's Government had or hadnot thought - Eroper in iheir iast despatch to ride off on ihat assumption. E they had it would avaU ihem nothing, for it could be dis- - tinctly shown that Mr. Crampton had perfonned the duty indicated to him by Lord Clarendon, that he had acted ' on that interpretation ofthe law which had received tbe sanction of Lord Clarendon, and that from first to last he had . pnisned a course which had been authorized, accredited, andl. defended by Lord Clarendon. As for Lord Clarendon having deprecated a violation of the American law, so too had Mr. Crampton ; but both insisted with equal pertinacity on placing upon that law a perverse construction which had led to its being violated, anet. in that respect they were both equally blameable. But althongh our Government might be in » position to,. assert that the disavowal of Mr. Crampton's acts (which the. American Government assumed) did hot rest upon an.explicit declaration of their own, it was not so in regard to thoassurance given by Lord Clarendon to which he had already ref erred, and wiiich the American Government accepted in,. explanation. Lord Claiendon, writing to Mr. Buchanan at. the beginning of the controversy, expressly declared that - Mr. Crampton was enjoined above all to practise no concealment with the American Government. This^declaraticn had been accepted by the United States' Government; tlsey had made the most effective nse of it from one end of-thecorrespondence to the other, and it had been quoted Tfith. triumph by Mi'. Marcy ih his last despatch. Mr. Marcy ? said:- - . " If Mr. Crampton believed that what he ms doing,'or iniended to do, in tbe way of recruiting was right, he cooJol have bad no Teluctance to communicate it to me, for his instructions required him to make that disclosure. Acting; in due frankness, and with a proper regard for tbe dictates. of international comity, Mr. Crampton should, itwouM seem, have disclosed to me aU ihe measures intended to be . nursued within the United States by iho agents of his. Govemment, including himself, jn execution of the act o£ Parliament for raising the Foreign Legion. Nay, he wasexpressly commanded by his Government to praatise no concealment with the American Government on thesubiect. If he had obeyed these orders sU misunderstanding between the two Governments would have been prevented]" This was the assurance on which our Government consented. ihat they should be held aculpaied and Mr. Crwnnton impeached, and was it true ? He called on Her Majesty's. Government to show that ithad the slightest foundation in fact. On this point thewhole question turned. If our Govemment enjoined Mr. Crampton to nseno eoncealnient, then there was an end to the-charge against them; but if,on-. : the contrary, Mr. Crampton received no such injunction, Her Majesty's Ministers could not escape from th«irresponsibaity. _ In making this assertion, however, Lor<t Clarendon, while_ betraying an imaginative memory asto what he had enjoined, evinced a dhSinoi consciousness of wlrat he ought to have enjoined and of what Mr. Grampianought to have done. He (Mr. Moore) would prove that, so far from there having been no concealment on the part of theEnglish authorities in America,.their condsct was all concealment-all a disavowing and denying of everything- - and everybody that was found out-all an nidiag, abetting, and approving of everybody who remained eonee»l««l and of everything that worked well underground. He undertook, also, to showthatjfr. Crampton was not "enjoined AawTill, aor even enjoined at all, to avoid concealment; bet tliat ite was abetted, sustained, approved, and defended in a courso of conduct of which concealment waa the very key-atone nnd the only possible hope of success.

THE IAT C SnL-s YoVNG.-With a sincere regr t, in which a large circle of personal friends and all the friends of the drama will share, we have to announce the death of the well-known and andmired CharlesYoung, -which took place on Sunday [the 29th inst.l at his residence in Brighton. For a considerable period he had been confined to his chamber by a severe illness, which he bore wvith manly patience and Christian resignation. Retired many years since from the pursuit of his profession, he gave up the remnainder of his life to the enjoyments of an accomplished taste and to the graver studies of religion. Tne handsome competence vhich he had acquired by his professional successes allo eing of every rational gratification, he indulged in them wibth the spiit of a gentleman, frequented society, aud by the urbanity of his manners and the exrtent of his da raeful information acquired and ?-etained friendships wlherever he wa3s known=. In conlnexion with the stage, Charles Youtng was a remarkable person. Beginning life with advan 'saons prospects, and with the example of his brother, one of the most distinguished surgenos of his day, he mnight have pursued fortune in almost any way which is open to ability. But the stage was his fascination. In his early days the etage exercised a power which has now niearly disappeared from the national feelings; it was a subject of national pride -a brilliant pledgo of popularity-an arena of ambitious genaus. The mantle had fallen from the shoulders of arrick on the Kemble family, and the great actor was the guest at nobsle tables and honoured by loyalty. We hold that England is the great country of the drama. Allowing to the foreign stage of all the dexterity, variety, and brLliancy of themelodrama, no other nation than our ovn has ever supplied, in either authorship or acting, the intense feeling, ~the strong fidelity to nature, or the ardent imagoinlation essential to the true dramna. John Kemble and Trs. Siddons realized a3l those conceptions, and the theatre assumed its natural rank, not merely as a personal indulgenre but as a national honour, It was in this period that Charles Young entered on the stagve, aud it is a striking etidence of his talents that he was not eclipsed at once by the lustre of those two great artists. On the contrary, he immediately established a reputaticn of his own. A handsome person, a singularly expressive countenance, and a fine voice were only the advantageous exterior of a remarkably intelligent and sensitive understanding. By this capacity he was equally suited to represent the classic drama and the works of the modern stage. Inthe Brutus of Shakspeare be was the Roman, as he might have declaimed in the Capito1. InI Zanga he was the fiery and noble Moor as he might have ruled iIt the tents of the Desert, in the Stranger he was the model of manly grief. In Sir Pertinax Macsycophant he was the best representative that -we have ever seen of that muatchless mxture of shrewdness and Dexibility, of shyness and stermness, of selfishness aud ambition, which make it the cleverest caricature of national manners on the stage. ARl these trinmphs of the stlage are memones, unfortunately, of s past generation, visions -which this age cannot expect to summ.non-fine recollechtios, which we may as well raze out from among the ",written traces of our brain." By what fatality the stage has perished among us it is not our office to tell; -we must wait for its revival until some of shose chances return which refill the thirsty channels of cational genius-the rising of some new constellation in the Vacant hemisphere of the stage; the patronage of Royalty, followed by a new Shakspeare, bringing with him-n new race. It would be a kind of tzeason to doubt the fertility of the national genius. But, until the due season come, w.e must be content to bear the results of legislative folly, and feed olt the husks of Gerniany and tho 2cceiaZlffgs Of France as bht we imay. These sentiments have risen with the recollection of the accomplished person wvhose loss we deplore, and are our voluntary and natural tribute to the memory of tbe acor and the man.-Slandard.

LONDOXY, TUBSDAy,.Jul 1,18,. _ F1,1 3 In the House or lords Icas night thle Royal Assent was given by commision to several bill In reply to a question from I ord L--'DnRUsr, The Earl of CO&-Nox stated that it 'waa not yet in the power of the Governmente to h. before the House the correspondence which haad paaed with other Governmenta ol the Italian queston. No anser had yet been received fro laple5s to a note communicated to the KnG by the British and French Governments, but there was
The Quarterly returns of the Revenue indicate an increasing prosperity, even under the dark shadow of war, and afford the promise of a much greater improvement when that shadow shall have fairly passed away. In the Customs of the Quarter there is an increase of 96,4151. as compared with the corresponding Quarter of last year. This is ascribed to a considerable increase in the receipts upon sugar, while there has been a large decrease in those from tea. The Excise of the Quarter exhibits a much more decided improvement,-no less than 241,6261. This is owing to the abundant hop crop of last year and to an increased consiumption of spirits. In malt it would seem there has been a falling off; and by one of those accidents which are always causing fluctuations of no real significauce there have been unusuallylarge repayments on exports. In the Stamps of the Quarter there has been a slight decrease, which is still set down to the partial repeal of the duty upon newspapers. In fact, the attempt to cripple this journal by im'posing on it a higher duty by one-half than is paid by any other newspaper has reacted most injuriously on the revenue. Instead of paying a penny on each copy, as we would willingly have done, we now only stamp about a fifth of our circulation, and the revenue suffers to that amount. In the Asessed Taxes there is no variation to speak of. In then Quarter's Property-tax there is an increase of 116,9951., owing to the increased rate of duty. The other items present nothing remarkable. The Post-office has yielded 9,0001. less th1m the correspondina Quarter, which is probably onLy a matter of account. The result is that on the Quarter there is a net increase of 422,0521. A comparison of the -whole year just ended with the previous year vould only be a summary of remarks already made on the several quarters. It may, however, be as well to observe that on the whole year there is an increase -of 651,5611. on the Customs, chiefly owing to increased receipts upon sugar; an increase of 3,522,6631. on thc ProperLy-tax, 49,1521. on the Post-office, and 248,1601. in miscellaneous items, chiefly arising from the sale of old stores, which still figure in the revenue instead of being deducted from the expenditure. On the other hand, the year's Excise shows a decrease of 89,7947., and the year's Stamps a decrease of 297,712l., the net gain on the year being 4,101,6201. In the whole return, though on a war scale, there is only one tax which can be said to be seriously oppressive to any class of the people. In saying this we mean that vith regard to most of the taxes a little thrift, or rather more consideration, will easily make up for the increase of the tax consequent on the wvar. We have no great comrmiseration for the man who, by reducing his consumption of spirits a sixth or a tenth, can make matters Atraight, as far as that item is concerned, with the Cxmxon oF T.Em En- cHQux. But a double Income-tax presses heavily upon thousands who either have fixed incomes or increasing expenditure, and who must aet all their wits to work to meet the calls of the collector. We would not say one syllable to disparage the true patriotism, the patience, the self-denial, and the devotion unto death exhibited by the poorer classes in the country during the war, in common with all other classes. Nor can it be denied tnat by indirect processes the very poorest Yhava paid their proportion to the war, in the restriction of profitable employment and the prevailing spirit of retrenchment. Nevertheless, honour to those to whom honour is due; and it should not be omitted that the chief cost of the war has been, borne 'oy the more wealthy classes. They have had to suffer sacrifices of the most palpable and most trying character, in order toameet thalargeaumatakeuin the lump in property or income tax. Tho tax must run its course, and it i3 of very little use to complain of it ; but for the sake of truth its burden and its ill consequences should be stated while we still suffer and see them. Ono bearing of the proprty-tax, we should hope will not escape the notice of our metropolitan reformers. There are few things more taxed than that boasted fortress, the Englishman's house. After paying not only for the streets, for. gas, and all sorts of purposes of substantial utility, it pays heavily to the paupers, the lunatics, the offenders of the locality. After all that, and more, it pays a large inhabited house duty to the Exchequer. In addition to aU this, every tolerable dwelling-house is now paying more than 61. 10s. per 1001. to the property-tax. Now, what is the result? 'hen money is wanted for those great purposes of use or ornament in which our cities are so bakward the invariable answer is, that there is no money,-nobody willing to subscribe, nobody ready to be taxeed more than he is taxed already, and no Chancellor of the Exchequer likely to come forward to propose a new tax on houses for the improvement of our towns. All this is true enough, but it is singularly hard that our houses should be overtaxed for both local aud general purposes till they lie under a dozen layers of taxation, all the time that money is wanted for the improvement of our cities and towns, which are but aggregates of houses. These reflections are suggested by seeing that the increase of revenue in the year just ended, compared with the previous year, is almost entirely caused by the increased property-thx, at a time -when all public improvements are confessedly at a standstill, owing, it is said, to the war.
Lord CLAn:oENDo is unwilling for the present to produce the correspondence in which the Foreignoffice has been engaged with the petty Princes of Italy, especially with the King of NApLs. Lord LYNDHUPST last night, in the House of Lords, put a question to the FormiGN; SEcauTARY, which elioited from him this brief statement. The correspondence, it appears, is yet going on. There was a despatch communicated jointly by the English and French Governments to the Court of Naples, and the answder to that despatch is daily expected. With respect to the other Italian States, Lord CLRENDNo informed the Peers that the QusxN's Government had offered their advice to those Governments which now occupy with their troops the Papal territory. They are desirouls to withdraw their troops, and the Pops's advisers acquiesce in the withdrawal,-that is, as soon as a smaUl military force which they are now organiz7ig has arrived. The withdrawal of -the French troops, however, would but mean increased pressure from Austria. Viewed from this, which is the true point of view, it is scarcely to be desired that the French regiments should permanently evacuate the Papal States until the PoPE: has made those concessions to public opinion which wiU secure him, on the one hand, against the wildest excesses of anarchy, and his subjects, on the other, against the direst effects of military oppression. We are bound, upon Lord CLArNDooN's representation, to accept the fact that Austria has actually expressed a desire to withdraw her troops from the Pontifical States as soon1 as the circurmstances of the time allow of such a step. Such an expression of desire, however, on the part of that jesuitical Govermment is scarcely deserving of serious notice. It can be modified, suspended, or declared void at their pleasure. When would Austria, if left to follow the irmpulses of her own policy, find the " eircum" stances' which would enable her to withdraw her troops from any Italian province she had once occupied ? The greater portion, however, of Lord Lyn-. nUnSTrS question was pointed at the afflicting condition of Naples at the present moment. "cIy " LIords," said he, " it appears to me, as far as "I can collect, that the whole government of "Naples is in the hands of police agents, spies, "and informers; and I begin to despair of the state of things in that country." Such language as this with reference to a Government with which England is presumed to be on terms of friendly alliance has seldom been heard in the House of Lords from the lips of an English Peer. The urgent necessity of the case will be esteemed by his fellow-countrymen a strong and sfficient justification of the course which Lord LYNDnunSr has thought it right to pursue. It is a scandal and reproach to two such Powers as France and Great Britain that they are unable or unwilling to put down at once by the strong hand such abominations as those which daily and hourly defile the beautiful shores of the Neapolitan Bay. Simple men who have not been trained to appreciate the reticences of diplomacy, nor to be over-chary of the sympathies of despotic Governments, ask each other in the streets why half-a-dozen transports, freighted withFrench and English troops on theirreturn from the Crimea, and as many ships of war, do not let go their anchors for a few hours in front of the KucG's Palace, and set a little to rights all that is so infinitely wrong. We have heard enough of non-intervention, but surely there is a broad and unmistakeable distinction between that intervention which takes place from motives of selfsh policy and national aggrandizement and that intervention which is forced as a necessity of his nature upon every nman of decent feeling when within his hearing outraged humanity shrieks aloud for help. Who acts upon the doctrine of nonintervention when he sees a woman struck down by a ruffian, or a belated traveller in the hands of thieves W AVe are very confident that any English Minister who was so little of a statesman as to accept a single rood of Italian ground in the Rnglis name would speedily be driven with ignominy from power. The Emperor Louis NsAOLEoN, to the best of our belief, is actuated by the same policy as ourselves. He is too wise a man not to know that the system of satrapies presided over by the Princes of his House and by his Marhals brought about the ruin of his uncle. A compact France is a strong France. No dynasty will ever permanently reign over a weakened France. The SovFREIGN who at present holds the government of that great country in his hands, if we are not ,much mistaken, is wise enough to avoid the errors of his predecessors and to steer clear d the shoals upon which they were wrecked. lWhy, then, should not France and England, having no selfish ends to serve, declare and act upon a determination to relieve the people of Southern Italy from the sufferings so wantonly inflicted upon them by a petty mnonarch for whose conduct partial insanity seems to be the only excuse ? Things remain in Naples just as they have been now for many months past. No words of ours could exaggerate the scandal of the recent political i trials. That it may not be supposed we are singular in our views, we woulcd call partieular attention to Lord LyNDuuRsrs words of last night :_" The recent trials have disclosed proceecd" ings of a most scandalous nature, such as, for p "instanoa, ministers of religion stripped of their "religiouts dues and threatened with imprison"ment and with the infliction of lashes, unless F "they consented to give evidence against the "amused." Lord LT-ZnUsRT Might and should have said " false evidence," for that was, the point. One of the Augustine monks, after having deposed against WuGoceo, went to the general of his order, threw himself at his feet, and confessed ";that all he ad ad was fablo "he had been menaced, and feared exile or th3 "Ergastolo." Another monk deposed in open court that CAMPAGNA stripped him, and threatened to lash and imprison him, unless he would depose against ILuGG1}ito. The agents of this execrable nian abused and spat upon* others of the Augcutine monks, threatened them with imprisoDment, and, as was stated in court, conducted themselves "like wild beasts." if this were a solitary case, an isolated aet of tyranny-foul and disgusting as it might be,-wa should not thinLourselves justified in redommending interference; but the scene of horrors disclosed in the course of this investigation is, we fear, but an average specimen of " life in Naples" at the present day. France and England have the powver to remedy this outrageous evil almoBt by an expression of their WilL. If they refuse to dc so, how can they stand excused ?
There was a time when the juxtaposition of the two words "Ireland" and "Pauperism" caused the most disagreeable sensations. A picture rost imnmediately before the mind, grin with the srllen hues of the most squalid misery and the most wild discontent. Tribes of roving mendicants, cabins of half-famished villages, workhnoises turned into hospitals and hospitals into lazarhouses-such was the picture that the mention of these two names conjured up. Partly, yet not grossly. overcharged, it represented niany of the horrors that shocked. English visitors and politicians during two sad and eventful years. It is one of the happieaz ovents of otUr age that we can now speak of this description as belonging, to the past. Nay, so different is the present state of things that the former seems rather to belong to a very antiquated past than to recent history. We owe it, however, to that habit of statistical comment which constitutes the staple literature of modern politics that we are able to trace and analyze a change as sudden as it is grateful, as unexpected as it is wonderful. The annual reports of the Irish Law Commis- sioners enable us to anatomize the social condition d of the sister island in its phases of mutation. Our readers wiU have been prepared for the general tenour of their last report by the summary we gave of the Emigration Report for the last year. The Poor Law and Emigration Returns are the twvo sides of the same historical medal which commemorates the progress of the people. They change concurrently with the vicissitudes of national prosperity. As the pressure of population upon subsistence increases, so does the pressure of competition for emigrant-ships and workhouse relief.- As the supply of food and employment increases, so do the demands on the emigration agents and the relieving officers diminish. From the report- under notice it appears that the total number of persons receiving relief in the year ending September, 1855, vas about 304,000. Of these 270,000 received indoor, and the remainder outdoor relief. Those who recollect the time when, not in Ireland, but in England, the pauper population bore-to the whole population of the country the proportion of one to ten will appreciate the fact which these figures indicate. Although the accounts of the different Unions are not made up later than last September, it is gratifying to knuow that the conclusion deducible from them is more than justified by the reporEs which the assistant-inspectors give of the state of the labour-market in most of the counties of Ireland. From these it appears that since the beginning of the present year wages have averaged; mnore, and the cost of provisions less, than during| previous years; that continuous employment is, in the greater number of coiunties, nob difficult of attainment, and that the Unions have almost ceased to contribute towards aiding pauper emigration. All these circumstances will naturally diminish the Poor Law expenses of the year endingo September, 1856, below those of the year which I terminated last September, and it is satisfactory to observe the decrease -which took place in that year as compared with the preceding one. WVhile the whole Poor Lavr expenditure of the year ending September, 1854, exceeded M60,0001., that of the subsequent year only slightly exceeded 685,0001., showing a reduction of nearly 75,0001., or about 10 per cent. Buit there is another noticeable feature in these figures. While the expenses of the Poor Law have reached 685,0001., the sums collected upon the prevailing assessment of property (including, probably, some arrears of rates) amounted to 835,0001., showing an excess of 150,000!., and, after making deductions for collateral payments, leaving a real surplus of 4$,0001. receipts over expenditure. This fact carries its own comfort to those who either have invested or meditate investing in Irish property. We have already mentioned the relative proportions between the present pauperism of Ireland and the recent pauperism of England. Alin to this is the relation between the rate of contributions raised per head on the population of England and that raised on the population of Ireland. While, as it appears from the Report of the Commissioners in England and Wales, each person pays at the rate of 5s. Od. towards the relief of the poor, and in Scotland at the rate of 4s., in Ireland the whole expenditure is about 2s. per head, and this, be it remnembered, in a country which ten years ago was pronounced by travellers of experience and observation to be the very poorest in Europe, and wvhich it was eight years ago prophesied woluld be utterly ruined by embracing the E34nglish system of Poor Laws ! We have in a few years seen so many changes that it would be almost a mark; of insanity to augur the stability of anly one phase of conditions. We cannot therefore smdertal-e to predict that the lIisuh Labourer shall at all times of aU years earn his Is. 2d. per day; that the Irish mechanic shall continue to earn from 16s. to 20s. per week; that there shall always be plenty of work and an abundant crop of potatoes; and that poor-rates shall not exceed 2s. per head, or Is. 2d. in the pound. But we may safely say this :-Things are now so favourable in Ireland that it will require more than usual blundering on the part of all classes to plunge the island back into the same quagmraire from which it has only emerged within the last two or tlhree years. It will only be necessary that Irish proprietors should anticipate their rents, mortgage their properties, renew the old vicious system of infinite division of laud and multiplication of tenements, and that corn crops and cattle should universally be displaced for potatoes, to begin a series of disasters such as found their consummation in the horrors of the famine year. Add to these the pleasing ingredients of agrarian out:rage, faction fights, Riba-ndism, and sacerdotal agitation, seasoned with a few violent ejectments, and then the history of the past will have been recorded in vain, and the sufferings of the past will have oozed through the minds of a nation, leaving no more trace tban the rare and occasional rains of Egypt leave on the sands- of the Desert. It is for Irishmen-proprietors, tenants, clergy of all creeds, merchants, and tradesmen-to protide against so terrible a relapse. They have one cDmmon interest. However different and differing I in other respects, they are linked by the tie of one denomination. IanUdlords, tenants, Itomanists, Proteatants-they are all ratepayers. Every villago, every district, every Union, every count-y, has the 1 sturet gauge and the nost sensitive iseat i the fortunes of tha- country. That gauge is tbr relief gauge-that test is tho rate test. It will henceforth le impossiblo for the miserable and destitut6 to congregate in murtitudes without a premonition that can only become terrible by being disregarded. The frst symptoms of a recurrence of a malady like that of 1846-47 wrill be made too obvious and too sensible to permit its full development. All will be on the alert to prevent a calamity which, iL unarrested, must strike all, and which all have, -mder the law, the power of mitigaing, if not of averting. They have almost cut out that which was supposed to be the ineradicable sore of the -Irish social state-mendicancy. They have succeeded in relieving helpless poverty without encouraging insolent and audacious idleness. It is for them-the ratepayers of Ireland-to provide against the renewal of a crisis which, as before, vill defy ordinary remedies and exhauni ordinary resources.

HER fAJESTY'S THEATRE. Last night ilademoiselle Piccolomini performed the part of Maria, in I-a Figlia del Beggirmento, for the 'hird time, and we may fairly deem ourselves sufficiently acquainted with the peculiarities of her interpretation to determine her position. On an auditor who sat with closed eyes, determined to hear the performance of a mere cantatricc, the effect of her Maia might not be remarkable, for even in the snging lesson she does not embrace those opportunities for vocal display wihich have been caught with avdlity by her predecessors. But to the spectstor who sits w"ith his eyes wde open as well as his esrs, and talkes in the general combination of figure, countenance, gesticulation, and singing, the effect is absolutely charming. Rarely -indeed do we see a part more adequately acted, ana we use the word not as a commonplace, but as the most accurate expression to de,note how thoroughly, casting aside aU the rest of her nature, Mademoiselle Piccolomini becomes the little zi*eandicre she undertalkes to represent. The playful air, the saucy look of unconventional independence, the light trotting march; like that of a child playing at soldiers, are the very perfection of naoiret. She is a living picture that could not be altered without detriment. Then how pretty is the manner in which she sings and looks (we are not committing a solecism) the air " Ciascun lo. dice," which in the Lind-days was ringing through every street in the metropolis. You feel that she is proud of her identity -with the famous " Undecimo Reggimento,"and when she rognishly looks round at the soldiers as she utters the second half of the line, " Che un sesso teme, che laltro adore," the coquety of the woman is added to the esprit d co;ps of the devoted comrade. Where she Parts with her old friends she grieves like a petted child; she frets because the holydays are over and dreary schooltime is to recommence. When under the rule of her aunt, she sing; the song about Venus and Philomel, and such like drawingroom paganiams, till she can bear the heathen infliction no longer, and breaks out into the darling old "Rataplan," flinging the scroll of music to the ground, and commending it to powers below that level, she is the same petted child after the arrival at school has tsken place, andthe desire of a rebellionbegins. A higher position is taken when the soldiers once more crowd around her, aud she sings, " Eviva la Patria !" By a slight alteration of the test the substitutes "I'Italia" for "Ia Patria," and as sho extends her arms in the inspiration of the moment, and Lher eyes flash with new-born zeal, her minute form expands into a sort of patriotic allegory. Nor would our description be complete if we passed over the manner in which last night she acknowledged the reception of the botquets flung at the end of the opera by the mnore ardent of her admirers. It was aU of a piece with the child-like character of the impersonation. She picked up the flowers wvith evident gusto, heaped them in her arms' as a delighted urchin would accumulate a colection of birthday gifs, and, when celled before the curtain for the second time, most hilariously reappeared, still clutching fast the fr%grant treasures. A "newseosationl is avery old phrase, but that is exactly what is giren by Mademoiselle Piccolomini. The Sergeant Sulpiziois well sung by x Belletti, and MI. Calzolari especially distinguishes himself as the lovesick Tonio. Iudeed, his air, towards the end of the first act, considered as a inere piece of vocalization, is, perhaps, the best executed mnorceau of theentire opera. The "frumpish" Maichioness is played with much humour by Mademoiselle Borgaro, whose formal thumping of the piano heightens the effect produced by the contumacy of Maria.

.rIEN%1Y LrTNfS iASr C02YoRBr. Jenny Lind took her leave of the English public I1* might, in xeter-hall, where A veritable multitude ha assewmbled to greet her. The excitement of tbi oc#ioa can only le compared in intensity and unanimity to that which was created on the might of her d4$ at Her Majesty's Thestre-May 4, 1847.. There was this difference, however-that instead of the .carioeity engendered by an extraordinary reputation, and the peou. liar feeling &lat n-turally aitates the mindc of axn audience about to listen to something. gmat for thet Irst time, it was regret at parting from an object long and deservedly cherished, tempered by a corsciousness of gratilication to be derived from the performance and of satisfaction in the privilege of assisting at such A ceremony. Inshort, the universal sentiment last mightl was one of pleasure mixed with pain-for, if ever public perforuiermaybe said to have reigned in the heart of a nation, Jenny Lind lias reigned in the heart of England, throughout the lenigth sand breadth of which her name is familiar as a household wvord. The causes of this unprecedented popularity nee4 not here he dwelt upon; enough that, although Jenny Lind is one c f the greatest of Artists, it is not to her art Alone that she is indebted for her celebrity; and, on the other hand `hile there is every reason to believe her one of the most single-minded and benevolent of her sex, it is not raerey her personal character that has raisea her to the place slhe enjoys in the world's esteem. Others hayd pobably sung as well-perhaps (we doubt it) letter, but nox one, at least in our time, has sUng like her; others mayhave been as kind and charitable, hut none have publiely exercised the qualities of charity andkindness in a precisely. similar manner. Jenny Lind, is, in fact, a,,, oIgi ae4 in the fullest acceptation of t-he tern. The grace which is -hers belongs to ,herself exclus,vely. Evoes her voice, beyond the fact of its being a soprno, pos-. sesses nothing in common with any other voice we have heard; and though she has lived in a century remarkable for great singers, ss has maintained a place apart froutthem all. No'. to become rhapsodical, however, the "Farewell Concert" of Jenny Lindlast night is likely to be remembered for a loug time to come by the audience and herself,since the demonstration that accompanied it was worthy of both, and flattering toboth. Asitwasnndonbtedly the last concert, and as everything connected with the event must possess a certain kind of interest, we subjoin the pro. granmme- Overture-" Clemsena di TiW' .. .. Mozart. Hy,mn for Soprano, Chorus, and Organ- Madame Goldschmiat .e . n. .. Med elssoha. Concerto DrammatioioDin. Esrr Enst Spohr. Sacred Cantata-the 130tho% saoto5 ladame Goldsebmid; and Mr. Lockey..

From the above it will be seen that r7e should besepared the duty of criticism, even if it were possible, under the circumstances, to be critical. Every piece ia the programmer (including the psalm and concerto of Herr Otto Goldschmidt) had been already heard this season. We slil therefore confine ourselves to recording that the regret at parting with such a singer was mado all the moro po3gnant by the splendour of her performances, which left the fixed impressico. that Jenny lind rwas about toretire into private life in the very meridian of herpowvers. When she first came on to sing in Mendelssohn's hymn she was welcomed by a shout of applause from all paits of the hall, the orchestra included. As the concert progressed the enthusiasm of the audience got warmer and warmoer, until, after the ertrcmely arduous and trying song of ,he Qaeen of Night (from Dic Zaluflrflte), -which taxes the highest notes of the voice so ferribly, it became exacting and Jerny Lind was compelled to repeat the Alegroone performance alone of which is enough to shako the physical force of the strongest and most expert vocalLst The second time, however, was even better than the first. The great finale from Lae &nna7nbuzf presented threefold difficulties after such an effort; but these were overcome with ease, and the cantabile singing in the recitative and lanpo, "IIhnon credea," was unsurpassable for pathos, delicacy, and refinement, disclosing all the old beauties so often described-and especially that incompar- 6ble sotto voce shake at the conclusion-ia colours more thaa ever attractive. This truly exquisite performancelistened to throughout by the whole of the vast audience in breathless silence-was followed by such a burst of applause as seldom meets the gratified ears of al artist. The andience were enraptured, and the singer was enraptured too-at least, if we may draw conclusions from the gush of song which followed in the rondo, "Ah non giunge"-only to be liLened in its beatay and impulsiveness to those "profuse strains of Un-premeditated art" which the poet attributes to the skylark. The audience responded by cheer after cheer, and Jenny Lind was compelled to return to the orchestra; but, having yet another task to perform, she wisely declined to repeat the rondo. The last piece was the well-known "Echo Song," in which, as usual, tLe songsiress accompanied herseLf at tho piano. There was something suggestive in this Swedish melody, which, aer the reiterated " echos," as every'oDdy knows, terminates pianissimo-like the music of some sweet voice heard from a long distance. Jenny Lind seemed to bestow more than ordinary pains upon this illusion, and lingered upoa the few concluding notes, as if with a feeling thaI they were the very last to which she vwas es-er to give utterance in presence of the English public. If such were really the case nothing could be more natural, since where so large a sympathy has been shown it is impossible to believe that it has notin some measure been reciprocated. JennyLind has given us good cause to think that she does 3ot belong to the common race of artists, and th&t. ingratitude does not belong to her nature. Let us, then, believe that the regret felt at narting waS note all on one side, and that the Slight tremulousness 'which imparted an additional charm to those soft and just audible tones at the end of the "E cho Song"' came from the heart of the singer anld meant something more than a simple expedient resorted to for the purpose of effect. Of one thing we are certain-the last notes of Jenny Lind will not very soon be forgotten by those who were fortunate enough to hear them. They represented the final greeting of onewho has rather been idolizedthan courted as an ordinary public favourite, and were listened to With an interest little short of painful. To pourtray the scene that ensued is not easy. The audience rose as one, applauding, cheering, and waving hats and handkerchiefs, with an enthusasui that defies description. The object of 'ris extraordinary oration-in which the ladies were quite as earnest as the gentlemen-was at length so moved by it that she caught the infection from her admirers, and waved her own handkerchief, first to the audience, and then to the orchestra, with a heartiness that left little doubt cf her emotion. When she had gone she was caled baci s9aIn, and the scene repeated. Tha end was thus worthy of the beginning. Jenny ljind& won lhe favour of the English public from the first, and retained itundiminishedto tnelast, which recent events have proved; and, as we take it for granted that fcw can be in. differentto what immediately concers the weliAre of one who-not merely by rare gifts, but by good worls-has attained such distinction. we are glad of this opportunity to assre our readers that Madme Jenny hind Goldschmidt retires from public life to devote herself to a home which is now, and.has been since she was first married, one of undloudei happnos Wef. W be tctused from entering into furt'her details about the concert of last night - but a word of acknowledgment is due to Elerr Ernst for ins very fine performance of Spohr's Dramatic Conoerto. And now that the Jenny Lind -performances are over, we may also compliment Mlr. Mitchell, wrho has manased them throughout with a discretion and politeness that have given universal satisfaction.

FOREl,IGN INTELMGFYCE. FRANCE. (FBM OT OWN cO0PO-sDM) , A portion of the foUc'vWih4 appead in our second edi. E cf y etedy :-1 : PARIS, SUNDAY, JuNE 29, 6 Psr. The Emperor leavel Paris on Tuesday for Ploinbi&ees, where he purposes remaining about thiee weeks. As the opinion generally prevails that a Sovereign cannot stir from his capital, or indeed a31e3 step in any direction, without one politieel object ins view, -arioua rumours have circulated, -but hich, as I am assured, contain hardly a particle of truth. For instance, there is none whatever in what has been said relative to the interview withitheEmperorof Aiustria onthe shores of theLakce of Constance, and the projected visit to the Castle of Arenemberg, on the Rhine, I am also disposed to reg,ard as apocryphal, though I would not affirm that such a tbing may not -happen. Al that canbe said is, that at this moment 1 believe the Emperor las no such intention. The truth of the matter is that the Emperor, who has worked very hard for some mouths past, feels the necessity of a short but absolute respite from, his labours. He has aLo suffered from occasional attacds of gout, and a change of air and of scene is very necessary for ~aim. The sojourn he intends, therefore, making at Plombifres is to enjoy that complete repose which it is in vain fot Mia to expect either at the Tuileries or St. Cloud. He will attend to no pubLe busine3s while at that watermig-place, His Majesty being determir.ed to allow notbing to disturb his repose during these three wveeks. This will be understood also both by those who may have, and those who have no petitions to present. The Empress will not accompany her husband; she remains at St. Cloud, and not until His Majesty's return will her journey to Biarritz be definitively settled. I mentioned on a former occasion, that there was a difference of opinion among th- medical men as to whether the sea air was not too sharp for the Lmnperial infant, and the Empress is naturally un'willing to separate herself from her child. Count Waleu-ski, who stands no less in need of repcse after the harassing occupations of so many months, in addition to the ordinary and onerous duties of his otBce, leaves on Thursday next for Homburg, the waters of which are prescribed' for him . In this case also, whatever may have been said to the contrary, health alone, and not politics, is the cause of the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affaim. He purposes returning to Paris towards the end of next moanth. 'When speaking of the departure of important personages, that of the Cardinal Legate cannot be omitted. His Eminence, having nearly completed his farewell visits,, Ieaves on Wednesday next, en -'otate for Rome. The rumour that negotiations had been going on with him with reference to the coronation of the Emperor by the Pope is, I am assured, unfounded. This does not mean that His Holiness will never come to Paris to perform that ceremony (about which, I believe, no one can say nnything certain),-it merely means that to Cardinal Patrisi nothing has been said on the subject. The Cardinal is a very worthy man, according to general testimony, and a holy man, but his friends say that he doea not exactly realize the popular idea about the intellectual powers of the members of the Sacred College. He is no politician, and has had no political mission of any kind. If negotiations have been, or are to be opened for such a purpose, the French Government cannothave a better person than 1-1. de Rayneval, the Minister of France at Rome, who, by the by, I regret to say, is coming to Paris on sick leave. lie has been for months seriously ill, and at one moment during the last winter his case appeared hopeless. C.-rdinal Patrizi returns to onome wel satisfied with his reception at this Court. Be has received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour from the Emparor, and, as a peculiar distinction, has received it in diamonds! Other people who have entitled themselves to so high a recompense only get it in silver and enamel. Who would :ot be a Cardinal? "Vanitas vanitatum !" the Cardinal is said to have uttered when the box containing the valuable gift was handed to him; but it will be ccnsoling to mere worldlings to learn that his Eminence's self-denial did not amount to a rejection of the honour. The Cardinal is not the only person 'who receives gifts at the hand of the Emperor. The Pope is informed that the Emperor sends him, as a yree,ent, a superb baptistry, of the most beautiful ;Sevrea porcelain, accompanied by an autograph expres-ion of His Majesty's filial affection for HisHoliness, and his gratitude for the honosir lately rendered to him. Every one knovs the French saying -' Les petits cademaix entretiennelit a'miaih" The French Government are very proud, and very naturally so, of the remarkable expedition with' w hich the evacuation of the Crimea is conducted. The rapidity with wlhich the operation is taldng place far o-tstrips anything that had been anticipated in the War Department. I am assured that by the 10thof Jt:ly every F'rench soldier wilhave left the Criea arnd at that date will have ended an operation wvhich kegan not before the 30th of April. It is considered here as a proof of the great progress made in naval matters by the French within tbe last three years, not to speak of the excellence of theirAdministration. I can assure you that our allies are very proud of it. I have said that by the 10th of July the last man will have left the Crimea; I am also assured that by the 15th of August the same will take place with refference to every part of Turkey, and that not a French soldier will be found in any part of the Ottoman empire. It appears that it is also decided to evacuate Greece, though I have heaxd no date fixed. The Russian and French Ambassadors, and the Minister for Foreign Aflfairs of Great Britain, will confer in London on the policy that it will be necessary to I follow with respect to the -very troublesome country which has the good fortune tobe ruled by the Bavarin Solomon, liing Otho. What is intended to be dane with His Greek Majesty, or what measures will be taken to remove the evils which affect that people, I am not able to say; perhaps no one else is. mThe commission for fixing the new boundary to Moldavia, or, which is all the same, for fixing on the portion of territory which is to be lopped off from Bessarabia for the benefit of that Principality, is rapidly approachingtheterminationof its labours. Several of the points on which the line of limitation i- to run have already been agreed to by the corasnissioners, who, I believe, are now at Bucharest. The commissioners for the organization of the government of the Principalities cannot commence their work till the Austrians complete their evacuation, and that evacuation wMl not be completed till the new boundary in Bessarabia is settled and the detached territory transferred to Turkey. The commnissioners will thus be enabled to carry on their deliberatiens withsut the fear of Austrian bayonets before their eyes. It is not yet klown who will be the new RusEamn Ambassador at Paris. It is certain that the 4" coraing man"' is not Prince Dolgoroulc, nor probably Count Strogonoff. Prince Dolgorouki, independent of other considerations, was more than half afraict to undertake diplomatic fimetiens vithout, I believe, having served a regular apprenticeship to the trade. Opinions inclins in favour of General Co-mt Kisseleff, who, I believe, is brother to the late Ambassador of the same name. Ihe " protest " of the Princes of Orleans was received in Paris yesterday. It was drawn up on very thin paper, and is addressed to the members of the legislative Corps. It is dated from Claremont, and bears the 'signatures of the Duke de Nemours, the Prince de Joinville, and the Duke d'Aumale. That of tha Duke de Montpensier does not appear. The Princes take the occasion of the project of law for AXJo,0of. to be inseribed in the great book - of the State in favou of the three Princesses of their family to state that they would confine themselves to declaring their rejection, so farasthey themselves nre concerned, of an illusory reparation, and of a chaatr exclusively pecuniary, but they find in the - reamble to that lawr 3 word against wahich they loadly protest, and that word is binsveWlatse: "Claremont, June 25.

During the last few weeks many persons have gone fiom Vienna to Constantinople, and from Constantinople to Vienna, by way of the Danube, and some of them have favoured me with information of importance relative to the actual state of things at the Sulina mouth of the river. In article 16 of the treaty of March 30 it is said that the seven Powers (Great Britain, Fiance, Turkey, Austria, Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia) will each furnish a representative to a Commission, whose duty it will be to see that the embouchures of the river, from Isalitcha downwards, are clear of sand and other impedimenta to their navigation. In the preceding article (15) mention is made ul police regulations, but it is not stated what power or powers is or are to undertake the task of ejecting front the village of Sulina the gang of bandits which now occupies it. The Austrian Government many months ago stationed a vessel of war at the Sulina, and her commander at once took the. law into his own hands, but, notwithstanding, his severity, neither the lives nor the property of the traders to Galatz are secure. -Those vagabonds who had particular reasons for wishing to get out of the reach of the French police at Constantinople removed to the Sulina, where they manage to live avt tlhe expense of the proprietors of the vessels which go up to and retun from Galatz and Braiow. There are now about 10J Eng-: lish feet of water on the bar, but not long since the t Helen, an English screw steamer, was obliged to lie three days in the offiling because the pilots did not think fit to bring her into tne river. The general belief is that the pilots play into the hands of the ligltermen, whosebusiness will naturally be at an end as soon as the European Commission has done its duty to the commercial public. As persons, who object to a long sea voyage now go to Constantinople by the Danube, I have taken some trouble to obtain imnpartial information as to the accommodation afforded by the vessels of the Danubian Steam Navigation Company. The tariff for passengers is exorbitant, but thle three fast steamers which run between Pesth and Galatz are remarkably elegant and clean, and the service and food excellent. The boats between Linz and Pesth are not bad, but the fares are ridiculously high, and the food and service below criticism. Travellers leaving Pesth at 9 o'clock on Monday morning by fast steamer reach Galatz on Thursday morning, and those who quiit Galatz at 10 on Satxurday arrive at Pesth on Thursday evening. The three fast steamers, Francis Jozeph, Archduke Albrec'nt, and Count Szechenyi, which run bet,ween Pesth and Galatzj are built on the American system, 'with saloon decks. A small and very long steamer, drawing only 14 inches of water, which was constructed in America for the ex-pres Ipurpoe, takes passengers through the so-called [Iron Gate. The luggage is conveyed through tho Iron Gate in l.arge barges, whlich are taken in tow by the steamer last mentioned. 'From the foregoing you may be inclined to isippose that a river 7opayga from Posth to Constantinople is from beginning to end agreeable, but you will soon learn that such is not exactly the case. The real misery of the voyage begins at Galatz, where the Unfortunate passengers are frequently detained thlree or four days in a wretched inn, which is literally alive with vermin, untilthe Austrian uLloyd steamer, which is to take them to Constantinople, arrives. The Danubian Steam Navigation Company has between 80 and 90 steamers, G or 70 steamtugs, above 400 enormous barges, and firtrate whlarfs, &c., but, notwithstanding all these advantages, it is in some danger of being beaten on the Lower Danube by more enterprising F'rench and English companies. If the Austrian-Danubian Company had prear energy, it would immediately lay on some of its own boats between Galatz and. Tk.nttantinople, and by so doing make itselG totally indepenennt of the Austrian Lloyd. By letters of the 13th from Galat we learn that the French, English, l and Turks have aready entered the lists agaifst the Austrians. The French steamer L,yonnais runs between Odessa and Galatz, and the Helen and a Turkish steamer betwteen Constantinople and Galath. The French have nortiedy sentrtheir agentsas far up the O)anube as Belgrade, but the English are less active. It ismy conviction thatCno cmpany could succelsfuzlly compete with the Austrian if the latter managedi matters i a busiess-like ways but the latter is so much under the superintendence of the S'ate that it cannot be considered a free agent. The Danubian Steam Navigation Company has lost its exclusive privilege, 'without, however, having gained an equivalent. In case of war the vessels of the company must always he at-the service of the State, and even if an indemnification is paid it -will be as small as possible. The* British press troubles itself comparatively little about the Danubian Principalities, but the columns of the French and German papers teem with articles on a subject the importance of which seems better understood on the continent than on the other side of the Channel. The assurance has to-clay been given me that the British Government is at present somewhat inclined to share the opinion of Austria, that Moldavia and Wallachia, as one Principality, would be more at the mercy of Russia than they are in their present state; but alL Austrian politicians are over-sanguine, and easily persuade themselves that what they wish is about to happen. Austria professes to fear that a DoldoWTallachian Principality would be as much in the hands of Russia as is the kingdom of Greece, and the apprehension does not appear unfounded; but the real reason why this Government is so averse to the union of the two provinces is, that it does not wish to see " anotner Sardinia formed between the Danube, the Pruth, and the CarPathians." About a week since you learned from me that-the parish priest of Penzing, a vilage at no great distance from Vienna, had sent back the corpse of a child to its parents, who are members of the nonunited Greek (Russian) Church. When the story was related it was remarked that it would probably prove to be correct, and information to-day received enables me to state that such is actually the case. The body of the child was carried to the grave by the sexton in the afternoon of the second day after its death, and wras brought back by the samne funetionary in the morning of the following day. The message sent by the bigoted priest to the astonished and afflict-ed parents was, that the remains of their child could not be interred in. the Catholic cemetery. As everything has been done to keep the matter from the knowvledge of the public, it is possible that the correctness of the foregoing statement may be called in question, but you may be sure that you have not been misinformed. WVhen the commissary of police interfered, the excuse made by the priest was that lie had declined to permit the corpse to be buied " because it had not received the benediction of the Greek priest." About six or eight months ago the police autho- rities of *this capital published some judicious ordinancos for the better observance of Sundays and holydays. The stalls of -the market people were to be cleared away and the shops of the grocers; butchers, chandlers, &c., closed at 9 o'clock, that is, before Divine service commenced. When the afternoon service is at an end all dealers in provisions, excepting butchers, are at liberty to reopen, their establishments. WVhea the bishops were assembled they came to the conOlusion that the observance of Sundays and holydays wvas a matter which concerned them more than the civil authorities, and spoke of issuing certain edicts that would have greatly interfered with the hebdomadal excursions which the Vienna citizens have from time immemorial been accustomed to makle with their wives and families. It was proposed that restrictions should be laid on the proprietors of the public gardens in the neighbourhood of the capital. No "dance music "(fxruiz-musikv) was to be allowed, and the little boys and g,irls were to be made goaod by remaining in the city and learning their catechism, instead of gathering strawblerries and flowers in the woods and fields. As the plan of the bishops -was communicated to the Emperor, it is to be presumed that it found favour in the sight of the MLinisters of the Interior and Public Educatior and Ecclesiastical Affairs. It has repeatedly been remarked in my correspondence, that the greatest secrecy is observed in all matters connected with the Church, but you will hardly be misled if you believe that His MIajesty has very recently sent autograph letters (hand bildets) to his above-mentioned official advisers, in which he declares it to be his will that things should remain as they now are, inasmuch as the cause of morality is not likely to be furthered by the suppression of innocent amusement. As the question of harmless and rational amusement on Sundays has so recently been before the British public, it will not be out of place to relate what has just occuired in Bavaria. In 1850 or 1851 the Bavarian Government issued ordinances for the stricter observance of Sindays and holydays. Recently, howvever, it has been repeatedly repiesentedto the Lower Cbamber that nogood service has been rendered to the cause of morality by the new regulations. Not long since the House delivered all the rpresentations *vhich had been received from the provinces into the hands of one of its members, wfith instructions to examine carefully into the merits of the same, and then to send in his report. The referendary well discharged the duty imposed on him, for his report was so lucid and convincing that the. House strongly recommended the Cabinet to return to the old system, the essence of vwhicli was, that as much larmless amusement as possible was provided for' the working classes. L; the Germans can hear music, and at the same time enjoy the fresh air of the country, they. care compara- tively little for strong drinks; but, if- deprived of i them, they will sit for hours together over their wine or beer. Provide but rational amusement for the lower classes in England, and they Will soon: lose that unenviable reputation which they at present enjoy in foreign countries. itsui is a fiend who has transformed millions of industrious and 1 sober worlknen into idle and incorrigible sots. The King of Greece has amrved here. It is stated that His 'Greek Majesty intends to visit' Paris, if he should have reason to suppose his visit would be acceptable.

Count Orloft has arrived here, on his way to St. Petersburg, after having very recently waited upon the Empress Mother, at Wildbad, on the way. The day before yesterday he was invited to dine -with the King at Sans Souei. The Crown Prince and Princess of Saxony, who are now on a visit to this Court at Sans Souci, formed part of the circle on that occasion. The statement contained in a recent letter of mine that the United States have agreed to let their ships continue paying the Sound dues for another year, although under protest, is quite correct; also that Austria joins with Prussia in remonstrating with Denmark on account of the latter's illegal alienation. of State domains in Lauenburg. Tho Prussian note is dated'June 1; the meinorial which accompanies it was written in May. Professor flinck, the Court architect, has just left here for London, to submit to Prince Friedrich Wilkelinthe plnsfora re-arrangenment of the interior of the so-called " Old Kings Palace," the destined future residence of the young Prince and his English consort. Up to the present time ihe rooms and their furniture have been left exactly as they were at the time of -the death of Friedrich Wilhelm ITL On the tables there are still to be found his books, newspapers, spectacles, and writing implements, as well as the many mementos he cherished of his deceased Queen Louisa, the most prominent of which to the stranger's eye is her tambour fiame, with a lhalf finished piece of embroidery in it. One of the first changes produced by t.he betrothal of the young Prince with the Princess Victoria, and strikingly emblematical of the future changes that will take place here -when the -well-known sympathies of the young Prince and his father have free opening to exhibit themselves, is that Count Dohna, the :High Chatnberlain of the Court, has to turn out of a suite of rooms, that he had been perraitted by the good-nature of the. King to inhabit, on the ground floor. Count Dohna is a member of the so-called Camarilla to which so much evil influence is attributed in Prussia, and his forced withdrawal from the habitation he has hitherto occupied in the " Old King's Palace," to the great scandal of all who cherish the memory of the late King and the war of liberation with special reverence, is but a foretokern of the general turn-out that will sooner or later take place with the many small-minded persons in the immediate vicinity of the King, who aU do their " ptit.possible" to prevent Prussia's progressing in the path that historical tradition and political necessity have assigned her. The Dolma faTmily is recognized by all persons versed in the history of ~Prussia as possessing a very great degree of loyalty and patriotism, and, on the other hand, as being privileged to possess a smaller amount of enlightened intelligence than their compeers. One of the chief complaints that is made against the present Count is that he avails himself of this latter privilege to an unjustifiable extent. Either there has been no invitation sent from here to the Emperor- of Austria, which is all along considered to be highly improbable, or there is no probability of his availing himself of it. I am assured now that there has-not been any given. On the other hand, the 'probabilities seem to increase of the Emperor Franz Joseph having a meeting with the E3irperor Louis Napoleon very shortly in Switzerland. * The Russian General Ruidiger died at Karlsbad on the 22d'inst. of dropsy, without having, had time to take a bath or. drink any of the. waters; his body has been embalmed, and is to be sent to Russia. MIr. Sidney Herbert was present at the religious -cereniony -in the Evangelical church. On the same day as the Prussian flotilla arrived off Risinore (the 20th inst.) with Prince Adalbert on board the Danzig, the Cressy screw ship-of-the-line arTived there, and it being the anniversary of Queen Vrictoria's ascension of the throne, hoisted the Royal flag at 1' 'clock and fir-ed a Royal salute. This wvas retur-ned by the whole Prussian flotilla and by the Danish guardabip and fortress of Kronenbur-g. At about' the samue time the Prince and Princess Friedrich of Hemsen (tlhe lat`et a Pi-ussian Princess by birth) arrived in a Danish steamer from Copenhagen and visited each of the Prussian vessels. The conastant reciprocal- - salu'ies of the three flags, the iRoyal asension,' and tbe distinguished visitors, produced such a cannonade as has not been heard in Copenhagen since the n-starred days of 1801 and 180S. Even on this peaceful and festive occasion Demnarkdid not escape without injury, for the windowv panes in Elsinore have suffered extremely. SARDINIA. - ' (FroR oa olw cORunSsOZnrnrr) TURI, Jrnz 25.

I '. STHE UNITED STATES. I (mFROm OITR OnV%- (NmRvwm 41T - I e-t 2NIiW YOlKR, Jcsx 17. The next step in the Presidential election is to be taken at Philadelphia this week-possibly to-daynamely, the selection of a candidate for the support of the Republican party. "'Now that the smnoke bas cleared away" (to use the imaaginative language not unusual in political discussions), and wve can begin to learn how the nomination of Air. Buchanan is -received by the countly, I must say that I cannot learn that there is the enthusiasm. that I anticipated. With a united party North and South, with the Go-vernmenat offices in their control, and a reasonable probability of success, I supposed the nomnination would be recei.-ed more heartily than it has been. The cause for this is to be found in a distrust of the foreign policy which M1r. Buchanan's advisers will (it is supposed) force upon him. The Ostend Conference is not forgotten; and, tak-en in connexion with the Cincinnati resolutions, it miakes many Conservative men pause who wou-id otherwise have nohesitation. Tha Charleston papers denounce the Spirit of the Cincinnati resolutions as a-ggressive andunsound. Another Southern journal says it is not true that tne United States have any paramount interest in the seas to the south of them ; that both Spain and Great Britain have possessions there nearer to the isthmus than oiurs; and that the Cincinnati doctrines are therfore untrue. On the Kansas que-tion also the action of the Cincinnati convention has not received the party sanction 'which was anticipated. Mr. Hamlin, of Maine, an F out-and-out Democrat, of nine years' standing in the I Senate, and for many years past chairman of the very important Committee of Commerce, has -within the 'week resigned his position as chairmanl, because he could not follo vthe party lead, and has renounced the party ties 'which have hitherto held him. This iB an important indication of the manner in 'which the current sets wth the Northern Democrats of free-soil tendencies. Within the week, also, Mr. Fillmore's letter of acceptance has been received. In the North, 'where the real contest takes place, this 7will operate favourably for Mr. Buchanan, as Mr. Fillmore will dou'otless receive votes that-would otherwise be thrown for the Republican nominee. But his friends hope to do more. They hope to carry enough States to render a choice in the Electoral College impossible; and then, the choice being thrown into the House of Representatives, they hope to persuade the moderate men -of all parties t4 unite on him. The Convention in session at Philadelphia to-dayv w-ill put t-he third Richmond in the field. Present indications point towards Colonel Fremont, the geographer and traveller, as well as the owner of untold quarries of quartz, as their nominee; but I do not think that the best "posted" politician can give a predictiGn of the result that is worth much. The policy to be adoptedc will probably be non-extension of slavery,admission of Kansas as a free State, improvement of lakes and harbours, and the development of American industry without endorsmng the old doctrine of protection. It is also hoped that a " platform"' of foreign affairs will be adonted, which will neutralize the effects of the- planks put in at Cincinnati. At any rate, an effort wilt be made to that end. The opponents of the Acdministration in the North have been moving everything.in order to unite all the elements of opposition in the corning election. The Know-Nothings, wlho were dissatisfied with the nomination. of Mr. Fillmore, have substantially signified their willingness to support the Republican nominee. In order to secure the opponents to the Ostend Conference policy, it is possible that Conservative resolutions on this point wil be adopted. While the relations between this country and England continue so unsettled as at present business must remain uncertain. The general feelingis that nothing beyond possibly a temporary suspension of diplomatic relations -will ensne, and it is hoped that even that maybe avoided. Still- a contrary opinion is sufliciently common to make everybody sensitive. The Cabinet theraselves entertain no apprehensions. Indeed, the British Lion is quite a popular animal in Washington just now, since MIr. Marcy has pared his claws. Congress are about to vote to fit up the Resolute at the national expense and restore her to the British Government "as good as new,"and manv vwise Washington politicians think that if you reccive the present of a vessel that you had abandoned Lord Palmerston ought not to object to receive a lVlinister whom he would not abandon. Beyond apprehension as to howv the result will be received in London, the public interest in the enlistment question had died out. Both the people and the Government are more interested in the election of a President than they are in defending national sovereignty or enforcing national laws. The Cabinet has quite enough on its hands to keep Kansas quiet, tak;e care of California, aud- elect Ir. Buchanan, without figlhting the M\Iosouito fleet or meddling with Canad a. The late news from California is of the most extraordinary character. As you will probably receive from your regular- San Francisco correspondent full accounts of these things, I shall content myself with sending you tle California papers. Iy private letters assure me that there is no exaggeration in the representations of the deplorable state of things that prevails there, or in the determination of the Vigilance Committee to put dowvn the ruffians and gamblers. It is represented to me that through the influence of the Federal Goveranment such characters have got the upper hand, and held it until their rule has become unibearable, and there is a " strong clesire felt" on the part of many of the respectable and industrious citizens to cut loose from the Federal Government, and setup for themselves. How extensive such a feeling is, or how likely it is to remain after a vigorous purging by the Vigilance Committee; I anm not in a position to judge. The Vigilance Committee, which is composed of respectable men, seem-to have taken the adrmninstration of justice into their own hands. Affaiis in Kansas continue much as when I last wrote. There have been no fresh skirmishes, and no fresli destruction of life or of property. lDuring the week a propositionhas been beforethe Senate to send ~Gener[ Scott to the Tertory, charged with full powers, uxaeer~ the impression that his wellknownl decision and moderation and his success in llaying previous similar excitements would qualify him.for the arduous position now filled by Colonel Sumner.: The -Democrats turned a cold shoulder on the propositioun..

The important treaty of friendship and commerce, 'which establishes the most ample mercantile liberty between Chili and the Argentine Confederation, hLd beei duly exchanged in the capital, and was to be hence. forth considered as a law in beth countries. The treaty fixing the consular relations between that Republic and l2eewGranada,wasalso exchanged on the 9th. The CDUImissioners were Don Antonio Varas, TiTister of State' and Don Andres Laiseca, General Consul of )\'ew Granada. Both representatives availed themselves of the opportunity for entreating the President to grant a foll pardon to Juan Avendano, a native of New Granada, who had been condemned to death on acconnt of talking pert in the horrible mutiny of Juan Fernandez, and who was expiating his crime in the penitentiary, the sentence passed on hini having been commuted. There was every probability of the pardon bein- granted. The Valparai.so and Santiago Railvway would be opened fb Limakho on th.e 18th of September next. The movement in the.

The prospectus has been issued of a Californian project, to be called the Marysville Gas and. Water Company. The capital is to be 200,0001., in shares of 21. s., and the inducements to the enterprise consist in the facts that Marysville has a population of nearly 20,000, tbat the price of gas in California, judging from experience at San Francisco is 31. per 1,000 cubic feet, and that water at Marysville is paid for at the rate of 6d. per bueket.

The exports were 1,671 wheat. 300 quarters of malt, and 10 sacks of four. Of EngEsh wheat there were 9,127 quarters 3 of foregn mostly from the Baltic and Hamburg, 10,093. The morning's show of samples from Kent and Essex waS much below the average; but the extreme fineness of the weather, and oonsequent rapid advance of the crops, kepb millers so entizely on the reserve that trade was very slow, Bt unaltered prices. In foreign scarcely anything was doirg. The coontry flour supply consisted of 14,751 sacks, with 465 sacks and 1,000 barrels of foreign. Business was more laugnid than oflate, at former quotations. Town millers left the top price of four at 68s. There were 1,151 quarters of English and 1,713 quarters of foreign barley. The high price with fine weather re. strained business, but there[was no giving way onthe part of holders. Malt is now withdrawu from the market for recovery of duty. * The supply of oats was improvedto 23,647 quartern of wbich22,5092quarters were foreign, 3,036 quarters Irish, and the remainder British.

Of foreign beans there were 3,477 quarters, English only 310 quarters. Of peas only 240 quarters of native growth. The demand for both was slack, without difference of price. Of linseed the arrivals were 7,961 quarters, one parcel being from Riga. Exports, 960. Thecontinued active demand has rai_ed prices 2s. to 3s. per quarter; and cakes were 10s. per ton dearer.

Mn XrG. -Gseovz, the, iepratary, having read the advertie mnent convening theL meeting, the report, an abstract of which haz atppeared in 2's iirs, was taken as read. The CHiAiRmAN, iin moving- the- adoption. of -the repart anid statement of accounts said he was unexpetediy "flaed 'uor~.otalcethe chairinConsequence of the absence o-f their ch.j "L_ r. nderon'who-was: theni in attendance OIL .Governm nent in resjiec to the'Ansraizn sili2rvie.- He (the Chairman) ha no prepparedatany statement,; andpe- haps nobody knew snore abouLt theundertalsing.- than he ZI He believed theywvere very fortunite infthe appointment of 'their general manager, as he wrould ena'ble LthemI to Control 'their expenditure. Mr. Tergasson. L&Ad-been about three 'mor tbs. in office, and had maude himself acquainted, witha *everything. connected with -'tie undertaking. He (the 'Chauirmn) had no douLbt that, unider Mr. FergussaOns 'management, during the -next 12 maonthis something very satisfactory would be Accomplished. He -wasz to re-. veive A certain fired salarY' and to participate with I other officers of the company.-in a-apercentage of the' n-,t -profits, so that -their intarets -waxId :be identi-~ fied with those of the shaLreholders. alie efforts -of -thel directors and officers had been direct-ed to improving1 the revenue, in which they had stuceedaed to a Certain ex-, tent. In the capital accounts, owing to an error im[the, addition, it-was stated-that the tota exrpenditure.-would be, 1,329.000Z. ; the amount should have been. 1,328,000L;'--sta therefore they would rsquire!9D,3751., instead of 991,371.,; to be raised at present. The estishatedexpenditren caipi.:I tal account would be found -to, agree with -the. figures set! dwn:in the report, asa-. large amnount -of itnrd sinoe been. paid. As to the revenue, their anticinations with r-aspect' to it . had not been realized. The lestima%te h ad been fouinded on presumed -receipts; -whinle 'the expenses: were in excess on account Of preparations for the picture, galery, and -other departments of 'permanent attraction.

They had been obliged --o use the mnoney to mieet claims againist Capital, and when they couldberrownioney at areasonableratethey would xccoujp,the net revenue. Fromnthe state of the-noney-market which they hadl recently exprienced it 'wvas impossible to obtain mnoney at a reasonable rate; andit was not to be cz- pected they would borrow money at 7 per cent, while they could use the net revenue f or the purposes of the under. taking. The directors had at, least shown their zeal by raising mnoney on their own personal security; and1'hus they htd paid a large aTmount of debts. They had now plenty of time, andl would have plenty of -mesas to get the company through all its difriculties, He explained that the divden'd on the preference share whiceh was due on -the 31st of December last was not paid until March; 'but the dividend now due on t-he .30th of June would bee paid immediatey after tlle warrants were made out.. Mr. flEAS; thought the directors should nanie some. time for thepaprment of the 2s. dividend. 'The CwAntieA remarked that a great deal had been said aLbout shareholders having personal admissions; -hut, although he was anxious to- gratify them to every way, he believed such a course would be fatalto acommercial under. takng. - The uo-jidot have free asdiisiuneor andl dividends too; thei hf betr leave the management in the hands,of the-present hoard, and see what they couldd do with it.- The' palace had beeu open for a priod of ouly one -year-and ten. month% during -which it wa's in an ineosinplete state-, and. the price of provyisions had beeni so high as to seriously in-- terfe-e 'with tie meaul .of the worling classes. He believed' that, by proper mnanagement the undertaking could hbe, made apaying concern. He conclud'ed by moing the adoption of the renert and statement. of acoount-s.

It appears that several of the shareholdersito this corn. any have determined to oppose in the House of Lords a hall promoted by the directors for extending the railway from Glastonbury to BrLiton. The ground of oppositionl is that the above company obtained an act, last year autho- riigthe extension of t-heir line from Glustonbury to Well, and for making a pier at B-arnham at a cost of 93,0001., of 'which only a port ion of the capitrJ has been subscribed; and that if thle lie be not completed within 'five years fromi the passing of the act of last session the amtofdivdedso the original shares of t-he Somerset Wntralwill he stopped until the completion nf the extension to Wells.

The K'h:U0yde' Railway joined the Scottish Central at 'Stirling, and also Stirling aind Donferusline Railway. It passedLt the west of Stirling, aloxng the valley of the Forth, tillit came near the valley of the Endriek, when it proceededl down t-hat valley and touched on the Dembartonshire Rail. way at the foot of Loch Loniond. In this way access was obtained both to the Clyde and Forth. The Ie-nny Junction would join the Caledonian at Greenhill, -and run through Denny and a mnineral c-ountry till it touched the Forth and ClydelRailwayntthe backof Stirlin Castle. Henceaccesswasafforded to the Caledonian by the chain of railways at Stirlin)g and to the numerous importaint manufactories at the Leven, whither,~Wishaw and other mines-a sniight~be carried. The gentlemen of the district hadl undertaken to raise 65,0001. if the Caledonian CompanY -would subscribe the other 30,0001., making the 95,(001. required for the forrnation ofthe line. It was. arranged, further,thiat ifthe.Parliamenitary committee were not satisfied the Denny people would bear the whole e-xpease of prosecuzting the nseasure. ]Besides advnigt 3.01,teClcoin Coin- pany h hd arrnged -to work the le u nder a joinnt committee of management-three genltlemen belong. gto theo roprietors of theDenny Railway said three from th eCaledonianRailwav the CaCledoni'a to appoint a chair. tun, who, however, should be entitlle to no casting vote. The Caledonian Company should have the right to fbx the rates, and should get 50 per cent, for supplying plant to work the line. The Scottish Central Company had been promotinm a branch from Larbert to Denny, and the Paria- ientary 6ommittee had granted it to them- Hhad no oh- tiotio that and no fear that it -would hurt the other -line which nearly all the proprietors-manufacturers and erehants-in Denny were subscribers. He moved a resolution approving the bill. Mr. BRy6E szeconded the reslution.

I ILONDON VxGxZ1TioN v. LoNWox saroxE. TO TEI EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Ihave bec gardener to tho Ron. Society of A-eh lIner Temple 23 years. When I first entered their -ervce the Temple-gardens were very cdebrated'for white and zod roses, and I was surorisedinthe city ofLundon at the rose blooming at all Iheing a plant more sensitive to smol:e --tbn any other or the vegetabld kdngdom; still the old Provemce, cabbage, and maiden-blush bloomed here beautifuLLy. There were then only two steamboats on the iver Thaemes, that went to Richmond; but, as time'rolled on, by degre'ss Old Father Thames became crowded with thenm eve-y three or four minutes, and as -th-y pseed the garlens tht-y vomited out their clouds of smoke -on to my- poor roses -o such an extent that at las tbey ceased to bloom, and gr2dualy began to decay, To add to this nuisance aforest o Ieigh chimneys sprang up on the south side of 'Inei verr these, if possible, were worse than- the steamboats, envelc_'ingthe arden in emoke nightAnd day; ;.aU sorts of vegettion bga to dwindle, except chyssnteemums.. Somnefne oltime trees nandto growanilhbloombeautifully;tlieyccased to-bloom andalmosttohrow outa leaf; but, thaiks to our legislators, they paaed an act to manke these alominable nuisances discontne Such -has lbee the resalti of thi tlat, T am h py to- inform yoe,n this year my; poC roses that have Deen in the gardens so many years are ow fastrecovering their health and ehaow that they willnoh cease to blow, for I have a great many white ones coming, and eed also, and the plant bids well for healthy wood for anotlher year. The poor forest trees also are making stoots machbetter, althogtlthe spring has beeu s unfavourable to vegetation; nfact, evermtg in the gaTdenois greatly improving in health and vigour; tiy stocks have not b6eer so .ine for yewrs past. I don't want youato oke my opinionr on~it ; come and see, and judge for yourself. I chaUenae contradiction to this statemnent, and this is all through uppressing the smoke nuisance.- '- *Buti there is one thing I mnst beg to call yonr attentisin to. I was up thin morninz n little 'afic 3 o'clock at vsork, and I noticed several of tMe factories opposite take advantage inthe nigbt, and up tiU 6 this morning thov 3snt out a reat nautity of smoke. If they continue to do so mabch onger I will be up and watch them and find out their names and send them io you to expose them. Perhaps the proprietors are not aware of it; if not, serve the men as hIsi Green does at the Whitofriars Glasswrorks,-if his menn make more smoke than they can possiby help be flne em heavily forit; they won't do ita secondtine aterthat. There in another and far greater circumstance connected with these gardens than the vegetable world; the bencIers and members very liberally, at a great sacefice (if ccmscr and expense, alow about 200 families orders to walk in the gardens the whole year through. They also throw them open to the public after 6' o'clock in the evenirg, and on Sunday5. on fine evenings, we average frem i (0,000to 11,000 that pass in the course of tbe evening; the majority of -these are poor little sickly-looking creatures, penned upin the close lanes and alleys round the ne'ghnourhood, not old enough to get to the parks (as they would be tired in going there). I will tel yon what they put r,o in ndind of when they get on the lawn-a lit'le dog that bag been tied up all day, and let loose. They roll andl turr.ctle alout, kicking up their little legs on the grass: it-3ally does myheart good to see them; and I must coniess- 'tha+, o.t of such a number of little creaatures, and no one to lool after them except the officers of the gardens, Imrely have a fower plucke or a branch injured. Picture to yourEelf, Sir, these poor little children walding and rolling in clouds of smo}e for three hour;; ibhat goo;l can such an atmosphere do them, inflating their litte lungs with beastly smoke such as it was here two yearn back- 9 Whe, they came out they looked pile and tired ; now they go out with their lit'le eyes suarkling Lwith joy, run_ing and jumping like so many kittens, refreshed erm the change o air, and pleased with the treat. Andall t*is is caused by suppressing the smoke nuisance. I am, Sir. Your obedient servani. tS KKtin"!? Gardener to the Hon. Soct' tle June 26. Inner Teraple.
*B!IA AND NAPA~L INTELL_GENCE. hl ajesi'3y'emqe? two-decker St. Jean d'Acre, 101, tbptiin Geolge St. Vincent Eing, arrived at Spithead earlyyesterdny mornin:g from the Crimea, 'with the 3rd Mattalion of ;he Grenadier Guards, consisting of 23 officers, b1 sergeants, 19 drummers, and 1,023 rank and file-total of all rnlks 1,116-cinder the command of Colonel A. Foley. They wdil commence disembarking from the linevf-battle ship into tenders, 'which will land them at the Royl Clarence Victadling establishment, Gosport, this moniing fronm 8 to 12 o'clock; a special train will bo in waiting there to receive them, which will leave with them for Aldershott about noon. The fast and he&avy arrivals ,f troops from the late seat of war at Portsmouth have developed tha peculiar capabilities of the port and SouthWestern and South Coast Railways. They can sand up 5,000 men a-day, if called upon. On Saturday the DeputyAdsistnt-Qusrtermaster-General Wright (LieutenantColcnel) and Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General Nelson (Major) sent off 2,500, besides a battery of artillery and detb.hed troops, and had 800 carriages to spare after tiheir departure !

A claim was carried in by the Bank of Scotland as to a sum of 1,0001., with interest, secured by an instrament in the Scotch forms, purporting to be a bond (although not nIder seal) into which the testator had entered with one Frazer, whereby the principal debtor and his two sureties (the testator being one) became liable for the cash credits of such principal debtor. The Master to whom the cause was referred had previously disallowed the claim, and upon exceptions to tlhat finding in Juna 18555, by the Bank of Scotland, his Honour referred it back to him to review his report, aud cater into the question whether, assuming the bond to bo either Scotch or English, it was affectedby any statute of limitation. The master had made a further report, whereby he certified that the bank of Scotland had' a caim on the testator's estate, whether the document was Scotch or English, and that it was not affected by any statute of limitations. To this finally exceptions were again taken, but by two parties interested in the testator's generalestate. It appeared that the bond was executed in England by the testator, and that the executors gave no notice to the bank-. Mr. BAn s and Mr. So1yoand appeared in sulARD :pp of the exceptions, and argued that the security ceased with the death of Macean, which determinedthe suretyship; the ecntract was English, and the statute ran from the death, and more than six years had elapsed since that nime. Noreover, t was a legal demand, and the crea ould be tried at law. Mr. the nso tc r. HI law, and r. Gite Ai D suipported tho Master's finding, and argued that the question was one over w;hich this Court had perfect jurisdiction. Mr. Swanston and Mr. Schomberg appeared for the plaintiffs; Mfr. Bristowe for parties in the same interest as Thacited tI NheOR thought the document in question was a Scontch bond, and must bo regualated according to the Scotch law, and not only that the liability continuted under the instrumeent itself, but the liability for cash credits also continued until notice was given, and, as it was admittedi that the executers gave no notice to the bank,, the estate was responsible. The exceptions must be overruled, the exceptants paying the costs of the bank, with liberty to apply in respect of the costs of the exceptions. (Before rice-Chancelor Sir W. P. WOOD.) TRE AVRICAN STxSASMIP COcasrxxY V. SVA.rzY. The chief point of disclussion in t cis ase vws on the question of costs; this being the first case which had come before the Court of Chancery under the ferchant Shipping Act, 1854, The plaintiffs were owners of the Forerunner steamship, which was wrecked on her voeage from the coast of Africa by strikinzg on a reck. The ship with her eargo was wholly lost, and several of the passengers and crewv perished. The defendant Swvauxwas owner of apar t of the cargo, and had commenced an action for the amount sn the Court of Common Pleas. Another action had also been brouzght by the defendant Kiennedy, one of the passentgers, to recover the value of same of his property which had been lost with the ship. The plainttiffs thereupon instituted this suit nuder the provisions of the act (secttonts 504, 514) to have the value of the ship and freight asocertained, directions given for the purpose of ascertaining the persons who had any claim against them in respect of the loss of the ship, to hve the amount rateably distributed among those persons and an injunction restraining the actions at law, the plaintiffs admitting their liability to the extent of the value of the ship and freight, and its insulficiency to answer all tse claims which might be set up. The case has been before the Court on interlocutory applications, which have been reported in The Tmes, and among other things an order had been made for the payment into court of the value of the sEsp and cargo, such value to be verified by the affidavit of the managing director. This value was ultimately ascertained by arbitration at 5,9001., which sum had accordingly been paid in. The case now came on for hearing, and the contention arose as to whether the claimantswereentitledto interest on their claims from the tiune of that order being pronounced, and also as to whether the plaintiffs should pay the costs of the suit, ib being contended on the one hand that it was fair they should do so, the act having clearly been passed for the benefit of parties damaged; whereas the defendants contended that it was passed to benefit shipowners, by enabling them to come into this court and limit the number of actions which might be brought against them at law, and the provisions ofthenewact, which were in some respects different from those of the former acts, sufficiently showed that the intention of the Legislature was to give a discretion to the Court on the question of costs. Mr. kelt and Mr. Cairns appeared for the plaintiffs; *hr. WT. hf. James, Mtr. Cole, and Air. Giffard for the defendants. The VacE-CsA NiLIoR, after observing that the whole question seemed really to be in whose aid this act had been passed, said that the 514th section showed that it was intended as a boon to the shipowner, by giving him the opportunirt of applying to this Court to settle the l s of the various parties by wvhom he might otherwise be proceeded against in a court of law. Any claimant obtaining his right at law would have done so free of e.xpense, even in cases where the matter was disputed ; and looking to this, and to the discretion given to the Court by the act, his honour decided that the plaintiff's having taken advantage of its provisions were bound to pay the costs of the suit and of the actions, though that 'would net be the rule as to any costs occasioned by litigation betwveen adverse claimants, which there did not seem to have been in this ease. As to the question of interest, there was noyower in thu Court to giveit unlesssanctioned by the act; an it could not be contended that the mere order to pay the money into cou-t could operate in the same way as a judgment. The order was in the nature of security, and not of liquidated damages, and, therefoxe, there was in reality no sum which could carry interest.

The plaintiff in this action, Dr. Crane, was a general practitioner, living in lodgings at 46, Stanley-street, iinlico, and he sued the defendant, IL E.

The plaindtiff was cross-examined at some length to show that his medicine had not produced any benefit to his patients, and that lie was ms the habit of taking sins] sums in respect of medicines sold by Watts to patients for whom he (the plaintiff) had prescribed. Mr. JAarES caled the defendant, who distinctly denied the evidence given by the plaintiff. He said Wat Us had introduced the plaintiff as a nian who was very badly off, and who would b illig too tte.d him on his own terms. He accordingly engaged his o erviecs and paid him from time to time, giving him . for four visits, with which tle plaintiff had always expressed himself quite [stisfied. lii fact, the plaintiff had always expressed him. sefivery gratefu toto the defendant for bin kindness, and ad artkenof his hospitality, and so often that he eary lvadinthe defendant's house; a state of hitags whstinchth plaidtif in his evidence to-dayhad entirely ignored.

The?plamntiff in this action was a brickmnakir, and he sued the defendant to recever the sum of about SO1t, being the balance of an account of several hundred pounds due to the plaintiff for making bhilcls for the defendant, a railway cont-ractor. It appeared that the plainjtiff had been employed to snake a large num3Iber Of bricks for the defendlant. The defendant supplied all the materials and the plaintiff all the labour, for which he w1ss,to be paid at the rate of somuch per 1,000 bricks. Thiedefendant had setup a truck shop, and paid the plaintiff partly in mione_y an piartly in tiecketsfor provisions. One of these tickets was produced,in court. It had " 2s. (3d." on one side, and on the other these words -were printed-"1 This ticket is issued to th e beaer, by request, for his accommodation, and is nott compulsory." Accerding to the plaintiff's evidence, the taking of, the ticket 'Was compulsory, for he several times apopliedL to the defendant to be paid in moniey, hbut he could not get it, but only tickets. He had received 3231. in all, of which as much as 791. had been paid by these truck tickets. The main question now was whether the plaintiff could recover the sum of 791., which he had, in fact, been paid, but by truck tickets. i Mr. COLLiE submitte/1 that plaintiff wasan independent contractor, and not au artificer, workman, or labourer within the meaning of the Track Act (the Ist and 24 of William IV., c. 37), which said (eec. 3) that every payment made by any artificer in any of the trades nentioned mn the act otherwise than by the current coin of the realm should be null and void. In order to make that point more clear, he would pay the penalty and put in the agreement, which his L1rdship had said required a stamp. Lord CASIcBELL said, he would reserve that question for the opinion of the Court; but his Lordshipthought it would be rather unconscionable for the plaintiff to take a verdict for the full aulount of 791. M[r. M.isTY said, he was instructed that the goods supplied were charged at three times their value. Lord CAMPBELL said, the defendant was " in mercy, but he thought that If one-third were taken off that would he enough. Ultimately a verdict was taken for 38., being about half the amount claimed, leave being reserved to the defendant to move the Court to enter the verdict in his favour, if the Court should bo of opinion that the plaintiff was not within the act. Lord CAMnPBELL said, he was obliged to attend the House of Lords at 4 o'clock, and, as there was no short cause, his Lordship rose soon after 3 'clock for that purpose. SECOND COURT. (Sittings at NZsi Prius, at Guitd,cUl, before Mr. JudticC WIGHnrarus and a Conzmon Jstry.) BAR'NEWT AN]D WIVE V GOODLSOX. Mr. Lush and M1r. Pearce were coumsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. A. Chambers and Mr. Simon for the defendant. This was an action brought to recover compensation in damages for an injury the femnale pL intiff had received by the negligence of the defendant's servants. The plaintiff was an engineer's pattern maker, living at l)eptford, and his wvife was aL milliner arnd dressmaker, and the defendant wzas a contaclor under the Commissioners of Sewers. About 9 o'clock on a night in Noveniber last the wife was proceeding along the footpath in Mill-lane, Deptford, when she middenly found herself in a hole, but susuendedby her arms. A man below then called out " Take care." It turned out that the hole was what was called a " man-hole," and that the servant of the defendant had that night raised up the top and had gone down, leaving the top, or flap, or grating open. The poor woman at last exitricated herself, and went to Dr. Taylor, who attended her for some time, and ultimately she went to GUs's Hospital, and was for seom tie an outdwc'r patient of the hospstal. The learned JUDGE interoosed, and, the learned counsel having conferred, it was agreed to leave it to the jury to name a sum. Mr. JUStice WIGTAN then named 651. and costs, and a verdice was accordingly taken for that amount. LOUIS V. LLOYD. Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Welsby were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mlr. Hawkins for the defendant. This was an action brought by the plaintiff an attorney and under-sherifffor Denbigh, against the defendant for slander. The words complained of had been spoken to a person who had become a client of the plaintiff, and were these :-" I am afraid you have got into bad hands." The plaintiffhaving heard that the words had been spoken by the defendant wrote to hiin and. asked for an apology, or offered to leave the matter to the County Court judge. The defendant was an auctioneer, and had asked a person named Garner, a publican, for 101. which he owed him. Garner said he had placed his affairs in the bands of Mr. Louis, his attorney, upon -which the defendant said, " I am afraid you have got into bad hands." Garner liad got into difficulties, and had been much pressed by the defendant and other persons for the payment of money, and it was therefore sought to be inferred that the words had reference to the state of Garner's aff.airs,and not to the plaintiff. All Garner's property was sold, but only amounted to a few shillings. Two witnesses proved that the words were spoken. For the defendant it was alleged that the case was a trumpery one, and ought not to have been bronght into this coUrt; it ought to have been brought in the county in which the plaintiff was known. It was contended thxat the defendant was entitled to a verdict, as it was not shown in any way that the words, if suoken, had been uttered of the plaintiff in his profession of an attorney, but they were merely mentioned as if it had been said, " Why, you have got into the hands of attorneys, auctioneers, and creditors, who are selling you up, and you are in bad hands." Mfr. Justice WsGwrrA summed up. It was to be regretted that the action should have een brought up to London to occupy the time of the jury here. One question was whether the defendant really meant the words to have referenc to the plaintiff at all. If the words were not intended to apply to the plaintiff, then the defendant was entitled to a verdict. If they did, were they meant to refer to him as an attorneyl If they found for the plaintiff, they would say what damage he had sustained. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.

Hake were counsel for the plaintiff; MIr. Petersdorffappeared for the defendants. The plaintiff is a member of the College of Surgeons, and this was an action in which he sought to recover damages from the defendants for breaking and entering his house and seizing his furniture as for rent due from one Mlrs. Walters. The defendants, who are the landlord and brokers respectively through and by whom the trespasses complained of were connutted pleaded that the pL-intiff was not possessed of the house and goods in question. The plaintiff proved that he formerly lodged with the lady abovenamed, occupying unfurnished apartments in the house hired by her fromo the defendant Bond;- but that having given notice to her to quit not long before her quarter's rent was due, he-removed bisNfurnituro to the house which he had taesi on his owvn account. He had not been settled there many days when the brokers came and seized his furniture under a distress for 191. 0s., claimed tobe due for rent from his former landlady. In spite of his!protestations, the brokers persisted in entering, and during a scuffle which ensued, one of them vowed that Mrs. Walters was locked no in the parlour, and backed the vOW by asserting that he then and there saw that lady maying her escape bodily throughthe wiendow of the said pr our. AM this, however, wa an efforai of the imagination, for the piaintmi and srs. Walters now both swore that the latter was not in the house of the former on that occasion; and furthermore,h th the lady had nothing whatever to do with the house and goodas of the gentleman. The leass ed counsel for the defendant, by his cross-examination, sought to raise the supposition that there was some mysterious intimacy and community of iaterests between the plaintiff and Walters, but all that was elicited only went to show that while ati one time the ensteman lodged wi'.h the lady, at others the lady had lodged with the gentleman. EHe was about to address the jury and to call witnesses for the defendants, but The CsEE BMS.oN said that, unless the learned counsel wras prepared with direct evidence in contradiction to the case of the plaintiff, it would be but an idle waste of time to contest the property in the goodis. It was a mere question of damages. MEr. Serjeant ssoasA here offered to takse a verdict for the mere value of the goods, to which the defendants counsel ullimately?sssented; whereupon the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff with 20l. damages. COULSeo V. TOMLIXSON. Mr. Collier and Mr. Cross were counsel for the plaintiff Mr. Overend and Mr. Honyman appeared for the defendant. The defendant is Serjeant-at-Mace in the Derby Court of Record, against whom this action was brought for a false return of isula. bona in answer to a writ of fjcrifacias issued by the plaintiff on a judgment recovered by him against one Green. It appeared that, while the plaintiff's action was progressing to judgment, Mr. Green, -who was deeply embarrassed, and owed one Kerson 1001 on a note to which one Lees had become a party as a surdty, took stops to defeat him. He accordingly assisted Lees, who had bcen threatened by Kerson, to a judgment for 1001. in the Derby Court of Record, and, by consent, an action was brought against him by Lees, and judgment obtained, execution issued, and levv wiade in the short space cf half an hour, just three or four days before Mr. Coulson co'ld obtain the like result in the ordinary course of things, The -consequence was that the defendant, )who was indemnified by Lees, paid over to thab gentleman 79i. Os. 8d. as the proceeds of the execution, and returned " no effects"' to the writ of the plaintiff> who brought this action, contending that the proceedings at the suit of Lees were not bond Jide, and could not afford protection to the defendant, especially as he had acted after notice of their defective character. At the close of the plaintiff's-case, The Cn31 BARoss suggested that the case resolved itself into a question of law; that question being whether the defendant, being liable to pay a sum of money for Mr. Green, was a creditor of thut gentleman- so as to he enabled to take proceedings to judgment against him It was sug. gested that the proceedings of Mr. Lees were'not bondjide, but a thing was bond fide which was what it professed to be. A debtor has by the law of England perfect right to prefer one creditorover another, and the rapidity of these proceedings only went to prove how great the necessity was for hurry to accompalish the object in view. I believe that Ir. Lees, being liable for Mr. Green on the note for 1001., was a creditor of Mr. Green, though ho had not paid anything for him; and I shall direct a verdict for the plaintiff, with leave to the defendant to move to enter a nonsuit. Verdict for the pulaintiff for 791. Os. 8d., accordingly.
POLICE. BO3 -STMIuT.-The charge preferred by the Commis sioners of Ilmacy against Mr. Charles Snape, the restdent medical superintendent of the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum at WTandswortn, was again brought under the con. sideration of Ifr. HmERy yesterday afternoon. Mr. Bodkin attended as counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Clarksort appeared for the defendant. 3r. John :Forster, the secretary to the Commissionrers of Lunacy, and several medical gentlemen of eminence were also present. The.case wvsremanded. from Monday week. It will be remembered that the offence charged against Mr. Snape was t;hat he had cifsed the death of an aged lunatic, named Daniel Dolley, on the 9tb of April last, by subjecting him to a cold shower-lath of nearly half an hours durtion, fol- lowied by a strong dose of tartar emetic, it being alleged on the pat of the prosecution tlat such treatment was designed as a punishment of th3 deceased lunaticforhavingcom. mitted an assault upon the defendant. The follovwing additional evidence was attached to the depositionsg- Mr. Francis W. Shield; deposed that he is a civil eDgineer, living at Charles-street, Westminster. On the 13ta of May last he accompanied Mfr. Vignolles, civil engineer, to the Wandsworth Lunatic Asylum for the purpose of examiningashower-bath. Theytookthe dimensions of the bath and made a drawing of it. The size of the box in which the person stands was 1 foot 7 inches square, and the height 8 feet 3 inches, exclusive of the cistern (2 feet). It was enclosed with wood panelling, aud when the door was closed it was secured by an iron bar outside. There 'was no window, aperture, or opening of any kind, excepting the holes in the perforated plate through which the water falls at the top and escapes at the bottom. There was a cistern over the bath 7 feet 1IQ inches long and about 2 feet wide. It was supplied with a self-acting ball and cock, and the depth of the cistern from the surface of tho water was 17 inches. There was a plug at the bottom of the cisten to allow the water to pass into the bath, and a chain was attached to it, but a person inside had no control over the chain. Witnes examined thisbath with the view of ascertainink what quantity of water would fall into the bath per minute. During the first minute and three quarters the water would faU more heavily than afterwards, as it took about that time to exhaust the quantity accumulated in the cistern. After this first rush the water would flow regularly from the tap-supply, at the rate of 19A gallons per minute. The perforated holes in the plate were about the eighth of an inn manize. Thototal quantity in 28 minutes would be 613 gallons. Cross-examined.-The outer dimensions of the servicepipe were an inch and a quarter. The quantity of water discharged in the first minute and three-quarters woald be 106 allens. T'he discharge would be lees afterwards, and continue in the same proportion per mninute. te-examined,-I saw the source of the water Eupply. It camne irom a mnuch larger tank in a higher part of the building Dr. Hugh W. Dimond, resident medical superintendent of the female departuient of the Surrey Lunatic Asylum, deposed that he -ad been in the institution about six or seven years, and the defendant held a similar situation on the male side. Knew a patient named Daniel Dolley. He was not exactly a violent, but an excited and foolish atient. lHis health was very good. Witness firslt eara of his death on the 9th of April, from Mr. Snape, the defendant, who came to the surery and informed him of the occurrence. About an hour previously Mr. Snape had asked witness to do duty for hinfor the day, as he wanted to go to the Crystal Palace, and consequently when witness saw him he asked how it was he had not gone. The defendant replied, "I have had a very unpleasant occurrence. Doley was very excited, and carae behind me and struck me a blow." Witness said, " Did he hurt you?' MIr. Snape said, " It was a wood sharp blow. I ordered him a half-horr shower-bath. casie out not much the worse for it, but he died directly after." Witness said, "Did he die directly?i" He replied, " He had put Oei his stockings and partly dressed himself." Witness said, H How came you to give him a shower-bath of such lona duration?' Mr. Snape answered, "I never did so before. I was never struck before by a patient." Some conversation took place upon the subject, and witness said, "If you could avoid a coroner's innuest it would be desirable, for it would be an unpleasant business. 'Under any circumstances, you mus write to the chairman, and treat it as a case of sudden death," meaning the chairman of the visiting justices, it being usual to apprise them of all sudden deaths. Witness said, "In all probability the man disd of disease of the heart." Ir. Snape made no reply. Witness did not know at this time that Dolleyhad been placed in the narrow shower-bath.. The others are milder. Something was said about a post ezo-tss examinat-.ion, hut witness could not remember who commenced the conversation. Witness agreedto bepresent if one took place. He saw no more of Tr. Snape that day, but subsequently wrote a note to him,after looking at Dolley's body, vhich was peculiarly white. [The note was handed to Mr. Burnaby, the chief-clerk, and read, as follows :-"I fear tlat Dolley's case is more unpleasant than at first appeared, and that you will be obliged to have au inquest-which will be disagreeable, but less so than otherwise."] Witness continued :-After leaving the letter Mr. Snape came to my surgery. le said,-1 T agre ewith you," alluding to my letter, and said he had informed. or would inform, the steward to go to the coroner. He said, " I will make a post se-tens examination " and I consented to be present. He added thst " Blake and other patients had got hold of it, and thab he (Blake) had said he would never rest until he had got shower-baths abolished." During this conversation I said to Mr. Snape, " You never told me a word about the emetic." He said, " I did inform you of it yesterday." I replied that I never heard anything about the emetic till Barnett (one of the attendants) told me that he had given Doley a goddose. Mr. Snape said a grain and a-half. I have oeen struck bya atientonce, namedO'Leary. Inreference to this U told Mr. Snape that I gave him gruel and weak diet for a week, and we have been capital friends from that time to this. On the 10th I met MIr. Snape near the dead-house, 'here Dolley's body had been placed, and, my son having come up at the moment, Mr. Snape, I beheve, asked him to conduct the post mortes examination. Myson had just passed the College of Surgeons. The body was lying on the table, and I saw that the head and chest had been opened. 3fr. Snipe remarked that Sandy (one of the attendants at the dead-house) had done more than he was told to do. It was no part of Sandy's duty to open any pat of the body, although Mr. Snape said he had frequently done so before. I had made an observation about the head being opened, seeing that a portion of fluid had drained out of it. My son proceeded -with the examination. I saw nothing in the state of the brain to account for death. The spinal cord was examined and looked healthy. The chest had been opened reviouslg but no part of its contents had been removed. vy son cut throogh the pericardium, upon which Mr. Snape said, " There is evident disease of the heart." I said that I saw none. He replied " It is larger than it ought to be." I said, for a man of his years, it was much what I should have expected to see. The vessels were then cut, and the heart taken out. A great quantity of blood gushed out. My son proceeded to examine the heart, cutting into the several canties. There was a little thickening of the semilunar valve of the aorta, also a small substance about the size of a wheat-grain, at the base of the tendinous cord. It was cut open, and seemed to be a mere thickening of the membrane lining the heart. There was nothing in the condition of the, heart, notwithstanding these appearances, to denote disease. There was nothing muusual in any other part of the body. Mr. Snape left the dead-house vwith me. He said, " I suppose we may safely say that the man died of disease of the heart." I replied, " In my opinion, there was nothing there to shorten a man's life." This took place the day after Dolley's death (the 10th of April), and the inquest was held on the foUowing Saturday, the 12th. On that day Mn. Snipe came to me. Hfe said the inquest was about to take pdace that afternoon-I cannot remember his exact words, hut he said something aboult the heart, and expressed a wish that I should attend the inquest. I said, "Nlow, do you not think that if the man had net had the shower-bath, and emetic afterwards, he would be alive now P' He replied, "I cannot say that." I said, "That is my belief," and we parted. I did not go to the inquest. On the following Monday I asked my son to fetch the heart from the dead-house. I washed it carefully, and then I observed a slight ossific deposit on the aorta, and in conjunction with the semi-lunar valve which had been thickened. Consequently I went to the dead-house and examined the remaining aorta there to see if there was any continuation of that disease. I found there vas none. I then closed the body, and returned to the surgery to make a more careful examination of the heart, 'which confirmed me in my opinion thlat there was no disease there to cause a mad's dcath. I placed the heart in a jar, and the same evening took it to the dead-house, but found that the body had been buried. I took the heart back to mysigery. The next morning, having an appointment with Mr. Waterhouse and another medical gentleman, I was advised to show the heart to Mr. Paget and Mr. Hancock, the surgeon, of Charing-cross. ] showed the heart to both these gentlemen on the Thusday morning. I called on Mr. Lawrence, but did not show the heart to him, being perfectly satisfied with Mr. Paget's opinion. Some time after these occurrences I was summoned before the Commissioners of Lunacy. I had previously examined the heart, at the suggestion of Mr. Paget, with a microscope, and found no change of stracture, or other unnatural appearance. I submitted the small thickening substance to the microscope also, and found that it was merely part of the serous menmbrane, with the muscular fibre passing through it. The heart remained in tay surgery till Saturday, the l9th. At about 9 o'clockthat evening I smelt something very offensive and looked to the mousetrapto see if there was a dead mouse there. Finding, ho,vever, that it proceeded from theheart, I rolled it into the ashes under the firegrate and burnt it. Mr. Bodkin.-Now, from your knowledge of all that took place, to what circumstance do you attributo the death of the deceaned V Witness.-I attribute it to the treatment he received on the day of his death-to the shower-bath and emetic. MIr. Clarkson.-I decline to put any questions to this witness, Sir. I intended to have cross-examined him at great length, but- Mr. EYR.-You need not explain your reason for declining. Mr. Warner Hastings Dimond, son of the last witness, corroborated the foregoing evid6nee, and stated tbat lie saw nothing in the heart of the deceased to account for death. Cross-examined.-The thickening of the aortic valve is a disease, but insuficient to accounCtefr death. I cauneot say whether I pointed it out to my father at the post start ens ex amination, saying "TZhere is disease of the heart." Mlr. James Paget, surgeon, of Henrietta-street, Cavendishsquare, deposed,-I remember Dr. Dimend's having subnutted a heart to me for examination in April last. He said, "Ilwishou to give me youropinionas to whether there is any disease here." I was not informed of the eircumstances or of the age of the deceased. I noticed a slight thickening of the valves of the aorta, which is not an unusual thing in persons of the age of Dolley, the deceased. There was also a similar thickening of the edge of the nitral valve. Them was nothing. as far as I had an opportunity of observing, to account for death. Alr. Bodkin.-Having heard the endence, what do you believe to be the cause of death ? Witnesa-I di not know what might be the effect of the bath and emetic - uposi excited lunatics, having had no ex perience ; but in the ease of an ordinary man of 65 I should think such treatment likely to prove fatal. Cross-examined.-The heart had been opened when I saw it, but it was not decomposed. I have had no experience of excited lunatics. Mr. Bodlin.-Although you have had no experience of excited lunatics, is it your opinion, as a physiologist, thut there would be any material difference in the effect produced by such treatment upon a lunatic and -upon a sane pbrsonZ, Witness,-I ahould like to be understood as expressing an opinion only. I was in this court at the last examina. tion, and heard, to may surprise, that patients had been exposed to the shower-bath for 20 minutes, without injury, in the Surrey Asylum. - This acitec so much sarpnise in my QrindthatI should be very cautiousin sayiaghow much Of Ithat treatment might be administered to ^ patient, in my iopinion, without danger. - hMr. HEicrt.-What isayour Opinion as to the effect of the tartar emet:c 9 Witness.-I should think the effect, following a showerbath, would be considerably to increase the danger. By lfr. Clarkson.-This would be so whether vomiting took place or not. Mr. Henry Hancock, of Harley street. Cavendish-square, surgeon to Charing-crosseHospital, examined.-I remember aheart being submaitted to mne for examination by Dr. DTinond, and saw nothing about it to account for death. There were tho thickening appearances described by the otbher witnesses, but they were not uncommon in a person agedc 65. Havi3g had no experience of the treatment of lunaties, I am mclined to snake the reservation expressed by IMr. Pnt - but there was nothing else to account for death. I k a shower-bath of 28 minutes, and a subsequent emetic, would be fatal to an ordinary person, most pzobably. Or. Elliotson, exanined.-I have heard the evidecDe in this case relative to the Ehower-bath and tartar emetic administered to the deceased lunatic; and I have also heard the description given of the appearance of the heart after death. In my judgmsent the long-continued shower-bath and the dose of emetic occasioned the patient's death. In arriving at that conclusion I have considered tlat the man was a lunatio. Cross-examined.-No doubt, a highly-excited lunatic would bear more than a patient -who was not excited. Mr. Bodkin.-But if the lunatic went in quietly, and remained quiet, as was the fact in this case? Dr. IMlliotson.-If he went into the bath quietly, and remained quiet the effect would be the same as upon a sane person, I imagine. I have seen the bath since, and tried it. I remained in -it for S manutes and 40 seconds, and was very glad to get out of it again. It was very disagreeable. M)r. Clarkson.-Bnt then you did not go in as an excited lunatic, I presume, which makes all the difference. (A laugth) IDr.Elliotson_Nto dou'ct, insane persona will endure whiat sane persons cannot-cold and frost, for instance, which would' be fatal to a sane pcerson; but cold and frost have also killed lunatics. Circumstances necesscarily vary. By Mr. Bodkin.-The temperature, being much coider in April than June, must have made the bath much more trying to the deceased; but even at the end of June I found it very dreadfu. (A Clarkson.-It was not so agreeable as mesmerinm. (A laulgh.) Dr. Elliotson.-By no means. I should like you to try th.^ difference. (Laughter.) Mr. Bodkin.-It has been proved that there was frost on the morning ivhen Dolley -was exposed-not to eight, but to twenty-eight minutes of this bath. Mr. Clarkson denied that any such statement was in evidence. Mr. Bodkin.-Then, it will be proved hereafter. The case for the rosecaution having closed, -)L-. Clarkson intimated that he should reserve his client's defence for the triaL It was lfr. Snare's wish, from the onset, that the case should be fully inqmred into, and therefore he should not oppose the proposition to send the matter before a Jury. The defendant was then conimitted for trial at the next Old Bailey Sessions, bail being accepted. The R1ev. 11. Franklin Chambers. rector of Wandsworth, and Captain W. G. Edwards, of Heston-lodge, Bromley, were accepted as the defendant's sureties in 1001. each. iL4Annor,ouGo-sTRmsr.-John Jeffrey, coachman, was charged with stealing a mare value 50 guineas, the property of Mr. Rich, Mx., of 28, Chapel-street. Mr. Rich said the prisoner had been his coachman for several years. On Saturdayweek he went out of town, and he gave the prisoner instractions to erercise his mare during his absence. On Tuesday he retermed to town, ancd he sent his footman to the stables to tell the prisoner to bring the mare round to him. The servant returned, and brought back an answer that the prisoner had gone to the Veterinary College with the mare. About 5 o'clock on the same day he saw the prisoier, and asked him why he took the mare to the college -without having first consulted him. The prisoner replied in a confused manner that the mare had k;icked during the night, and bad injured her foot, 3Xesides loosening the nails in one of her shoes. Not feeling satisfied with this explanation, be wrote to the chief surgeon at the college, and the following evening he received a reply which stated that his mare had nob been received in the institution. He accused the prisoner of havimg deceived him, and the prisoner then said that the mare was in some stabies in the Liverpool-road. He went there with the prisoner, but the prisoner pretended that he could.not point out the stables, and in onsquence of the previous false statements and subsequ3ent prevarications he gave the prisoner into custody. Theprisoner, who appeared to be in a state of mental confunon, gave no account of w^hat he had done with the mare, and wfas remanded for a week. A 51.-note in halves has been received from " HL T." for the poor-boxs. Oanunmswxun.-Mr. Walter William Wombwel was charged before Mr. CORRIE with unl.awfully beating Israel Hyman, and also with ietting a dog on him. Mr. Lewis appeared for the complaint, and Mr. Wakeling for the defence. Israel Hyman said,-I am the son of David Hyman, No. 4, Clyde-terrace, Caledonian-road, iron-merchant. My father sent me yesterday on an errand, and by mistake I went into defendant's yard, at Winchester-street. Defendant was there. I asked him, if Giles, an engineer, lived there. He said, "No." I was walking out, andhe said, ' Move on." He came behind me and gave me a push. He struck me on the back of the neck, hicked me twice with his lnee, and, calling the dog that was loose in the yard, said "Go along," and tbe dog instantly flew at me. The first time it braised me in the face-I think -^ith his nose. The dog jumped on me again, and bit me on the ear; it bled very much. Then the defendant struck me again, and pushed me out of the yard. I have been to the hospital and had my ear sown up. I was in pain all night. Cross-examined.-Before I went down the yard I saw a man with a vwheeL He did not speak to me. I did not speak to him. When defendant camne after me he said, "' Go a little faster." He set the dog on me. i saw two men there. I was not in the yard more than three minutes; that is while the dog was biting me as welL Re-eamined.-lf the dog had not delayed me I should not have been in the yard more than a minute. George Needham said,-I live at NTo. 12, St. Jamess-terrace, Caledonian-road. I saw complainant going into the yard. I saw down the yard. I saw the defendant there. I savhim catch hold of the boy and kick him with his knee. I heard him whistle for the dog. The dog came and jumped up twice. The second time the dogbit the boy's ear, and then the defendant shoved the boy out of the yard. When the defendant seized the boy he was proceeding towards the gate, and the dog seized him. He was then standing still. Oross-examined.-I know the dog. He oft_ plays wvith children. I have known him bite one boy. I have seen him play -with the children two years. I havo seen him play with hundreds of children. When the dog bit the other boy I saw the defendant makle signs to the dog, That was in the Wharf-road. There is a wicket to the defendant's gate to prevent any one gomg in-a sort of bar. Mary Richards, widow, said,-I live at No. 12, All Saintsstreet, Caledonian-road. Yesterday, about 12 o'clock, I was looking out of my window, and saw defendant pushing the boy very roughly out of the yard, and when he was ssbe mimetherc was a black dog jumping round the boy. osthe yard, hegot to the gateway defendant struck the boy, and then ho set the doi on the boy, and the dog bit the boy's ear, and after the- dog it the boy defendant kicked the dog and thennhe stck the boy again. I saw the boys ear bleed. Cross-examined.-Therewas a man in astable at thebatIom of the yard, bathe did not come out. Mfr. Coanr- said it was a most serious case, and expressed his intention of sendi o it before a jumy; hut nr. d akehing and it r. Lesw is hasing consulted together, tho latter announced to MEr. Carrie that thr. fombowell had consented to givo the complainat 5l.e and pay al exzpenses. the compLainant's father then presented a guinea to the poor-box. Ti ha.-er. Charles wMngnay, of the firm of Yotug, Son, and Mag-y, shipbuilders, limehouse, whose men are en strike in consequence of the firm introducing new ronelations of the hours of labeur, came before Mfr. SEday, and stated hat it wvas with considerable reluctance he again troubled tte magistrate. On Friday last the firm to which he belonged prosecuted a shiponight named Denton, who bad enteredy o to a contractl to work for them underthe neworegulationsnfor 6a. per day for 12 months. The man himself haddeclred his willingness to enter 1upon the oontraot, but had bean tamrxered with and intimidated by the Uinion men, Elis wrorship had expressed an opinion that th casewasmade out,batheand hismpartners, havine g no wish topunisthe man, consented to his release on his prormiseto observe the contract and commence work as a ahipwright. Denton came to the yard on Saturday, and worked for a few hour3, and then left, and had not since returned. Mr. Suns-n observed that the man had been trealed very mercifully by Messrs. Young, Son, and lMagnay, and he wvas Lvery sorry the defendant had broken faith with them. H[e wrould granlt a warrant for the apprehension of the man under the second part of the clause in the a.t of Parliament, for leaving off w,ork after entering upon his contract without the permission of his employers. Mr. Mfagnay said that nine shipwrights had entered into a contract with their ag3nt at Southampton to work for them for 12 months at 6s.~ per day. The men came to Lou- don, -were sought after by the Shipwrights' Union, and tampered wsith. They had not commnenced work at al. Mr. SELvE.-AIe they in london? Er. Magnay.-Yes, Sir. MIr. Snsriv-What reason do they aSSign for not coming to work?7 Mr. Magnay.-NTone at all, Sir. When they signed the sgreement they said they were quite satisfied with our terms and our regulations; but we know that our yard is like a beleaguered fortress; mnen are constan-ly watching from a pubhichouse window all that is going on within; there are spies and scouts at the corner of every street near the yard; the men we engage in the country aro intercepted at the railway stations; and we believe intdation has been practised.' here are enty ofmen anxious t) work for n s, but they arerevented doing so by a tyrannical and inquisitorial trbunb ai which interferes with the freedom of labour, and has agents all ever the kingdom. * r. SZxarn-Have you the niamea of the nine men! Mr. Magnay.-Yes, I have, Sir, and will read them. Mr. SxLvn said he would grant warrants for the appre. hension of the nine men. Mr. Magpay.-I would rather have summonses; I don't want to lock the men up. Mr. SnRs-x recommended warrants, and they were made Out. Captain Richard Cammingson, the master of a Sunder- land collier, was brought up on remand before Mr. ELF. charged with cutting and wounding John Neale. 3Mr. SrcFB sad he should send the case before a jury, who vould decide whether any snd what provocationwas given, or whether the prisoner was justidfed in inflicting the wolund& - He-would-take bil for th6e xianei -appearCAsG Iat the sesslons.
