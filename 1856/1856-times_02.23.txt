The late ExrErOR had more than ona object in view when he used his possession of the delta to impede the corn tlade of the Principalities, and when he marched h-is armies to Bucharest to allay -what he called a revolutionary ferment. He wished to increase the importance of 0Odessa and the -wealth of his own southern provinces. 'Uhatever might be the fate of his designs on Turkey, he wished at least to exalt his own empire by repressing the improvement of his neighbour. For this purpose Quarantines and Customs awaited each vessel that entered the -Danube. For this purpose the Sulina mouth was. allowved to accumulate yearly an increasing deposit of mud. It was also politic to diminish a prosperity which might create satisfaction. If the' Wallachians flourished, and sold their corn under the supremacy of the SULTAN, they might soon forget their traditional wrongs, their 'assalage to an infidel, their plunderin 'by Phanariotes in the old times, and the more modern' extortions of commissioners and native Eospodars. To keep them in poverty and to represent poverty as the effect of Turkish rule,-to keep them in ignorance, and turn ignorance into a perpetual fountain of religious hatred,-to restrict their trade, and then show by the prosperity of Odessa 'or Taganrog how' flourishing trade could be imder Russian rule-such was the policy of the CzAn, and, if followed out with the skill with which it was planned, it might possibly have gained his end. But, happily, pride, or over-confidence, or what used to be called judicial blindness, urged the Russian Sovereign to strike a blow wvhich failed of its effect) but was enough to rouse the world, and overthrow the schemes of a long reign. Perhaps' dread of the rapid progress of the provinces caused the invasion of 1853, a step weich seemis to have been suddenly decided on, and can hardly have been contemplated when the Cz.n withdrew his troops three years before. WVhatever may. have - been the motive, the result -was to awake-n Eiirope to a sense of danger. We can ihardly fail' to recognize something like fatalty in the infatuation of the Russian Sovereign. There was but one course which could make. Austria his enemy,' and that course he decided to tike. If he had sent's fleet tothe Bosphorus, ormarcled onErzeroum, the Court of Vienna would have been his friend, or at any rate contented itself with 'private remonstrance; but the occupation of a country on the Austrian frontier, the seizure of a river which chiefly conneeted Austria with the East, and to the navigation of Which she looked for the increase of a lucrative traffic, -were sufficient to destroy all the effect of common sympathies and benefits conferred in time of trouble. It has been plainly seen not only by the Western nations, but by a Power' more immediately conceried, that the. Danubian Principalities must be hereafter strictly guarded and -wisely administered. They are, in fact, the Belgium of the East,'not only in their fertility and capacity for commercial progress, but in their position between great and warlike empires, which cannot help looking uipon them with desire, or at least withanxiety, lest they should fall into a rivalrs hands. If the Ottoman empire generally is to be brought into the European system still more important is it that these Christian provinces, placed in a situation of such danger, and without the power of self-defence, should pass under the protection of public law. ' We learn from our Constantinople correspondence that the conferences respecting the MoldoWallachian territory commenced on the 8th of this month, andl had been continued every afternoon during four days. It must be allowed, for the credit of t'e Ambassadors, that they have lost no time in pl ecing before the Ottoman Ministers the wishles of t4teir respective nations. 'We cannot help also' doing justice to the readiness of the SurTAx's advisers to concede all that his allies may fairly demaand. In such a country as Turkey much, indeed, depends on tlhe manner in wvhich a decree or convention is carried out, and rwe have not hesitated to show how in many cases a reform, admitted with specious candour and goDl faith, has been nullified by the very men -who have gained credit in Europe by its adoption. It is to0 much, however, to forebode that in the present instance any such dishonesty will be practised. The lessons of two eventful years have not been lost even upon Pashias, and the presence of' large armies will give strength to the representations of European advisers. We are-bound to believe that what has been promised will be executed, or that the fault will rest, not on Turkley alone, but on all -who are parties to the stipulations of the Fourth Point. If, then, the diplormtists of Constantinople concluide their discussion .in the spirit with which they have begun, 'we can have little doubt that a final settlement is at hand w-hich will give tranquillity to Turkey and Austria, and a long career of prosperity to the Principalities themselves. In the present case the Porma has not -waited to receive proposals from the Ambassadors, but has' voluntarily laid before them a plan of its own. The Ottoman !Iinisters propose to return to the old constitutions guaranteed by the SrLTXNS to whom the Principalities sub-' mnitted in 1392 aud 1513: The chief points of these are the independence of the provinces as to internal government, the suzerainty, of the SuLTs-', and the paymiizt of a fixed tribute. In effect, it is proposed'-to take as a point of departure the political state of'the provinces before Russia gained her right of Protection, befere.the corruptions of the Greek Hospodariate' commenced, and the- mouths of the Danube had faIlen under hIuscovite dominion. The Principalities will at first form self-go'rverning' States, with the Stmz&N as liege lord. Then, if we understand it rightly, modifications 'may be proposAd, and, by' the assent of the S=ir, may oecr e valid.' Thus the 'question of uniting the two provinces iuder one chief is of much i3. .portance, and is, no doubt, icceiving the 'attention' of the negotiators.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OP LORDS, Fbiday, Feb. 22. The Loud Coascellor took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock. The interest which the question of the "Wensleydale petiJgeh-g excited was evident from the unusually large number cf peers present, the full attendance of peersr-sons behind ihe woolsack, and the crowd of ladies and strangers in these parts of the house designed for their accommodation. THE WENSLEYDAXE PEERAGE. Xord GLENELG, in rising to propose the reference to ihe judges of certain questions of which he had given notice, said, he was not about to enter upon the merits of the question, nor was it for him to discuss whether tho instruments cn then- lordships' table were legal or illegal; neither should he discuss whether it was expedient or wise to raise the question at the present time. But he felt it to be his duty, as a member of that House, in tho position in which it was now placed, to consider what was tho most prudent course io adopt. It appeared to him to be oneof the most important subjects ever brought under the consideration of that .House, and should bo considered with all thc advantages of ihe assistance and counsel which the constitution of the country had provided. That was tho object ho had in view in making the motion which he was now about to submit." He wished to know why, in this case, far more important than ihose cases in which that advice and assistancawa3 usually obiained, the samo course was not to be pursued, and why the House was upon this occasion to be deprived of that valuablo assistance ? It was well known that from time immemorial the constitution had provided for that House certain constituiionaladvisers, and when those great legal authorities were appointed they received a writ fromthe Sovereign directing thcr-to attend and advise that House. That had been itpractice from a remote period, and was not now obsolete, the judges being perpetually called upon to give advice in matters of great importance. Members of that House were liable tobe carried away by temporary excitement, arising, perhaps from tho most generous motives, which must bo the case in any assembly of men of spirit and honour, and, inconsequence, the House might bo led into adopting rash and precipitate measures ; but the constitution had provided rt remedy, giving them the aid of men selected by tho Sovereign for thoir high posts on account of their professional knowledge and wisdom-men who liad no interest but for thenational good, and free from excitement or passion of any description, men who entered not the stormy arena of politics-dispassionate advisors, called upon, not to control ihe decision (hear, hear) or to bind the House by their opinions, but to give theirlordships all the assistance which eminent wisdom, knowledge, and experience could afford. That was a noble institution, and he would ask again, why had not their lordships availed themselves of it on the present occasion ? The decisions and measures of the House were looked forward to with interest by the whole country, and whatever the decision might be, if those learned men to whom he had referred were consulted, it would have -greater weight and authority with the country. (Hear, hear.) For their lordships to divest themselves of that aid would be wilfully to impair tho gravity of .their proceedings. It might suffice to rest his caso there, but ho confessed, as an independent peer of Parliament, he found himself placed inr. position which required peculiar consideration. He was no party to the proceeding which originated the discussion, it was as new to him as to any member of that House, but ho found himself called upon to decide upon measures of great constitutional importance-measures connected with the law and tho constitution of the country; and he ventured to ask-for he beheved other peers felt the same difiiculty-whother the House ou£ht not to have recourse to those persons espenally nominated to afford assistance ? They had heard many grave and able arguments, but he would inquire, with a_ deference to noble and learned lords opposite, whether thoy formed proper substitutes for those learned personages to whom he had alluded? Tho noble and learned lords who MdnKc. able legal arguments upon this question shared the feelings, and, it might be, the prejudices of other members of that Houso; but the attene-rnce of tho law officers of the Crown and the judges in all cases where the peerage was concerned was an indispensable adjunct in the deliberations of that House. With aU deference to noble and learned lords, and admitting tho ability with which they had argued the matter, he admitted he found himself in a. ^T5**3 °^ greater uncertainty than he liad been *"* nrst. The arguments, he repeated, were very able, but there had been something not quito sat-fac-ory. There had been a shrinking from what appeared to be the main point. He wanted to know what was the liwnpon the subject. Tliey were now called upon to iake a most serious step. If they went into committee, and agreed to the proposal of his noble and learned friend, theywould enterupon a course the end of whicii he could not see, and the House would pledge itself to a line of action from which it could not retreat with honour nor unscathed. (Hear, hear.) He felt for the honour of the House, for the integntyof its decisions, for the very safety of the constitution. (Hear, hear.) Their lordships' proceedings now -hr-Iengcd universal observation. They could not confine the question within that house. If they went into committee, they would engage in a contest in which they must cither persevere, or retreat in a manner which he did not liko to contemplate. He was sure his noble and learned friend (Lyndhurst) would forgive him for saying that they were completely shifting their ground. They had begun with one tiling, and wero now engaged in arguing a very different thing. At first the question was nothing but the legality or illegality of the grant. Such was the question as it was statcd in various parts of the country that was about to bo raised even before the session. The very day on which the House met he found in the lobby a numter of persons, members ofthe other House and others, who said that the only question was the legality or illegality of the grant, and, if legal, the whole dispute would end at once. When his noble, and learned friend commenced this discussion, with the wisdom that became him he abstained from "rappling with that qnestion-namely, what was the law of the land upon the subject ? Ho said distinctly, the law of the land, for he was not at that moment speaking of the law of Parliament. Hisnoble and learned friendhovered upon, the brink of the subject, but without entering boldly into it, and, finally, he altered the question and turned it mto one concerning the practico of Parliament. But another noble and learned lord (St. Leonard's), not acting with the same reserve, at once rushed into tho question of legality or illegality, and without hesitation stated ihat the measure was illegal, and upon that ground he was prepared to decide the question. That being the first ground on which the case was put, he (LordGlenelg) wished tp ask why they had departed from it ? Why had the question of legality been abandoned, and the case reduced to one of expediency, policy, and constitutional law? He was anxious to know what was the law of the land upon the subject ; but the noble lord evaded that question; he banished his original argument, and suddenly introduced the question of expediency. But he did not want to be told what was expedient. He was uninformed as to the state of ihe law; he confessed him-;elf so. He wished to know how to act in a greatf crisis; and therefore it was thai he cornplamed of his noble and learned friend not giving him that information which would enable them to decide legally. It seemed to him thai the report returned by the committee was noi an answer to the question referred to ihem. The Earl of DERBY.-I rise to order. The coinmittee have not yet come to any repori. Their lordships were about fo go into conimittee for the purpose of con-odering their report, and, when the report was agreed to in committee and was laid before the House, their lordships could discuss it. Xord GLENELG.-Surely, I may refer to the paper on the iable ? The Earl of DERBY.-Not as the repori of the committee. Lord GLENELG.-Not the report of the committee . Why, it has been before us for several days. The Earl of DERBY.-It has not been agreed to. Lord GLENELG said, that the report of tte committee, which their lordships would be called upon that night to sanction, supcosing it came before them, told them what they were to do. They were asked to examine and consider the letters patent creating Sir James Parke a baron for life, and to report thereon. Those words were of a very wide and general character. Well, what was proposed to be the answer? Why, that ihe committee, havmg examined the letters patent purporting to create Sir J. Parke a baron for life, report that neither those letters patent nor the writ of rsummons annexed to them entitled the grantee to sit and *oi*mthat house. Now, thatanswerdidnotat all correspond with tte question. If the instruction to the committee had fceen that thev should report to the House whetherthe grant was legal or noir, then the report would have been * direct -answer. He begged to state this view ofthe case in con_nna_on of what he conceived to be the exact nature of ihe argument as it had been hitherto conducted. Tlie case had been argued by the Iawlords as a question of authority. Were they to let the discussion rest upon authority alone ? J"hey had the legal authorities in that house, and he confessed that, after what he had heard from those noble and learned lords he didnot feel certain that authority alone could with confidence be relied upon. But if they were to ixs led by authority he must consider what those authorities were, and the weight to which ihey wero justly entitled. Now, ho found that those authorities considerably differed among themselves. He alluded to this fact with a view to show how cautions and careful they ought to bc in coming to a decisionwhentheyfound thatihehest and ablest men differed from one another. Neither ought the decision of their lordships to be impugned because it might be shown to be opposed to some legal authority. But he wished to know on which side the greatest weight of authority was to be found. It seemed to him that the opinions of the most eminent authorities were pretty equally balanced. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack (Lord Campfcell) had argued thc case on either side in a very powerful speech. (Alaugh.) No doubt the authority of the noble and learned lord who commenced this discussion (Lyndturst)was of the highest kind; but he (Lord Glenelg) fcegsed to say-not with any disparagement to the authority of that noble and learned lord-that there was an authority connected with this v..-y subject to which he was surprised that no reference had bcen made in the couise of the debate. He had a right to assume thai that authority, of LordWensleydale, was in favour of the legality of the grant. Did any man believe that thai learned person,with his talent, experience, and honourable feeling, would have consented to come to their lordships' House and assume his seat by virtue of a grant from the Crown, if hehadnotbeendeeplyconvinced ,that the grani was altogether legal? (Hear, hear.) Lt, ?would Ije in insult andsa injury to that learned person to entertain a-moment's doubt on the subject. Therefore, however nreat might be tho legal authority of the noble and learned lord (Lyndhurst), he felt that he was not doing V**.- a.°ll *n*1 learned lord any disparagement or injustice if ho ventured to quote in opposition to his opinion' the authority pf Lord Wensleydale. (Hear.hear.) Hehad -3. f^-t*? . to -tis noWe *nd learned friend (Lord Camp* li ^"°|1*vlB-> wi * former occasion, admitted tho power ot the Crown to grant a peerage for life, had since made an able »peech against its legality; his noble and learned friend might, therefore, be very fairly allowed to pair off with himself on the subject. JCheers and laughter.) And the opinion of the anthor of The Live* of theLord Chief Justices might bo put against the opinion of the Lord CMef Justice. (Hew, hear.) Bi-, speakingof authority, he could not bui observe ihat it'had always been considered a habit among lawyers to look with veneration and almost with idolatry to the great men who had been -their predecessors in the law; and the names of Coke, Selden, Dugdale, and Blackstone were held in high esteem by all who succeeded them; and yet it was remarrkable that on the preaent occasion those authorities werenolongerheld in respect. And yet it was npon tho authority of such inen tliat tins country had depended for ages past. It was upon the authority of those great men-the supporters of British freedom-that British law had been built. (Cheeis.) He did, therefore, feeldeeply, as every Englishman inust feel, when he found tho authority of those men set at nought and discarded by those who professed to be anxious to uphold the privileges and honours of their lordships' House. If theirlordships wero to follow the guidance of thegreat legal authorities in this house, he wanted to know where it would lead them to ? Let them consider that this was not amore party question. (Hear, hear.) They were called upon to-night to pronounce a decision affecting the prerogative of the Crown which had never upto tms hour been disputed. The House of Lords, interwoven, as it was with the monarchy-tho proud champions of the monarchy-the guardians e>f the Crown-whose ancestors had, with chivalrous daring, defended the Royal prerogative-were now, for the first time, endeavouring to assail that prerogative. They should beware how they embarked upon such a course, and how, by acceding to the motion of the noble and learned lord opposite, they entered upon a contest with the Crown. Let them pause for a moment hefore thus committing ihemselves; let them give themselves breathing time, and in the] meanwhile resort to their legitimate councillois to know what the law of the land really was on the subject. It might bo that the kiw was adverse to this exercise of the prerogative; and if such were the case, however much they might lament it, their lorelships would bo compelled to bow to what was pronounced to be the law. Clearly, howover, this step on tho part of the Crown was either legal or illegal; the question respecting the privileges of ParUament was a.subsidiary one, and it was with regard to the main question of law that their lordships required a dofinite answer. His noble and learned friend opposite had referred to tho Bill of Rights and to its bearing upon the subject under disensicn. He (lord Glenelg) therefore wanted to know, as a point of law, the precise effect which the Revolution of 16SS nad upon tho prerogatives ofthe Crown. Again, their lordships wero told that 400 years had elapsed since tho exercise of this prerogative, which had, therefore, fallen into desuetude, and become extinguished. This was, he thought, a sentiment curious to the ears of Englishmen. (Hear.) .According to the law of England, was there any penod of time which barred the prerogative of the Crown? Such an objection, comingfrom this House, seemed to him peculiarly ungracefuL What was the law recognized by this House and by the nation respecting the operation ofthe lapse of years on the claims of peers? Why, by the law of the land no length of time could bar a peer from asserting nis privileges in this house; and how, then, could their lordships, so jealous of their own privileges, go out of their way to contend that laree of years should bar tho prerogative of tho Crown? Such a course was unworthy of the House of Peers, unworthy of thoso who claimed to be the guardians and protectors of the Crown, but who now came forward to limit its prerogative, and to strike from it part of its ancient splendour. According to the doctrine he had alluded to, the Crown was barred by time, but the peers were not so barred. Now, why should not both occupy the sarnei position ? Hc himself would not venture tc offer an opinion on such a point, but he did desire to know what the law of tho land was on the subject. He could not but think that their lordships were not very well aware of the difficulty in which they were placed, for, to his mind, their House appeared to be placed in a false position in which they ought never to have found themselves. Ho had had no share in such a result, hut ho felt the deepest regret that anything like a contest should take place between the House of Lords and the Crown. In his opmion, tho prerogative of the Crown, the privileges of Parliament, and the liberties of the people were so much involved with each other that to shake the one would be to endanger tho remainder. He repeated that ho much regretted that the House of Lords should be placed in anything like antagonism tothe Crown; but, whatever mightbe the end of the contest, he wished io urge upon their lordships not to come to a decision upon the subject until they were inf onned what was the law of England with regard to it, and not deliberately, without that information, to adopt a course which would -Eterwards be irreparable. (Hear, hear.) - Lord CAMPBELL entertained the most sincere respect for his noble friend who had just addressed their lordships, but he felt bound to complain of ths course which he had adopted on the present occasion. He did not complain of the motion of hisnoble friend, butratherof the manner in which he had brought it forward, for he had taken the opportunity of making a speech which would have been much more appropriate when iheir lordships were considering in committee the resolution of his noble and learned friend; and, to his great astonishment, his noble friend had sat down without even telling their lordships what the questions were which he had risen to propose should be put to the judges. It became, therefore, his duty to state to their lordships what those questions were it was proposed io ask ihe judges. Tho questions were,-Is it in the power of the Crown to create by patent the dignity of a baron of the united kingdom forlife? And, What rights and privileges does such a grant confer? Now, his noble friend had not brought forward a single argument to show that those questions were questions which could properly be submitted to the judges. The judges were the constitutional advisers of their lordships' House upon matters which fell within their cognizance, and upon such matters they could be consulted; but it was the duty of his noble friend to show that those questions came within that category. Now, upon subjects like the present, the judges were not, in his opinion, the constitutional advisers of the House. The question was a question of privilege which should be dealt with by their lordships themselves. (Hear.hear.) He should not follow the example of his noble friend by entering into the merits of the question, or in adducing any argument with regard io the resolution of his noble and learned friend opposite which would be proposed in committee, but there was one topic which he could not refrain from noticing which had been adverted to by his noblo friend. His noble friend had suggested that their lordships should not take notice of this question, because, by doing so, they might be brought into antagonism with the Crown. Now, he had the greatest possible respect for the prerogative of the Crown properly exercised, but that prerogative might be exceeded ; and if it were, then it became the duty of those who respected the prerogative of the Crown to ask for explanations on the subject. All tae arguments which had been adduced by his noble friend would apply to a patent for a term of years or for a single night, or at the pleasure of the Crown; but if grants of such peerages were conferred, were their lordships' bound to admit that such giants conferred upon the recipients of them the right to sit and vote in Parliament» The exercise of the prerogative of the Crown might be watched, and ought to be watched, and there wasa tribunal appointed to decide whether the Crown exceeded its prerogative in matters referring to the creation of peers, a tribunal recognized by the constitution ofthe ir-ountry, and that tribunal was composed of Ihefr lorikhips themselves. (Hear.hear.) Now, with regard to the first question which it was proposed should be submitted to the nidges, was thata fittingejuestion fo submit to the judges ? Why, it was a question to which there could be but one answer. There was not the slightest doubt that the Crown could create a peer for life, or for a term of years, or for the life of another, or during will, or could create any new dignity and confer it upon anyone it pleased. The question which their lordships would have to decide would be whether a life peerage conferred the right of attmgandvotinginPar__ment,anditceitainlyw_snotneces- sarytoassembleallthejudgestoansweraquestionuponwhich no donbt existed. The second question was, what were the pnvdeges conferred by a peerage for life ? It was not proposed thai there should, be any aigument at bar to assist the judges, but they were to be asked to sit down and write a treatise upon the privileges of a peer for life. Now he had that moniing looked into Blackstone, and he found that one of the privileges of a baron was thai in comm" to Parliament, he might in passing through any of the King's forests kill a deer, andif the keeper were not there he was to blow his horn, and the question midit arise whether apeer for life would be entitled to a similar privilege. ("Hear, hear," and alaugh.) Questions relating to other pnvileges would arise, and, m fact the judges would have to write a treatise upon all the privileges of a peer which would of necessity be a somewhat voluminous publication. He had the utmost respect and reverence for his learned brethren on the bench, who, he believed, dischaiged their duty in a manner worthy of the highest praise when that duty feE within the limits of their own legitimate functions, but he did not wish to see them engaged upon such a iask as it was now proposed to allot to them. They might easily require, not until the end of the session merely, but until the meeting of another Parliament, before giving an answer tothat question. The learned judges were treated rather sharply in the Bridgewater case for giving therr opimon a little hastily, and bethought theyonght not to be allowed a less period than seven long years for considering this question. (A laugh.) But then _amo tho question, whethera patent from the Crown toa baron for his hfe gave him a right to sit in that house. Ho should not try toreconcile-which he might easily do-the anthorities on &is aubjeet which his noble friend had a little perverted. But hethought it clear that this was a question ofpri?vdege which that House ought to determine for itself, and whichtheju^eswo*_dref_-togiveanopi-ionnpon.(C-ieer8.) Certainly, if the learned judges regarded what-thei predecessors had done they would refuse to answer the question* which his noble fnend proposed to put to them, and would say it was for their lordships to say whethei-the learned baron ought to sit in that house or not. (Hear, hear.)

Lord CAMPBELL.-The question was whether the Speaker of the Houso of Commons could be taken in execution when the House was in committee. (A kvugh.) He admitted that it was not a question for the admission of a peer, for now for the first tame a demand for the; admission of a peer was made, when there was good ground for believing that the patent was in excess of theprerogative. .(Hear.) In la-boy's case, in the reign of Henry v"TTT the judges weie consulted as to ihe claim of tho husband of apeeressinherown right to be summoned inher right. They answered"That the common law dealeth little wiih titles and customs of chivalry, but such questions had always been decided before the constables and marshals of England." The LORD CHANCELLOR.-Who put that question to ihem? ' Xord CAMPBELL.-The King. ("Hear, hear," from the Loud Chancellor.) . Xord Coke in his Inslitules said,- " And as every court of justice hath laws and customs for its direction, some by the common law, some by particular laws and customs, so the High Court of Parliament suis propriis legibus ct consuetudinibus subsistat. It is lex et consuetudo Parliamenti that all weighty matters in any Parliament moved concerning tho peers of the realm or Commons in Parliament assembled ought to be determined, adjudged, and ciiscussed by the course of the Parliament, aud not by the civil law, nor yet bythe common laws of this realm.. And thisisthe reason that judges ought not to give any. opinion ofa matterof Parliament, because it is not tobe decided by the common laws, but secundum legem etconsuef K-tnem. Poriiamcntt, and so tho judges in divers Parliaments have confessed." These authorities would prove to their lordships that it was contrary to the invariable usages and constitutional practice of the country for the judges to be consulted upon questions of Parliamentary privilege. Justice Blackstone approved "The practice of the judges in refusing to give any opimon uponthe law of Parliament, with which they aro not supposed to bo conversant." Chief Justice Do Grey said," Courts of justice haveno cognizance of tho acts of tho Houses of ^Parliament, because thoy belong ad aliud cxamen," Had ho noi now said enough to showthat theso questions ought not tobe given to the judges, and that their lordships ought to proceed upon the report of the Committee of Privileges, and determine the question for themselves? (Hear.) Several of the judges had set off fortheir circuits, and the otters would very shortly he dispersed all over the countiy. With eveiy respect for Xord Wensleydale, he doubted whether he had properly considered this business, or that ho could be said to have given a legal opinion upon it. (A laugh.) Their loidships had been told that the AttorneyGeneral and the Solicitor-General were tho constitutional advisers of the Crown. But the noble andlearned lord upon the woolsack had admitted that he had consulted neither the Attorney nor the Solicitor General before this patent had issued. Lord Wensleydalewashisprivate friend, and was highly honoured and beloved. In what situation was Lord Wensleydale now? In the earlier discussions on this subject noble lords on the Ministerial bench were eager for despatch -"Let there be no delay," they said, and they opposed a motion for postponing jvroceedings by a single day. At present iheir lordships did not know whether Lord'Wesleydale was apeer or not-whether he had a right to sit in that house, or whether he was eligible to sit in the House of Commons. Such a situation was a little unfair to him. He trusted their lordships would be of opinion that this motion ought to be negatived, and that their lordships ought to proceed to the decision of this question. (Cheers.) The LORD CHANCELLOR.-I agree withmy noble and learned friend in thinking that we are in a difficulty, because the judges, or the greater part of them, ivill shortly leavo town for the assizes; but, unless I greatly deceive myself, the couise into which your lordships are, you will pormit mo to say, recklessly hurrying is fraught with so much danger that, in spite of the inconvenience of delay, I call upon your lordships to consider whether you will como to a decision on this subject without having taken the best means of ascertaining the legality or illegality of the courso to be takenThe ejuestion is not one merely of legality or illegality. Suppose it wero established to be to aS intents and purposes legal. I am quite prepared to admit that thoso who have advised it maystillhe obnoxious to the censure of your lordships. (Hear, hear.) But before we stir a step in a matter so very important, surely the country will expect that.we shonld take means to ascertain correctly what the law is, and what are the rights involved in conferring such a patent, (Hear, hear.) The noble and learned lord commenced with some amusing surmises as to what would be the craestions put to tho judges, such as what wonld bo the general nature of the privileges conferred by such a patent -a question which my noble and learned friend thought would be so vague as to bo utterly useless. But the questions put to the judges were often framed in this general way. I remember that, when I was one of tho judges, a question was referred to them with reference to the Canadian reserves. They were asked whether any body of Protestant clergy, other than Episcopalian, was entitled to any share in those reserves; but the judges saw that to answer the question exhaustively would be an endless proceeding, as they would have to decide what bodies were or were not included. They therefore framed an answer in the best way they could, to enable the House to como to a conect conclusion on the main question at issue-viz., whether other bodies besides Episcopalians were included. I believe the -mo course would be followed in this instance. The judges would answer in the main what they considered to be the privileges conferred by the patent now nnder consideration. (Hear, hear.) My noble and learned friend scouts the notion of asking the judges whether the proceeding that has been taken is legal or not, because he says no one has any doubt upon the question. But surely that was not the opimon of the noble and learned lord who first intiroduced this subjectto the House, or he would not have taken the course he then did. It appears to me, then, that this is an afterthought of my noble and learned friend. (Hear. hear.) The question really before us is, what rights and privileges does such a patent confer; and the object now in view is to guide your lordships to a safe and correct conclusion regarding it, so that we may be able to ascertain whether such a grant does or does not entitle the holder of it to sit and perform service in this house. It has been suggested that this is a matter in which tho learned judges cannot give an opinion; but that this isa fallacy I think I shall be able to show to all your lordships, and certainly to thosewho are familiar with legal subjects. Ifthejudces were to state that a person in whose favour such a grant had been issued had no right, for example, to be tried by his peers in this house-that ho had no nght to be privileged from arrest-then tliat would lead strongly to the opinion that hehad no right to sit heroin virtue of the writ of summons; but if, on the contraiy, ttey decided that he had such rights, the inference would be that he was entitled to take his seat in the house. (Hear.) I wili, however, stato a mode by which, with all deference to the learned judges, I would compel them to decide whether such a patent as ihe present entitles the holder of it to a seat in this house. In order to show how ihis could be done, I will cite a case which, on account of its very extravagance, may perhaps excite a smile. Hy the statute of the 24th of George HL, chap. 26, it is provided that if any member of Parliament during tho recess becomes a peer, and if two members of the House of Commons certify tothe Speaker that fact, he is authorized and required within a certain time to issue a precept to the Clerk of the Crown for a new writ. Now, suppose I put it as a question tothe judges, that A B, who was a member ofthe House of Commons, had received a writ to sit in the Upper House, and that this having been certified to the Speaker ofthe House of Commons he had wilfully refused to issue a precept to the Clerk ofthe Crown-whether in so doing he was guilty of. a misdemeanour, and ought to be convicted accordingly; is it not clear thatthe answer of the judges would virtually settle the question whether the Royal writ did or did not constitute him a peer and entitle him to sit in this House? (Hear.) If ihe patent turns him out of the House of Commons, then it followsthat it would give him a right to a seat in this house, and by the mode in which the question is put you observe that the judges would be compelled to answer "Ay," or. "No." I should, however, be perfectly satisfied with the opinions of the judges being given in the more obvious way of considering all the matters connected with the subject, so that we might have no elifficulty whatever in coming to a sound conclusion regarding it. (Hear, hear.) I shall now come to the authorities cited by my noble and leamedfriend. The first case was one in which the judges declined to give an answer on the Iex et consuetudo Parliamenti ; hut this is not a question of that kind; it is a question of lex coronal. (Hear, hear.) Has the Crown a right to command the services of one of the judges in this house ? (Hear, hear.) The next case related to a question put by the Crown to ihe judges regarding a writ of summons. This questionwasputby Henry VEL, and I do not wonder that the judges were anxions to say. nothing on the subject. (Laughter.) , This reply accordingly was, that such questions ought to be_etermined by the Lord Marescha.. Lord Coke very properly says that questions touching the lex tt consudvxlo iParliamenti arc questions which the judges are not to answer; that this is noi a matter within therr province; that the question they would here be called upon to answer is a ejuestion affecting, notthe law and custom of Parliament, hut thelaw ofthe lana. (Hear, hear.) On these gronnds I trust ihe Houae will agree to the motion of my noble friend, and show to the country, what otherwise it will not believe, that your lordships are anxious to ascertain what the law on the subject really is. (Hear.hear.) Mylords, I may be wrong m thinking that this case is as important as I deemittobe, but if the motion of my noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) is carried in the committee, I protest to your lordships tliat I believe it will be the most illegal, unprecedented, and indefensible innovation on the rights of another branch of the constitution thai hss ever occ-rred. (Hear, hear.) It will be a proceeding for wiiich. there is no precedent, and for wiiich there is no principle. My noble and learned friend has given notice that he will propose to your lordships in committee not to receive in this house one of Her Majesty's subjects who. may present himself at the bar witha writ from Her Majesty commanding hi- to Come here and render his service. I trust, before your lordships como to a conclusion that you will consider the whole -earings of this question, and that yon will, in the first place, agree to the motion ofniy noble friend, by which you will be enabled to obtain Ihe opinion of tie learned judges. (Hear, hear.) .." The Earl of WINC__XS_A said that, although the right might have been exercised by the Tudors and Stuarts, it was surrendered at the glorious Kovolutiorfof 1683, and no "precedent could be cited showing its exercise by the Sovereigh' sihee that period. If they destroyed the hereditary character of their lordship"' house by allowing this privilege to be exercised bythe Minister ofthe Crown, what security would they have that there would noi he, jn after days, a Sove-' reign not regarding tho affections and institutions ofthe country, as did her present gracious Majesty-a female Sovereign, perhaps, sitting on the throne under the direction and guidance and burdened with the connexion of a foreign prince (little imbued with the liberty, spirit, and practice of tho Bntish- constitution), who would aim a blow at that constitution and destroy the independence of theHouse of Peers? . ' Xord BROUGHAM deolined altogether following the noble lord who had just sat down, or the noble lord who had made this motion, into the question of legality, constitutional nature, or expediency involved in this matter." The question before their lordships was of a very limited naturewhether they would or would not proceed further by going into a <->mmittep of Privileges and reporting on the -abject referredto tho committee, without hearing the judges, or first take tho advice of thoso le-irned counsellors? With' respect to his noble friend (theLord ChanceUor), there was ona word used by him more than once, and which he was rather. surprised to find uttered by his noble friend on this occasion, in connexion with the unhappy predicament into which they had been, not to say drawn, but .rather driven, and that was the word "reckless." (Hear, hear.) Of all the words-iall the dictidriaries of the Saxon tongue'which he might expect to find in the mouth of any of the present advisers of the Crown, that word " reckless" was ihe last. (Cheers.) His noble and learned friend as well as ljis noble friend (the Chief Justiee) had reduced the: question to this-whether the lex el consuutudo Parliamenti were involvedin the creation of life peerages; and whether they could frame the questions in such a manner as to compel the judges to answer asto pointsnpon which tho judges on former occasions had wisely and consistently declined to reply ? The question for therr lordships, in his view, was short, simple, and practical-whetiier they, could get an answer from the learned judges ?- By the learned judges, he assumed, was meant the 14 judges, exclusive of the one who remained in town during the year ; and the greater part of them had either left town orwereonthe point of leaving it. Wero they to ask the judges for an opinion without giving them time to consider? .The.'point was not like one of those ordinary matters in the practice of the courts, which 24 hours' consideration would enable any judge to answer satisfactorily. It wasa question full of difficulty. It was a question upon which, as they knew, there had been great difference of opinion among lawyers in that houso and ont of that house. Under those circumstances, were they to administer intenrogatories tb tho learned judges, and call upon them within 24 or 48 hours to return an answer. Practically speaking, they could not obtain an answer, however much his noble fnend1 might desiderate it, for the reasons which, he had given, which, he must say, were very few, and tllosefew, he thought, veryindifferent. (Cheers anda laugh.) Thejudges'womdsay, this was not an ordinary matter, and they wanted a few months for consideration ; it was a matter which did not press, but might stand over until noxt session. That would be the inevitable consequence of accepting the motion of the noble earl and putting questions to the judges. (Hear.) He was a littlo astonished to hear complaints of the rapid, wilful, and inconsiderate haste of the noble and learned lord (Lyndhurst), in proposing to have a decision on this great and important constitutional question. The noble earl (Glenelg) complained of their wishing to go on without consulting the judges, and said they could not take too much precaution against falling into error, and his noble and learnc.; friend on the woolsack entered thoroughly into the "same viewdeprecating hasty proceedings, and expressing himself anxious for further inquiry and fuller investigation. Then it might be supposed thoso two noblo peers, who considered a little delay did not signify compared with the evils of a hasty and erroneous judgment, being arrived at, voted the other night for crning into ei Committeo of Privileges; but, if ho was not misi firmed, though ho could hardly believe it, both vc'ed f-_:aiiist proceeding further in a Committee of Privileges-one thought it better to proceed in anotherwri}-, and the other was for at once rejecting the motion for inquiry without further consideration. (Hear, hear.) Thoy would liave decided without inquiry, and now, after the llonschsd determined to inquire,had actually examined the subject, and were about to go into committee in orderto complete tho inquiiy, the noble lords got up and said, "We cannot goon with it; the best thiug is delay to incjuire into and investigate the subject; ii is too important to be speedily or rapidly settled." (Hear, hear.) He would not enter at length into the argument which had been used that this was not a question of privilege, but a question of tho prerogative of the Crov. _. It was true it was a question of prerogative, but it was cf the prerogative trenching upon or infringing Jhe privileges of the House, which the Honse not only could consider, out mnst consider. (Hear.) According to tho argument of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, the Crown, err. mero molu, without writ or patent, could send down any person to tiiat house, and if their lordships refused to allow him to take his seat, producing no authority, it would be a question, not of privilege, but of the prerogative of tho Crown, and then noble lords advised the House not to rush into collision with the Crown. Ho (Lord Brougham) was quite surprised to heaT such arguments from any lawyer, especially from a Whig lawyer. ("Hear," and a laugh.) No person could entertain greater respect for tho judges than he did; no one was more anxious to have the benefit of their assistance; but thcro were difficulties in the way of calling upon them in the present instance, and tho peremptory refusal of Xord Wensleydale to appear by counsel had aggravated thoso difficulties, for the judges would be asked to_ecide without hearing the case argued- (Hear.) The judges could not be invited to that house to listen to the arguments of noble lords upon which their opinions were to be taken. He did not deny the competency of the House to call in the judges, but he contended that to do so in the present instance would be most inconvonicut, and Hiey in-o-Id Tbo rrcq-Tred to give an opinion without having the ordinary benefit of hear-ig the case argued by counsel. Thero were many objections to the motion" of the noble baron, but he had only referred toone or twoin addition to those mentioned by the noble chief justice ; but they quite justified him in opposing the proposal which was now madEarl GRANVILLE.-I hope your lordships will not be alarmed by the books before me, nor fear that I am about to fa-oubleyou at any greai length. I can assure your lordships I shall confine myself exclusively to tho point before tho House, although I must say I never heard a more unjust charge than was made by tho noble and learned lord who has just sat down against the noble baron who made this motion as to having wandered from tho point. I really think it is too much to expect, in discussing a matter of ihis land, that my noble friend should wholly ignore and put out of sight the point to which tho committee was about arriving. He had an undoubted right to refer to a notice upon your lordship, minutes. The noble and learned lord also said that the four law lords were agreed in opinion against the opinion of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack. I will go further than the I noble baron (Glenelg), and say that upon the question of the legality of Lord Wensleydale's patent there aro great inconsistencies in the opinions of the ' noble lords. I agree that the nohle and learned baron opposite (Lord Lyndhurst) has been consistent; he has never given any opinion npon the point. My noble and learned friend carefully abstained from saying anything uponit, and I am not surprised that he should have done so, for he acted in a judicial character only last year in a case of life peerage-a Scotch peerage-and the noble and learned lord on that occasion put this question to the counsel, " It was usual formerly to grant life peerages in England; is it so in Scotland?' Now, it would havebeen inreconcileable with the cliaracter of the noble and learned lord for consistency if he had got up now and said it was perfectly illegal. The noble and learned lord who just addressed us has expressed an inclination to believe that the patent is strictly legal As to my other noble and learned fnend, he stated in his place as a peer, in opposition to another pldn which had been proposed, that it was within the prerogative of the Crown to grantlife peerages. The noble and learned lord also in that delightful book which hasbeen already quotedthe Lives of the Chancellors-in which he gives a qnalified approval as to the expediency in some cases of granting such peerages, has given his undoubted opinion that such is within the prerogative of the Crown. (Hear, hear.) I think I have made out a caso to show thai implicit reliance cannot be placed upon the opinions of noble and learned lords, and when they come to this house with a violent and nnusual resolution we must be guided upon the point of legality or -legality hy the opinions which they have already given. The noble and learned lord (Brougham) has expressed his surprise at the course which has been taken npon going, into committee. I must say I think it was a most undesirable step to take at all, and I ownj I experienced some slight consolation for the part we have taken when 1 found quite casor-ly this morning a protest in-ie Townsend case, signed by Lord Cottenham and other peers now in the house. The first sentence of that protest is, "Because the bfll is an invasion of the prerogative of ihe Crowd and the right of thesubject-of theprerogative of thoCreiwn as adjudicating npon the titles of peers without reference fromthe C-own, or leave given for that purpose." , . Lord CAMPBELL.-That was a question of legitimacy. Earl GRANVILLE.-I read this to showthat Lord Cottenham objected to this particullar bill, which must havo received the sanction of the House of Commons, and would have tobe assented to by the Sovereign before passing-that it affected the power of tho Crown, no reference by the Crown having been made or leave given. .The only conclusion I can draw is: that that noble and learned lord would have objected to Our resolving ourselves into a Committee of Privileges withoutthe leave of a -reference from theCrown. I hope my noble and learned friend the Chief Justice will believe that in appealing from himself I do so to bringthe weight of his learning and knowledge to bear npon the case I offer to your lordships; butin a'case heard in a court of law the noble lord, referring to the: Banbury oase in which there was a charge of murder, and Lord Banbury claimed to be tried by his peers. "That vie*,", saidthenoble and;learned lord-was held to be bad, and properly so. coram non judice,-ihey not having had the case referred to themby the Crown, witho-twhich they hadno'jurisdiction." These are some consolations for our objections -to the committee. But I do feel strongly that bygones should be bygones, and, oncebeing ih committee, we musi all unite to try and come out as creditably as possible. An objection has also: been inade by my noble Mend (Lord Campbell) that precedents are against the motion of my noble friend. I must say, the, precedents quoted by him were demolished bytho noble and learned lord on' the woolsack! andtho noble and learned lord who followed him did .not attempt any rejoinder.- I think there are precedents the other way. In - Cruise's tBoc* of Dignities I find these cases :- Mriongville>in 1640"claimedthebaronyof Grey deRuthyn That case was refeired to the Houseof LordB, and a question was put to the judges with respeot to the _ucce__6n. Another -'case he ? might mention is the Clifton case, ih which tho judges, on being consulted, declared that the said *_j°a>.fcv?r1^"6 of &"> Mid writ.of si_nnio_g, and his attinginParliamentiwcordingly,' was?»peer and Ibsroncf this kmgdom, and his blood thereby ennobled; secondly that his said honour descended from him to'Catherine, his sole daughter and heir, and successively after several descents to the petitioner as lineal heir oftho said Lord Clifton ; thirdly, that therefore the petitioner was well entitled to the said dignity. A third; case is the barony of Fitzwalter, in 1608, when the two chief justices and Chief Baron Hall were consulted, and atn-eed that" the half blood was no impediment to the descent of a dignity to an heir general,''with which opinion the King, who was present, Being satisfied, Mr.1 Mildmay got the barony. These are .11 cases in point to prove that the judges have been consulted npon questions of this . kind. Reference has also been made to a bill which enabled King William to delegate certain powers to his Queen during his absence abroad. Tinsi was referred to the judges, and Chief Justice Holt decided that, without an act of Parliament, ihe Sovereign couldnot exercise'such powers. Surely, my lords, this affords another reason why your lordships should refer this msAter to the judges. - To my great astonishment, ihe noble and learned lord .stated that, if your lordships were to call uj>on the judges to advise you upon the qnestion, they could not do so, because they would be deprived of the assistance of counsel; and because, in MNaghten's case, one of the judges objected to -the opinions of judges, being asked without their having an opportunity of hearing counsel. But that objection was overruled by every one of the remaining judges %? and Lord Broughani, Lord Campbell, Lord Cottenham, Lord Wynford, and tiie Lord Chancellor, laid it down that the JHouse ArT-VCHP harl AftTiTlHATih^nJ Mi.lti l*w \w_.^.a. A\. -. -----_.___- ._ _ _. t H ___ delay wmen would be occasioned by referring the matter to the judges,. and, in doing so, I thonght he proved more than was necessaiy for his case. He referredto the month of February, -rid to the terms and vacations' with which the noblo and' learned lord is much mere conversant than I am, and he endeavoured to show that it was impossible to get the opimon of the judges during the ^session. Surely it is idle to urge such an argument as a bar to your lordships' puttting, any question to . the judges. When the noble and; learned lord says that it ought to take the judges seven years to discuss the question, it is due to the noble and learned lord tosuppose that he sppko it humourously. But, my lords, I do think that if we are able in seven days to arrive at an opinion upon the matter, notwithstanding the opinions of nobleand learned lords are inconsistent with one another, and,, in some instances, even inconsktent with themselves__ if within that jieriod we are expected to dispose of so great a question of jurisdiction -and prerogative, surely the judges might reasonably be expected to bo able to come to a decision within the period of tho session. Thenoble and learned lord has said that Hcr Majesty's Govemment, inthe first instance, wanted to have the question' decided without going into committee at all, andi that we are, therefore, very inconsistent in wishing to interpose any delay. But I think, my lords, the course wo aro pursuing is perfectly justifiable. We ourselves entertain no doubt about the legality of the patent and of the writ i_ued by tho Queen. But when your lordships overrule us, and bring us into a committee, and when you propose to adopt a courso which is utterly unusual and altogether without precedent, I do not think you have any right to turn npon us and accuse us of causing delay when we show a desire tiiat your lordships should seriously deliberate uponthe question thus broughtbefore you, and use every means in your power to come to a satisfactoiy arrangement. My lords, are there no points raised of importance? The noM and learned lord saysthat thefirstqucsfion proposed to be asked the judges was useless, because he could assure your lord"iips that no donbt exists as to the Queen having the power to make a peer by patent for life. But, as the noblo imd leamedlord has on another occasion expressed a different opinion, it is possible that he may reconsider the more recent opinion he has pronounced, and at some future time give. an opinion diametrically opposite. Thereforolshouldlike to have the opinion my noblo and learned friend has this evening expressed confirmed by tho learned judges of the land. This, to me- my lords, appears to be a point of great importance;'for, although the Queen has the power to create a peer for life, yet it may be argued and indeed decided in the couise of this session that such a dignity does not confer a right to sit in this house. Yet, my lords, in a report drawn np by that great lawyer, Lord JKedesdale, it is stated that" By such means the King hoped to obtain a majority in theHouseof Connnons. The Upper House would then be at his mercy. He had undoubtedly, by law, the power of creating peers without limit; and this power ho was fully determined to use. He did not wish-and, indeed, no Sovereign can wish-to make the highest honour which is in the gift of the Crown worthless. He cherished the hope that, by calling np some heirs apparent to the assembly in which they must ultiniately sit, and by conferring English titles on some Scotch and Irish lords, he might he able to securer a majority without ennobling new men in such numbers as tobring ridicule on the coronet and the ermine. But there was no extremity to which he was not prepared to go in case of necessity. When in a laige company an opinion "was expressed that that the peeis would prove inbactable, 'Oh, silly,' cried Sunderland, "ruining to Churchill; * your troop of Guards shall be called up to tho House of Lords.'" Hthe judges shonld confirm this opinion, wo should then have not only their judgment, but the opinions of Lord Redesdale and my noble and learned friend; so that tho case would appearto be absolutely decided. I will refer your lordships to a case which I met with very providentially. It was first brought to notice by the noble aud learned lord who began this debate, and nothing can be morefairthan to show what Was the residt ofit. The peers, having refused to tako the advice of the judges, and having decided quite contrary to the law, were e-bliged 17 years after to call in the assistance of the judges, and they then gave quite a different decision. I hold in my hand a book of some authority. I am going to quote Mr. Hargrave-a passage this time really written by him (hear, hear), -nd not a note which he never -r-_- -and never saw. It refers to the case of Sir Charles Knollys, who claim-id the Biandon peerage. Mr. Hargrave says, "Though tMs claim was finally rejected, yetitappears that a great number of peers (20 of them) protested against the decision. Such a cu-urnst-nco goco far to induce the great probability that had it not been refused to hear the judges the claimant would have had their opimon both on the facts and the law of the case in his favour." My lords, I now come to another Siestion. Icertainlydo not hold the doctrine that thi offise isse rvilely to support the prerogative of theCrown in whatever way that prerogative may be exercised; but I do say that when you are dealing with a prero gative of the Crown in a manner that goes to the very root of that prerogative, and when I consider that in the exercise of your own privileges in questioning that prerogative yon are taking an unprecedented and _a*_st-1 step, I think that, although the aet itself may be right, and may be recroired by the necessity of the case, yet it is decent with regard to the Crown, it is respectful to ihe other honse of Parliament, and it is showing due consideration to the feelings of the country, that, before corning to so strong a decision, you should' make it appear that you have neglected no single means lordships a case in which your lordships' predecessors took great steps with regard to the privileges of your lordships House, and with a view to strengthen and" extend those privileges. There is hardly any one of vour lordship who will not agree in thinking that it was fortu nate they were defeated in tte attempt. I allud to the peerage cpestion. It passed this House twice but was defeated in the House of Commons by thc efforts o that great and sagacious statesman, Sir Kobct Walpole Your lordships have been entreated not to irevent the House coming to a decision by any unnecessary delay ; but mylords, whatever may be the evil of delay, even for a short duration, it is noi to he compared with th evil of being taunted in having hastily, and without th fullest and maturest consideration, come to a elecirion upon so important a question. (Hear, hear.) - I shall, there fore, vote with the greatest satisfaction for the motion o my noble friend, and conclude by requesting your lordships to support a propositioo for referring this matter to the judges. ' (Hear, hear.) '..?.* Their lordships then divided, and the numbers were:Contents-Present......... ... C2 Proxies ...... "". ... 49 - 111 Non Content-Present .........97 Proxies .........45 - 142 Majority ...... 31 The motion wes consequently lost. Their lordships then went into committee. Mr. Thomas Ton-ins was then called, and examined by XordXl--ihdest.-Hedeposedthaiheha dcarefully searched therecords in the Rolls Chapel from the reign of Richard IH. to Mary, and that, he had not found more than two instances of the creation ofa peer for life during that period. TheXOKD CHANCELLOR wouM not subject his noble and learned friend to the necessity of proving a negative, but would admit that he knew of ho other cases, withthe exception of some 18 cases of peerages being coi-'erred njion women; and of some in which a peerage had been conferred upon persons for life, with remainder to collateral heirs.-. ? . Lord LYNDHURST then rose, and said,-Mylords,'I am not sure that I shall be able adequately to peifonn ike task which I have undertaken, or whether jmy strength will be sufficient for that purpose; but having undertaken that task, 1 shall perform it to the uinost of my power,1 and I shall confine myself as strictly as possible to those matters which appear to. me io bear ."ireetiyupon the matter now before your lordships, and which, I think, will enable your lordships, to form* correct opimon upon this important constitutional ejuestietu I shall not, I hope, find it necessaiy to take iip very mich of your ordships''time, because ihe subject has been so fully iliscussed already, and there are so manyof yourlordships who are intimately accraainted with its details. In the first place, I find it necessary to direct my attention to the subject of the jurisdiction of your lordships oithis qnestion. I should havo been satisfied to have kepi silent upon that subject as your lordships have affirmed your jurisdiction by consenting to enter upon this Commjitee of Privilege, were it not that my noble and learned fiiend opposite has npon more than one occasion denied that jurisdiction, and, permit me to say, has denied it in a tone and manner not very respectful io yohr lordships, for he has intimated, obscurely I admit, but still in a manner- intelligible to me, ttat your lordships' decisidh; whatever it may be,' will be entirely unavailing. The other House of Parliament, mylords, stands in a more fevourahle wtuation th-n'we do in ejnestions of this nature. The S_eakerof the other^HouseJof Pa-tpamerit is tho gu_c_i*n of the privileges.of-tiTa'House; aoi of ita authority, a-d, if those privileges ire invaded^ he is there for the purpose of defending the' cliaracter'of theHouse.- I regret that tte noble andlearoedlordhavniigM-o-_nendeda ? mcasui'C which almost'all your lordships have considered an' impro-..ct*ndiMhra.it«u"e, stadrfortraj-dsu-l declares' that our censure of that measure, if passed, willbe altogether unavailing. My noble and learned friend says we haveno jurisdiction in the matter, that we ought not to touch H locause that would be an offence against the prerogative, and ttat we cannot give effect to the opinion we may express. But, mylords, thereis something even more extraordinary tbantlns. A learned person who has never had a seat ia this house is waiting to have your lordships' doors opened to admit him. He knows nothing of your, lordship, privi* -eges and your rights, he has never had an opportunity ot "-econnng conversant with them, and he tells ns ihat we aro tKuSJt* wBicl1 w. ^TP no ril** .» "lo. Td that whatever "EX-E^"^ton-his case will be unavailing. But, rb"!n&T^J^CIlrUUOni?'B^fomi,led, there isa£end to the independence of yourlen_-ir-« House. (Cheeis.) Tha ^ter^thebme-r-mgmavtrample upon your'rights and pnvilege*-, and you will lie prostrite Toefore _h_. (Cheers.) .Sut, myIoids, Inndertak.to stateandto prSveT m opposition.to the opmion of thenoble and leamedlord; that there is no foundation for the opinion whicl Ms thus been expressed. My lords, a case has been put before yonr lordships which has been considered decisive as to the jurisdiction of your loidships. But I vrill advert to that case to show ihat this privilege which we ara nowconridei-igisadnuttedlypartoftheindependenceofyour lordships'House. Mylords, everybody knows thatan alienhas no right whatever to sit in your lordships* house. At tho same time every body knows the Crown has a perfect right to confer a peerago on an alien. Suppose that aa alien had obtained a writ of summons and presented himself at yonr lordships' bar, are your lordships, quietly to suffer him to take his seat without interference, and are wa all to be passive spectators of the violation of the lawand tobeco-oporators withhiminthe violation of the law ? (Hear.) Is this not sufficient to satisfy your lordships that yon have a right to. investigate the title by which a wer, claims admittance into your lordships' house ? I will pnt another case equally striking. It has been said by Lord Coke-I know not on what authority-that the Crown cannot grant a peerage for years, and ho gives a reason for it which every lawyer knows. But suppose that a person created apeer ibr life comes to the bar andbrings his writ of summons. Suppose your lordships look at the patent and find that it contains a peerage for life, are you to admit bim totake his seat, and suffer him to violate the law, and to become, indeed, co-operators with him in the violation of the law _ That would be abrogating your right; and would it not ba your duty to prevent him from taking the oaths and his seat awing yourlordships? Look at the form of proceeding. vvhen a pearson comes to ihe bar with his patent of creation and his writ of summon*-, what is the first steo tiat is taken? Tho first step is to read the patent Why is that patent read? For what purpose is it read if yonr lordships are to exercise no privilege with respect to it? (Hear.) Or, is it not read that your lordships ma-.-have an opportunity of comidering its validity and acting according to the opinion you may form respecting it? I consider these cases very decisive as to your lordships' authority andl junsdiction. Mylords, it isthe right and duty of your lordships, and of every assembly snmmoned in a similar manner, to see that the assembly to which they belong i3 properly constituted. If a writ of summons to which a party is entitled is withheld, your lordships have a right to insist that it shall be produced. If, onthe other hand, a party appears with an invalid patent, your lordships have an equal right to prevent his admission into this assembly. In both cases the right is the same, and it is your duty as well as your right to see that the House of Peefe is properly constituted. My noble and learned friend says wo have no means of enforcing that right. Mylords, I will explain that in a few words. If a writ of summons is improperly withheld, your lordships can insist npon its being issued. Yon may address tho Crown for that purpose if you think proper. If that address to the Crown is unavaili-g, there is a remedy that in a remarkable case hasbeen resorted to. Parliament in that case refused to proceed to business nntil the writ of summons was issned and nntil the House was properly constituted, andthe historianreenrded this fact that themeans adopted were so effectual that theKing was induced to issue the writ of summons, '--at is a remedy when tha writ of summons is withhel'' n the other hand, when a parly has obtruded himso" V-."1 ihe House, in which he has no right to sit, the - vuy is eam-lly plain. It is your duty to direct your liTS. *° refuse to administer the oaths or allow the ,-.'-^ to take his seat? (Hear, hear.) So much for that '.*' °| tne question. Now, my lords, with respect to the inwadents in the case. My noble and learned friend no onbtremembei-s that there was only one precedent adduce -the case of the Hamilton and Brandon peerage. I thin).1T? yourlordships can hardly have forgotten the kind/1 ton-plant air with which he statethat he wonld s.°n. dispose of tho authority of that case.

T| conirse of proceeding, but tho judgment pronr.!^T Dy *ne House was reversed. In the Brandon casoiSlulfS1?11 'was> on two separate occasions, raised in a very marke. manner as to tte control of this House over the writ of sifflons. What couise did theHouse take on that occasion? referred the ejuestion to the Comnuttee of Privileges. On two oisions petitionwere presented to the Honse, and in both they wireferred to the Conimittee of Privileges, which investigated'* title of the claimant. He ultimate result was ihat the _;<wasnot satisfied with tho titles, and the Tjotitions wera dismissed. There is another case to which I am particularly desirous io allude, in consequence of some reference having been made to it by thc noble lord the President of the CouncU; I aUude to the case ofthe Earl of Banbury. One of tiie clahr-nts to this peerage had the -misfoit-ne to be engaged in a duel, and came by jietition before your lordship/House, asking to be tried by his peers. The House refeired tho case to the Committee of Privileges to investigate his title. The question, in another shape, came before tho Court of Queen's Bench, and Loid Chief Justice Holt took upon hiin to say that this Househad nojuris'iictiou inthe matter. Now, mylords, I am anxious topoint out the erroneous conclusion arrived; at by Lord Holt on this occasion, because I believe my noble and learned friend, and other noble lords, have placed -considerable reliance on his decision. Nothing conld hemore erroneous in principle than that decision was. It is clear that you had a direct jurisdiction where an application was made to you by a peison e_a___g to he a peerIt was only for this House to say whether such a person should bo tried by his peers or not. It is a clear point of la-w^to the accuracy of which every lawyer will subscribe, thai where any tribunal has a junsdiction in a particulai: matter it las also a jurisdiction incident to it over every matter that it is necessary to know.in order to be able to form a c«Tect judgment regarding it. (Hear, hear.) Lord Holt's opinion was, therefore, erroneous, for the House haaclearly jurisdiction in this case as to the principal matter-viz., whether the peison claiming had a right to be tried.by his peers, and, having that jurisdiction, they had-a right to inquire whether the claimant was a peer ornot. (Hear.hear.) Perhaps I should hardly have ventured t) express this opinion had it rested on my authority alone, but it is confirmed by one of the highest legal authorities chat ever sat in your lordship's house-I mean LoiRede-Ude. (Hear.hear.) I shall read an extract from an opinion given by Xord Redesdale in a m-sequent Banbury casethatcame before the Honse. Hesaid:"This resolution, passed as it was with great solemnity,' onjht in my opinion to have all the force ofa judicial dec-ton. No doubt can be entertained of the jurisdiction of tie House, for surely it had a right to determine whether the petitioner was entitled to he tried as a peer, and this I conld not be done without ascertaining whether he was leg--iinat-" '.Again- - ?. ? ' "1 tliink Lord Chief Jnstice Holt was nustaken, if what fell from him is correctly reported, otherwise the Crown might refuse a writ, in a subsequent Parliament, to anv Peer now sitting inthe House." Montesquieu, in-writing his views of the British constitution, makes use of the following observations respectiug the peerage!- - - * " w-"!^ Vy of thenobflity ought to be hereditary.

' ned the decision of tho House on this case. I have shown that that decision was impeached by the authority I have mentioned-viz., Lord Holt; and I think 1 have shown that the decision at wiiich he arrived was erroneous; anj this is one' of the cases by which my nobis and learned friend is guided on this occasion.

MOORE wished to put a question to the First Lord of the Admiralty with regard to the reported loss of Her Majestry'a ship Nerbudda, off the coast of Africa, in June last He had been told by the relatives of officers who were on board that ship that the first information they had received of the disaster was contained in Tite Times of August last, and that no official report had gone forth from the Aainiralty either to tbe public or to those more iminjsdjL. ately" mterested. Great surprfs* """4 great pain had been eaused by the absence of any olu.'na* information as to the loss of a ship containing 180 souls, <*"* ne therefore requested the First Lord of the Admirali!71° state whatever details had reached him npon ihe subject. Sir C. WOOD was veiy sorry to say that all _ie accounts he had received wero of a completely negative cJ*Aaracter. The only information in the possession of the Goveifmient »_._ that thoNerbudda had been sent to the eastern co_«tof Africa, and had never since been heard of : bnt of coui_" the AxUniralty would, not be justified in making any pubiio statement on the subject until the last hopo was gone. He could not, however, entertain the slightest hope that the Nerbudda had not foundered at sea. The Admiralty knew that she had not gone into the port of Madagascar, and, in fact, the only information they possessed was that there was an absence of all information. TORTURE IN INDIA. Mr. OTWAY gave notice that on an early day he should call attention to the report of the commissioners appointed to examine into the practice of torture in India, and_llonld submit a motion on the subject. POSTAL COMMUNICATION WITH IRELAND. Mr. GROGAN asked the Secretary to the Treasury whether any and what steps, since the issuing of the minute of the 19th day of October, 1855, had been taken by the Government to facilitate and improve the postal and passen* ger communication between London and Dublin; whether the hours of departure from and arrival at those cities respectively of tbo mails, and the time to be employed on the journey, had been decided on; whether any tenders for the performance of this service had been called for bythe Government; whether any tenders for this service had been sent in to the Government; and what was the present state of negotiations on the subject ? Mr. WILSON said, he had communicated with the Chambeis of Commerce of Dublin-nd Belfast, in order to fix the hours for the departure of the mails from and their arrival at those cities. Tenders were now being prepared and would in a short time be submitted to the companies, and they would then be required to name the sum for which thoy would undertake the service. IRISH BUSINESS. In reply to Mr. Serjeant O'Brien, Mr. HORSMAN said, no further progress would be made withthe Juvenile Offenders (Ireland) Bill and the Burialgrounds (Ireland) Bill until after Easter. He proposed to take the second reading of the Prisons (Irelandy Bill on Monday, but to postpone going into committee uponit until after Easter. ST. PANCRAS WORKHOUSE. Mr. PERCY asked the President ofthe Poor Law Board whether a report had been presented to the Government on the state ofthe St. Pancras or St. MaiyleboneWorkhouses; and whether he would lay such report on the table of the house? Mr. BOUVERIE said, in consequence of a report he had received in November last from one of the ordinaiy inspectors of the Poor Law Board, he had appointed a medical gentleman of eminence as a temporary inspector to inquire into the state of St. Pancras Workhouse. He had recently received that gentleman's report, in which the state of things was described as horrible. Ho had directed that it should be communicated to the authorities of St. Pancras, and he entertained strong hopes that they would bo induced to apply an urgent remedy to the evils pointed ont in it. He had no objection to lay the report on the table. The management of the poor of St. Pancras was carried on under a loca1 act, and the Poor Law Board did not, therefore, possess the same control over that as over other parishes. LOCAL DUES ON SHIPPING BILL. Mr. HORSFALL asked whether any alteration had taken place in the intention of the Government to proceed with the Local Dues on Shipping Bill on Monday? Lord PALMERSTON.-It is the intention of tho Government to move the secondreading of that bill on Monday. Sir F. THESIGER gave notice that, on the motion being made, he should move that the bill be read a second tima that day six months. (Hear, hear.) OATH OF ABJURATION. Sir F. THESIGER asked the nght hon. gentleman the memberfor Manchester whether he intended to proceed with his motion for leave to introduce a bill to abolish tbo oath of abjuration to-night, as it could not come on until after the Govemment business had been disposed of 1 Mr. GIBSON thonght he might obtain leave to introduce the bill without opposition, upon the undeistanding that the discussion should be taken upon the second reading. He would ask the hon. and learned gentleman, and also the noble lord at the head of the Government, whether they had any objection to that course being taken ? Lord PALMERSTON had no objection to it whatever. Sir F. THESIGER also thought it would be the most convenient couise. THE ARMY ESTIMATES. Sir D. L. EVANS hoped the Government would allow the House a few days more for the consideration of tha army estimates, which had been placed upon tho paper for to-night. They were of peculiar importance; they were different from former estimates, and they had not been circulatedmany days. Lord PALMEKSTON said, althongh the estimates were so far new in form that one body of papers contained what was formerly in different estimates, yet each part was very nearly tho same as it always had been, especially with regard to the army estimates. Money being required for ihe public service, the Government intended to take a vote on account, and he therefore hoped tho House would allow them to proceed with the estimates. Sir D. L. EVANS again pressed for further delay. Lord PALMERSTON said, he had stated on the first day of the session the course which the Governinent intended to take. They proposed to lay on the tablo estimates framed for the whole year, on the supposition that the war would continue, but, considering that negotiations were about to begin, they would, in the first place, only ask Par. liamentto vote a portion of those estimates relating to matters not affected by peace or war. These sums having been voted on account, they would be obliged, in case either of peace or of war, to come to Parliament for the remainder of the estimates, and hon. gentlemen wonld then have a further opportunity of discussing them. Sir D. L. EVANS said, tbat there was a very important proposition fora certain number of men and animals forthe Land Transport service, and probably the Govemment would allow the House a little time for the consideration of that matter, DISQUALIFICAxTON OF CONTRACTORS. Mr. T. DUNCOMBE gave notice that on the second reading of the Contractors Disqualification Repeal Bill on Wednesday next, he would move that it be read a second time that day six months. THE DRESS OF DEPUTY-LIEUTENANTS. Mr. KINNAIRD said, that he had been erroneously re> presented as giving a notice respecting the dress of deputylieutenants, and in consequence had received a vast deal-of communication from parties concerned in the matter. _Laughter.) He therefore wished to disclaim any interest in the subject himself. EDUCATION. On the motion that the House at its rising should adjourn till Monday, SirJ. PAKINGTON took the opportunity of asking the noble lord the member for London, whether he had any objection to give some further explanation of the course he intended to take with respect to his education resolutions ? He (Sir J. Pakington) could not help thinking that the course which the noble lord intimated last night he intended to take was unusual, and likely to be attended with some inconvenience. At the commencement of the session ihe noble lord intimated that, in consequence of tha dilfii'-tywhichindependentmembeisfelt in proposing bills, he thought the most convenient couise for nim totake would be to move resolutions and call on the House to pronounce an opinion on them; and, when the noble lord gave his notice yesterday, he (Sir J. Pakington) hoped the noble lord was going to take that course. But the noble lord mentioned that on Thursday week he would only make a statement, and not call on the House to pronounce any opinion. This appeared io be an unusual couise, and might have the effect of creating apprehension among those who took an interest in the subject that the matter would be again indefinitely postponed. All that he desired was, that the House should come to some sound conclusion on the subject, and he therefore wished to know whether the noble lord had any undeistanding with theGovernment as to the further progress of his resolutions, or in what way he proposed to call on the House to pronounce an opinion on them ? Lord J. RUSSELL said, that the right hon. gentleman had entirely xnisundeistood what he had stated. He certainly did not intend to state that he did not mean to ask for the opinion of the House on his resolutions when the proper opportunity came, but that he did not mean to do so on the 6th of March, because, as there were several resolutions it would be hardly fair to ask the House to come immediately to a decision on the subject. But, after placing the resolutions on the table of the house, and of course moving the first one as a matter of form, he should propose to postpone them till a future day. He certainly had no undeistanding with the Government as to the day when he should again bring them under consideration, but he recollected that, when Sir R. Peel brought forward the Controverted Elections BUI, he (Lord J. Russell), being then inthe Government, gave the right hon. baronet a Government day for the purpose. If, happily, the negotiations at Paris should end in peace, no subject to which the House conld turn its attention could b3 of greater importance than that of education (hear, hear), andhe should then, not pressingthe Government, of course, to give **,-? a day while urgent business was coming on, which the affairs of the country might render it desirable to be immediately discussed, request the noble lord at ths head of the Government to consent that, at a certain time, these resolutions should be taken into consideration-discussed from day to day until the House pronounced au opinion on the subject. (Hear, hear.) He trustedthatthis course would be satisfactory to the right hon. gentleman opposite, whose wishes he should wish to consult, as he had taken so great an interest in the subject. (Hear, hear.) LESSEES OF CHURCH PROPERTY. Mr. PRE WEN, after observing that, under a recehi enactment for the enfranchisement by the Church Estates Coi_xiis3ioners of tha leases of church property on certain terms, mo3t unjust exactions had been made in many instances on thc lessees, inquired of the First Lord of the Treasury if it was the intention of the Government to introduce any measure during the present session calculated to place the. lessees of church property on a uiore just and Ctiiiitable footing than that in which tiley were pi*",?3 "B^r the existing acts ? Lord. PAI-tERSTON replied, that a committee lia_ fca33 appomted for the express purpose of inqniring into the constitution of the Ifcclesiastical Commission and the manner in which this particular question was dealt yriSt by them ;and, of course, it was not the intention of the Goran. ment to propose any measure while that committee wn* puisumg its inquiries. What might bo done afterwarrwould depend on their report. THE TERRxTORxES OF OUDE. Mr.. OTWAY said, that some time ago various rumours were in circulation as to the intentions of the Indian GoTemment in respect to the territoiities of Onde. It was at first said that the affairs of that kingdom were to be administered by General Outiam, the Resident at Lucknow. It was subsequently affirmed that th9 territories were to be sequestrated, and it was now alleged that tho king was tobe tleUironed, and that his dominions were to be annexed to the Bnhsh dominions in India. Ho thought that this was a matter on which the House ought to have some eariy information. He would not enter into the discussion of the question of annexation at the present moment, or of the relations generally between the Indian Govemment and the native States; but he mieht be iiennitted to state that the Secretaiy of the Government jn 1814 wrote to Ma.orBailhe, the then Resident atLucknow rMuesting him to obtain a loan of a crore of rupees from the Nawab, as, without that loan, the Government would suffersenous embarrassment; and the resident, in replv stated that he had obtained, with great difficulty, a loan ef 60 lacs of rupees, as his Excellency had at fiist some suspicions of the d_mterestedness of the Indian Government, for some persons had informed him that the obiect was to plunder him of his wealth, and, when he had no more money, to take his conntry from him. The resident at JLucknow was on another occasion also requested to try his admirable skill to obtain a sum of money from the Nawab, as a temporary loan merely; but it was scarcely necessary to stato that no portion of the sunobtained from him had ever been returned. He had no wish to enter into a discussion on the subject at present, and would, therefore, _mply content himP3" With asking the right hon. gentleman whether instructions had been sent out to Lord Dalhousie, empowering him to sequestrate and annex the territories of the King of Oude at his discretion, and also whether any desire had been manifested by the people of Oude to come under our dominion? He would also ask when thecorrespondence relative to the subject would be lairl on the table ? aw _u Mr. V. SMITH said, it was not usual to lay correspondence on the table of the house until it was concluded, neither washe prepared to break tlirough that rule in the present instanceIt was well known that for the last 56 years, or thereabouts, tho state of the kingdom of Oude had excited the attention of, and caused much anxiety to, the Government of India. During the last summer the xrialadmiiiistration of that countiy had reached such a pitch that General Outram had reported to the Governor-General that it was impossible it could be allowed to exist longer. This opinion was reported by the Governor-General to the home Government, together with a statement of several modes in which it was thought by himself and gentlemen with whom he had consulted that the deplorable state of things might be put an end to That despateh of the Governor-General was taken into consideration by the Court of Directois in conjunction with Her Majesty's Government, and, after going ihrough the yarious details of the question, it was detenninedthat looking to the high reputation and ihe great experience of Lord Dalhousie, no better course could be taken than to leave a large discretion with him as to the best means of dealine with that country. This determination was commmiicated to Lord Dalhousie on the 21st of November last, and all the answer which as yet had been received from him ou tho subject wasia simple acknowledgment of the pride which he had felt m bemg intrusted with that descretion, and an expression of his deteimmation to take the respon_bilitvuponhimsel£ He added, however, that, whatever course he .pursued, he shonld use every possible means of avoiding all chance of a collision, and that he should have the most scmpulous regard to the feelings and claims ofthe natives. Thus the question stood It the present moment; but when a more detailed answer had been received from the Governor-General, and the correspondence had been brought to a close, he would lose no time in laying it on the table. With regard to the second question, he was not aware that any petitions had been received from the people of Oude requesting to be broueht under our rule; but it must be remembered that one ofthe most monstrous features of the Government of the kin<rdom of Oude was, that it suppressed all manifestations of feeling on the part of ihe people. . Sir E. PERRY thought the explanation of the right hon. gentleman most unsatisfactory. It was well known that for some years^past a new principle of policy had beenlaid down by Lord Dalhousie, and acted npon bv him-he would not say unscrupnlously, but most perfinaciously. This principle was, that it was the policy of Great Britain to annex every native Stato whenever an opportunity mcurred, and now, a question having arisen whether a great kingdom should be annexed or not, it was to be left-as he undeistood the nght hon. gentleman's answer-entireiv to the discretion of the Governor-General, without there being any responsibility on the part of-the Govern. ment at home. The doctrine laid down by the GovernorGeneral was opposed to the opinions of tho most eminent of Se raIlLsef^\-,nindla~!0rth? «ftoUms of snch men as Mountstuart Elphinstone and Lord Metcalfe; and he honed ttie right hon. gentleman the President of the Boaidol Control, by laying: the papers on the table of the house would give the House an oppoitnnity of expiessine its opinion as to tho rectitude of this policy. Sir J. W. HOGG thought it was scarcely fair of the hon. and learned gentleman to anticipate the legitimate opponmmty of discussing this subject, which he himsett had pointed ont for the purpose of denouncing the polioy of one of the most disbnguiihed inlers India had ^er known. (Hear, hear.) He hoped the House would not take its idea of Lord Dalhouae's pohcy from the statement of tha hon^d learned gentleman. He utterly denied the truth of the statement ofthe hon. member for Stafford withre°ard to the monetary transactions of the Indian Government with the Kin" of Oude. Eveiy farthing received from the Kine of Oude had been received from him in tho way of loan and it had always bome the hi?hest current rate of interest! .Eveiy loan had been repaid either in money or by transfer of territory, and if any portion reniained unpaid it continued to bear the regular payment of interest justthe same as any other loan granted to the Government of India, One reason which had induced the King of Onde to make these loans was, that he was afraid, from the disordered state of his country, that his widows and other membeis of his family for whom he was anxious to provide would be left entirely without, support at his demise, and he was desirous in this way of making the East India Company responsible for the payment of a regular stipend to these persons. Such statements as thoso of the hon. member for Stafford, injurious as they were to the credit and honour of*individuals belongmg to the Government of India, ought not to be made except upon good grounds, and unless those who made them were prepared to support them. Mr. J. G. PxHIxLIMOBE reminded the House that the hon. member who had put the question had done so on the autliontyof a despatch from the resident at Lucknow to :W Hastings, which itself disclosed a case of great hardship. The observations of the hon. and learnedgentleman fte member for Poifcmouth (Sir E.Perry), in regard to Lord Dalhousie, had been elicited bythe panegyric which had beenpassedupon that nobleman by the right hon. eentleman he President of the Boardof Control, ft appe_fd to hta Oxr-PhiHimore) from all he had seen and read, that Lord Dalhousie wgi inflamed with a dangerous spirit of ac-grandisement. He had entangled us in one most unjust and mdefensiblewar.andwas not a peison to whom he (Mr. Philhmore) should like a question of this importance to ba XelQTTGxu Mr. ROEBUCK warnedi the Honse to be veiy cautions of taking upon trust the ebullitions of virtuous indignation of the hon. member for Honiton (Sir J. W. Hogg).' (A lamm.. That hon. member denied in that house the truth of tte assertion as to the practice of torture in India (Hear hear.) Taking that as an example and illustration of the value of the denial ofthe hon. gentleman, he(Mr. Roebuck) left him and the House to settle the matter. (Alaugh.) THE DIxraCTIVE CLOTHING OF THE GERMAN LEGION. vvx-ijiiax. Sir J. FERGUSSON, in justice to a firm which had beenmenfaoned on the preceding evening as having supphed tho defective trousers to the cavalry of theClernum legion, concerning which he had pnt a question to the hon. gentleman the Clerk of the Ordnance, stated that he had -received fro- tho firm in question, Messrs Hibbert and Co.,.a letter, of which he would read but one pass-re Thatpassage was as follows:- *--_=. "The name of our firm has been mentioned as the suppliers, of these articles. As the charge of inferioritv of materials is still unrefuted, we think it right to state that we were not the exclusive contractors for the trousers, and that the number supphed by us, as we are ready to prove was supenor to the received pattern." f " He believed he wascorrect in statingthat buta small portion of the clothing was supphed by Messis. Hibbert and Co., tho greater part having been made by otherfirms. One circumstance which ought to be known was, that the pattern for these trousers was bound with a description of leather called Spanish hoisehide. The leather used bv Messrs HibberiandCo. was of that description, but otter firms made the straps of an lnfenor article called sheepskin. ._ The motion for' the adjournment of the House until Monday was then agreed to. . . .- METROPOLITAN COMMUNICATIONS. Sir B. HALL gave notice that, on Monday next, he should move the appomtment of a select committee to consider the best means of providing a communication between the part ofthemetropolistothenorthandthose lying to the south and south-west of St. James's Park. (A laugh.) WAYS AND MEANS. FmANCIAI, S_A*a____5"_. :?-'; The House having resolved itself into a Committee of Ways and Means, Mr. IaTZROY in the chair, - TheCTHANCEl_AORoftheEXC_BQUERro"andsaid,. -It now becomes my duty to movo certain resolutions, and to lay before the committee such explanation as is necessary' for their infoimation in regard'to them. The ordii-iypractice, when pacific relations subsist between the Government Cf Her Majesty and thoso of other independent States, is for tho Finance Minister.to submit to the House each year one -uancial statement comprising the revenue and expenditure oftho preceding year, togetherwith his "timate of those for tte ensiling one. That practice has. -been found- <"n: venient to the House, because it places beforo it at one view the finances of the two years under considoration.

Although it might Lave been in some respects' more safefactory to tho House that there should t1"" ^een only ona financial statement during the present set.-on> yet, considering the great efforts which the countrj has _'ade during the lartyear.'con. sidering the great expenditure w_ ich ttose efibrto have occasioned, it may be sat-factoiy to hon. members to leam at an early period of the session tte stateof onr revenue and expenditure. Uncertainty on a question oi* this sort mnst be attended witt inconvenience. In friendly _marters it giro rise toapprehensions, in unfriendly ones to Kopes ; both of whichthe committee will see from my statemeiit are completely groundless. I will now, with the peixnissicin of the committee, recall to its recollection the statement wiiich I made on the 20th ofApril last, in submitting the budget for the year. The revenue, inclnding new taxes, I estimated at 67,339,000*.; the loan was 16,000,000*., and thero was likewise an estiniate for Exchequer Snpply Bills to the amount of 3,000,000*., making tte total estimated revenue 86,339,000*. The expenditure, as I estimated it on that day, includingthepayment of 1,000,000*. for Ways and Means bills of the preceding year,-that is to say, biUs to cover expenditure incurred during the preceding year, and 1,000,000'. for the Sardinian loan, was 8L899,000'. The difference between these two sums was 4,440,000*., which was tte maigin or surplus upon which I had calculated in that statement. Inthesupplementaiy statement which it became necessary for me to make on tho 2d of August last, I stated that in tho former calculation I had estimated the total Ways and Means at 86.339,000'.; but that since that calculation was made I had abandoned an estimated amonnt of 200,000*. from a stamp duty on bankers' checks, thus reducing the estimated revenue to 86,139,000*., and the estimated surplus to 4,240,000*. The expenditure, as estimated on the 20th of April, amounted to 8L899,O00*., but the committee wili recollect that, towards the end of the session, certain supplementary estimates for the milit-y service were laid before theHouse and votedin Conimittee ofSupply. These supplementary estimates amounted to 6,135,000'., making a total expenditure for the year of 88,034.000*. To meet tbis expenditure there was, as before stated, tha reduced estimate of Ways and Means, amounting to 86.139,000*. An additional grant of Exchequer-bills and bonds was taken, in consequence of the increased expenditure amounting to 4,000,000*., making a total provision for the year of 90,139,000*. The increased expenditure being 88,034,000*. there remained a surplus of 2,105,000*. But this surplus was in a great measure required to restore ihe balances, which hadbeen assisted at the commencement of the year by Ways and Means bills to the amount of 1,700,000*. which were chargeable on the revenue of the current year. The second statement, therefore, presented nearly an equal amount of receipts and expenditure. It now remains to state how far that estimate has been verified by the result. Wo are now not very far from tho end of tte fourth quarter of tte year terminating on ihe lst of April next, and the statement I am about to submit for the consideration of the House gives an account of the receipts and expenditure np to the latest period, together with an estimate as accurate as circumsiances will permit, and derived from reliable authority, of the probable income and expenditure during tte unexpired portion of the current quarter:ESUMATKD REVJ_tU_ AND EXPENDITCIlE TOR THE Financial Year 1855-6.

With regard to the Castoms' tte deficiency in that department of revenuo is chiefly referable to the article of sugar. Sugar, tea, and coffee were the articles on which there was an increase of duties last year. With, respect to the two latter, the result has corresponded as nearly as possible with the estimate; aud it does not appear that the additional duty on those articles of foreign and colonial produce has materially diminished the consumption. As far as tea is concerned, the consumption has actually increased; the quantities entered for home consumption during the last three years being respectively as follows-in 1853, 58,860,0001b.; in 1854, 61,970,0001b.; in 1S55,63,454,0001b_ (Hear, hear.) The same result is observable inthe article of coffee. The great speculation in sugar arose at the latter end of October and the beginning of November, and was based on tte short importations, which, up to the SOth of October, were as follows:-In 1853, 317,000 tons; in 1854, 389,000; in 1855, 281,000 (hear, hear); and as the consumption has continued very large, the stocks on hand were reduced to nearly one-half the usual quantity. For the whole year of 1855, as compared with 1853 and 1854, the importations of sugar might be thus stated:-In 1853, 364,000 tons; in 1854, 455,600; in 1855. 367,000. The final deficiency, however, at the close of the year was not so great as it appeared at the end of October. The difference is no doubt chiefly to be attributed to the short supply of the article. As for the Excise, the deficiency in that branch of revenue is almost entirely owing a cause which some members of this House may not deplore, and which certainly cannot be regarded as a moral evil-tte insufficient produce of the duty on spirits. (Hear, hear.) Several circumstances combined to bring about this result. One was the large drawback repaid on malt in consequence of a change made last year in the mode of taking the duty on spirits manufactured from malt; but the main cause was the high price of corn during the present year. The cost of provisions, cutting as it did into the wages of the working classes, fur-ishes a complete solution of tte deficient result as far as the spirit duty is concerned. Since the loth of September the average price of corn has not been under 75s., and for six months it was above 80s. (Hear, hear.) There is another cause which may have to some extent influenced the price of spirits, and diminished tte revenue derivable from that article. This cause is one which1 has proved beneficial to the distilling trade, and has augmented the demand for barley. I think the great increase which has taken place in the courso Of last year in the exportation of British spirits has arisen in consequence of the extensive failure of the wine crops on the continent. The great diminution in the wine produce of the continent, owing to that heavy failure, has not only diminished the quantity of wine, but also the quantity of brandy, and led to large exportations of British spirits to supply the void ttus created, those spirits yielding nothing to the revenue because, being exported from bond to foreign countries, they are subject to no payment of duty. Under tte head of stamps there has been an increase,' but, coincident with that increase, there has also been a loss, as was anticipated in my estimates of last year, amounting to 220,000?. from the rein-sion of the stamp on newspapers. That loss has to a certain extent been compensated by tho Postoffice" revenue accruing from the stamps received on newspapers posted witliout an impressed stamp. Nevertheless, on tte whole/the receipts ofthe Post-office exhibit a d_ninution. The direct taxes, the property-tax, and: tie assessed taxes, have, as the committee will perceive, yielded more than we estimated ttey would produce. With" regard to the excess in the expenditure, the whole of that excess, within 300,000*., has been owing to the supplementary estimates which have been either voted in the course of the present Session, or which now lie on the table of tte houso for future consideration.- These supplementaiy estiinat" are as follows*--- ..;. ? ?-' 1st, Oi-mace.-Deficiency in the fcnount of the grant for 1855-6. ... ... ;.,.,. £1,34_,633 0 0 2d, Navy.-Excess of exjienditTxre beyond the grants for 1854-5, on the final closing tif the account for that year ; ..'. . ...

Themarghx which I originally left at 4,400,000*. would, as nearly as possible, be exhausted, and would leave tte revenue and the expenditure at the end of the year almost equally balanced with the surplus that is in the Exchequer. The.resolntions which I shall place in the hands ofthe) Cha_-an are intended to enable the Government, with tha consent of this House, to restore the finances of the country in the present quarter to tte position in which tbey would have stood if the estimates which I subnutted last session. had been verified by the event. That is really all, or littles more than all, that I seek to effect by the resolutions on. which the vote of this committee is now to be taken. Tha excess in the expenditure and the deficiency in the revenuo leaving a sum of about 4,400,000'. to be provided for, I shall lay before the committee resolutions for raising a sum of 5,000,000'. sterling, which will be an ample supply for the service of tho present quarter, and wili also yield some surplus, out of which to meet immediate demands in the ensuing financial year. The entire sum which has been already borrowed in the. piesentyear is made up as follows:-the loan, amounting to 16,090,000'. in Exchequer-bills, and 7,000,000/. more. in Exchequer-bonds, makung together 23,000,000?. To that amount will be added, if the present resolutions should receive tte assent of this aHnmittee, a further sum of 5,000,000'., which will make tha total sum raised by loans witbin this year towards defraying tho extraordinary expenditure, 28,000,000*. I am well aware of thegreat disadvantages of imposing so> large anew burden on the public exchequer as the amount which I have just named-viz., 28,000,003*. sterling; bnt in considering the magnitude of that additional burden wa must not allow ourselves toba disheartened. Wo must not for one moment imagine that, in order to defray the ex. penses of this costly and gigantic war.we have yet loaded tho springs of our national industry with a burden which is at _1 likely to crush them. We know the apprehensions which have been entertained in former times with regard to tha successive additions made to tte national debt. . Thoso apprehensions have been happily described by a passage itt a work which, I have no doubt, most members of this Hous* have perused with pleasure and instruction. I allude to Mr. Macaulay's recently published volumes of his History of England, in which he illustrates the origin of our rational debt. After showing the unfounded alarms which someof; the greatest writers of the last century-persons profoundly versed in the nicst advanced doctrines of political eco. omy current in tteir day--entertained on this subject, Mr. M caulay says :- " A long experience justifies us in believing that F.nglimrT may, in the 20th century, Ito better able to bear a debt of 1,600,000,000*. than she is * the present time to bear her present load. But be this as it may. those who so confidently predicted that she must sink--fiist, under a debt of" 50,000,000'., then under a debt of 80,000,000*., then under a debt of 140,000,000'., then under a debt of 240,000,000*., and lastly, under a debt of 800,000,000'., were, beyond all doubt, under a twofold mistake. They greatly overrates the pressure of the burden, they greatly underrated tta strength by which the burden was to be bome." The citxrnmstances of the country ai present clearly show that we shall commit a great error if, in the words of Mr. Macaulay, we " underrate tte strength by which this bur* den is to be borne.". I w_U. with tho pennission of tha committee, call their attention to a few facts which indicate how little tho trade and tte general resources of tha country have suffered, not^vdthstanding the great efforts which it has been necessaiy to make for rarryingontha war. I first beg their attention to onr exports, whicli_. according to tte following comparison, were as follows:The tot- value of British and Irish produce was, in tta year 1853, 93,933,000*.; in 1854, 97,184,000*. : and in 1855, 97,364,000*. The value of the principal articles exported to Australia were, in 1854, 11,931,000'.; and in 1855, 6,279,000*. The value of exports to the United State3 was, in 1854, 21,410,0007,; and in 1855, x7,312,OC0Z_ The tonnage entered and cleared, with cargoes at ports in tha united kingdom:-entered,-in 1853, 7,797,000 tons; itt 1854, 7,890,000tons; and in 1855, 7,018,000 tons; cleared, -in 1853, 7,583,000 tons; in 1854, 7,870,000 tons; and in. 1855, 8,348,000 tons. Nnmbeis of vessels built in each. year:-in 1853, 798 of 203,171 tons; in 1854, 802 of 1116,942 tons; and in 1855, 1,098 of 323,200 tons. These figures, therefore, show a very slight diminution ia the value of our exports since the year 1853, which was a, year of unusual speculation both iu American and Australian produce. This decrease in our exports for 1855, as compared with those for 1853, is to be traced not to> countries with which our trade would naturally have been affected by the war, but to Australia and the United StatesIn 1854 tte value of the principal articles exported tD Australia was 11,931_,000'. ; in 1S55 it was 6,279,000'., showing a large diminution in the Australian trade which. can scarcely be attributed to tte influence of the war. Tha value of exports to the United States was, in 1854, 21,410,000'., and in 1855,17,312,000'. j but this alteration. in trade cotild not be traceable to tte effects of tte war. I willnow trouble the conimittee with an account of the tonnage* of tho shipping which, during tte last three years, has entered and cleared out of British ports, for that statement will afford an important index of the prosperity of tha countiy. The tonnage entered and cleared with cargoes at ?orts in the umtedkingdom was-in 1853,7,797,000 tons; in. 854, 7,899,000 tons; and in 1855, 7,018,000' tons, showing a small, but a veiy small, diminution. Theia has, however, been an increaso in the number of ships cleared ont. In 1853, the tonnage of ships cleared ont was 7,583,000 tons; in 1854, 7,870,000 tons; and. in. 1853-, 8,348,000 tons. I will now state the number andtonnage o£ vessels built dnringthe last tliree years. In 1853j 798 vessels were built, of 203,171 tons ; in 1854, 802, of 196,942-tons _. and in 1855, L09S, of 323,200 tons. These statistics-which. I will not trouble the committee by following out in furtherdetail-must, I think, be regarded as proving, that, in. tha words of Her Majesty's Speech at. tne beginning of th» session, 'Hheresouix^softtecotmixyareiirxmipaired;'' la. conExdering the question as to whether the ei^ien-ture f o_ the war should be defrayed by a loan or by taxation, tta committee must bear in mind that war expenditure is of necessity, in the language of political economists, unreproductive. From the very necessity of the. caso such, expenditure can produce no durable result, beyond those results of security abroad and general protection to the- liberties of* Europe, forthe sake of which this war was ~-ertaken. But that character of a war expenditure belongs equally to> revenue raised by loans and by ta-ation. If the amount E have mentioned, of more than 40,000,0001., coul_havabeen. rais ed within a year by taxation, itwould ecuallyliave been. expended iu an unreproductive manner, andw-oiildliavebe-. queathed no durable benefit to posterity. There would hava. been the same difference between such ersjwndxture and ttaexpenditure for railways, docis, canals, and other objec_.of5 reproductive outlay, whether the war expenditure had beea defrayed hy a loan or from taxation.

LQNDON. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY23, 1856. The House of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock. Before their Lordships went into the Committee of Privileges on the Wensleydale Peerage Patent, Earl GixxN-ET moved that the following questions be referred to the Judges :-Is it in the vpower of the CROwN to create by patent the dignity of a Baron of the lUnited Kingidom for life? and what privileges does such a grant confer? ILord CAmPBsrm contended that the questions did not come within the province of the Judges; nor would they be able to define all the privileges which a patent conferred. TheLoiiD CHANcELo1 supported Earl GLEN ELG's motion, and urged the House to have the assistance of the opinion of the Judges before taking a step so recldess as that proposed by the resolution to be submitted to the Committee by Lord LYNDHuEST. They would thus show the country they were really anxious before proceeding to ascertain what was the law on the subject. If, without ascertaining it, they rejected Lord WmsLEYDuAx's patent, it would be -the most unjustifiable invasion of the rights of another branch of the Constitution he had ever witnessed. The Earl of WDMIKiSEA, speaking on the general question of life peeragges, contended that they were illegal, contrary to the principle of the Constitution, and if the Ctow2iF were badly advised, might be dangerous. Lord BxoruGHAm protested against the term " reckless" applied by the LoRD Cli?i_cFLon to the proceedings of the Committee, and pointed out the impossibility of getting an answer from the Judges without a delay that would defer the decision till another session. He admitted that the Conmmittee were dealing with a part of the prerogative of the Cxoww; but in its exeircise it had trenched on the privileges of the Peers. Earl Gn,iNtsE would vote for the motion, and urged on the House the policy of taking the opinion of the Judges, as the legal authorities among the Peers differed so widely from each other. Their Lordships then divided; there appeared- CONTFUrS. Present ... ... ... ... 62 Proxies ... ... ... ... 49-111 -O-N-CONTENsTS. Present ... ... 97 Proxies ... .. .. ... 45-142 MIajority against the motion ... 31 The House then resolved itself into the Committee of Privileges. Some further documentary evidence from the records hayng been received at the bar, Lord Lvxnnua.sr proccededto movehis resolution, embodying the report of the comrmittee, which denies the validity of the patent of Lord WVExsLnBDALE, so far as it gives him the right to sit and vote inParliament. Helaiddowntwomainpositions-that there were certain limits to the power of the CRoww in the creation of Peers, and that the House of Lords had a jurisdiction anda right to decide on the validity of the patents by which commoners are admitted to the privileges of Peers. Thus an alien, though ho might receive a patent of creation, could never sit in Parliament; nor could the CRowx create a peerage for a term of years. When a person presented himself at the bar, claiming to sit and vote in that House, the Peers had the immediate right of deciding on the. validity of the claim, and with the Peers alone rested the jtuisdiction on the subject. These positions Lord LvxDHURST supported by a long and minute reference to precedents, and defied the Government to prove a single case in which the right to a seat in the House of Peers had been connected with a patent to a commoner for life. If the judicature of the House was defective, there were easy remedies; they could caU in the assistance of the Judges, and if they made some of the Scotch Judges privy councillors.they could have their help also. Rights that had sprung from long usage were not tobe lightlytouched; the succession to the CRow_v itself was founded on the same principle. They were told this power would be moderately used; but Earl GBXY had admitted by one of his resolutions that it was open to great dangers; with unscrupulouts men in power, and in times of excitement, this right might be much abulsed; and there would be a gyreat temptation to abuse it. E3Xarl GnnY contended that the right of the CRoww to grant hereditary peerages involved the power-of granting them for life; in fact, life peerages had been created down to the time of GEROGE IH.; that. these patents were given to women did not affect the principle; theyhad al the - rights of Peers, with the exception of being sum. moned to Parliament. , They- were summoned as pe"risses to attend coronations, and if they committed offences they. would be tried by the House of Peers, not bv a court of law. Most of the arguments nsed by L&rdIai;*Duxsr resolved themselves into:the proof of disuse of the po-wer of tho Ciowz, I andan assumption that the hereditary igrinciale ts the essence:of theo peerage. -If-they rejected the patent of Lord WENsLEYDALE, they would create a very dangerous precedent, as the majority of! the THouse wo6ild be erected into an irresponsible tribunal, idecidingon the acts of the CBOWS , and, that majority being quite uncontrolled, the balance of~ tho Constitution would be destroyed. HRe moved ! ie amendment given in our report. LTord SwioPE ported the originlal maotiion, though he admitted the jidicial functionsof the' 1 ouse, as far as the lay Peers were 'concerned, werec a mere moekory. - The Duke of A GYm defended the. grant of a pait to Lord W D AXE7, - and ascribed much of-the Opposition to it to professional feeling among the iaw LdrdgA wh9 feared that no lawyer would hereafter be created a hereditary peer. The policy *4nd necessity Vf the ineasird bd not been din. puted. Lord BRoUJaHAit declared thatI he lihd4 to v no doubt the creation of 'a peerage for life,. wlth the right of sittingin Parliament, was beyond the pr& rogative, wholly unknown to the law, and therefore illegaL 1 Ee cited many powers anciently axercised by the CRow-, with regard 'to taxation and representation, which, having for a long period fallen into desuetude, would be considered tyrannical if: nowrevived as parts of the prero,ative. The long disuse of the right now exercised was of' the utmost-importance; and he denied that because the CRowi' had, the unquestioned right to create hereditary peerages it had 'therefore the -power to mrake them for life, as something less. They. were a totally different thing. He. did not believe, if the House exercised its undoubted privileges, there was any danger of giving offence to the CRowN ; that was an utter impossibility, and it was a question -with which the House of- Commons had nothing whatever to do. The Peers might as weli interfere with that House in any case of disputed election. The LOnD CHAcNcsoR explained the law respect-. ing'writs of smunmons, and contended that the writ alone was the nauthority by wvhich a Peer took his seat. There were cases in dangerous times when Peers had been heavily fined for not obeying the writ; whoever-received one was bound to obey it; and Lord WENSLEvD&LE was exactly in. that posifion. The report, of .the Committee impeached the writ as wvell. as the patent,, and if the House per3isted in refusing to admit. Lord WEYsxxv,DAT,E, it would hb the most extraordinary invasioni of the prerogative he had ever heard of. - He thought the argument that this power might be abused absurd, as any attempt to do so would be c'iecked by public - opinion; nor was the right of creating hereditary peerages less liable to the same alleged objection. The House then divided; there appeared For the amendment... . ... ... 57 Against it ... ... ... ... 92 Majority ... ... - 35 Lord LYNDHURST'S motion was then put and agreed to. I The louse resumed, and immediately adjourned. In the House of Commons, on the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, Lord J. RussExT%, in reply to Sir J. PAkrcNGTOX, explained the course he intended to pursue with reference to his resolutions upon the subject of national education. In answer to an inquiry by Mr. FnEwex, Lord PALwmRST.N stated that it was not the intention of the Government to propose any measure with regard to lessees of churclh property while the inquiries of the Conmmittee on. the Fcclesiastical Commission were pending. Mr. OTWAY put a question to the PRE nsm-T of the LqcDiA BOARD concerning the inistructions forwarded to the GovERNoR-GE&ERAL of INDiA, having reference to the territories of the IKing of OUDE. Hle observed tlat. the question was one of great magnitude, involving important considerations of morality as well -as policy, and his wish was to elicit information upon the subject from the Government. He inquired, therefore, whiether instructions had been forwarded to Lord D]iuousms to sequestrate the territories of the King of OUDE, and whether there had been any manifestation of feeling in the country showing a, desire to come under our dominion. Mr. V. Smr replied that it was well known that for many years the state of the kingdom of Oukde had excited the attention and the anxiety ofour Indian Government; that the home authorities had, in their despatch, left a large discretion to the' MIarquis of DALnOUsIE in dealing withthe question; and to that despatch no answer had been received. Sir E. PERnY considered this statement to be most unsatisfactory. For some years past, he said, the policy acted upon by Lord I)ArasousIs hadbeen that of unscrupulously annexing every independentState in'India to our territories as opportunities occurred, -a policy opposed to the opinions of themost experienced of our Indian statesmen. Sir J. Hoea begged the House not to take the policy of Lord DixoiusrE and the principles of his government from the speech of Sir E. PERiu1Y. After some remarks by Mr. J. Pnrrixxonri and Mlr. ROEBUCK, the motion was agreed to. TheHouse having resolved itself into aComnmittee of Ways and Means, The CANCELLor. of the'ExcnEQrUM, previous to moving certain resolutions, laid before the Committee explanations concerning the state- of the national finances, and the reasons for deviating - from the ordinary practice of reserving these details for the Budget. He recalled to 'the recollection of the Committee the statement he made last April, when he estimated the amount of the revenue, including the loan, at 86,339,0001., and that of the expenditure at - 81j899,0001., leaving, by way of margin, a surplus -of 4,440,0001., which was subsequently reduced, by a remission of taxation, to 4,240,0001. , Supplemental estimates were afterwvards voted, to the amount of 6,135,0001., which raised the .estimated expenditure to 88,034,0001. An addition of Exchequer bills and bonds had- increased the estimated income to 90,139,0001., which left a margin or surplus of 2,105,0001. at the end of the last session. He then read accounts of the actual receipts of the several items of the revenue, the result of which was that there was a deficiency, or an amount below the estimate, of 1,600,0001., while there had been an excess of expenditure beyond the estimate of 1,960,0001., - showing that the actual state of the fiunances turned oat worse than he had estimated by 3.560,0001. After some remarks upon the causes of the deficiency in certain items of the receipts, and of the excess in the expenditure, he stated what had been the precise 'sum which the war had cost, the difference between a peace expenditure and that of 22 months of war being 43,564,0001., including Army, Militia, Conimissariat, Navy, and Ordnance. The result was that we found ourselves in the position of boing about 4,000,0001. less capable than he had estimated last session that we should be, aud the object of the resolutions he had placed in the hands of the chairman was to enable the Government to place the finances of the country in the - present year in the position in which they would have been if the estimates had not proved deficient. The first resolution was for a loan of 5,000,)OOO., which would provide aniply for the present, and leave some surplus forthe ensuinmgfinancial year. The entire sum which had been bonowed in the present.year, in cluding Exchequer bills and bonds, was 23,000,0001. If the resolution were agreed to, there would be a further amount of 5,000,0001., making a: total of 28,000,0001. Sir CoRxEwAut then entered into statistical details of the state of our trade and commerce, showing that the resources of the country were unimpaired. - The loan, he said, had been, arranged on terims not disadvantageous to the nation. Another resolution related to the fundinilg of Exchequer-bills. -These securities had been, and continued to be, at a discount, in spite of an increase- of the rate of interest : it was therefore necessary for the Executive (Wovem. ment to resort to one of two expedientseither to fund, or to- make a further advance of the rate of the interest. The process of funding was simply a conversion of one species of Government security for another.: The amount of Exchequer-bills it was proposed to fund was 3,000,000-., the total amount of outstanding bills being 23,000,0001. - Assutming that the operation succeeded in raising, the price of Exchequer-bills to par, the saving to the public thereby, in com*parison with the otheri alter'iative, of - aisincg the rate of interest, would be, '193,001. per annum. In conclusion,- he observed that' if 'the pending negotiations should produce peaice, the 'Go vernment would' have it in their piower deliberatelytoconsiderthe state-of therevenuo; bt -if 'they should unhappily not' so terminate, it'would beotheir. duty to appeal to the House to place the finances in a position vrhich' would enable them t; 'iieet'the large eitiiiates' that would be-required for war purposes. !. . : The resolutions' (which are given in the relort) were then put, and, after a, short discussion, were agreed to. . . - On the order'for going int'o a Committeei of Suppl,' ': - - ft 't-L. colonel Duiz called fow enplanatou as to' the~ very large amount of the Or-inanc; -dth2es and texp4tiated upon the contracts and nidthodo, su, plying the army with clothing, 'nrm, atid mooum .meuits,- comiplaining4of-the existing system, and le' mismmanagement,;inefficieney4 nnd incompeteflWy ia those departments of the -army.

M6NSEfi; observed'that the matters noticel by Colonel Dumm could be better diseussed in the Committee. - , r. J. W.- RiAcDO thought this was not a satisfactory answer, ,and insisted upon the inefficient system adopted for providing clothing and supplies 'for the asniiiy, which; he s'aid, drove respectable and fnir traders out of the market. He -suggested that undue sueaiis wcreternp1oyed Lord PAig.ssrT6 pointed out the inconvenience attending this, discussion, except with the latitude allowed in conmmittee. Sir DE LAoy EvAs protested against what he considered sliar,practice on the part of the Government, in calling upon the House to dtscuss estimates .f great iniportauce, framed upon a-new plan, at 36 hours' 2iotice' : The dizcusion ic6ntiuued for some time upon miscellaneous topics. At length the SPFExx was allowed to leave the chair,:and the House went into a Conmnittee ofSupply upon theArmy and Ordnance Estimate . Mr. Mo.sSLL explained the nature of the votes he proposed-Sfrst, the Ordnance supplemental estimates for tho expenditure already incurred, and 'next the- Army and Ordnance estiimates for the present yeait. - In. the course of his explanation he showed that the present war expendiiture was much below that at the end of the last war; and'he gave a very 4atisfactory account of the condition, moral as well as physical, of the army in .the O(rimea, ancl of tho a=angements Lately madei for the benefit of the troops. The supplemental Ordnance estimates amounted 1,346,0231., for 'which he proposedjto take a vote on account. The number of land! forces of all kinds to be -voted was 246,716 men (an excess of 30,378 over the vote of last year), inc1lding 22,719 foreign troops; the sum required for the land forces was 10,950,3981., aind the grand total for the effective and non-effective services was 34,998,5041., being an excess of 6,328,0071. over the votes of astyear. Mr.ATons=rwentthronghthe various items composing the aggregate vote, accounting for the excess in each, and replying to the observations of Colonel Duzu. - The sulpplemental1 estimates for barrack supplies, wages, stores, and for the scientHifi branch, amsountmng in all to },34(;,023i., were agreed to, as well as the number of the land forces, and the Cnannrais was then ordered to report progress. The DeLamere Forest Bill passed through committee. The Turnpike Trusts An'angements Bill and the Commons Enclosure Bill were read a third time-and passed. Leave was given to Mr. M. Ginsox to introduice a bill to abolish the Oath of Abjuration. The remaining business having been disposed of, the. House adjourned at 25 minutes to 1 o'clock, until Monday. -
The proceedings at the Treasury yesterday wi sel-ve to erDiglten the uninitiated portion of the public as to the way in which large sums can be won or lost on transactions apparently with so little margin as a Government Loan. On the Loan and the funding together the difference. betwe'n the tender first made by the Blessrs. RoTUscmIDs and the Government terms which they were eventually forced to accept was about 70,0001. 'It is a fair presumption that, had their tender been accepted, they would have derived that nanch more profit, or that'much less loss, by the operation, which, at this crisis, cannot but be a speculative one. At the last quotations for Consols the Government mtinimum price could not be considered low; and the Messrs. RoTHscHinD and their friends must either have had reasons of their own for thinkring the state of affairs more in their favour, or must, have reckoned on more pliant customers than they found in Lord PAL51ERSTON -and the CL4NcE::LLop, of the ExcEQUEs.. Should all go on well at Paris, and should Consols thereupon take an upwa&d start, Government will have the credit of having made a good bargain-at least, if its hardness be a proof of its goodness. In what we will hope is the very improbable contingency of a relapise into war, no doubt the capitalists will find they have been made an example of, and in that case the difference between a tender at 89J and a transaction at 90 wil be a provoking aggravation of their,loss. The public, how ever, wil reasonably take, the high rate of the Government minimumn as an element in the calculation. Where, indeed, are they to look for confidence if not in Mfinisters themselves, who can both know and do more than anybody else in the question of peace and war? These latter, therefore, have to a certain extent the power of borrowing on their own terms. Pt=12, qTi* posse videvtur. Buit, while Government deserves credit for not giving way to the compact phalanx of capitalists before them, it has certainly provoled the censure implied in Mr. CArEm's complaint. He reauested that in all future communications w.ith the StockExchange it would state the amount of the Loan at- once. In the interval between the first general announcement and that of the particular amounts some people -became possessed of the secret, and won large bets upon it. The answer was, that the CHAELLOR of the ExoHEQuEx had only followed the precedent of previous loans. This does not appear to us a sufficient reply. To be sufficient it ought also to explain how it is that a course folund harmless before has led in the present instance to a scandalous result. There has been a great deal of leakage .of Treasury iecrets lately, and it unfortunate'y comes at a time when there are also unusual efforts to put the public on a wrong scent beforehand. The operations of British, finance hate so much influence on exchanges and marklets that for the sake of fairness there ought to be the most scrupulous veracity and the most absolute seciecy in all the persons. concerned in their admiinistratian; and we cannot say that either of these rules has been observed of late. In this case the! anticipation that the Loan would be for 5,000,0001. and the funding for 3,000,0007., aeecially when backed by heavy bets, could hardly be a mere guess, though the statement, that the Government inimiumn would be' 90 was likely enough and xround enough to be nothing more. Now -that the Loan is settled we can only hope that, us Goverament has made the best bargain it cou,ld under existing circumstances, it will turn out that the contractors and purchasers ha-ve made' a stillbetter, as that will imply the establishment of a' secure and honourable peace.-
Is any argument wanting to prove the necemsity gDf unity in the administration of the Military Derartment ? A very convincing one maybefound in Me fact that four officers in high command, whose I conduct had been condemned in X report made to Ithe Secretary-of-War by the agents of the Clovernment, were lately selected as fit subjects for promotion by the Commander-in-Chief. Lord PAKMuIt kept his secret-we mean, of course, as far as official forms are concerned,-and Lord 31 eon advised thepromotions. LordH&AwnTrN officially knows nothing of the charges, and I<ord PA%xun is officially ignorint of the prouotions. This ws not put quite as clearly as we liave stated it in the course of the discussion on mursday night, or, rather, it was clearly stated, :nd then the statement was neutralized by the following observations from Lord PAhEmURE:"With respect to these appointments"-Lord PAxsszx is speaking especially of the E arl of CARD IG nndSir Rio &nA ,Arxv-"whatever mayhave been "s ated to the contrary, it is a mistalke to say ' that I am not as responsble as the Commander"in-Chief. I am quite ready, when the proper "time comes, to take upon myself such responsi"bility, and I thinkL I shaUl be ablo to submit to "the House such a defence as will be deemed satisfactory." Here, then, we have two coordinate jurisdictions. Where responsibility is divided, responsibility is practically at an end. ![here is one supreme head of the War Department, or the War Department is without any head at all The very event which we are discussing is the proof of the assertion. Had the jurisdiction over our nulitary affairs rested in the hands of a single 3rinister, is it credible that four officers whose conduct was implicated in a report made by the Commissioners of the Government would have been selected as fit persons for promotion? It is 8imply to trifle with the intelligence of his audience and with public forbearance when Lord PAmrunE takes two or three dates, and endeavours to show that he had not official cognizance of the damning report of the Crimean Commissioners until the promotion of the officers implicated was a fai accompli. The merest tyro in official jobbery 1-nows as well as Lord PARiuE how such affairs are managed, and how easy it is to throw dust in the eyes of simpletons by a little manipulation of dates. If Lord PA =Un was not officially informed of the contents of the report and of the mature of the evidence taken by the Commissioners before the 20th of January, he ought to have 3known, and surely did know, enough of the dubious oition of the officers in question to cause Lim to defer their promotion and honours until the mystery was cleared up. But then it was not 3ie who advised the promotions, but the Commander- n-Chief. That is just the point which we wish to see clearly established. There appears, indeed, to le a vague idea that the Secretary-of-State-for Wfar is ultimately responsible for the proceedings of the Horse Guards, but that is a responsibility *which. it will at all times be- easy to evade, as in the present lamentable instance. It would seem impoesible that Lord PAr,xnsx, knowing vnat he ought to have known, and what he must have known, unless he wilfully shut his eyes to the facts of the case, could have advised the promotion of these officers until their military characters had Jeen purgeed by the report of the Commissioners. As it is, Lord Pxz-3ruis inquires, and Lord BADINGE promotes, but the result of the inquiry is kept back until the promotions have taken place. It is then discovered that they were of dubious propriety, to use the very mildest expression, and mothilig remains for it but to devise a secret military commission for the purpose of quashing the report of the Govermment Commissioners, who did their duty but too honestly and too well. This fearful series of blunders, then, as we assert, constitutes a most cogent argument for placing the tdministration of our military affairs, not in Theory, but in fact, in the hands of a single great efficer of State. The country has surely purchased the right of speaking out at last. We have sacrificed enough of treasure, and of heroic blood far more than enough, on the shrine of the sysr. Let s S at last obtain a vigorous military administration, the head of it being responsible to Parliament immediately, and in an intelligible manner, for every act that takes place in the Department of War. The result of the discussion on Thursday might, when stripped of verbiage and self-contradictions, amounts to this-that the present Government is determined to maintain the double organization of the War Department and the Horse Guards, and to leave to the Commander-inChief, as heretofore, the entire control over military patronage. " Let your Lordships think well" -this was the conclusion and the pith of Lord AR3ui&s speech on Thursday night-" before "you consent to increase the authority of the "Minister and to diminish that of the Com"mander-in-Chief, by committing to the former "the administration of the patronage of the "' anny." Lord DEP.By, who provoked the discussion in the character of amicus ctzria, closed his fin3l address and the discussion in these emphatic words .-" I especially rejoice at having obtained " from the noble Lord the formal declarafion of "his determination and that of the present "Government to maintain inviolate in the hands "of the Commander-in-Chief the control of the "diasipline, the organization, and the p,atrownge " of Hm 3I&JsTy's army." It is a little difficult, under these circumstances, to see what becomes of the ultimate responsibility of the Minister, of which Lord PAlmnrsn spoke so freely in the course of the discussion,-we mean with respect to all mailitary appointments. Lord GNm, who took- a very prominent part in the discussion, enunciated in tjie- most distinct terms the theory of Ministerial responsibility for all military appointments; and such, he said, was the view which was invariably expressed by the late Duke of 'WsLNGTox. That great warrior, whose personal prejudices must hAve necesarily run in favour of a purely military adiiinistration, never appointed a general officer to any clonial command without the sanction of the Secretary-of-State. Until the year 1835, ~c~rdug to E arl GP.zr, there was not a regiment gives.awaywitbojit. the concurrence of the First :Mi*ister. When the question arose as to whether soldiers shoul4lbp allowed to wear their side-arms, the Duke -of WELLLnmTON refused to decide the pomnt, but insisted that it should be referred to the Catinet, anrd that the responsibility of the decision xhould-rest upon the Cabinet alone. All this, and great deal more than this, of the same kind, wil he found in Lord Gnxr's speech of Thursday night. It is whimsical enough that the *arl, after listeuning to Lord PiAhArux9as decLaration, which we have already quoted, and which earned the warm approbation of Lord D)m"r, because it so clearly recognized the principle of Horse Guards' patronage, appears to have been equaily gratified with it because it embodied the opposite principle. " It is, I conceive," said lord GEz., " most important for the best interests "of the country that this principle of the respon"sibility of the Government for every act, great " and small, of military administration should be " distinctly recognized, and I therefore heard with " very great pleasure what was said upon that " subject by my noble friend." These sayings are hard to be understood, and we can only say that, after a careful perusal and re-perusd of the debate of Thursday night, we are perfectly unable to reconcile the conflicting statements which appear to meet with the absolute concurs rence of atl the speakers. One's natural instinct and an unfortunately long experience of such matters point, of course, to the conclusion that nothing will be done. Lord PANAWRE appears to think that he has given power enough to Parliament in military matters when he admits that the army is dependenIt upon the House of Commons for its payment, and that, unless Parliament collectively passed the Mutiny Act, the CRoww would be unable to maintain the discipline of our forces. We are, of course, aware that by the very simple and intelligible measure of stopping the supplies the House of Commons could accomplish even more important things than the disbanding of the army. We have the ulUinma ratio in our own hands, no doubt, if we choose to acquiesce in the alternative of intestine disturbances, amounting to revolution, and of the general disruption of the empire. Satisfactory, however, as it may be to know that such power does ultimately reside in the hands of our representatives, we are not particularly anxious to see it put forth. The House of Commons is in this respect in the situation of an armed soldier in the midst of an unruly crowd: he can shoot the rioters dead, or thrnst his bayonet into their bodies, but he cannot quietly check disturbance without producing evils more intolerable than the disturbance itself. We do not want extraordinary powers such as are only put forth twice or thrice in the history of a nation, but a system of every-day checks, such as will enable Parliament to keep the military administration in due order, as is the case in the other great departments of State. It cannot be said that the public have interfered before interference was justifiable and necessary. As at present distributed, military patronage has involved us in very terrible calamities. Had the contest been one which must have been fought out near our own shores, or on English soil, the firmest nerve and strongest resolution might have trembled at the inevitable consequences of Horse Guards' patronage. As it is, the corpses of our brave soldiers have been swept into their shallow graves at a distance of 3,00 miles from their native shores. The parade in front of the Horse Guards is as cleanly and as neatly kept as ever. Let us have a few taps on the muffled drum in honour of the illustrious dead, and then obey the hoarse cry from the old building of " As -you were !"
The M.ayors of England, in council assembled, seem to regard the catching of thieves as a sollemn kind of hide-and-seek, in which the party that seeks stipulates with the partywhich hides that the game shall be carried on within certain boundaries. The playground may be a county, or it may be a borough, but there shall be no hiding out of the playground. That is, in plain English, what the idea of a local police propounded by the provincial Mayors comes to; and we must say that, as an idea, we like it vastly. Based on a fine antiquarian feeling--on a noble respect for ancient landmarks, which are too often in danger of being forgotten, the idea comes upon us with all the freshness of a new discovery. Here have we been all this time perplexing our brains and riding our jurisprudence to death, in order to prevent thieving, overtake the thieves, restore the theft, punish the offenders, and, it may be, reform them. What shaU we do with them? Shall we transport them, or imprison them? Shall we try the hard labour system, or the silent system, or the solitary confinement system, or the reformatory school system ? " First catch your thief," utters a voice in our ear, that sounds very like that of DMrs. GIASSE, when in giving her directions as to the preparation of hare soup she said, " First catch " your hare." First learn to catch him, for if he were more certain of being caught he might less frequently run the risk. But how to do it, that is the question; and in these days of discovery we shall be most grateful to the m.an who shall solve the problem. Putting salt on their tails won7t do; notwithstanding the extraordinary currency which is given to that advice, strange to say, it has never yet been followed with success, and we are afraid that the gaolbirds would be caught by it just as seldom as the fowls of the air. The Egyptians, ingenious in aIl that they attempted, had a singularly ingenious method of thief-catching ;-if the robber surrendered and acknowledgeed his theft, he was allowed to retain a fourth part of the plunder. Very clever, no doubt, and highly successful it must have been, although rather expensive, to suit our tastes. WVhat, then, is to be done? Of course, the M.ayors have hit ulion it ;-make a compact with the enemy. Make a compact with the hare that she shall not go beyond a certain circle; make a compact with old Reynard that he shall be reasonable, and not run too far; make a compact with the stag that he shall not go out of the park, and he shall not be kllled, but let off, that we may have the pleasure of another run after him next week; make a compact with the thief that he shall not cross the borders of the county or the boundaries of the borough. He ought to be above that kind of game; he ought to have a little home-feeling and stick to his county; and certainly, if he is a good and well-behaved thief, he will stick to his native place. Has not the Government always recognized in the strongest manner the patriotism of our thieves ? Has it not always regarded banishment from home as the greatest p enalty which a thief can undergo ? Do not the thieves themselves regard it as the severest of punishments ? Why should we treat them as beings who have no such feelings? The fact is it is of the very nature of thieves to have an intense love of locality. This is the grand discovery of the Mayors. If it be true, it is the grandest discovery that has ever been made in criminal jurisprudence, and destined ere long to establish our legislation on the most scientific basis. If proof of the fact is demanded, look at cats; they are without exception 'the most thievish of all animals, and yet, such is their attacbm6nt to houses and places, that it is wenl known they refuse to quit the house when its inmates shift their quarters. Apparently starting with this little domestic fact, which must be known to every wellregulated family, the Conscript Fathers who met the other day at Herbert's Hotel have- pronounced a very decided opposition to the Police Bill of Sir GzonOE Gnzy. Who does not love them for thinling well of their countrymen-for attributing so much good feeling to a degraded and outlawed class? Antiquaries themselves, vini , a retired life in the country towns, seldom moving beyond the limits of the borough, their ambition extending no further than the borders of the county, -these honest men think that the predatory class of the community is as parochial in its views and aspirations as they. are,- and that it is a point of honour-with a thief to confine his attentions to his native district-there to steal, and there alone to skulk. We have somotimes been disposed to deny the possibility of such characters as DomnunBY and VzRazs,who were so amiable in their mode of catching those disturbers of the peace who refused to stand in the Prince's name. "If he will not "stand," says DoGssnm to the watch, "why then I take no note of him, but let him go, and pre" sently call the rest of the watch together, and "thainl Heaven youareridofaknave." "If he will "not stand when he is bidden," chines in VERGES; "he is none of the Prince'a subjects." " True," says DoGBErnY, " and they are to meddle with " none but the Prince's subjects." Incredulous that we were, we find the Mayors insisting on the very same thing. " If the thieves " go beyond the county, why then take no note "of them, but thank Heaven you are rid of "Inaves; thieves that cut across the borders are " no true citizens, no true men of the shire, and the " police are to meddle only with such." While we are mo6t wiUing to do all justice to the amiable feeling which has suggested this idea, it would be premature at present to record our adhesion to the only scientific fact that should give it weight in a practical point of view. These gentlemen may be able to establish the fact that thieves have a strange clinging to locality; that, though they do not regard the rights of property, they have a singular respect for the divisions of topography; and that, in short, as witches and warlocks have no power to cross a stream of raunning water, these individuals have an unconquerable aversion to transgressing the bounds of the parish, and the invisible magic lines of the county. We hope they may be able to prove it, but as yet they have not succeeded in doing so. In the meantime, we may dispose of the only other argument which they bring forward against the Police BiLl of the HosE SErARY. These pleasant topographers are not only extremely benevolent and decidedly scientific in their views, but they have also a strong tendency to politics. Centralization, localization-these be their themes -rather stale, it is true, but stiU words of powerwords to conjure with. The worst of it is, that the Mayors the other dayconjuredvery poorly with these words and talked a good deal of very elaborate nonsense. There is no doubt that as much as possible ought to be left to individual and local action; but it is simply absurd to repeat maxims about self-government aind local arrangements which might have been all verywell 30 years ago, when it took a day's journey to connect two towns that we can now visit in a couple of hours and communicate with in a few seconds ; but which are perfectly stale and useless under circumstances that have made England in effect one large town, or at least one large county, the counties being as parishes, and the towns as houses clustered together. It is all very well to speak of the counties looking after their own roads and tolls, the towns after their own drains and scavengers. These are purely local matters, the interests of one district not necessarily interfering with the interests of the neighbourhood; but the crime of the country must be treated on a much broader principle, and one district must not be allowed to become the refuge of the brigands of another, as Whitefriars and the Savoy in days happily no more. The whole question of police has become too serious to be left under the guardianship of purely local authorities, especially since the abolition of transportation has tied our hands and nncreased the difficulties of dealing with our criminal population. And, if the police forces are to be local in their origin, we do not see why they should not be under a central authority, that would make their movements more economical, more harmonious, and more effective. Our regiments are named after certain counties. We might as well confine their functions to their respective shires as limit the powers and duties of the police to the boundaries of their respective boroughs.

A secondireturn gives the list of prices allowed for the clothing of soldiers in the Queen's service in 1856457, which occupies seven pages. It appears that the introduction of tunics instead of coatees into the army, and the new pattern clothing generaly, already partly taken into.wear, and te bce universally adopted afterthe 1st of April next, has caused a material differenceof price, the tunicbeing, from its excess of cloth, far more costly than the coatee. T'he cost prices of the old and new pattern clothing for infantry are-coats, 15s. Id., and trousers, 9s. 6d.; tunics, 1?., and trousers, 9s. 6d. No comparative statement can as yet be made of the cost of clothing under the old and new system, many of the arrangements made by the colonels being still in force. Unlder the old system these ." clotming-colonew' derived a profit averaging 7501. a-year, and they will henceforth receive, in lien, ixed payments of about 500!. a-year, which will save the country 25,0001. a-year upon that head alone.

I SECOND EDITION, . THE TI.MES OFFICEV, Saurday Moning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. A friend, whose opinions on military and political questions have been frequently before the public, makes the following observations on the present state of affairs:- " Whatever be the remlt of the approaching Conferences you must not suppose that the French Government has in any, degree relaxed its military preparations, which aro continued in the ports of France with the samo activity as in England. We may therefore take it for granted that they will not bo satisfied with iUusory gairantees. Russia will, doubtless, omit nothng likely-to flatter the amour -propre of the Emperor and tho nation. Sho it was vho proposed that the Confer:nces should be held at Paris, and I have no doubt that tho Emperor Napoleon will bo addressed asfrarcby the Czar, instead of the colder term bon ami used by Nicholzs onthe establisoment of the Empire. Louis Napoleon has too much discernment not to know that the French people were no way offended at this exclusion of the Sovereign of their choico from the Imperial fraternity, no more than when he was obliged to select as his partner a beautiful and graceful countess, instead of an ugly and haughty princess. If the French people are not Republicans neither are they Legitimists. If they acclaimed Napo leon by an immense majority, it is because his family, like that of Orleans, which is stiU dear to them, represent what they call tho principles of'89. If they preferred a Napoleon it is because the name recalls the memory of a common glory and common disasters. They will not permit themselves to be fooled by the tardy 'adulations of Russia. The Emperor is well aware of the fact, and he has not forgotten the fault committed by his uncle in affiliating himself with the Sovereigns of old families. He knows that it was his marriage with an Austrian princess that lost him; and that, if he succumbed in 1812, it was for haTing wished to make against his 'brothee' Alexander award arnes courteoises, as he told M do Narbonne, when heourge on him the necessity of re-establishing Poland. The present Emperor is well aware of all that; he knows that his force is in his election, and he wil not renounce its noble principles, nor lower himself by planting his banner side by side with that of families that are worn out and hated. "It may, therefore, be considered certain that France and England wil demand from Russia serious guarantees for the maintenance of the equilibrium of Europe. But in this consists the difficulty, for Russia menaces Europe by its immense population,-a population so superior to that of otherPower-sand by her geographical position. Unwilling to reduce her people and her territory to any serious extent she will be under the necessity of putting a stop to her for. tifing certain places. But it is certain that this prohibition is an attack made on her independence as a nation which will inffict a serious wound on her dignity, and that nothing will be more popular in Russia than the rupture of the treaties containing that prohIbition 'France well knew it in 1814. It is true that she was not displeased at seeing Rome and Hamburg cease to belong to her territory-Rome and Hamburg, whose antipathy to her she well knew, and whose inhabitants she never had regarded as Frenchmen. Neither did she feel much pain at being deprived of Belgium and the Rhenish provinces, and the only places whose loss really went to her heart were Landau and the fortresses which had been hers for a century. But what wounded her more than all was that she felt she was not her own mistress on her own territoryin consequence of the inter. diction to reconstruct the fortifications of Huninguen, andto have gunsatPondicherry. These obligationsLouisPhilippewas askedrepeatedlytobreak through andbrave the consequences and had he done so he would have gained much popularity' We cannot, therefore, conceal the fact that the prohibitions about to be imposed on Russia with respect to the reconstruction of Sebastopol, NZicholaieff, and Bomarsund, she will fedl as a deeper wound on her honourthan would be produced by the surrender of those fortresses or of any other part of her territory. As to Bomarsund it would have been much better to establish the independence of the Aland Isles, under the protection of all the Powers That independence would wound much less the anour proprc of the Russians and would be by far the best guarantee. I To my mind then the very precautions which we are about to take against Russia are likely to render var more probable and less remote. We must carefully consider what will be tho position of Europe when hostilities recommence; nay more, if it is certain that the Grand Duke Constantine, whose warlike character is well known, has declared in favour of peace it is because he considers it as a sort of truce imposed by necessity. If the Emperor Alexander desires peace in order to amehorate the internal situation of Russia, it is not with commerce or industry-that he will occupy himself, but with preparations for future wars. He wiU cover his Empire with railroads for strategic purposes, he wil execute that between St. Petersburg and Sebastopol which has been a long time projected, and which if executed would have rendered impossible the capture of that place. The first thing to be done with a view to war is to maintain and strengthen the offensive and defensive aliance between the belligerent Powers It ought to be wel understood and stipulated that the neutralization of the Black Sea will only last as long as the peace, and that our navy, in time of war, can once more transport our armies on the southern coasts of Russia. As to Germany, whose extreme weakness has been just manifested in sach a manner that not only she cannot offer any resistance to Russia, but sho would assuredly lend her co-operation to her armies to march against France at a given time-for her there is no other guarantee except in the re-establishment of Poland. I can hardly doubt that the restoration of the little Kingdom of Poland, as institated by the treaties of 1815, will be re. quired. The consequence of that concession wil be that an army of from 300,000 to 400,000 Russians shall not con. stantly occupy the centre of Germany so as to completely command it. But wil even that be a sufficient guarantees The Czar being King of Poland wil name his Ministers and Generals. By them he will be able to prepare for war, and should the case occur, it is not probable that the Polish nation will arest the Russians on their aggressive march by an insurrection like that of 1830. The execution of this part of the treaties of 1815, though doubtless exceL lent, will yet be insufficienit. But if the Czar realy renounces all spirit of conquest the surest pledge he can give of his determination to Europe is to restore of himself the throne of the ancient kingdom of Poland, and to place on it, if he pleases, one of his own brothers. Then indeed Turkey and Sweden wiUl be re-assured, and Turkey may be allowed to arm and fortify as much as she thinks proper. Then indeed Germany and all Europe, seeing no longer before them the permanent menace of an invasion will treat Russia as a friend. Then, and then only, Europe wil be really pacified. No Power will be lowered in its dignity, and the Sovereigns wiU give all their attentiohi and care to the progress of civilization and to the happiness of their people." A private letter from Constantinople, under date the 11th February, states as follows:- "Advices from Bucharest are to the effect that the PIench Consul has addressed to his Government a final report on the state of the Principalities, in which he advocates their union under the hereditary authority of a foreign Prince; or, if it be difficult to ftnd a proper person, under that of a native one. It is said that he points out Prince Stirbey as the only person eligible for this high post. I regret that the Consul should be blind to such a degree, bat I am certain that people in Paris must by this time know well who and what Stirbey is. " Here, as you are no doubt aware, the Conferences have commenced on one question. The members are, however, -as yet, far fro n agreed. Lord Stratford has advocated some principles which are in conformity with the wishes of all the honest men in the country. He has even arranged al the principal points, but the Ausirian Ambassador, as well as thce French, will probably loppose them. We are informed that the latter seem disposed even to deprive us of our ancient rights. I cannot say what will be the end of all this, but, at all events, it ought to be ascertained the loss will be counterbalanced by the benefits the new measure wouald impart. "The Grand Vizier leaves this to-morrow for Paris. He asked my advice as to the proper person to be namedPrincee I informed him that in my opinion a better choicoculd not be made than Piince Alexander Ghika who, though somewhat advanced in age, yet possesses aU the energy necess&ry for the Chief of a State ; that he was beloved in the country, and had given proofs of thegreatest devotedness to Turkey." A letter from Bucharest mentions that General Coronini, who had -returned some days, brought the news from Vienna that peace would infallibly be concluded, but every one appeared incredulous, in spite of the official despatches. It remarks-:- "Mr. Alison is still here. ie bas his portfolio filledwith eood information. A fiiend of mine has 'seen him'; hut be was' on the reserve with him, thongh it was easily seen 'that' he 'was well-informed' both as to men and thiDigrin this country. He is thb object of mach attention on the part of Prince 'Stirbey, who is-t ell aware of the real mjssi9nwFtb w#hich he is charged, TAuey are carring on A regular game with each other, and trying who shaU bi;, deceive the other. For my part I am quito reassured as to the result, and also as to the opinion of Ar. Aison with respect to the Govermi;.ent and the Generals." The que3tioST of the article of the Sikle, inserted in the loniteutr, and of the paragraph in the Co,sitionnel of yesterday, stating that the official journal had committed a mistake, is assuming more importance than people suppose. A Cabinet Minister has, it is said, threatened to resign, and the editor of the Coniiioneld no doubt an equany important person, has actually done so. I have already alluded to the subject more than once, but as the matter is looked upon in a serious light, I think it proper to give you the latest, and, as I am assured, the most correct version. It appears, then, that some days back The Times published an article containing certain statements which were believed to lean to the inference that the Emperor was inclined to leau towards Austria, and perhaps Russia, during the Conferences. The article produced aconsiderable, and byno means an agreeable effect on the mind of the Emperor. It occupied his thoughts for a day or two, and at one moment it was expected that a semi-official communication would notice the remarks of The Times. Before any resolution was adopted, an article appeared in the Si&e which was intended as a reply, and which disputed the probability of an Austrian, much less a Russian, partiality. A few days after another article appeared in the Siece, taking to pieces the Russian pleading of the .Tour;ml des Ddbats. The reply to the Orleanist journal was manly, spirited, and patriotic; but there were some paragraphs which were considered to be of a revolutionary colour, and which, moreover, advocated the " restoration of nationalities." The matter was talked over bythe Emperor to thelEnister of State, IV Fould; and he expressed his desire that the article of the Sicle should be inserted in the nonofficialpart of the Moniteur. low, the articlemean by the Emperor (so, at least, the story goes) was not the " nationality" one in reply to the Dgbats, but the previous one in reply to Th7e Times. It was, however, the former which was inserted; it produced no small effect on some of the newly-arrived plenipotentiaries, and it was followed by a fall at the Bourse. It is the misfortune of the Minister of State that people wilZ believe, in spite of all you can say to the contrary, that certain things which occasionally appear in the official journal are not there by accident. I think the opinion is unfounded, but so long as a member of the Cabinet is believed to continue a connexion with the great banking firm of the same name, no small portion of the public will be liable to draw erroneous conclusios. The Emperor was much annoyed when he saw the article of the Si&cle thus paraded in the Moniixer, and, as it were, adopted by the Government, and which could not fail to give offence at such a moment as this. The editor of the ConstitutiomieZ was informed on inquiry by anothe member of the Cabinet that it was by mistake the Moniteuur produced the obnoxious article; and though the former had, it appears, no authority for publishing that fact, yet, beEeving that he had, inserted the denial in his paper of yesterday. On seaing this denial, ML Fould, whose authority is supreme over the Moniheur, got angry, and threatened to resign if a contradiction to the contradiction of the Constitutionnzel was not inserted in the Moniteur of to-day. The counter-contradiction was inserted which censured the Constiftutionnel, and the result is that its principal editor has thought it his duty to resign his functions, and from this day ceases to have any relation with that paper. The matter is to be brought again before the Cabinet Council to-morrow, when it is expected that the Minister of the Interior, in whose department the press properly is, will claim the restitntion of the control which has been ao long assumed by another. The Emperor yesterday afternoon reviewed several corps of the Imperial Guard in the Avenue de Neuilly, where the division of Engineers, the 1st and 2d Regiments of Grenadiers, the '2d Regiment of Voltigeurs, the regiments of horse and foot artil lery, and the squadron of the Waggon Train were drawn up. Before the troops filed off a number of the officers and soldiers who had been wounded in the Crimea received from the hands of the Emperor the cross of the Legion of Honour or the military medal. His Majesty was accompanied by the Minister of War and Marshal Magnan. Count Orloff arrived last evening in Paris, and was received at the station of the Northern Railway by Baron de Seebach, Minister of Saxony, and the attache's of tie Russian mission now in Paris. Baron de Brunnow being invited to the concert given by the Emperor at the Tuileries, could not go to meet his colleague. The first sitting of the Conference is to take place on MIonday, the 25th inst., at the Hotel of the Foreign Department. Count Walewski will afterwards offer a banquet to the Plenipotentiaries, the Inidsters, the Presidents of the Senate and the Legislative body, and the high dignitaries of the Crown. On the 18th inst. Vice-Admiral Trehouart, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean squadron, hoisted his flag on board the three-decker Bretagne, which arrived at Toulon on that day from Brest. The steam frigate Christophe Colomb left Toulon for Xamiesch on the 21st inst., with a cargo of 'var mateeL. The receipts of the Orleans Railway during the week ending on the 11th inst. were 867,657f., or 90,841f. more than during the corresponding week of 1855. The gross receipts since the 1st of January amount to 5,056,178f., being a difference in favour of 1856 of 624,731f.

Every ship which arrives from Constantinople brings a greater or leer number of soldiers labouring under typhus fever, scur or frostbite. The 9oan atXt zoe, 5.3Ac;ie ots,mny rail steam-packet w Jurdain, which arrived on Saturday night, broiught, 127 passengers, of whom eight were so seriously indisposed with typhusfever, that it was found necetsary to land them at the island of the Frioul, under the charge of an officer of the Board of Health. The director of the Sanitary Board of Marseilles is unremitting in-his precautions to prevent the propagation of contagious diseases in the town. - Surgeon Malinouski of the Jourdain, a Pole by birth, unfortiunately died on Monday of c.eterainitiou of blood to the iead, caused,, it is believed, by afi!'etY 5ia fatigue in attending the sick Mis funeral wig Attended by the captain ana crew of the Jourdrt and by all his countrymen resident at Mfarseilles. The Sardinian steamer Italia, from Constantinople the 8thinst., arrivedon Sunday. She brought 103 soldiers from the Crimea, of whom it was necessary to land SD at the lazaretto of the Frioul, in consequence of their state of health. The steam packet Gange, bringing the Constantinople mails of the 11th inst., arrived last evening. She brought 215 passengers. M1any of the soldier being indisposedthepacketwasplacedintemporary quarantine until the Sanitary Boardheld aconsultation. The sick were sent to the Frioul and the Gange was admitted to pratique. An oflicer who arrived by the Gange states that there are 25,000of the French army of the East in hospital, viz., 15,090 in the Crimea, and 10,000 at Constantinople. The prevailing diseases are typhus fever and scurvy. This statement is in some degree confirmed by a private letter received by a shipownerhere from one of his captains employed in the trsanport service, in which he says that there are 4,000 French troops in hospital at Eunatoria. The mortality among the horses in the Crimea is said to be very great. The Commander of a transport, at present in the Joliette, says that of 150 horses he took from this to the Crimea, it was 'found necessary to shoot 100, glanders having broken out among them. General Lelxetf, of the Artillery, arrived in the Gange. He has left for Paris, where he is to take the command of the Artillery of the Imperial Guard. Great astonishment hasbeen created in the city of Marseilles, in general so free from political agitation, by the arrest on Monday last of a gentleman holding a respectable position in the mercantile world. It is said that his arrest was commanded by telegraph from Paris. HIis capture was considered of so much importance that the Procureur Imperial assisted at it, and carried away all his papers. Yesterday his friends having appled for permission to visit him were told that he is confined alt secret, and all access to him is refused, It is said that several police agents have arrived from Paris to make further incquiries. The gentleman incarcerated is known to hold republican opinions, and is said to have expressed disappointment at not having been appointed Mayor of Marseilles after the revolution of 1848, but his views were too moderate for the Government of that day. Trade in 3arseilles was rather brisk last week, particularly in sugars. West Indian raw is quoted at 36f. the 50 kilogrammes, with discount; Brazilian, from 33f. to 34f. MIocha coffee, 80!. the 50 kilogrammes; Brazilian, 65f. Algerian wheat, from 29f. to 30f. the hectolitre; Egyptian, 20!. The following is the return of the traffic of the port of Marseilles during the first 15 days of the present month :-10French ships, measuring 2,061 tons; 4 Spanish, 1 American, and 1 Snrdinin, measuring 1,234 tons, entered from foreign ports; 235 Frenchl ships, measuring 26,570 tons; 99 foreign ships, of which 8 are British, 36 Sardinian, 20 Spanish, 15 Neapolitan, 10 Tuscan, 2 Greek, 3 Austrian, 2 American, 2 Norwegian, and 1 Belgian, measuring 16,655 tons, and engaged in the coasting trade, entered the port; 16 French Bshps, measuring C,375 tons, 3Spanish, 2American, 1British, 1Chilian, and 1 Sardinian, measuring 3,136 tons, sailed from Marseilles for foreign ports; 232Frenchships,measuring 29,735 tons; 9 British, 22 Sardinian, 16 Spanish, 13 Neapolitan, 6 Tuscan, 7 Greek, 9 American, 1 Hamburg, 2 Roman, 6 Swedish, 1 Modenese, 5 Dutch, 1 Hanoverian, 2 Prussian, 2 Ottoman, 2 MIeckdenburgers, 2 Belgian, and 2 Norwegian, measuring 22,350 tons, and engaged in the coasting trade, sailed from Marseilles. A private letter received in Marseilles from Cayenne, dated 7th January, announces that aplatina mine had been discovered in that colony, at Appronague, five days'Tjourney from the gold mine of Aratay6. AUSTRIU. (sMose OJB owN COBRESPronm'T.) VIENNA, EE. 18. Things continually take place in the political world of which the great public know little or nothing, and one of the strangest occurred some 40 years since in a room in the Austrian Foreign-office, which is well-known to every Minister accredited to this Court. In the year 1814 or 1815 a treaty was concluded between France, Austria, and Russia, but Napoleon escaped from Elba on the 26th of Febrmary, and the assistance of "thefond ally" beingrequired, it was agreed that the separate convention should be considered a dead letter. The foregoing circumstance is mentioned, by J. L. Klilber in his great work on "17e Acts of the Vienna Congress in tfle irears 1814 aad 1815," and his statement has been confirmed by other well-informed persons. Some authentic information relative to the export and import trade of Russia during the year 1854 has beenpromised me. Itwill naturaUydiminislitheinterest of any future communication that may be made on the subject, but it maybe well now to state that the war has not entirely interrupted the commercial relations between Russia and England. In 1853 the export and import trade between England and Russia was about 90,000,000 silver roubles, but in 1854 it fel to some 28,000,090 or 30,0(0,000 silver roubles. Tne export and import trade between Russia and Prussia rose-in 1 854 from 28,000,000 to some 38,000,000 roUbles. In a very few days the word Bessarabia will be in all men's mouths, and therefore the following brief account of the province, as given by the Tj'icst Zeitung, will hardly be unacceptable - g' Bessarabia,,a tussia province, lying betweenthe Prath and the Dniester, has an area of somewhat less than 4,000 square English mies, with a population of 750,000 souls and eight large towns, 16 market towns, and 1,030 villages. The province is divided into eight districts-Chotymn Soroka, Jassy, Orhea. Kischeneff, Bender, Ackermann, and KabuL There arefive fortresses, Chotym, Bender, Ackermann, Kilia, and IsmaeL The country is poor in mountains, wood, and water. Dried dung serves for fuel, and water is sapplied by Artesian wells." ' '-The new frontier between Russia and MIoldavis will run along the 'lBnk Forest,'* which takes its name from the river that falls into theDniester, some milesto the north of Bender. This wood, or, more strictly speaking, this woodd chain of hills, begins near Chotym, and ends at the Salt Lake, about 100 English miles from the eaboozucAurc of the Danube. According to the new plan for the 'rectification' of the Russian frontiers, three-fifths ot Bessarabia are to be given to ifoldavia. The territry ceded wouId consist of the whole of the districts of Jassy ana Kahul, of nearly the whole of Ch0tYm, of the hilf of Kucheneff, and of a part of ACkerlnaun. Thc fortresses of -il T-and Ismast are to belong to - dari-." Austrian Statesmen disapprove of the idea of choosing the new ruler over Wallachia and :Moldavia from one of the reiging, families of Europe, because they believe no Christian Prince will consent to become the tribrbaLy of the Ottoman Porte. Austria would rdtoubtless prefer such aman as Stirbey, who is arything but wellinclined to that "cantankercrus" Power, Great Britain. Those persons who are blessed with good memories find it unjus'u tÃ¯Â¿Â½hat Count Ficquelmont should be so very fierce against England, for when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, in 1848, he himself sent M. von lHumnielauer to London to trwat about the cession of Lombardy to SarO.inia. The rich country between the Ticimo c:ud Mincio rivers would probably have been protocolled away had not the Vienna fieedmen t:&,en it into their heads to give, the " Russian iIinister" a tremendous charivari, which so terrified. * Prol3bly tbeWaut forest is neiant. : t oUlin been settled &bou thefortres Whotm.

RAILWAY INTELLIGOCB. LOlDON MD NORTH-WFSTERN. The half-yearly meeting of this company ws held yester. day at the Euston station, the Marquis of 'Chandos, MLP., in the chair. Mr. . A. iSTEWART, tho secretary, read the notice con. vening the meeting, and the minutes of the last meeting which were confimed. The COHAUMAN, in opening the proceedings, observed that the accounts showed, during the past half-year, a considerable increase of receipts from traffic. accompanied with a large diminution of expenses. The additional net receipts entbled the directors to offer a dividend of 21. 12s. 6d per cent. for the hulf.year, or, with the dividend of last half-year, at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. 'At the same time they had set aside a larger amount of revenue for the main tenance of the permanent vay, which they thought was ro' quired in consequence of the additional wear and tear result ing from increased traffic. They had also paid 2,000l. to the Shropshire Union Company under the circumstances which hehaddetailedatthelast3meeting. The applications toParlia. ment in the present sessior had been rendered necessary by an application which had been made some years sinco for ^ line between Shrewsbury and Crewe, which the company were compelled, by a clause in the act, to complete. That line ad originally been cut short by a mile or a mile and a-half of the town of Shrewsbury by the Hoaso of Lords, with the avowed intention of the pro. moters seeking a better access to the town which had been shadowed forth on the application to the Lords. They had therefore gone to Parliament this session fora considerable deviation, which would enable them to enter the town in a better and more economical manner -than had been originally proposed. They had alse asked from Parliament an extension of the time for completing one or two branch lines, including- the Shrewsbury and Crewe and the N rhapton and Market Harborough branches. He attribnted the increase of traffic which had taken place in the past halfyar, to a great extent, to the system of cooperation which had been carried out with moet of the other companies, and especially with the Great Western. Thearrangement which had been made last year with the Great Western Company for working at equal rates had been most fairly and honourmbly carried out by that company, and if there had been anycasual instances of deviation from the arrangement then entered into they had been immediately removed. {Cheers. In the present year some important agreements, which had had the effect of preventing competition, would expire, and he hoped that they would be renewedonthe same or equally fair terms; but he regretted to say that with the Great Northern Companythat had not been the case. The agreement with that company had arisen out of the competition which began when the Great NoTtherr line was opened to places where this andjthe Midland Company before formed the sole means of communication. That agreement, which was a step in the directionof an ultimate settlement, expired at the commencement of this year. Negotiations had been going on since August last for the purpose of renewing and carrying out in a more complete manner Mr. Gladsone's award. They had been carried on with an earnest desire to arrive at an arngement, and with an anxious and proper determination not to give up what was thought to be due by any of the parties. Although thost negotiations had not hitherto resulted in anything, and the state of things which existed in 1851 had recurred, he was not withouthopethatveryshortly those negotiations might give rise to a satisfactory result. (Cheers.) In tho event of their not being able quite to aree upon terms, which, however, he trusted would not be the case, this company had assented to an offer of mediation which had been made by the chairmen of the North- lastern, the North British, the Caledonian, and the Lancaster and Carlisle companies. That proposition had been made on the previous day to the Great Northern directors, and it had been aecepted. (Cheers.) This allusion brought to his mind the cause of the disputes which had arsen between different companies; and he had no hesitation in ~saying that the cause was that free-trade system in railways which Parliament bad at one time advocatedand at another had seemed inclined to modify. In early times, when this line was constructed, and was a large divdends, everyone sought to obtain a share othos large profitsi and the legislation of Parliament from that time to this tad been one course of hesitation and doubt. (Cheers.) The moment that the theory of free trade in railways was propounded there was a complete flood of schemes, of which railway proprietors were now suffering the consequence. Parliament, then, instead of fostenng and encouraging the plans of those who had really laid out their money for thebefit of the_public, sanctioned almosteverv attempt to deprive them of those advantages upon the faith of obtaining which they had invested their money,-and that not for their own private interests, but, as it had p roved, for the benefit of the public. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Cardwell's committee of 1853, among other valuable suggestions, reported that " it followed from general reasoning, and appearedto be established by evidence, that compe. tition had failed to afford to the public the same security with respect to railways which it gave in the transactions of ordinary trade." He had hope after the issuing of that report that the ruinous system of competition was about to be terminated; but we still saw new lines brought forward and fought with the same hostility as ever in Parliament. In spite of the enormous sums expended in Parliamentary contests, nothing had yet been done either to simplify those contests, to carry out the views of Mr. Cardwei's committee, or to give that protection to railway property and that advantage to the public which it was admitted that competition had failed to establish. At the same time that competition had failed to secure those advantages it had depreciated an enormous property to a nuinous extent. The remedy for this state of things rested with Parliament for when the public saw that they must pay for comipetition, that the additional capital spent must be paid for by the public in the shape of higher rates and depreciated capital, then they mightlook for- some hope of protection, some release from constantly-recurring contests, and some greater prosperity for railway interests generally. Hear,hear.) This company had suffered much from competition. He believed that there was traffic for all the lines; but for that traffic to be remunerative it must not be carried on by competition. Competition must be got rid of; and that had to a great extent been accomplished by the arrangements which had been made with different coinpames. une of those arrangements was that which had recently expired between this and the Great Northern Company, and under which there might have been an apparent hardship on the Great Northern Company. That company Lad paid to this and to the Midland Company a sum of 25,000l. a-year, which might apPn at f sight to be rather hard upon the Great Northern, although he thou8ht thatit would bear adifferent aspectwhenthe whole question was fairly viewed. The result of Mr. Gladstone's awrard was to divide the traffic from certain districts in cerhin proportions between this company, the Mfidland, sandthelreat Northern companies; and he believed that the arbitrator had arrived at a result which was singularly accurate. The object of the agreement was to give to the public the best accommodation at the least expense to the railway company, and tho result was that, instead of running duplicate trains to the same points incurring heavy expenses to all the companies with almost empty carriages it was deemed better that the tra'dic should be carried by one company by one set of trains with full carniages. The result was, the goods traffic being almost equally divided by all the lines, that the passenger brafflc was left to be carried by the Great Northern, who consequentlytarried aconsider able amount of the traf0iC which under the agreement was awarded to the Midland and North-Western lines, becaMue they ceased to inocr the serious expenso of run ing trains for an amount of tra diic whic would not justefy that expese. Had they continued to r n those trains theywotldhave efrsed, ehelievcd, 2(,000a. ormorolbutthey would have incurred a great additional expense themselves, while tho expense to the Great Norther Company probably would have been not much less. WVhile, therefore, the whole of the traffic carried would not have been much augmented, the expenses would have been doubled or more than doubled. The Great NTorthern Company, then, had caried the whole of the passenger trafflc, paying to this line 25,0001., but retaining to themselves, beyond the proportion awarded by the arbitrator, an allowance of 20 )cer cent, upon that 25,0001. for working expenses. The Great Northern, therefore, obtained 20 per cent, upon the 25.000., which in their hands was almost entirely clear profit; and the 25,000t. which was paid to this company represented merely the net amount, the Great Northern having been allowved for working expenses according to the agreement. He did not thinl;, therefore, that there was so much hardship in the case as might at Sr*t sight appear. (glear, hear.) In conclusion, the noble Chairman thanked the shareholders for the vote with respect to himself which they had agNreed to at the last meeting, and promised that in future the report should be sent to the proprietors, along with the recounts, some time antecedent to the meeting. (Cheers.) Mr. H.Boomz, one of the secretaries, read the report of the directors:- " The half-yearlg statements of account in the hands of the proprietors exhibit the following results, as compared with the corresponding period of -Last year :-Receipts from passengers, parcels, rnmails, &c., 1854, 788,253t.- 1855, SOS,9571.; increase, 20,7041.; receipts from mere disc, total, 1854, 1,470,51E.; 1855,15 3241,5001 incrceaese, S(1,06. v.orking expenses, 1854, 566,089t. -1855, 553,4341.; percentageof isbTseent toreceipts, 1854, 38 49, 1855, 35 *90 "At the last meeting of the proprietors the directors stated their belief that the measures they had in contem- plation would produce a reduction in the ordinary working| expenses, without impairing the efficiency of the service; and the results, as given dbove, showing a diminished expenditure of more than 1,000L, inu earning an increased traflic of 71,0001., fully confirm their anticipations, notwithstanding that 50,0001 of the increased receints is in mercbandise and coal; the saving being attributable mainly to a diminution in tha mileage and number of fziinc and to a careful revision of the arrangements in the merchandise department. The attention of the board continues to be steadily directed to this subject. Parliament, in the bil for the Crewe and Shrewsbury Rlilwagy in 1853, withheld the power . of entering the town of Shrewsbury and the joint station in the manner originally proposed,- cutting short the line about one mile from the proposed terminus, rendering necessary, therefore, a- deviation of the authorized line and a renewed application to Parliament. A bill has con sequently bsen introduced in the present session to obtain the necessary powers and to provide the requisite station accommodation at Shrewsbury, and also to extend for one yea the time allowed by the original act for the completion of the works. Power is also ouNght in the same bill to extend the time allowed for conractin the works o the Northamptoi and Market Harberough branch- and the board have concurred in'an a lication for; siiandpther in rdhardto Cthework opf the sapatead Junction Raiway. landrequired fortÃ¯Â¿Â½hesaboae libnees,butflittle e endiuraeth yet taken place upon the works, whict - the diecors hava postponed pending the application to:ParEiament for exten. sionef time, The WoIs en the siho4branlch from.

I In the report of the 2Sd of February, 185, it was iati 'mated that the board had conditionlly aranged to take x peciniary interest in the Stockport, Disley, and Whaley Bridge Mailwa ,and snbseeutly to work the line. The agreement be submit to the special meeting, and toe directors recommend that the necessary anction be gven to hold capital in that undertaing to an extent not exceeding 85,000 There will also be submitted to the special ieetthe ament made jointly with the Lancashare and Yor]ahire,fanchester, Sheffield, and Linooln. shire, and lNorth-Estern companies, for leasing the c dale CJanal. Thepropo*on of liability toheo bomne by this; company is very smnaltl,hile the advantages of the arrange. meat will be censideralale. The directors, therefore, recommend the measure for adoption. As stated at the last meeting, your directors responded to the invitation of the North Staffordshire Board, by appointing a committee to consider , the relations of the two companies, with all neccsrypowers ia ithatbehalf; but normeeting hastakenplace. Thechair. man of thbt company having, s his fist step, placed the natter in the hands of the solicitor, and legal pro. ceedings having been instituted, your director6 are precluded for the pr=sent from further reference to the subject. "The North Staffordhire Company have given notice of appliciation to Parliament for the following measures affecting the interests of this company :-A hiUl for amalgamation with the Lor,don and North-Western Company; a bill for a line from Sandbach to Warrington; a biU for a line from Moore to Warrington; a biUl for a line from Garston to Liverpool; a bill for amalgamation with the St. Helen's and Wsirington and Stockport Comanie. iA bill hag also been introduced (in corjunction wit the Cannock Mineral Riailway Company) for a line from Colwich to Wolverhammton. 4 he bill for the amalgamation with this company has been withdrawn; but it will be the duty of your directors to oppose the progress of the renmaiing measures. The boara regret the recurrence of a contest between this company, :he Idland, and the Manchester, Shefliead, and Lin. colnEhire companies, and the Great Northeru compny, which they have done- alld in their power to avoid. Thy still hope this difference may be speedily terminated, by the Great Norther directdors accepting an offer of mediation made bythechairmuen-of-four neighbourincompanies, and which has been unanimouslyaccepted by your directors, and those of the Midland, and Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire companies. " The estimates for further outlay amount to 19,4821., for which the directors request the necessay sanction. "The report of the commnittee of proprietors appointed on the 15th of August Last has been some days in Ith hands of the shareholders. " The reduction in the diridends of this company from 10 per cent. in 1846 to 5 per cent. in 1S55 is attributed by the committee to four principal causes,-viz., 1, Parliamenta7 expenses; 2, branches; 3, great cost of works; 4, compe htion.." The report then shows the increase of competition for the traffic from 1846 to 1856 in consequence of several now railways being granted by Parliament. It states that " it is not possible, except at a few particular points, to prove by tfgures the amount of loss from this wide-spread competition. With respect to the branches, including antees and leases, it may with truth be uged agait the polcy pursued that some of these are attended with lOSs; and it may be held that this is a sufficient proof that the policy of entering into such liabilities was a mistake. On the other hand, it may be contended that, though such branches have led, thus far, to disappointment, yet, that serious as mnay have been the loss from competition, it would have been still greater had the London and North-Western line not been protected by its branches; and that of the amount which they contribute to the revenne of the main line a large portion would certainly either not have existed, or would have been diverted to other channels. From the statement of the half'years accounts it will be seen that the net proceeds are 690,2321. 12s. lid., to which add the balance carried from last account, 6,9501. lI. 6d.- 69Z,1821. 14s. 5d.. less further allowance for renewal of rails, 5^o,66^l. ls. 4d., showing a disposable balance of 640,5161. ls. Id. The directors recommend that a dividend at terateof5tper cent, per annum, or 21. 12s. 6d. per cent.or the last sixiontha, amountig to 592,0041. 7s., eavang a balance of 48,511 14s. ld. to be carried forward to the next half-yeas account. An abstract of the statement of accounts has appeared in Thse T'imr. The CiAA moved that the report be received and adopted. M1r. BENSON seconded the motion. The Hon. Mr. PAxRxER congratulated the meeting upon theappointment of the shareholders' committee of consultation which bad taken place upona recommendation which he had ventured to offer in a letter to the Marquis of Chandos. Although a smal proprietor, he had felt that it washightime that railway shareholders should begin to look after their own affairs, unless they wished their pro- prty altogether to disappear. Att the samne time it was aeir tstate that his property in this company was in a much better condition than that which was invested in any other railway concern. It was but justice to the directors that he should inform the meeting that when he first proposed the appointment of a shareholders' commnittee hehad no idea that the subjects with which he proposed to deal had already engaged the serious attention, and had been to [a considerable extent worked out in detail, by the directors. Expenses of management, extensions, and the augmentation of capital werc the great bughears which he was anxijons to attack, andwhen the committee met he found, somewhat to his surprise, he must say, that the detail of;all those questions had been very carefauy and elaborately carried out I by a sub-committee of the boarditself, which had beenimost' ably presided over by Mr. Moon,'one of the directors. (Cheers.) In conclusion, he trusted that the board would adopt the resolutions which the committee had appended to their report. A few years ago he beleved that those resolutions, if acted upon, would have proved of inestimable value, and even now that they would not be without their advantage. (Hear, hear.) Mr. 1AnDrn,m LP., was convinced that the intersets of the company and of the public- were identica; and that in sroportion as the compny prospered was thepublic well andefectly served. He hadsvpported the appointment of the committee, and he should always do so-not for the purpose of throwing the company into confusion, but in order to suggest to andco-operate with the directors. The policy of the company was essentially one of peace, and every railway company should bear in mind the statement contained in a letter in the money article of The Tims some time ago, where it was eznphaticMy declared that competition had failed, and that the accommodation of the pubZe was the object which must now be pursed. He had always been convinced himself, but now his conviction was reduced to a mathematical certainty, that 7 per cent, might be obtained out of this line if it were 'weJllandjudiidouly maanaged. He believed that 1 per cent, upon capital-or 200,0001. a-year-might be saved out of the expenses of management. (The hon. gentleman entered into leagthened details in soupport of this ProPositiOn, into which at is not necesayto follow him.) He then enlargedaupon the pecnliar disadvantages under which railways b.ad been placed by Parliament, &and complained strongly of the pvassenger duty, the system of rating, and the heavy penalties to which they, were liable in cases of accident. Mr. W, MIAI;s expressed his thanks to the committee of shareholders for the very able and satisfactory report which they had prepared. Maying given notice of resolutions deprecatory of the ruinous competition which had unfortunately sprong up between this company andthe Great N=orthern, he had heard with much satisfaction from the chairman that the differences which had arisen were likely to be amicably settled; and under those circinstanceshe should not disturb any peaceful negotiations which might be on foot by pressing those resolutions. At the same time, he wasstronglyofopimionthatbeforo thepresentdisastrons competition and reduction of fares were entered apon the opinion of the shareholders should havebeen taken. (Cheers.) He congratulated the company upon the im1roved position of their affiairs, and expressed his great satactionthata friendly ariangement with the Great Western Company had been entered into and fairly calried out by both pardies. He suggested that the goods traffic was carried by this and other companies atmuch too lovv a rate, and that, in consequence, the profits which were earned by passenger traffic were swamped by the goods' traffic; and he urged the importance of a complete separaton of the capital and revenue accounts.- MISr. PUNCEMR, repeating what he declared to be the popular opinion out of doors, attributed much of the expenses of management to the circumstance, as he said, of the company having a reckless experimentalist in their locomotive superintendent, and a general manager who, of all others, was the most extravagant. He believed, among other things, that at least 2001. a-week was given asvay in abused free passes. There were great and unnecessary expenses at every station, a uselessly lre staff was employed, and lie believed that there wzas a large amount of whlat might be called " sineemecs." In answver to a question whEich was here interposed by a shareholder, with reference to the dispute with the Great NTorthern Company, The On.IAIIn.e announced, amid considerable applause, that since the commencement of the meeting a memorandama had been signed by himself, Mr. Elli;s, and MEr. Chappman, which also bore the signature of Mr. Denison. The dispute was therefore settled.

M02 ARXJ3Taid CITY lZTELLIGrE -. Fiday Bvci&g. At the opening of tbe.Stock-3rcbange *W3I morning busineus was in pense until- informationl had beea received of tha price at which the' new loan ad-been taken. As loon as it was. hnon.at 3leers. Rothshid had accepted the contrAt at the Government ininkmiim of 90 (their tender having been at 89.1) transactions in Consols for- money were entered into at 91f, being an advance of an eighth on the latest price of last eveningy. . Subscquently the market becanie -weak, and a fall occurred to 90, from which there was only a partial reaction, the closin,&. official prices being 9W; to 91 for money and 9i1 to i for the acount. After resular hours soma bargaing were entered into at a fm-ther recovery,of an. eighth. Tho transactions in the scrip of the ne-w loan were extensive, and the premium ranged between J and 1j, the last quotation being 1 to J. The scrip of the Exchequer funding is a quarter per cent. lower, and left offat i- to J. With regard to the terms obtained by the Government, there was in muny quarters an impression that they are too high, and that those offered by Messrs. Rothschild, and which were about 2 per cent. below the closing quotation of the prenious evening, were of a fair character, according to the experience of former loans. By leaving so-small a margin of profit, it was argued, the Government not only ran risk of having the contract rejected altogether, but of the scrip falling to a discount on the first day, since the Exchequer-bill portion of it has already been as low as 2 premium, although there hma not been, a single cicumstance to exercise am adverse influence. It -was probably a knowledge that the subscriptions sent into Blessrs. lRothschild had been extremely large, amounting, it is said, to 30,0QW,0M0_., which induced the Chancellor of the Exchequer to fix a highprice as his minimum; but there can be no doubt that these snbscriptions would have been 3nuch reduced if it had been supposed that the terms would have been so close. Hence, in any future and larger operation, that eagerness on the part of the public which furnishes the best aclvantage to the Govermnent in all such transactions may, according to some opinions, be considerably dimimished. On the other hand, it is assumed that the conditions demanded are to be regarded as a favourable sign. of th. confidence of the Government iti the results of the peace negotiations, and that the present case is, therefore, an exceptional one. 1Bank Stock closed at 213? to 215; Reduced, 91g- to 4; New Three per Cents., 92; Long Annuities, 34; A.nuities, 1885, 16-; India-stock, 222 to 224; India-bonds, 7s. to Ss. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 97i to 981; anl Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount to par. The demand for money, both at 4Ike Bank of England and out of doors, continues extremely heavy; but the pressure was mitigated this afternoon by MIessrs. Rothschild returnig the large surplus deposits reeeived by them during the past two days. Foreign securities were less firm towards the close of business, sales having then slightly increased. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 133 for money, and 9Vb, i, x, and 94 for the account. The Your per Cent. Guaranteed Stock was dealt in at 99~ and I00i. Tlhe general operations comprised3razilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., New, 93 ; the Five per Cents., New, 100 ; Peruvian Four-anda-Half per Cents., 81; Spanish New Deferred, 2312; Spanish CerEificates, 40; and Dutch Two-and-a"'a'l per Cents., 6_. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was an advanice in the rates upon Amsterdam and Paris. Hamburg was generally regarded as about the same as last post. The corn-market was firm this morning at former prices. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a slight tendency towards a decline. The final quotations on the Paris Bourse this evening were 73f. for money and 73f 3ac. for the end of tlle month, showring an imnprovement of J per cent. The Vienna money-market presents a tendency to heaviness. The contin6ntal letters state that the exchanges continue, on the wvhole, to be wfell mlaintained, althouglh at Hamburg the rate israther lower, and'the charge for discount has advanced to St per cent. It is understood that the investigation into the afiairs of the Royal Swedish Railway, of which the late Mr. John Sadleir was chairman, has led to the discovery that manv thousand shares have been issued without the authority of the company. It is stated, on the authority of the directors of the London and County Banlk, that the late Mr. John Sadleir's transactions with the bank had ceased for some months past, and that no loss will accrue to the company from his recent connexion with it. In the colonial produce-markets during the week the business has, with few exceptions, been of a very moderate character, but prices have in many instances experienced variation. The improved feeling in the sugar-market noticed at the close of last week has increased, and the demand has become animated, although the quantities brought to sale were considerable. Speculators and exporters have purchased freely, but the trade, while buying to a good extent, still act with caution. Prices are now about Is. 6d per c-wt. above. previous quotations. The very extensive quantities of refined sugar taken for export for some time back have re'duced the stock of this class very materially, and the refiners, being thereby agamn enabled to come forward, have also bought to some considerable extent. Privately, a larger business has been transacted in the West lndia descriptions, while in other colonial and foreign a fair amount of operations have slsobeen concluded. Coffee israther dull, thegood and fine kinds of plantation Ceylon alone attracting buyers. A cargo of -Rio, good firsts, has been sold for Trseste at 45s. Gd. per cwt. Theme are no symptoms of imnprovement in the tea-market. At the public sales, which extended - over Thursday and Friday, there was little inclination to operate on the part of the trade, although. on the second day there was a slightly improved feeling, especially for some sorts of green teas. Common congou is mnsaleable. The indigoo sales were brought to a close yesterday, and the result has been gratifying, As compared vith The rates obtained at the October sales, an advance is now established as follows :-For good'and fine rhipping Bengal, 10d.' to ls. per lb., ordinary to :ddling, 9d. to lo1. per lb.; Kurpahs, 6d. to lod. per lb.; and Madras, previous quotations to an advance of 3d. per lb. The quantity sold durin and since the auction amounts to 5,200 chests, 3,200 of *Mehic, it is anticipated, were taken for export, the remainder being retained for home mse. The stocks still continue reduced and deliveries large. Rice has fallen 6dL to Is. per cwt. Saltpetrehas been, dull, but t-day there was a little more inquiry. The following letter- respectin .the 3iIadras Rail way Company states in -a concise manner the - grounds on which the shareholders 'in that under- taing conceive themnselves entitled to ask~ for an increase int the rates of interest garanteed to theem by the East Iudia Company :_ "Sir,-Theremarks in ' our City Article of Thursdy mpon tho meeting of the 31 Railrlway Company give but an imperfect view of the situation of the shareholders under the assned ~uamntce of their stock by the East India Company. 2lie facts are shortly these:- "The railway compan7 by their first greement undertook to raise, andl did raise, half a million of stock at a guaranteed interest of 4A per cent., and in their second agreement they undertookto raise three and &-half millions further of stock at the same rate of 4,1 per cent., or at such higher rateo as might be necessary to get the shares afloat. The second issuowas forbAlf A si1lion at .5 percent.; and the third isse, tle most recent., was for one million at 4- per cent., on which only on,e instalment out of four is yet yaid up.

THE YBW LOAN Ã¯Â¿Â½WD FUNIN( OF EXCHEQUER-BILLS. Lirhe following Appeae in our secona edition of ype3 terdzay -I This morningthere was a numerous attendance oE capitalista at the Treasury,to take part in thebidding,4 for the -New Loan and funding of Bxcheqner.bills. Shortly after 10 o'clock a.m., the hour appointe4 for the business, the gentlemen in attendance, in. eluding Barons Rothschild, Messrs. P. and T. Thoxn. ton, J. Capel, Laurence, L. Cohen, and others, 'wera_ received by Lord Palmerston, Sir G. C. Lewiv M1r. WiLson, &e., on thepart of the GovernmentX The Governor and Deputy-Governor of the BauLwere also in attendance. The proceedings were opened by the Chancelloj of the Exchequer placing in the hands of the Governor of the Bank of England thesealed paper containing the nkinimanl terms which 'would bM accepted. I answer to questions from MIr. Capel, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said That the scrip would be. delivered on The passing of the reso. lutionsby the Houme of Commons; bu t, The Governor of the Bank explained that ho feared the scrip might not be ready on the payment of the first instalment of 10 per cent. ILf that were the case the letters of allotment would be stampe4 at the Bank. MIr. Capel asked whether, in the case of tlie Ex. chequer-bfins, it would not be a convenience to hava the interest made payable at the Bank of Englrad t The Chancellor said it had not been the custo= to do so, and he was afraid it was not possible. The Chaiieellor of the Exchequer tlhen requeste the presentation of tenders. Only one was 3nade, by Baron L. Rothschild, on the part of MIessrs. Rothschld7, Brothers, in the following form:- " We hereby propose to the Lords Commissioner of Her aesty's Treasury to subscribe the sum of 5,000,0001. sterling forthe loanforthe service of tha year 1856, on the following terms - "For every 1001. of money to receive 112l. os. (say five shillings) Three per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, with dividend from Jannary last; the paymnents in conformity with the noticc. " This-proposal is made subject to Paliament auathorizing and directing ourselves and our contii. butors to carry the aforesaid terms into effect." The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked -what thai price would be in Consols. Baron Rothschild intimated that it would be al 891 for every 1001. The Chancellor replied that that was below thI minimnUa price of the sealed paper placed in thI hands of the Governor of the Bank of England and which he requested him to open. The Governor of the Bank of England havin done so, intimated that the terms wer 117!. 2s. 2d. ConsolidatedThreeper Cent. Annuities or equivalent to Consols at 90. Baron Rothschild having withdrawn for a shol time 'with his friends to consult, on returning ar nounced that they accepted the Government inint mnm. Theywereinhopes that some alterationmiJ have been made in the terms for EXcheqTer-bill as the price was much higher than they antic pated. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after consultir wvith lord rabuerston and 3r. Wilson, replie, that the Government could not makce any alter tion in the terms. Having placed the m7tin7iu price in the hands of the Governor of the Bank England, no deviation could be made. The Governor of the Bank said-it nig,ht be well to read the terms again, and did so. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it w not exactly at the price of 90, for they had taki the money quotation, but on the average it iv as near as possible 90. Ir. Capel requested that the G~ofeinunent TwoU in futulre communicationas .to the RStock Exehan state theamount of the loan at once, since it wou appear that parties were aequainted on Saturd: la t with the amount not only of the loan, buit al of the funding, anc had won heavily by bi upon their information. It was then distinct stated that the loan would be for 5,000,000 and the funding for 3,000,0fO1. IN in fuiture, t amount were stated at once, all parties 'would be a position to judgge for themselves, and any pot bility of undue preference would be avoided. ; The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that lie h followed the -precedeut of previous loans. Probal it would be the best course to publish the amount once; but hitherto, durinig a long experience such matters, it had not been the practice. 3Mr. Capel said that he Was told yesterdzy 1 M7limu?tn terms of the Government would be f The Chancellor of the Exchequer smilingly phied-Thatwavas a very good gumess, buttlle %inibm price wvas not finally settled yesterday. . Ater somne further conversation, in answer th questiion from the Chancellor of the E:xchequer, B3aron Ro0thschild intimated that ihe whEole,; cluding the amount of the loan and the Bxee bills, was accepted at the Governentprce. Mr. Capel asked 'what the futnin rate of terest Would be on Exchequer-bills, when called by advertisement for exchange ? The Chaamcellor of the Exchequerieplicd thal; could not answer the question then, lut, the nouncemaeut 'would be made at the usud iperio. proper form. Blaron Rothschild havin, sigued the contreW4 the part of the firn, the proceedings terunated. i
