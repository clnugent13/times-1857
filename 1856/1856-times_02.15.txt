*IPABLIAA[BYTARY INTELUGEYCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, ThuiwnY, Fm. 14. The LoBD CnsejqcELRO took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o"c'ock. Lord ItEDESDALE presented two petitions against the abolition of churclh-rates without equivalent; also, a petition from the city of Worcester, complaining of the blasphemous, immoral, and obscene doctrines promulgated b syclass of persons styling themselves "latter Day kints," and praying that a law should be passed to repress the.promulgation of such doctrines. Lord CAMPBELL observed that there was no necessity [orany new law, as the existing law was suffitient torcvent the publicatiorL of doctrines injurious to piblic morals Lord REDESDALE said, the present petition had arisen from the circumstance of the Mayor of Worcester having refused to interfere, on the ground that Mormonites were Protestant Dissenters. THE FER0OY PEERAGE. The Earl of DERBY, who was most indistnctly heard, begged to call their lordships' attention to a matter affecting the privileges of their Iordships' House. His noble friend had prolmisedtogivehimrnoticeof any petitionthatmight be presented relating to the Fermoy peerage. He had received yesterday a note from his noble friend informing him that a petition had been presented and placed in the hands of the sioble and learned lord on the woolsack, who had by some accident at once referred it to the Committee of Privileges. In ordinary cases the person claiming to vote had to prove that he was the lineaI descendant of some one who had fornerlyb e-xercised that privilege. In the present case no doubt a patent had been granted, which the claimant would bavetoproduce; butthe questionwhichthe Committe of Pri vilegeshad to decide waswlhetherthe patent underwhichhe limed was valid and in accordance -with the law which regulated the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown. He must say, in passing, that he thought it was a singular misfortuneforthe Governmentthat,whereas, sofar asheknew, for centn-iestherehad been no differencebetweenthat House and the Crown respecting the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown, yet in a single year the Government had contrived to involve the Crown and the House on two separate questions, in both of which the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown wns disputed, and in both ofwhich it was proved to the contharytoinvariabIe precedent; and inthe latter case it was quite clear, and not disputed, that an interpretation bad been accd uepon the law directly opposed to that interpretathon which had been affixed ever since the passing of the Act of Union. He would just remind their lordohips of a few facts connected with the question. By the articles of the Act of Union it was competent for the Crown, on extinction of three Irish peerages which had existed before the Union, to create one Irish peer, until the number of peers, exclusive of those who had seats in that house, vas reduced to 100-not peerages, but eers. Almost immediately after the passing of the Act of Union, in 1802, the earldom of hMontrath became extmct, but the remainder to a barony which accompanied that earldom went to a nephew of the deceased peer, and it Vas quite clear 'that at that time it was considered that there was not such an extinction of the earl. dom of M1ontra'th as to warrant the Crown in regarding it zs one of the three extinctions necessary before creatin any new peerage. nlumberless other cases of the same lini had occurred. Various earldoms became extinct, but baronies appertaining to them did not become extinct, although they bad been vested in the same person, and the peerages were not held to be extinct in the sense required by the Act of Union. The next case to which he would refer was the earldom of ONeill, in which case the earldom expired, but a v iscountcysurvived, whichonlyexpired lastyear. Another and a more recent case was that of the late Marquis of Thomond, better known in the House of Commons us Sir Lucdus O'Brien. He could hardly doubt thathisnoble friend could substantiate his claim, if not to the barony of Inchiquin, at least to the earldom. The barony remained in abeyance, but that did not create even a single vacancy, still less did he apprehend that it created two vacancies, and yet.that was the principle upon which Her Majesty's Governmnent were acting, and, were proceeding to act, after a lapse of 54 years. If that principle were aflirned it must follow as a necessary consequence that each individual peer who had died since that time, though leaving successors, must have created as many vacancies as he held titles by separate patents. That would be wholly inconsistent with the intention of the framers of the Act of Union. The intent and meaning of that act was, that peerages should be conferred with the view of reducing the number of peers to l00. By the principle now acted upon the intentionof that act would b%e wholly defeated, and instead of the number of Irish peers being diminished, it would be greatly increased. Last year it happened that three Irish peerages were supposcd to bevacant-that of Earl Tyrconnel, the Earl. of sontratb, and another earldom. Her Majesty's(Govermment, contrary to all precedent, in a few days named 5 peer, in consequence of these three peerages being sup. posed to be in abeyance. Recourse was had to the supposed precedent of the case of the Earl of Montrath, and it wvas for the first time contended, after 60 years, that the extinction of the earldom was in the sense of the words of the Irish Act of Union an extinction of a peerage which would authorize the Government to create a new peer. That was the position assumed. All that he had to say was, that it was the first time that such an interpretation had been put upon the Act of Union, and if that interpretation were good it followed, from the number of peerages of the same kind that had become extinct since the Union, that Her Majest's Government at this moment had the right to create nine or ten additional Irishpeers, saying the very least, if the number of peerages which were held by the same person were to be reckonedias distinct peerages. This was a question of most serious importance - and the case had been referred, and very properly refe , to a Committee of Pnivileges. There was no doubt as to the existing'htate of the law, and the only point for discussion would he Whether the patent was granted to the claimant by the Government under circumstances which were in accordance with, or in contravention of, the Act of Union. This case Was, however, marked by one peculiar character-namely, that there was no party interested in opposing the claim. In ordinary cases, when a person came forward and claimed IL pecrage, the Attorney-General watched the case on the part oftheCrown;butinthiscasethat law officerof theCrown would not do so, because the Crown neither opposed the claimant uor questioned the validity of the patent. 'Under these circumstances, he vwould suggest that some person should be instructed to attend the coxmmittee and watch the case on the part of their lordships, and see that it was properly argaed. He believed thatthe position he assumed was not only in conformity -with the reason of the case, but also with the intention of the act, and in accordance with practice since the year 1S00 to the present time. It vouldlbe for their lordships to adopt or reject the report of the committee; but, certainly, nothing more ought to he done until theFermoy patent had been inquired into in the fullest and am p lest manner, with regard to the state of the law applicable to it, and upon which it was now for the first time attempted to put an interpretation different from thatwhich it had ever hitherto received. Earl GRAILLE said that, although his noble friend vas good enough to give him notice that he meant to make some observations when the petition of Baron Fermoy was presented to their lordships. yet he was not prepared to hear Itis noble friend enter so fuly into the law of the case. But even if he had been aware of it, he beleved he should have exercised a sound discretion in abstaining from arguing a case which had been referred to a Committee of Privileges. 2No doubt Her 3Majesty's Government, acting upon the asidvice of the law officers of the Crown, and also upon the advice of the distinguished gentleman who was Attorney-General under the Government of the noble earl, did confer this peerage in the way described by the noble earl. But, when the noble earl talked so much about the nmusual manner in which these peerages had been given, and of the course pursued being iHlegal, he (Earl Granville) must beg to remiand the noble earl of something that was not unusal in the case of the elections of Irish representa. tive peers. Their lordships knew perfectly well that, whatever mighitbe the qualihication fan Irishpeeratthis moment, however moderate he might be in politics, and however well qualified to take part in the proceedings of their lordihops' House, yet, unless he carried with him the political approval of the noble earl himself, be had not the slightest chance of obtaining a seat in that house. With regard to the manner in which this oestion should be araued before the committee, no doubt the petitioner shouid be allowed to argue it by counsel on his own ibehalf. Tne noble earl had said that it would not be very ratisfactory that the Attorney-General, who had advised aspen the granting of this peerage, should watch the proceedings, and he (Esarl Granville) was told that it would not 'se more satisfactory if the noble earl's own attorney-general were appointed for that purpose; though he was quite smre that neither of those hon. and leaned gentlemen any more than Her Majesty's Government would wish to throw the least cbetacle in the way of having the question fairly investigated and argued. The committee might, he should conceive, come to some understanding with regard to the appointment of some person to argue the case on the part of the House, as well as on behalf of the noble baron. With regard to the supposed analogy between the case of lord Fermoy and that of Lord ensleydale, he confessedhe could not see any whatever. The two cases appeared to him to be as different, as possible. Itwas necessary that Lord Penney, in order to obtain the right oE voting for an Irish representative peer, should have a resolution plassed by their lordehips declaring tht he possessed such nght. There was, therefore, an essential dif ference between the two cases, as no act on the part of their Jordships was required in the case of Baron Wensleydale. The Earl of DERBY begged to disclaim the power and .anfuence which the noble eart had attnbuted to him with regard to the appointment of Irish peers. In the case of the creation of a new Irish peer, that rested entirdy in the hands of the Crown itself, and with respet to the election of Irish representatives, that redeel with the Irish peers themselves. But even if he did possess the inflaence attrinbuted tohim, in what manner, he would ask, could that bear upon the question before their jordship ? The noble earl denied any analogy to exist betreenthis and the Wensleydale case. There might not strictly be any such analogy; but the cases were alike to this cxtent-that in each case the House of Lords aseted the rig to inqusre into the question whether the Hoval prerogative which conferred on the two clain ts a zi tos 5eae in that househad beenexercisedinaccordance wth the law and constitultional precedents. Lord BROUGHAM expresed hisentire concurrence with the Opions of both his noble friends, for, while h consi- two cae, ter* was in one respect, zd that a mostmMSesfsi respect, avayc!oaanalogy betwreen -7n; andthat ans-I IO Cons D liLteSW tW i4s taCmt mittee of Privileges in both instances was the same, and came precisely under the same jurisdiction. No one questioned the prerogative of the Crown to grant honours to any person. The only right contested was the right to sit in that house. The right to a peerage, the right to be called a peer-to be caled a duke, a marquis, an earl, a viscount, or a baron-no person denied that the Crown was entitled, by its prerogative, to confer. The person so ennobled would, to all intents and purposes, save one, have the privileges of the peerage; ha would enjoy the prvilege of freedom from arrest, he 'would have station and precedence, and he maight be a privy councilor; but their lordships bad the right, the imprescriptible right, to inquire into the title of that party tona seat in that house. (Hear, hear.) Be was not one to question the right of the Crown t g enoble by a patent; theqguestion was as to the rightto sit in ParEiament upon a writ founded en that patent. The Earl of DESART vindicated the right of the Irish peers to choose for a seat in that house the man who repre. sented the opinions of the majority. Lord CA3MPBELL agreed as to the expediency of having the case of the Fermoy peerage regularly debated before their lordships by counsel on both sides, and he thought there would be no difficulty in carrying out this object, for the bar was abundantly rich in advocates who would ably discass the question for and against the cLaimant. Between the Fermoy and the Wfensleydale peerages there avas, he thought, a close analogy, and in both cases that H:onse was bound to adjuldicate npon the validity of the patent granted by the Crowrn, professing to give a right to ait in that uestion arose in a different way in the two cases, but it was the same question. (Hear.) THE DOWER ACT. Lord BROUGHIA presented aptition, praying that the law of dower applicable to freehol land, as settled by the 3d and 4th of Wlliam IV., chap. 105, should bee-xtended to and for the fature be applicable to copyholds. The labours of the Real Property Commission had resulted in great improvements connected with the law of real property, and the petitioners caUed upon their lordships to sanction the introduction of an act to effect the further improvement he had alludedto. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, the subject should receive his most attentive consideration, but more he could not promise. Lord CAMPBELL, having assisted in framing the Dower BiD, could state that the reason why that act was not made applicable to copyholds arose from the great variety of customs which prevailed in different manors as to dowers. It was very desiable that the law should be made uniform with regard both to freehold and copyhold estates. EDUCATION. Earl GRANVILLE: introduced a bill for the purpose of promoting education in England and Wales, which was read a first time. The Trial of Offences Bill was passed through committee jIroforim4, in order that some amendments might be iutroduced and the bill be reprinted. UNSEAWORTHY VESSELS. The Earl of EILELMOROUGHE-I rise, my lords, to present petitions from certain seamen of Newcastle, Hartlepool, and others, complaining of being obliged to go to sea inunseaworthy vessels. The subject is one of great importance, for, by the present state of the law, not only is the public interest materially injured, but the lves and properties of seamen are endangered; and I think your lordships will agree with me in thinking that for sach an evilParhament ought to provide a remedy. The statement of the petitioners is, that the casualties at sea have of late years increased in a greater degree than shipping itself, and that statement was no doubt true uhen thus petition was signed. I am happy, however, to say, that within the last few days it has appeared, from the return made by the Board of Trade, that within the last year there has been, a great dimninution in the number of vessels wrecked, as compared with the increase of shipping. In the year 1852 the number of vessels lost at sea was 1,01a, in 1853 the number was 832, in 1854 the number was 987 and in 1855 the number was 1,141. The number of lives lost were, in 18S2, 920; n1853 (893- in1854, 1,549; and in185, 469. Thember of persons whose lives were saved amounted to 1,388, and it is gratifying to know that most of them were saved by means of modern appliances. The number of collisions which have occurred at sea during the past year is 247. Now, my lords, in some cases colisions are unavoidable, but many also arise from causes which it is possible tmo remove, such as imuperfect equipment, or insufficiency of manning, or having teo many foreign seamen on board; and, out of the 247 collisions which occurred last year, a large proportsion must no doubt be attributed to one or more of those causes, all of which, as I have sntetd, may heremoved. But, above all the causeswhich lead to casualties at sea, the main and principal cause is ihat these ships are undermanned. The petitioners state that it is hard upon them that, when they have engaged with the master to navigate a ship, they are compeled, notwithstanding that they may see reason to think that the ship is not seaworthy, to go on board and navi'tc her. They state that cases have occurred in which seamen have believed a ship to be unseaworthy, and consequently haverefusedto proceedinher, and havefor that been treated as deserters, and sent to prison for terms varying from six to 12 weeks, although in reality they had only done what it was their .duty to do for the preservation of their lives. This, my lords, is a very serious state of things and well deserves the attention of Parliament. On the Gth of June, 1854, the bark- Swan left the Tyne for New Brunswick, and in the folowing day put back into Shields. The crew alleged that the master and mate were drunk and the vessel not seaworthy, and, upon the advice of the river I inspectors, applied to the Mayor of North Shields. The Mayor recommended that the agreements should be canceled, and the men paid for the service performed. This the master promised to do, but imstead thereof he took out warrants from the South Shields Court, and the second mate, carpenter, and four of the crew were sentenced to imprisonment for desertion for periods varying from six weeks to three months. In another case seamen had been compeled, by the apprehension of being treated as deserters, to proceed to sea. T e vessel foundered, and the men lost all their clothes, but as they had consented to go to sea they had no reinedy against the master for the loss which they sustained. This, my lords, is the statement made by the men, and it might appear exaggerated, but I have had placed in my hands an extract from the official report on prisons in the seuthern and western districts. Thh entleman who made that report states that in the gaol of :a1mouth there were "Nine prisoners under sentence of 12 weeks' imprisonment for aving deserted their ships or refused to sail in them after having signed articles of agreement, the ground of their refusal having beenthe unseaw;orthiness of the ships, or the fact of their having on hoard an insufficient number of able seamen to work themn with a due regard to the safety of the ships and crews."X That report god'. on to state that "<The frequent occurrence of commitments under the Merchant Seamen's Act in this and other seaport towns has led me to bring the subject under the notice of the Secretary of State in a special report, from a feeling that the administration of the law affecting merchant seamen is attended with an amount of hardship to that class of persons not contemplated by the legislature. A very large number of merchant seamen are committed summarily to the prisons of seaport towns for refusig to proceed to sea after having signed articles of agreement, the grounds of their refusal being, as stated above, the aleged unseaworthiness of their ships, or the insuficent complement of 'able seamen' among their crew. The oorst of these ojetions is in many cases notoriously well foumded moro especaly at the present time, when the great and sudden increase of trade to the Anstralian colonies and elsewhere has led to many shipe being taken up for services, to the requirements of which they areoquite unequal" In another part it goes on to say "Whether the circumstances here alalded to may throw any light pton ay of the numerous mischances that hav occurred of la to to merchant ships I am not qunlified to judgo; but I have the bes reason to know that the prisons of several seaport towns in my district are continuelly suppised with seamen committed under the circumstances referred to; the good character of many of whom, obtained both in the navy sad merohant service, leads to the strongest presumptions in their favour... iwThe above remarsh s apply to all prisons with which I m acquainted in seaport towns; hut in the case of that which forms the subject of this report a peculiar hardship is inouiced on the prisoners by the closeness of consnement and the very defective accommodations." Your lordahips must hear in mid that tho probability is that in moat of those seaport towns the magistrates are shipowners or persons connected with shipping; and, therefore, the seaman who goes on shore to complain of the eaworthiness of a ship may be committed to prisonias a deserter by a person interested in maintainnmg the seaworthiness of the ship. I say, my lords, that that is a state of thigs which ought not to be permitted. By the act which was nassed a year and a-half ago a seam&n is allowed to go a ;ore in order to makeohis compla-int; but it is idle to permuit him to go ashore if, when he does so, ho is to be taken up as a deserter and punished by a shipowner with 12 weelks' imprisOalmefitfor doia'othat Which ititS his duty to do for theprotection of his owln'ife and thepropertyim the ship. By law a seaman may go ashore also, aa survey of thes ship as regar ts the supply of provistons and water, but he is precluded from requiring a survey as to the unseaworthuness or under-maainin'S, of the vessel, which are of inSinitey more importance. (lear, hear.) It must be in the knowledge of nearly every one of your lordslips that it is rare to see any small merchant vessel which appears to have a suffi-i cient number of hands on beard. The number of men is so small that they are a long time weighing the anchor, they can only get up one sail at a time, they can only take in one at a time, and, when heavy weathei comes on suddenly, they are, in consequence, often exposed to the greatest danger. By the last act which was passed npon this subject the Board of Trade has the power of appointing an inspector, but he is only called into requisition after there has been a casualty into which he is to inquire. I desire that the law should be so altered that, in all seaport towns where there is any considerable amount of shipping, the Government should not only have the power of appOinting, but should actually appoint an inspector, whose duty it should be to survey every vessel beforeshedoparted from port. Then the seaman, if he had any ground of coi M t, could state it to the inspector when he went on! Th inspector must be a perfectly unrejudiced u witness, and his appearance beforo a magistrate should be sufficient to obtain a dissolution of the agreement between the seaman and the owner, if he thought it desirable. So much, my lords, for the protection of the seaman and the country from the very serious losses which so frequently occur under the present defective lastem. Las year there were vessels lost representin 170,000 tons, and not less than from 7,000 to 8,000 lives were imperiled. I must repeat now what I said to vour lordships four or five years ago, when the navigation Taws were last discussed, and that ii, that it if ;Iolutely neoe- . sary to introduce into the merchant service the same strin-I gent reglation which exists in Her Majesws navy-that in every case of wreck and every case of serious casualty that there shall be an inouiry. (Hear, bear.) Do that, and, with the prevous investigation by the Mnsrector, you do all that the seaman can s* ;Nd ou prtpen an' 3veg i4 i b 'ruib1 property. I am aware that the subject of wider-mllmxng is not an easy one to deal with, owing to the great demand -which exists for sailors. I am afraid that many who ship as seamen are not seamen, and hence, I apprehend, many dangers and difficulties arise. I am not prepared to offer any proposition to your lordships at present; but that which occur,s to me as proper and desirable is that you should appoint a select commiuttee for the purpose of considering these two points; and I may, very possibly, at an early period, ask your lordships' consent to the appointment of such a commiittee. (Hear, hear.) Lord STAfTLEY of AIDERLEY.-I am bound to admit the importance of the subject to which the noble earl has called the attention of the House, but I think that to a great extent a remedy has been provided for many of the evilsof which he complains. A petition similar to that which the noble earl has now presented has been brought under the consideration of the department over which I preside, and, in order to ascertain exactly what was the state of the law in reference to the matters in question, I desired that a case should be immediately prepared and submitted to the law cfficers of the Crown.: For that purpose several queries were submitted to those learned persons, and I will shortly read to your lordships both the queries and answers, merely premising that we have taken every means in our power to give publicity to them, and to bring them under the notice of seafaring people and of the authorities concerned in the administration of the law. The first question was,- 'Whether, when a seamen is engged, there is or is not dition on the part of I shipowner that the ship sball he seaworthy?"a The opinion was,- " We are of opinion that there is an implied condition on thepart of the shipowner that the ship shallbe seaworthy." The next question wvas.- "Whethier, if the ship is not seaworthy, and the seaman refused to go to sea in her on that ground, he can be treated as a deserter, or punished under the enactments above referred to, or otherwise?P' The answer was,- "If the ship is not seaworthy, and the seaman refuses to go to sea in her on that ground, he cannot be treated as a deserter, or punished under the enactment referred to. But the burden of proof will lie on the seaman; be must establish the unseaworthiness of the vesseL" The third question was,- "Whether, if a seaman is apprehended on the ground of desertion, and alleges in his defence that the ship is unseaworthy, it is the duty of the Court which hears the case to examine into the question, and to receive such evidence as it may be possible to procure of the truth of the allegation?" The answer was,- "If the enaman apprehended for desertion alleges the un seaworthiness of the ship in hisdefence,it willbethe duty of the Courtwhich hearsthe case to examine into the question, as it would so on any other disputed question of fact that might arise before it,;and itmust dispose of the question on such evidence as may be laid before it bearing in mind, as we have before said, that the burden of proof is on the seaman." The next question was,- "Whether, if the ship is not seaworthy, and the seaman refuses to go to sea in her on that ground, and the master and owner refuse to deliver any clothes or effects which the seaman has on board, the seaman can bring an action to recover them, or to recover damages for their detention P The answer was,- " We think that the seaman is justified in refusing to go to sea in the ship on the ground of her unseaworthiness, and may maintain an action to recover his effects if detained." The fifth uestion was,- "Whether, if a seaman serves ins sship which is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, and the ship is lost in consequence, and the seaman thereby suffers damage by loss of his clothes, or by injury to his erson or otherwise, he has any remedy against the owner? The answer was,- " On the authority of the case ' Priestly V. Fowles' (3 L. and W., p. 1), we are of opinion that a seaman proceeding to sea m an unseaworthy ship, and sustaining injury in consequence, could not maintain an action, and would be without a remedy against the owner." And the last question was,- "Whether, when a seaman is engaged, there is or is not an implied condition on the part of the owner that the ship shall be adequately ianned (i. 4, manned in such a manneraswould, under ordinary circumstances, be sufficient forthe safety and proper navigation of the ship on the voyage on which she is to be employed); and, if so, whether or not the non-performance ofat is condition is attended by consequences similar to those which would attend the non-erformance of the implied condition that the ship shall be seaworthy, assuming such last-mentioned condition to exist5' To which the answer was,- " We are of opinion that there is an ha plied condition on the part of thie owner that the ship shall be manned by a crew sufuicient to navigate her with reasonable safety, and that if she be not so manned the consequences wl be the same as though the ship was unseaworthy." Thus your lordshipswill see that we have taken every means in our power to ascertain the actual state of the law. It seems to me that the sailor has a full remedy in case he should be of opinion that his ship is unseaworthy or insuffl ciently manned. What is the usual mode of proceeding ? A seaman is taken before a magistrate by the captain or owner, and accuised of deserting his ship and breaking his en. gagemndnt, and he pleads that the vessel is unseaworthy or ansufficiently manned. It is for the magistrate to take cognizance of the fact, and, having ascertained that the alegation is correct, it is his duty net only not to punish him as a deserter, but also to release him from his engagement. But after all, the noble earl must be aware that it does not necessarily fellow, from the statement of a sailor that a ship is unseaworthy, that she really is so. At the present time, when wages are high and great anxiety is shown to secure the services of sailorswhen there are persons always on the watchto seize men and hand themfromone ship to another--thereis a great induce. men to seamento declare their vesselsunseaworthy and break their engagements. So much, indeed, is that the case that captains have considerable difficulty in obtaining crews with whom they can proceed to sea. For my own part, I do not see what we can do more than we have already done. The noble earl has spoken of a survey; but if we were to examine every ship before she left port if, as would often haPpen, we should have to remove her cargo, we should delayher sailing and thus produce inconvenience and loss to the trade. Thi, too, we are asked to do upon the representation of a common seaman, who, perhaps, wishes to transfer his services to some other vesseL. With respect to another point mentioned by the noble earl, it is true that the number of wrecks was larger than usl last year, but I have reason to believe that the inmrease exhibited by the retums laid on the table the other day is to be attributed in part to the greater care taken in recording such disasters. The noble earl has stated that an inspector should be appointed in every port. 2Row, itdoes so happen that an inspector actually exists in almost every place around our coasts. It is the duty of the Coastguard, the collector of Customs, and some other offi ear connected-with the Board of Trade, to report every caseof wreck which occurs in his district; and, whenever it seems desirable, a further inquiry is instituted by the board. Your lordships will be glad to learn that, although the number of wrecks has increased, the loss of life has been very much diminished, which I believe may be attributed partly to the good effect produced by the recent alteration of the law relating to merchant shipping, by which salvage is allowed for the preservation of life as well as of property, and partly to the power vested in the Board of Trade to give rewards for conspicuous exertions in the saving of life-rewards which were given last year to the amount of 1,2371. If your lordships deem it desirable that a committee should be appointed to investigate this matter, I shall offer no objection; but 'I hardly think the additional information to be acquired would justify such a proceeding, especially since the noble earl has shadowed out no improvement or alteration of the law, with the single exception of the establishment of a survey-a proposition which is worthy of consideration, though I cannot pledge myself to adopt it. Lord COLCRESTER wished to refer to one point onlythe power of a seaman, when caOled before a magistrate for desertion, to prove that his ship is unseaworthy or insufficiently manned. He complained that under the law as it stood the onus of proof was laid on the seaman, who in many instances had not the means of substantiating his case by evidence. It seemed to him that the duty of ascertaining the seaworthiness of a ship should be performed by Government inspectors, armed with sufficient powere. At'presentthe insmectors were empowered to enter ships in large ports only; he would suggest that their powers should be extended to every port; great or small, in the kdngdom. A survey of the same kind had been carried out abroad with good effect, and he saw no reason why it should not be adopted here. He concluded by thanking the President of the Board of Trade for the trouble he had taken to ascertain the state of the law. The Earl of ELENBOROUGH, in corroboration of what he had said, would refer to the case of the Swan, which two days after sailng returned to port in consequence of being in an unseaworthy state. The fact of her coming back proved that she was unseaworthy, and yet the seamen were treated as deserters They went before a magistrate and complained by petition, though in somewhat technical language, of the unsafe condition of the vessel, yet, notwithstanding this, they were sent to prison for 12 months. Had the noble lord been a seaman on board this vessel he also would have been sent to gaol for 12 months. (A laugh.) Lord STANIEY of ALDERLEY thought that in this instance there was aprisaifacic case in favour of the vessel being mnseaworthy, and the magistate shonld therefore have made more inuiry. [Lord 'LLEN EOROUGH.-" Bat he did not."] Probblvthe case occurred previously to the publication of the opiaion of the law officers of the Crown which he had read, the effect of which had been to cause greater attention to be paid to the complaints of seamen. The Earl of ENIEB OROUGH thought the noble lord must have forgotten that he had read a passage from the report of the Inspectorof Prisons, writtenm 1855, in whichhe made a statement of exactly the same tenor with that put forth by the seamen. He stated that nine out of every 10 persons summarily convcted in his district rwere seamen for deeton. Lord STANLEY of ALDEEMEY said, the Inspector of Prisons could know nothing personaly of the cases of those seamen-he had no means of knowing whether the vessels to which they belonged were unseaworthy or not. Their lordships adjourned at half-past 6 o'clock.

Mr. OLIVEIRA wished to ask the Under-Secretary for War whether the increase, promised in 1854, for the admission of children of non-commissioned officers and soldiers to the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea had been carried into effect? Mr. PEEL believed that additional accommodation was now provided for the reception of these children, who would therefore shortly be admitted. STEAM COMMUrICATION WITH AuSTRALrLA Mir. BAxTER begged to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonial Department if Her Majesty's Government were taking steps to re-establish steam communication between this country and the Australian colonies; and, if not, what were the obstacles which prevented them doing so7i Mr. LABOUCHEPE.-I am in hopes that the Government have taken steps which will be effectual in placing the postal communication between this country and the Aus tralian colonies upon a satisfactory and permanent basis. (Cheers.) The details of that arrangement, are fully ezplained in a Treasury minute which has been distributed this morning, and the House will, therefore, not expect me to give more than the outlines of the plan. Tenders were issued for a monthly communication between this country and Australia, half the expense of which will be borne by the mother country, and half by the colony. Steamers are to touch at King George's Sound, Melbourne, and Sydney, and there will be branch services for Port Adelaide, Van Diemen's Land, and New Zealand. CAMP AT ADTERSHOTT. Mr. STUART wished to ask the Clerk of the Ordnance whether the huts designed for schools and libraries at Aldershott were likely soon to befit for use, theyhaving now been in progress since the month of October; also, when the church in the north camp at Aldershott, commencod in the month of August last, would be opened for the troops? Mr. MONSELL said that the huts for the libraries and schools had been ordered, and would be almost immediately occupied. The church in the north camp was out of the hands of the contractors, and was now ready for occupation. POSTAL COMMUIICATION WITH BRITISH GUIANA. Mr. LINDSAY begged to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies if he received a memorial from certain inhabitants of British Guiana complaining of great irregularities in the conveyance of the mails between this country and our West India possessions, and praying for an inquiry into the same; if thisamemorial hadbbeen received, and what steps, if any, had been taken to insure for the future thec regular erforance of the contract entered ito by the West India Oyat ea cmpacket Company; and if the Secretary for the Colonies would lay the memorial, with any correspondence bearing upon it, on the table of the house ? Ir. cABOUChERE said that a memorial had been reoeived at the Colonial-offlce from British Guiangi and there iould be no objection to lay the correspondence on the table. It was true that irregularities had taken place in the conveyance of the mails; but it was only just to the comany who had charge of the postal communication with the west Indies to state that the irregularity had been mainly caused by the Government having been obliged to take te larger vessels of the company and employ them for the transport service. The result was, that the smaUber vessels had been overburdened, accidents had occurred, and irregunlarities hadtaken place. Since last September, however, these postal communications had been carried on with regularity. COM HISSIONS RI THE AR.IY. Tr. BIAND inAuired whether it was intended stll to restrict the distnrbution of commissions without purchase in the armyto youths under 18 years of age and officers from the militia with the quota ofvolunteers, or if any change was contemplated. Mr. PEE.-There is no rule that of ficers must be under 18 years of age on first receiving a commission in the army. There isa rule, however, that those who are abeve that age cannot be entered on the list of applicants for commnissions' without purchase. But the time frequently elapses before the commission is granted, and it not unfrequently occurs that officers are past the age of 18 when they are actually appcointed. A fewv excephions are also made in meritorious cases, as where the fathers of applicants have been killed in action. With regard to ensigns from the militia with the quota of volunteers, they are appointed withbout any very stricb inquiry being made as to their age. TSE ARMIISTICE. CONTRABAND CARGOES FOR RUSSIA PORTS. Mir. J. EWART.-I w,ish to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether it will be lawful to despatch British ships with cargoes to Russian ports during the armistice which is about tobe concluded? and, in that case, would artiles contraband of war-such as brimstone, lead, and saltpetrebe exempt from such permissions of shipping ? If the sailing of British ships be unlawful, might foreign ships be chartered for the purpose, or whether the blockade of Russian ports will be soon re-established ? Lord PALM.1RSTON.-I should strongly recommend any persons who may wish fo engage in such undertakings 'as are described in my hon. friend's question to wait until they see whether an armistice is concluded, and, if so, what are the nature and conditions of that armistice. (Cheers and laughter.) DUTY ON FMEE INSURANCE. Mr. SCHOLEIELD bad been informed that a fire insurance-office, having its centril office i.n France, had held out an inducement to persons in this cournlry to effect' insurances against fire with them, by promising them an exemptionfromthopolicystainpandinsuranceduty.HewishleX to know whether the attention of the Chaicellorof the Exchequer had been called to this subject; as it affected thq Insurance companies of this country and the revenuw4J (Cries of " Hear.") 'The CHANCELLO R of thieEXCHEQI r.-My atteil tion has been called to the subject to which my hon. friend has adverted, with reference to an insurance office called a lZrance, established in France. My belief is that up '' the~ pxe-sgflt hmnioi evsootewueryng leeCd friend b,ad explained in elaborate detail the scheme which he priposed, but had, he (the AttorneT-General) thought t^^en too much credit for originality, for the plan was no other than that which the Statute law Commission was now, and had been for some time, acting upon. He Was quite sure his hon. and learned friend intendadtobring his great knowledge and ability to bear upon a most useful objec, bhut he (the Attorney-General) did not exactly see whether his hon. and learned friend was to be regarded as the organ of the Statute Law Commission, or whether be intended to undertake individual action upon that subject in that house. He did not wish to give to his hon. and learned friend, considering how many years he had been a member of their cormnon profession, too much credit for modesty, but he asunmed the hon. gentleman did not intend to arrogate to himself a merit which did not belongto him. There did not appear to be anything in the plan which had been detailed by the hon. and learned gentleman differing from that upon which the Statute Law Comnmisbion was now proceeding. He (the Attorney. General) was a member of that commission; but was not aware that tlhe hon. and learned member for Suffolk was entitled to speak on behalf of that commission. It might be so but he certainly was not aware of it. He was not at all desirous of vindicating the merits of that scheme as adopted bv the Statute Law Commission, for the simple reason that he did not think it was a good one. He was of opinion that the consolidation of statutes should be con& eon a far more comprehensive sstem. (Hear, hear.) In his judgment, if they were to continue to proceed upon the principle advocated by the hon. and learned gentleman, so far from completing their work in two years, they would not complete it mn two centuries. If they were to take the statute 'law bit by bit, he believed they would never get through it so long as they might live. He considered that there should be made, first, an epitome and complete outline of all thelavws, dividing them into great compartments; then subdividint them into the various chapters or heads to which the su jects naturaUy belonged; andthen,having this outline,to arrange all the stattes under the various heads. The laws relating to personal rights, the laws of children and parents, masters and servants, guardian and ward, the laws of shipping, and police offences should be cmbodied, and all the statutes ranged under their various heads, and dealt with simultaneously. If the work was attempted to be done in the fra mentart manner proposed by the hon. and learned gentTeman, ho believed it would not be successfnUll accomplshed. With these views y he stood in the Statute Law Commission not quite alone, for his hon. and learned friend the Solicitor-General agreed with them, but in a minority. However, he was glad that a geatleman of the transcendent ability of the hon. member for Suffolk had come forward upon so iLmportant a subject, ;and, so far from opposing the introduction of the bill, he hailed it with satisfaction, anv wou,ld willinglyrne any assistance mn his power, either as a member of the Government, of the House, or of the Statute Lawt Commission, in furtherance of the great object in view. (Hear.) |Mr. WORTLEY expressed his gratification at the step taken in law reform by the proposed consolidation of the statute law. He was quite as much in the dark as the Attorney-General as to whether his lion. and learned friend the member for Suffolk appeared as the organ of the Statute Law Commission or as an individual and distinguished member of the legal profession; but it was greatly to the advantage of the country tohave agentlemanwithhisability, perseverance, and energy pledged to commence and carry on the great task he Mad referred to. He (Mr. Wortley) believed that his hon. and learned friend would find the task not so overwhelming as had bsen supposed, though it would have been so had his learned friend undertaken the duty suggested by the Attorney-General. He admitted the superionty of the principle laid down by the Attorney-GeneraL He believed that if they could take a wide and comprehensive view of the whole of the statute law, subdivide it and analyze it, classify the several parts under proper heads, and arrange it into a perfect system, that would be infinitely better than the present proposal But by what machinery was that to be done? In this country there existed a form of constitntion which made it difficult to take that course which was taken under the great Napoleon, and might be taken under a despotic Govermment. The question then was, what was practicable under our constitution and according to our methods of legislation ? It was much more likely that bills might be passed on specific sub. jects, and relating to specific divisions of a subject, than that any large measure embracing the whole of the statute law could be carried. He rejoiced to hear that the hon. and learned member for Suffolk proposed to confine his efforts entirely to consolidation, ana not to attempt codification, and it was with regret that he listened to some observations which fell from the noble member for King's Lynn, seeming to intimate an intention of going further. Consolidation was perfectly practicable, and had the advantage of raising no new questions - but the moment codification was attempted there would have to be encounterednot only the difficulty of defining terms and principles, but every enactment would raise a host of new questions. (Hear, hear.) He congratulated his hon. and learned friend on the endeavour he was now making to simplify the statute law, and for his selection of the important part of the law relating to offences against the person. Hf it were scandalous that the law on any ordinary subject should be found scattered through many statutes, it wras particularly so with respect to a subject affecting life and the security of the person (hear, hear), and he therefore rejoiced that this attempt at practical legislation for the removal of such a scandal was made. (Hear, hear.) Sir F. KELLY, in reply to an observation which had fallen from the Attorney-General, begged to state distinctly that he was not the organ of the Statate Law Commission. He stood there as an individual and independent member of Parliainent. It was trne that for the last few weeks he had been a member of the commission, and had attended its meetings, and that he had the entire sanction and approval of all the members present at those meetings, among whom he could not number either the Attorney or Solicitor General, for what he now proposed. He could only add that for him to attempt to carry these measures through that house without the aid which that commission couild afford, under the sanction and direct authority of Government, would be to make an attempt which never could have a satisfactory result. (Hear.) lfr. J. PHILLIMORE said, he had heard with regret the hon. and learned gentleman the member for Buteshiro repeat all those arguaients against codification wlich he had magined to be exploded. That hon. and learned member, as well as the hon. and learned member for Suffolk, seemed to forget that this country, in being without a code, formed the single exception among nations having attained a high degree of cvilization. He ventured to say that in making a code for France more difficulties and anomalies by a hundredfold had to be encountered than would be met 'with in executing a similar task for England; and, so far from evils arising from that codification, there was not a country in Europe where the Code Napoleon was adopted that did not regard it as the greatest blessing. In the Rhenish provinces Prussis, all powerful as it wvas, could never in,duce the people to give itup. (Hear, hear.) It would be easier to draw up a codo for England, because in this country there was less contrariety of customs to reconcile, and when it was said that codification could only be done by an absolute Govement, he referred in refutation of that statementto America, andto the code of Louisiana. To condense and methodize our laws required industry, and nothing more, and it was with regret that he saw any measure tending to postpone that great object, or to make people think it was a hopeless task. The same aismnents which were now used against codi'ication i this country had at one time been used also in France. The objections raised to the code drawn up by his learned friend Mr. Greaves certainly reflected no credit on their authors. There always must be a vast mass of unwritte:s jurisprndence, and the great object was to reduce all uncertainty within as narrow limits as possibln. It was an observation of Lord Bacon, that if the laws were to accumnlate and to grow into such a vast mass, and to labour under such great confusion as to be unintelligible, the great object should be to adjust and methodize them. " Onus iwusemod4" said that great man, " opus keoicuns est." He hoped that this OpU5, Ac-oicun might be accomplished by his hon. and learned friends below him, and the sooner it was set about the better. Sir G. GREY thought that the discussion to-night and the debate of the other night on the motion of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Dublin confirmed the observation of the Attorney-General, that, after all, therc was very little difference of opinion as to the extent of the inconvenience and evil arising from the present state of our statute law. He was only afraid that, while they were agreed in this, the'y would be deterred from aling any step in advance by a difference of opinion as to what was the best step to be taken. The advantages of codification were undeniablc, but many very sensible objcetions had beennrged to showthatto combine it with consolidation would not provide aremedy to the evilcomplained of- Ashaa been stated by the Attorney-General and the hon. member for Suffoll, classification, or consolidation, should precede, but not supersede codification-the order should be consolidation first and codification afterv.-ards. There were different opinionsastothe manner in which consolidation should be effected. The course now proposed to be pursued by the hon. and learned member for Suffolk was, as he understood, recommended by the Statute Law Commissioners ; and the hon. and learned gentleman, without representing himself as the organ of the commission, had fully and fairly acknowledged that he had received the greatest assistance from the members of that commission, and from their sta., in framing these bills. The Attorney-General had stated his objection, as an individual, to this course, but the Lord Chancellor had given him to understand that he enf- tirely approved it, and, that these bills had been' considered by the Stitute Law Commissioners, and had, in fact, been prepared in conjunction with them. He could not do better, therefore, than to recommend the House to agree to thd proposition of the hon. and learned member; and, as the Attorney-General, notwithstanding his difference of opinion, had said, the best assistance of thc Government should be afforded him in his attempst at con- solidation. His own opinion was, that this mode of pro'cceding was the most likey to lead to immediate progres They were more likely to advance by taldng the statute law, subject by subject, and consolidating each subject successively, than by waitin til they could have a complete consolidation of the wiole of the .statute law. Tho hon. and learned gentleman had rather undervalued, he thought, thedifficultywhich would be experienced after consolidations in keeping subsequent legLslation in harmony with it;. but that, certainly, wss no reason why they should iabstain altogether fromn attempting consolidation. Perhaps the best remedy for this difficulty would be periodically to 7dpuhlish the statutes, and in' every newv edition to insert aisects which had been -~passed einseethe last, each coneateud acntd CaessiHied with preceding legislat'ion on the - f. L KING congratulated the law reformers on the =eccesion of so valuable an adherent as the hon. and eaned member' for Suffolk 'IIe could no' agree awith the lion, and learned meber that the Statute Law Commission had beero.f any great service. In 1853 they were set to work '*ith a plan laid down by the Lori Chancellor; in IF,5 they hsd discharged all the working men who had bcen employed in carrying out that gan; and i:n 1855 they had no p$au whatever. neb iSeved that the system of consolidation proposed would be SAding to the confusion which already existed. Were the plans suggested by Bacon, Hargreave,- and others adopted, it would purge the statute-book of 10,000 and odd acts of Parliament, and a great deal of useless lumber would be do.ne away with. The mode of amending acts -of Parliament had been alluded to. On that subject he had himself proposed a plan which he hoped would be considered by the hon. and learned gentleman. It was that acts of Parliament should be amended very much in the same way as bills were amended in committee-by altering such parts of the act as were intended to be changed, and by omitting such words as would be no longer necessary, and then having the bill printed in that form and no other. This wouldprevent muc unnecessary debate by confining the discussion to those parts only of the act which it was proposed to amend. Mr. BAINES said, in consequence of the observations which had been made upon the hne of policy that the Lord Chancellor had adopted with regard to statute law revision, he thought it was but a simple act of justice to that noble and learned lord to state what that line had been from the beginning. The priciple which the Lord Chancelor laid down was to take ai the statutes relating to some one subject, and to consolidate the law upon that subject-not to alter the law, but to bring aU the straggling acts into one bill. The noble lord had in the Statute Law Commission worked upon that principle from the beginning. The law of landlord and tenant, of master and servant, and that relating to ecclesiastical leases, which was now very widely scattered, had been made the subjects of consolidation by the commission. Bils were in a state of forward preparation on those andtwo or three other sabjects, and which he trurted would soon be laid before Parliament. The Lord ChanceUor also contemplated bringing in ahbiU at no-distant time upon the subject of copyholds. He fully concurred with the views expressed by his hon. and learned friend the member for Suffolk, and thought he was perfectly right in the limitation he had given to his measure. Whether, after consolidation had taken place,theLeislature should proceed to codification was a question on which very considerable difference of opinion prevailod in that house. But, whether they were or not to take that further step, all must agree that the step they were now invited to take was a good one. It would be good if they stopped at consolidation, and it would be good if they proceeded to codification, because by the present measure they would have laid up stores of useful materials for the ulterior work. In consolidatinig statutes two different plans had been acted upon at different times. There had been consolidation and amendment of the law combined. That plan had been carried out with considerable success. The most .remarkable instance was that afforded by the measures of Sir R. Peel in 182G. He brought forward and succeeded in carrying into law three most important statutes bearing on the subject of cri minal law. In the year 1831 Lord Melbourne, then Secretary of State for the Home Department, brought in a bill consolidating the whole law on' the subject of offences against the person; and his lahbours were attended with great benefit. Since then' there had been many other instances of legislative success in the same direction; among them was the measure introduced by his right hon. friend the member for the city of Oxford for consolidating the law relating to shipping-a measure of greatadvantage not only to the shipping interest, but to the country generally. Those and othier measues were acts in which consolidation and amendment were connected, and with great success. But he must confess, notwithstanding, he was clearly of opinion that the hon. and learned member for Suffolk was right in confining his task ply to a consolidation of the law. Were he to embark on the task of emendation as well, it would be impossible to say when lils labours could be completed. He trusted the House would give his hon. and learned friend their cordial support. Mr. MSMA HON, referring to the course which had been taken by the Legislature of New York in the appointment of a commission which, in the short space of three years, consolidated the whole of the statute law of that State, said that, in his opinion, it would be a most economical expenditure if a vote of 10,0001., 15,000M., or even 20,0001. were appropriated to a similar work in this country. Mr. NAPIER announced that, if by the time that the House reassembled after the Easter recess the Government had proposed no plan in conformity with the resolution which he brought forward on Tuesday evening, he should again eall the attention of the House to that subject. The SOLICIOltI-GENERAL should have been extremely glad if, before introducing this biU, his hon. and learned friend (Sir F. Kelly) had had an opportunity of consulting an exeedingly aluable paper that had been laid before the Sttute laww Comminssson, and which, he trusted, embodied the outline of a scheme which, when it had been a pproved by the commission and was submitted to the House, his hon. friend would recognig as including al, and more thau all, the objects which he sought to attain. He (the Solicitor-General) now rose in justice to his hon. and learned friend the Attorney. Genera and himself to explain in what they differed from the Statute Law Commission, and what object they had had in view. The difference, as appeared upon the papers before the House, was simply as to the mode of selecting the subjects or heads to which the satutes to be consolidated should be referred. He himself desired that that selection might be made in accordance with some system of analysis; and he did so in the hope that it might lay the foundation for a future great work-the work of codifying the law. (Hear, hear.) The Statute law Commissioners, on the other hand, said, " Let us talce a subject, say that of executors and administrators, collect the numerous statutes relating to it, and embody them into one law. The objection to that was. that the statutes relating to this subiect involved enactments relating to real property, including freehold, leasehold, nd copyhold estates; others relating to personal property; and others relating to partnership; so that, when you had got your consolidated statute, you had put together a c21mlutus of fragmentary parts, all certainly ranking under the head of executors and administrators but having no further connexion with each other. His preposition, therefore, was that the titles or subjects should bre selected with reference to an analytical division, so that each branch of the law might find its proper place, and the law of real might not be mixed up with that of personal property, or laws relating to property with laws relating to personal duty. All that was desired by himself and his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General was, that this analysis should be made the groundwork on which the selection of the subiects or headsof the consolidated statutes should proceed. That was not acceded to by the body of commissioners; and, as he and his hon. and learned friend were insa minority. hewasboundtoadmit, and undoubtedlI did admit, that they must have been in error; although they were not at the tine enabled to discover in what that error consisted. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) So far as the argument was concerned, he should stil be glad that the consolidation should proceed on that analytical method; and he much regretted that the first time an attempt had been made to introduce into the arrangement of our law anything like a philosophical analysis it should havebeen opposed and defeated, and that we were to have an arrangement and consolidation of statutes without any order, and without anything like a proper division and distribution of subjects. As to codification, he admitted that there might be great difficulty in expressinginwriting the great, expansive, general principles of the common law; and no man would attempt to lay down aules which should define their application; but, with that exception, there was no more difficulty in reducing the law of England-whether it were the statute law, or that which was called the common law, and was collected from cases and decisions-to a system than there was in writing a treatise on any branch of the law. (Hear, hear.) A treatise upon any part of the law set forth the rules upon that subject which were laid down in statutes, or which might be collected from reports. Such a treatise was pro tanto a species of digest of the law; and that which was done imperfectly in a book might by experience and atten-tion be done in a much more perfect manner, and niight result in a complete digest. It would not be more dificult to codify the law of England than it was to reduce to a system the complex elements of the legal system of Rome; yet these were by the celebrated Digest brought into order, simplified, and arranged under titles, and. formed a body of law which was at the same time the great authoritv of aU jurisconsults and the most remarkable repositoryof the power and civilization of the Roman empire. Let no man, therefore, despair of the possibility of approaching a state of things in which the law of England should Present something like order, arrangement, and analysis. He was ouite of opinion that the consolidation of the statute law was the commencement of that work, and he therefore welcomed in the most cordial manner the assistance of his I hon. and learned friend the member for Suffolk (Sir F. Kelly). At the same time, he must be permitted to express the great pleasumr with which ho had listened to the very statesmanrlike and philosophical speech of the noble lord the member for King's Lynn (Lord Stanley). (Hear, hear.) These were powerful auxiliaries; and although that Hrouse washardlythe proper arena for discussions such as had taken place that evening, he trusted that, before the close of the session, hon, members would see cause to admit that by thle bills which had been introduced much had been done for the cause of law amendment. (Hear, hear.) Sir F. RELLY, in reply, said, it had been made a matter of complaint in the course of this discussion that he had not brought forward a strictly analytical plan to accopisplish the object he proposed. Now, if his hon. and learned friends the Attorney and Solicitor General would be good enough to furnis h with's -atalogue of acts in the order in which they tought consolidati-on- o-ug9h-t to be effe-cte-d-anda-i-f he considered it mnore expedient and practicable than the order-which he had selected, he woulfundertaketoadopt their suggestion as soon as it was made. But then he had been met with the general objection that he ought to' have attempted codification, and the hQn. and learned member for Leominster (Mr. J. G. PhiDimore) had addressed the flouse as though he (Sir F. Kelly) were an enemy to codification. Now he was as much in favour ofcodification, if its practicability could only be established, as any gentleman present; but he would remind the House and the hon. and learned member, with 3egard to thePandrcts of Rome and the Code 21aoieon, that Justinian and Napoleon were both absolute monarchs; and that their will at once became law. Let the hon. and learned member bing in a bll for the codification of the law on any one subject, and ho would gladly assist in carrying a bill; ht he believedthoe hon. and learnedgentle, man woold fmd that the very flistpropbsition in any bill- of the kind would be met by such oppoaition and by such difference of opinion as would be fatal t c its progress through Pairlament. In-the reantimehe haddnlyearnesly to thank the H[ouse for the attention they had been pleased to bestow upon his plan, which-he would do hsbs oc forsvard, and to assure them that he would rec7eiv&with -thankefulness any suggestions that could be made with regard Leave was then given to introduce the bill BlLT OF EXCHANGE DAND PROMISSO8Y NOTES. #WBYE ILY:thien m'wyed for leave to b-ing ini a bll to

I LONDON, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 185.3 The House of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock A conveisation took place on a point of privilege involved in the recent creation of an Irish peerage, the Barony of Fermoy. The Earl of Dxasr contended that the Govenmeut in creating this peerage had given a new interpretation to the Act of Union, which povides that no Irish Peer shall be created till three of those existing shall have become extinct. One Peer might hold three or more baronies, but the act did not intend that the extinction of those digaities, by the demise of one individual, w$sto be conaidered legal ground for a new creation. He thought it unfortunate the Government should, in two distinct cases, lhve raised a question between the House and the CRowN that had never before been mooted. He wished to know in what mode the point could be fairly argued before the Committee of Pri;vileges. Earl GRANvn.rE said the peerage had been created under the advice of the law officers of the CuoWvn. There was something unusual in the state of the elections of Irish Peers; however well qualified a Peer might be for a seat in that House, unless he had the support of the Earl of DEXRy he would not havo the slightest chance of obtaining it. The Earl of DERBY denied having any such influence; it was a matter that rested with the Irish Peers themselves. But the House was in this case bound to consider the validity of the patent on which Baron FEzrmoY claimed the right to vote in the election of an Irish Peer. Lord B.ouOamix and Lord CAqr.uBL concurred in the opinion that the Committee of Privileges had tho same jurisdiction in the case of Baron EaERmoy as in that of Lord WENSLEYDALR, though the former was brought before them only on petition. It was suggested that an advocate should be named to watch the case on behalf of the House; the subject then dropped. The Trial of Offences Bill went through committee. TheEarlof ErLxsOROUoGo, inpresenting a petition from certain merchant seamen, complaining of being obliged by law to go to sea in unseaworthy vessels, stated the manner in which the law bore hard on this class, and suggested that in every case of wreck an inquiry into the causes of it ought to be instituted. He thought a select committee should bo appointed to consider the subject. Lord STrANE of ALDERLEY read the legal opinion which had been obtained on the question by the Government, which he had no doubt would influence the decisions of magistrates in seaports, and pointed out the difficulties that would arise if seamen couId in all cases of leaving a ship plead that it was not seaworthy. The House then adjourned. In the House of Commons, Sir F. Kmzy, in moving for lcave to bring in a bill to consolidate the statute law relating to offences against the person, stated that this vas one of a series of bills for the consoEdation of the entire statute law of England, which he hoped, if he was encouraged and supported by the -House, would accomnplishi an object that had hitherto baffled many eminent law reformers. What lieproposed to do was, not to codify, but simply to consolidate the statute law as it now existed in the statute-book. This law was now comprised in 35 or 40 large folio volumes, containing about 20,000 acts, and he proposed,to subdivide and classify the whole of the subjects, anid to re-enactthe existing lawrelatingto each in one act, so that the statute-book, instead of 20,000 acts, would contain 200 or 300 only, each act emIbodying the whole statute law upon one particular subject. To show the necessity of a work of this kind he observed that the condition of the statute Law was such that judges and attorneys, as well as parties, in order to ascertain the written law npon any given subject, were obliged either to rely upon a text-book-, or to go through the whole 40 volumes, of 1,000 pages each, in order to find out what statute, or statutes, or portions of istatutes, bore upon the subject. This was but one of mnany evils. WVhen a bill was introduced into ParLiament, unless the iramer bad a perfect knowledge of the whole statute law with reference to the subjectmatter, he might increase the existing perplexity and confusion. Distin,,uishing between codification and consolidation of the entire written law (which he deemed not only practicable, but easy), 'the plan he proposed to adopt, he said, was to take one, two, or three of the most important, and at the same time most familiar subjects, and to embody in one law all the statutes, or parts of statutes, relating to each; then to taLe up other subjects, and thus by degrees to eliminate all the existing statutes, substituting one lawfor each particlar subject. He now proposed to deal, first, with the statute law relating to offences against the person; secondly, with the statute law relating to bills of exchange and promissory notes, the subjects of the two bills he wished now to introduce. Premising that his intention was to confine this process to England, he explained the manner in which he proposed to deal with statutes not of a publc and general nature, and with revenue acts and other classes of legislation, he proceeded to consider what should bc donewfithrespectto futureandcurrentle-.slation. Heassumedthatthere must be some officer or board authorized by both Houses of Parliament to watch over and superintend all bills for amending and improving the law, so as to make it consist and harmonize with the consolidated law, and he thought it would be easy to devise a modu,s eerandi by which the end might be effected. He pledged himself, if he was encouraged to introduce the other bils, most carefully to superintend and revise their preparation, and to employ in the operation none but the most competent men. He concluded with some reflections upon the difficulties which beset all attempts at a codification of the common law. The motion was seconded by Lord SsANLEY, who remarked that in law reform what had been wanting was a sufficient degree of popular interest out of doors. The difficulty had arisen not so much from actual obstacles as from a deficiency of impelling force. The calculation of Sir F. KEiLY, that his process of consolidation would reduce the statutebook to one-eighth of its present bulk, was not, in his opinion, exaggerated. Admitting thaevalidityof the objection drawn from the difficulties created by current legislation, it was no argument against the consolidation of past legislation and the clearing the statute-book of its present enctumbrances. The ATroRNEr-GENERA, obserred that all were perfectly agreed that it was desirable to consolidate our statute law, wrhich in its existing state was highly discreditable. The question, however, was what was the best remedy. He concurred with Sir F. XKELY that it was not desirable to combine codification with consolidation, and that the best thing was to begi wit the latter. Then came the question how was consolidation to be effected. The plan proposed zby Sir F. KR was the same as that which the Statute 1aw Commissioners were acting upon, and he could not understand whether Sir PirznoY was the organ of that Commission or was acting independently. He differed from the Commissioners, thinking that the consolidation should be upon a more comprehensive system. The fragmentary scheme would never be got through. There should be a complete outline of the law of England, mapped out and subdivided under different heads, and the whole should be simultaneously dealt with. He and the SoLTeIroEGxN;ERA3, however, had been in a minority in the Commission; but, so far from opposing the motion, he was ready to give every assistance to Sir znZRov in the good work he had undertaken. Ir. S. WORTLEY aeknoivledged that the plan suggested by the ATroRNEy-GxERAL would be infinitely preferable to that of Sir F. KELLYr; but the question was that was practicable, consistent with our institutions. His opinion was tllat there was more likelhood of passinog bills in which the law specific subjects was consolidated than a larger rv3asure. He agreed that the difficulties of codi6aition were insuperable. Sir F. KrnxY explained that he was no' the organ of the Statute Law Commission. Mr. J. PMf BBolo insisted upon t1e practicabiity and expediency of codifying the la W. Sir G. Guny said the Loun CQAwmmon had expressed his satisfaction at the tender of his assistance made by Sir F. Kmxz. Eis (Sir Gzonor.'s) opinion was that, if any practical advance was to be made in consolidating the statute law, it must be by degrees, proceeding subject by subject. After some remarks by Mlr. L. KmG, Mr. BArEs said he concurr- with Sir P. K1zy, considering that the present step was a good one, and that consolidation would present not obstacles to, but facilitiea for, codilication hereafter. The SoucrroR-Gn-Mu explained the plan of consolidation, founded upon a philosophical analysis of subjects, which had been propsed to the Statute Imaw ommisionerA, but rejected. He saw no more difficulty in codifying the law of England, wmitten or what was termed unwritten, than the law of ancient Rome. Ho agreed that it was a commencement of towork to consolidate our statute lawl. Sir F. KCi;Y made a short reply. Leaoewa given to bring in thisbill, as wellns a bll to conasdte the xtatute law relating to biUls of exchange ind promissory notes. Sir J.* tJREY, in moving for a return respecting the judges of the superior courts of law in Ireland, drew the attention of the House to the condition of certain of those judges, who, he said, were incapacitated .by age and infirmity. Mr. RESuNDY nioved the ornission of the words "' in Ireland." After a pause, compained lEan, with some warmth 3nd emotion, of the silence of the Government, and defended the judges namned by Sir J. SrTuEY againt what he considered to be an unjust and groundless attack and a blow aimed at the independence of judges. Sir G. GBny vindicated the right of the House to entertain questions of this kind, and justified the course pursued by the Government in the matter. He stated the substance of a correspondence which had taken placo between himself and the LORDIvrUTEANT of Ireland, who, while doing justice to the character and abilities of Baron PENrATnmuu admitted that, owing to his being permTanently afflicted with the infirmity of blindness, the contin.uance of that learned-judge upon the bench could not be defended by the Govermnent; adding that an intimation to that effect had been commsunicated by the LORD CHAcNELLoa to Baron PENNEiTArnR, who had returned no answer to the commlnication. Mr. DisuAnI considered the speech of Sir G. GnR unsatisfactory, and the conduct of the Government in the matter spiritless. He denied that the proposition of Sir J. SEXLLEY laid any grolund for the interferene of the House of Commons, which would not sanction imputations upon a judge wviose anegyric had been pronounced even by the LORDEavrENA,NwT of Ireland. The ATronNEY-GmszuL saw no objection to the maotion. With reference to Baron PEN.NwATHERthan whom, he said, there never had been an abler judge-although, intellectually speaking, as capable as ever of discharging his judicial functions, unfortunately ho laboured under an infirmity which mnust unfit him for his duties upon circuit, and especiallY in a court of crimilnal jurisdiction. Sir F. TISEsIGE. reminded the ATromy-GERHnA that Sir J. SHr=xy had pointed at Judges LERnoy and TonnEws as woell as Baron PxNNsFFATuna, and that no fact had been alleged to support the motion as regarded them. Mr. S. WORTLEY said ho could not vote for the motion without casting a reflection upon the judicial bench of Ireland. At the same time, he could notthink that a judge wascompetent to trycriminal eases who laboured under loss of sight. Mr. GEORGE spoke against the motion, which, he said, had originated with the Irish Government, in order to drive a judge from the bench. The motion was supported by Mr. H. BatrCE, and opposed by Sir R. FERGUSox and Mr. J. ParHi- Lord PAxERsTooN repelled the imputation that this motion was an artifice of the Government to drive a judge from the bench. If the question went to a division he should support the motion; but, on the whole, he thought it would be more consistent with respect towards these learned persons to withdraw it. Sir J. SHELLLy having replied, a division took place upon the amendment moved by Mr. KENNEDY, which was negatived by 134 to 120. The main question was then put, and upon a second division it was carried by 132 to 121. hIr. L. KuiG obtained leave to bring in a biU to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the summary jurisdiction of justices of the peace. On the motion of Mr. J. Prrnions the committee on the appointment of public prosecutors was re-appointed. Leave was given to introduce certain other bills. The Joint-Stock Banks (Scotland) Bill was read a third time and passed. The House adjourned at half-past 12 o'clock.
The Ministers whose high and honourable task it is to represent Great Britain in the approaching Conferences at Paris may well be excused if they enter upon their arduous and responsible task with deep anxiety and not without some misgivings as to the result. Clouds and darkness are over the face of the future into which they are about to fling themselves. The negotiations of the past year, and the different feelings and wishes of the allied Powers on many points, may reasonably check any feeling of over-confidence in whiclh the Ministers of this country might feel disposed to indulge. France and. Austria are closely united, and may be expected not to hold on all points language exactly identical with that which will be employed on behalf of Great Britain. It may be said, indeed, without at all straining language for the sake of effect, that in the matter of the present war France is the representative of the past, Austria of the present, and England of the future. The exertions of France during the last year have been so enormous, and their success upon the 'whole so splendid, that she may well assume to herself the weight justly due to a Power which has entered loyally and boldly into the conflict, and contributed most effectually to the final and glorious victory. Austria, on the other hand, though she has done nothing for war, is entitled to boast that she has accomplished much for peace; and, as her objects and those of France may be assumed to be nearly identical, they bring all that the past and present can give them to bear upon the other members of the Conference. There is no doubt that through the whole of these transactions the Emperor of the FrmNcH, though the frankness and loyalty of his conduct to this country present. the most gratifying contrast to the duplicity of his Bourbon and Orleanist predecessors, has shown a great desire to co-operate -with and conciliate Austria. le has borne with much patioace the timid and vacillating policy of a* Prince who entered into an alliance which he forbore to carry out by word or deed, and opy interfered at a moment when it appe:i that farther neutrality might be more gerous than an attempt to bring matters {a sudden and speedy conclusion. It is not us to canvass the policy of this alliance e merely note the fact as giving causeM r reasonable anxiety. There will be R anxious, no doubt, to retrieve by the of Bnuxow and the adroit flattery of Oan what she has lost by the sword, and t substitute for triumphs in the field succe.in the arena of diplomacy. The form of Jr governent assimilates more with that .iranc and Austria than with that of our t;, and she may reasonably expect to find e sympathy with any of the allies than from us, from whom she has naothing to look for beyond strict justice and an honourable adherence to the terms we have subscribed. These things may well weigh heavy on the hearts of the English Plenipotentiaries and increase the anxieties of their position. There are not wanting, on the other hand, grounds which should give these Ministers as ihuch weight and inspire them witlh as much confidence as any of those diplomatic personages with whom they are to be brought in contact. If the past and the present belong to France and Austria, the future, we may say without arrogance, is peculiarly our own. In weighing the proposals of the different negotiators Russia will be influenced not so much by what they have done as by what they may be able to do hereafter. France has done great things in war and Austria in peace ; but in this ungrateful world what has been done is apt to be depreciatedwhat remains to do is estimated at its full value, if not over-estimated. This is precisely the advantage of England. We have neither done all we intended nor all that we ought; but what we are yet able to do is, if rightly considered, really formidable. Of all the three great Powers we are the best able to continue the war.' Our finanees are in the best order, our credit the most extensive, our resources by far the least exhausted. By not keeping up large armaments in time of peace; by turning our attentioa to commerce andinteralinprovement, we perhaps did much to pirsu#dA Russia that we could be bearded with impunity and certainly paralyzed our exertions during the earlier period of hostilities. W are, indeed, but just beginning to put forth our strength. We have an army nothing like what it will be should the war be protracted a few years longer, but still in numbers and equipment very different from what it Was in February, 1854. We have a fleet nowv at lengtlh adapted to the shallow seas in which it is to operate, by far the most formidable engine oE destruction, if we consider its perfect discipline and organization, the great variety of vessels, and the union of irresistible force with rapid locomotivo power, that the world has ever seen. Nor let it be supposed that these are efforts only made for a single year, and which we cannot renew. Russia is still more bankrupt in men than in money, drained of the cultivators of her soil, and wanting in the materials of future armies. Austria could not bring her nominal forces into the field without a loan, which in the present state of her credit she would find it extremely difficult to contract; bust England can renew and increase armaments in any ratio that maybe required, without the prospect of decline or the slightest apprehension of exhaustion. Fed by her boundless commerce, supported by her indefatigable industry, and protected by the credit wLich she has always sacrificed everything to obtain, England is a Power really formidable, andone peculiarly calculated, if not to earn speedy triumphs, to terminate with success and glory long, bloody, and' exhausting wars. And she has, above all, this especial advantage,-that her wars are notthe wars of her Government, but of her people-the spontaneous act of a free nation which has counted the cost and will steadily adhere to its end until that end be accomplished. These things give to us, and they should give to those that are to represent us, confidence in oulselves and in the fature. There is no reason why their tone should not be as high, and their position as commanding, as that assumed by Lord CASTLEBEAGE forty years ago at the Peace of Paris. We are able to pay, and we are willing to fight; and what could a high-spirited diplomatist desire better than to be the monthpiece of such a nation ? Let our Plenipotentiaries bring us home good terms, and they shall be applauded; let them reject bad ones, and they shall be supported. Above all, let them fear nothing so long as they maintain with suitable diguity the honour and the position of the country. It may suit those who fear and envy us to say that our arms are tarnished and our prestige departed. We believe the calumny as little as they do. We are confident in ourselves, and have a right to require that the men who represent us shall fuUy participate in that confidence. We are lovers of peace, and would rather prolong the war now than break again into our ordinary avocations by renewing a struggle begun again because not fuilly fought out. We will forgive everything to the man who shall err in asserting too boldly and too loftily the rights and honour of England; but an Ambassador who should commit at Paris the errors of Vienna and humble the nation in the dust before foreign potentates would commit an offence which our sensibility could never forget and our self-respect could never forgive.
An English gentleman, having purchased a tract of land in Canada, conceived the idea of reserving some of it for a park. Accordingly, he visited his domain, marked all the trees that he wished to be preserved, left orders that all the rest should be cleared, and returned for a 'while to this country. On revisiting his intended park, he found, to his utter dismay, that the labourers employed upon it had carried out their own ideas of improvement by cutting down every tree that he had marked for preservation and leaving all the rubbish in its original vigour and deformity. There is much the same amount of difference between the Horse Guards and nearly all the rest of this country. It is the latter in this instance that takes the initiative, by marking the rubbish which the former perversely selects for distinction. When the highest representative of thn nation in this matter had sent'. out dcly qualified agents to find out the authors of a terrible disaster, and when thesc agents had done their duty, the result is that the very men ~hey have had the honesty to mark for censure are honoured, rewarded, and raised to offices of greater responsibility. The man who wrapped his talent in a napkin and buried it in the ground is rewarded for his discretion. Having been faithless over little, he has now muclh committed to him ;-for misgoverning one city he is made ruler over ten. This is not quite the most respectful use to make of a responsible Government, of a Royal commissioner, or a Parliamentary inquiry. There is, indeed, much to be said in its defence, for it is the rule of political corruption in all ages. Dat eniam, cervis might have been written over many a justice-seat and many a throne that came to no good in the end. It may be very delightful to see one's favour descending upon those who would be nothing without it; but there is an old belief that thrones are founded upon righteousness, and that the fountain of honour should flow in the channel of truth. We are aware that al we can say on this subject is set down to prejudice, or to some of the many ill-feelings which are supposed to give a journal a morbid weakness for the right. So we are not very sorry to fnd that on Thursday, the 28th inst., Er. L&YARD will give the House of Commons aR opportunity of remarking upon the men most criminated by an authentic report on the Crimean disasters, whom, therefore, the Court delighteth to honour. No doubt, consistency can be pleaded for the practice. If we begin with neglecting the promising cadet, by putting the dullard and the sluggard on the Staff, and leaving the genius a perpetual subaltern in the line, it is a suitable sequel of that beginning to give the highest honours and the places of greatest trust to men of proved incompetency. There is a vulgar opinion that a bad servant makes a bad master, and that if a man has no capacity for carrying out commands necessarily imperfect and ill expressed he wil also have no capacity for giving commands which wil meet with an obedience necessarily imperfect. In all systems of command there is a letter and there is a spirit. The commander and the commanded must do something moro than write the order and read it; they must enter into one another's souls, and meet one another half-way -nay, almost anticipate one another. WVhere this power is wanting there is niothing left to supply its place but a servile routine; and we may be quite sure that the man whlio obeys in the spirit of routine will give orders in it. Very possibly the officers who have just been promoted for doing nothing, and honoured for not being wholly destitute of personal courage, can by this time fni a good many faults in the system. That is the line of their defence. Being good for nothing else, according' to the Irish proverb, they ouglht to be capital hands at an excuse, and we have no doubt they are. They have plenty to say against the system which they carried out at all costs. But it is a great mistake to siippose that because a man has becomo lynx.eyed and open-mouthed about one stage of error that therefore he is prepared against a bighor. There is the greatest differenoo in the world between prospective and retrospective wisdom, and the greatest amount of the latter does not imply one grain of the former. QM tlh coatr -it a maa li bungled iu the lower stage, he most probably will in the higher; and the simple fact that he is engaged in pal. liating and smoothing over past errors is likely to pre-occupy his mnind against due preparation for the future. Very early in the war we ventured to depreCate a close adherence to routine, and were then met with the reply that routine might be good, or it might be bad, but that routine must be observed. This same routine, however, is now made the shelter of men who admit that, had they possessed the proper authority and moral courage, they might have done something for the preservation of our soldiers. But with their past experience they are now the men, we are told, to reform our routine, and to adapt it to actual war. But does it occur to these officers and their apologist to aak how it was that the war surprised us with a mass of routine unsuitable for war, especially for a war in those particular circumstances? The routine under which our army perished last winter was left us by the Duke of NVmramTo;-no inconsiderable organizer, administrator, and dispenser-a man who could construct, enforce order, and disregard them. Yet the systenahe so jealously guardedthe war administration at home, the constitution of our army, the relations of the Commissariat, and a great deal more, constituted the very system which broke down aS soon as we were at war with Russia. Only one conclusion can be drawn from this, and that is that the living system of one age is the dead routine of the next. IX everynevr war there will always be such peculiarity and novelty of circumstances as to baffle the calculations founded on former wars and to render routine a perpetual fetter. By way of suppostion, we have onlyto imagine the next war fought a dozen years hence in Central America, along the seaboard of the IUnited States or the Canadian fiontier, against no regular army, hut an armed population -against no feet, but an ocean swarming with privateers. What would then be the value of Crimean routineimprovea and administered by the hands into which it has been confided ? No doubt such a war as we suggest would demand the greatest freedom of operation, the most intuitive sagacity, the utmost tact and common sense,.-every quality, in fact,that our Generals have not shown in the Russian war; and if they did not show these qualities in the vigour of their age, neither will they if they survive to the next great war into which we may drift.
So far as the present feeling of Americans against England is based on any national conviction, the principle of it must be looked for in the general adhesion to what is called the XowNo doetrine, which is that the United States cannot safely suffer any further colonization of the Nevr World by European nations. Not only is it held that Powers heretofore strangers to the soil shall be prevented from gaining rights, but even a country like England, which already possesses what may be called an empire, shall be precluded fronm a further extension of territory. Although such a doctrine does not affect the rights of any foreign Power which has not assented to it, yet, partly fron the fact that the age of colonies is past, paDtly from the whole of tho two continents being under legitimate Governments. there has been a practical acquiescence in the principle enanciatel by the American statesman. To a citizen of the United States, then, it mnay seem a settled maxim of publiclaw; certainly there is none more frequently alluded to in patriotic orations, more constantly reiterated in official documents. " America for the " Americans!' is a phrase readily applauded in the States, while both speaker and hearers do not conceal how wide is the idea conveyed to them by the name " America," how purely national and exclusive is their use of the terrm " Americans." We believe that, so fax from being indignant, they will receive it with assent and complacency if wa ascribe to them a feeling that the New World should be peopled and added to civilization by the enterprise, under the auspices, and according to the examnple of the modelRepublic. It will be seen that both the causes of dispute refer to the same principle-that of not interfering with Europe, and, in turn, not permitting interference. To enlist American citizens for an European war, or to extend British territory on American ground, are acts which equally alarm the patriotism or pride of the Union. Such matters can be easily turned by a skilful polticLan into grave causes of dissension; the jealousy of even moderate citizens may be aaded to the restlessness or animosities of a less worthy class, and a general commotion excited among a people who have little knowledge of the merits of the questions at issue. A debate in the Anerican Senate had commenced at the departure of tho last steamer. The subject was the treaty respecting Nicaragua; the immediate question was whether the existing rights of England were curtailed or left as before by the effect of the treaty. Now, whether its operation is to be prospective or retrospective, whether its articles be ambiguously worded, what is the meaning of " protection" and " dominion," are questions which it would seem a temperata discussion could resolve. With respect ti the Bay of Islands, the British contend that they are ix possession, and are merely prohibited fromn an extension of territory; as regards the Mosquito kdngdom, they say that a protectorate exists and may rightly be maintained. The very words of the treaty which forbid either party to use " any protection which either affords or may " afford" for the purpose of erecting fortifications or founding a colony are urged to be sufficient proof that such a protectorate might legally esist. The Americans, on the other hand, would limit the British to Belize, acquired under the treaties of 1783 and 1786, asserting that their own prior treaties with Nicaragua are sufficient to justify them in resistng any further British ciaim, even irrespectively of the agreement of 1850. It is from questions so purely technical as these that the less moderate senators will probably wander into general denunciation of England and her policy. We are told beforehand from whom. wo have to expect warlike speeches, and native politicians hare often no difficulty in pointing out the motives which will inspire the various harangues. The address of MIr. SEwAD, however, is aleady before us, and, though his view of the treaty is wholly American, and his language is not wanting in force, yet we cannot complain of the tone in which he has discussed the question. He upholds the interpretation given by the American Cabinet, affirms that " under no "circumstances could the fiction of a Mosquito "Idng, kingdom, or protectorate be toleratedi" to interfere with American rights, and would' restrict England at Belize to what she - or!ginally acquired. From the enunciation of theso opinions he passes to the practical question of a settlement. Firmness, -without hostily to England, he looks upon as the proper policy of the United States. The States continually increase in power on their own continent; England, though tenacious, is slowly loosening her grasp. The trae policy is, then, the old one "5 of a mas" terly inactivity." However, as something must be done at once, he does not object to arbitration; but, as America has passed the limit at which 'he could with dignity propose it, he insinuates that England would act courteously in taling the initiative. The course, however, vhioh he pro. pose to his own country is hardly one which aL erlb sight seems to alloW any conciliatoy d=ne to be consistent with the self-reipoct of our IW T ix tbbt " a motib given to (k

EXPRESS FROlU PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.- Baron Brunow will not be left long on the field alone. Count Buol is probably by this time at Strasburg; hle was expected therethis morning, and he will be in Paris to-night or to-morrow early. aL de Cavour arrived this day at Lyons, and will have lost no time in pursuing his journey to this city. Aali Pasha, a telegraphic message informs us, left Constantinople on Tuesday, and will probably not arrive before the 22d. 3Mehemed Bey, who isMinister at Turin as well as Ambassador at Paris, "tvo gentlemen at once,' and who is now in the former city delivering his credentials, will go on to Alarseilles before returning, to receive the Plenipotentiary, and accompany him to Paris in due pomp. Count Orloff is expected on Sunday or Monday. He was to have left St. Petersburg on the 9th, and as the journey there to Berlin is five days, he will probably have reached the Prussian capital this evening. Five days' incessant travelling fatigues any man, much more one who is near 70, and we may reasonably suppose he will remain 24 hours if not more at that half-way house. He will of course see the Ringeand M. de Manteuffel, and may chanceito talk with them of the situation in general and of the Conferences in particular. The Conferences will probably not begin before the 22d or 23d -so at all events well-informed people suppose. Lord Clarendon is expected on the 17th or 18th. Lord Cowley, Ibelieve, only intended remaining absent from Paris four days. It is said that during his stay in London he will attend the Cabinet Councils, and will receive his Last instructions in company with Lord Clarendon The presence of a Russian Envoy once more in stalled in the well known Hotel of the Paubourg St. Honor6 has excited some curiosity, and a few groups stationed themselves there yesterday to see the show. They were disappointed, however, so far as Baron Brunow is concerned; the only exalted personage that showed himself in the street was Mfurphy, the Irish giant, 'who, it appears, is tall enough to light his pipe at the street'lamps. His appearance in the public thoroughfares coincident with the arrival of Baron Brunow is remarked by very acute people as significative. Whether the Hibernian Goliah has anything to do with the Conferences I know not. He has noViing very Machiavellian about him. Baron Brunow keeps himself a good deal on the reserve. He has been visited by several potitical personages, but, I believe, has seen very few, and to none has he been in the slightest degree communicative. You may suppose that people are anxious to learn his opinion on the result of the Conferences, but this opinion he keeps to himself. To hear him speak one would suppose that he was as innocent of diplomatic business, or of tho state of the present negotiations, as an infant of a week old. He avows his ignorance with such charming humility, and looks and speaks so innocently ! He is reported to have said yesterday to a personage who will probably have something to do with the conferences, that he really knew nothing whatever of the intentions of his Government beyond what the public at large knew; that his ministry is but a subordinate one; that Count Orloff is the only man who knows the derier mat of his Imperial mater, and that, in fact, he is as unacquainte.j with what is going on as ther merest stranger. The -PaZe publishes the foUowing teleraphio despatch : ftwS. ?deriurg Zoumne nsunoime that count Esterhazy was admitted on the 6th inst, to a private audience by the Emperor Alexander. It is the first audience given to the Austrian Minister since his return from Vienna." The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- " BERLIN, FEE. 13. "Thehealthof tho Empress Dowager of Russia causes some apprehension. 100 brss gUns from Kars have been placed at Tiflis in Alexander-square. General Williams is unwelL." "COPENHAGEN, Pro 12. "The eleotions for the Grand Council of the Kingdom have taken place in & conservative sense. AL Blubme, one of the accused Ministers, Count Holstein, x. Andral, Minis. ter of Finance, and MN. Broberg, Ankjar, and Fenger, are.unong those elected." A Council of Ministers was held yesterday at the Tuileries, at which the Emperor presided. A Paris letter of the 12th, in the Iiudipen4aie of Brussels, says:- "An affair which, without being of high political interest, is still of some importance from the difficulties which, during the last century, have attended its arrangement, has just been happily brought to a termination between France and Spain. I allude to the settlement of the frontiers of the two countries. The point so long in dispute is only some small portion of land in the Pyrenees, but, however small the value of it may be, this territory has been the object of constant disputes and collisionsbetweentho French and Spanish shepherdswho have sought. to establish themselves thereon. Several murders have been comxitted, and complaints have been constantly made on the subject to the two Governments. A Commission, in which France has been represented by General Caille and Baron Gros, has, after a long and minute examination, definitely drawn the line of frontier, so that no further dispute can now talce place. The inhabitants of each country wi from this time forward know with certainty wvhen they are or are not on their own territory, and there will be no longer any pretext for quarrels or acts of violence." Count de Lvwenhjelm, Minister of Sweden and Norway in Paris, has given in bis resignation, which has been accepted by King Oscar. He has occupiedthe post of resident Minister at Paris for 30 years, and during that long space of time, and in circumstances of no small difficulty, he has not only performed bis diplomatic functions to the great satisfaction of the various Govermments that have succeeded each other in this country, but has also gained numerous friends among nall classes of society. They who will regret him most are- the numerous indigent persons to whom his purse was always open. Count Lowenhjelm served in early life in the army, and, indeed, it is to him that the Swedish c.avalry owes its present organization. He bore a distinguished part in the war of 1808 and 18(9 against the Russians, and again in 1813 and 1814. King Charles John always regarded him in the light of a devoted friend, and set much value on his military and diplomatic talents. He employed him more than once in important missions, even during the time he was his representative in Paris. Count L-owenhjeln is the last survivor of the statesmen of Sweden who occupied a distinguished part during the reign of Chaxles X1V. He had received from the late Sovereign all the honours and distinctions to which a Swede can aspire, and the reigning cPrince, wishing to add to the recompenses already obtained, and to mark in an especial manner services so valuable, has, I understand, accorded him a pension of an exceptional kind. The retiring Minister wi be succeeded by Baron de Manderstrom, who is pronounced by his countrymen as one of the most eminent men of his native country. He has for many years past occupied the post of Di)rector of theDepartment of Foreign Affairs, and is said to enjoy the unlimited confidence of King Oscar, who appointed him, about a year ago, his Mtinister atVienna, which was but the stepping-stone to his advancement to the post much more important under present circumstances of Anbassadorto Paris. Baron de Manderstr5m, enjoys in addiiion to his diplomatic honours the great and rare distinction of being one of the 18 members of the Academy of Sweden. The Assemble Nafio)w7e has not yet encircled its pages with a black border, in sign of mourning for the triumph of the allies in the Crimea. Evidently it is not the will that is wanting, and if the Fusionist organ had the power it would make itself as black as the apron of the blacksmith Goa, who, for having successfully resisted the tyrant Zohak, saw that homely appendage become the Eoyal standard of Persia. Perhaps some such honour is some day reserved for it. In the meantime it vents its spite as much as it can consistently with safety. The AssemU1e alone, of the Paris journals, publishes a leading article, in which, as is customary with it, abuse of Great Britain forms the first and lst element. The grave political fault now committed by England, according to that journal, is the desire of giving a representative government to the Moldo-WallachianProvinces. I cannot conceive the objections that can be offered to such a project, which wiU bear fruit in the East if carred out conscientiously, and if not restricted by the jealous influence of the neighbouring Powers. I also fail to reconcile the admiration of liberal institutions professed by the Assernblde Nationle with this desire to destroy the hopes of a promising race and to arrest the progress of civilization and liberty in the East. I quote the following passages from the article in question "If the negotiations- opened at Constantinople on tho onestion of the Constitution to be given to theDanubian Principalities have not had any result, the causeis chiefly to be attributed to the pretensions of England to endow these provinces with a representative Government. This would appear to us beyond belief if we had not seen often, and much nearer to us, these efforts of the English Government to establish in countries the least prepared for them those institutions which have become a permanent cause of disorder, divisions, and weakness, all tending to the profit of British influence. A despot who desired the destraction in the eyes of the 'worla of the consideration enjoyed by representativeeinstitutions, orDwho'wished to rendertbem an object of fear to nations jealous of their repose and independence, could not effect more injury .... Whatsurprises us is that England should be still animated with this seal for a repre. sentative propaganda, which afew years ago served as a pretext for the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. We had believed this ardour to have been singularly diminished by seeing the Pirst Minister of England reserve his most violent enthusiasm for governments which assuredly do nut approach his ideaL . . The question is, it is said, to be examined in Paris after the general signing of the treaty of peace. We believe it to be already solved. But even were the preten. sions to introduce representative institutions in the MoldoWallachian provinces to be supported by Lord Palmerston in person, they would encounter slender sympathy in the new Congress; and although we are ardent and sincere partisans of free governments, we congratulate ouselves on that issue." I mentioned at the time a scene of violence which occurred on the 21st ult., near the gate of the church of the Madeleine, -where a numerous crdwd was assembled to render the last honours to the celebrated Polish poet Adam Mlickiewickz. Two members of the Polish Emigration, residing in Paris, Count Zamoyski and M. Jazwinski, having met there, the latter accused the Count of having deserted the Polish cause, and struck him with his cane. Proceeding3were taken aganst x. JazwinBki and he was tried yesterday for the assault, by the 6th Court of Correctional Polce. In reply toAke, questions addressed to him by the President,, M. Jazwinski stated that he was 56 years of age, that he resided in Paris since 1832, and that be held the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the formtr Polish army. Count Zamoysld, who appeared *a a wit. ness, declared that he claimed no damages from the defendat. Afterhearing the explan ations given by the latter to justify his conduct, thea Court sentenced bim to four months' imprisonmetat. A number of Polish refugers gave a dinner the day before yesterday to Geaeral Zamoyski, who is about to proceed to CoeBtantinople. It was attenaed by Prinoe L. Cpartoryski and by other Poles of diatiution, and Pxriliv Adam Cttoz rski min tiw evening joined the party. Toasts to the allied Powers, to the two Princes Czartoryski, and. to General Zamoyski were drank with enthusiasm. | The Council-General of the Bank of France decided to-day that commercial bills having 90 days to run should in future be accepted and discounted. A ball will be given by the American residents in Paris on the 22d inst., the anniversary of the birth of Washington. All the distinuo'ished persons in Paris of various colintries, including, of course, the members of the diplomatic corps, will be invited. The ball is expected to takc place in the spacious saloons of the Hotel de Louvre.

Shot, shell, and other mstwiel de guerre continue to arrive from theCrhaea. These, with supplies received from the interior by railway, form an arsenal such as it is declared M1arseilles never before pos. sessed. The French steamer Jacquard arrived here on Sunday. She sailed from Constantinople on the 29th of January. She brought 100 Russian cannon, 1,800 bomb-shells, and 260 soldiers. Typhus fever declared itself among the troops during the passage and two of them died in the harbour. The sanitary board held. a consultation, and it was decided that the Jacquard shoild proceed to the Frioul, and land the sick at the Lazaretto there. She returned to the port of the Joliette in the afternoon, and received pratique. The British sailing trans. port Lady Suffolk, of 1,300 tons, chartered by the French Government, arrived on Monday. She sailed from Constantinople on the 16th of January, and was laden with shot, shell, and cannon unfit for further service. The French mail steam packet Borysthano sailed onMonday forConstantinople. She took a few passengers, among whom were General Espinasse, commanding a division of the army in the Crimea, andMartimprey, Chief of the Staff of MIarshal Pelissier. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Vectis arrived on Mfonday, carrying the Indian mail. She made a remarkably quick passage from Alexandria of five days and a half. The screw steamer Alhambra, Captain Norie, of the same company, sailed this mornming with the outward-bound Indian mail for MIalta. She has afull complement of passengers, among whom are several British officers. The Alhambra has given great satisfaction to the passengers who have lately travelled by her from her very smooth motion. The Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles has received a communication from the harbour-master at Barcelona, announcing that during the late teapestuous weather a bank of sand has been formed at the point of the new pier 99 Spanish feet long, 85 wide, and 13 deep. Private letters received from Algiers, of the l0th inst., announce that there has been some severe fighting between the Imperial troops and the Kabyles. The insurgents were defeated on every point, but the insurrection is not yet suppressed. The official accounts state that the tribes of the Beni-Ouaguenon, the Flissat-el-Bahar, and the 3BeniAyssi, having joined the Kabyles who refused to submit to French dominion, the Zmouts, to whom the Governor-General of Algeria had entrusted the safekeeping of the Valey of the Sebaou, likewise forfeited their allegiance, and altogether they advanced to Tizi-Ouzou, in hopes of cutting off the French post lately established there. The Governor-General having been apprised of the sudden insurrection, despatched, on the 22d nlt., General de Ligrly with three battalions of the 60th Infantry, a squadron of the 7th Hussars, and a section of Artillery. The General, with an advanced gurd of 25 Hussars and four companies of the 60th, arrived at Tizi-Ouzou on the24th. The approach of the French troops was sutfficient to make the Kabyles retreat. They formed, however, on the side of their mountains, and continned firing shots, as if in defiance. The General having on the 28th routed the Beni-Ayssi, the tribes of the Temda and the Mekla, with the loss of 20 killed, resolved to penetrate into the recesses of the OuledAissa-Mintoun and finish with the insurrection. He crossed the Sebaou on the 30th, and attacked the Kabyles at daylight the following morning. They resisted with remarkable obstinacy, but Colonel Pelet at the head of the 60th Regiment drove the insurgents from all their positions. The artillery contributed powerfully to the success of the Imperial troops. The French lost in killed four men, and. among them Sergeant-Major Berthet, who died gloriously at his gun. The Kabyles lost 50 kiled, a aultitude of wounded, together with a herd of oxen and flocks of sheep. The judicious movement of General de Ligny produced the submission of tha Beni-Ouaguenon, who accepted all the conditions imposed on them. The Beni-Ayssi soon followed their example. The insurrection is at present confined to the mountains of the Beni-Raten, where it broke out, and where it continues to be as violent as ever. AUSTRIA. (aR&Xs oli owN coRESroNnDENr'.) VMENNA, Fan 1L MIany years have elapsed since the saloons of the palace inhabited by the Mnister for Foreign Affairs were so densely crowded as they were last night. Every one wished to bid the successful diplomatist. " God speed" before he left for the French capitals and consequently not a member of the diplomatic corps and of the-aristocratic world neglected to attend his farewell soiree. Cout. Buol, who seem;ed greatly flattered by tho ovatiol he received, was in excellent spirits, and replied to- the congratulations of his friends by remarkbing that he sincerely hoped he might see as many smiling faces around him on his return from Paris as le then beheld. The. epithet of "successfur' has above been employed because Count Buol has not only displuyed far greater diplomatic.1 skdll than any of hia eompetitors, but because he hlj surmounted difficUiea which to most men w'juld have appeared iUmountable. The policy 'of the Austrian Mini3ter has from the verY out't been vigorously opposed by the whole of the eivi and military aristocracy of the country, a'.ad Prussia, with the seoond-rate Gerrnan Stat'A ha sys-I tematically endeavoured to thwart, his plans fot oxtending- the European coalition against Rusia. It is notorious that all kinds- of proects have been frmnad for depriving Count Bu4l of fthe gonfideio of his &Yoroim g>d. it is equally well known that tho machmations of his enemiies were on two several oecasions very nearly attended with success. At onc time the .Russian party had even discovered a successor for him in the person of Count Fredetic Thun-the present civil Adlatus of airshhal Radetzsky-a man who enjoys a hig, reputation for his Russian sympathies and theamediocrity of histalents.. oDmmonjusticerequiredthat the-fore'going tribute sould be paidto the merits of the Aus- trian MinisterforForeign Afiairs, butit is necessp, l to add that his tri-mph has been at the expense of England and France. The assertion is a bold one, but feW persons whln have attentively read the conditions which are to serve as the bases of the future peace will be inclined to doubt its correctness Austria, who has not struck a single blow, has gained everything that she originally demanded from Russia, and has, besides, deprived her of a part of her territory, while England, after expending so much blood and treasure, has not even succeeded in securing the neutrality of the eastern coast of the Black Sea. Hints havel'been given me that it is useless to harp on this string " as the matter is definitively settled;" but you will permit me once again to observe, that in my opinion the peace wiMl be a most unsatisfactory one, if Russia should be permitted to reconstruct her forts on the Circassian coast. It is urged that the inhabitants of the Caucasus have shown themselves unworthy of the sympathy felt for them by the nations of the West, and there is some show of truih in the assertion; but it must not be for&otten that the independent mountaineers have always displayed as strongly pronounced a disliketo their ancient enemies, the Turks, as to their more recent oppressors, the Russias. If, instead of a Turkish army under Omar Pasha, au Anglo-French corps had been sent to Mingrelia, the:inhabitants of the adjoining provinces -woula hardly have displayed such readiness to take up armns in defence of the Russians. That the maore influential men are in the pay of the Czar is a notorious fact, but it is morally [certain that the people would be but too happy to shake off the foreign yoke. According to theParis correspondent of the Oesterreiki.sche Zeitung, the three Powers have already agreed on the most important points, and one of them is, that Nicolaieff, " not being on the coast of the Black Sea," is not to share the fate of Sebastopol. The passports for Count Orloff and Baron 'Brunow are already waiting for them at Frankfort-on-the-Maine. According to our calculation, M. de Bourqueney must have reached Paris yesterday. Mr. Julian Pane, who goes to Paris -with the Earl of Clarendon, is likely to render good service, as he must be perfectly well acquainted with every move that was made during the Vienna Conferences. The Amico Catolice, which is printed in the office of the Archbishop of Milan, is very violent in its attacks on the press, but the pastoral letter of the lishop of Bergamo is still more fierce. The right reverend gentleman declares that the abolition of the " preventive censure " is the work of the devil's own hands.- " Our forefathers," says the leader of the fock of Ber gamo, " knew that such a ' censure ' furthered the welfare of society and prevented a great deal of evil, but now the so-called 'freedom of the press' has been introduced into -rany States, and people are allowed to think and print what they think fit. The wicked are enthusiastic in their praises of the freedom of the press, but the good consider it a public calamity; they think that with the abolition of the political 'book censure' thelawsof God and of the Church have been abolished. llany newspapers endeavour to diminish the importance of the Concordat, and, under the pretext of appeasing public excitement and recommending moderation to the bishops, they seek to excite the passions of the people, to intiuidate the Church, and to disseminate distrust and discord." M. de Bunsen's work, Signis of tie Times, has been replied to by a- ex-diplomatist*, but few of his astions have I-een satisfactorily refuted. The "copncession' of the Western Railroad-the line betw(iui Vienna and Salzburg-was the day before yesiterday officially made to Messs Merk and Indheihm, The Exchange was in a remarkably good humour to-day. London fell to 1OIL 21k, gold to 11 per cent. and silver to 8 per cent. premium. Shares in the Credit Batik were in great demand, and rose three percent.

"MIy despatch of the 26th of January was already in your Excellency's hands when on the 236 of January Count Esterhazy communicated to me the Austrian despatch, of which a copy is an nexed, of the 25th January "The annex to that despatch, the declaration which Austria has the intention to make to the Diet, has naturally been the subject of our serious consideration. If theVisenna Cabinet, before deciding upon it, had consulted us on the subject, we might have been able to point out a desirable modification, and we could not at first sight have decided in the negptive the questionas to whetherit would not be better to adjourn for a time the communication to the Diet. "That consideration, however, did not prevent us from standing by the derision of the Imperial Cabinet as soon as it was taken, actuated by that sincere desire of which we have given so many proofs, of seeing tbe Diet come to a resolution upon it, rendering testimony to the union of Germany and of the two great Powers, in so far as such resolution is recondcleable with the dignity andwith the al interests of the German Confederation. "We are convinced that. oar German Allies recognize like ourselves, and with sincorc satisfaction. that the preliminaries accepted by the belligerent Powers form an acquired basis for a speedy peace. I already stated in my despatch of the 26th of JTanuary, thatPrussia, in her quality of a European Power, is xeady to adopt that basis, in procuring which she is. convinced she contributed on her part in the inte2este,of the peace of Europe, when the moment came for decision to intervene; to adopt it, Isay, in a manne-notto admik,of any further adjournmentor compromisol. by signing; the prelimiaries anEd by participating in the-neoptiatioes connected therewith, if in. vited thereto by the I-owers interested.

Selin Pasha is playing a peculiar game here, sending away all Europeans in the Turkish service who might act as a check upon his conduct. He has just ordered Hussein Bey-a Hungaian, high up in the medical department-offto Constantinople, on the plea that it would be irregular to keep him at Ereroum, as he belonged to the garrison at Kars. The true reason is, that Husseinhas aleanin, towards the English. He has beer stowing awa3r other Europeans in a siEhlilr way in all sorts of out-of-the-way corners, but the chief difficulty opposed to his making Erzeroum a little terrestriaL Paradise, a la, Pasfia lurqe, is the presence of Eglgsh officers. The position of the latter has, however, been an awkward one since the departure of General VYilliams from Armenia; but Lord Stratford has ordered Colonel Geales, of the Iadras Artillery, to join them, arnied with acting powerm both from the English and Turklsh Governmaents. This mode of meeting the difficulty is the very best that could be devised. Winter has set in, andthere is very little to be done just now. Every one hopes to see General WVilliams back at his old post by next spring. I must repeat the opinion 1 expressed once before. Tf Selin Pasha be left to his own devices Erzeroum cannot but fall in case of an attack. The fellow is too thick-headed even for a puppet. He ought to be changed for a man of more ability, if possible ; if not, at least for one more tractable. Setting everything else aside he has already earned dismissal as richly as any Pasha in the Ottoman Empire, and that is saying much. General ymeti's opinion on military matters ought to go for something. I have his support in saying that if Selim. Pasha had made a demonstration towards Kars, and dashed some horses in for the artillery, the garrison might have fought their -way out, and the guns been saved. As it was, he sent on falsehood. upon falsehood, promising an advance-and the consequence was the loss of everything but hosiour. The main body of the Russians have retired from Kars, takdng all the guns with them. The road to Gumri is represented as being quite open, despite the snow. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES.

THE ARTRY IN THIE CRIMEA (nIROX ouR OWN CORIxSPONDlNm l CAMP BEBOltE SEBASPTOPol, 1. Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the night of the 29th ul, the whole camp was startled by the heaviest canmonade that has been heard siuce the f lof Sebastopol. Although the night was pitch dark-, officers flocked up to Cathcart's-hill, and from a considerabIe distance down the road curious spec*tors hurried to the front. The cause of the firing appears to have been as follows :-Six boats, full of men, put off from the Rusian side of the harbour with the intention, as some suppose, of effecting a landing in Sebastopol, although it is difficult to conjecture what advantage the enenty could have expected to reap from so hazardous an enterprise. Others talkl of a reconnaissance, but the Russians can distinguish more with their glasses in the daytimc than they could from their boats in so dark a night. Finally, a third conjecture points to the sunken men-of-war, concerning which there is a myth current to the effect that they are hold dowvn below water by cables, audwiU start up afloat as soon asthose are severed. Itis not very probable that the Russians propose to raise their submnerged fleet just now, so that thia hypothesis falls to the ground, umIess its ingenious framers imagine that they were going to see after the tackling, or to ascertain the ravages of the worm. Rather unlikely; and, in truth, nobody knows the object of this sortio of boats. Fire was opened upon them; tho French are said to have sunk one of them, and then they retired, and the Russians commenced a furious cannonade from all their batteries right round tc Ikermnann. Itis reported that they sent shells into the Malaklhoff, and even into the IRedan. As usual, the damage done waa very small. A shell fell into the French guardboat, ca-ried off a Dan's arm, and went through the boat's bottom; but the crew stuffed a coat into the hole and got safely to shore. A round shot went through the roof of the Town-Major's house in the English part of Sebastopol, but hurt no one. The fire was chiefly directed against the French, who replied vigorously. Vory heavy while it lasted, it was not long sustained. There is no variation to note in the health of the army, which continues excellent. What a contrast between last year and, this I List week's return gives 18 deaths (of which 5 are in the Land Transport Corps) in an army of 53,000 men, our present strength in the Crimea, exclusive of the Highlanders, &c., at Kertch. In the correspondincg week last year the army here was about 29,600 strong, arcd there were538 deaths! 18 deaths in53,000 isabout 1 in 3,000, or 1-30 per cent. per week, or at the rate of 1 22-30 per cent. per annum,-about IT per mil, which would be a low average of mortality in an English population of the same age, all males of, say, between 18 and 45 years old. After this who shall venture to talk of the noxious climate of the Crimea? Winter is, of course, nozious in any country, if men are exposed to it without proper food, clothing, and shelter. But if the clinate here be so hurtful and fatal, how is it that the English on the plateau of Balalava, and the Turikish Contingent at Kertch, enjoy such excellent health and such an exemption from mortality as is hardly to be paralleled in the annals of armies? I stood by the roadside, two mornings ago, watching a fatigue party, 1,000 strong, march down to the stores for wood. I never saw such pictures of rude health as all the men were. The young recruita, of whom there are quito as many as is desirable, have got acclimatized, and are gaining a more manly and hardy look. I particularlynoticed the clean, smart appearance of the ;soldiers of the 57tLh Regiment, of which a strong detachment was included in the fatigue party. This regiment is one of the finest out here,--certainly one of the crack corps of the Fourth Division. It is very essential to make the physical condition of the men a main point of army discipline, and one which it is an important and particular duty of officers to attend to ;and 1 believe that there isan incrensed consciousness of this out here, aud that many officers are most zealous in considering and promoting, by every means in their power, whatever m-ay contribute to the health of their soldiers As regards moral improvement and wholesome pastime, the efforts made by various officers, colonels of regiments, chaplains, and others, to supply the men with books and readingaccom.modation, have, nodonbt, borne good fruit in their degree. Owing to the necessity of erecting dwellings for the army, it has been found impossible to get up as many reading huts as were at first projected, but something has been donte, and some of the divisions are well provided with books. The wear and tear of these is, of course, considerable, and we have not nearly enough yet. The Guards, I understand, are pretty well stocked with literature, and there is a reading hut in their camp, well attended, and where perfect order is preserved. The Fourth Division has a library for the use of the men. The Scotclh Brigade up beyond Kamara is the worst off for books, and this is a great pity, for nearly all the men read, and none in the army would be more glad of a supply of food for the mind. Books are on the way from England, but they are tardy in arriving. What has become of the Harbinger steamer? We are uneasy about her, for she is three weeks overdue. She has on board a largenumber of parcels for officers and six boxes of books sent by Mr. Albert Smith for the use of the army. There really seems to be very little balance in the minds and measures of certain departments at home. They are always in one extreme or the other. In recent letters I alluded to the glut of useless articles and of others which will not be wanted for many months to come. The profusion of the providers of the army is not, however, limited entirely to inert matter,-to woollen socks, soluble cocoa, fur boots, And the like. About the end of last summer we 'Were almost without chaplains here. The few that 2eamined were sickening from over-work. Some of them hadas many as 500 sickto attend to and comfort, besides the care of a brigade. It was more than human strength could do, to do it properly. Representations were made, and the deficiency was repaired. By the month of October the spiritual necsities. of the army were abundantly provided for; the aUpply was well kept up, and now that we have fer men in hospital there is very little for the chaplains to do. Nevertheless, we now learn flat nine more clergymen of the Church of England have been sent out. We can only suppose that it is in'ended to confer a bishopric on the Rev. Mr. I l9gan, and to give livings in England to some of the senior chaplains, and that the ntw comers are to replace them. Otherwie it is hard to say what they will find to do. This is not alL. The dericalesablishment of the army in the East baa hitherto comprised there professions-namely, clergymen of the Church of England, Presbyterian inisters, and Roman Catholiepriests. These might bethought to suffice, but it has just been discovered at home that they do not, and Wesley is to be rePretedhere, in a sort of non-official way. Weslea n minister No. 1 is shortly expeted. "cstnext " ats *lr. Cobden says. If the army 0tOpere long enough, we may hope to be favoured *ith the presence of lninisters of every one of the i erouseci, which armao andal in the eyes of Of course, some nice liHttle religious fud,bickeiDgs,audheartbumings maybe eected to enaue. Already slight dificultie have occured, owing to the refual of & Catholic priest to recog-. ize in natters total1y unconnected with the service or discipline of his Teligion tbe authorit of a Protestant superior. But, on being given hischoice between submission and resignation, he preferred the fonner. The rage for proselytism has found its way even to the Crimea. An Englishman, hero apparently as sin amatetur, but who is said to be the authorized agent of a religious society at home, has been distributing Italian bibles among the Sardinian troops, and attempting to convert them. GeneralDellaAlarmora complained to General Codrington, who was rather puzzled what to do in the matter, and, as I am informed, told the Sardizian Commander to deal with the person in ques tion, should he be caught repeating the offence, according to the Sardinian law and regulation. The missionary in question, notwithstanding that his labours are facilitated by a perfect acquaintance with the Italian language, has not been very fortunate in their results. I am assured that he has not effected a single conversion. The Sardinians take the books, jult as the Spanish smugglers, and muleteers, and gipsies took the tracts which a more celebrated missionary, Bible Borrow, pressed upon their acceptance; but it is much to be doubted whet'ner they read them, and it is quite clear that they do not profit by them to the extent of embracing Protestantisrn. The good understanding between the Sardinians and the English is too perfect to be affected by trifles; but intermeddlings of the kind referred to are strongly to be condemned. The weather, which continued mild up to yesterday, has undergone another change. Snow began last evening and continued during the nig,ht and this morning, but it was not heavy, and, except -where it drifted, the surface is but thinly coated. The eaves of the huts are fringed with long icicles, but the cold is not great, and the thermometer remains :just a shade above freezing point. The camp is dull and wet, andthere are few persons out of doors, save those whom duty or business summon forth, the in side of a hut being generaJly considered preferable in this weather to the outside of a horse. One of the greatest annoyances met with here is the contiuued los of horse-shoes. In muddy weather they stick in the mud; in dry weather they fly off -with a clank against the irregular stonework of the roads. It is nothing unusual for a person who takes daily rides to lose four or five shoes in the course of the week. The inconvenience is excessive, the loss occurring often far from a forge, or perhaps halfway from a man's own quarters to his destination, and he has the option of walking his horse all the way through cold or rain, or of knocking his hoof to pieces. Jt is customary to attribute this frequent loss of iron to the suction of the heavy clay, which is certainly considerable, but I incline to think the shoeing has also something to do with it. The shoes are very good, but the nails are not so. I got a handfUl of them the other day, and found them of all lengths and sizes, some of them with flaws in them, and ha-ring much the appearance of refuse nails-a very mixed lot indeed. This is not the case at all the forges, but it is at some, and there is a great difference in the duration of shoes put on in diferent camps. Notwithstanding the prospect of peace, horseflesh, at first depreciated by the announcement, is in pretty good demand, and there was some brisk biddinlg at La3t Donnybrook horse fair. In the irst plac, many people are disposed to be incredulous about peace, and then they say that even if it be made it will be months before the army can get home, and meanwhile they must have horses, which here are no luxury, but a necessary of life. Indeed, for most part of the time at this season it is a very small luxury to go plunging through deep mud, your unfortunate nag, always up to his fetlocks, occasionally sinking tohisknees in some treacherous hole, or to clatter along, the Doyne highway, crowded with carts, hut-carriers, mules, and every sort of locomotive impediment. The Crimea is certainly not seen to advantage at this time of year, although such a day as last Sunday, wvith its pure blue sky, its warnm sun, its ck'arly-defined and cloudless horizon, gives one enougE: good humour to support one through a week of sain, mud, and milow, in hopes of such another day, and more of them. It is in autumn that th Crinea should be visited, when the heat is modbrate, and the first mellow tints are on the leaf, and there .is good riding ground, so that you have only to go straight to any point you wish, without malding great circuits to tuan the flank of a morass, or keeping on the ridges because you know that in the valley youwill be bogged. It is rather earlyv on the Ist day of February,to look forward to spriig, but the -vinter has been so open that we hope it may come early, and already we have indications of its approach in the shape of tufts of delieate primroses and great abundance of snowdrops inthe valeys near BaIaklava and Kamar-; and here and there, even in onr much-troddencamp, one sees the fresh green tip of the crocus just showing itself abovetheground, as if doubtful whether to come forth, and fearing, from last year's experience, the tramp of mma or horse.

TURKEY. (FROM olm Owl UORRESPONDENT.) CONISTANTINOPL-, Fn. 4. . I It is well inown how jealously Oriental etiquette guards every step of the Sovereign, and how anxiously it removes him from all familiar contact with the rest of mortats. As long as the Sultanu of Turkey had to conquer an empire at the head of their armies they kept up their simple patriarchal relations as chiefs of their tribe, but when onea they were firmnly seated on their throne at Stamboul they began by degrees to revive and to imitate the traditions of the Byzantine empire, and surrounded themselves with all the forms which refined Oriental despotism has invented to exalt the person of the monarch. These forms have beenminutely adhered to up to the present time, in spite of the changa3 which are gradualy creeping into all other old institutions of the Turkish empire. The present war, however, seemns destined to break down even this barrier, and the first breach in it has been already made. On Thursday last, the 31st of January, the rumour spread al at once that the Sultan would attend the bl costunme at the English Embassy. It seemed scarcely credible that the successor of the Caliphs, the spiritual and temporal head of the MIahomedan religion, would go to see polkas and waltzes performed-yet so it was. Early in the afternoon the narrow main street of Pera bore an unusually excited aspect; numbers of people had taken up their positions in the neighbourhood of the Embassy to witness the Sulaii's passage. The Turkish dignitaries, who- were all to be present at his arrival, were encumbering tho streets with their horses and carriages. An English guard of honour, composed of detachmentsof GuardsandHighlanders, with the band of the 1st Regiment of the German Legion at their head, marched up to the sound of 'military music, and lined the approaches of the palace. At 8 o'clock a fire lighted on the heights above the Imperial Palace of Tcheragan, followed by a salvo of artilery from Galata Serai, was the signal that the Sultan had left his palace. A little before 9 he arrived at the gate of the Embassy, escorted by a detachment of the 12th Larncers, and a guard of honour composed of British officers of all arms. At his approach the troops who lined the outer courtyard presented arms, and the band struck up the " Sultan's march," and " God save the Queen." The court itself was illuminated by nunmerous lamps and adorned with transparencies, which, however, I owing to the blasts of wind, were only partiaUy suc- cessful. At the great staircase, which was crowded with officers of the allied armies and Turkish dignitaries, the Sultan was received by the Ambassador and his whole personnel. Accompanied by them he passed amid the crowd of guests who were already assembled into the balroom. There an armchair on a raised dais, covered with carpets, was prepared for him, to which he was conducted. Having sat down,with the representatives of the foreign Powers on one side and the Turkish dignitaries in attendance, on the other, ho had several of the ladies presented to him. Then the dancing began, which seemedto excitehis interestconsiderably, audhestooI up in order to have a better view of the proceedings. After looking on for about an hour, he expressed his desire tobe shown into the refreshment-room, where he partook of some slight refreshment. He intended to return once more to the balroom, but he found the heat too intense, so, after remaining in the refreshment-room for some time, His Imperial Mlajesty took his departure. Taking the ambassador by the hand, -he descended the staircase accompanied inthe same manner as on his arrival, and soon the guns of Galata Serai announced that he was on his way back. He did not return to his palace, bu t passed the night in a kiosk belonging to his brother- - in-law, Ahmed Fethi Pasha. One must remember the religious prejudices of Mahomedans against all trivial amusements, and the strict rules of etiquette which were always kept up in all relations of the Sultan with the representatives of foreign Powers, in order to appreciate this act of the Sultan to its full extent. What in other countries would be a polite but insignificant ceremony receives here a certain political importance. It is the first time that a Sultan of the Ottoman empire has honoured the house of the representative of a foreign Power with his presence. As successor of the Prophet and. Shahin Shah, or Ring of Kings, the Sultan in the eyes of his Mahomedarn sb. jects cannot deal on a footing of equality with any other Sovereign. In spite of the lessons of modem history, and the doubts of the more enlightened among the Mahomedans, this idea is still the prevalent one among the masses, who remember only the time when the Sultan was the undisputed Lord of the Mahomedan East, and the representatives of foreign Powers were only tolerated at Constantinople. The fact of the Sultan's visiting the house of a foreign Ambassador is more calculated to open their eyes to the real state of the case as it is at present than any other, and it required a certain amount of moral courage in the Sultan to make this first step to break down these false but cherished ideas by his own free wilL The way in which this was done shows, however, that he entered fully into the spirit of this new position. His taking refreshments, how. ever trivial it may seem to Europeans, is full of meaning in this respect. Every act of the Sultan's private life is so jealously concealed from every eye that nobody except his chief eunuch isallowed to attend at his meals. This rule, originally intended as a safeguard against poisoning, forms in the eyes of hispeople atime-honouredusage religiously observed. Every contact with his person is likewise strictly forbidden by usage to all strangers, - the only exception being made at the Bairam, when the highest dignitaries, and only these, are allowed to kiss his feet; and at the ball on Thursday he took the Ambassador by the hand and walked down with him the whole length of the staircase tohis carriage, in the presence of a crowd of attendants and foreigners. But this act gains the greatest importance from the time at which it happens. It is a kind of sanction to the concessions which are to be made to the non-Mahomedan subjects of the Porte. With the abolition of the privileges of the MIahomedan ruling race, their head, the Sultan descends, by his own free wil, from the exceptional position wlichhe has hitherto observed with regard to the represenitative3 of Christian Powers. Old Turkey is dead ard done; the ball on Thursday last was the burial ceremony, and the lively strain of polkas andwaltzes its funeral march. I wrote to you in my last that the propositions of the Ambassadors for the amelioration of the con*idition of the Christians have, with slight modifi- cations been accepted by the Turlish Ministi, . On Saturday last, the 2d inst., these propositions were submitted to the Great Council, and likewise accepted. In a few days the official acceptance is expected. The Fourth Point may be thus regarded as settled in-principle. The next point,relating to the organization of the Principalities, wilU be the object of the next confer,. ences. I hear it is intended to settle this. point before the negotiations in Paris begin, min order to have thr iroject ready for discussion there., Ali Pasha, th"Gr'and Vizier, is appointed by the Turlish Government to proceed to Paris, and he* ill en4rk. next week in tlihereach.nsteh mter Ajaccio. The other Turkish member of tho conferences at Pars will' be MIehmed Bey, the Turkish l!inister at that place - Ali Paa's 1lacel during his absence, will be taken by Kibrisli Mehmed Pasha, but only as Vakil-that is his lieutenant. On the night of Friday or Saturday a fire brolke oiut in one of the kiosks of the palace of Haidar Pasha, inhabited by a detachument of the 13th Light Dragoons. It originated in the room of a narried soldier, and, in spite of all exertions which were made, consumed that wing of the building and most of the clothes and arms of the men. The whole rambling Palace of Haidar Pasha is a succession of wooden houses, most of them old and as easily ignited as tinder. Everyprecaution had been taken to prevent accidents. In the evening all fires had to be put out and patrols went round to aee that this was done. But it requires only a neglected spark to ignite this seasoned wood, which moreover, as all Turkish buildings, have a coating of oil-paint. The firemen sent out from England were on the spot in the very beginning, and, so little apprehensions did the fire excite at first, that they tried to put it out by throwing buckets of water on it, and the men, instead of removing their things, helped only to put out the fire. They did not know what the wooden houses of Constantinople are, and thus lost their baggage. Fortunately there was not a breath of wind, and so by great exertions the fire was confined to the kiosk where it had originated. Even the nearest building, separated only by a few yards from the kiosk and intended for a regimental. hospital, was saved. This was chiefly done by the zeal of a soldier of the 13th, who is by profession a fireman. He stood upon the fiail balcony of the threatened 3auilding and directed the hose of the fire engine; How great the danger was you may inagine, as the whole side of the building facing the fire is charred. The rest of the soldiers were not behind in their exertions and behaved very well. General Storks proceeded to tho spot as soon as he was informed of what had accurred, and superin. tended persona31ythe extinguishingof the fire. While there he had an accident. A piece of wall near which he was standing crumbled down and frightened his horse, which wheeled suddenly round and fell with him, without, however, hurting him seriously. Strangely enough the wind got up just after the fire was subdued, else it would have been impossible to have saved the rest of the palace and the newly erected stables, which are only separated by the road from the kiosk. The menwho have been deprived of their quarters by tne fire have been divided among the other regiments. An inquiry has been ordered to find out the cause of the fire, and punish those who were guilty of neglect. At the same time all stoves have been removed. As you will see from the sick list, the state of health is wonderfully good. From the 27th of January up to the 2d of Febrnary onlytwo deaths occurred in the hospitals. It was a very good plan to remove all healthy troops from the barrack hospital, and use it exclusively as a hospital. Letters have been received from Mlr. Mumray, dated from Tabreez. He had reached that place after a fatiguing journey of 26 days amid rain and snow, and could not continue his route to Mosul as he intended, on account of the heavy snowdrift, in which two caravans had been lost. I have received letters from Jassy, which speak chiefly of the protest of the most prominent Boyards of Moldavia against the validity of the so-called Divan ad hoc, instituted by the Convention of BaltaLiman, as the Supreme Legislative Coimcil of Moldavia. According to the separate treaty regarding the Danubian Principalities, and embodied in the treaty of .Adrianople,an extraordinary LegislativeAssembly was convoked both in Moldavia and Wallachia, which made a kind of constitution for them, known under the name of the " organic statute," and sanctioned by the Porte. In unison with the regulations contained therein, the legislative power was vested in an assembly composed of Boyards and of the deputies of the district. After the movement in 1849 this assembly was suspended, and, by the convention of Balta-Liman, a provisional legislative body was created, called " Divan ad hoc." This was to be composed of the high clergy and the highest secular dignitaries in the two provinces. As the choice of them was left'to the Princes of Moldavia and Wallachia they were anxious to compose it according 'to their convenience, and to exclude all those who would oppose any resistance to their wishes. Although the war with IRussia ought to have put an end to all the treaties with her, and consequently, to the convention of Balta-Liman, the same state of things was, and. is kept up still in the Principalities as if the treaty of Balta-Liman existed in full force. Nor did this stato of things excite any reclamations from the Principalities imtil now, when their moving spring is not patriotism, but private interest. The Prince of M;oldavia submitted, on the 9th of November last year, to the Administrative Council, a project for the enfranchisement of all serfs in Moldavia. The serfs belonging to the State domains, to the clergy, and to the monasteries, had been liberated previously by a law passed in 844, without any indemnity, and now only those belonging to private proprietors remain. In this project of Prince Ghika, it is proposed to emancipate these likewise against an indemnity to be paid to their proprietors. The Divan ad wo0 accepted this project, and a committee of two of'its members, besides the Ministers of Finance and Justice, have been named to carry out the details, to fix the amount of indemnity, and. to decide how it should be paid. This decision of the Divan ad 7Goc, so closely touching the purses of the Boyards, roused. their patriotism, and convinced them of the illegality of this Legislative Council. Not daring to oppose openly tXi special decision of the Council, they impeach its whole aathority. They have embodied their grievances in this respect in a petition addressed to the Stultan and signed with 61 signatures belonging to the most prominent men of M.oldavia. Baron fosemadesque, a Frenchman who has lived a long time in Mingrelia, being attached to the household of the Princess Dadian, has arrived here. Thenevws which he brings is veryre-assuring. Having been, until lately, with the Russians, his information about them may be trusted. He says that the troops on that side, even if favoured by the finest weather, could undertake nothing aggainst Omar Pasha's army, which is in undisturbed possession of the countay up to Koloni, and has its communication open with Suchuin Ealeh. The inhabitants seem to-be, on the other hand, better disposed than they were before. They are begin-ing to bring in provisions, chiefly Indian corn, for sale. 3avshi-Bazouik means, literally, confulsed head. In- this literal sense, the War Depatment disposing of the Bashi-Bazouks seems more Bashi-Bazonk than the real ones; at tShumla. Since: the departure of Brigadier-General Smith nobody knows who is the commander of the Bashis; the War Department seems to know it least. Brigadier-General Watts was left in command when General Smith IUft, but,' soon 'after, Brigadier-General Brett came out, with orders to take the comnand. -When it became known that he was appointed, a number of officers senior to 'him declared that they wiould not serve under him. General Shirley received, consequently, the- oirder to go up togShumlawith General Brett anE arnrane matters. He arrived. there. ou 'the 24th of last month. In tho meantime Brigadier-General Watts telegraphed to Lord Panmure, and. . the answer was, that he (Watt) should retain the coinmand. The next day, on the contrary, a letter arrived likewise from Lord Panmuro appointing Colonel HIaveloclk'tobe commander of the BashiBazo,uk. Thus the mxtter rests. After ihis small specimen of order and counter-order nobody oughlt tube surprised if the Basbis are in disorder.
LET U0 HArE AN INQUIBY. TO THE EDITOR OF TE TIM. Sir,-Lord Carrdigan demands inquiry into his condauct as commander of the extinct Light Brigade of 1854; I earnestly hope that his request may be complied with. His commanding officer and sever3l of theb colonels and captains of the regiments forming his brigade are now at home, and his official correspondence with Lord Raglan must by this time be in the archives of the Horse Guards. By all means let us have an inquiry into the causes of the utter destruction of one of the finest bodies of horsemeen that ever left this country. We road in Sir John IWNeiU's report that about the middle of the month of November, 1854, tho Light Brigade was stationed by Lord Raglan's order on a very exposed position, about seven miles from Balakdava, from which port their whole means of subsistence was derived. Wereadthataboutthat tiue the means of transport at the disdosal of the Commissariat utterly broke down; that the commnissary signified their break-down, and his consequent inability to feed the horses, to Lord Cardigan, suggesting, as the only means of keeping the animlal alive) that they should either bo moved nearer to Balklava, or that a portion of them should be daily sent dowrn -to carry up provenlder for the We read that Lord Cardigan declined to accede tothese suggestions, without himself proposing any preferable alternative. So the horses, within even miles of food and horse-clothing, remained on the bleak heights, naked and starvng; and when they had eaten straps, blankets, and-saddle 9aps they finally ate each otherfs mnanes and tails, and than died in great numbers. When about a third of them had expired the remainder were led down to Balaklava, so weak that they coulld no longer, carzy their riders,-so weak that 17 actually dropped dead during that short jouney. The only excuse that can be pleaded for this strange and wanton destruction is, that an attack from the Russians was imminent, and that the presence of the Light iBrigade at that particular point WaS necessary to " impose" upon the enemy. The rword " impose" I select advisedly, because as combatants the Light Division must have been utterly useless, their horses being in such a sinking state. But, if this excuse is to hold good, we have a geht to ask whether the General commanding this devoted brigade was 'ever at his post, visitW' his sentries by night, sleeping in his clothes, rendy at any moment to turn out his men and face the enemy. Not he; During all tlat critical period I am assured that Lord Cardigan was living -in luxury on board his private yacht in the harbour of Balaklava, seven miles offl Lord Raglan was actually obliged to vnite an official letter to him, to forbid his exhausting the wretched horses of his brigade by employmg them in carrying messages between his camp on the heights and-the Enchantress yacht, on board which he lived. If ill-health justified the marine residence which he preferred, Lord aordigan ought surely to have resigned his command, as .Sir De Lacy Evans did when he could no longer do his duty as he felt a General's duty ..ought to be done. Imagine Sir George Cathcart or Sir Colin Campbell commanding divisions before .lebastopol from on board private yachts in,. the harbour of Balaklava I Had the Russians attaclked the.camp of the Light Division by night, as we are told they were expected to do, they would have discovered that its commandina officer was afloat, seven miles off, comfortably in bed ! Lord Cardiganin a public speech attributed his early return home to ill-health and "t other circnmstances." Lord Hardinge must know what those circumstanceswere; yet, in the face of them, he appointed Lord Cardigan Inspector-Geneyal of Cavalry at home, employing him to regenerate in England the very force which he had so wantonly wasted in the East. 1, too, know what those eircumstances were; if any member of the House of Commons will move for copies of Lord Cardigan's correspondence inth Lord Lucan and Lord Raglan, bearing upon hiis 4uarres 'with and complaints against the former nobleman, the public'will at once discover how il it has been served and how grossly it has been imposed upon. I am Sir. vour obedient servant. A CIV.tLAN.
CHARaE OF AMANSLAUGHTER AGAI.AST 2tJYO ARAMY SURGBO&S. CHAIHAMI, TIntSDAY. Tis morning Mr. Thoras Hlills, one of the coroners for the coonty, held an inquest at the Queen's Eead, Brompton, on the body of 'William Stinson, a private in the 38th Regimnvt, who, it was sthted, met with ais death ih the Garrison thospital in consequence of having had a la-e dose of laudanum administered to him in mistake for a dose of se , and which mistake occurred in consequenc of the alleged culpable negrligence of the surgeons on duty at the hospitaL lat was also stated that another man to whome the wrong medicine had also been given was not ehpected to lire. The jury havin6 viewped the body, which lay at the hospi't31, the following evidence was taken . Atnusltus Prederick Turner, assistant-surgeon, dwnth Re ment, havin been cautioned by the coroner, stated that the decoased bad beon in tho GarrisonHospitalhsice the 13th of January last to bhe treated for a disease in the leg. On Sunday evening witness had. occasion to visit him in the ward, and ordered a purgative draught for him and another ient. Witness wlent into the surgery and took donm, as thought, the bottl containien the senna, from aibch he poured six ounces into a cup held by the orderly. That qunantity wfas for the twvo men, deceased anda soldier namned Breman, of the 431st Re uent. The fiuid he poured out was of a dark colour, and the bottle he took it from was of the same sizeoa the other bottle, and contained no label on the side nearest witness. He did not know until the follpwing morning that a mistake had been miade iu the medicine, and that one of the men was dead. - James Talbot said he was hospital orderly at the barrack, and about 10 o'clock on Sunday evening went into the surery for a purging mixture for deceased and another man. r.Turnerpouredit out into a tin cup,and wvitness gave the contents to deceased and the other man. While deceased was taking it he remarked that it was a very curious taste for that medicine. Between 1l and 12 o'clock deceased was taken as if dying, and witness ran for Mr. Bedwell, the surgeon. That ntleman came directly, and gave deceased a mixture, butnhe could not swallow it. So said he w as in a fit, and went away, but returned saon after and told vitfiess to apply something hot to his feet, and if he got worse to call him. Deceased, however, never ralied, and died soon afterwards. They afterwards discovered that it was tincture of opium which had been given the mien. The other man was veryii], and, after great trouble, was rescued from danger. Ross Hassard, surgeon of the Royal Artilei7, said he had seen the cup containing a portion of the medicine given deceased, which, it was evident, wvas tincture of opium. Three ouncesof laudanumwoeuld contain 74grains of opium, four gains being suffcient to cause death. " It was quite possible, if judicious means had been used, that deceased would have recovered." If a medical man had either smelt or tasted the mi-ture given the deceased he world have discovered it was opium. It is of the same colour as the comm on pgtive draught. The purgativebottlewasnotlabeDede ore the accident. By Mr. ?rall, -who appeared for 3r. Turner.-The store bottle contaiing thee opiun was left out of its place. It was perfectly possible thatthe label on the opium bottle might not have been seen. V)nmcan Ronnie, assistant sordeon, 10th Re,inent, said he made the peast oremF exaunation, and there 'was no doubt that deceased died frbu the effects of laudanunn. Henry Bedcwell, acting-assistant-sumrgeon, having been caiutioned by the coroner, said he was caled to the deceased' between U and 12 on Sunday night, and found him suffering from what he supposed to be a fit. There was nothing particular about his pUlse. Witness prescribed some aolphuri ether fof him. He was very restless, and there-was a difficulty in 'ois swalowing, the medicine. Witness con. sidered him to be in a drowsy state fro* the effects of the fit, and left him; aftrtelling't'e attendants to keep'the body warm' and to call him again if necessary. He was told the man had talken some opening medicine: Witness was caliedto huin soonerw arand found lhim,as he suppo3ed, still suffering from the fit.- The orderly slowed him the medicine deceasedlhad taken, but witness was suffering froiu _ bad cold and could not smell it. He had not been in the habit of tasting medicines. He thonuht it useless to administer anything to him, as it woould only irritate him. The orderly came and reported his death soon afterwards. -Thomas Cornwall, 'the sergeant in charge of the medical stores, said he was engaged on the Sunday eveningreplenish- ing the bottles in the surgery, but while doing so was called' to dO something else. Heput the opium bottle, which was of the same size as the senna bottle, down, and it was then moved by some one. The bottle remained on the couater til the following morning. The Coroner then summed up the evidence 'with great 'care, pointing out the lavrof the case. The jury retired, and, after an absence of nearly-twoo hours 'returned a verdict of '"Ma3slau,,hter" against Aw s iFrederick Turner and'Henrh Bedwell.

THE UNITED STATES. tvnn%r rwrrs? nmoz fn3?vvqv?vnvvr It ' ~ ~~ 1EW YORl'Ps, F . The Central American debate in the Setate hs been continued since my last by Mr. Seward, who delivered a long oration yesterday. The tone of this speech had been previously foreshadowed by rumour. As comning from the acknowledged head of the Iteublican party, who wields au inluence upon public opuuon in the north unequalled by that of any other senator, this speech merits attention. The American construction of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty is fully upheld. Of the objects of this treaty the senator says:- " It-s a great treaty, subline in its conuceptiongescrous in its spirit, and beneficent in its purposes. The two nival members of the British family, after long and angry alienation, met, not within the territoryof either, but on that foreign and narrow isthmus which, while it suites North and South America, divides the vigorous Atlantic States of Europe and America from the inmusturo American States and the decyed Asiatic nations which, on opposite coasts, overlook the broad Pacific-the last remaining one of tho barriers which nature had erected to hinderthe estoration of the unity of the hmnan race. "The truee they made there was not cffcted without mutual self-denial, acquired under the discipline of free government. Great Britain repressed a constitutional ambition that ba) long conv,lsed the worild. The United States subdued one that nature prompted and tho voice of mankind applauded and encouraged. Iet not that macred truce be broken and these friendly Powers engage in deadly strife and discord, and violence be thus let loose to arest the progress of the nations. Better for tho pride of each that the white cliffs that ganison the coast of Enga sink into a black and pestilential morass, And that Niagara lose for ever its deep-toned voice and ooze through a Vulgar channel to tho sea, than that the great and sonorous concordjEthus established between them be rudely broken. I counsel you, senators and statesmer, of the United States, by all the motives that are born in the love of such a land as ours, in such an age as this-I counsel the senators and statesmen of Great Britain, by all the motives that greatness and amnSffio like her own will Lot permit tohe ibadive topreserve and maintain, at all costs and hazards, and through all dis. contents and jealousies, this great treaty. Loettlhs politica rainbow stand, stretching from the skdes downwards on either side to tho horizon, a pledgo that any of tho nations shall not again he overwbelmed by the after-coming deluge of human passions."' Ho reviews the claim to the Iosquito Protec. torate, and arTives at the conclusion that, " Under no circumstances could the fiction of a Mosquito King, kingdom, or protectorate be tolerated to deprive the United States of continental rights, guaranteed to them by treaties with the Central American States. But it would oe Consenting to the practice of a fraud against them and ousebl-es to tolerate such efforts, after the treaties of 1783, 1786, and 1a50. The settlement at the Balize he claims should be restricted to the rights acquired from Spain uinder the treaties of 1783 and 1786, to which he says they were limited by the treaty which recognized the independence of Mexico; und of the Bay Iiland colony (which is really the question at issue) he says- Whatever pretensions Great Britain may have ever be. fore made to tho Bagy flands, they wero all solemnly and for everrolinquished and abandoned by her in the treaty of 1850."y He then passs beyond the questions at ise to the means of settling them. War he regards as a- cala-. mity and an evil, and war with Great lritin an event to bedeplored morethan anything else. Wise counsels can avoid it. There is room enough in the world for both, and the influence of CGreat Britain on this continent is fadin away, he says, and wdl disappear in the awy esas n ill disappear in th- natural cor-se of events. -Still more is it to be regretted that war is made possible when the Western nations are contending "against an advancing despotism-" "Nevertheless, a war with Great Britaia is now aonorg the possible solutions of the present embarrasment. We certainly can look for no mnoderation on her part hereafter, if we overlook her persistent refusl to flfil this, the most solemn and important of aU our international engagements. It will be an idle dream to suppose ourselves free and safe if we leave her to waylay us on all sides of our Isthmus pas, sages from our Atlantic regionl to the Pacific States." Wre have passed, he says, the time when we should propose arbitration; but "Great Britainmay reconsider, may propose to us a reference, or some other amicable adjustment." This he would be ready to hear, and to go to 'he very verge of accommodation; and for this purpose, he says_; "My counsel, therefore, is a notice to Great Britain that we shall interfere to prevent her exercise of dominion in South America, if it shall not be discontinued within one year; and also that auathority be now given to the yresi. dent to execute that delayed purpose." This speech is artfully framed. A carefulreading has satisfied me that the speaker had in view the peaceful settlement of the questions at issue. He throts out the orly course that now seems -feasible-a reference to arbitrators, on the suggestion of the British Government. The President'3 fessage, you will remember, leaves the question very mnuch in the same way. The debate in the Senate on MIonday (to which I listened) brought out a bulk- of testimony in favour of tho American construction of the treaty. Mr. Clayton and Mrr. CoDlamore, who were both members of General Taylor's Cabinlet during the -whole negotiation, spoke positively of the views whlich they entertained when they accepted the treaty. The language of the 1st Article is as follows:- "Art. L Neither party will ever obtain or maintain for itself any exclusive control orer the contemplated canaL "Neither will ever erect or maintain anyfortification commanading the same or the vicinity thereof. "Neither will occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume, or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua, Costa Pica, the Mosquito coast, or any part of Central America. " Neither will use any protection which either affords or may afford, or any alliance which either has or may have, to or with any State or people, for the purpose of erecting or maintaining any such fortifications, or of occupying or colonizing Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito cont, or any part of.CentraJ Americaor of assuming or exercisingany dominion over the same. "- Neitherwill takeadvantage of any intimacy,oruse any al"ance, connexion, or infizenoe that either may possesg with any State or people through whose territory the canal may paisa for the purpose of acquiring or holding, directly or in y, for its own citizens or subjects, any unequal rights or advalntages of commerce or navigation." Mr. CoIlamore, especially, spoke at lengi upon the object of the insertion of the words " assume or exercise,"> and the clause concerning the use of the protectorate. A letter from Mir. R. Johnson was also read. He was also a member of General Taylor's Cabinet at that time. The views of these gentlemen were consistent and positive on these points, and call for a statement of Sir Henry' Bulwer's views on this clause and his interpretation when he signed the treaty; and especially 'whether Mr. Clayton was made acquainted with those Views. Unless I am imstaken, it will appear positively that Sir Henry Bulwer's views of this treaty, as well as1Lord Palmerston's were, essentially diffeaent fromr those of the Anerican CaObiiet. I think it wvil appear that even the occupation of the Bay Islands, and, most of al, Ruatan, was known, and the purpose of the British Government to continue the occupation pointed out. The American Government have never assented to this occupation. It has always claimed to limit tGreat Britain to her rights under the teaties of '83 and 8g. Our foreign relations are complicated further by the claim to capture Russian vessels sold to neutral after the commencement of the -war-a claim whici the Cabinet at Washington pUrpose esising. Mr,. Dallas, the newly-appointed inister to England, has accepted, and will doubtles be fuly instructed on these several points. _ -

AIfONB Y.MAR)BTandrCITY. NTRIGBZWN. Wm Thursday Evening. The English funds opened with increvengbuoy.ny this morning, and were well maintained up to the oS'cialce. After reguar hours, however, there was a considerable reaction. Consols for money, whicli left off yesterday at 91i to 92, were first quoted 92 to -. They then ranged between 91l and 92i, the latest authorized transactions being at 92 formoney and 92. for the 11th of March. Subaequently a sudden fall occurred, until there were sellers for the account at 92k, but at the latest momentthere were buyers at thatprice. Thecauseof the decline consisted in a rumour that the Government intend to fund the nine millions of Exchequer-bills now becoring due, and the notice forthepayingoff'of which may be looked for at the beginning of next week. With regard to the accuracy of the report, nothing of an official character transpired, but it is generally considered that in the present state of the money-market, even if the rate of interest on these bills.should be raised, it will certainly be necessary for a portion of them to be withdrawn by funding, to enable the remainder to float. Bank Stock closed at 214to 215; Reduced, 92 toA; New Three per Cents., 93; Long Annuities, 3j, Annuities, 1885, 16 11-16; India Stock, 224 to 225; Exchequerbonds, 97.1 to 98; and India-bonds and Exchequerbills, 7s. to 4s: discount. The pressure for money in the Stock--Exchange to-day was extraordinary, and was much increased by the settlement in the foreign market. Instances eccurred of 7 per cent, being paid for short loans on (loverrnent securities. Foreign securities were more freely operated in, and some descriptions showed a slight tendency to improvement. In Turkish Six per Cents. the tsacions for money were at 93k, 94, 93-, k, and , and for the 3ccount at 94, 9&, and i. the Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock was negotiated at l10k and 101 for money and 1014 for the account. The general business comprised-Buenos Ayres, 156; Ecuador, 5 ; Granada Deferred, 7; Mexican, for money and account, 20k; Peruvian Three per Cents., for account, 56W ; Portuguese Four per Cents., 4&J ; the Small, ex. ill overdue Coupons, 44k; Russian Five per Cents., 105; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 43; Venezuela, for account, 29i; and i; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certiicates, 95 and i. t2he losing quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourso this evening were 73f.L 3c for money and 74f. 10c. for the end of the monthl, showing a further improvement of threeeighths per cent. At Vienna, also, the market exhibits renewed firmness. The insertion of the following letter may prove useful, because it gives expression to an opinion which is being strongly fostered in the city, especially by the influence of legal minds, that the new partnership bill will require the introduction of a clause for the compulsory registration of loans. The wsriterquotes the continental practice as regards partners en co mnandife, and considers an imitation of it to be essential for the protection of the public. A greater fallacy could not be advocated. So strong, however, is the propensity of a large class to prevent a principle from beingadopted in its purity that the point is probably one on which all the Government povers of resistance will have to be exercised. The oroundwork of the Government measure is the abolition of the paternal system, and the recognition that in all contracts people must be left to their own vigilance and free wil. It is now contended, however, that a little piece of compulsory protection must stilI be preserved. The right of one man to lend money to another on such conditions of remuneration as may mutually be deemed expedient is not to be admitted unless he will forego the privacy which all persons are entitled to exercise in their pecuniary affairs. He may carry on all other business transactions, lend money on bond, or annuity, or at specified rates of discount, without being aDled upon to report his movements to a Government oflice, but in this instance he is not to be at liberty to act, except upon that condition. The plea is that if a person should commence business, stating himself to be supported by a loan from Baron Rothschild, or any other great capitalist, he would still, although such loan might subsequently be withdrawn. contrive to get credit upon the strength of it, unless there were some ystem of registration to showr that it had been so withdrawvn. We must, it is said, protect the pubEic front the possibility of being thus deceived. They cannot take care of themselves, and the State must takecare ofthem. Let thisbeconceded,andthewhole principle of the bill may at once be given up. The operation of such a clause can be clearly seen beforehand, and, instead of checking fraud and promot-ing stability, it would open the door to an endless amount of chicanery and the discouragement of all those classes whose prudent co-operation in commercial transactions is most to be desired. Suppose no hregistration to exist, if a man gets credit, he must then get it upon hri own simple representations. He may say that Baron Rothschild has lent him lO,OOlt., but it will be for the person trasting hin to believe that statement or not, as he pleases. That which the persn giving credst has to do is to satisfy imself the transaction is likely to be secure; but he has no right to expect the assistance of the State to enable him to arive at that conclusion. If hexcannot do soby ordarymeans, hissimple course is to declinethe business. Hisareewill is perfect, and n caseof gan or loss heohastonly hiselftothanw. On theroher hand, sapposing a system of registration in force, henever any disaster occurs the cry wil be that trust was given because the person was shown to be supported by a great capitalist. "I }knew little of his character," the creditor may exclaim, "and dd not trouble myself about his mode of doing business. I saw he was backed by "fN. So and So, and I thought all safe." The law therefore, will h act as a direct stimulmsto credit beig given not on a man's pernal character, but upon vague inferences as to the probability of some one continuing to support him. It willnalso ultimately operate to deter capitalists from givingn assistance. When applied to, the answer willobf e " No. I lent such an. one 1O,OOOI., and when he failed all his creditors said they had trusted him on the strength of mynazne, and thatit wasmy duty1 to-car him through. I did not mind the loss of -my loan, but I do not wish a repetition of such reproaches. It was the business of the creditors in that case tobhave relied only on their own judgment of the character of the person with whom they were dealing. I had neither tine nor opportunity to watch his operations, but they preferred to run the risk of my supporting him as a protegd, and theyshallUnotagainha-ve a similaropportunity." This, however, is not alL Let the State grant registration, anidthey are bound, if it is to be anything else than a snare, to see that the loan so registered has been absolutely paid over, and also to keep an eye that it is not surreptitiously withdrawn. Collushin would be easy to enahle a man to appear a great capitalist by figuring on the register as having any amount of money out on partnership Ioans, while others in a similar mananer might a ppear to have great sums lent to them. Yet, white the Ja* would thus facilitate the objects of persons not worth a farthing, it might by the very same means put an additional check to loans by the actual possessors of property. A really rich merchant might say,.- "The world know nothing of my actual wealth, and if they see that I have 100,OOOI. risked in partnership loans they may fancy I have been imprudent, and have not kept a sufficient reserve for my own business." Anything more self-defeating than such a system, or more calculated to betray the public, could therefore scarcely be conceived ; and when it is recog-nized that these are merely a fei of the principal evfls and absurdities to which it would leadT, and that among a multitude of minor ones is the fact that, whEie the original regixtration of a loan would lead to false inferences of credit, its withdrawal wouldbe equally liable to inNict damoage on credit, although the borrower mig)t then be in a perfectly sound condition, it will cite surprise that the idea of contending for it cau possibly be entertained. If money once lent is improperly withdrawn, the existing bankruptcy las afford a perfect remedy. The preferential payment must be refuided, and the bankrupt must mbmit to the penalties provlided for such conduct. Any attemptto deIlude creditors that it is in the rowrer of the State to provide some better protection an official formality can have no other end than t;hat which has attended all previous exaples of Government meddlinlg: "Sir,-Admitting the necessity for a new partnershi biI, I wrould sti beg to offer the following remarks - c±tinl7 would open &door to fraud if sleeping partners could silently and unobeerved withdraw their capitsl, the introduction of which probably had been loudly announced by tie acting partners in order to improve their credit. To entitle a sleeping partner (partner e convwndi4e, for an acting paertnr cnnot Justly claim alimi. a to Ida o liability) to the keat of a limitd liabi I lity it should be indispensable that the amount of his capital brought into associstion with another acting partner or partners be duly registered and that consequently the $leepg pTtner remaiis 11ihle to that extent, until the tvithdral of all or any parb of his capital has becn duly registered with equal pubcity! Abroad these acts are registered, at a very small expense, by the sworn publio notaries incorporated for that purpose. The registers of parterlships of everg' kind, entered into or dissolved, should here, as abroad, he open for inspection for a limited time, -free of aU expemse, at all the public offices of registration in all te principal commercialtovns, and afterwards bound together and systematically arranged, remain aocesible to inspection on. payment of a fixed small fee, somewhat increa after a time in proportion to the trouble ococsioned by the reference. *$ G." he commtercial advices from New York to-day do not show an average improvement in the stockmarket of more than two or three per cent. in consequence of the news of peace, several lare hoiders, doubting its character, having apparently taken the opportunity to effect realizations. In the wheat-market, however, it had created a temporary paralyis. The expectation of an improvement in the rate of exchange has been realized, and the preEent steamer has brought 7,0001. A few failures had been announced, among whom were Bacon, Price, and Co., extensive coal dealers in Philadelphia; J. T. Rtockwood and CO. dealers in imported goods at Springfield, hIassachusetts, with liabilities tor 16,0001.; and H. W. Bigelow, of Chicago, in the same business, wtth liabilities for 26,0001. The latter had failed twro or three times before, and now offers equal to 10s. in the pound, payable in a year. A special meeting of the South Sea Company was held to-day, MIr. C. Franks presiding, when a report was presented in relation to its final liquidation. According to the general account, the total of remaining assets, including Exchequer-bills, Indiabonds, &c., is 137,9051.; and, after deducting 44,0001., to be transferred to the names of trustees, to meet outstanding liabilities, unleaimed dividends, &c., and 3641. for the payment of rent and salaries, the amount divisible is 93,5411. A distribution at the rate of 5 per cent. on 1,864,7351. South Sea Stock will absorb 93,2361., leaving a small balance of 3001. The payment of this 5 per cent. (which is to be made from the 21st inst. to the 20th of' March) will including the 11.5 per cent. already returned, make a total of 120 per cent., without the least interference with the payment of dividends having taken place during the progress of dissolution. With regard to the 44,0001. carried to the credit of the trustees, it will be retained to meet whatever liabilities may arise, but after the lapse of the stipulated date for the exercise of their powers the balance, if any, is to be rateably divded. The Mnaller sum of 3001., or any increase that may arise from interest, &c., up to 4001., is to be left to the appropriation of t.he directors, who propose to giveadditional remujieration to some of the officers, whose labours through the winding up have latterly been increased. The successful result attending the realization of the assets, unaccompanied by the interference of Chancery, was a subject of congratulation, and the report, together with a special resolution, ;was unanimously passed, to enable the subSovernor and the Court of Assistants to carry out their views. Votes of thanks were also tendered to MIr. Franks and his colleagues for their caution and judgment, and the former, in reply, intimated that it was the last time they would meet as proprietors of the South Sea Company, the corporation being now virtually dissolved. The colonial wool sales commenced to-day, with an unusually lrge attendance of buyers. The biddngs were very animated, and prices may be quoted from 1id. to 2d. per lb. higher than at the closing sales of last series. The total quantity to be offered is about 40,000 bales. The dividends on the Danish Five per Cents. and the Peruvian Four-and-a-Hlf per Cents, have been advertised. The agents of the Danish Government have also published the particulars of the bonds recently drawn for payment.

The directors of The1National Guardian Assurance Society have the honour of submitting to their constituents their report of the operabions and progrers of the society during the year 18'5. In the augmentation of income, the followinmr statement will showr the extent of new business tramnacted during the year. The directors have had submitted to them 918 propDosala ior the asurance of 7rte,we p ortr vtre }snitgFer t^ots?aof bu3t not comn for the assurance of £193232; thesebave beendispesedo£aWo- 577 polices effected for the assurance of . . 117,96 346 proposals declined, or not carried out 03,256 29 pmosrals accepted, but not completed 4,750 51 Un er consideration .10,20 1.963 £193,232 Theenew policiesthus issued wil give to the society an incomeof £44070 10s. 7d. w'he assurances now in existence under policies of the society are re=resented by 2.279 policies for the amrance of £396,915, and proddng an annual income of £1F,207 9s. IOdE The directors think it right to advert to the fact that the xna'orpaxt of these claims occurred in connexion with the earlier poicies of the society, over which they had no control; this is illustrated by the circumstance that no poliy accepted by the companyduringthopast 18 months has become a cbum. Since the last annual meeting the directors have determined torelinqnish the guarantee business: they did not find that the benefit ac ig therefrom was conimensurate with the risk involved. They are now limiting their efrorts to ife business exclusively. The directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum on the pai-up capitalofthe society: such dividend to be made payable on the 30thorMarchand the 30th of Sptember. in PUrsua3hOe of the provisions of the deed of settlement, J.

(Before Vice-CkeanccVor Sir W. P. WooD.) SIR JAI BROOKE, 0 LC.31, V. -ISE. This case comes before the Court for argument on a plea for want of parties, which, coupled with an answer as to the discovery, has been filed by the defendant to the plaintil's cross-bilL This latter document in its printed form is presented in the shape of a quarto volume of nearly 200 pages. The original suit, which has already been before the Court on interlocutory applications on more than one occasion, was instituted by the defendant Wise against Sir James Brooke, for the purpose of obtaiing a decreo for account and dissolution in respect of a partnership alleged to have been constitutea between them (in the year 1845), in the district and territory of Sarawak, an in all the profits, emoluments, and advantages arising therefrom, as well by the sale of antimony ore, and by other trading operation, as otherwise. The terms of partnership were aleged to be contained in a memorandum of agreement, dated the 20th of Febrnary, 1845, signed by Sir James Brooke. To this bil an answer was put iny Sir James, and the present cross-bill filed by him against Mr. Wise, whereby he seeks to have the memorandumn of agreement of the 20th of February, 184I, set aside by the decree of the Court, and delivered up to be cancelled; an account of all sums received and paid b the defendant Wise as his agent; to have set aside a letter dated the 6th of October, 1847, from himself to the defendant, and the transfer or gift thereby made by him to tho defendant of the grant of the right to work coal by the Sultan of Borneo, and to have the letter itself delvered up to be cancelled; and the bill further prays that if the Court shonld, be of oPimon that the partnership accounts prayed by Vise's bill should be taken, then that he (Wise) may be charged in those accounts with certain losses incurred by him; and further that if the Court should be of opinion that Sir James is not entitled to set aside the gift or transfer of the right to work coal by the Sultan of Borneo, and that the defendant is entitled to any relief in respect of the alleged partnership, then that the said grant of the right to work coal, and the sums received by the defendant in respect thereof, may be treated as partnsrsbip property. The grnt to work coal above referred to was contained in a memorandum of agreement dated the 23d of August, 1846, under the state sealof his Highness Omar Alie Safeidin, the Sultan of Borneo, whereby the whole of the coal found in the country extending from Mteng Kaboag as far as Tanjong Barram was granted to Rajah Brooke on certain terms. The letter of the 6th of October, 1847, was in these words:- "My dear Wisc,-The British Government having approved your holding the privileges relative to the coal on the mainland of Borneo conceded by the Sultan of Borneo I have now the pleasure of handing to you the SuItan's formal grant thereof, together with an official translation of the same, and agreeably to my former communications with you on this subject I make over to you and relinquish in your favour, absolutely and unconditionally, all interest, claim, or demand I can possibly have therein, sincerely trusting that the result may abundantly fulfil the expectations that have been formed respecting it." To this bil the defendant Wise filed a plea and answer as above stated. The grounds of the plea areas folow :- That by a deed dated the 13th of July, 1848, made between certan persons of the first part, the defendant Wise of the second part, and the Eastern Archipelago Company of the third part, r certain memorandum of agreement, dated the 2d of June last, was ratified and confirmed, whereby the defendant had agreed to grant to the company, on its complete formation, for the term of 21 years, his interest under a certain agreement for a Crown lease therein mentioned, and also the right of worldng the coal on the mainland of Borneo, in consideration of the payment to him bythe company of a gross sum of 6,0001., and of a further annual sum of 3,0001. in every year during the first 10 years of the existence of the company; that by the deed in question the defendant had assigned to the company all his right and interest in the said agreement for a Crown lease, and also in the said grant, to the end that the same, and the benefits to be derived therefrom, might be enjoyed by the company; that before the filing of the plaintiff's bill the deed was duly executed by the defendant, and sealed with the corporate seal of the company, and was also executed by certaiu persons named in the p ea, who were registered shareholders in the company; that the company was stil subsisting, and had never been dissolved; that by another deed, dated April 8, 1863, the defendant had assigned to the company al his right anditerest in the said graut of coal for al his estate and interest; that the sum of 6,0001., stipulated to be paid to the defendant by the company, had bceen duly paid;* that under the deeds of the 13th of July 1848, and the 8th of April, 1803, the regisered. shareholders in the Eastern Archipelago Company named in the plea claim to be, and are entitled as such shareholders and partners inthe company, and oabehalf of themselves and the other partners or shareholders to all the benefit of the said grant of coal from the Sultan of Borneo, and to the benefit of the transfer or gift thereof made to the defendant by the plaintiff's letter of the 6th of October, 1847, and that they or some or one of them ought to be made parties, or a: party, to the pLaintiff's bill. Mr. Rolt and. Mr. Ereeling appear in support of the plea; Mr. Willcock and MIr. Selwyn in support of the The arguments, which are to a great extent of a technical nature, were not concluded at the rising of the Court, and will be resumed to-morrow (this morning).

It turned out, however, that the plaintiff'q wife had been equally ready with "the retort courteous" Fin phrases equally offensive, and the parties thereupon agreed to withdraw a juror.

Thesiger, Mr. Wi3de, and Mr. Tomlinson appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff is the owner of the brig Pilot, ana this war an action to recover 2,4001., the value of that vessel and her cargo of coals, alleged to have been lost in consequence of that vessel having been negligently ran down by the Esther, a ship belonging to the defendant, on the 3d of lYovember last. It appeared that the Pilot was on her voyage from Cardiff up the English Channel on the night of the 3d of November, when, the wrind blowving a gale, writh a "-nasty short sea"' rmnning, she came into co'lision, off the Isle of *Wlght, writh the E.ther, a large guano-laden ship, also going *np Charnde. The case presented the usual contradictions observable in actions of the class to wvhich it belonged, hut ended, unike most of them, in an expression of opiion by the jury, during the progress of the evidence for the defence, that the collision between the two vessels was "the result of anavoidable aecident." This intimation led to a conference between the learned counsel, and presentlyit was announced that it had been agreed to withdraw a juror in this cause and to stay all further proceedings in a crossaction between the same parties. The CHrDa B.u%oN approved this arraugement, and so all litigation between the parties was put an end to. JOYCE V. =Uu LONDON AN-D BLACKWALn nAILWAY COArPrA,Y. Mr. Sesieant Wilkns and Mr. Wordsworth were counsel for the plaintiff; Sir F. Thesiger, Mxr. Knowvles, and mr. Davison appeared for the defendants. The plamtiff is a merchant of the city, and this was an action n which he sought to recover certain expenses to which he had been put in consequence of the breach of a contract entered into with the defendants for his conveyance by railway and steamer conjointly from London to Marlate on the 1st of September last. It appeared that the plaintiWs family being lodged at Margate, he, at 4 o'clock on the day above named, took a ticket at Fenchurch-street station to go, " vid Thames Haven," to MarTgate, for which he paid 2s. 6d. The temptation held out by this insignificant fare for such a journey induced nearly 40 people to go to Margate by this r out4 who, when the train reached Thames Haven, flocked on board the Magician steamer at about half-past 5 o'clock. The good ship then set out, but after passing the Nore, and when within 25 miles of Margate, the weather became so bad that the captain, fearful of attempting the perilous navigation of the channel with such a living cargo, tarned back to Tilbury, there to wait till the voyage could be resumeda At Tilbury the captain offered to send back all those who might wish to go to London by the train grataitously. Some availed themselves of this offer, but the great mAjority of the passengers were anxious to go on. Among these were the plaintiff, snd five -others, who, finding that it was very inconverdnaitet6stay -in the vessel, determined to go across to Gravesend, but before going they endeavoured to ascertain fromn the captain wvhen they ought to roturn. According to the statement of these gentlemen the capt&in assured them repeatedly thaLt if they were back by 3 o'lock next momning they would be in plenty of time, as he should not resume his voyage before tht hour. The plaintiffandothers upon thisewent across and spentthe nightat Gravesend, where they had some supper, whence'they returned in a wzherry at halfpaSt 1 g'dclck, Wliep tley axrived a'§ Tilbary, how. ever, they found to their dismav that the 11*cian hd sailed at half-past 12 o clock. hnis compelled tem to go back to Gravesend, and after great trouble they there pro. cured a conveyrncet o ate, where they rrived atl @clock on Snday fternoon,. The expensestowhichthe plaintiff was put he estimated at about 3!., and forthat sun orthereabouts thir*ction was brought. On the part of the defendants the defence was rested en the shnple assertion that the captain had never pledged himself to the plaintiff unconditionally not to start tid 3 o'elock, butlhad all along, when pressed by the pamengers tofx atime for his departure, sothatthey mngthaveas muchl time at Gravesend as possible, expressly given notice that he should stay till 3 o'dclck if the weather did not clear ip, but that be should start as soon as the weather moderated, and that all who left the vessel for Gravesend must do so at their peril. In confirmation of this version of the captain's conduct it was shown that, in order to keep the pasengers on board, the vessel was taken out into tho stream, where the anchored, with her fires up, and lay till the weather moderated, on the rising of the moon at 12 o'clock, when she started on her voyage, reaching Margate at 6 o'clock Mr. Serjeant Wn.xms having rephed, The CELnt BAnoN left it to the iury to say whether they 'were satisfied that the captain had made tbe express promise reliedonbythe plaintif, or had only given the general notice as asserted by the defendants. Wltim tely ajuror ws withdrawn SECOND COURT. (Sitting6 at Gui dJW, in Commitc-room No. 1, at NIr Prius, afWrHaitry Term, bcforc Mr. A!aron3nLRand Common Juries.) ALDER V. DEHC. fr. Carter was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. IL Ch=abes (with Mr. T. Jones) conducted the came for the defendant. This was an action by which the plaintiff sougbt to Tecover the sum of 5171. 1s&., forarrears of salary, and other moneys which the plaintiff alleged were due and ovwing to him from the defendant. It appeared that the defendaut has for several years taken andcdrriedoe:t a series of contracts for making sewers under the Board in Greek-street, and that during a portion of these works the present plaintiff vws in his employ as superintendent, or overlooker. After a time the plaintiff began to take small subcontracts, and subsequently more extensive suhcontracts, until he was no longer able to perform all is former duties under the defendant. The result was that the defendant was obliged to appoint another person to thesituation. Thedefendant, however, stillattimes employed the plaintif Ultimately the latter fell into some difficulties, andthen it was that he applied to the defendant for a sum of 201. on account of salary. This sum the Latterwho said that he did not know thathe owed him anythingreplied, he would let him have onhis giving him a receiptin full of all demands, adding that if he would go to his mianager he woald be able to inform him whether anything or nothing was owing to him, and that if there was any sum due hewonldsin a check for theamount. Thiscourse, however, the plaintiff did not think proper to adot, tt some time sabsequently commenoed the present action. The defence was that there was not one shilling owing to the plaintif, and in proof of this fact the daily and weekly work; and pay papers were put in and read, fromw0ich it appeared that in every case where the plaintiff had beenx empoyed for the defendant in his work,e had been paid n n usua1 way. Mr. CARTER having repEiedat great length, Mtr. Baron MrARTD summed up The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. 3301D V. HIMD. Mr. M. Chambers, with Mr. Petersaorft, conducted the case for the plaintiff; and MIr. Knowles, with MIr. F. H. Lewis, appeared for the defendant. This wasan action to recover for 661. 1. 4d. (or33!. Xn 3d.) under the following circunstances.- The defendant is a grocer, and some time last year, by the advice of his solicitor, caUed a meeting of his creditor to whom he made an offer to pay a composition of l0s. in the pound. Several of the creditors, among them the present plaintiff,,2peared dissatisfied with the proposal, and reseed for 12s. , but this it was positively stated on behalf of the defendant it vas imrpossible for him to carry out. He was closdy questioned m reference to some pro. perty it was understood he had come into through his wife. This property it was stated had been sold, subje^t to a mortgage of 1,200L, and the surplus reaied by that se about 500!L, had been expended 11 the improvement of the defendant's house in Pentonvile. The creditors, the naority of them at all events, consented to sign the composition deed for lb., and when the plaintiff was called upon he said that if a particular creditor signed, he would; but in the end he refused, and brought his action. Mr. Baron MaDnTn told the jury that, as a matter of law, there was no evidence for them; but he would take their opinion on the fact,-had or had not, in their opinion, the plaintiff agreed to sign upon the conditionthat a particular creditor signed? That particular creditor had signed, but, as they had heard, the plaintiff still declined. The jury gave a verdict for the defendant. MIr. Baron I,RTIN then gave the rlaintiffleave to move to enter the verdict, on the ground tiat there was no evidence in law to go to the jury.
ADMRALTY COUP.T, TUISDAY. FEEL 14. TUE flUMVRTI-CflT. .TT'ZT4n iBHrf r- ID T T,-n I This was sit promoted by the Danish schooner Christina and miria, o the burden of 127 tons, against the bark Dunifries, of the burden of 318 tons, to recover for a total loss occasioned by a collision between thems at 11 p.m. oz the 5th of November last, ioff Whitby. The schooner in ballast was bound. from Haimburg to Newcastle-on-yrye; the bark was proceeding from the river Tyne to New York with a general cargo. A ccordingtotheplea of the schooner, a stiffbreeze was blovwing from the south-west; she carried a light burning brightly from the end of her bowsprit, which was visible ully three quarters of a mile off, although the atmosphere was so dark and thick that a vemsel without a light could not be seen at a grcater distance than two cables' length. She suddenly discovered the bark at the latter distance, a little on her port bow, and immed3iately ported her helm, and fell off until her sails shook. T5e bark, without making the slightest alteration in her course, ran right into the schooner, and cut her down to within a plank of the watees edge, in consequence of which she ultimately sank. She attnbuted the collision to the want of a good lookout on board the bark and toher not exhibiting ag ht. The bark, in her defence alleged that she was close hauled on the starboard tack, and that she descried the schooner two or three points on her weather bow. A patent globe lantern was instantly held up by one of the crew on his head. The schooner attempted to cross the hawse of the bark, whereupon the pilot on board ordered the helm to be hove bard aport, and hailed the schooner; but before the bark could come up into the wind the schooner, continuing her course, caught her and broke her jibboom, and chd her other damage. Sheattributedthe accident tothe want of good seamanship on the part of the schooner in not keeping her to windward of the bark Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss were heard for the schooner Dr. Bayford and Dr. Deanefor the bark Tha learned JUnDGo said; the Elder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, were of opinion that the bark was solely and entirely to blame for not having ported her helm at a much earlier period. T CH"AGR-SALVkAGE. This was an action brought by several Dilots and mariners forming the crew of the pilot boat Abeona against the fishing smack Change, to obtain remuneration for salvage services rendered toher off Lowestoft on the 3d of November last. A brig mau foal of the smack, which was riding in the Roads, the wind at the time blowing a heavy gale from S.E. by S., which caused a terrific range of sea into the harbourand along the beach. The salvors, as they repre- sented, were apprehensive that the vessels wouldfounder . or be driven on shore, and with great difficulty and risk of life proceeded to their assistance. Before they could zeach them the vessels had separated, and on boarding the smack they found that the crew had left her, and that she was considerably damag,ed. The master and part of the crew shortly afterwards returned, and the smack with much difficulty was got into the harbour. The owners did not deny that a salvage service had been rendered, but contended that the action bad been entered at a sumn greatly exceeding its value-namely, 2501. Dr. Jenner appeared for the salvors; Dr. Addauns ana Dr. Twiss for the owner The learned JuuDGE considered that it was a case that ought to have been determined before two magistrates. He awarded 50t. for the service, but without costs.

RAII WAY IfQELLIGB.WE. LONDON AND SOIJnWESTERN. !ie4-alf-yearly ineeting of this company was held yesterlay at the Waterloo-sttio; llr. J.WV. Chaplin, 3MP., m thechair. he reuport of thedireetors, an abstract of which has ppeared Dl The Tires, nas taken as read. Ihe CAI usin, in aoving the adoption of the report, called attention to tie increase of traffic on the line. During the past hal' f-year the gross receipts on the line had shown ,n iacrewe of 57,4SO overthose of the correspondi,ng period of 1854; awd tin working expenses had only increased by 12,5731. T'he wnrking expenses for the half-year included a consider_abl outlay on the permanent wPay on the Dorchester and Portsmouth lines, amounting to 9,4261.; they had also provided two additional engines out of revenue, and there were two engines on the stocks. For the additienal charge of 12,9731. they had run 59,063 additional wRes. They bad also placed 5,0001. to the reserve fand, for the renewal of the steamboats, instead of %5001. as originally proposed. l'hey did so because the latter was the best haLf-year of the tw,o. Therewassun of 106,0001. expended on the line between Andover and Salisbury, which was tnproductive, and interest had been charged to revenue en that amount. The practice with other companies w-as to charge the interest durng constructionto capitaL These and ether matters would show thsattheir interests wvere properly attended to. The' North and South WeAtern Junction was the only guarantee they had,and that would pay a dividend at the rate of 51 per cent. per annum for the past half-year beyond all liabflities from that company to contribute a certain amount ; and at the same time he had the gratification to state that 62,064 tons of coals were conveyed to their station at Breoitford from the North and South Western Junction line. The coals rwere circulated over the South-Western system as far as Dorchester, a distance of 140 miles from London, and had of course increased the traffic. Among the resolntions he had to submit there was one for votinig two sums to be carried from the suspense account to the capital account, one amounting to 23,69211 for additional plant, and another to 20,2491. for new works and Sidings durng the year 1855. They had experienced considerableanxiety both on the part of shareholders and directors to close the capital account. In lS50 the conipany suffered considerable pressure from the construction of various branches which had not conic into full operation, and a committee was appointed to ascertain the condition of the comnanv. the state of the plant, and the sum requisite to make it efficient. They soon exhausted their estimates, and they resorted to the expedient of paying for the plant out of reveLue. During four half-years they had charged 2>,0001. to revenue, but such was the growth of their traffic and the necessity for' extended sidings and additional accommodation, that they were obliged to abandon the system of paying everytb;n' out of revenue. They never had renewal funds or aepreciation funds, but adopted the honest course of keeping up the stock in efficient order as they they went aloig. A question arose as to what wasthe proper proportion of working stock for a line, and after various inquiries it was ascertained that the nearest approximation to the amount would be the year's revenue; that was, whatever the amount of the gross revenue was for the year, that was about the sum to expend on the working stock: and to show that they had not expended the full amlout on their stock, he would read a statement on the subject -In 1850 they had expended 541,3S5l. on their working stock, and the traffic receiptsamounted to 559,1031.; in 1851 to 554,4561., and the traffic to 656,420!. ; in 1152, to 570,1601., and the traffic to 611,241L.; in 1853, 570,1G0!., and the tr-affic to 689,2431.; in 1854, 618,1921., andthe traffic to 723,828l.; and in 1855, the outlay on the working stock amounted to C66,9721., and the traffic receipts to 817,7011. That. would show they bad not expended the full amount required for their stock He had told the proprietors 12 months ago that they could not charge anything to capital for additional sidings, planit, and station accomunodation, until thev had first had the vote of the proprietors. For the half-year ending last July they had made no charge, but they now ubmitted the outlay for their sanction. This was s:milar to the course recommended by a very highly intellectual committee of consultation lately appointed by the proprietors of the London and N orth-Western Company. He had ascertained that the increase of traffic on the line in consequence of the war wa s very smalL They had had about 12,000. from warbl-e passengers, and about 8,600!. for other traffic to the camp at Aldershott. The trade to Portsmouth and Southampton had been injuriously affected by the war in consequence of the Goverumenit requiring thu mail steamers for transports. At the same time the price of building and other materials was increased, wlich checked building in the suburban districts, and the traffic on 19 of the smaller stations on the line had decreased. He believed, on the whole, that peace would give them a larger traffic than they could attain during war. Their dividend .amounted to 5 per cent. for the year, leaving a balance over of 11,0001. He beieved they were in a better condition than any of the other metropolitan lines, and all that was required to insure success was unanimity among the shareholders and good conduct at their meetings, avoiding dissensions and treating the board with respect.. (Hear, hear.) Mr. EAGLEFIELD wished to know whether it was intended to char"e against revenue the interest on the 1,000,000!. whichk Parliament had authorized them to raise for the Exeter extension line? As the chairman had taken credit for charging the interest on the 106,000L to revenue, he wished to knowv whether tbe samne course wouLld be pursued with regard to the extension to Exeter ? The CasAarui- said, it had been the practice of many railway coinpanies to charge interest to capital during construction. Z. IUzrxrar said of course, the mode of charging the interest would be specified in the bill, and that would be determined by Pariiament. The Solicitor thought they had better not discuss that matter at present. Mr. HLRAPAmTU thought the chairman had made a mistake with respect to the resolutions recommended by the London and North-Western Committee of Consultation. What theyproposed was, that no expenditure of capital should be incurred, without first obtaining the consenit of the shareholders. (lHear, hear.) In the South-Western Company, the directors had expended the money without the permission of the shareholders, then placed it to a suspense account, and afterwards asked them to confirm the outlay. That was a very different matter. The words were " that no addition whatever be made to the capital expenditure of the company, without its being previously ranctioned by a vote or a general meeting;" so that they should not incur aniy expenditure without having first obtained the sanction of a general meeting. The Css,xssunss said, theyd d thesame thing, theyplaced the oxpense to a susp3ense account, and did not charge it to capital wvithout the consent of the shareholders. Mrr. HE.I,tAS-ATH di'd not takse that viewv of it. Mlr. WOOD asked anuniber of questions with regard to items in the accouints, which were explained by the auditors and 31r. Uzicii. Mr. PuxesEr. thought it right to state that he had spent several hours the day before in examining the accounts of the companv, and ho had never seen accounts so nicely prepared, and ibe had every reason to believe them accuriats. Their affairs were certainly in a souiid and prosperous position. Mr. HELPS thought the agitation they had had was very beneficial to the company. The dividends had increaselI every half-year in consequence. fA VorcR-"1 Yes, in spite of it."] He had lately been looking over some evidence relating to the Eastern Counties Company, in which it 'was stated that a coal-dealer had had exclusive rates on the South-Western line until Mr. Mortimer came on the board, but that the dealer had since done n large business at rates charged.to other parties. They were therefore very much obliged to Mr. Mortimer for that large business at high rates. He complained of the enormous fees che arlmcn agents and for shorthand notes that were not required. As they bad a bill now before Parliament, he thought they should introdue some clauses in it which should efine the 'ousiness to be done at the special and half-yearly meetings of the company. I MIr. GAtss.sL suggested that 30 days' notice reqaired to be given by a candidate for a seat at the board be abolshed. Ho also adverted to the praetice of giving free passes on the line, wlhich he believed was very injurious to their revenue, There wasan interchange of passes with the officers of other companies, and lie thought it would be a good thing to break down the system. altogether. He would call upon the secretary for an explanation. Mr. Mr10r.TDn said, it might be a very delicate matter to meddle with the passes, for in developing the traffic at Southam.pton it was found necessary to afford facilities to certain officials to carry on the btusiness there, and he believed every care was taken that none but the right party should have them. The Secretary explained that there were fewer passes granted on their line than on any other. Every pass was returned to the Traffic Committee- the reason for granting them in every case was given; and he might say the number issued was considerably reduced mince he came into office. There were only five old directors who enjoyed a free pass, and these were granted in consideration of long servces. With regardtothe directors of othercompanies it was a question of policy, as it enabled them to see how the traffic was carried on, and to suggest improvements ; they were used but seldom. They exchanged passes with the Brighton and South-Eastern Companies and with no other companies. The general passes depended on matters of business - for instance, their detective officers could travel dowvn to diburgh by means of passes over other lines, and detectives belonging to other lines could pass over their line, and tlhus robbenes or frauds might be diseovered or detected. The use of passes had tended to facilitate business on the railways, and was much restricted. On some occasions freepasses were granted to first-rate reporters to attend public meetings or trials, with a view of obtaining correct reports of the proceedings, and not to depend upon accountsdrawn up bysolicitoes clerks,whose accountsmight eincoret or erroneous. Even in this way the interests of the company were protected from erroneous statements tat mi"h be otherwise circulated by incompetent parties. The §olicitor remarked that he paid 25!. a-year for his ticket on the line, and that he derived no advantage whate ver from free passes.D Mr. Serjiaut GASELiE smid, he was on the traffic committee, and could assure them that the passes were very carefully looked into. It was a small matter for a direco to have a pass over the line, when it was considered that he Was not aowed for his services mnore than sufficient to pay ;the cabhire to and from the office. Aftersome observations from Mr. Trrs, ILP., Mr. ADIr; sc,andM,lr.3LtenIoTT,thereportwasurl3nimosyadopted a ei;7idend at the rate of 5!. 12s 'd. per cent, per annum for the half-year was declared, and the directors were authoz-zed to place two sums of 23,692!L and 20,249!. to capitalencount in accordance with the recommendation of the repe. Mr. Serjeant Gaselee and Mir. }:. J. lHuteoins, hi.?., the retiring diretors, were unanimousily re-elected, sad LsoA[tr,Eoycs, the retiring auditor.

Ar. Sejeant GAsLEE proposed, " That the qualification of directors of the company be, in future, the holding of 2,C000. instead of 1,0001. stock in thc company." Mr. Ssow p reposed, as an amendments "That the eualification be 3,0oi0. ;" which was seconded by Mr. PVNCiin, and carried unanimously. It was also agreed that the qualification should be held 12 months by a candidate before his election to a seat at tLe board. Oii the motion of Mr. Serjeant GAsELEE it was agreed that the proprietors should have powerto remove a director by a mnajonty of two-thirds of those present at a special meeting convened for the purpose. Clauses would be inserted in the bill now before P'arliament, embodying the foregoing resolution. Mr. WoOD then brouglht forward his motion for removing the banking account of the company to the Bank of Eng- -n1d r. UJ ZIELTiT satisfactorily explained the practical diticulties and inconveniences that would arise to the company from such a course, and clearly showed the advantages and security the company now possessed in dealing with their present bankers. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the p:oceedings. LONDON AND BICKWALTL The report of the directors of tlis company states that the net revenue, with the balance of 1141. from the previous account, amonnts to 23,8961., and that, after deducting the interest on eebentures, there remains 19,3331. available for dividend. From this sunm the directors recommend that a dividend of 3s. 6d. per share be declared, which will leave 2351. to le carried to the credit of the current half-year.

You know that I always disliked the influence of the foreiga reformers upon ours, but that was passing. I could not use such an expression as 'the prindp i any, of the English Reformation" nor should 1 everhavefadmitted it into any work for which I was responsible for I have always believed that the Enlish Reormaaton had very definite principles, and what I have wished to doe(as far as iname lay) was to bring people back to the principles of the English Reformation, as expressed inthePrayer Book and Homilies. Iam .not conscious of having done one thing beyond the principles of the English Reformation. The ReFormers acknowledged the Hfoly Scriptures as the sole rule of faith 2 they acknowledged the early ages of the Gospel its best interpreter; ecumenical councils as authoritative; they bcEevea in the Sacrament of baptism, the real presence of the bodyand bloodof Christin the Holy Eucharist; they provided a form of absolution for penitents who specially confessed their sins; they believed in the value of good works done through the grace of Christ and by his Spilt; they believed that he would come again at the end of the world to judge both the quick and the dead, according to their works; they gave directions as to days and seasons of fasting; they taught the value of almsgiving, of daily public prayer, of frequent conumunions, and so on. I believe that those whom people call Tractarians have, in the main, been trae to the principles of the English Reformation; and I must beleve that those who taunt us wvith not being trae to those principles, themselves only take as much of them as they like. God is the judge. v wish those who jucde us would only exercise as much charity, and take as much pains to know what we realy believe, and look to anything which they would thihik good in our teaching if they knew it, as they would in case of Dissenters. There would soon be more peace and a better understanding. -Yours affectionately, E. B. PusEY, Christ Church, Oxford, Feb. 12." TiE SocEry oF ARTs.-MTi. R.

27cc GREAT NORTHERN and NORTH-WESTERN RAIL WA VS. TO TH EDITO OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I shall feel obliged by your allowing the accompanying letter to Lord Chandos to appear in your paper to-morrow, if not very inconvenient. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. EDMD. D)ENISON1 Great Northern Eailway, King's-cross, Feb. 14. "KRing's-cross, London, Feb. 14. "My Lord and Gentlemen,-Yo have published a letter by way of answer to my statement in 27c Times last Tuesday, in which you begin by saying that it is incorrect, and end with a conspicuous postscript, of which the plain object is to drive me either into charging Mr. Seymour Clarke with direct falsehood or into retracting what I said before. I duly appreciate the device, and shall deal with it as it deserves. "The point-and the only one in my letter-which you 'distinctly and positively contradict' is that you 'Iknow and have known all along that the Great Northern manager had no authority from his board to enter upon such a negotiation'-i. e., a negotiation on the principle of excluding this company from aU share of the western traffic while you compote with us for the eastern and northern, 'and still less toassentto any conditions on which the negotiation should proceed.' By eay of proving your coatradictioct you quote a letter from Mr. Clarke to Captain Huish of the 10th of August Last, aying that 'he had the authority of his chairman to meet for the discussion of aplan for the eatension of the arrangement,' and, further, that 'he had discussed With me the policy of extending the arradigement to the MIanchester, Sheffleld, and lhncoinshire district, to which he adds that I saw no objection.' "bIf you think that letter of any service to your cause, it is a pity that you did not think it worth while to quote the neat and concluding paragraph of it:-' It is of course understood thuat any scheme for the divfision of traffic at which we may arrive is to be subject to the approval of our boards.' And yet you now Put forw.ard that letter a s proving that because tinis heard did not ratify his consent to your manager's proposals they are to be treated as persons who employ an agent to make agreements for them, and then repudiate sac agreements. "But, further, thatlettera]one is sufficient toprovethat tho board never intended their manager to enter upon any such question as that which you profess to consider concluded by the miniutes of the four managers. "The letter itself tells you that the objeet was to 'extend thearrangement,' commonlyeaUciledthe 'Ten Town' Arrangement,' made by Mr. Gladstone's award, for a longer period and to other places, especialy places in the Mamchester company's district. You represent him as having had authority thereby given to consent to exclude this company from the Manchester district altogether. So that that part of the letter which you have not quoted proves that hehad no authority at all to conclude the board by anything he mighlt do, and that you knew he had not; and the part which you have quoted proves that the matter which he was authorized to discuss was extension of our powers to the Manchester district, and not the absolute exclusion from it, w,-hich you insist on as a preliminary condition to all other negotiation. " You knogw, moreover, that the deputations from this board have told you from firstto lastthat their manager had no authority to consent to anythaing of the kind, and that the beard wsould not consent to it. But you put forward another letter of Mr- Clarke's of the 30th of January written not before, but after you had refused four of the offers which I stated in my letter to 7Tc Times, and after you had given us notice that you should reduce the fares from a given day, for the purpose of proving we had then changed our minds, and were prepared to submit to the conditions whlich we had throughout refused. I shall be glad to understand what you or anybody else profess to find izi that letter, or the memorandum referred to, wvhich expresses onr assent to be excluded from the Manchester distiict, or from receiving any traffic that may be brought to us from tbe west. " But as soon as the deputations met on the 7th of February .1 found that the letter was understood or interpreted by you in a seise wvhich I naver intended it to bear, when I consented to Mr. Clarke wvriting it, as he did at midnight from York (on paper wvith the date ' ing'-cross' printed on it) long after the board had broken up; and I therefore said at onlC, when I muet you on the 7th, that I could not recognize the letter as the act of the board, or consent to bind this company to agreements in the dark. " What I intended was to allow these points to form subjects for discussion and negotiation, wvhereas I found they were insisted upon by you as a preliminary to all discussion or negotiation. " ' The memorandum referred to,' which you publish as if it was a 3memorandmn agreed to by the four managers, was no such thing, but simnply a memorandum made by Mr. Seymour Clarke of a conversation between himself and Mr. Watldn which had taken place in the train that day. It is absurd to suppose that such a document as that was ever intended to be deliberatelyaceepted by any board as a condition precedent to all negotiation, which you attempt to make It. " I beg to add that I had sent a copy of that letter myself, together with the minutes of the discussion upon it at the next meeting of the deputations, to the Editor of Thte Tisitcs, in order that he might judge for himtself how far my statement was bornle out or contradicted by it, as the statement was sent by way of correction of a paragraph in Tlie Tiesea itself. " You do not deny, or attenipt to deny, the most important part of my statement as regards the public-viz. that your insisting on excluding us from Manchester and the west las been and is the reason for your refusal to accept any of oiur proposals for peace and for reducing the fares, in distinct violation, not of any unauthorized managers' minute; but of a solemn agreement, sealed and delivered by no less than seven companies, relating to tle Scotch and English traffic. I havethe honour to be, my Lord and Gentlemen, your obedient huniblo sen-ant, "EDMD. DENISON. "The Marquis of Chandos, MP., Mr. John Ellis, and Mr. John Chapman."
POSTAL COMMUNICATION TWITH THE A USTAA- LIAN COLONIES. The copy of a Treasury minute, dated the 27th of November, 1855, upon tle subject of postal communicationbetween England and the Australian colonies, was issued yesterday. The minute enters into a variety of details relative to the communications which have passed with the Colonial-office, the colonies, the Postmaster-GeiLeral, &c. The concluding portion of the minute shows the result. The plan which "my Lords" propose is thus shortly summed up:- "1. That they shall instruct the Admiralty to obtain tenders, by open competition, for a monthly postal service between this country and Australia, the vessels (outward and homeward) touching at King George's Sound, Melbourne, and Sydney, carrying the mails for the six colonies of New South lVales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and NSew Zealand. "2. That branch services shall be established by open competition from Melbourne, as the central point, with Port Adelaide, Van Diemen's Land, and New Zealand. " 3. That all letters and newspapers shall be prepaid, and that each post-office shall retain its owvn receipts. " 4. That the entire cost of the services described shall be divided equally betiween the home Government and the colonies collectively. " 5. That each of the colonies shallcontributetothomoiety to be paid by them collectively in proportion to the number of letters despatched by each, to be ascertained every two years. "In the first place it will be necessary to obtain from each of the. colonies named a duly authorized legislative acquiescence in the arrangement proposed. Por this purpose let a copy of this miuute be transmitted to the Colonial-office, and request that the Secretary of State wil take the necessary steps with that viewv; but state that, as some time must elapse before replies can be received from the different colonies, and as my Lords are anxous that no time should be lost in re-establishing a monthly mail by steam, my Lords, relying upon the correspondence now before them from the Governors of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, have decided to take immediate steps in order to secutre a comlmencement of the service at theearliestpossible time afterthereceipt of communications from the different colonies acquiescing in the proposed arrangements. "Write to the Secretary of the Admiralty and request that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty will take immediate steps to procure tenders for a monthly postal communication by steam w ith Australia on the following conditions, and report to this board before any contract is actuallymade "1. Thetenders to be delivered within two months of the date of the advertisement. "2.

THE LOSS OF TRE JOSEPHIVE WLS, S. Yestexday morning, at 11 o'clockl a public official inquiry was instituted into the circumstances attending the disastrous loss of the emigrant ship Josephine Willis, by a colision with the Mangerton steamer, off Folkestone, on the night of the 3d inst., before Mr. Yardley, magistrate of the Thames Police-court, and Captain Robertson, R.N., representing the Board of Trade, at the Town-hall, Poplar, under a provsion of the Merchant Shi ping Act. Mr. Ballantine appeared as counsef or the London and Iamerick Steamn (omplay (the owners of the Mangerton steamer), instructed byhr. HT. O'Shea, the enmpany's solicitor ; Lr. Parry, barrister represented the propnetors of the Josephine Willis, with ir.WVinckworth, their solicitor; and ~Mr. O'Dowd, barrister, was in attendance to assist at the inquiry onbehalf of theBoardof Trade, as wasalsoMr. Hame1, solicitor to the Customs. A prelminary discussion arose, at the instance of Mdr. Yardley, as to the right of counsel to be present and to be heard at an inquizy winch, in his opinion, wvas more in the nature of a prelimsinary than a judicial investigation ; and, bir. Balantine and Mr. Parry having been heard in defence of their right to conduct the case of their respective clients, the Court decided that, though there were, in point of fact, no persons before it whom it could at present recognize, counsel might remain and assist in the investigation but not as representing any particular persons whom the Court could recognize. To render some parts of the evidence intelligible, it sholda be premised that on the night of the collision the Mangerton steamer exhibited three lights, in conformity with the act of Parliament-namely, a bnrght light on the foremast, about 50 feet above the level of tZe sea; a red light on the paddlebox on the port side of the vessel; and a green light on the paddlebox on the starboard side. The Josephine Villis, on the other hand, carried a lantern on her bowsprit with three panes in it, the one in front showing a bri ht white lght, and the two others a red and green light. Captain Robertson contends that it was in contravention of the statute for the Josephine Willis, she being a saiing vessel, to exhIbit a light of that triple character, and that she ought only to have shown a single bright light. The rule of the road, as it is. called, on the high seas, which has an important bearing on theinqui is thus defned in the 29Cth section of the Merchant Shipping Act :-" Whenever any ship, whether a steam or sailig shiip, proceeding in one direction meets another ship, whether a steam or sailing ship, proceeding in another direction, so that if both ships were to continue their respective courses they would pass so near as to involve any risk of a colision, the helms of both ships shall be put to port, so as to pass on the port side of each other; and this rule shall be obeyed byall steam ships and by all sailing ships, whether on the port or starboard tack, and whether close hauled or not, unless the circumstances of the case are such as to render a departure from the rule necessary in order to avoid immediate danger, and subject also to the proviso that due regard shall be had to the dangers of navigation, and, as regards sailing ships on the starboard tack close hauled, to the keeping such ships under command." Lr. Kester Clayton was the first witness caled. lie said, in answerto qcuestions byMr. YARDIEY,-I was chief officer of the Josephine Willis, a passenger-ship of 786 tons burden, bounad from London to Auckland, New Zealand. She left London on Saturday morning, the 2dof February, and passed through the Downs and by the South Foreland, the latter at 6 p.m. on Sunday, the 3sL The crewv, 40 in number, consisted of a captain, three officers, an assistant-surgeon, and ablebodied seamen and apprentices. There were alsoabout 65 passengers on boar. The ship was in all respects in an efficient state when she left London. When we passed the South Foreland the wind was south-east. The atmosphere was beautifaully clear overhead, buthazy on the water and the horizon. My watch was from 6 to B o'clock that evening. The accident happened a little after 8 o'clock, and vihen I had charge of the ship. I was on thepoop at the time. A man named Grindle had charge of the wheeL About 7 o'clock the wind changed to the S.S.E. We thenbraced the yards nearly "sharp," and hanled the bowlines. At the time of the accident the atmosphere was still clear overhead. There was no moon, but it was starlight. It was hazy on the sea and, on the horizon. The haze rose to the topuist head, or about half-mast high. We were not then, in eonsequence of the mist, carrying all the sail which the state of the wind might have justilied. At the time of the accident we were sailing at the rate of seven knots an hoar, steering W.S.W., which was the proper Cbannel course, with the wind as it was, to clear Dungeness. At 10 minutes to S Folkestone bore north by west, and we were about four miles and a-half from that place. I think eight bells had struck when the look-out man on the forecastle called out" Light ahead, on the starboard bow withaL" That immediately drew my attention in that direction. I was then on the port aide of the poop, and ran forward to the forecastle, Isaw the lght on the starboard bow. It Was a bright light, but not very visible, and I could not see wvhether it was in motion. I ran afterwads to the poop, and, supposing it to be Dungeness Light, starboarded the helm. Tlhe ship then came to, about a poit to the wind, and I steadied my helm. I then went to the leo side of the poop, and looked at the light, under the foot of the mainsaiL Presentl, after a time, but I don't know how long, I saw the red light, more than four points on the starboard bow. linmediatelyafterthat I saw thegreenlight. I knew then it was a steamer's light, and I made no alteration in my course, for I was sure we should go clear of each other if we kept our respective courses. I still remnained on the poop, and the only direction I gave to the helnsman was "' Steady." The red light was shut out by that time. About a minute or so after that, but I cannbt state the time exactly, the green light vanished, and I called to the hehusman to put the helm hard a-starboard. Tha effect was to bring the ship a little round. I saw that a collision was inevitable, and it took place immediately afterwards. The steamer came nearly stem on to us, with her head incliued a little forward, and struck us just before the main riggina, on the starboard side. About a minute before the cogision the captain of the Josaphine Willis came on deck and repeated my order to keep the helm hard a-starboard. When the steamer struck us she backed away. After the collision, and not before, the steamer reversed her engines. I saw that by the back water coming up the ship's side. She backed astern, and then went on ahead for about half a mile. I reported to the captain that the ship was rapidly filling with -water through the bi-each in her side made by the steamer, and he ordered the boats to be lowered. The two quarter-boats were then lowered, and one of them was stove in vhile being lowered by passengers. I returned to the poop with Wr. Mohan, the third mnate, where I found the captain pulling his coat off. le directed me to throw thehencoops overboard, which I did, so far as I was able. Tho passengers and crew were then mostly on the poop, but I could not in the confusion distinguish passenters from crew. I noticed a man and his w ifqe in their night drestes on the poop. The captain ealled out for all persons below to came on to the poop, but I cannot say whether any effort was made to get them up, except canemg out. About the same time or a ithtle fter the captain ordered the quarter boats to be lofered he ordered the n ifeboat to be lpweereab I ent to endeavour to get the longboat ready, but I foundthe water on the quarter-decklkneedeep. I returned to the poop, and the ship heeled over and I went overboard. By chance I got hold of a rope-end, and hauled myself into the riggig of the mizentop. The ship was then lymg on her beam ends in the water. There Nwere four or five others in the rigging besides myself, one of whom was the carpenter, .nd several of the passengers and crew on the deck were calling out for assistance to the steamer, hut she did not return. The steamer's boat at length came with two passeugersinier,Tutwithnone ofthesteamer'screw, andtook myself and the others off the rigging, and conveyed us to the steamer, about half amile distant. Before being taken into the boat I was so benumbed that I fell into the water, and I was hauled into the boat by the carpenter. The steamer was then lying to with no sails set, and iithout her machinery in emotion, and the crew were enngaed in removing the cargo from the fore part of the ship. I went to the captai of the steamer, and asked him if he was going back to the hip; he rephled that helmad to remove the carol Ifrom thsefore p art of his vessel. Iwas then illand benumbed with cold, and went down below to warm myself. After an hoir or two I retuned on deck and assisted in removing the argo. When I was dowIn warmingmyself the machinery of the steamer was not PUt in motion at all, and on my retunin on deckshe was Iying in much the same position, except that she had drifted a lite. No effort, that I know, was made on the part of the steamer to return to the ship; but she let off rockets and blue lights. The steamer eventualy returned to wiamsgnto harbour. Wehad finished removing the cargo beforethe machinery ;was set in motion to return to Ramisgate. By Captain ROnssmiSOn;.-Whenlsaw the green3ight, the red lght, and the bright lght at the same time, I did not alter my helmn. When I lost the green light, an,d saw only the bright light and the red light, the head of the steamer was then coming directly towards us. By my losing sight of£the green light I3knew the steamer must hive ported her helm. I never nltered my helm until I saw the co33ision was inevitable, considering if the steamer kept in the course she was then going wy e should steer clear. When I saw the three hghts I knew there was no risk of a collision: and if I had then ported my helm I should have run right into her. When the captain came on deck he could do nothing to avert the collision. I consider my evidence as to what took place on board of the steamer after Igot there as worth nothing, as Iwas then in a state almost insensible for a time. We had on board the Josephine W*illis, fixed on the bowvsprit, one lamp, showing three different coloured lights. I have acertificate of ompetency from the Trinty Board. I consider the light carried by the Josephine WlVlis to be a ppero one. I don't, know that the act of Parliament says that no vesael except a steamer should carry a bright light, a red light, and a green li'ht. WVhen I passed the Trinity Board the present rules of?the road w ere not in exitence. By 3r.Ballantine.-The changing the course of the vessel was done under an error on my parb in mistaking the steamer's light for that of Dungeness. At Folkestone I stated on the inquest I was, perhaps, not sufficiently wellacquainted with Channel navigation, but I said so in the confusion of the moment, when Mr. Town, a local attorney; was cross-exanlin6ig and sneering at me. The fact is quite otherwise, for I had previously undergone an examination, and received a certificate of competency as a Channel pilot. By Mr. Parry.-The light of the steamer, which I mistook for Dungeness light, was a bright light, and Jungcness light is alsona right light. AVhen I first saw the bright light the Josephine Wilis could not be said to be on either bow of the steamer. The helm of the steamer must have been ported to shut out the green light from me. It is my firm opinion that if the steamer had kept on her COUrse, and had net ported her helm, she must have cleared the Josephine Wllis bybout half- a- ship's length. The Josephine Wfillis~was nearly cut right in two by the steamer. She was struck right in the hospital parltof the shinp,whera fortuatbely there were no invalids at. the time, or they must have been killed in the collision. By Mr. ODowd.-I had a certificate of service from the Board of Trade, but probably it was not a certificate of competency. ByMr. YAIsnrars----lhave served as chief mate five or sin years nest June. I have been 1f or 17 years at sea, and about U1 or 12 years an officer. Mr. Henry Grey R-ay, eamncmed by Mr. YAnnas, sad. -wi.ia: pli^Qngej WIIJ so w~ife and brother, on a s the Jomephine Willis.

After that } saw azed light. The order ws then given to luf and thixmnate ran forward. I then saw a green light, and thec order wasgivento luffagain. I afterwards lost s-fittof the green light. I think the mate had gone forwl ard eorot we lost sight of the green light, but I am not sure. AfterI lost sight of the green ight I saw all three lights 4!ain and the green light was in stght until junt a few seconds be fore the steamer struck us. 1heardnoordergiventothemq at the helm afterthe matewent forward. The steamer tool_ a sweep just before the collision and came right into thaJosephine WIllis, as if she (the steamer) had ported herhelm. Immediately afterthe coDision Iheard the captaim give an order to lower the boats. Isaw several persons. lowvering one of the quarter-boats, which was store in in the, process ona projecting crane. Ihzdpreviouslypuntmywifa. and another woman into the boat. The doctor, a man named Smitb, the second mate, myself, and tvo others weraalso in the boat. The boat at length got clear of the ship. and on reaching the water a coat was put into the Lol which kept her fromn sinking. After putting off from thoship we came up with the lifeboat of the Josephine VWls, in which were about 20 persons, but I could not say whothey were, and I put my wife and the other'woman ito her. On getting on board the Idangerton I sawv the boatswain of the Josephine W;llis,: and I volunteered to retarn with him to the wreck: in the lifeboat, to afford assistance to any of the passengers. who might be alive and floating about; but he refu togo, alleging as a reason that in the state the steamer them. was she might go down, and if he did not keep the lifeboatnear her, the persons who had already been saved might go. down with her. That gave me a notion of the dangerouscondition of the Mangerton, and I did not further urge theboatswain to go to the wreck, nor did I go myself with anyone else. The captain of the steamer saidhe mnst removothe cargofrom the forepart of the vessel, toinsurebersafety and all on board, beforehe could go tothe assistanceof the Josephine Willis. The whole of the crew of thesteamer were then engaged in the removal of the cargo.. Before the safety of the steamer was ascertained a boat wassent from her to the reliefofthe ship, andshe returnedabouti half-past 9, bringing Clayton and several others; but fourof the crew of the Josephine Willis, who had got on boarJ. the steamer, had previous to that time refased to go on that . errand when it was proposed to them. A little after 10those men and others left the steamer in the lifeboat of theJosephine Willis, with the intention, as we thought, of goingto the assistance of any one who might be floating about the - scene of the wreck; hut I did not see anything of themafterwards. I believe thev landed at Deal Deal lugger was also hailed by the captain of the mangerton, and sent out to the assistance of the Josephine Willis. That lugger would have carried 50 or 60 perssns, and the lifeboat from 20 to 30. I think some Rortion of the crew and some of the boats of the steamer might havabeen spared to go to the succour of the Josephine Willis.- The sea was calm, and I saw nothing to prevent them. We - beard a great cry of distress from a nlumber of persons on. the Josephbine Willis just as the Deal lugger came alongsidethe steamer, and she and the lifeboat went awFay to theirrelief. It did not occur to me at 10 o'clock, when thesteamer was ascertained to be safe, to despatch some of theboats of the steamer to the assistance of the crewand passengers of the ship, because I thought the lagger and the lifeboat wvhich had gone away on that errand were amply sufficient. There would have been no danger whatever ira going away in the boats of the steamer in search of any of' the crew and passengers who might be floatimg about orL spars or any part of the wreak. It was safer to be in theboats than on board the steamer herself. By CaptainRomucrsoi;.-Thesteamerremaineda'oonttwohours and a-half in the vicinity of the collision before proceeding on her course agai. If Hwehad ported our helm om board the Josephine Willis when we saw the red and thebright light there could be no doubt we should have steered. clear of each other. The rnle of the road is when two shipsare aproaching each other forboth to prt helm. By r. Ballantine.-Whenwe on board the Josephin*Wiissawthe red light andthebright lightour coursewouldit havebeentoportowrhelm I did not think- thesteamnerwas safe evsn at 10 o'clock, two hours after the collision. B Mr. Parry.-My impression was that the steamer wold have cleared us by 30 or 40 yards until she ported her - helm, and then she ran right into us. I heardthem call out on board the stemaer, "lPort, port " and just after that she must have ported her helm, for shecame right into us. The, colion occurred almost immediately after the order toport, and I believe it was the consequence of that order. John Sheen said,-I was an able seaman in the JosephinaWillis, and on the look-out in the fore part of the ship for - some time before and at the time of the collision. When I first saw the white light I reported to the chief mate that there was alight a-head. The chief and s^cond mates then. came to me. We could not then make out any seconEt light. The first mate returned to the poop, and jut afterthat I saw a red light and white light, when we put ourhelm astarboard. We then lost sight of the red light and. caught the green light, the sight of which we never lost up - to the tine of the collision. The Mangerton came straightistem on to us. It was the circumstance of the Yanmertors porting her helm that caused the collision, considering: the course the Josephine Willis was pursuing. WbenL the captain gave -the order to lower the boats I, along -with others, proceeded to lower the lifeboat. which would hold about 25 or 28 persons. Some 19 or 20' erons got into her, and I among them, and we pushed off' om the vessel; but we did not leave the vessel until the water was nearly on to the poop. We aftervards came up with another boat, in which were Mr. Bay, his wife, another woman, and others, and we took the two women on hoard*' making the number in the lifeboat about 20, andproceededf to the MIngerton in the company of the other boat. By Captain RonsRTavO.-If the Josephe Willis bad. ported her helm, the probability is that she wouldhave ru. clearof theMangerton. By Mr. Parry.-When we got on board the steamer wCasled the captain, or, at all events, a man on the quarterdeck, whom we took to be the captain, whether he was not; gomg to return to the relief of the crew and passengerxs when he said he would do so after he got his cargo removed from the fore part of the ship, and he began cursing ant swearing at us. If the helm of the Mangerton had not.- been ported, we should have cleared each other. By Captain ROBERTS^ON.-But if we had both continued. our courses, and nothing had been done on either side to alter the course of either ship, they would very likely hava come into collision. Corroborative evidence was given by William Grindlc,. the man at the helm of the Josephine W-illis at the time oE the collision; James Smith, a seaman; and John Trill, theboatsvain's mate; and the inquiry was adjourned at halt. past 4 o'clock, until this mornmg at IL
I SIR CHALES BARY AND THETEASURY. Copies of Treasury minutes dated the 6th of February; 1854, and 26th of January, 1856, were printed yesterday in, regard to the claims of Sir Charles Barry for services con. nected with the building of the new Palace at Westminster. It appears that on the 26th of May last the following offerwas mnade to Mr. White, as acting for Sir C. Barry, with a view finallyto settle all questions as to commission, snea. surement, and all other claimis np to Ocober 2, 1853, towhich date the closed accounts exftended, Sir C. Barry, it;shonldbe said, having put in various claims for extra pay. ment over and above hs commission L That a commission of three per cent. should be allowec on the entire outlay of 1,506,845!., up to the 24 of OctoberX 1853. 2. That a remuneration for measurement upon the whole of the works included in that outlay should be paid at the rate of one per cent. 3. That these commissions should cover all demands oE e-erykind whatsoever for the pt, the services for warming, lighting, and ventilating alone excepted, which should bedealt with separately and upon their own merits. 4. That the remuneration of Sir Charles Barry for thefuture shouldbe fixed at- Three per cent, commission on the onUtay as architect; and one per cent. for measurement npon all works to wthich measurement applies; and that no furniture, &c., should irc future he furnished by Sir C. Barry except by the special order of the Treasury. After numerous further interviews and discussions vith. Mr. White, that gentleman, on the part of Sir CharlesBarry, declinedtheterms of settlement thus offered, and, pressed again the claims for the exra services performed. My L,ords having again referred Sir C. Barry's claims fora report to the Board of Work;s, and having very carefully - reviewed the whole case, continue to be of opinion that tho terms herein stated are not only fair but liberal; that they include all remuneration to which Sir C. Barryis entitled for the services he has performed; and thattheirLordships could not extend the same consistently with theibduty to the public. Considering, moreover, that this matterhas gone on for nearly 20 years without any distinct understanding bemng arrived at, notwithstanding the efforts of every successive. Board of Treasury to do so, my Lords are of opinion that it is inconsistent withthe public interests that it should be any longer delayed; and they therefore, as far as they are ooncerned, must record these terms as their final decmsion uponr the questions at issue. They are pleased, consequently, tow direct that no further payment be made on account, untilu final settlement of the past, and an agreement as to thL future, are concluded.
