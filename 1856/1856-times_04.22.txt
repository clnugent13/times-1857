1R&Y4L YISIT TO 9RE C.4Ar) AT COLCIESTER. I ----- -- _ - Yesterday his Royal Highness Prince Albert paid a visit to-the camp at Colchester, and inspected the troops ste.1oned there, under the command of Major-General Gascs*Igne. The day was singuLarly auspicious, and the neiglbouring gentry andinhabitantsgenerally for miles round ',ante in great nurn- hers to witneastue ceremony. its Itoyal Highness, who was' attended by General Gr*, Lord Alfred Paget, and Adjn i tant-Gene-:eu Sir (eotge Eetherali, started from the Shoreditch terminus of the Eastern Counties Railway at 10 o'clock in the morning by a special train, and arrived at Col=hester about half-past 11. There he was received by Major-Genernl Gascoigne and his staff, and escorted on horseback to the town-hall, where an address was to be presented to him by the corporation, a detachment of the 11th Regiment forming a guard of honour. The whole length of the road, from the station to the cetire of the town, which is remarkably picturesque, was lined with a dense crowd, anxious to see the pageant as it passed. Triumphal arches were erected at intervals along the route, banners floated froma the church steeples, public buildings, and many private houses, and a joyous peal of belLs was rung in honour of the occasion. The scene in the Highstreet, at the wvin-dows of which the £eiti of the gentry and inhabitants were assembled, was exceedingly animated, and the ovation which the Prince received there, and, indeed, 'wherever he went, must have been exceedingly gratifying to hinm. His Royal Highness wore the uniiform of a FieldMarshal, decorated with the insignia of the Bath, and rode a dark chestnut charger of great beauty. On arriving at the town-hall, to which a select party, composed mostly of ladies, had been adumitted, he was received by the Mayor, aldermen, and several of the principal burgesses, and conducted to a dais at the end of the apart. ment. Mr. C. G. Round, the Reconrer of the borough, then approached his Royal Highness, and presented to him an address of congratulation and welcome, and expressing sentiment3 of loyalty and affection to Her Majesty on behalf -of the corporation. His Royal Highness, in acknowledging this compliment, said,-" M-r. Mayor and Gentlemen, I am deeply sensible of the kindness and cordiality which have marked your reception of me on this my first visit to your ancient borough. I have embraced with the greatest satisfaction this opportunity of becoming acquainted with a part of England which I had not before seen; and it is most gratifying to me to find among the people of Colchester the same zeal for the true interests and the honour of the country, and the same loyalty and affectionate attachment to their Sovereign, that I have fould in all other parts of Her Majesty's dominions which I have visited. To be the channel for conveying to the Queen the expression of such sentiments of loyalty and patriotism is as agreeable to me as I know it will be to Her Majesty's heart to receive them." The Roval party, on leaving the town-hall, proceeded to the camp in the vicinity of the town, accompanied as before by General Gascoigne and his staff, escorted by a detachment of the West E,sex.Yeomanry as a guard of honour; and having inspected its general economy and the interior ar rangements of some of the huts, they repaired to Wavenhoe rark, the property of Mr. Guerdon Rebow, about three miles distant, where the troops had 'een sent early la the day for inspection by his Royal Highness. They consisted of the SSth Regiment, under the command of Colonel Maxwell, and four regiments of m1ilitia-namely, the West Sufolk, the West Essex, the East Norfollk, and the 1sex Rifles-making an aggregate force of about 2,000 men, and commanded respectively by Colonel Deare, Lieutenant-Colonel 3sryce, M-ajor Sir Edmund Lacon, and Major Wallace. The fine park at Wavenhoe, which was generously throwu open to the public on the occasion, without restriction, by Mr. Rebow, was singularly well adapted for a military review and the spectacle there, wvhich between 10,000 and 15,000 people assembled to witness, was exceedingly animated and p'cturesqute. The town of Colchester may be said to have been almost literally deserted. By far the greater part of the population, rich and poor, young and old, turned out to 'witness the review, and the road from the town to Wavenhoe, some four mriles in length, in the endless variety of vehicles caUed into requisition, the motley crowcd of pedestrians, the ludicrous mishaps on the way, and the dense cloud of dust in which all alike were enveloped, strongly reminded one of a Derby day. Arriving on the ground, his Royal Highness received the salute of the General in command, and the bands of the several regiments played the national anthem. The Prince, attended by his suite and by General Gascoigne and his staff, then rode along in front of the troops, which were *drawn up in line for the purpose, and closely inspected them. Observing Captain Browne, who has recently returned from the Crimea with the loss of an arm, on the right flank of the $Sth Regiment, his Royal Highness paused for a noment and desired that Captain Browvne should be presented to him, which was immediately done by General Gascoigne. His Royal Highness, so attended, took up a poe* tion near the flagstaff;and the brigade formed into open columns of companies, and msarched past in " quick time ;" then in columns, at quarter distance; and, again, in contiguous dose columns. They subsequently advanced ccc eckclon of battalions and performed several other manceunvres, finally lining for some distance the road on either sidc from the point of regress from the park. At the lrince's request the officers in command of the several regiments were presented to hin, and, having expressedto General Gascoigne the pleasure v.-hich the appearance of the troops and the wvholearrangements of the day had afforded him, he left about 2 o'clock, escorted as before. On his way to the station his Royal Hlighne.-s visited the Alum for Idiots, estaoblshed in the suburbs of the town, the inmates of wlsich hlad been asembled in the adjacent grounds to receive him, .and they cheered him or his presenting himself among them, and again on taking his departure. On arriving at the station the officers forming the staff of General (ascoigne, including Colonel Herbert, Major Raines, and Captain Bulwer; and also Colonel Earl Jermyn, of theWest Suffolk Militia; Colonel Adair, of the Artillery stationed at Ipswich; andColonelSingleton, of the llthRegi- - ment, all of whom had taken part in the proceedings of the day, wvere presented to his Royal Highness. He made some kind inquiries respecting Captain Hamilton, tlme brigademajor at the camp, who has just returned from the Crinea with four clasps and an intimation that he is to receive the decoration of the Legion of Honour from the Emperor of the French. Shortly before 3 o'clock his Royal Highness tools his departure for Bnckingham Paisce, amid the cheers of the populace. To a strong detachment of the Esse:e constabulary, unnder the command of Captain M'Hardy, the chief of the force, assisted by the borough police, is due the credit of having maintained the admirable order which characterized the whole proceedings.
Mfe MIDDLESEX MAGISTRATES aznd CORONYERS. TO TME EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You and the readers of your journal vo-lid scarcely credit, from the remarks of Mr. Kemshead at the meeting of the Middlesex magistrates on Thursday, that no inquest bad actually been held on the body of the late -Mr. W'Jhite and no post mortcm examination performed; and that, as no charge had been made to the county on account of anything in reference to the case, the matter did not properly come under the conizance of the magistrates. Such, how;ever, are facts; and some other circumstances I now proceed briefly to relate On Friday, A pril 4, betvw een 9 and 10 o'clock in the forenoon, in the absence of MIr. WaLley, the constable of St. Pancas applied to me to hold an inquest on the body of Mr. Wismte, of Upper Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square, a collector of rates for the parish, and who, the constable reported, had been found insensible in a water-closet and died soon afterwards, the cause of hiis death being unknown. Accordingly, I gave directions to the constable to summon a jury and the necessary witnesses, and to cause a surgeon to make a post rvlortens examination of tse body, and torthe convenience of the family I fixed to hold the inquest at 9 o clock on the same evening. On arriving at th:e house at the time appeointed I found that the corpse had been uncoffined, but Mr. JaLins, the surgeon in attendance, informed me that it was so much deco7mposed that he had not proceeded to make a lost mzortem examination. He further told me that MIr. White had not been found insensible, but that he had spoken rationally subsequent to his seizure, and was attended medically from that period to the time of his death, nine hours afterwvatds. Oni receiving this infornation I declined to bold any iaquest on the body, and no inquest was held. The jury were forthwith discharged from further attendance withreference to this cawe. The application having led to no inquest, I did not even make an entry of it in the day-book of the coroner, and 31r. WVakley knew nothing whatever of the matter until five days aftervards-namely, on the 9th inst., when he received a letter from the Rev. G. AV. White, brother of the deceased, w,hich letter MEr. Wfakicy banded to me to answer. Mr. Kemshead remarked to his brother magistrates that " the constable receives a fee for giving notice to the coroner, anld that the more inquests there are the greater is the constable's advantage. It is a remarkable fact, however, that the constable of St. Pancras is the only one throughout the county who is paid for his services under the direction of the coroner by a fixed salary, and not by fees. It is therefore a matter of indifference to him hor nmnny or how few inquests taLe place. except that the greater the number of inquests the greater must be his labour and anxiety. In the ease in question he could gain nothing, whether the inquest was held or whether it was declied. The constable of St. Pancras is a most able, intelligent, and meritorious officer; and being, as he is, the sole sunsrioring constable whose duty it is to act under the coroner lanthe 3nost extenlsive pariah in the metropolis, he must work night and day to perform so efficiently as he does the great lawour which the numerous insquests in that parish entail uponhinm. I cannot believe that wiith reference to the death of Zr. Whhite he "has since stated that he gave the information to Mfr. WaLley hnmself, and that Mr. WZakley issued the waurrant " for the constabWe of St. Paneras know-s wel} that he made the application to mvself iD the absence of Mr. Walicey, and that, as the depty of St.M Waldey, I gave all the directions which I then deemed requste.

SPORTLNG INTBLLIGENCE. TATTERSAIL'S, MoXADY. A niumberof members having left town for York, the room was thinly attended, and verY little business was transacted. For the Flying Dutchman's Handicap Uzetia and Zeta fell back to 6 to 1 each. and were passed by Hospitality and Puumicestone. Yellow Jack again obtained a distinct lend for the Twro Thousand, notwithstanding ine fierce demonstration whicb, Within the last two days, haddriven him back from 6 to 4 to 7to 2. An opinion prevailed in well-informed quzarters that the movement against him was a mere " ruste" Be this as it may, no strong effort on the part of his friends was required to enable him to return to-day to 2 to 1. 7 to 2 would have been taken freelyabout Porto Rico.

Tni STE&mm ADRIATiC.-The new Collins' Steamship Adriatic was successfully launched from the ways, at 10 minutes past 11 o'clock yesterday morning. The day was aU that could be desired, and thousands of spectators viewed the launch from the immediate vicinity of the yard, the tops of the surrounding buildings, the steamhoats; rowboats, and sailing vessels in the river. There was considerable delay in the launch in consequence of several vessels having to be removed from in front of the yard, but when the last block was struck away, the Adriatic glided smoothly and evenly along her ways. The immense weight of the vessel gave her a momentum which earned her completely across the river to the Williamsburgh shore. N2otwithstanding that one of the anchors (weighing 7,000 pounds) was dropped at about mid-channel, and the other when three-quarters across, she dragged both, with their heavy chain cables, as though they were mere spider threads. and came in collision with the dock, carry. Ing away some fifteen or twenty feet. It was said, however, by those on board the vessel, that not the slighlMst shock was felt, and the dock gave way so easily that no damage was done to the vessel. In addition to the dimensions already given, it may be stated that the Adriatic is the largest wooden vessel in the world, and only excelled in size by the Great Eastern, now being built in England. The Adriatic is 354 feet long, 330 feet -eel, 50 feet beam, and 33 feet 2 inches in the hold. She will have two masts, brig rig, and two oscillating engines of 100 inch cylinder and twelve feet stroke. The estimated power is 1,000 horse. The actual power is 4,000 horse. The boilers wi,l sustain a pressure of 601b. to the square inch. She will be taken to the Balance Dock, foot of Market-street, where the engines will be put in by. the buiders, Messrs. Stilman, Allen, and Co., of theNovelty Works. It is expectedthat she will be ready for her trial trip in about four months.-Nezo Yor-k Sun, April 8. Tnin RussmsNs rw LEwEs.-The constables of the borough have this morning received the follolwing communication front the officers of the Russian service:- " Lewes. April 15, 185. "We, the oincers in the Russian serviee, cannot take our departure from England without expressing our sentiments of gratitude aud goodwil towards the inhabitants of the town of Lewes and its neighbourhood. ""When, by the fortune of war, we became resident in this town, we were reicved with a frank and generous courtesy,whieheonvinced us that the Peole of Lewes regarded us less as the gubjects of a foreign and hostile 'ower than as mnen who, in the discharge of their duty, had fallen into mnisfortime. " We have enjoyed the hospitality of many, and urbano treatment from all. A somewhat lengthened Captivity has thus beeor greatly alleviated, and our pleasure in the anticipation of returnig to our native country is much modified by the regret we feel in thus bidding farewell to those vho have shown us so mulch kiadness. "'We shaU always cherish a lively remembrance of the good old town, and of the many hospitable abodes which surround it, and thus wishsin all prosperity to Lewes, we take a respectful and affectionate adieu.

SUPPOSED CASE or PoISoN1Nc.-The adjourned inquest, respecting the death of krs. Catherine Ash mall took place yesterday before Mr. W. Ward, at the Star lan, Durutwood, near Licliield, Staffordshire. Some particulars of the case appeared recently in Tire Times. It w%ill be recoUected that, in consequence of some suspicions that the deceased had been poisoned the body was exhunmed. Theinquestin the first instance was adjourned, in order that there might be an analysis of the intestines. The report of the analysis which was made by Professor Taylor was read yesterday. It stated that no trace of poiSon had been discovered, and it appeared from medical and other testimony, that the deceased had been ill for some time previous to her death, and that there was no reason to suppose that it was attributable to other than natural causes. There was nothing whatever in the evidence to justifY a supposition that the deceased had died from poison. 'The jury returned a verdict to that effect. THE MAYNooTH COLLEGE Bim.-A bill 4" to provide for the withdrawal from the CoUege of Maynooth of any endowment out of the Consolidated Fund due regard being had to vested rights or interests," las been brought into the House of Commons by M1r. Newdegate, Mr. Spooner, and M1r. Bentinck, . read a first time, and printed. The preamble recites that the privilege of ncorporation and the powers and immunities conferred on the trustees of Maynooth College, and the grant aiithorized by the act the gth and 9th of Victoria, chap. 25, "ought to be discontined.j There are four clauses only.

The Earl of MALMESBURY said, he was informed that the Irish peers were not to be allowed to participate in the privilege to be accorded by the courtesy of Her Majesty's Government to the members of their lordships' House in connexion with the review on Wednesday next. Considering the size of the ship which Was to convey their lordships to witness the spectacle, no inconvenience could arise from the extension of the privilege to the Irish peers; and he hoped, therefore, that the Government would not exclude them from its enjoyment. Lord CA3IPBELL put in a claim on behalf of the Scotch as well as the Irish peers to share in the privilege in question. The LORD CHANCELLOR stated that the onlly case which had come under his personal notice was that of a distinguished naval officer-Lord Radstock-and that noble lord would undoubtedly receive a ticket. The instructions that had been given by the Government were, that the English peers should hce provided for Sirst, and the Scotch and Irish peers afterwards; and he believed there would be no difficulty in accommodating alL The tickets were now being issued for alL. ST. JAMES'S PARK. f The Marquis of CLAINRICARDE wished to made an observation or two in relation to the proposed alterations St. James's Park. The Boardof Works, he regrettedtosa&Y, was very much inthe habit of taking its measures in in a piecemneal mode, instead of submitting a complete and mature scheme before Parliamnent. It had been announced ehewhere that Her MIajesty's Government had arrived at a decision which would deviate from the recommendation of the committee of the House of Commons. 'They had determined to open a communication between Waterloo-place and the Park, and it had been alleged that the reason why a vote for that object could not be taken this yearvas on account of the opposition offered by the inhabitants of Carlton-house-terrace. It had been stated in a newspaper that the road was to be stopped because he (the TMarquis of Clanricarde), Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Lonsdale were opposed to it; but t4e fact was, that he had nothingto do with the matter, and had never spoken a word to either of these gentlemen on the subject. There could be no doubt that the people of this metropolis did not desire their parks to he interfered wNith, unless such interference could be shown to be necessary for the business of the metropolisa consideration to which pleasure and convenience must of course give lvay. Earl GRANVILLE said, it was not the intention of the Government to proceed with any other plan than that which contemplated the opening of a new road to lead from Pall-mall to St. James's Park, by the German chapel. After a few words from the Marquis of AIANSDOWNE and the Earl of MALJIESBURY, the subject dropped. ADJOURNMENT OF THE HEOUSE. Earl GRANVILLE observed that, though it would be necessary that the Hunus should meet for appeals this day he proposed to move that their lordships should on rising adjourn for public business until Thursday. Lord CARNARVON presented petitions against the Church Discipline Bill from the clergy and laity of the diocess of Loudon; also from Stoke-Newington, and from St. Pancras, Middlesex. Lord DE-IL-WARR presentedpetitionsto the same effect from the clergy and laity of the parish of Rotherfield, in the county of Sussex, and from the parishes of Horsmonden, Lamberhurst, Goudlurst, and Brenchley, in the county of Rent. The Archbishop of CANTERBURY presented petitions to the same effect. lord REDESDALT: presented petitions to the same effect from Winchester. The Duke of NEWCASTLE presented petitions from Nottingham against the abolition of church-rates without an equivalent. INDIAN CURRENCY. The Earl of ALBEMARLE presented a petition from the European, the Chinese, and other Asiatic merchants of Singapore, remonstrating against the introduction by the Government of India of a novel and highly inconvenient currepley instead of a long-established, convenient, and satisfactory one; thereby throwing confusion into the commerce of that and the associated British settlements in the Straits of Malacca. The noble lord observed that the colony from whichthispetitionemanatedwasindustriousandenterprising, and well entitled to the consideration of any Govermnent, but more particularly of one which affected free-trade principles. Thirty-seven years ago Singapore was a wretched collection of huts, inhabited by some hundreds of pirates and fishermen. Now its imports and exports ainounted to 7,000,0001. sterling, and with those of the sister settlements to 10,000,0001. Contrast this with the continent of India. For 10 years the imports to that continent had showed no increase. Indeed, they would but for this settlement of Singapore, the account of which appeared in the Parliamentary return of the revenue of Bengal, have shown a considerable decrease. In Singapore there was no land-tax, no moturpha, and, consequently, no torture, no import or export duties, no anchorage dues, nor any charge upon ships or cargoes; yet that settlement managed to meet its expenditure, and in its case a surplus of revenue was as much the rule as in that of Eiadostan it was the exception.. The currency of Singapore was a decimal one, and perhaps the most perfect that could be devised. There was a dollar dividedl into cents, half-cents, and quarter-cents. That was the coin which was best suited to the people, inasmuch as it had been the coin' used in these settlements ever since the Spaniards established a mint at M1exico three centuries ago. The act which was to inflict upon Singapore the injury of abolishing this coin was caUed the 17th of the Indian Government, and it was said that Her Majesty's Government had signi6ed their intention that if it inflicted inijury upon commerce it should be repealed. But why should this flourishing colony be made the corpus twle on which every currency quack should try his hand? -for this experiment had been tried before. When the colony was established in the year 1819 the dollar was displaced, and rupees were introduced in the proportion of 25 to 100 dollars. At the same time Java rupees and guilders were introduced at the same price. The result was the depreciation of the Spanish doUar 1S and 12 per cenS, and a consequent great depression. In 1S24 the Spanish dollar was restored as the circulating medium. In 1827 an attempt was made to introduce the sicca rupee, the most barbarous and inconvenient coin that could be imagined; but Lord William Bentinck yielded to the remonstrances of the merchants, and the attempt was abandoned. Since then the inhabitants of Singapore had been continually protesting against the introduction of the rupee. Unfortunately, the blundering India Act of 1553 established a Legislative Council which, he understood, gave satisfaction neither in Leadenhall-street nor in Cannon-row, and to which, like new Frankensteins, the Government were about to put an end. This council had, by a majority of one, with a Mr. John Peter Grant, the originator of this precious scheme, at its head, determined to i 'flict the rupee upon the merchants of Singapore. The result of this step would be that they would mulct their Eervants at Singapore of from 10 to 12 per cent. of their salaries by paying them in a foreign coin which must necessarily be at a discount; and they would be at an enormous expense inpurchasing rupees tosend intothe colony in order that they might come back as fast as they went, because they would leave a bad market to gp to a good one. Although he could understand the adoption of such a measure by the Legislative Council of India, the majority of whose measures were in violation of legislative science, he was surprised that Her Majesty's Ministers, who were professed rreetraders, should impose on commerce this heavy restriction of a barbarous metallic currency. He held in his hand a tabular statement, published by the Government, being an attempt to adapt the fractional parts of a rupee to the fractional parts of a dollar. In this he found the word " pie," with -which as applied to finance he was previously unacquainted, but which was, he supposed, used in the sense in which it was employed in a printingoffice-to describe the confusion of the whole matter. A single ine of this table showed that 101 pie were equal to 7 half-pice, 3S pice, 12 dollar pice, and 2i cents. An integer with fractions converted into an integer wvith fractions ! Tllis showed that for small sums in the dollar currency there could be found no equivalent in the rupee currency. Three times he (the Earl of Albemarle) had pleaded the cause of those whom lie now represented against the East Indian Government, and twice he had been successful. He hoped that on this, the third occasion, Her Majesty's Government would see the necessity of repealing the absurd 1Ith Act of the Indian Government, and would, by its abrogation, restore prosperity to Singapore. Earl GRAINVLLE said that thematterwas not so simple as the noble earl seemed to think. There was no doubt that the Spanish dollar had been displaced, but it never was alegaltender, and never had been aulthoritativelysettled as such. In 1854 changes were made in the circulating medium, and on being reported to the home Government they expressed some doubt as to the expediency of the measures taken, and desired the results to be carefully watched wvith the view of ordering an alteration, if it should be deemed necessary. CHURCH DISCIPLINE. The LORD CHANCELLOR moved the second reading of this bill, the object of which, he said, was to introduce an improved system of what was called church discipline, and, generally, an amendment in the administration of the cclesiastical courts. These courts bad from remote ages exercised jurisdiction in many matters, tome of which were p urely of a temporal character, some of a mixed character, and others of a purely ecclesiastical nature. They had exercised jurisdiction, with respect to the probate of wills and the payment of leencies, which he considered matters of purely a temporal character; they had also exercised jurisdiction in matters matrimonial, and had the right of granting divorces, not so as to enable -Sons to aarry again, but divorces a enisscl et thoo-o, whicl enabled married people to live separately and gave them independent rights to a certain extent. That might be considered matter of a mixed character by some, as the celebration of marriage was accompanied by a religions san'ction; but he regarded it as matter purely for temporal oognizance. These courts had jurisdiction in a number of other matters purelY -ecclesiastical, such as the correction of clerks. who misconducted themselves, and- the decision in rPret to persons who set u pews in churches. '-TwO years a go h e introduced a bill .t to t rafe from these. courts their jurisdiction in matters testamentary, a*& he hada lkewise brought in a bill for constituting a new.court. for the decision of subjects relating to marriage and diVorce. An observation was, however, made that it was n ot proper to introduce such measuret without pointing out what pro- vision the Government meant to make for the future conduct of the .eclesiastical courts in respect to these.&atters, which would still remain under their jurisfdictio f 'Bee did moct know that le quite felt the force of that o§Bersmtion,but, as it 'was repeated, the Government thogglit it their duty to m ake known the course they recomiae 4 sbould I be taken in resjpec to what they corxsidered the purely ecclesiasticaluarto the iurisdiction of the courts; andtherefora xt was that he askled their lordships to gie a Second reaing to the present bill. He had also introduced a bill relating to the matrimonial part of the question, that relating to the testamentary having been introduced in the House of Commons, because it comprehended matters of comnensation and pecuniary charges on the consolidated fund. Their lordsahips were aware that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction was exercised in courts provincial, courts diocesan, and in a umaber of smaller courts which might be considered excrescences from the diocesan courts, and from some of vnhich the appeal was to the diocesan courts, and from others to the archiepiscopal courts. In 1832 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners reported that there were no less than 300 of these smaller courts. From the archiepiscopad courts there was an appeal in ancient times to the See of Rolue; bat that was done away with in the reign of Henfy VIM. and there was established an appeal to delegates, sometimes called an appeal to the nang iChancery. The party appealing appealed to the Crown in the Court of Chancery, and the Lord Chancellor ws authorized to create certain conmissioners, called delegates, to act as a court of appeal pro Afc vice. The practice was to name one or two temporal judges, one or two practising advocates in Doctor's-commons, and some other high ecclesiastical persons, who were to inquire into the matter on which the appeal was made. This was the last court of appeal known in ecclesiastical matters; but the King being supreme in all ecclesiastical as well as civil cases was not finaly bound by its decision, but might grant what was called a comnmission of revision. lThis was only done invery strong cases, and the power to grant the commission was in the Lord Chancellor. Such was the state of the ecclesiastical courts until quite modern times ; and, with some modifications, was their state now. In the last year of the reign of George IV. a commission was directed to certain learned persons to inquire into the whole state of these courts, and 15 commissioners, he believed, were appointed, among whom were the most distinguished prelates and ornaments of the legal profession, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, Lord Tenterden, Sir N. Tindal, and Dr. Lushington. in their report they pointed out the unsatisfactory state of the courts with respect to their purely ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The course of proceeding when a charge of misconduct was brought against a clergyman was ciumbrous, dilatory, and expensive. Articles signed by an advocate were exhibited against him in the ecclesiastical court, to which a plea in writing, called a responsive allegation, was put in; to this another allegation uight be put in by the other side, and witnesses were then examined, upon written interrogatories, in support of these respective allegations, to a most inconvenient extent. The commissioners recommended improvements, but did not point out exactly what they were to be, and the matter slept until 1840, when the act of the 2d and 3d of Victoria, chap. 86, was passed. That act authorized the bishon, in the case of complaint against a clergyman, to issue a commission of inquiry to a certain number of persons. to be selected by himself, but to include either his icar-general or chance or, or his archdeacon, who were to inquire into the validity of the charges. The clerk against whom compLaint was made wvas to be cited bcefore the commission, witnesses were to be examined, and when the question had been fully investigoated a report as to whether api-isidfczcie ease had been established for further proceedings was to be made to the bishop. If that report was in the negative the matter dropped; if it was in the affirusative articles of charge were to be exhibited, witnesses were to be e.xamined, and the case was te be determined by the bishop assisted by three assessors, one of whom was to be an advocate or barrister, the second the dean, or the chancellor, or some other functionary belonging to the cathedral, and the third any one whom the bishop pleased to appoint. An appeal was given from the bishop to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and any archbishop or bishop who was a m ember of the Privy Council was authorized to act as a member of the Judicial Com- I mittee for the purpose of hearng such appeaL This maclhinery was found to be so unmanageable and inconvenient that instead of being better it was almost worse than the old system. The investigation by the commissioners had not the safeguard of a trial, and, at the same time, was far too cumbrous for a preliminary proceeding. In one case, that of "Parnell v. Craig," the proceedings were commenced in: March, 1845, and the commissioners, after an inquiry vhich extended over nine days, agreed upon a report. Mr. Craig was not satisfied with it, and, in November, 1845, carried it into th¢ Court of Arches, where it remained hung up at a great cost until?] ovember, 1847; it was then taken to theJudicialCommittee, which, in March, 1849, four years after proceedings wvere first instituted, determinied that there was no ground of complaint against the defendant, and he was accordingly set free, after having been put to enormous expense. He believed that the court over which his noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice presided had decided that when proceedings had once been institated the aib4hbishop could not refuse to exercise his jurisdiction. Lord CAM-PBELL.-Not after the commissioners have reported thlat there is a primdafacie case for further proceedings. The LORD CHA NCELTOl-This state of things was so unsatisfactory that, in 1847, the Bishop of London introduced a bill to redress some of its anomales. The principal provisions of that bill were, that after articles had been exhibited against a clerk the bishop was to summon him, and, with the assistance of the vicar-general and a special commissary as assessors, or by the vicar-general alone, to make inquiry and pronounce sentence. In case of disputes as to matters of fact, vut voce evidence was to be adduced, andapanelof beneficedelergymentobesummoned,from which a jury of four was to be selected for their deternination. VWhere a clergyman was charged with offencees of heresy and false doctrihe the act of 1840 was swept away, and up to the - proceedings before the court of final appeal the proceedings were to be just as they were before the reporb of 1832 Instead of the final appeal to the Court of Delegates, the bill transferred the appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The bil proposed also that the court of appeal should consist of the two English archbishops, the Lord Chancellor, three English bishops, the MIaster of the Rolls, the Vice-Chancellor, three puisne judges; the Dean of Arches, the Chancellor of London, and four divinity professors. So that this tribunal was composed of not less than 17 persons, nine of whom were ecclesiastical and eight laymen. Of course it was imupossible to get such a body together, and the bill provided that the quorum should be reduced to nine -five ecclesiastics, three laymen, and one layman-the judge of an ecclesiastical court. That was an appeal on charges of heresy and false doctrine for England alone. In Ireland, although the church was called the established church of England and Ireland, there was no appeal, and the decision rested finally with the arcbishop. That was the bill brought in by the Bishop of London in 1847. It never went further than a select committee in 1847. The bill was reintroduced in 1848, and, he believed, again in 1849. Nothing was done; so that this change, which had been declared to be so necessary, remained stillto be accomplished. Their lordships were aware that in the last few years a great deal more discussion than formerly had taken place at the meetings of convocation. In 1853 a report was made on this .subject by a committee of the Upper House of Convocation, towhich he begedto call their lordships' attention. That comnunittee, whose report was dated Februarg fl,1853,cameto thefollowing resolutions: That they are unannoudy of opinion that the present state of the lair touchin, the discipline of the clergy is unsatisfactory, and that it needs amendment. That the great expenses and delays attending such proceedings, wbich amount frequently to a denial of justice, have not been removed by the recent acts upon this subject. That the provisions of the last act, which governs the present administration of the law, are inadequate for their purpose. That the preliminary inquiry under that act savours too much of an actual trial, without its safeguards or conclusion- while it has been doubted w hether those provisions, which were intendedtogoverntheactual trial couldsafely be used for its conduct. That the present provision for hearing and deciding final appeals is not such as to give general satisfaction. That it is highly important that these evils should be corrected. That, in the judgment of the committee, it is desirable that all causes agaistclerks involving questions of heresy or false doctrine, blasphemy or schism, should be heard as they might have been before the passing of the act 2d and 3d of WEilliam IV., c 92, saving as regards the composition of the court of fn appeaL They would suggest the expediency of considering whether the best solution of this question would not be to restore this jurisdiction to the Queen in Chancery, and to enable Her Majesty, when any appeals shall be presented from the court of the province in matters ecclesiastical, in which any clerk in holy orders shall be a party, except in causes matrimonial or testamentarv, to remit the cause for rehearing in the court of the archbishop, providing that there should sit under the authority of the great seal, with the judge of that court, other ecclesiastical and common law judges to hear and decide finally in the caune." Nothing, howrever, was dene in pursuance of these recommendations, and when, in 1854, the Government were told that they had been guilty of shortcominginbringingin their Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill without showfing how they meant to provide for other branuches of this subiect, it was necessary for the Government to make up their inids with regard to a measure upon church discipline. The present bill, with some slight modifications, was framed last year and submitted to the Archbishop of Canterbury, with a request that he would consult any of his right rev. brethren with whom he might have an opportunity of discussing the subject. He must admit that he received very little encouragement from his most rev. friend, for on the 11th of June, 1855, he received a letter from his most rev. friend, stating that the bill had been taken into consideration by such of the bishops as he had been able to consultk and that he regretted to say their opinion was unfavourable. They believed that the tendency of the bill was to transfer the appeal from the bishop to the archbishop, and from the archbishop to the Crown. The court of appeal provided by the biUl the bishops regarded as a more desirable body than that vhiclh now existed, but less so than the court recommended by the committee of convocation. He need hardly say that he received this communication with respectful attention, but he was unable to see in what respect the objection was well foundedthat the tendency of the bill was to transfer the appeal from the diocesan bishops to the archbishops, and from the archbishops to the Crown. He therefore thought it his duty to submit a bill to their lordslups which unfortunately had not received the sanction of the right rev. prelates. Under all the circumstances, he believed he should have been guilty of a dereliction of duity if le had not stepped in to supply the deficiency. On the day before the Raster recess he laid the present biU i n the table; and it Was soinewlhat remarkable that on the day previous to his-doing so the Lower House of Convocation made a report to the Upper House-on this very subject. Thatroport,withoutexptessmganyverygdefinite opinions,siig gested the following two modes of constituting a satisfactory court of appeal :-First,byaddingtotheJndicial Committee, pro Me r ice, 15 ecclesiastics frons England and Iieland, including the-archbishops, four bishops, two divinity professors from Oxford, two more divinity professors from Cambridge, one from Durham, and another from Dublin, The second plan recommended the formationWof a special court of appeal, under the Royal sign manual, but subject to the arobbishonps bishops, and a number of profeaorv of divinit;y. The right rev. prelate (theBishopof Exeter),who had moved that a copy of the bill of 1847 be laid on the table, had him.I self IntroduOUe thAi bill 9i,5--k -: _ *h iit sedthroug co mmittee in 1847. Theiz lordship,s therefore, had no other course open to them but either to stand still anddo nothing, or tomaketheirchoicefrom thetwo billsbeforethem. The measure of the right rev. prelate proposed that the articles should be filed and served on the person charged, who would then be tried before the bishop of the diocess with his vicar-general,or chancellor, or some special counsel, as his assessor; that questions of fact should be tried by a jury of four beneficed clergymen; but that on ouestions of heresy or false doctrine the final-appeal should bie to the 17 persons before mentioned. On other questions than those of false doctrine the appeal was, in England, to lie to the Judicial Committee of Privy Council, and in Ireland to a Court of Delegates. This plan was opento thegravest objections. It would enable the bishop to relieve himself, if he chose, from responsibility by casting the duty upon his assessor. The assessor, who in that case wouldbe the judge, was to be the bishop's chancellor, if properly qualified; or, if not qualified, then an advocate of some standing. Now, there were 28 diocesan chanceUlors in England, and 14 of them were clergymen. No doubt the right rev. pre, late's ovn chancellor (Chancellor Martin) was as able a man as existed, but it was not probable that these gentle. men, asabody, would impress the aublic with a beiief of their competency for the exercise of such functions. Again, df the 26 vicars-general or chancellors in Ireland, 17 were eccleiastics and only 9 lawyers. Such a tribunal was, therefore, eminently unfitted for the trial of any question in which judicial habits were necessary. A question of heresy and false doctrine which had to be decided by human tribunals did not consist of this-whether, looldng at the matter in A sniritual sens, the one party or the other was right; but whether, according to the construction of the Act of Uniformity, or the canons, articles, or other ecclesastical enactments, the maintaining of such and such a doctrine was prohibited by law; and to decide that ecclesiastics, were not only not the best, but the very worst judges. Then, again, as to questions of fact; when a clergvaian was accused of inimorality why should four beneficed clergymen be better than a common jury ? Any. thing giving the court a peculiarly ecclesiastical character, and making it a ppear something that it was not, *as to be carefully avoidea The bill of the right rev. prelate contemplated that in trying questions not prin4dfacc relating to heresy such questions might incidentally arise; and that then the archbishops, several of the bishops, the Lord Chancellor, certain of the E3nglish judges, and the professors of divinity should be summoned to adjudicate. This would cause the greatest delay, and, instead of a year ortwo-as at present-half-a.cent-ury would elapse before the decision of such a tribunal could be obtained. This brought him back to the original cknrt of appeal proposed by the right rev. prelate's bill, which, he believed, would be incompetent for the discharge of its duties. He objected to a court so constitated, because it was a tribunal which from its very nature would be necessarily ecclesiastical, and would not comprehend that it was its duty to decide according to law, and not according to what mighthe understood to h1s the true interpretation of any question deduciblefrom IolyWrit. Hewouldnow statein what manner the Government proposed to grapple with this difficult subject. In the first place, it was of the greatest importance that there should be a competent assessor or judge to act with or for the bishops. The present bllu did not propose to destroy the diocesan courts, but to constitute four ecclesiastical judges-chancellors if they pleased-who should supersede throughout the country the present vicarigeneral, who, though there were no doubt some exceptions, were for the most part inefficient. (Hear, hear.) It was thought proper that these judges, chancellors, or assessors, should be selected, nzot by the Crowin, hut by the bishops themselves. (Hens, hear.) Their appointment would be vested in the two F,nglish and the twvo Irish archbishops, vdth whom would be united the Bishop of London. It was confidently expected that this ystem wvould work well, for patronage was alvwaysmost judiciously distributed where there was direct resnonsibility and a conviction that the a pointments made would he critically scanne. (Hear hear. Itwas proposed that of these four assessors two sbou dbefor England andtwo for Lreland-their mazi7ason salary to be 3,0001., and their minintunez 2,0001. a-year. lue cases involving doctrine the bishop would preside by himself, although he might, if he pleased, have an assessor with him; and mn matters not relating to doctrine the bishop would delegate the whole business to the chancellor, who vould be for that purpose a judge. The bill contemplated that there might be disputed facts, and such facts would be decided by a jury of four persons, not beneficed clergymen, hut selected from the common roll of special jurors. VWith respect tothecourt of appeal, thattribunalwouldconsist as at present, of the Judicial Comoittee, but, inasmuch as it would be a court of appeal for Ireland as well as England, the bill proposed that an Irish prelate should be at liberty to attend it, as under the old law an English bishop, being a Privy CounciUor, was similary privileged. It was of importance to determine where the fun esesential for the carrying out of the system contemplated by this bill should come from; and, as the fees now received from diocesan sources in England and Ireland would he inadequate for the purpose, it was proposed to abolish the present diocesan regisries, and to consolidate them all into one great metropolitan registry, at which it would be the dity of the chancellors to be in constant attendance to superintend the drawing up of ecclesiastical instruments-a matter of great momuent. There would be a sum of 38,0001. to provide for the general registry and its officers. After paying these expenses, there would remain a surplus which, with the view of affording to the bishops good legal advice alw.ays at tlseir elbows, ho proposed to appropriateto the payment of salaries of from 2(01. to 300.. a-ear TO their secretaries. Such were the pronisionsof the bill That the measure was perSect hedid net pretend to say; that the subject was beset with difficulthes he was sure that their lordships would all admit. He had endeavoured to frame a bill which should unite the advantages of making these proceedings cheap and espeditious; and this he must say he had by this measure attained, because under its provisions the cost would be as nearly nothing as it could possibly be in the case of nny legal proceedings. HIehadprovidedgoodlegaladviceforthebishops, a proper assessor to act as the assistant or the substitute of the bishop, efficientmachinery for the trial of disputed facts, and a better tribunal of ultimate a ppeal than had been suggested either in the bil of the right rev. prelate or from any other quarter. He should be wiling to answer any suggestions which might be made by his right rev, friends. It was a matter of regret to him that his measure should not only by many of them be regarded with unfriendly eyes, but should not have received the support of those for whose support he was most anxious; and he could assure them that it had been conceived with no intentional hostility towards themselves or their offices. The noble lord concluded by moving the second reading of the bilL The Archbishop of CANTERBURY rose with unfeigned reluctance to oppose6the bill which had been proposed to tIeir lordships by the noble and learned lord.- He was sensible of the responsibility which he incurred by objecting to a measure introduced by such high authority on a subject part of which at least was generally ackloovledged to require the interference of the Legislature. StiU he confessed that mitch of the embarrassment which he might otherwise feel on this occasion was relieved by the strong conviction which he entertained that the bill in question had received little other benefit from the patronage of the noble and learned lord than its introduction under the sanction of his name, and the powerful advocacywith which he hadnow explained its nature to their lordseips. He felt satisfied that if his noble and learned friend had designed to be the author of a measure affecting the administration of the affairs of the church in the degree in which thev were affected by this bilL he would not have allowed those wlio were most interested in those affairs to hear of his intention for the first time when a bil of nearly 200 clauses was laid upon the table; he would have folloved the course which a long and honourable legal career had made fanmilar to him; he would have examined into the facts of the case; he would have sought out vwitnesses to prove the facts; he would have consulted those who were conversant with the matters treated of; he would have required evidence of the things requiring remedy, and would have provided what the occasion needed, and nomore. Re would nothaveproposed to overthrow the whole system on which the afairs of the church had been hitherto adniinistered, without proof of its necessity. He would not have introduced a machinery altogether new and complicated, without securing a prospect of its working well and easily, to the satisfaction of the parties concerned. He (the Archbishop of Caanterbury) had alluded to one source of embarrassment arising out of his opposition to this bilL It was not the only one. He had another cause of uneasiness in the fact that the bill had received the sanction of his brethren on the Irish bench, and in particular was supported by the most rev. primate, whose authority must deservedly have gre?t weight with their lordships, who knew how long he had presided over over the Irish branch of the church, with so much much advantag to the interests of religion. LI the unity of the church oflEngland and Ireland, towhich the noble and learned lord had alluded, depended on the passing or the rejection of the bill, or was at all affected by it, he, for one, would not oppose it. That unity must not be disturbed. Happily, there was no such danger. That which was essential to the unity of two branches of the same church was not their discipline, but their doctrine, and to that identity he allowed it to be necessary that there sbould be for both countries the same court of finaLl appeaL This must be provided for by some alteration of the present appellate jurisdiction. But it was not necessary that their mode of administering the ordinary affairs of the church should be in all respects the same. It was very possible that the changes which had taken place in the Ibish branch of the church during the last twenty years-the suppression and consolidation of sees-might require a fresh organization of their registries, and, for oughthe knew, have rendered acentral registrydesirable. Suchwas notthe case in England, where our diocesan registries were correctly kept, and easily accessible. He trusted, therefore, that their right rev. colleagues would preeive that no disrespect was shown them if tie English bishops declined to adopt a change of system which was totally une-alled for, and would be simply inconvenient in the dioceses in England. It was not his intention to follow the noble and learned lord through the details of the bil, and to show its objectionable ebaracterbothin principle and practice. Their lordships must have already seen how little it corresponded with its title, as a bill "for better enforcing church discipline, and the laws ecclesiastical." A great part of it might more justly be described as a bill for putting the ecclesiastical authority in comiission. And this for no imaginable purpose, except to provide a remuneration for certain officers under the name of chancellors, whose only business it would be to sign and seal documents which they had or ought to have no concern in faming, and to sit as assessors to 3 bishop when a charge of delinquency was brought against any of his clergy. He was happy to say that such charges were not so frequent as to require such expensive provision. The amendments which the Present act on cihurch discipline confessedly reqluired might bemiade wvitboub a. total chang e ef the exsktiag eccvlesistival sptem, mh6 be truste, would be proved in the course of the evening to their lordshipsP entire satisfaction. He onlg regretted that the usage s. of hu-House didnotperiithisn to £hape the motion tfit which he should conclude in-terns hich sounded more courteous than tht the further consideration of this bill be postponed until that *lay six months. The Bishop of DEREY said that when this subject wAs under discussion last year the archbishops aud bishops of Ireland held a meeting, at which they adopted the following resolutions- "The Irish archbishops, and bishops are unanimous in their desire that there may be one court of final appeal for the united church of Eugland and Ireland, and that in the consitution of that oourt the Queen's supremacy should be maintained intact. They therefore approve the court of appeal in the proposed Churh Discipline and Registry Bil, and they cannot give their -sanction to- the recommenda'on of the committee of the Convocation of Canterbuty, which would make the decisions of the Queen in Chancery or Court of Delegates fiial, thereby withdrawing from the Queen in Council the power of reviewing all such decisions -aporwerwhichnowbelongs,andforagee pasthas belonged, Lo the Sovereiga in Council. "The Irish a-chbishops and bishops ara convinced that the church would derive great advantage from comh- the several diocesan registries -into a well orpnized =t registry. And they are ready to forego their private patronage i this respect, feelig t at they ought not to allow a regard for their personal or family interests to stand it the way of a reform demanded by the voice of the country. "The Irish archb!shops and bishops deem it to be of great importance to the colomalchurch that a finalcourt of appeal i ecclesiastical matters should speedily boe established, in irder to secure uniformity in doctrine and disciplinu throughout the colonial dioces. "Eor thee reasons. the Irish archbishops and bishop-s are anLuimous in wishing that the bill prepared by direction of the Solicitor-General should be brought into Parliament, reserving to themselves the right of suggesting amendments inthedetail3 of the hill when it is passing through the. aouse of Lords." rhe Irish prelates also drew up the following memoril to Lord Palmerston: " The archbishops and bishops of the provcines of Armagh and Dublin beg leave to submit to the Viscount Palmerston the following statement with reference to the draught ofaproposed bill, entitled " The Church Discipline and liegistry Act, 1855,' which ws preared, under the directhon of the Solitor-General for England, by Mr. Stephens, and which was communicated to the Iish prelates in the course of the last summer. "A letter on the subject of this bill was addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Lord Cllancellor of Great Britain on the l1th of June, stating certain objections against the measure on the part of his G(race and twelve of the English bishops assembled at Lambeth. Their objections were as follows :-l. The tendency of the measure ' to trans-' ferthejurisdiction of the diocesanbishops to the archbishops;' 2, 'and that of the archbishop to the Crowrn;' 3, that ' the court of appeal w hich it proposes, though anL imp?rovement upon the p resent lawt, is less desirable than one which was suggested last year by a committee of convoation, the report of which was laid upon the table of the "An opportumity having been afforded for the consideration of the proposed bill at a meeting of English and Irish prelates, held at the Bounty-offive on the 19th of June, the frstand second oftheforegoing objections were fully discussed. Andin a letter, dated the 224 of June, addressed to the Solicitor-Genera, the Irish prelates then in Londont expressed their opinion that the proposed measure should be altered so as to obviate those two objections. But, with respecttothethirdobjection, the Irish prelates were oE opiion that the court of final appeal, suggested by the commlittee of eonvocation, was inconsistent with the legal supremacy of the Csown, and that the appellate tribunal proposed in the bill should be adopted. " The counsel who drew the bill having been recently requestedtostateif itcouldbe amended so as to meet the views of the English prelates without violating its principles, the Irish prelates have had laid before them an amended draught of a bill, with a letter explanatory of the amendments, which appear to them not only to remove the first -two objections mentioned in the letter to the Lord Chancellor, but also to improve the bill in other respects in a manner calculated to be satisfactory to the English prelates And as the court of appeal which would be constituted by the bill is admaitted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, on the part of himself and 12 of the English bishops, to he an improvement upon the present law, the Irish prelates earnestly hope that the amended bin l my prove acceptable to their lordshiep "W lNth%out p.dgi&g themselves to details, the lIish prelates desire to express their unanimous conviction of tlhe urgent necessity which exists for this measure of ecclesiastical reform; and especialy if thetestamentay jurisdiction be removed from the church courts (which in that case must hereafter be supported by ecclesiastical business exclusively), they think it essential that the church courts and the ecclesiast;ical registries should be dealt with together, so as to mfake them self-supporting. "They are also of opinion that the plan of reducing the number of chancellors would be for the advantage of the church, as giving encouragement to persons of eminence to devote themselves to the study of ecclesiastical law. And they apprehend, that, unless this plan be adopted when the testamentary jurisdiction is withdrawn from the church courts there would not be sufficient funds to afford adequate remuneration to qualified chancellors for each of the dioceses. The provision made in the amended bill for the payment of the secretaries of the prelates is, they conceive, a satisfactory solution of any dirficulties which might arise from the concentration of the registries. " They have also to submit that, as the fifth article of tfe Acts of Union of Great Britain and Ireland provides ' that the churehes of England and Ireland, as now by law established, be unitedinto one Protestant episcopal churrch, to be called the United Chur cof England andreland; andthat the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government of the said united church shall be and shall remain in full force for ever as the same are now by Law established for the church of England,' it is essential, in order to prevent conflicting decisions in the united church, that there should be but one court of final appeal for the church in England,- Ireland, India, and the colonies. " The Irish prelates submit this statement totheViscount Palmerston, in order that Her Mfajestys G overnment may be in possession of their sentiments, in case it should be ia -ontemplation to bring forward any measures in the next sesQsion of Parliament for the regulation of the ecclesiastical courts of the unitedkingdom " It having been reported that ' the Church Discipline and Begistry Act' origmated with the prelates of the church in Ireland, they think it right to state that such report was unfonnded; inasmuch as they were not aware of its provisions, or even of its existence, until after it had been drawn uphy l,lr.Stephens,underthe direction of theSoliciturGeneral for En"land. "Dublin, Nov. 29, 1855." This. document as signed by two archbishops and by all the bishops of the Irish church. After the clear and convincing statement of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, tt might seem needless for him to trespass on their lordshipj aitention, but, agreeingwith the Archbishop of Armagh agd his brethren of the Irish episcopacy in opinion that the bill before the House was substantially a good one, he felt it his duty not to give merely a silent vote. He and hisb ight rev. brethren were deeply interested in the passing of a comprehensive measure, useful and necessary for the Irish church, and a confirmation-if he might so expre-s himself-of tnat great incorporation wvhen the Legislatures of tlhe two countries were happily, and lie trustved f or ever, united. By the Act of Union the church of England and Ireland were declared to be united into one Protestant episcopal church, to be called the " United Church of England and Lreland"J and it was also declared that the doctrine, torship, discipline, and government of the same church should remain in full force for ever as by law established. Upon thathe took his stand, and any bill to be satisfactory to the Irish branch of the church, as well as beueficial to the English branch, miust maintain the identity of the two branches. He was aware that it was statedthattheIrish canons were not identical with the English canons but there was no man, well acquainted wth ecclesiastical matters, who did not know that canons were not essential elements of the church. They had been different at different times and places; and the canons of York had differed from the caons of Canterbury. Such being the case, the bi31 now before the House had his complete approbation. He did not mean to say that it might not be improved in detail and made more acceptable to the English prelates; buta bill which maintamned one appellate tribunal, witha due admixture of the English and Irish preltes, and civil and ecclesiastical authorIty, was a satisfactorv one. He also expressed his approval of the appointment of assessors, and sa;d that an examination of the bill would show that the authority of the Irish as well as the English prelates would be maintained. With respect to the registries there might be a difference of opinion; but in Ireland much inconvenience had been felt from the want of proper registries, and from the absence of the means for their proper maintenance, though it was of the greatest moment that they shohid be duly maintained. For these reasons the bill had his approbation, and he regrett.ed to find that he differed from the most rev, prelate, wvhons he highly esteemed, and from the Eng prelates, for whom he felt veneration ancd respet, Het however. only hoped that,whatever differences fhere might be bet6een e English and Irish prelates on this subject, their constant endeavour and prayer would be to maintain "the unity of spirit in the bond of peace." The establisbed church might labour under deficiencies, but, nevertheless, it had always been the dccus cd tutamen of the country both in England and Ireland. The Bishop of EXETER saw with great satisfaction the unanimity of the Irish and English churches with regard to the necessity of establishing a court of final appeal. It was, however, his duty to point out the objections he entertained to this bill, a painful duty which he would endeavour to fulfil as calmly and dispaonatWy as possible. He agreed with thezight rev. prelate who had just spoken that tlere could be no real and substantial unity in the church without unity of doctine, and he had hoped until to-night that the church was in that state of unity; but ie deeply regretted to learn from the speech of the right rev, prelate that there were some members of the episcopal bench who did not think it ws necessary to preserve en tire the autthority of a diocesan bishop ever the clerks in his diocess. He declared that if the church of Ireland looled upon the principle of this bill as tolerable in, a Christian chrch, he could not holdhimself in communion with the church of Ireland.- The 15th clause diEstinctly withdrew authority from the diocesan bishops and vested it in the archbishop-at the pleastre of the archbishop. It provided that any clerk agabnst whom a complaint was made might petition the archTishop to hear and determine his cauVse, and that the archbishop might, if he thouaght fit, hear and.determineit accordingly. He appealedto the Rouse to say whether this clause did not remove the authority of tho bishop over the clerks in his diocesand vest it in the atchbishop. (HIear,hear.) Yet the rightrev.parelte thought it a soundand wholesome provisions If' the Irish church did not admit the sacrel origin, the divine right of diocesant eiSCopacy t2,ey separated themselves from the churc4 af Engand; be woud go uher-they sepazited

He then stated that his predecessor at the Board of Works had considered two plans, one of which has been sent in by Mr. Baily and the other by Mr. Foley, but that aftercarefii consideaMtion, neither of those plans was approved. He (Sir B. Hall) also stated that, soon after he camne into office, he saw the models which he had reason to believe, from the statements made to him, had been prepared by Mr. Baily and 3Mr. Foley. He had, however, received a communication from Mr. Foley, informing him that the plans to which he had referred were those of Mr. Baily alone. Ie (Sir B. Hall) might observe that it was his intention to invite those gentlemen to send in plans again. THE BUILDINGS IN THE PARKS. Lord E. LEYNNOX asked the Clerk of the Ordnance whether, before issuing orders for the commencement of the temporary buildings now in course of erection in Hiyde Park and in Green Park, communications were made to his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge as the Ranger of those parxks with a view to obtaining his Royxl Highness's sanction and approval; and, if not, whv it was not done, and upon whom rests the responsibiibty of the omision? Mr. MONSELL was sorry to state that no application was made in the first instance to the Ranger of Iyde Park for his permission to erect the building in progress of construction there; bust themoment the omission was discovered anapologywas offered to his Royal Highness, who graciously received it, and immediately gave his sanction to what had been done. THE CELEBRATION OF PEACE. In reply to Mr. BRADY, Sir G. GREY stated that he had no intention to make arrangements for throwiing open the public places of amusement (free) to the public dunng the intended rejoicings on account of the restoration of peace. In answver to a question from Mr. KEN;RD, Sir G. GREY stated that the Government had come to no decisionas to the appointment of a day of thanksgiving on account of the same happy event. But, he added,-these questions wrere rather paematuie; no proceedings co'uld be adopted until after the: ratifications, which had, not yet been received.- SEATPOCAR - - - -- 2~ Mr. BATT;IL1E, referring to i statement made hy t2he Under-Secretaryfor Waron Friday evening, that none.bult combatant offlcers were to receive the: Sebastopol clasp, intquied whether the Waz-office had decided thaw aurgeos ateding the wounded under fire or Commissariat of lcer3s binE up supplies duiang action were non-combataneg! Hle asked that question because he understood that thoso medical and Commissariat officers who were still at Sebas. topol had received the clasp, wwhle thome who had zetred siae the cith y was taken had been refused it Mr. PEEL could ony repeat the answer Which he gave nTdy, that, as a guenal. rule, u10one but comblatat liehi eeowre teivcasp Poriot of actions, bui fao r ofmdcl fies on the ground Shit thywr hea no av nswerdta ton of the quetio hch hre ferred to thedlisnction made betweenthenedicaland Com missariat officers remaining in the Crimea and those who had returned homne. Mr. pEL explained that before the general rule which he had described came into operation number of Cormnis sariat offlcers reeved the Sebastopol clasp, whEich they had not since been requested to return, although the same distinction had not been conferred upon the remzainiing officers in the same department. (A laugh.) COUTY COURTS. In reply to a question from Mr. RozBucn, Sir G. GREY stated that it was the intention of the Lora Chancellor to proceedwith the bill which he hd introduced into the other House with respect to County Courts ; but it was impossible to say whether it would be passed during the present session. AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS. In reply to Mr. HENLEY, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER stated that the second reading of the Agricultural Statistics Bill woula not be taken before Friday next week. THE FIEWORKS IN THE PARKS. In answer to Captain VExnox, Mr. MONSEIL stated that the expenses of the forth. coming pyrotechnic display in the metropolis would be included in the estimte ,for civil contingenes. It was true that Captain Boxer had been charged wvith the mnnfacture of the firewrork s, and that it ws under his superintendence and that of the architect emnployed at Wooolwich that the v;oden buildings had 'oeen erected in the parks The Chief Commissioner of Works, in the construct;on of those buildings, had acted ministeriy, under the direc. tions of the Secretary of State. ML-. REOEBUCK.-By whose authority have these expenses been incurred' (Cheers from the pposition.) Mr. 3fONSELL.-That of the Secretary of State? -Mr. ROEBUCK-What Secretary of State?7 -Mr. MONSELL.-The Secretary of State for War, with the concurrence of the Chancllor of the Exchequer. The CHANCEL1;OR of the EXCHEQUER moved that the House at its rising adjourn to Thursday next. lMr. ROEBUCK wished to Inow if the expense of the firev,orks which were to be exhibited would be defrayed out of the fund for civil contingencies? The CHANCELWTAR of the EXCHEQUER.-It appears to me that such a course is in perfect accordance with what took-place after the last peace. (A laugh.) The expense has been limited by the Secretary of State to 8,0001., and there wvill be fireworks in Hyde Park, in the Green Park, in the Victoria Park, and also on the top of Primrose-ll That appears to me to be a reasonable sum to expend, and we propose that it shall be paid out of the fund for civil contingencies. Lord J MANNERS considered that until the terms and nature of the peace were rnade known it waBs prematur.e to make any demonstration of such a nature; and he wished to ask Her 3ajesty`s Government whether, as it was deter. mined that this display of fireworks should not tale place before the ratifications were exchanged and the procma. tion of peae made, it would not be desirable to postpone it altogether until that House and the counnr had tim afforded them to form an opmion as to the terms upoxn which peace had been concluded? (Hear, hear.) Sir G. GREY.-I can only repeat, that the course which we propose to adopt is in strict accordance with former pre. cedent except inasmuch as we propose to have a display of firzeworks in the Victoria Park, w;hich ws not in existence, atthe time of the last peace. If the noble lord wilI referto former treaties of peace, he will see that no proclamation of peace has been issued until t,he ratiftcations have taktn lace, and he will also find that at the conclusion of every nonourable war in which this country has reaped laurels, -end I believe she will always reap laurels wherever her land or sea forces are enMged-there has been some public demonstration in which the great body of the people could concur, and thereby express their satisfaction. I find that on the conclusion of the peace of Amiens illuminations and fireworks were exhibited on the very evening of the day upon whEich the pro. elamation of peace was made. This will be an exhibition of fireworks, which, I believe, the great body,f the inhabitants of the metropolis will enjoy, and it v;ill require some time for preparation; so that, if we were not to act as we are acting, mn strict conformity with precedent, but were to submit an estimate to this House, we could not bring for'ward that estimate until the ratifications take place, and the probablity is that then the display of fireworks would be so long postponed mat the enjoyment of it would be greatly dimnished. Lord EL[HO wished to Inow if it wms in strict accordance ,ith precedent for the Minister of War to order fire. works without consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer or any of his colleagues, and without asking for the permis. Eion of the Ranger? (Hear, hear.) Sir G. GREY.-The noble lord assumes that no consutation took place with the Chancellor of the Exchequer upon the subject. I am not convrersant with all the details of tho case, but 1 understood my hon. friend the Clerk to the Ordnance to state, thattheChancellor of theExchequer concurred with the arrangements which have been made. Mr. BRKDY wished to know if there was to b any display in Dublin? (oud laughter.) Sir G. GREY,-I must refer the hon. gentleman to the Lord lieutenant, by whom all orders of that descriptionl are issued, for an answer to his question. Colonel KNOX rose to ask the Chancellor of the Ex. chequer when he would lay upon the table of the house an estimate of the probable cost of the contemplated fireworks and buildings now under course of erection in the several parks of the metropolis, and of any other expenditure contemplated on the-occasion of the peace? He could not conceive why, if the ratifications of the treaty of peace were expected soon-and he presumed that they were-the Chancellor of the Excheqcuer could not lay on the table an estimate of the expendlture. The omission which had taken place in not applying to the Ranger for permiSon, for which an apology had been made, was, he thought, a very sexious one to be made by a department of the Government; for he believed that no communication was made to his Xoyal Hghness at all upon the sub;ect until he complained of his consent not hav-ng been ased for. There had also been other omissions, for the works in the park had been commenced upon the 10th of April, and no communication had, he befieved, been made to the Minister of Works mntil the 15th of that month. He should like to know if it was competent for the Minister of War to isse orders of such a nature vithout any consultation with his colleagues in office ? It was all very well to say that the proposed arrangements met with the concur. rence of the Chancellor of the-Exchequer; but, be believed, that the orders were given without his knowledge, and that it was originally intended to defray the expense from the war fund. He thought the rejoicing very premature (hear. hear), and that it might well be postponed until the public had an opportunity of knowing what was the nature of the peace. lie did not think that the public generally were inclined to sanction this large expenditure until they knew something more of the nature of the terms of peace; and, in fact, the common phrase out of doors was. "I suppose we shallhavethe taxgatherer coming to ask us to pay for the Frenchman's peace." As to the exhibition of fireworks, they might, he thought, be productive of serious mischief. Lare crowds would be collected and accidents would probably occur, and there was little doubt that serious injury would be done to the valuable trees. As to the sum which had been mentioned by the right hon. gentleman, he did not think that it would be found sufficient if the illuminations were to be at all of a brilliant character, and he hoped that the right hon. gentleman would lay an estimate of the whole probable expense upon the table. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCIIEQUER.-It appears to me that the hon. gentleman has asked a question which to-nighthasbeenalreadyfullyns wered. Icanonlyrepeatthat the Government believe themselves to have introduced no innovation and to have done nothing unprecedented. The Government would have been failing in their duty had they not made some reparation for testifying rejoicings at the ternination of thsetru,gle in which we ave been engaged. Similar preparations hiavo alwgays been made upon former occasions-not only at the peace of 1814, but at the ter. mination of a treaty of peace which gave rise to much criticism, a peace of which it was said that everybody was glad of it, but everybody was ashamed of it-I mean the peiace of Amiens. As to the sum of 8 '0001., which wi not, I thn,b exceeded, that is scarcely a matter for serious citicism in this house, and I see noreason for departing from the announcement which I have already made, that it is notthe itentionof the Government to submit a formal estimate to this House, hut that this suns will be paid from the fund placed at the disposal of the Executiva +3nee extraordmary contingencies. - -- Lord J. wANNERS did not think the reference to the peace of Amiiens a happy one. He wished, however, to repeat his opinion that this demonstration ouyght t-o be postponed unti the country had heard what was the nature of the peace. Sir G.

(Heoar, g ear.)sIicanhowever, assure the noble lord that wit. nessing t'hese fireworkcs willnot in anyway preclude him or any ot er hon. gentleman from afterwards discussing the nature of the peaoe, any more than they ar precluded because on the news of peace guns were fired and the belLs of the various churches rung. Every member of this House will be just as much at EiSerty to adopt any course which he may think fit with regard to the treaty ofpeac as if these fireworks had not been exhibited at alL (Hear, hear.) In answer to the Mlarquis of BLA-DrFORD, - Sir G. GREY said that there would be no publc fair in Hyde -Park. I Mr. DUTCOME wished to be informed whenitwas probable that the ratifications would arrive. There was a public rnmour that there was to be a period of rejoicing for a week or three days, Now he hoped that the Govein ment would recollect that the workdng classes could not make holyday an&d at the 6ae time receive wages. le did not think the -peoplewere in a humour to have three or four days -lost for the sake of all, this extreme trmpery.

A deputation, consistin" of Mr. Rickards, the chairman of the Manchester Board of Gunardians; Mr. Harrop, the Clerk of the Board, and Messrs. Low and Lings, overseers of the township, had an interview with the Right Hon. E. P. Bouverie at the office of thme Poor Lawv Board, on the subject of the bills relating to Trish and Scoteh removal and vaccination niow before Parliament. A deputation, headed by the Marquis of Clanricarde, had an interview yesterday with the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his official residence in Downiing-street. Despatches were received at the Colonial Offince yesterday from the Governors of the >North American Provinces, the Governor of Bennuda, anld the Governor of Malta. Despatches were sent to the Governors of the Australian Colonies.
We have received the Mcmitewr of yesterday. It publishes the text of a convention between Franice, Belgium, Spain, Sardinia, and Switzerland, for reg,ulating the transmission of telegraplhic despatches, but does not contain any other news of interest. COMMERCE iN CooLiEs.-Visitors to Cub%a duringr the past winiter, have had enlarged opportunities of noting the condition of the coolie apprentices, of whom thousands swarni everywhere on that lovely island. On the plantation they have seen them driven to the field or the mill, like cattle, retained at work with the lash, and whipped cruelly for idleness or insubordination. In all particulars, they wvill have noted their agrestic life suffers in comparison with that of the African, who toils at his side, for he is spared, because owned, by his master, while coolie servitude is restricted to a certain term of years ; and every interest of the sugar and tobacco cultivator lies in extracting the largest amount of service witlin that term. Those reseived for domestic offices fare better. Yet, in the cities, the corn parison between the African and Asiatic is always favourable to the former. The cooie, though of much greater intelligence, tact, and industry, is more frequently whipped, iuore constantly over-worked, more unsparingly abused. They are bought and sold precisely as the African. When by excessive cruelty they are driven to despair their refuge is suicide, opium supplying the means, and the expectation of immediate translation after death to the Celestial Empire, whence they came, the inducement. The number of suicides is represented as frightfuL The scheme of slavery, every feature of wlhich is worse in all particulars than negro servitude, sickens the traveller in Cuba at every turn; every domestic duty, including those ordinarily assigned to women, he finds executed in the housewhere he lodges bythese Orientalslaves. Slaves, nominally, for seven years; but, substantially, for life, since no provision is made for restoring them to their homes, and, whilo in Cuba, their portion is the inevitable yoke. A vessel laden wvith these ivretched creatures was cast away near Havannah on the 28th ult. It was, we regret to say, a vessel owned in New York, and well known in the mercantile marine for its speed, though certainly no evidence of that quality was afforded by its last and fatal voyage from Amoy to Cuba, four months being the time. It 'left the former port with a crowvded freight, decoyed on board doubtless by those atrocious and reckless representations which correspondents from that part of the world repeat to us as the staple of imposition upon an ignorant and guileless people. Of the 580 embarked, 80 had perished before the voyage ended. Wrhat home-sickness, discomfort, privations, and despair-what close crowding in pestiferous holds and cabin;, while twice crossig the equator-must have fed this awful ratio of death to life, we can readily imagine, wlith the aid of data furnished in other instances. Unlike the Guinea voyage, the path is long, reaching more than half round the globe. The food is proportioned, noe to the wants of the captives, hut to a nice estimate of the lowest amount upon wich human life can exist, slightly reduced in favour of the profit and loss account of the owner. No occupant of a State prison subsists upon such lenten fare. Water is doled out with equal parsimony. Discipline is of the sternest. Of course, discontent with such starvation-diet, and with the first awakening to the fact that the journey is not of a day or two, but of months, and that, instead of being free men and passengers, they are of less consideration than so many quadrupeds, is anticipated and provided against. The crew being comparatively few, the odds are made up by armingi them to the teeth. A few exwamples are alwvays made the first week out. What is the sacrifice of a-half dozen Asiatics in the scale with the safety of the captain and crew? The cruelty systematically practised upon the poor creatures in order to frighten them into abject submision and silence is described by occasional passengers in such vessels as absolutely demoniacal and heartrending. Thus, beaten, knocked down, kicked, cuffed, stabbed, thrown overboard, or shot, if more than usuaUy troublesomue; pent up in quarters filthy and thronged to that degree that those who survive the fevers thus engendered are enfeebled and wasted to the last tenuity, with no more Clothing or means of warmth when I doubling the bleak Capes at the south than when passing under the burning line, is it any wonder that the loss of bit SO out of 580 should be named as creditable to the officers of the vessel? More frequently 20 per cent. are sacrificed cn the voyage. Nay, in ono instance, the captain found it due to his safety to smother the whole cargo, over 500, beneath the hatches, notwithstanding it involved subsequently the labour of throwing the dead bodies overboarda task of considerable magnitude. And this barbarous commerce, begun in the practice of deception and falsehood upon the ignorant and needy, continued in a spirit of inhumanity at which hum.an nature recoils with honror, and ended in dooming Its victims to irretrievable slavery. employs whole fleets of ships and sweeps every ocean.-Aew Yor-k- Timfs.: Our Malta correspondent writes under date of Wednesday last :-" The Marquis of Dalhousie stil continues Lhere in much the same state, his health tolerably good, but his leg continuing so seriously bad as to prevent his moving I without assistance. It is intended that he leaves here about the 18th in Her Maiesty's ship Tribune for England direct.

LO2NDO, TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1I56. In the House of Lords yesterday, The Earl of T1IrzIrsnysrRY claimed for the Irish Peers, and Lord CAMPBELL for those of Scotland, the same facilities for attending the naval review that had been provided for the other members of the House. The LORD CLrNcmLLoit stated that tickets would be sent to the Irish and Scotch Peers. In the course of a short conversation on the proposed improvements in the park the Earl of CaxsRIcAHDE expressed his satisfaction that the Duke of YoREi's Column is not to be removed. He denied that he had been influenced by any private consider-ations in what he had said on the subject. The Earl of ALPEEARLE presenited a petition fron the European and native merchants of Singapore, remonstrating against the introduction by the Government of Inria of the rupee as tiie clurency of that settlement, insteacl of the Spanish dollar, wlhich had been lonig established, and was found convenient alnd satisfactory. He stated that the old ciu-rency of Singapore wvas a decimal one, but that of the rupee was difficult to reckon, and had ;produced the gre,atest intricacy anid confusion. The Government, by paying its officers in rupees, inficted on them a serious loss, as that coin was nlwvays at a discolunt; he hoped the act wvould be repealed. Earl GR SxvILLE admitted that the home Government had doubted the exoediency of the measure, andl instructions had been given that its effects should be closely watchel. Tihe LoR.D CIIAxCELLOr, in moving the second xeadin- of the Church Discipline Bill, described the mixed powers and functions of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and stated that the present bill referred exclusively to their ecclesiastical jurisclictioni. AX act rulating to the Law of Divorce had .nready been introduced in that House; another bill affectin- the power of the Ecclesiastical Courts over wills had becn brough,Iit into the House of Conmunons, because it involved many claims to compensation. The old fonn of process before the Ecclesiastical Courts wnas so cumbrous, dilatoiy, and expensive that some change was necessary. He detailed the reforms attempted bv the act of 1840, and the Bishop of Lo_Nno?'s bill of 1847, which still retained too mtch of an ecclesiastical character. The present bill proposed that assessors (barristers), shotuld sit with and act for the bishop; that four of these chancellors or assessors be appointed, superseding all vicars-general throughout the country; the assessors to be appointed by tw-o Itish bishops, two English bishops, aind the Bishop of LONDO?N; before exercising any of their powers they are to subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles. The jurisdiction of the Bishops' Court extends to offences committed by clerks in holy orders and the proceedings necessary to enforce a due administration of the sacraments and the rites and ceremonies of the Church. All proceedings under the act are to be commenced within two years of the offence. There is an appeal from the Diocesan Court to the Prov-incial Court, and from the Provincial Court to the Judicial Conmuittee of the Privy Council. The Archbishop of CANTEIBiurY opposed the bill, rand moved that it be read a second time that day six montls. The Bishop of DERRY approved the measure, though some of the details might require modificatioIl to render it more acceptable to the English bishops. He read a document in support of the bill, signed by the Archbishops and Bishops of the proviuces of Arniagh and Dublin. The Bishop of Ex.ETEm strongly condemned the bill. The 1ath clause destroyed the authority of the bishop of the diocess, and vested it at the pleasure of the Archbislhop. If the Irish bishops approved that claulse-if they did not feel the sanctity and divine rig,ht of the diocesan episcopacy-they thereby separated themselves from the Church of England. He hoped the House vwould refuse to go into committee on the bill. He mninutely criticized the details of the measure, and denounced them as ill-considered and miscalculated, involving a large expenditure for inadequate objects, derogatory to the bishops and degrading to the Church, which it would deprive of every power of independent ction. The Bishop of BANxGOR spoke against the bill. The Earl of H.:noWNBV denied that the bill gave any new authority to the Archbishop. The other objections to the measture of last year, he contended, had been removed. The Bishop of OxrORD and tlhe Earl of DERBY addressed the House in opposition to the bill. The Bishop of CAsi;R supported it. Their Lordships then divided. There appeared ior the second reading- Contents... ... ... ... o3 Non-contents ... ... ... 41 Majority against the second reading -8 The billis consequently thrown out. SThe House then adjourned until Thursday. In the House of Commons, several questions were addressed to the Government which had reference to the preparations for celebrating the conclusion of peace, and those questions assumed the form of a debate -hen the CAaN?cTon of the ExCuEQUER maoved that the House at its rising do adjour-n until huuday vextt Tlle reply oui the part of several members of ti,, Government amounted to this-that they had been guied by precedent; that there was* no innovation in Maning Preparations before the tesms of the peace were known; that the cost of the fireworks, the exhibition of which would not be confined to the west-end of the town, would not exceed 8,0001., and that they did not think it necessary to submit to the House previously a formal estimate for this outlay. Bfr. MAIrxs called. attention to the charge made by the Clerk of the Ordnance against Iessrs. GnissELL, of having inserted pieces of iron in the mortas made by them, in order that the flaws in [the material they had used might escape observa- tion. This charge, which, he said, was without the slightest foundation, affected not only personal character, but involved the principle uapon which parties contracting with the Government were [to be treated. fle gave an exposition of the facts and of the effect produced by the announcement of the charge in this and the other House of Parliament-a charge implying fraud, which, after Mlessrs. GRISSELL had been held up to the contempt and opprobriiun of the country, was, he contended, ultimately abandoned. Hecharged both Lord PAR- nmuR and Mfr. MoiNsEv, with a want of caution and fairness in making a charge which ought not to have been made. Mlr. Mo.-sx said he should be glad if he could conscientiously arrive at the same conclusion as AMr. DIALIxs ; but he felt he was perfectly justified in the statement he had made by the information he received from competent authorities. He referred briefly to some of the particulars of the case contained in the papers laid before the House in support of the statement. Mr. G. DUNDAS was convinced that the charges were altogether unfounded. Lord LOVAyxE, on the other hand, thought it impossible not to pass judgment upontlie contractors to this extent,-that, a damage having been shown to them, they had not acted with honesty and honour. Colonel BoLo.ERo acquitted Messrs. GrIss=i of fraud, but considered that they had been guilty of gross negligence. Mr. EVELYN, MIr Alderman CUBIrx, and Sir J. PAKINWGTo_N bore testimony to the high character of the firm, and upon the documentary evidence acquitted them of any intentional fraud or dishonesty. M;Ir. TITE stated reasons which, in his opinion, -would account for the accident to the mortars. The motion for the adjournment was then agreed to. On the question that the House do resolve itself into a Committee of Supply, Sir F. BARrNG pointed out what he conceived to be imperfections in the revenue accounts, respecting which ir. WILsoN gave explanations. The House then went into a Committee of Supply upon the remaining Civil Service Estimates, the first of wvhicli, G0,0001., for the salaries and expenses of the British Museum establishment, was moved by Lord J. RUSSELL, who, on the part of the trustees, madle the customary statement of the transactions connected with the Museum during the past year. Mr. MIYNES called attention to the system of management and patronage in that establishment, especially with reference to the report of 1850, vwhich had recominended, among other things, that there should be a body, consisting of a few persons, responsible for the government of the MIuseum. This recommendation, as well as the suogestion of the commissioners in .espect to the patronage, had not been adopted, and lie urged the Govemnment to give eflect to them by a bill. He regarded the selection of a foreigner (Mr. Px.isszzi) to be head librariani of the Museum, instead of a distinguished literary man of our own country, as an evidence that the government of the establishment was not satisfactorily admiinistered. The SPEAXE31 (not being then in the chair), said lie would not discuss what should be the future governnient of the Miuseunm; but he felt it his duty to state by wliat considerations the principal trustees had been guided in selecting Mr. PANIZxI to fill the otfice of clief librarian. Hewas readyto takehis share of the responsibilityof that selection, and he believed it was not possible to make a better. It was by no means so unusual a thing to appoint a foreigner; of five Principal Librarians, two had been foreigners. MIr. P_nizzi, who was the next officer, possessed, besides his claim on that ground, great talents and essential qualifications for the headship, testimonies to which the right hon. gentleman read. As to the patronage of the Museum, he and his colleagues would have no objection to be relieved from the burden of it. MIr. LAYARiD defended the appointment of MIr. PANizzi, but insisted that some reform was required in the govermient of the Miuseuim. Lord ELcHo suggested whether it would not be desirable to consider the propriety of separating the different collections and sending the artistic and arcbleological portions to the new National Gallery. After a few remarks by MaIr. TITE, The CHAN2CELLOR of the ExcHEQr;-Er. explaiiied how far certain recommendations of the commissioners had been adopted, and the reasons for the non-adoption of others; and he answered inquiries made by preceding speakers. M3:r. DisRnixm said, no satisfactory solution of the difiicu1ltv met witlh in the Muiseum could be found except by the division of the great subjects, literature, science, and art, the present building being not too large for the first. He defended 3r. PANIZZi against what he designated as a personal attack ulpoII him by 31r. MrES, who had not, however, he observed, alleged a single objection to his selection except that lie was a foreigner. In his (M:. DSRaABLI's) opinion if the trustees had not appointed 1Mr. Pt_NIZZI to the post, they would have acted with great injustice and offered discouragenient to meritorious public servants. The discussioni then fell into the laxity usual in committees ; in the course of it, Lord J. RUSSELL replied to observations and objections. With reference to the appointment of Mr. PAN2;IzZI, he expressed surprise that Mr. MILN1Es should have shovn so little liberality as to consider a persont, whose talents he had admitted, disqualified for this post because he was born out of England. Mir. 3M1iNxrs reiterated his opinion, that this particular office should have been conferred uipon a distinguislhed literary Englishman. The vote was then agreed to, as well as a vote of 18,6261. for the Board of Health, after a long discussion. The Chairman was then ordered to report progress. The report of tlle Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to. The CHANCELLOR of the ExcHEQuJi, in moving the second reading of the Fire Insurance Bill, stated that its object was to remedy a defect in the existing la), by which the duty was charged only when the insurance was effected in this country. It provided tha.t insurances on property here should pay the duty whether the policy 1ere issued here or in another country. P,r. WraIxBsox consideredl this to be an unwise measure; that it w-ould not effect the object in viewv, wvhile it would crive business from this country. The better course would be to reduce the duty. He moved to defer the second reading for six montlhs. -Mr. E. DmEsisox believed that the bill would be inoperative, except that it might produce the effects predicted by Mr. WIriKIISON. Thle CHANCELLOR of the ExcHEQtER said, the reduction of the duty to Is. would cause a sacrifice of revenue of between 600,0001. and 700,0001. a-year, and he did not think the burden of the tax was severely felt. Mr. HEmmz,y remarked that the CnAxcsTos of the Ex;cHEQuEn had not shown that the bill would save the revenue. He thought it would prove mere waste paper, and that the revenue would gradually slip away. ALr. KilNAnlD moved the adjournmient of the debate. A discussion of some length ensued, in the course of which Mr. TrTE called attention to the effect of the average clause in foreign policies, and ultimately the debate was adjourned until Friday. The other orders were gone through, and, the remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at a-quarter before 2 o'clock until Thursday.
The Emperor AE=NlDER has pronounced at Moscovw a speech deeply interesting. It is the complement to the manifesto lately issued at SSt. Petersburg; it explains the views and confirms tlle promise put forth in that remanrkable documexit. We we bound i' say that, judging from the speech aa it ha reached , the FMPR.oR's words in the ancient capital of Russ{si where national pride and religious fervour are supposed especially to reign, are moderate, dignified, and becoming. He announced to his hearell: that tho war was over, and that he had ratifibl the Treaty of Peace before leaving St. Petersb2u-w It is possible that these words fell on unwD;n ears, and were received with a silence in which re,.P'ct had a greater place than enthusiasm. The nObility, the clergy, the peasantry of MIoscow were far from either seat of war, and, though the burdens of the last two years cannot have been unfelt by them, they have neither beheld their lands wasted by the necessities of a vast army, nor had to dread the vsits of an invading force. We may conceive, then, that national pride is more exalted in the old capital than in St. Petersburg or Nicholaieff. The EsIPERor. speaks almost in a tone of apology, yet with firmness and openly. Russia was able to defend herself for many years longer, and was invulnerable on her own territory. No fear for the future, therefore, he says, induced him to listen to the Austrian proposals; but he made peace partly because war is an abnormal state of which the benefits can never counterbalance the evils, and partly because Russian commerce was suffering from a conflict in which no object was to be gained. Then follows a remarkable admission, which embodies all that WVestern politicians have said or written on the war :-" I should "have carried on hostilities had not the voice of "neighbouring States pronounced itself against "the policy of late years." This is, indeed, the case, and the universal desertion of the Russian cause by her old allies was, no doubt, the main reason for the altered tone and lowered pretensions of the EmI'PEOR's Cabinet. When Austria became hostile; when Prussia, though a friend, took all a friend's liberties of earnest and passionate remonstrance; when Sweden entered into new relations, and threw off the vassalage of a century; when among the small States of Germany there was something like an approach to a new Confederation of the Rhine, then it was time for the boldest autocrat to pause, and consider whether the system which had been built up with so much care did not really want a foiundation in human interests and human sympathies. The Emperor ALE2XA"mE expresses, as is natural, I much respect for his father's memory and intentions, and somewhat more conventionally declares his adherence to the old policy of the empire. But in every sentence he reflects with unconscious severity on all for wlhich NicnorAs was distLnguished. The plans of the late Emperor entitled him to be called, though in no praiseworthy sense, a NAromEox of Peace. His object was aggression, the more dangerous to other States because it was concealed and gradual. He had all the ambition of a great conqueror, but seemed to be convinced, that in modern Europe conquest by an armed inroad was impossible. The great Captain of France had fallen,-he would be warned by his catastrophe, and adopt a different course. He therefore, from his accession to his death, never entered willingly into any great war. His whole policy was directeed to the gradual disintegration of the States nearest to him, and when, as in 1828 and 1849, he saw an empire divided and paralyzed, |he would interfere for or against, as was most conducive to hi' own power. To be always ready for this kind of aggression was his great military aim. To have on every frontier a numerous army equipped for an immediate march was necessary to overawe his neighbours. But he determined never, if possible, to go to war with great military Powers, nor did it enter inlto his thoughts that the progress of science and the enthusiasm of the WVest would ever send to his owvn shores the armies of a new crusade. Hence, with tlhree-foiuths of a million of men under arms and two vast naval fortresses protecting two powerful fleets, Russia has never had the true means of supporting war. Railways, canals, even good roads, have never existed. No preparations have ever been made for a long war; it has never been calculated that Russia might be Cut off from the rest of Europe, that half the community of nations might be in arms against her, and the other half trembling on the verge of a ruptuire. A besieging aimy at Sebastopol, an invading force in Georgia, a blockade in the Baltic, Constantinople a, hostile harbour, occupied by an irresistible fleet, were eventualities which he never contemplated, and wvhich were, in reality, so strange, that not to have foreseen them may be pardoned even to the wisest statesman. But the laws of politics, as of nature, are relentless; and, though NIcHoLAs might well deem his plans wise and farsighlted, the piuishment of his error has not been the less complete. His successor speaks to MIoscow and the world in a tone of strange humiliation. " I am sure," says he to his subjects, " that allo-wances will be made for the " difficult position in which I was placed, and that " every friend of Russia wVill render justice to my views and intentions for the welfare of the coun"try." " Supposing," lie adds, "that the war " should have remained favourable to us, as it has "been in Asia, yet the empire would have exhausted "itself in keeping up armies on different points, "the soldiers of which would have been taken "away from agriculture and ?abour." Such are the words in which the Muscovite ruler confesses the collapse of the system of which PETER, CATHEraNu, and NICiOLAS were proud. Yet, after forty years of military display, after the construction of fortifications to be measured by miles, wherever there was a frontier, a harbour, or a delta in the empire, after guns by the thousand had been stored in the arsenals of the two seas, after the whole genius, energy, and ambition of so many races had been devoted almost exclusively to the one pursuit of war, the master of all these resources is compelled to tell his subjects, after two years' trial, that, though they may condemn hiim. though they may despise him, yet common care for the safety of Russia forced him to snatch at offers of peace, and to meditate the total abandonment of his ancestors' plans. What indemnity, what territorial gain, could be a greater triumph to the Western Powers than this acknowledgmeat How can the future safety of Europe re- ceive a surer guarantee than is derived from the humbled tone of the man who alone has the power to threaten it ? Indeed, it was time for Russia to recede from the contest which she had provoked. 'What her state is we hear from the unwilling lips of her ruler. WYhat the resources of the Western Powers, and especially of England, are we are only beginning to learn. Russian trade has been ruined, Russian provinces have been depopulated, Russian arsenals have been exhausted, just when the ener- cgies of this ountry are being fully roused, and its wealtl and resources ascertained by triaL In a few hours there will be assembled at Portsmouth a fleet such as the world has never seen before, manned by seamen which an enormous commerce furnishes in unfailing numbers. All the newest discoveries of science combine to. give efficiency to each of these powerful vessels, the possession of any half-dozen of which would entitle a State to consider itself somewhat of a naval Power. The pageant which will be witnessed is in celebration of peace, and it is a fitting spectacle to illustrate the greatness of our triumph and the solidity of our strength. The fleet which will manceuvre j-efore the eyes of thousands would, but for the conmessions of Russia, be Bow on its w ay to tag north, ready to assa the stronghold and dSpIti of the CZAR with almost irresistible power. GCal any doubt remain of the relative strength of the two nations? And if the little islarnd can so far outdo the extended empire, which numbers twice its population, can there be any one who fails to recognize the principle of such a superiority?e Industry, liberty, private energy, the arts of peace have given England the strength to fight barbarism with its own arms. Warlike systems have fallen exhatisted in the hour of trial, while those who have never desired or studie.l war are beat prepared for it within a short period at its outbreak. The lesson has not been lost on the CzAR. Elis speech a;t Moscow is said to hav-o developed plans for railways, roads, river navigation, and Custom-house reforms. We are told that already the frontier traffic is open and vessels are arriving at Russian ports. The old protective and isolating system of the late CzAR we cannot doubt is doomed. If Russia, under her present ruler, adopt a more liberal code, and forget her ancient ambition, we have little doubt that her people will one day confess that the disasters lately suffered have been the teachings of a wholesome adversity.
At the invitation of Mr. M. MrILN-Es, the House of Commons last night spent several hours on the British Museum. There is no reason why it should not do so two or tlhree times every year, except that every member has seen the report of the last Commission on the Museum, with its evidence, and has formed an idea that it would cost him a twelvemonth's study to qualify him to open his mouth on the subject. Mr. ML. MmIES, having gone through that ordeal, has entered upon the government of the Mulseuim, the appointment of MIr. PAmzzi, the predominance of literature over science, and some other out of the thousand topics suggested. There is only too much to say about them. The grievances of the readers are indeed now in process of amendment, and whoever wishes to peruse at the public expense one of the first printed book-s or one of DiCxmis's later novels will soon be able to do so under a dome larger than St. Paul's and more ingenious and graceful than the Pantheon. With that exception, it is hard to say what has been effected by the laboiur of the gentlemen who compiled tnat mnonster report, for which MEnOow is the proper reader and AsExRNmDE's sarcophagus the only fitting receptacle. The Museum is still half-adozen MIuseiuns,-three, at least, in one. It stiU contains the elements of perpetual discord, for when was it found that a purely literary man had patience with stuffed beasts and birds, or a comparative anatomist with Oriental MSS., or an antiquary with butterflies or nineralogical specimens? There is still everywhere the evident want of a man with sufficient authority in. his own department to make the best of it. We suspect, indeed, that there are at least two or three gentlemen in the British MIuseum of European fame, and, what is more, very good fellows, who would be delighted to hear that the whole of the collection, except their own particular department, had been consumed by fire or swept away by a hurricane-as much so as a schoolboy to hear of the ihe catastrophe happening to the school-room or his master's house. As the building is one of the most inelastic designs ever imagined by man, and is utterly incapable of enlargement without loss of symmetery, it is evident that the several collections and their respective managers and patrons must wage an internecine war till some one triumvir has ousted the rest. To all appearance, before the end of another century the CmsAit of Great Russell-street who will triumph over the liberties of science, and establish a despotic umity in the place of that novw multifarious mass, will be the third or foiurth successor of PAmaZZI, some German, or perhaps Russian, who has proved his light to the throne of literature by repeating meino)riter the iTics of all the books in the library, by that time several millions. of all actuLal or imaginary competitors, we have no hesitation in admitting that M1Ir. PAxIzZI was the man for his present place, and lr. BM. MITNEs has spoilt his own argument, besides offending against liberality and taste, by objecting to that gentleman's foreign extraction. WVith this exception there is a great deal of truth in DIr. M. MmxEs's speech. It certainly is utterly unaccountable that the House of Conunons has wholly passed by the reconnendations of the Commissioners, on no other ground apparcntly than t'hat Sir R. Pr= treated them as he did everything not proceeding fiom the House itself. Though a species of standing connuittee has superseded with advantage the mob of trustees that used to a^t, or not, as they pleased, and therefore acted often from factious or personal feelings, still taere is the wMant of a select body of trustees, a sort o" executivecouncil, giving their wlhole tine to a chlarge of iunsurpassed difficulty and importance. L is reasonable to suppose fhat if the Museum were managed by a few men able to give it their undivided attention, they vouild be keenly alive to every symptom of flagging interest on the part of tlae public; that they w ould be always labouring ta incerease the attraction and acconunodation of the MIuseum; and that they 'would be ever anticipating the feelings of the visitor, the reader, the artist, and all the classes for wlhose benefit or simple recreation it is intended. We believe that the Ml-useum is not visited, is not used, is not resorted to, as it ought to be. As for the visitors, it is notorious that most Londoners go to the Mluseum about once in their lives, as they go once to Westminster Abbey and the Thames Tunnel. That one day is abouit the hardest day's -work in their lives; for it is an attempt to take in a hundred thousand new images and ideas, on every variety of subject, in three or fotur hours. The labour, of course, is needlessly aggravated by that economy, or simplicity, which has crowded together the whole compass of htuman knowledge into one heavy quadrangular pile. WVe are sure that if the managers of the lMIuseum would onlybe at the trouble to ascertain the feelings of the visitors as they pour out of the ample portico at a quarter to 4, they would gladly enter into almost any project for dividing the collection, and rendering a visit to it a rather less drain on the mental and animal powers. To all appearance, thle completion of the Bluseum has immediately led to a decline of interest. This, of course, may arise from what we have already mentioned-that, like the French gentleman who deElined the offer of a day with the hounds because "he had hunted," people in general seem to find in one visit ample satisfaction. But it ought not to be so, and we will venture to say it would not, if the managers, like the directors of the Crystal Palace Company, had a direct interest in making the Museum popular. Certainly there are faults inherent in the buil-ding which it may not be easy now to repair. For example, when you enter the Gallery of Sculpture a thousand objects instaintly invade and press on the eye, distracting the attention, and giving an overwhelming idea of the work to be done. This impression is made still niore painful and oppressive by the sight of the listless, jaded crowd, roaming among the sculptares, looking in vain for something to catch and arrest in attention which they have no longer the power to concentrate and fix. Were this vast gallery divided more into saloons or courts, and were the arrangement sich. as to make the eye re*t on a few object5 haying a certaii relatioa to one another, we are coifdent the visitors would owerve and remember more, while the general e,ffet would not be so distracting. The whole arra-ngement above and below evidently supposes a vast, endles procession, pasing on and on continiil1Y the- live long day, never stopping, never .'esting, never reflecting, but only hastening to disch&Tge a solenm3. duty, and see through the Museum. The defects of arrangement, and the want of objects of an historical or artistic interest less than eighteen c;^nturies old, are, perhaps, the chief reasons why that vast collection, aided by so great an expenditure, fa;2s to attract as it ought to do. True, it has a formidable rival in the Crystal Palace; but a gratuitous exhibition in the heart of Londeln ought not to be beaten by a spectacle to be paid for eight miles off. There must be some fault in the management, and that management requires more exclusive devotion than the present trustees can give to it.
A display of fireworks took place Jast nig,ht in the House of Commons on the subject of the pyrotechnic display which is to be exhibite& one of these days in honour of the Peace. The general feeling of the speakers appeared to ram against the proposed exhibition, either because they judged. that we had better defer our rejoicing until the terms of the Peace are known, or because they disapproved the Peace altogether. :Mr. ROEBUCE. had quite a tiff with Mr. MoKSELa upon the point. He demanded by whose authority these expenses had been incurred. The Opposition cheered hin, on, and seemed disposed to make a serious matter of this idle argument. What had been done had been done by the authority of the Secretary of State. What Secretary of State? The SrEcPETnY of STATE for WAR. What right had the SEcRBTAny of STATE for WAR to act without the assent of the CHAXCELLOR of the EXCHEQuER? The CH"ozELoi of the ExcHEQuER had given his assent. WVhen Mr. RoMEUCK had been shaLen off, Lord Jo-N MAia',imts rose to beg for delay. Don't let us set fire to the rockets until the ratifications are exchanged and we know what terms we have really obtained. MIr. BRnY intimated that, if we are to have fireworks in London, it would be only reasonable that the citizens of Dublin should be indulged with a similar spectacle. Colonel Mxox was exceedingly jealous for the honour of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE. It appears that the wooden houses in the Parks, which have given so much offence, have been erected -without the consent of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE, who is Ranger of the Parks. It is needless to say that the oniission was altogether unintentional, that the Duke of CASmImctm's consent was a matter of course, that the most ample apologies have been offered and received, and that the Ranger is thoroughly appeased, if, indeed, he had ever troubled himself to give two thoughts to the matter. Colonel K-ox, however, holds out. The Duke of CAArnmRiG may, but he cannot, overlook the offence. Thus we have exhausted the catalogue of objections, -with the exception of those which regard the expense and the account to which it is to be referred. The cost is to be S,000.,-a handsome sum, no doubt, if an individual were concerned, but really the Eniglish nation can afford to spend 8,0001. in fireworks once or twice in a century, independently of all questions of peace or war. We know how many excelIent things might be said in favour of expending this sum upon flannel waistcoats for aged men afflicted with the rheumatism, or upon the foundation of ragged schools, or upon the equestrian stathes of eight aldermeu; but surely we may be allowed to indulge in a little amusement now and then. What a vast number of people will be amused by this display ! Think only of the children, without taklig into account those among their elders who have not yet lost all the fire of their youth and all their power of enjoyment under the laborious routine of English life ! There are many thousands of personsin London-many hundredsofthousands, we may well say-to whom this display will form an event in their lives, and who will be pleased to speak of the spectacle in years to come, when the disagreeable recollections connected with the Russian war are forgotten. The main question, however, is as to the occasion upon which the display is to take place. No doubt, many of the members who uttered their objections last night would not have been unwilling to sanction the expenditure of 8,0001. uipon a public rejoicing of anothler kdnd. We may suggest one or two considerations which may induce them to modify their opinions. In the first place, we have a right to be proud. What men could do has been done by our brave soldiers and sailors. Despite the elemeents, and despite their own commanders, they have conquered in all instances, save one. The chronicles of the Alma and Ihkermann are there to show that the share of the British soldier has been no inglorious one in the recent struggle. Far above even their ungaided heroism in the battle-field do we place those months of -gonizing endurance, when each British soldier in the trenches before Sebastopol did the work of six men, and did it well, though itarved in the neighbourhood of plenty and unclothed in the midst of stores filled with what he most required. We say, let England rejoice with heart and soul that she can yet send forth aimed bands from among her sons who are capable of the heroic deeds which have been performed in the Crimea by the English soldier, with small assistance from his chiefs. If any othex cause for rejoicinog be wanting let any man who still hesitates upon the poiEcy of peace or war walk dorwn to Chelsea Hospital, and take a glance at the men to whose judgment and gguidance the honour of the country and the precious blood of our brave soldiers would have been again intrusted if the war had gone on. We are much mistaken if one kour of this ex.- hibition does not reconcile him to the harmless fireworks of both Pa1rks and of Primrose-hill.

The gsft'ab bulk of the passenger traffic, both of the privi-. leged and the public, for steamers will be enconrm - tered at Portsea, where all the packets of the South- - Eastern, Brignton and Dieppe, and other ports, are ordered to embark at the Albert Pier, which, lying in the interior of the harbour and entirely out of the way of the channel of navigation in the direction of the harbour's mouth, is deemed the least likely to be the cause of any obstruction to the naval traffic. The yachts, smaller vessels, and water. men7s craft will have better facilities at the Victoria Pier, and the Sallyport adjoining. The Grand Stand on the edge esplanade, near Southsea Castle, will realize handsomely for the funds of that public promenade, which is the object of the projectors. From its seats all who invest lOs. wll have an unbroken view of the entire sweep of water from the Nab lightvessel, where the easternmost pivot ships are stationed, down to Cowes, where the westernmost are moored, and the vista down the avenue of masts is one of the most magnificent the gaze can dwell on. The raiwvay companies (South-Western and South-Coast) are making ad. mirable preparations to regulate the easy distributioi of the pressure from -within on arrival down, and the same to facilitate the return up, the two lines having separate places of egress and ingress, instead of the joint one in common. Superintendent Mountain, at Portsmouth, and Stevens,. at Gosport, and those at the principal junctions leading into the great trunlks of those railways, are indefatigable in their direction of the necessary works to be accomplished in their respective provinces. The Royal yachts have been out trying theirmachinery, and all promises well for the eventful morrow. The following circularhas been issued from the Admiralty, prescribingthe measures to be adopted by the respective flag-officers, captains, and comananders at the review:- " On the occasion of Her MLajesty's reviewing the fleet the ships will be anchored at Spithead in two columns at three cables' distance; the ships of the line at LA cables apart; smaller ships at one cable. "The ships of the line will anchor to the eastward, then the screw frigates, screw corvettes, and paddlewheel steamers. The divisions of guboats will continue the line to the 'estward, two divisions in each line, fornied each into two sub-divisional columns (half a cable apart) to the west of its divisional leader. "The Meander, Belleisle, floating batteries, exercising bigs, and the mortar-vessels will anchor and form a stationary line from the Spit Buoy to the western end of Stoke'i'bay_ "The London and Rodney will take up a position as pivot ships to the R.N.E. of the Nab Light, at four cables apart. Tswo other pivot vessels will be similarly placed at one mile west of Cowes. "A Royal salute will be fi-ed by the fleet on Her Ma. jesty's yacht reaching the Spit Buoy, and the same on Her hiajesty's return into harbour after the review ; bat not until the Royal yacht shaU have reached inside the Spit luoy. No other salute is to be fired.* " All the ships while at anchor, are to be dressed in colours, and on the Royal yacht passing each ship is to man the rigging and the crews are ta cheer. The Meander and stationary ships are to man yards and cheer. " If the weather is tolerably fine, and there is not much swell in the offing, the fleet will have steam ready (but with the fires banked) and be hove short by 11 o'clock in the forenoon. "Her Majesty's yacht on leaving Portsmouth harbour w eill probably steam past Gilkicker'oint, and entering hetweenthe columns atthe western, or Cowues end, willproceed throughtheir whole extent. As soon as Her Majesty shall have passed the eastern vessels of the flotilla thc flotilla will weigh,and will followf the Queen's yacht hetween the limes in the same order in which they are anchored, preceded by the officer in conunand of the division, in one of the larger gunvessels. On reaching the flagships, the van and rear squadrons of the flotilla wll tuIU in succession to port, round the Duke of Wellington. The van squadron (White) ill take up a positionat anchor for attacking the MUeander and stationary une, their right, opposite to the floating batteries, near the Spit Buoy, extending to the vuestfard in line. The rear squadron (Blue) will place itself to the eastward of the Boyne Buoy, opposite to Southsea Castle. The centre and light squadron of the flotilla will turn in succession to starboard, round the Royal George, and, passing to the southward of the soutbh column of the line of ships, will cross to the westward of both eolumns. The centre squadron (Red) will take up a position at anchor, their left opposite to the Meander and Belleisle in Stol;es Bay, and extending thence to the eastwvard opposite to the mortar vessels. The light squadron (White, Red) will follow the centre division, and Will place itself in position between the centre and van squadrons. "The whole flotilla will be prepared to open fire on signal from the R!'yal yacht, or Commander-in-Chicf.- " As soon as the flotilla shall have passed the fla hips in the van of the coluumns the whole fleet will weigh on the signal being made by the Commander-in-Chief, lowering their flags simultaneously with the flagship, and will proceed in close order of sailing towards the pivot-ships, at such a rate as will allow the prescribed order to be maintained, closing the columns to a cable's length apart. On reaching the pivot-ships to the EBNU . of the 2Nab each column, after passing between them, mill turn outwards round these ships, the starboard column turning to starbeard, and the port column to port, manning the rigging and cheering the Royal acht as they pas&. They will then return to Spithead in the same order, closiDng their colunmns after the ships returning westward shall have passed the rear of the fleet, and thus regain their anchorage at Spit. head, unless otherwise directedhy signaL.

THE BRITISH ARMY. VAXP BEFORE SEBASTOPO0, TuxsDAX Moj;NIG, APRIL 8. (FROM OU3 SPEIL CORRYSPONDlKT.) nTo following appeared in our second edition of yegO Iccday --I The weather has at last assumed the mildness of xpring, and for the few weeks that the army will have to remain in the Crimea it may be expected that picnics, shooting, fishing, racing, and drill and ball practice will form the principal business of our lives, until everything is prepared for embarcation. Then there will, no doubt, be a great rush, and a great struggle to pack up, to burn and destroy, to getfavouriteponiesonboard ships, orto smuggle away. extra chests and boxes. The traces of our presence will endure for mary a long year, notwithstanding the perishable nature of earthworks, and all the energy of Russia and the physical force at her disposal will be tasked to the uttermost before Sebastopal can rise from the heaps of blackened stones and shattered walls which now nmark its site. In some places our mission of destruction is not complete, and I presume the peaee will prevent any measures being taken to blow up the buildings which line the quay of thd docks on the eastern side; they are considerably injured by fire and by shot, but are not, so far asThan judge, rendered incapable of repair. As for the ciiy proper, with some few isolated exceptions, it might be knocked down with a piclk and carted away as rubbish. The walls, whichlook firm at a distance, are seen on near approach to be mere shells, which a strong man could overthrow. The desolation and silence of the grass-grown streets, the course of which is marked out by heaps of white stone in fragments or inblocks, piled confusedly on each other as they were thrown dovn by the shock of explosion or the actual agency of powder, are appalling. One may wander between these walls of deFbris, which look like ruinous trenches, for bLours without meeting a soul, or hearing even a sparrow chirp. If a stone disturbed by his tread falls clattering among the ruin, the stranger accustomed to the profound noiselessness of this new Palmyra starts as though Sebastopol were in the Great Desert, and untrodden by any but himself. All the roar of the batteries, the smoke, the tumult, the shouting, the tramp of men, the stern life of the trenches, and the labours of the siege have died away, we cannot trust for ever, but let us hope for many a long year to come. Alone unchangeable, the blue sea sparkles in the sunshine between the white forts and the sheerheadlands of the roadstead, and ripples over the sunken fleet, whichjust rears its mastheads above the waters. The harbour is still there, the Dockyard Creek,, the Careening Bay-all ready once more to lend their aid to man in forming a new Sebastopol. The Tchernaya still flows into the deep bay, and can bear on its bosom countless tons of freestone from the quarries of Inkermann, which are to all appearance inexhaustible, and which may well contain a new Sebastopol. Let the rotting skeletons, the heaps of human bones, the debris of ragged uniforms and equipments, the remains of the :fierce struggle which ended in that ravine still scattered over its side, preach a lesson to whoever is about to build the city again.. An engineer officer remarked the other day that he never saw a city which could be so soon reconstructed. The very ruined mansions and the stones of the houses could be used to fill up a small ravine which intersects the city, and to form quays by the waterside. As to the sunken ships there are various opinions. Some say they are by this time utterly ruined, others contend that they can be weighed and rendered fit for service; but for the most part they are only sailing vessels of the old build, short and tubby. I have seen apiece of teak cut out of one of them, which was as perfectly sound and good as it was the first day it was used. The deal of which the submerged gLmcai'iages are made has, however, suffered from the ravages of the worm. All operations against the ships must now be hopeless. The preparations for the departure of the army continue actively, and aIreadyseveral hundreds of the Army Works Corps have been shipped at Balaklava, and have gone on their way homewards. The carriage of provisions to the front has ceased ad cumulandtim, and only a few days' stores are kept at the divisional commissariat yards. The QuartermasterGeneral's department is busily engaged in maldng the necessary arrangements for the shipment of the large quantities of inat6rie belonging to the Engineers, the Artillery, and the Line. There is only one department which must labour to the last, and import stores so long as our army remains here, and that is the Comnmissariat, for the men eat just as much in peace as in war. It is difficult to make calculations when the army becomes a rapidly decreasing quantity, and serious responsibilities devolve on the officer in charge of the department under such circumstances. The French Intendance and our Comnissariat have had to contend with very serious obstacles, and among them there was none greater than the mortality among the cattle purchased by their agents, which in some instances has utterly ruined contractors " for delivery." In nine months the French lost 8,000 bullocks out of 17,500 at Samsoun alone, and we lost at the same place 4,000 out of 10,000 bullocks. But even those who survive do not get very fair treatment on their way to the Crimea. It is horribly true that the unfortunate animals are sometimes hoisted up into the ships and out of them again by their horns, and that some of them in calf have been hoisted out by means of slings of rope ismder t-he belly, and have died in agony on the wharf. The losses in this way, and by the way in which the animals are beaten and crowded together and fed, are disgraceful in every sense, and ought to be revolting to humanity. In some of the ships there are no troughs of water provided for them. Our cruelty recoils on ourselves, for they die of exhaustion and thirst, or are reduced to skin and bone. There is no care taken to feed them in others of those ships, except by throwing wads of hay into the hold. One vessel with a cargo of 100 cattle and 800 sheep from Baltschik landed only 63 cattle and 230 sheep at Balaklava; but it is qluite evident that if we made it the contractor's business to take care of the animals by only making an agreement for delivery alive we should save money and avert much suffering. That it can be done we have proof, for the Sardinians form their contracts on that base as a general rule, and a contractor who sent them 300 sheep from Guemlek took such care to keep them alive by putting turnips, mangoldwurzel, and water on board, that he brought every one of them, with two exceptions, in good condition to Balaklava. SIm1-Av, APRIuL 6. The reserve battalion of the Land Transport Corps, under the command of Major Hutton, was inspected to-day, at 2 o'clock, by Sir William Codrington, on the plains of Balaklava. Colonel 31I'urdo, the Director-General of the Corps, was on the field, directing the movements of the train, whichl covered a large space of ground. General Windham, General della Marmora and staff, and a few foreign officers, were also present, and seemed to take a great interest in the equipment of the battalion, which was in excellent order, and turned out 110 carts ready for the march, with spare wheels, forge-waggon, and every requisite for their proper service in a campaign. The drivers have succeeded in obtaining the confidence of the mules to a considerable extent, and get on better 'with those sagacious but self-willed animals than they used to do, and perhaps the mules, having succeeded in proving to demonstration that whacks on the head don't affect them in -he least, and that- punche3 in the ribs and. blown only insure the defeat of those who beito'rthem, have also brought- round their '7i-asters to try the effect of kindness and good treatment.

There is no doubt but that the old soldiers and the officers who have joined from regiments which have served throughout this siege *will soon infuse a true military spirit into this corps, notwithstanding the heterogeneous materiala of which some portion of it was inevitably composed when men were enlisted for it in all haste. A-s it is, the efforts of their officers have effected wonders, and the men presented a smart, clean, and soldierlike appearance in aine, which gave great satisfaction to the General-in-Chief, and refleeted the highest credit on those through whose exertions such a change has been effected. MIany of the. carts were new and looked very neat, but it must be recolleeted that they are open to the objections I have stated in previous letters, and that neither in material nor details of construction are many of them fit for the service or worthy of our reputation as a mechanical people. I believe so-me of the bent, twisted, and rotten axles have been sent home to England for the inspection of the authorities, to satisfy theni that the complaints on this subject are well founded. In addition to the ordinary duties of the Iand Transport Corps in carrying up provisions and stores from BalaIdava to the various camps, there will now be the trying work of conveying from Sebastopol all the shot and shell within the English portion of the town. As to collecting and removing these missiles, which are sown broadcast in the very soil like pebbles on a beach for the space of seven miles in length and two miles in breadth, the task is hopeless of execuition. Piles of shot have been formed in every ravine, and stand there as monuments of the uselessness of such efforts as have yet been made to gather the iron shower which fell for 11 long months in front of Sebastopol. Every watercourse is full of iron-shell, shot, and spinters of strange shapes abound in every ravine. The Russians will only have to collect what the alles leave behind them to form large magazines of shot, but shell will not be so plentiful, as they were more sparingly used, and were generally damaged, if they did not burst. Guns, too, are buried in the earth, and peer out from the earthwork of overthrown batteries. It was only yesterday I passed some five or six fine English cannon, apparently 32-pounders, which had been flung dowln the side of the ravine from the French battery overlooking the Dockyard Creek, and were lying upside down in the ground. The Artillery are daily engaged in slinging guns and mortars, and sending them down to Balaklava for shipment. It is calculated that the Russians fired about 30,000 tons of iron at us. It is certain that we gave them about 11,000 tons in return, and possibly the French fired about 20,000 tons; so that between 60,000 and 70,000 tons weight of iron must be lying about on the plateau. The great objects of attraction to-day were the Russians, who crowvded over the Tchernaya, and wandered into every part of our camps, where they soon made out the canteens. By 1 o'clock there were a good many of them " as soldiers wish to be who love their . grog." A navvy of the most ,tolid kind, much bemused with beer, is a jolly, [ively, and intelligent being compared to an intoxiated "Ruski." They are the image of the men in Noah's ark-I mean that popular article constructed it Nuremberg for Young oEurope-stiff and angular, nd when they fall down it is done with a jerk and m rigidity worthy of Richardson's. Their drunken salute to passing officers is very ludicrous, mud one could laugh only he is disgusted it the abject cringe with which they remove ;heir caps, and bow, bareheaded, with horrid "ravity intheirbleary leaden eyes and wooden faces, it the sight of a piece of gold lace. Some of them seemed very much annoyed at the behaviour of their comrades, and endeavoured, to drag them off Erom the canteens, and others remained perfectly 3ober. Our soldiers ran after them in crowds, and ~raternized very willingly with their late enemies; but the Russian officers seemed to hold with the French rather than with ourselves. Towards evening thebanksof theTchernaya presentedacurious appearance at the fords. The boon companions, French and English, were shaking hands and bidding most affeetionate farewells to their Ruski comrades, who had to cross over before the rappel. In places this was aasier said than done, for the only mode of crossing was on balks of timber, which looked double to their vision, but in reality were narrow enough for sober man to find some difficuilty in crossing; so ever and anon the Ruski tumbled off amid Shouts of laughter, and. -was pulled out half drowned. A grim guard, with fixed bayonets, envious probably of the happy condition of their comrades, was waiting for them at the other side and the bank was patrolled by Cossacks, with ropes, all ready to tie up any "incapable"and take him homewards. Down they came, staggering and roaring through the bones of their countrymen (which in common decency I hope they will bury as soon as possible), and then, after elaborate leavetaking, passed the fatal stream. General Codrington was down at the ford, and did not seem to know whether to be amused or scandalized at the scene, but I have no doubt he will take steps to prevent any such exhibition on the part of our men. The navvies have found their way across to the caves, and some of them have established such friendly relat,ions with the Russians that they have been allowed to see the chapel cut out of the rock, which they describe in terms of great praise; " It's aal gould and coot glass." Some Russian engineers have gone over the allied works. They will learn little from them. The French have filled up all their trenches in front of the Malakhoff. Our men are removing the wood -and gabions from the bat teries and the Redan, and these now constitute our principal articles of fuel. They are placed in the divisional Commissariat stores, whence they are served out to the regiments. Mf[ONDAY, APRIL 7. The number of Russians about our camp to-day was, so far as I could judge, not so great as it was yesterday; but those who did come over to visit their friends were very soon rendered incapable of returning home, and were staggering abont in every direction but the right one, if they were sober enough to keep on their legs at all, or were lying about in the neighbourhood of the bazaars in utter helplessness and obliviousness. Many of these in;toxicated heroes wear two ribands and orders.; sometimes one sees a private with as many as three or four decorations, but that is rare. An officer, aidlede-camp to the General who commands the corps at Mackenzie, in riding about the camp, found himself close to the Brigade of Guards, who were out on one of the ordinary brigade field-days, and he drew up and watched the drill for some time. Lord Rokeby -went up and addressed him, and the Russian was soon on the best terms with his new acquaintance. The Russians frequently visit Sebastopol,. and wander about amid the ruins, as if to see what is left, or to discover, if possible, their old haunts. They come into Balaklava occasionally, and wander through its streets in a state of perplexity, or seek to -identify-the siter of- their -departed mansions.- -Several of the Greeks hire also paid the toiy a. -viWt, and ire - tery- much puzzled -'to find out whereo they lived two years ago. One man "id, {'I had three very good houses in this -town, but I 'really cannot now tell even the place where onoe they stood." Colonel Hardinge, the Commandant, very- propeily kept all the. drunken Ruskied out of the. town last night, and -placed sentries on the nrrovr' road between the cliff and the water3s of the harbour, to prevent them coming in after theirjolhificationsat the bazaar of Kadikoi. The storelkeepers find good customers among the Russian officers for sugar, tea, champagne, and spirita, aUl of which are enormously dear in their own camps. Sugar is not to be had for -any money, even in Simpheropol and Bakghiserai. Champagne, of which .they are very fond, is 15f. a bottle, and tea is 20f. a-pound; on the other side of the Tchernaya. At this side the price of these articles is less than one-half of those amounts; so that there is ample inducement for a Russian officer to come down from Mfackenzie with his orderly and a sumpter pony to lay in a store of such luxuries. There is danger to the discipline .of all the armies -if the intercourse between the soldiers is not restricted, but a Muscovite General wouIld have far more to fear from the- results produced on his men by an inspection of our camps than the allies would have to dread from allowing their troops to draw comparisons between themselves and the Russians. If the suttlers come in from the interior with their usual attendants, there is more reason to be apprehensive for our men. The change of wind has relieved us from a more positive apprehension, and that was that we should be left without barley. There was not more than a few days' supply for our horses in the - Crimea, when the wind changed, and permitted one of the fleet of sailing vessels which is laden with forage to enter Balakdava, after knocking about in the Black Sea for a fortnight. Sheep are becoming scarce. We have cleared out Roumelia altogether, but, just in the nick of time, a supply of fine oxen is pronised from the plains on the south side of the Danube. This army has a fine appetite; it manages to consume 250,0001b. of barley, 250,0001b. of hay, and 90,0001b. of bread pei diemn, and to eat uD about 3,000 bullocks and 15,000 or 18,000 sheep per month, beside little pickings of potted meats, preserved vegetables, private stores, poultry, geese, turkeys, and game, washed down with fiood3 of wine and spirits and an ocean of rum. Well, it i thrives on its food, and looks fat and hearty andJfull I of fight upon its diet. It is very well for the enemy that there is no occasion for the displayof its powers. Not only are the men well fed, well drilled, and well taken care of externally and internally, but :the people at home are providing for their mental instruction and recreation. I have been, requested to acknowledge the receipt of the following articles by the Acting Principal Chaplain, the Rev. H. W. 1. Egan :-14 cases of books from Air. Albert Smith; two cases of books from Miss Catherine Sinclair; one case of books from mr. Darling, Great Queen-street; two cases of books from Mr. MAndrew, Dublin; one . box of books from Miss Lyons, 4, Lowndes-square; three large boxes of books from Lady Rolle; one large box of books and i games from Th-e Times; seven cases of tracts on temperance from the Temperance Society, and sundry cases and parcels from anonymouis friends. Most ofI the books are very well adapted to amuse and im- | prove the soldier, but some of the boxes contained tracts of the fiercest controversial character on re- ligious matters, only suited to create ill-blood ! between comrades, and to infuse the odiuem theolojgicutn into the rum and water, which I fearj the tracts of the Temperance Society will not! render a bit less popular in the camp huts. These have been withheld from distribution, andc can be had back by those who were so good as to send them. A number of torn and coverless Bibles can also be returned, as they were quite unfit. for use. So the young ladies who were considerate enough to fill a case with interesting manuscript, exercises in Italian are informed that the sentiments expressed therein have received the very warm approval of those few who saw their pleasing compositions, but that it was not thought necessary to send their little exercitations to the libraries,l as it was imagined that the men would be ratherI lost among the angular pothooks and hangers in which the Tuscan of these fair moralists is greatly involved. TUESDAY, 10 A.M. The fine weather continues.. The passes for the Russian lines have not yet arrived. No one talks of anything else-not even of the grand French races, which come off on the 10th, and to which the Emperor has sent 1001., and Marshal Pelissier has contributed 501. M. Talon, the winner of the steeplechase on the Tchernaya, has a match for a large sum of money to ride his horse, Paddy Boy, i against Muster Roll, and the race excites great in- I terest and a lttle national rivalry. The mail is, of course, not in yet; in fact, it is regularly (irregularly) four or five days late, and the service by the French boats is very badly performed.
TURKEY. _0 (JI}OX OUR OWNV CORlXUSEOXNDET.) .The following appeared in our second edition of yes. terday:-] CON, sTANSTDUM, APRIL iU. The review of the British troops at Scutarl by the Sultan on Monday last was very successful. Long projected andc several times postponed on account of the bad weather, it was only definitively fixed upon on the afternoon of the preceding Sunday. The choice of a convenient spot was no small difficulty. The country about Scutari being a clay formation, without being mountainous, is very much cut up by ravines and water courses, so that it would have been difficult to find an even piece of ground large enough to review conveniently a considerable body of men, half of whom, moreover, consisted of cavalry, without going some distance from Scutari. At last the plateau in front of the General Hospital was fixed upon as combining most advantages. Separated by a ravine from the BarrackHospital, and skirted by the long line of dark cypresseswhichadorntheffamous cemeteryof Scutari, it slopes down towards the Valley of Haidar Pasha, forming an inclined plane, whose summit is crowned by a few solitary trees, which form a striking object on the brown clay. The only disadvantage was a ridge which runs through the centre of the plateau, intersecting it, and. t4hus preventing the eye from embracing the whole ground at once. Just in front of the General Hospital, which crowns the edge of the plateau towards the sea, tents had been erected for the Sultan and his suite, and to the right of the tents a stand for the ladies. The time fixed by the Sultan for the review was 5 o'clock, Turkish time, or about half-past 10 in the morning. The weather, which had been very promising the day before, threatened a change. A strong south wind rose, upheaving the waters of the Bosphorus, which rendered the passage across somewhat difficult for small caiques. Admiral Grey had, however, taken the precaution of having three of the steam tugs ready at Tophaun for those who wished to go across, one of which wAs destined for the Ambassador and the Foreign Miristers who should wish to attend the review, tie other two for the rest of the public. Iivitation3 had been sent to the foreign representatives, which were accepted by the Prussian and Belgian Aninisters and the Charg6 I d'Affaires of Piedmiont. The Frenchi Ambassador e-,x cused himself, it being mail-dy;. but sent two-of his aUaM6sto-repres*nt hiin '. A~ s little.before'll eve'ryboy -wa on;the¶ ground.'

There is perhaps no country in th6.rworld. where-the person of the Sovereign is so exalted in the nds of the people<as in Turkey. The religious character of hIs authority, the mysterious-seclusion in. whicb. his privato life passes, all tend to sur,round the person, -of the Padishah with a halo which has .vanished from the crowned heads of Europe, if it ever. existed. Every step which he makes in. public is followed by the eager gaze of the multittde which is sure to collect on his way, even on ordinawy occasions, such is his visit to one of the mosquesonFriday. Thousands of the inhabitants of Scutari waited likewise for his amival at the review. The whole road through the cemetery, which leads up to the ground where the review, was to take place, was Ened by the male and female part of the population, whose many-coloured galrments contrasted beautifully with the dark hue of the cypress rows. Not less animated was the sight of the re; view-ground itself. The Sultan's body guard, in their red jackets, occupied the southern face of the ovalimnmediately in front of the General Hospital. On the opposite side the infantry occupied the'lirst, the cavalry the second line. Nuumbers of horsemen, officers as well as civilians, and some ladies, on every description of steed, from the thorough-bred d6wn . to the rough country pony, added not a little! to the liveliness of the picture, while the ladies on the stand and the crowd near the Sultan's tent formed a corresponding background. At 20 minutes past 12 the sound of the guns placed on the cEffs behind the Barrack Hospital announced the arrival of the Sultan, when General Storks with his staff, and the Ambassador with his suite, rode down as far as the village of Scutari to meet him. Soon after the whole cavalcade, augmented by the cortge of the Sultan, appeared on the summit of the plateau, where it was received by the sound of " God Save the Queen." His Majesty, with the Ambassador and General Storks to his left, then passed be'fore the line of infantry. Already at the flirt step his attention was attracted by the bearskins of a detachment of 'Guards and Highlanders, who occupied the extreme right of the line, and he stopped to address some questions about them. When passing the Polish Legion, which formed the extreme left of the line, Count Zamoyaki, who commanded them, was preserted to His Majesty. Aimong the' cavalry the 12th Lancers, mounted on their Indian horses, seemed above all to strike his eye. Having passed thus both lines in review, he placed' hiniielf in the centre, and the order was given -to the troops to wheel round by comp'anies anid troops. It was now that all the advantages of the ground becam'e apparent. As the troops wheeled round on the summit of the inclined plane you saw them coming down for some distance, while the eye could follow those who had passed for a great while longer, so that the effect was much more imposing from being concentrated, and the troops looked double their number. In front of all came the detachments of Guards and Highlanders; although scarcelytwocompaniessitrong, composed of different regiments and clad in every kind of uniform, yet the size of the men, their soldierlike expression, and the steadiness of their step, produced a good effect under circumstances in which most other troops would have appeared ridiculous. They were followed by detachments of British infantry of the line, formed into 10 companies. Collected likewise from different regiments, this would have been scarcely perceptible, had it not been for the many-coloured facings, so united were they in a body. It was like a solid wall composed of different kinds of stone, bbut cemented together as one, and you forgot the component parts in the appearance of the whole. INext came the German Legion, with General Wolridge at their head; the Jager battalion first, and the three light infantry regiments after. Whoever had seen them at the review at Kululee, some time ago, could not help being struck at the progress which they had made in such a short time. It seems the officers have not been discouraged by the prospects of peace, and have followed up zealously the work begun, although they had to do this under' the apprehension of never seeing the fruits of their labours. Nobody could have recognized in the legion the soldiers of a few mtonths drill. The German was followed by the Polish Legion, which formed the last body of infantry. It is a strong set of men, not a few of themn old soldiers. The Horse Guards have not displayed a very brilliant taste in most of the new tuiforms which they devised. That of the Polish Legion, provided it was the idea of the Horse Guards, is perhaps least of a failure. The blue tunics and trousers contrast well enough with the red shakos, and the gaiters and shoes are a decided improvement on the old boots. At the head of the cavalry division was Captain Thomas's troop of Horse Artillery, the same which was last autumn at Eupatoria. This troop passed the winter in Balaklava near the ascent to the Mfarine Heights. As they were among the first to think of stabling their horses they have more of the old horses left than perhaps any other body of artillery or cavalry which passed the -winter before last in the Crimea. Some months' rest at Scutari, after the work at Eupatoria, has brought them into excellent condition, and as besides the troop is composed mostly of old soldiers it would be impossible to see a finer troop anywhere. After this troop of artillery came a squadron of the 11th Hussars, commanded by Major Cooke, which has beenformed as a kindof depot duringthe winter. They are all new horses, which have never been in the Crimea, and the men mostly recruits, yet they made a good show, which is very creditable to the officer who succeeded so well in so short a time. It would have been only desirable that the Waroffice should have extended its liberality towards the depot here at Scutari as well as to the rest of the 11th in the Crimea, and, instead of sending the famous 1,200 " cherry pants" to the Crimea, had sent a few new pelisses or tunics to the depOt. As it was, the men were obliged to wear their old clothes, and those not aU of the same description, the front rank being accommodated with pelisses, and the rear rank with tunics. The King's Dragoon Guards were the next re- giment. A look at the horses, as well as men, was sufficient to convince that they were one of the regiments sent out later, which had escaped the winter of 185441855. They looked the beau ideal of heavy cavalry. After them came the 4th Dragoon Guards, the 5th Dragoons,ithe Scots Grays, the Enniskillens, and the Royal Dragoons-in fact, the original Heavy Brigade sent out at the beginning of the war7.One could not see this goodly. array, making the ground tremble under their heavy step, without straying back in imaggination to April last, when the ruins of the splendid old Heavy Brigade! were basking themselves in the first watery rays of the Crimean siD, especially ' as the white wall running along the cliffs of Scutari Point, and enclosing the graves of many a brave fellow who had been the pride of the Heavy Brigade once, was distinctly visible from the' ground where the review took place. There were the graves and here was the Reavy Brigade, arisen a,,ain, as it were, to new life, F-and bidding fair to emulate-the glorieg of their-pre. 'cior3.

However one mayregret that ignorance and mismanagement have destroyed the first Heavy Brigade, one was partly reconciled to the low of the first by- looking at the second, a a proof of the resources and strength of England strong enough to convince the most in.credulous and inspre with confidence the most timid. The 6th Dragoon Guards or Carabineers were at the.head of the Light Brigade. Thiey- may be said to represent for the English cavalry what the Chevaux Legers are for continental armies.-that is, a mediumbetween light and heavy cavalry, and as such they may be said to be perfection. It would be difficult to fnd a body of cavalry anywhere where the chief requisite in cavalry is so well attained, viz., where men and horses are so well matched and are as one. It would be' well to pay some attention to this point, especially as regards our light cavalry, wlich is different in name more than in anythgin else from the heavy I cavalry, and, from the want of proportion between man and horse, is less able to attain its object, which is speed rather than weight. The men are too tail and-the accoutrements too heavy; the reduction of both would allow the use of lighter horses, which, if well-bred, would stand arduous outpost duties better, and would be much more fit for reconnoitring or CwUps de main than the present. The l2th Lancers, on their Indian Arabs, who followed the Carabineers, were an evidence of this on the spot. The impossibility of having English horses in India forced the cavalry regiments sent there to employ Arabs. Those of the 12th Lancers are a cross between English horses and Arabs, bred in the' native Government studs. The smaller horses necessitated a reduction in the size of the men, and the result was an excellent regiment of light cavalry. These cross-bred horses are perfection for light cavalry. They stood the climate in the Crimea far better than the pure Arabs of the 10th Hussars, and are more up to weig,ht, without being behind them in speed and endurance. The 13th and 4thLight Dragoons led the van of the Light Cavalry Brigade. Although they have lost perhaps more men in the Crimea than any of the cavalry regiments which were there the winter before last, they seemed to have quite recovered, and worthily concluded this splendid display of cavalry. In the rear of aU came a troop of Osmanli Horse Artillery. The felt helmets covered with red cloth look rather strange, but for the use of men who have to unlimber and limber up again guns a lighter kind of head-dress than the kalpaks of our horse artillery seems an imlprovement, although it does not look so well. - When the troops-infantry, cavalry, and artillery ,-had thus passed once, the cavalry and artillery passed once more at a trot; The narrowness of the ground, which would have made evolutions for such a large body of horse impossible, set off to advantage their numbers when theypassed; and on seeing this apparently interminable host sweeping along one could acarcel believe that there were not more than 3,000 men; if one reckons the German Legion at about as much, the Polish legion at 700 or so, andthedetachments of British infantry about the same, there were between 7,000 and 8,000 men on the ground. After the cavalry and artillery had marched past the Sultan thanked General Storks, and complimented him on the appearance of thetroops. Thenthe 'whole cortmgc rode to the tent, where the Sultan dismounted and stopped outside. A detachment of the 13th Light Dragoons kept the ground clear in front. The Sultani conversed for some time with Lord Stratford, and then expressed a wish to see Lady Stratford and the Misses Canning. Besides this,he desired to have all the commanding officers of brigades andregimentspresentedtohim. In general,heseemed exceedingly gracious and well pleased. Usually he has an expression of enini and weariness in his faee, in some measure attributable to the immobility which etiquette prescribes to him in public, but whether he was in 'good humour this day, or whether the military sight had ,excited him, certain it is that he looked much more lively than usual, and took a good deal of interest in the appearance of the troops, as his repeated questions while they were passing showed. At 2 p.m. he gave the order to have his horse brought; and rode off towards the Palace of Beglerbeg, where he had crossed over. Pontoons had been laid down in the little bay behind the General Hospital, but, the weather being rough, he preferred crossing higher up the Bosphorus and riding over from Beglerbeg. The steeplechase, which was to have taken place on AMonday last, was postponed on account of the review, and came off on Tuesday. The ground chosen for it was a flat piece of land, near a farm belonging to the Sultan's brother, about seven miles from Scutari. There were four races, one of them a pony race for poniesof 13hands3. Thefirst threeraces were of three miles, the fourth of two. In the early pI of the day the weather was favourable, rather close, but hazy and with not much sun. The distance prevented many people from attending, nevertheless from 500 to G00 horsemen and several ladies mustered. Some of the leaps were as formidable as any in England, and many were the spills, but no accidents, except to Sir W. Gordon, l'thLight Dragoons, who broke his collar-bone. The last race was run in a shower of rain, which did not prevent the more eager of the spectators from remaining to the end. To-day the flat races are run near Eaidar Pasha. The Sultan, when apprised of this circumstance at the review on M1onday, offered to give a cup of 5001. for the occasion. As, however, more, but smaller prizes, seemed desirable, he determined to give six cups, one for each race, and he has given: orders to the Mint, which is usually charged with these presents, to make six of the coffee-cup holders used in Turkey, inlaid with diamonds. .They will be rather interesting souvenirs of the campaign for the 'vinners. The Russian Palace, which, as you well know, has hitherto been used as a French hospital for officers, has been evacuated in consequence of the conclusion of peace. The patients have been taken to the upper part of the Dolmabashi hospital, which had been .hitherto used for wounded. The chancery of the Russian Embassy will likewise be evacuated, and the Intendance which has occupied it until now is transferred to the Hospital of Pera, where the ground floor has been prepared for its reception. Afif Bey, the bearer of the treaty signed at Paris on the 30th, arrived yesterday on board the French steamer Requin. The Council has assembled for the reading of the- treaty. The Imperial Irad6 has been given to the Otto- man Bank.

Great as is the interest attached to the act which closed the war, it would be an error to uppose that-the affairs of Italy excite little curosity, and, I may. add, little hope, in the public. It is expected that the British people wFil learn through their Parlia. ment, on which the attention of all is now fied, matters that have not been noted down in the daily minutes of the conferences, and which may not be comprised in the protocols that are destied to see the light. TheEnglishMinisters havealaborioasbefore them. I have little doubt that Count Cavour will be ready to afford them all the assistan-e i-a his power, aud that he will complete the infor. mation which, regularly or irregularly, he has communicated here. 'What space will be filled in the last protocol by the Italian question I cannot say. It was desired, I believe, that as little as pos. sible should remain recorded, on the ground of its not falling within the competence of the international Council to discuss it thoroughly or officially. Some think that a brief notice is all that will appear; others, that sufficient will be said to mark the opinion of England and France on the conduct of Austria and of the rulers of Italy. But, whether that notice be brief or long, it is nevertheless certain that Italy occupied no small space in the later conferences, and excited the warmest contro. versy. This will probably come out in Parliament for there can hardly be wanting a curious friend or adversary to exercise a gentle violence on the affected coyness of the Cabinet. It is not from the moniteur that we shall have the fullest revelations; it is from the debates inthe British Parliament. In some circles here the Italian question is touched upon with the utmost delicacy. It is sought, above all, to attenuate the importance people attach to it, in spite of official reserve. They have an instinctive feeling that no other for the present is more mo. mentous, and that if nothing be done to allay-dis. quietude, to calm irritation, or inspire hopes, it will sooner or later assume more formidable proportions. I have already noticed the denials or quibbling of the " Vienna correspondent" of the Constitutionfld about Italy and the Congress. I would not for the world insinuate that the correspondent who professes to write from that caplital has not a real existence there, notwithstanding the occasional slips that might induce a suspicion to the contrary, or suggest the absence of the unmistakable cacwt, which, whatever other errors a writer may commit, proves, at all events, his presence in the locality from which his letters are dated; but the " Vienna correspondent" of the Constifidjonnel enjoys an immunity which must make him the envy and admiration of his less privileged conffrres. He either possesses the supernatural giftof ubiquity, or he is shot along the electric wire from Vienna to ParL, simultaneously with his letter, for it is said he may be seen on the Bo0ulevards on the very d;y his com. iaunications are dated. Why one should taie the trouble of darting to Vienna and backl, exposedto the consequences of encountering, an electric flash 'coming in an opposite direction, or why one should take the trouble of shooting to Vienna for the purpose of giving news from Paris, is more than I can say. But, whatever be the process of such rapid locomotion, it is certain he has until now denied the fact of Italy having been discussed. To day, howvever, he admits that " the word Italy has been pronounced," but qualifies exceedingly the part attributed to Count Buol and Count Cavour. "The question of Italy has been only accidentally touched on," "it ought not to be attributed to the Sardinian memorandum, which was not communicated to the Congress," and " the sitting of the 11th of April showed the firm resolution of the Con. gress not to travel out of the programme limited to the settlement of the Eastern complcations." It was only the question of the occapation of Greece that suggested the mention of Italy, which was "saisi au vol." by the Sardinian Plenipotentiaries to show an analogy between the two countries in this respect. The few words spoken, on that flying topic were as little important as any chance remark of Count Orloff to Count Cavour on the state of the weather. He adds that " all that has been said on both sides has been inserted in the protocol." I must doubt this fact; I have reason to believe hat it was not theintention that all that had been said on Italy should be recorded. This, however, we shall soon know. It may be true that no formal resolution was adopted -with reference to this subject, but it will be found that the question was not regarded so lightly as people endeavour to persuade us. I believe that it is con. sidere-;by somne at least of the Plenipotentiaries, as not much inferior in interest to the more legitimate subject which originaUly called them together, and I doubt not they have separated with the conviction that it is one whichwill yet call for the attention of Europe. Much stressislaiduponthe fact of the Plenipotentiaries havingtaken an amicable leave of each other at the close of their last meeting. It is trae that those gentlemen shook hands and bowed, but I should like to know the last few words which passed between Count Buol and CountCavour at halfpast 6 oeclock on Wednesday evening in the conference chamber. I do not think the Austrian Plenipotentiary went away in the belief that' the Italan question could be arranged with the maintenance of the stahts qTo, and I am certain that anything Count Cavour said then or before did not lead to such a conclusion. The Patne announces that, after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of peace, Count Orloff is to proceed to Pisa, where one of his sons is staying. Some journals had erroneously stated that he was to visit Naples. Lord Brougham arrived in Paris from Cannes lsat night, and leaves to-morrow morning for London. AIUSTRIA. (moM ou0 oTw COaumm-oxDz5-T.) VIENNA, Ar'iun 17. Oneof the most important conditions in theTreaty of Peace is, that none of the forts on the east or Circassian coast of the Black Sea are to be rebuilt by the Russians. When the protocols of the Paris conferences are published it will be seen that one or two members of the conferencewereinclinedto exactfrom the Russian Plenipotentiaries a promiise that theforts lying between the river Terek and Tiflis should be razed, but the demand was not insisted on, as Count Orloff positively declared that his Government would never agree it. The c.hain of forts alluded to is that which, running from Ekaterino. grad, on the Terek, by way of Vladikaukas, through the pass of Dariel, divides the Caucasian isthmus into two almost equal parts. As the Eumine is, to all intents and pluposes, to be a commercial and neutral sea, the Turks will not be Allowed to fortify any of the ports on its southern coast. My informant refused to enter into any further details, but he hinted that the northern part of Sebastopol was not to be razed. I endeavoured to learn whether anymention had 1wen made at the conferences of the Russian vesseLr. now lying at the bottom of the great harbour of Sebastopol, but no information could be acquired, on the sabject. The Irieste ZeitUng contains smme intelligence which cannot fail to interest trav ellers to and from the East. The Austrianuloyd's 'has atlength established a direct communication %etween Trieste and Constantinople, and fast stearmers are to accomplish the voyage in rather less thr n six days. The usual weel;y boats, which tou& at the various Italian, Ionian, Greek, and Turldi,h ports, will continue to ran. The voyages botmween Constantinople and Trebizonde will be mor e frequent, and clippers ae to run between the firit-mentioned city and Galatz, where they will meet, the fast boats of the Dasrabiau Steam Navigation fompany. The Austrian Loyd's, which is strinin', every nerve in order to keep pace with its var lous rivals, is increasing-the inumber and improving the quaity of its steamers. On the 12th the stes'.ner Union, a vessel of 1,500 tons ani 450-horse power, arrived from - America for tbe Austriani company, and not long since two vel7 fine bo,tts, the Aquila Imperiaje and tie Progrrso, were built for it at Glasgow.

THE.4 10oo2 CONTROVERJSY. TO TEM EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Considering that the proposition advanced by your correspondent, the " Inspector of Schools," is in direct con. tradiction tD the conclusions of all the more eminent astronomers of the present and the last age, and that it relates not to a point of abstruse mathematical physics but to ,one depending on the most elementary mechanical principles, it would be *wonderful indeed if it were not completely erroneous. Now, although it certainly is so, it is very evident, from the matter of Mr. Symons' letters as well as from the various answers which they have elicited, that however universally the moon's rotation has been admitted, the reasoning by which it has been established still requires eluddation and development before its conclusiveness can be perceived by ordinary minds, and I think it would be more rational to supply such elucidation than to attempt to pooh-pooh the question. I am the more free to say this, as I have attempted myself to elucidate the point in more than one of my elementary works and public lectures, and I ronfess that something more seems to me to be required to satisfy conmmon minds. Although a daily paper is not the place for such an exposition-and I shall not, Etherefore, attempt it-I will suggest a point of view in which the question may be regarded, and in which its elucidation would be useful. If a terrestrial globe-take for example, Wyld's great globe in Leicester-squaro-be placed with its axis parallel to the axis of the earth, it will be carried round the centre of the parallel in -which it is placedin 2.3 hours 56 minutes, presenting, like the moon, always the same hemisphere to the centre ofthe parallel. Nowv, the same reasoning which proves the moon's rotation must equally demonstrate that Wyld's globe rotates on that diameter which is parallel to the terzestrial axis once lin 23 hours 56 minutes. Can it be expected that common understandings will readily admit this upon the force of the received demonstrations ? To take another illustration of this principle: a mountain -the Peak of Teneriffe for example-is moved round the centre of its parallel of Latitude, presenting always the sane side to that centre. This mountain is not a globe like the moon, and has no geometrical line analogous to the moon's axis; buat that does not affect the principle of the question. The same reasoning which proves the moon to rotate on its xis must establish with equal conclusiveAess the rotation of the Peak of Teneriffe upon a certain line as an axis of rotation, that line passingthrough the mass of the mountain in a direction parallel to the terrestrial axis, the time of rotation being 23 hours 56 minutes. I can only repeat that the point requires more clear exposition than it has yet received. Your obedient servant. DION. LARDNER. April 2L A " RATE7 FoR HAmPslnD-HEAr.-At a late -hour on Saturday night a meeting of the residents of St. 'John's-woodwas held at the Swiss-cottage, St. John's-wood, to adopt measures to prevent the enclosure of Hampsteadheath. Several gentlemen addressed the meeting, and it was urged that the only way to secure the open space for the public was to enter into a "compromise" with Sir Thomas ML Wilson, who bad a bill in the Cornmons to - enable him to build on the property. A sum of 100,0001 wasproposaed, and it was stated that a rate of 2d. in the pound by the Metropolitan Board of Works would pay the money, ;s the property in the metropolis liable to be rated was estimated aZTR2,0000001. Considerable discussion arose onthe suaijct, andit wascon2idered that, astheheath was forthe benefit of the public, the inhabitants should cheerfully pay the money. Onthe other side, it was stated that *fS,OO2l. would be a fair sum to start with to secure the -opeg space for the prublic.

MOKNY-MABRlTandCITYNITBLLGENCZ, - Monday Evening. The English funds again opened this mnorning without the slightest change, and remained quiet until the afternoon, when, in consequence of a sale by the Court of Chancery, a decline of an eighth took place, 'the market closing with a dull appearance. Consols for money were first quoted 93 to A, - and they left of at 93 to I for money and 93*to 4 for the 8th of MIay. Banik Stock closed at 212 to 213; Reduced, 91s to 92; ;New Three per Cents., 92E to i; AnnLuities, 30years, 17 to 1-16; India- to 230; Indin-bonds, 9s. to 4s. discount ; E3xchequer-bonds, 98k tLo i; and Exchequer-bills (March), par to 3s. premnium; (June), &s. discount to par. It is stated that the dealer whose failure was announced on the last settling-day in the StockExchange has since arranged to meet all iis liabilities in fuiL There was littIe activity in foreign securities, but quotations generally wrere fairly maintained. Turkish Sit per Cents, were neg,otiated at 9SA for money, and 98j, i, and t for the account. ~The Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, were operated i at 102 and 1011-. The other business comprised-Brazilian Small, 99k; Buenos Ayres, for account, 6O; Ecuador New Consoldated, 14; Granada Deferred, 74; Mexican, for account, 23; Peruvian, 78 and 77X; the Three per Cents., 544; Russian Five per Cents., 106 and 105k; Sardinian Five per Cents., 9g5 and 96; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 45§; the New Deferred, 244 for money, and 244 and i for the account; Datch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 64k; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 93k. * The corn-market this morning was without alteration. The Liverpool cotton-market, in consequence of the American advices, has opened this week with increased animation, at an advance in most instances of d. per lb. he final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 74f. 50c. for money and 74f. 55c. for the end of the month, showing firmness in the former case, and a decline of an eighth in the latter. The French rate of exchange continues with a favourable tendency. From Hamburg and Amsterdam the quotations to-day are also rather better. The rate of discount at Hamburg, which was recently 7 per cent., is now 6X. Letters from Riga of the 14th inst. mention that the ice in the river had broken up tw-o days previously, and that the arrival of vessels at the port and the general resumption of navigation might be expected in a fortnight, if not sooner. The reports from the manufacturing towns of the state of trade dluring the past week are all satisfactory. At Manchester there has been an increased business, advancing prices constituting the only check to the extent of operations. At Birmingham the iron-market shows continued steadiness, and the general occupations of the place have been fairly sustained. The Nottingham advices describe a large export demand for hosiery, which has caused a further reduction of the already moderate stocks, although purchases on-home account have been limited. In lace the transactions have not been numerous, but prices are high and firm. In the woollen districts there has been a good average business, and the market at the close presented an encouraging appearance. The Irish linen trade g,ives continued signs of animation, the home consumption and the'orders from America being alike active at ful quotations. The commercial advices from New York this week state that the stock-market remained without animation, chiefly from a cause similar to that which has so long operated on this side-namely, the continual absorption of bullion. Although the Californian steamers bring, supplies largely in excess of the amounts required for remittance to Europe, the tendency of the totals held by the' banks is constantly to decline. The sums held in the interior must therefore be unprecedentedly large. Wliile the banks were losing their bullion they were extendingtheirloans and discounts, and hence among cautious persons there was a feeling of uneasiness lest a sudden restriction should be found necessary. The spring trade in European manufactures had been very active, and the aggregate value of the foreign goods imported during the first three months of the year was 10,375,0001., against 7,040,0001. in the corresponding period of 1855. Several failures had recently occurred in the Western States among provision and grain speculators, but the losses were confined to those districts. The amount of specie broughtbythis steamer is only 40,000L., owing to her having sailed from Boston, but a larger supply may be expected by the Atlantic, which will be due on Wednesday. The launch of the Adriatic for the Collins mail line had attracted much attention, and she was to be ready for sea in about two months. Her measurements were 354 feet length, 50 feet breadth, 38 feet depth, and 5,900 tons burden. The English Govetr=ment had sent gold medals to the officers and crew of Dr. Kane's Arctic expedition, and a vase of silver to Mr. Grinnell, by whom, with a subscription of $10,000 from BMr. Peabody, of London, the expedition was originally arranged. A present of plate had at the same time been sent to Dr. Kane, which, by the rules of the United States' service, he was precluded from accepting. Nicaragua Transit stock had scarcely experienced any recovery, the quotation being 14. Erie Railway was quoted 5%i; Reading, 02 to A; Panama, 105 a=-; and Illinois Central Bonds, 87 to ;. From Mex;ico the latest accounts were dated Vera Cruz, the 26th of March, but they furnish nothing mYaore than a statement that the Reaetionists in Puebla surrendered to the Government forces on the 22d. The subjoined letter relates to the petition in course of signature against the contemplated abolition of the English statite requiring the evidence of written contracts in all cases involving 101. or upward, so as to assimilate the law to the Scotch system, according to which verbal proof is admissible. It may be questioned if the alteration one way or the other will produce the inconvenient effiects apprehended, and it would be undesirable that any obstacles calculated to interfere with the task undertaken by the LordChancellor of bringing the mercantile law of the united kingdom into harmony shoald be raised in connexion with it. Looking, however, at the approval with which the law as it stands has always been regarded in London, where all the transactions of the world centre, together with the reasonableness of requiring that those who think a contract worth making shall take the trouble to pass a written memorandum of it, so as to prevent the risk of future litigation, it is not surprising to find many persons of opinion that if a change must be made the assimilation of the Scotch practice to the English would have been the better course. The writer of the annexed communication thinks it hard that the innumerable contracts carelessly concluded without any wvritten note should be 4unprotected, but the Legislature are certainly entitled to say that if traders refuse to take ordinary precautions they are not to be permitted to come into a law court to have their negligence redressed: * Sir,-Can you kindly spare me spice for a few remarks upon the petition which yon printed on Saturday, to be presented to the lbouse of Commons against the proposed repeal of the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds ? " The petitioners state that the, mercantile business of the city has growfn up under its provisions, and that they are unable to discover any advantagein the proq,osecl alteration. *4To wvhich I reply that the mercantile business has grown up rather in spite of than under its protection; 'for not one in ten thousand of the daily transactions of this great city from 101. upwards are protected by a written contract of purchase and sale. "W lhy, then, are these innumerable contracts to be unprotected by law? Their existence proves that this provision of the statute is useless. Why, then, retain a penal statute merely for the sake of protecting one class of transactions,which the petitioners state will always be committed to writing, whether this law be repealed or not? WVhy incumber the thousands of transactions above 101. with a form because the special transactions of merchauits require written contracts9 " This law appeared to be more necessary when the evidence of principals was excluded from our courts ;but surely the petitioners need not be mot~e afraid of being called uIon to fulfil contracts they never heard of when the English law is assimilated to the Scotch law than they are now afraid of being called upon to fulfil a fraudulent written contract. "No law will prevent fraud, but imposing upon every one the duty of attending to. their business and of relying upon their knowledge of the parties with whom they deal, instead of upon formazl technicalities, will interpose mucht greater difficulties to fraudulent transactions than thissectioa of the Statute of Frzauds. " at present the.great bulk of our transactions are carried ci in defiance of the law, and unavoidably so ;.-nd, if there were no other reason, this is alone one of suiicient impoHance to justify the alteration now proposed to. be cmnade by the Lord Chancellor. -" This petition is another of the many evidences we have of the great difflcilty of the task of the law reformer. . " The simplHication of the law is opposed in every quarter, aad, in this, case. although we have evidence that ii Scotland neither frsad nor inconvenience arises from the wanit of complsoryritten contracts yet a number of men of business step forward and express their desire to perpetuate this usele&v section of the Statate of haids.

TDE C1UMBAN BOARD OF JNQQUIBY. The Boend of General Officers resumed their inquiry at Chelsea yesterday morning. The number of distinguished virilPert Wio availed themselves of their privilege of entrJc "ut grcater then on any previous occasion, and during the sloy nearly %V,00 of the general public were adnitted. ! tenrd. ican asked Colonel Tulloch whether he would yroducersletter which on a former day he had stated was n his Vssession or in that of Sir John M'NeiW, in which the-Gavernment had intimated their approval of the report of-tiLa commissioners. 'ilonel Tulloch produced a copy of a private letter fron St. John M'Neill to himself, the whole of which he should 'ot like to give, but from which he had nxo objection to read -the followiug extrct-wt Lord Paumure told me he ha%d read every word of it (the report); tlhatt l:e considered it temperate and moderate in its tone, and intimated no ob'ection to anyF part of it, en-. cert that h-e v.considered te molrtality returns out of place in th at repc,.nd that they would snore -preoeerly form Na tof the relittLry etatits which yt were in the habit of .aying before l½iiausent. this OlumOn -I cenocaunicate to ,you by hinrslhi'p's-desie2' BEa-ks this, he beicved thrice wvas uew in the possession of t;he Board anwodfialletter intimating that Lord Pilmerston A 'the -Xonse dr'Commmsns had -gtated that the commisvAiner' report had the approval of 'ihe Government. TheJi'5DGs-ADVOcM.kl said iheZ :oard had no SuC Iletter 4wil'hefr:posszssion. Colonel Tulloch hili received.+ letter to that effect, and -wouldilay it beforet!heeBoard. -Admiral Sir :Ke.nud -Ly-ar, who stated that he vas 'second in conamr.nd of the ;ilack Sea fleet in 1354, and * ftktnvrds succe.ded to the -eidef command in the room of -Admiral:Dundas, was then ezumined by Lord Lucan. VWere you uor applied tofor sails or canvass to shelter Ahevavalryho>rses-Certtir'ly not, and I never heard of -any epinion bcing oxpressed in regard to this use of sailcloth untilits-as mentioned in this room. I had ample opportunities, too, of krving if such an opinion had been 6titertained; for at that ritical moment, when the wants of 'the army were so urgeat-and their privations so great, I was in the habitof riding- irough the camp almost every day, accompanied by Cap.tin Drummond, of the Retribution, - and the-principal object of thesevisits wvas not only to ascer- tain. from Lord'ihagLav whether he had any request to make, but also to suggest zanything that might occur to me in whieh I thooght thb. resources of the fleet might be useful. SWhen unavoidable circumstances prevented me from going to Lthe caLmlp, Captain Drumnsond generally 'went alone, and Icertainly could not have had a better coadjutor, forhe is an officer no less distinguished forkindhearte(dness and-active benevolence than for gallantry and -ability. Mtoreover, he had a very large and extensive acquaintance in-the camnp, and yet w.e never heard a syflable -about ships' sails being applied to the shelter of the troops. In spealdngA-ef Captain D)rummond I mnay say that I have -been anxious to ascertain whether his opinions entirely ac.corded w ith mine, .and here is the ansver I have received from him:-" To have pat up canvass on the plateau vould have-been-totally uselecs, even if we had had themeans, which wehad not; it was consequently never thought of." I am quite certain that if such an idea bad ever crossed Lord-R7glan's mind he would have mentioned it, for he spoke tome-on all occasions without reserve. I was in continual intercourse with him, and it will ever be one of the proudest reflections of my life that throughout my long and continuous interchange of sentiments with Lord Raglan on -very important matters and on various trying occa- sions he honoured me with his entire confidence. It Xcannot be otherwise than a source of proud reflection to have had the entire confidence and friendship of so good, so high-minded, and so noble a crea-rureas he-was. Had such-an applicationbeen made to youin the months - of November or December, 1854, could you have given a suefficicit quantity of canvass to provide shelter for 2,000 cavalry horses 9-Such an application must have come through -Lord Raglan, and I cannot possibly admit that Lord RZaglan, who attached so much importance to the efficiency of the fleet, would have made such an application. I have -no difficulty, however, in answering your question ate'eorically, and in saying that I certainly could not have farnished- any such quantity of canvass. Lord Raglan kee perfectly well that the fleet had already landed about -4,000 seamen and marines, a very large quantity of guns, and ammunition of every sort. About .50 or 60 carpenters -and as much sailCloth nas could possibly be -spared- had been alreadyLanded lord Raglan knerw that the ships were lying off an enemy's coast in a very tenmpestuous sea and at the very w orst season of the year, vith several vrecks of English transports close to it; and he certainly was not the man to have asked the Commander-in-Chief of the fleet to give sailcloth at such a moment and under such circunmstances. Had you at that time 15 sail-of-the-line at Kamiesch 9- Certainly not. We never had anything at Xamiesch largerthan a steam-frigate. IHad you 15 sail-of-the-line in any contiguous bay or bays i-No ! We bad twvo sail-of-the-line in the contiguous bay of Kazateb, but, although Kamiesch and Kazatch are contiguous, they are totally different in character. At Eandesch I have seen seven or eight French sail-of-the-line and 200 -or 300 merchantmen. I should add that at liamiesclh the ships could always communicate with each other and with the shore; but at Kazatch the case was quite different. We could never get more than two sail-ofthe-line there and a few merchant ships, and the shelter afforded was very little. What was the largest number of line-of-battle ships you ever had in the Black Sea 1-Eleven, and that only for a few days. What was the average number, to the best of your recollection '-Seven. -Wlhere were they stationed9.-Five were employed in -watching the coast at that time, and two wvere stationed in K.azatch-bay, principally as depots for supplying the army. Could you have spared carpenters fromn the fleet in sufficient nunmbers to construct shelter for the whole of the cavalry i-N\o, we had already 30 carpenters attached to the -Nav-al Brigade under Captain Lushington, and there were :0 more at Balaldava, all employed in service connected with the army. Colonel Tuoch seems to be under the impression that we had 15 sail-of-the-line, wv.hereas we had not quite half that number. He seems also to have looked to the establishment and to have con.eluded that the complement of every ship was complete, whereas we had hardly half the complement. It results, therefore, that, as far as the line-of-battie ships are concerned we had only one-fourth of the numaber of carpen-terswhich Colonel Tulloch imagines. But then he is also under the -impression that we had 30 or 40 steamvessels whose carpenters, or a portion of them, ml ht have been -employed in the service of the army. Bat thscee steamers were employed on various duties, such as going backwvards anId forwards to Constantinople for supplies, blockading a thousand nidles of coast, includingtlle coastof Circasas,a Kerteh; the Crimea, the Dnieper, and the montths of the -Danube;. and w hen those vessels rejoined the ileet, instead of theirbeing able to spare carpenters -for the anry, we *.vere obliged to give them carpenters to complete their repairs. It results, therefore, that we had tnot one man who coud by an possibility have been spared for the army :from thlose vessels. Colonel TuLeloc, aLso, . as I said before, seemed under the impression that te 15 sail-of-theline of which, lie spoke were lying in a snug harbour. Colonel Tulhch was not there, and of course he believes it; but; he has been misinformed. Now, what ams the fact?., -The vessels were - at anchor in 40 fathoms of water, within a imile of the rocks, and only just out of gunshot of the batteries of -Sebastopol; indeed, on one occasion the Royal Albert- dr;ve within gunshot. I should observe aso that -the-state of the weather was such as to render it absolutely necessary to prepare for every emergency. The Board may judge of-the stato of the weather when I tell -hem -hat in oaneale the Roval Albert lost her rudder, which broke in -two; she wvas 31 days at anchor before Sebastopol without -a suoder ;.and I see by a note from Sir Thomas Pasley that all the carpenters of thee 'eet were emxloredd.uringi those 31 -days in- repairing the rudder. The ruer of the Algiers was also - very much damaged;* and, as a proof of t=he suddenness with w9-hirls the -gales came on, I may mention that the -.second in comnmand and some of the captains of the fleet, ibaving come on board any hidp, were obged to remain on -fboard for several daystand nights. Now, under those ciro.uinstances, it must be - apparent to everybody that the tboats of the fleet, upon -which the supplies of the army were wrezy much dependent, must have been constantly getting soutof repair, and therefore that all the carpentersof the ceest were required afloat. Colonel Tulloch asks what there r,c -to prevenit me from -sending on shore 100 out of :ay 2Q0 or 300 carpenters. - Now, speaking from mnemory, 7 b-diee-0 we never had more than 50 or 60 carpenters avail- ale. JIt must be rememberedi too, that I had the supplies ef any. own fleet to think of. The fleet experienued very r lea dixiculties as. regarded -its resources, and tie only r sason-why this vas ne.sr publicly knots-n wvasbecause these di 85 iile,-mvere overcome.

Lord Raglan was extremel- partictla.r on -tbhat poit,. sai seldom or never made evess an ofEcial request w-ithout accompanying it by -nm explanascry private letter. In eroa.ainaon -by G;lonel --Tulk^h Sir Edmutnd lyons stated that eaa'-ship-ssnt!er ordinar circumstances f -ad a spare sat .f sails- Did not recohlectjchat quantity of -reserve canvacs or ~sjparEsails theta ought, te,be on board.sy an SO-gunlt hp.

In :additionla this thega was old , anaz3 on board, but he had already stated th:rt aU the efoare, canvass they had was sent on shoare for the nor of the %aal, Erigade.

Those spare sails might at arq ioment I requbwstl, in,i w;ithout them no ship could &e conside.ed ,,e ffelit, ,paticularly on a caost like that. As to procasrir at-S 'pjy of .&canvass from Constantinople -in a very sbQhe e 'd, there were other persons wtho could answer tat . "tostioi better than ho could. He izd never had oct \-n ± to send for it. Could speak moss confi- dently \ p_gard to the possibility of scuring (e-o.iCd Constantinople. They were so badly carpenters \fjg j:a the fleet that he was obliged to write off for carPe± ~ aigta dia r lo the Admi 14X hting that Admiral Grey m the Bos- phorus andiAd2 Boxer were both constantly applyin ph , and Adn .1 that there were not enough to keep the for arenbasin are . In reply the Admiralty said they thought his applicath, ' for more carpenters a very reasonable one; they were 'umrprizedl, indeed, that so muchl had been done with the mea-,'. sat the disposal of the fleet; buta they could not gossibly seL 4 any more, for there were none to be got. Instead of being a Jk to procnre carpenters from Constantinople, Admiral Gre/ wAs obliged to send to halts, and offer verY temu-ting W4 tp the M-altese -t reUead peform the indispensabO" Wltt1 of IJJ:fle?t in ttg- Black Sea and ir the Bosphorus. Not one carpenter was to De had froin Constantinople. Colonel Tulloch.-You are referring now to ships' carpent. Do younot think, as Constantinople Is built of wood, that carpenters capable of puttinag up frame*io-gK must be numerous there, and might hAve been prOCwedi IA order to provide temporary shelter 9 Sir Edmund Lyons said h', did not know hbjw an Admtarl on board the fleet wvas to know this. Of one thing he was quite certain-that An the straits to which thy v were reduced Admiral Grey wou old have got carpenterS itrom anywhere, had it been -ossible. It must be recol) ected that, although Constar sinople was built of wood, yet in conisequence of the -equirements ofthe troops thlere stationedthe erection of temiiporary hospitals, barra.'ks, and stablesthere was A very mnusual demandfor carpenters, and therefore the, inmpression on his niind Nms (though he did not speak, from his own knowledge) that it would have been extretiely difficult to get carpfluters there. It was im,Plssible for himn to say whether 'carpenters mighbt nOt have oeenprocured for a few day;, upon payment, from the transports and merchantusan in Balaldava; bat he could produce ample proof to show that everything was done by the -At mirals and senior officers to serve the arnT, both 'as regarded the employment of carpenters and the prcviding of other assistance. Witness repeated that, esatead of 15 sail-of-the-line lying off Kaniesch, as stated -by Colonel Tulloch, they never hadmore an 11sail-of-the-line at any one time in the Black Sea, the average neumber b6ing seven, of which two were at Kaxatch, and were used as *depots, and the rest were stationed at different points alonz the coast. Colonel Tualledl explained that he had probably confouded ships-of-the-line with smialler vessels of war, but that mistake was an obvious one; for in another portionDf his statement before the Board he spoke of there being 14 ships of war above 50 guns in the Black Sea altogethler. As to the nunAer of ships, he had taken that frout the Navy List of the-date to which he had referred. Sir E. Lyons said that front the reports of Colonel Tulloch's statement in the nevspapers (which perfectly accorded 'with the official minutes of the proceedings) it might be supposed that there were 15 sail-of-the-line off Kamiesch. Colonel Tulloch.-Although you consider sailcloth would not have been suitable to the plateau, might it not have been used with advaitage in the Valley of Kadikoi ?-I have a very strong opinion that on the plateau, as Captain Drammond said, canvass would have been worse than useless. As to its employment in the Valley of Kadikoi, that is a nilitary question which I don't like to enter upon. Geeneral BERsEEuSY.-You have mentioned that you wore constantly in the habit of riding through the camp and lines. Did it strike you that any want of promptitude or ingenuity existed in not having the cavalry horses more under shelter 7-Certainly not. I saw a great many officers occupied in sheltering their horses-the horses of their regiments as well as their ow n-in a way which appeared to me mostefficacious-namely, by throwing up an embankment to a certain heighit to protect the horses from tUe piercing wisids. Sir George Brown's horses never had any other covering from first to last, although they were often dug out of the snow. I believe Colonel Wood, of the Royal Artillery, who saved all or most of his horses, did exactly the same; and I perfectly remember that Lord Raglan expresned to Colonel 'Wood, in my presence, his great satisfaction at the way in which he had sheltered these horses. Perhaps the most direct answer to the question is that everybody appeared to me to be hard at work and doing his best in this way. Colonel Tulloch.-Were you aware that the order to provide tentporary shelter was given on the 12th of November, and yet that shelter was only completed by the middle of February ?-I don't pretend to be cognizant of the orders that were given. Miglht nbt this lapse of three months, during one month of which nothing was done, imply a want of promptitude on the partof some one.7-I cannot constitute aMyself a judge of what ought to have been done in the camp. I do not at all admit, however, that I was ever at the camp a month and saw- nothing done;* they were always doing, and always appeared very hard at w ork. The JUDGE- ArwVocgr.\T-The Board wishes to know whether you consider yourself competent to speak further as to the " want of promptitude or ingenuity" displayed in providing shelter for the cav-alry 9.-No, I do not. My opinion. is, as far as it goes, that there w.as no want of promptitude; but I cannot constitute myself a judge in military matters. The JUDGE-A\DVOCAE said that the Board had no more questions to ask. Admiral Lyons observed that, with the permission of the Board, he would state a few facts which appeared to himn to bear very closely upon the question-he meant as to the possibility of affording assistance to the anmy from the fleet and w ith whlich hte thought it very desirable that the Board should be acquainted. The JUnGE-ADVOCATE asked to what question Sir Edmund was about to reply. General PEE:, interposing, said he would remove any difficulty of form, by asking, as a definite question, whether the witness could give the Board any further information as to any assistance which conld have been afforded by the feet to the army. Admiral Lyons.-In looking back upon the Crimean expedition there is nothing at which I rejoice so much, next to the glory of our arms, as the good understanding and perfect harmony whiclt always existed between the two services; and Ithink it will be a very lamentable circumstance indeed if anything arising out of these proceedings should vweaken those cordial feelings. I am very far from supposing that Colonel Tulloch intended, or intends, to cast any blame on the navy for not giving assistance to the army. On the contrary, what he seems to regret is that assistance was not asked for from the fleet. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the effect of the course which he has felt it his duty to pursue lias been to raise a question generally in the public mmd whether there were not articles on board the fleet which could have been spared for the use of the army, had they been asked for or offered. Now, for the informas tionof the Board, I wil give as succinict an account as I can of what the relations between the two services really were, and I shall not go further back than the landing of the army in the Crimea-that gallant army which 'was destined to perform deeds of matchless valour and to undergo unparaUeled hardships ! Lord Raglait in his despatch describing the operation of landing the troops was pleased to say that the conduct ofthe navy was beyond all praise, and I am quite sure there is not a survivor of that army who can forget, or who does not readily admit the assistance rendered by the navy. They will recollect that the seamen were up to their waists in water the whole day, in order that the troops and theirautmunitionmight belandeddry, and Ifeelnow, asI felt at the time, that the spontaneous cheer wvhici was given on that occasion, when the soldiers marched front the beach, and when the sailors returned to their ships, was an earnest of that harmony, good understanding, and mutual good-will which has happily been maintained ever sitce. StiU less can the army forget, and, indeed, it always acknowledges, the assistance derived from the navy after the battle of the Altoa, when the sick and wounded were carried down to the beach a distance of four mniles by the seamen of the fleet. There u-as a scorching sun, cholera was very rifeindeed, the fleet wuas stiil smarting under the visitation of that disease-and it was under these circumstances that the sick and wounded soldiers were carried down in cots and hammocks upon the seanien's shoulders. No one who witnessed, as I did, the gratitude of those poor fellows wlten carefully lifted into the boats, could doubt that at that moment was excited a holy and kindly feeling between the two professions which cannot fail to bring forth good fruits. Some of those men died in the boats, more died on the passage to Constantinople, and yet more died in the hospitals of that place; but it is niot unreasonable to hope that, through the blessing of God, some may have returned to their homes and families; and these will hand down to posterity the recollection of the treatment which the army met vwith'fromthe navy. I would add that I seldom pass a day in London Without meeting some officer wi.o reminds me of the inValaabl6 services rendered by Lieutenant Goss, of the navy, in superintending the embarcation of many thousands of sick and wounded at Balaklava. In like manner, toa, I am continually reminded of the invaluable assist'ance tendered by Lieuteitant Hawkins at a most critical moment, in forwarding ammunition to the front, under difficulties which an ordinary man would have deemed insurmountable. I have here a letter from myself to thte Admiralty, which will show that neither labour nor materials were sparingfly or tardily given by the navy when required for the use of the arnmy. Lord Raglan requested rue to furmish a few cots in which to take the sick down to Constantinople, because the transports then at Balaklava were not fitted for that purpose. At the same time he reuestedme to make as soon as possible a number of cartridges for the use both of time English and the French army. The letter to which I allude is dated " Royal Albert, off Sebastopol, April 7, 1855," and is addressed by me to the Secretary of the Admiralty. In it I state that Lord Raglan having requasted me to get sailing vessels fitted for the reception of 500 or 600 wounded men as soon as possible, several sailing transports u-ere immediately selected for that purpose ; but it was foundthat with the limited means at our disposal it would take too much time to fit those vessels uip. I therefore directed that cots and cot frames estould be made on board the ships of the fleet under my command, and, working from Thursday afternoon to Sundsay, 742 cots and cot frameswere madeandsent to Balaklava, while, at the same time, 20,000 cartridges were made for time use of the English and French armies before Sebastopol. ,It w;ill be in the recollection of the Board, no doubt, that thme saferings of the army were very considerably increased an consequence of the soldiers having no means of roasting the co-lee, and that this was a subject of the greatest peasible axiety to every person in the army, from the Comnmander-in-Citief downwards. At that time Captain Heath, of the -navy, a most excelent officer, whose exertions for the assistance of the army were really beyond all praise, commanded the Sanspareil at Baiaklava. He, knowing the anxiety felt in the camp on the subject, and having perfectly.satis' ed himself that no means of roasting the coffee -were to be found there, set his wits to woir. in order to overcome the difficulty from the resources of his owvn ship. He thierefore Nwrote to Lord Raglan, Dlecaember 6, anTsaid that.amogr the many discomforts wltich the army must necessarily suffer, more especially during the exAsting deficenc,y of land transport, the scarcity of fuel seemed to him to be cae of the greatest. It liad struck him that if the coffee then issued to the troops in a raw etate could be rowated at Balaklava a great saving of fuel would be effected, and that the comfort of thLe soldiers would bestillmore increasedbythe savingoftimeaad trouble which must also necessarily be effeated, as compared with the tedious process carried on in the camp. Captain Heath said that he thought he could malie on board hiis ship (the Sanspareil)roasting machines sufficient in size and raumber to roast the daily allowvance of cogieo for the use of die army, but that Sie should wish to know' before he epaged in such a work, -wvhether Lord Raglan apuroved of it. He added that he was quite aware that such a proposal did sotconte exactly within the limits of a naval oBoer's daty,but that lie believed his Lordship was willing to lizton to st& weigli suggestions from any quafrter which were oruopted by a desire to benefit the army. I was with LO Raglan when he received this letter, and I can never 4ozset the joy depicted in his countenance when he read it. ',3cing his hand upoLnmy shoulder, he said, I I What wonclr&Il fellows you sailors are; what should we do wit.hout you?'t Well, the offer was accepted, and I have read a letter from *General Airey expressing the very warnest thanks on the part of Lord -Eglia for that offer, And begg_ng Captwi Tha$Jh to 93n it itlmw ett a, pw;I as sovsible, - Thbre was no object which the - Commander of lie Fr5 more earnestly desired to see accomplished than 'xAre troops should have their coffee roasted. The same CA^ain Heath, on hearing that 300) fine miules were expected from Spain, and having witnessed the former losses occaioned by wantof shelter, offered to Lord Raglan to build from the resources of the fleet stabling for those arimals. Ihavealetterhereinwhchhe says, 'As all our skilled carpenters were already employed for the arny. I did not like to withdraw one of them, but f placed 30 or 40 seamen under the direction of a boatswain and they erected these stables:' I believe that a great many of the miues thus sheltereo are alive now. But it does not follow in the slightest degree that the army could have done the sanme thing, for Captain Heath told me that the reason why he offered to do so much was the conviction upon his own maind that it was impoEsible for the army to do it, having so many other things to look after, and it being with the greatest difficulty that it could convey supplies and ammunition to the front. There is another point which I would wish to mention-that Captain Lushington, with the carpenters at his disposal, built at least 20) huts for the army. Again, it would have been very difficult to carry on tle siege had it not been for the " promptitude and ingenuity" displayed by our engineers, who, when the touchholes of the guns were rendered useless-the metal having run, from constant firing-by a very ingenious device bouched the touchholes, and thus rendered the guns again serviceable. Another of the great difficulties with which the army had to contend was the want of landing-places at Balalslavs,-a difficulty which appeared to be insurmountable, but Admiral Boxer built a wharf, which still beers his name, alongside of which the largest steamer-such as the Himalaya, for example-could come and land men, horses, or provisions. I take no credit to the navy for all this. I: was their bounden duty to do what they did, and Iam only saying that it was done, and done most cheerfully. I could adduce a good many other instances of the kind, but I think the Board must ho already satisfied that the navy did aU in its power to assist the army. I could say with great truth that, w hile on the one hand the navy gloried in the deeds of the army, sympathized with its suffermsgs, and renderedit every aid in its power, the army, on the other hand, was never slow to acknowvledge those services, but, on the contrary, always expressed the deepest gratitude; and thus there was fostered a kindly feeling of mutual confidence and goodwill between the twvo services wvhich was m aterially conducive to the happiness and honour of both, and wvhich, by increasing their mutual efficiency, was consequeutly highly advantageous to the country. Colonel Tulloch remarked that he never meant to infer that there was a want of cordiality on the part of the navy, or an indisposition to render assistance to the army. Oin the contrary, he had stated that " a ksinder Admuiral could not be found, nor one more willing to afford every assistance in his powver. Major Conolly, called andex;amined by Lord Lucan, stated that he had acted as brigade-major of the Heavy Cavalry D)ivision in the Crimea. He was ready to prove that, so far as regarded the Heavy Brigade, the returns given in the appendix to the Report, of the number of men and horses employedin conveying sick and commissariat sto:es to the front, signed by Colonel Hodge, were totally incorrect. To show the anxiety of lord Lucan to do what he could to protect the horses witness read one of his Lord.ship's divisional orders, dated the 1st of January, in which he reminded the officers that there never was a tine when they should pay more strict attention to their stable duties and to the maniagement and care of their troop horses, and impressed upon them the necessity of coilstant vigilance and zeaL Lord Lucan repeated this caution on various occasions to the officers commanding brigades and regiments, and witness remembered his saying that they had better aU take care anld do their utmost, for sooner or later the blame for the calamities that had occurred to the cavalry was sure to be thrown upon them. It was certainly not Ihis opinion that auy commanding officers of brigades or regiments were deterred ordiscouraged by any act of Lord l,ucan's from giving shelter to their horses; on the contrary, his Lordship had encouraged and urged them as much as possible to provide shelter. Inde: the circumstances in which they were placed he did no; think, in his humble opinion, that the cavalry could have done more than they did, or that either Lord Lucan or the officers commanding brigades and regiments could have displayed more promptitude and ingenuity. He was absent from the Crinea until the 5th of April, and on his return the only time he met the commissioners was once at Colonel Griffith's. He believed the Scots Grays changedtheir encampment about seven tihes before the 14th of November; the horses might have been shifted oftener, but he thought not so often as 20 or 27 times. He endeavoured to procure canvass for nosebags, and was promised at Balaklava a sail for that purpose, but he never got it. There were peculiar means which enabled the artillery to shelter their horses better than the cavalry, having carts, tools, and artilecers in greater numbers than the cavalry. Having been much in consmnunication with the French army he could say that not one French troop horse was butted during the time he was in the Crimea. The French cavaly lost a great many of the horses brought from France, but the French were not in the habit of pubEshing their unavoidable losses, andhe would not like to mention particular reg,iments. One French cavalry regiment lost so many horses that at the end of the winter the few horses left were handed over to another corps, and the regiment was entirely remounted upon horses brought from France. Another regiment lost S0 horses in January alone, the Erench cavalry having no transport duties to perform or pickets to furnish. Trenches dug for horses would require to be paved, or, if not paved, would have to be renewed daily. In answer to General BEREiurY, the witness said the inltrenching tools were few and bad. Constant requisitions were made for new tools and sometimes none were obtained, there being none in suppiy. General PEEL-Th French cavalry did not use canvass to cover their horses. Colonel Tulloch then put a number of questions to the witness, who, in reply, stated that the returns signed bythe cavalry officers dated the 1st of October wrere not signed until later, as parts of the regiments only had arrived at that time, and the officers signed the returns which had been kept open for them. He did not consider that retimns so made were false returns. In reference to a statement of Lord Lucan's that no Heavy Cavalry were in the Crimea on the Ist of October, the wtitness said the disembarcation of the Heavy Cavalry commnenced on that day, when the whole I of the brigade, except a portion of two regiments, were in harbour. The officers commanding brigades were the proper persons to make returns, and upon returns so made the commissioners would be justified in relying. The returns of men and horses employed in the conveyance of provisions and sick quoted in the appendisx wvere incorrect, as his own daily returns would show. The returns which appeared in the appendix of the commissioners' report purporting to show the number of men and horses daily employed in carrying provisions and sick were not correct. He had found the inutibty of unpaved pits for horses from personal expenience, having, in the month of June, placed a tent in an excavation with every improvement which the past winter had proved to be necestsary, and upon the occasion of a sudden storm the whole was washed away, and he remained standing up to his breast in water. The examination of Major Conoily being concluded, that officer said he was desired by Colonel Hodge, who hat signed one of the incorrect returns in the appendix, to express that officer's great regret at having been the unvilling means of misleading the comnnissioners. The fact was that he (Major Conolly), upon whom, as Brigade-Major, it wvoul I have devolved to make such returns, was absent, and Colonel Hodge, the senior officer, upon being called upon by the commissioners, applied to a soldier who had acted as his (Major Conolly's) clerk, and who furnished a report, which Colonel Hodge signed believing it to be correct. The JunDGE-ADvoCATz, on behalf of the Board, inquired of the witness what was the state of the men's health in the months of November, December, and January, and were they capable of perforining other duties besides their ordinary duties? Major Conolly replied that the Division had never been free from cholera since August, and there was also much fever and dysentery. Of the men who were reported noininaUy to be fit for duty at that time fuly one-half in time of peace would have been sent into hospital. Colonel Low was then recalled by Lord Lucan, in reply to whom he stated that he believed the French Artilery horses were eniployed to carry un stone to pave the stables of the horses of the Chasseurs d'Afrique. Lord Lucan referring to that passage of the commissioners' report in which they stated that the manner in which he received Colonel Griffith's suggestion was such as to deter other officers from making similar proposals, asked the gallant witness whether he would consider himself justified in allowing an alleged altercation between the General of the Division andanother officerto prevent him from doing all he could to shelter his men and horses. Colonel Low replied that nothing would deter him from looking after the welfare of his mnen and hor-ses. Lord Lucan had certainly not discouraged his officers, but, on the contrary, had encouraged them to make every effort to provide shelter. He thought that, under the circumstances in which ithey were placed, it would have been impossible to display more promptitude or ingenuity, and that every man and officer did his best to provide shelter for the horses. No other witness being called, The BOARDinquired whether Colonel Tulloch was prepared to proceed with his observations. Colonel Tulloch replied that he was not. It would be necessary for him to communicate with Sir J. M'Niell, who was at Edinburgh. He had no legal assistance, and thereforewould ask the Board to adjourn until Monday, as the evidence was veryvoluminous, and he had not yet had time to read it. Besides which, he had duties to perform which w.ould occupy him one or two days. T:e BOAR.D intimated an opinion that the adjourmnen' until Monday was too long a period to lose, and suggeste 1 Thursday. Colonel Tulloch, however, stated that Friday would be the earliest day on which ho could undertake to proceed. The Board retired to deliberate, and upon their return The JuDGE-ADVOC,ATE announced that, althou"h thY Board regretted the loss of public time, which woouhd ais' put its members to personal inconvenience, yet, as Colonel luhloch had stated that he could not be prepared befor 3 Friday, the Board would accede to his request. The Board then adjounmed until Friday.

Great changes have been recently taking place in the buildings of the school. A new edifice has been erected by the liberality of the assistant masters and parents of the boys, containing six additionalsehool-rooms, rendered indispensably necessary by the largely-increased numbers oftheschooL At the same time, the school chapel has been undergoing a process of almostentiretransformation. A new aislehasbeenaddedto the original building from funds derived from the same source as tlhat above mentioned, and a beautiful chancel erected at a cost exceeding 2,500, bythe munificence of the head master, Dr. Vaughan. These additions to the chapel I have been designed by Mr. Scott, who has also furnished 1 plans for the complete reconstruction of the original portion of the building, calculated to require 4,0^1. in addition to C the sum already expended. Great exertions are making n among old Harrovians and other friends of the school to effect this object, which wrill make Harrow one of the first schools in the country in that architectural beauLty -which has jhitherto been too much denied to it. I GCLASGOW, April 19.-Cotton.-In the early part of the week there was considerable animation in our market,and large sales were made at higher prices. The tone of the market has become much more quiet, and part of the advance has been lost. In goods and yarns the market continues to exhibit a very healthy tone, and with a large demand and light stocks, producers have little difficuity in realizing enhanced prices. Iron.-The past week has been Imuarked by an active speculative movement in the pig-iron F market, excited by the very favourable export returns, and perhaps more immediately by the fact that iron-masters and miners have faUen out upon a question of wages. This strike has been pending for some time, but has only this week assumed a serious aspect. Einployers are ahnost unanlimously deternined to resist the demand of their workmen, even to blowing out furnaces, and already about 20 per cent. of the whole have been damnped, soon to be foll owed by others. An extensive business has been done up to 76s. cash, and 77s. Gd. three months for m.n. warsants, the highest point being reached on Thusday.

POLICE. L"SIOyN-lou0.--John Griffith was charged before the LoRD MAYOR with burglary. John Carter, of }o. 71, Lower Thames-street, said,-At about 3 'clock yesterday morningP, hearing a noise in the house, I came down stairs, and sawv a man in the act of getting out of the wdow into the yard. Mr. Tomlinson lives in the house. I don't know the prsoner, and cannot swear that he vas the person. I gave the alarm, and the police afterwards caught some one. I lost sight of the man when the police took up the pursut. Joseph Toinkins (587).-I heard a breaking of glass on Sunday morning between 3 and 4 o'lock in Lower Thamesstreet. On proceeding to the spot I saw the prisoner running 'from the court at 71,Lower Thames-street, and lost sight of I him for half a minute, and I saw him immediately afterwards in the custody of a policeman (75 H). I am certain the prisoner is the man. W. Startin (75 H).-I heard a spring of a rattle, and saw the prisonerrunnig towards me. I caught hin in Trinity. square, and brought him back. C. Button (569).-I heard a cry of " Stop thief "' and proceeded to 7L Thames-street, and found the window open, and outside the window I found the look-ing-glass and workbox produced. I then woke -lr. Tomlinson. In the room on the ground floor I found the drawer open. I found in the street a lucifer match, a snuffbox, and other things. Mr. Thomas Tomlinson, of 71, Lower Thames-street said,-The property produced is mine. My wife and children slept in the house on Saturday night. The goods were left safe on that night, and the window had been broken and the drawer had been forced open in the morning. The son of the prosecutor said,-I slept in the house on Saturday night, and I went to bed at a quarter to 11 o'clock. I locked it up. I was woke by the policeman. I found the wmndow on the gr--nd aoor had been broken in two of the suares of ga the articles in the room were safe on the Saturday aight Sonme lucifer matches corresponding with thatfound upon the prisoner were stated to have been found in the room fiomu which the goods had been taken. The prisoner, upon being asked whether he wished to say anything, said, " To say9 NYo. I don't know what it's all about. Ihad nothing to do v.ithanythingv rong. They can't say that I was concerned in anything bad." The prisoner w as then committed for triaL. MRLBoRouGu-SThETr.-An immense mob congregated round Marlborough-street police-court, about 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, in ^onsequence of the capture of the person who was presumed to be concerned in the hoax relative to the peace uzroclamation by Royal aulthority, 'with wihich the metropofis had been plentifolly placarded,-aproeceeding that had drawn thousands of curious people to the different localities where it was announced the Royal herald would deliver his official information. A young man, who gave the name of Gaspar Collard, wearing a herald's tabard, profusely decorated with tinsel, lhons, and unicorns, a blue velvet hat and feathers, and altogether made up in true theatrical style, with moustaches, long curling wig, &c., was charged with an assault. Joseph Davis, a groom, said he was in Hyde Park that afternoon looling at the defendant, when he wasastruck by the defendant with his whip. After being struck, the defendant, wlho was on horseback, attempted to ride over him. Mr. leadley, the chief Cerk, inquired if the mob were following and hooting the defendant. The complainant replied in the affirmative, but he was not one of them. Mr. BIGILka (to defendant).-What have you to say? Defendant.-Iam employed by Mr. Grevill Potter, of Oxford-street, to read a proclamation at various places today announcing to the public that it his intention to give away portrmitsof theheroes of the Crimea of many hundred pounds value. About 5,000 bills have been posted in different parts, and because I was behind the stated time, and ,the people were kept waiting, they became infuriated, and lwhen I nade my appearance in Hyde Park the cries were " Pull him off his horse ;" and I should have been pulled off |my horse if the police-constable (Saint, D 183) had not interfered. I only struck in self-defence, without assaulting any one in particular. Iam only a servant acting underthe instructions of another. Inspector Bester.-This sham procLamation has been the cause of great annoyance to the publc. Thousands have assembled in different parts, and tradesmen have been obliged toshut up their shops. MEr. BI.GIMrnx.-I think the defendant's conduct is, to say the least, very indiscreet, for he might have periled both limbs and life in going among the mob. I shall not treat this as an assault, but only as a piece of tomfoolery, which I should advise the defendant not to repeat. in collecting a large mob by such ridiculous means you make yourself a small nuisance. You may go this time, but first take off that absurd dress. The defendant was thenreleased. WORsEsP-s=T.-William Lundy was charged before Mr. D'EYscounRT with the following burglary:- Mr. Humphry Clare, residing in lxuttesland-street, Hoxton, after carefully securing his premises, retired to rest with his family on Sunday evening, leaving his sister who did not go to bed til much later, and lay awaL-e til 2 in the morning. She then distinctly heard the sound of footsteps outside her bedroom door, and, on lifting up her head, saw a man with a lighted candle in his hand quietly enteringtheroom. She thoug,ht her brother had been taken ill and wanted something, and therefore called out his name, but no answer was returned, the light was immediately extinguished, and the intruder rapidly made his way out again. She atonce saw there was a thief in the house, ran tothe door, and raised such an outcry as to alarn her brother and the rest of the inmates, who hurried down stairs, but too late to catch the thief, who had escaped at the rear, leaving the back door wide open, an entrance having been effected by forcing up the kitchen window. A constable was procured, and he, on examining the back of the house, traced the impressions of naked feet through the mould of that and several other gardens, till they at length stopped at an outhouse a few doors off, and there he di5covered the prisoner secreted, divested of both stockings and shoes. Sergeant Judd said there could be 'no doubt that the -prisoner had been connected with other burglars in that neighbourhood, as the overcoat he had on at the time he was taken had been identified as part-produce of another robbery; anda lady named Yarrell, residing in Somerset- Place Horton, caine forward and stated that on the night ofMon. day, the 17th ult., her house was entered and robbed by some burglas, and among other property stolen was a coat 'of her husband's, which was that produced. The prisoner had nothing material to say, and was remanded till that day vweek on both charges. CLERKM-NuVELL-Yesterday morning the ClarkenweU police-court was crowded to excess upon its being known that one of the gang of hotel plunderers who have for months past been con-anitting depredations at the principal hotels of London, Paris, Manchester, Havre, Liverpool, and the chief provincial towns of the 'United States was to be brought up from Liverpool for examination on the charge of stealing a large quantity of notes from the GreatNorthern Hotel, King's-cross. The prisoner, who gave the name of Benjamin' Allen HXoward. and described himself as a merchant, of WVisconsin, United States, was brought up in the custody of Sergeants WV. Smith, of the E division, and J. Scott, detective officers, and wmas charged with having on the night of the 18th of March stolen from a -bedroom at the Gxreat NSorthern Eotel,.Xing's-cross, about 5601., the property of Mr. Stamisland, a solicitor of Boston, Lincolnshire. The prisoner is a smart-looking Yankiee, w ith a moustache and beard, and wore elegantly cu clothes and coloured boots, and had with him a quantibty of}most valuable jewvelry and a fancy stick, wcith a gold horse's leg 'for the hsandle. Mr. Stanisland said he resided at Boston, inLincolnshire, and on Wednesday, the 18th of MEarch, he came up to town, having.'in his possession abcout- 5651., consisting of -three Bank of England notes of 1001. each, the remainder being in Boston notes. lie went to bed at the GEreat Northern HIotel at about half-pas 10 the: -ame night5 'tAking the pirecaution of farst locking the door. lin the rm-orning wchan be left his bedroomn he felt in hic trousers pocket, *nd then diccovered that his purse am gd sQey were not tliie . H bei gav c isgn4tion 'o . 0 . . . ... . ...f : . ... .. .~~ iTe police, and, having ascertained tne nnumber of the notas,; foun that one of the prisoners companions, named of Howard Kingston, hsd paid one of the 1001.- notes to Messrs. Emery and Co., tailors, of Regent-street Thexr could be no dolubt that he had locked his door when he went to bed, but to suppose that a man was rafe in locekng his door was now an exploded notion. Before prmceeding fartherwiththe case hewouldexplaintolhisworshim theproceedings ofthegang of whichtheprisonerwasone,an; eofwhichtwo others were now Cormmittedfortrial at Manchester. It appeared that the prisoners had lately paid a; visit to Manchester, and Oscar Kingston had gone to the P;oyal Hotel there. A Mr. Edden, of London, also slept at the Betel that night, having, when he weimt zo'ioedat s- little after 9, locked the bedroom door. At about halfpast 2 on the fqU.owing morning he was awoke, and wias very much sm!prseced to find a manin drawers and a Jersey vest at the foot of his be rifing his pockets, and, upo askdng him what he wanted there, the nian bounced out of the room; and, although Mr Eddenat once made after him the man escaped, he notknow7ingo,which waly he took alon"thecorredor.However, one of thewite s hearingtheuoige,lookex over thebalustrsand saw theprisonerenterhisbecdroom,and he -wasthen gtiven iato custody. On that occasion iaotes to - the value of 25C. had been taken from one of the trousers; poclkets, but the man had dropped them ia his fight and they werefound m the corridor. How to account for thedoor being opened was then a puzzle, but this was shortl afterwards elucidated, for although tlhe man had divested himself of everything which could lead toa suspicion of hiscilling, yet between Mr. Edden's bedroom and the prison_ - ers were found two instruments. One of these was a ps - of steel pliers or forceps, the two ends of which when pl in thekeyhole form a barreL This enabledthe person whew the door waslocked on the inside to turn thekey left in the lockc, and when- the robbery was effected and the thief lef the room, he could relock the door without the necessity of reraoving the key. The other instrament founnd--sa mortiEing chisel, entirely of steel, for opening boxes, &c. He had also ascertained that a box had been sent fror Havre to another of the prisoner's companions name Branch, and which there could not be much doubt was the result of the Paris campaign. This man Branch had been apprehended on the charge of five robberies committed on Tuesdaynight at the Albion Hote, Manchester, and now stands committed for trial on a charge of stealing some property belonging to a Mr. X de Burgue. Among the luggage of Branch was found a foruidable instrument used by thieves ia New York termed a "knuclde duster," and which was described as a thick flat piece of metal about three-quarters of apound in weight, with boles. at one of the edges through which the four fingers of the hand can be passedL When put on for use, and the fingescliached over it, the larger portion of the metal fils thefist, while the outer edge presents four rings of solid metaL over the kmuelkles of the second joints of the fingers calu"lated to give powerful effects to a blow strack bythe wearer. He (Mrt Stanisland) should prove the passing of two notes/ for 1001. each, and should then ask for a remand, as he ha& little doubt that a great rortion of the property found on the pnsoners would be identified. Mr. J. lt. Owen proved that one of the 1001.-notes haa been passedatMr. Spielman's, but the chief clerk, who coulct. identify the nman who paid in the note, was unable to be present. The person who changedthe note had the greater portion of the change in American dollars. The hall porer at SMorley's iotel produced a bookt, it which was an entry of Thoslin i,son, New York,15th of February, 1t56." he sawthe prisoner write his namey in the book. It is the practice of Americans visiting that hotl to writetheirnamesinthebook incase any of their friends should calL. Sometime after the prisoner called; that was about a week after. There could be no doubt that. hingston and the other prisoner lnew one another, forthey conversed and wvent out together. The prisoner, upon being asked in the usal w ay if he had anything to say, replied "NXothing." MIr. CORRIE remanded him for a week. When thc prisoner was searched there were found upon. him two valuable gold diamond rings-one of them worth about 20l The prisoner was apprehended on board the Persia, American steamer, justasit was on the point of leaving Liverpool for New York. He had on a belt containing 115 halfsovereigns, 78 20-dollar pieoes, 34 5-dollar pieces, and other property of the value of 6001 -There is a large quantity of property in the hands of -the police, and if hotelkeepers andk others who have been robbed will communicate their losses to Scotland-yard they w;ll be alowed to see the several articles. T1AAmJ-John Harrington, aged 2G, and Dennis Harrington, 20, Irish labourers~, were charged with assaultin" and wounding Jeremiah Lynch, Mary Lynch, his wife, an; J ames Lynch, their son, in Ratcliff. The charge originated out of a formidable Irish disturbance which took place on Monday morning in a narrow court called Stonestairs, near the -waterside, when Wary Lynch. was severely wounded, and was removed to the London. Hospital, in the Whitechapel-road, in a most precariousn condition; and a medical certificate was put in stating that. she was ina dangerous condition. Jeremiah Lynch, the husband of the injured woman, said! his 'wif e was dying. He produced the clothes she wore at. tbe timne. Theywere onemaRssof bbood. Pclice-sergeant Campbell, o. 44 K, said the woinan. Lynch,whowasintheospital, hadbeen fearfully wounded, and when he saw her she was quite insensible. Hewas afraid she would not survive. Mr. YARDLEv said if that was the case the deposition of the woman ought to be talen as early as possible, and he (the magistrate) would pirceed to the hospital for that purpose as soon as he was assured that she was in a fit stats to give her testimony. The evidence of Jeremiah and James Lynch, father ana son, was taken atlength, and it appeared that the prisoners, who live at No. 8, Stonestairs-court, two doors frona the LFynch family, 'were dlrinking and "larkinge' nearly the 'whole of Sunday night, and at 4 o'clock esterday morning invited old Lynch and his nife and son-to drink wvith them, and began "Larking" with their neighbours. The fun was continued for some time until the prisoners, without any provocation, commenced a furious attack on the Lynch family. The old man was knoclked dow n and kicked in a. savage manner, and when his son camne to his aid he was also beaten. Mrs. Lynch came to the assistance of her husbaud and son, and Dennis Harrington, whob was arrned with a poker, beat her with it over the headi and shoulders, inflicting severe wounds and contusions. The poor woman rushed indoors with the blood streaming from her, and while she was wiping it off her head and face withl a cloth John Harrington flung a heavy brick through her 0arour window, and it struck her on the head, knocked herovwn, and rendered her insensible, in which state she was removed to the hospitaL Mf. YARDLEY directed Police-sergeant Campbell to proceed to the London Hospital and make inquiries concerning the patient Mary Lynch, and then remanded the prisoner until Wednesday. LAsaNmrTm-John Wake, a smart-looking fellow, wascharged with thefollowing impudent robbery:- John Ellis deposed that on Saturday night, while on hisway home, he stopped at a coffee-stall at the end of Kennington-Lane, and w-hile taking a cup of coffee the prisonermade a snatch at his watch, broke it away from the guard, and started off with his booty. He (mitness) called out, "Stop thief !" audthe prisoner was seized and secured, and the watch, which he threv away, 'was picked up. A constable belonging to the L division deposed to having been present at the Central Criminal Court in April, 1850, w.-hen the prisoner wvas convicted of felony, and sentenced to ten years' transportation. The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said he was intoxicated at the time; but his assertion was contradicted by thewitnesses. H[e accounted for his being at large by syng. that while at Bermuda himself and 13 other convicts bad volunteered to go to a part of the island where the yellow fever was carrying away by hundreds daily the public officers, soldiers, and natives, to act S nurse, and out of the 14 only himself and another survived. iFor this they both received a pardon from Government, and ho returned to hisfrdends in London. The prisoner was fully committed for trial at the Surrey Sessions.
ARIs or CA-AiG.Nu1G.-On Friday M%. Galtom gave bis second lecturesat the 'United Service Institution, the Hon. Colonel Lindsay, V.P., in the chair, which, being devoted to "Bush Manufactures," included a great varietyv of topics. Circumshnces may require tlle slaughter of cattle, when it is hi ily important to preserve the meat. Salt may be obtainarlc, but without salting tubs it might bepronounced impossible to salt the meat. Mr. Galtin says,Take the animal's hide, dig a hole or hollow in the ground and line it with the hide, and you are at once able to cura the flesh of the animal-to salt him in his own skin. If no salt can be had the meat may be cut into shreds and dried in the sun; it is then called "jerkeel meat," and if taut into bags with fat, it is the pemnmican" so prized by the Arctic voyager. Next comes the question, How to get fire? Flint, steel, and gunpowder wil produce a flash, but an inexperienced soldier would find it no such easy matter, even with these requisites, to lght a fire to boil his kettle. Mr. Galton took a little dry grass and inoulded it into the shape of a yet smnaller quantity of the grass, and worked it up with a little moistened gunpowder, and over it he next sprin ledsomegrains of dry gunpowder. The back of a clasp-knife arnd a piece of agate, quartz, 1int, or any siliceous stone that may be picked up, produce sparks enough to ignite the grass, but it simplyv consumes with a smouldering spark, which is not so readily made to burst into flame (which alone will kindle wood to, boil a kettle), as thn inexperienced would imagine, until they have tried it. It may be done by blowing by one who has much practice, but the readiest plan is to deposit the ignited tinder or grain m the bird's-nest already provided, and then loosely holding it in the hand to swing the arm rapidcl round in a circle. ir. Galton did sE, and in halfa minute bte whole bundle of cras burst int a flame, such as would be right cheering to the weary traveller or campaigner. Touch-paper, an invaluable article. may be made by well rnbbing ordiary paper in tobacco ashes.

The flashproducedmayserveasausefulsigsial, orwiti iton a dark night a beaten track;, or the marks of wheels, may be traced and followed. Green wood may be seasoned in a few hours by a process which Mr. Galton sljowed so as to ie fit for an axle. Broken wood-a shattered gunstock, for instance--may be made serviceable bv binding it over with nevr hide, which shrinks in the qn iith such irresi6table force as to keep the fibres of wood together, however much it may be splintered. Horn may be softened and worlked like gutta-percha, by subjecting. it to the heat of a sand-bath; that is to say, .of a . little sand in a pipkin on a fire.
