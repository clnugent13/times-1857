ISECOND EDITION. i' DJ2IMES r OFFCE !ThuIrsdaYM077bing. THE PE:ACE CONFERBNCES. ARIVAL OF THE TURKISH PLEIPOTENTIARY. (BY SUBMARM AND B31rrSH: ThEGnJAr.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch'from our Marseilles correspondent "M 3ARSEILLES, THuRSDAY, Fm. 21, 8 A.&. "The steam frigate San6, whichlef tConstanitinople on the 13th, has arrived, with Anli Pasha, the Turkish Plenipotentiary to the Paris Conferences, on board. "His Highness leaves for Paris this evening." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The foLlowing is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.:- The publication of an article from the Si&e in this day's Moniteur has produced a certain sensation in public. -The article is a reply to the Joumrna des Debats of Monday, which had' several of its columns filled with a discussion of the points that are to come before the Conferences. The Debats supposed itself to merely express the opinions of some imaginary correspondents in Berlin and Vienna; but the veil was too transparent, and no one believed that the reasoning vwas not that of the person whose signature was affixed to the article. Be this as it may, one of the principal questions taken up was whether Nicholaieff should or should not be comprised -among the arsenals on the shores of the Black Sea whose suppression wil be one of the conditions of peace with Russia. Whether Nicholaieff b0ong to the third or to the fifth proposition it will. have to be considered by the Plenipotentiaries,, and very probably one of the first. The reasoning of the Debats went to prove that the allies have no right to include it in that Category, and it declared in rather a decided manner that Nicholaieff could liot be considered as being on the shoro of the BlackSca. ' Indeed, the greater part of the articlein question might be very advantageously employed by Count Orloff and Baron Brumow in the discussion, and they might rest their case on a French journal of such influence as the Joeurnal des D6bats.' The Sice, which, whatever be its opinions on other matters, has certainly taken a manly and patriotic view of the whole question from the beginning, seemed to feel ashamed that the cause of the Russian Plenipotentiaries should be thus defended by one of the principal journals of France. It replied, and in the opinion of most people satisfactorily, to the Russian pleadings in the Debats.- The publication of the article of the Siecle in the offlcial journal is considered not only as a correction administered to the Dgbatsthrough the Siide,.but an interpretation of a still more significant kind is given to it. The rumour goes that it was at the Emperor's express desire that the article should appear, and the publication- in the Moniteser of the passages which insist on the destruction of Nicholaieff gives it no small importance. The following are the more prominent parts ;.- " There are journals which imagine themselves to be members of the congress, and which lay down and solve the msst complicated diplomatic difficulties with imperturbable aplornb The Debats is ef this number, and we would willingly pardon the littlo wealness which leads it to play the Plenipotentiary, as it played the General before, during, and after the siege of Sebastopol, provided the difficulties it enumerates were solved in a national manner. Bat the diploraatists of the Dbae4s are far from having the emsne tendencies as its generals. The military editor used to carry the Russian posiKon with fying colours. The diplomatist, on the contrary, leaves to the enemy, with a remarkable liberality, everything he may desire. Now, according to the Dgbals, the Turks, starting from the clear and precise text of the third point, are about to demand that the arsenals and dockyards of Nicholaieff be transported elsewhere. 'Accordingto ourideas, right and sense are on their side. Nicholaieff is as dangerous to them as Sebastopol, and, moreover, from its slips have gone forth exclusively the Russian navy in the Black Sea. But the Dboats does not think so. 6icholaieff, it argaes, is not on the Black Sea: it is a fewleagues inland, on tho Bug. Consequently, it is not comprised in Article 3. We need not prove thehollownessof this argunient. Itisnot only the shores of theBlack Sea that are to be liberated, but the Black Sea itself is to be emancipated, and, above all, the Ottoman Empireistobe placed beyondattaclc. Now,toclosetheErxine to armed navies, it is evident that the Bug must be closed. If that river remain open, there wi! he no closing the Euxine. Let us adroit that it is closed by a treaty; who in the world will guarantee that fact, if Nihoiaieff remain erect with its menacing arsenals and dockyards ? No large vessels will be constructaed there, but smaller ones willt make up by their number for their want of size. Sinope expeditions will leave the Bug and Nicholaieff, instead of leaving Sebastopol; that alone is the difference. The arguments of the D6daes, even if presented by Baron Brunow and Count Orloff, will, we believe, founder against the good sense . of alL No closing of the Bug,-no Article 3.- Nicholaieff extant,-no security. This is beyond doubt. With respect to Bomarsund, the D&bats, which has studied the treaty of Frederickahamm, asserts that the Russians possess the right of fortifying the Alr.nd Isles. Bet it thinks thpt, out of consideration for Sweden, not England, lussia vill not be intractable on that noint. If she does act thus, she will, whatever may be her reasons, act with good sense ; for the question of the possession and fortifying of the Aland Isles interests not alone Sweden and England, but also all Europe. MIistress of these islands, Russia not only dominates Sweden and the passages of the Sound, but she also menaces the commerce ot Europe in the Baltic, ana c6uld at any time impose her law on it. Finally, .with'n reach of the passage of the Sound, she has fleets whit h might1throw themselves on any given poimt of England, Holand, or even Frane. All Europe is, therefore, much interested in the question of the Aland Isles." After stating its opinion that these difficulties with respect to Nicholaieff andBonarsund are merely diplomatic scruples which wiU be overcome, the Sikde persiits in its declaration that even then the object of the war will remain unaccomplished, while the real stumbling-block is stiU the fifth article " The war bas not been undestaken alone to save the Ottoman empire. It has been said and repeated everywhere iii official regions that it was a question of the re-establishment of European equilibrium and the prevention of any futxtre invasion on the part of Russia. WVe demand that the conditions of peace shall strictly coincide with the programine of war." Mehemed Bey, the Turkish Ambassador at Paris, has returned from Turin. Two of the Secretaries attached to the Embassy have remained at Marseimes to awvait the coming of the Ottoman Plenipotentiary. Count Orloff, whose arrival at Brussels had been erroneously announced by the telegraph (it should have been Berlin), is expected hero to-morrow evening.

The evident desire of the Washington Government to pick a quarrel with England excites attention here, and people in office are strongly inclined to suspect the President of endeavouring, " to kill two birds with one stone." Inplain English, his partisans are believed to have two reasons for agitating against England : the one to secure the reelection of their leader; the other, to mak,e a diversion in favour of Russia. The incorrect telegraphic news of the departure of Mr. Buchanan from Englanid caused a slight panic here, but it ceased even before the intelligence was contradicted, as the moneyed world fimly believes peace will be restored with Russia, and foresees that the " states-men" will lower their tone as soon as they learn that such is likely to be the case. Austria is at present on very decent terms with the Washington Government, but she regards its continual endeavours to find a pretext for meddling in European affairs with such a jealous eye that the good understanding is not likely to be of any great duration. Count Ficquelmont, who cannot forgive or forget that the British Government in 184 and 1849 was willing to deprive Austria of a part of her Italian possessions, has just published a work on the Eastern question, which contains a great deal of abuse of the policy of England, and one or two facts worth notice. The Count, who not long before the Hungarian revolution had been Austrian Minister at St. Petersburg, relates that in 1840 the Russian Government recognized the principle of the freedom of the Danube, and formaly pledged itself to keep the Sulina arm in such a state " that there should always be water enough for merchantmen." After the Convention between Russia and Austria had been signed, and the ratifirations exchanged, the St. Petersburg Government ordered the naval authorities at Odessa to see that the sand did not accumulate at the entrance to the Sulna, andtheyfor a time obeyed the instructions which had been given them. The importance of the Danube to Austria and Southern Germany was at once seen, and the traffic increased so rapidly that Galatz speedily became a place of importance, and the great mart for the agricultural produce of the Danubian Principalities. As soon as the Odessa authorities remarked that Galatz was likely to became a formidable rival, they neglected to remove, the sand fronm the embouchurej of the Suhina. tssun, and boe. navigation of the Dl.nube was anierrupted iAs soon as it was' evident that the 3heger vessels could not pass the bar, i company of speculative Greeks appeared with a little flotilla ci lighters, anid demanded and received such enormous prices for- their service3, "that they could raford to allow ascertain salay to the 'Russian cmp1c;,es for their inactivity"' Such was the state of t2ings 10 years ato, and such it is even now.

Ralkes Currie presiding, the malnendation of the diectors to return 3W. per e out of capital, and topaya dividend of 10s. 9d. share, equal to about 6 per cent, per aunma unanimouslyagreed to. The report was generally rded-as satisiactory, but a ditlerence of opinion ex ressed as to whether the distribution should ie mnthe manner descnbed. It was explained the return of 3!. per share is coupled with the priation of a proportional amount of revenue ptal to supply the loses previously incurred, tht it is not considered necessary to keep it to per share, and that a repayment may with tage be made to reduce it to 151. With reto obtaining the supplemental charter, it is that no difficulties maybe interposd, although r ex;perience has tanght persons connected public companies the nature of the technical ions, enforced by Government departments. d, however, Mr. Lowe's measure be ultimately d, limited liability wi be asured without the *es.and stringentrequirements now entailed. directors, with a vie to economy, have dis- dof th city premise s of the company on adgeous terms, retaining a portion necessry for n$ business. The sale to a French company princinal vemels has not yet been combut there is every expectation that it will ybeso.

"The directors feel satisfaction in meeting their proprie. torn, and submnittin a report of the working of tSe corn. pany for the --yer ending in December last, which shows, that the favourable results thesy ventured to anticipate have beencompletelyrealized. Thelarge sumwhich stood to the debit of profit and les, as well as other debit balances not before taken to ccount, bave not cal been extinguished' thearnings f the est si moaths but the sum of 2S,63?,, paid to the proprietors as a dividend for the 31idsummer alf year, has been discharged, leaving a considerable surplus for present distibutio The direc. tov6, therefore, beieve thit the ncia affuirs of the corapany are now in u sound condition, the profit and less sheet showing a credit balance, after such large deductions for ascertained and estimated deficiencies as justify them in considering the capital of the company intact. The Continental service showrs an increase ints returns, and continues to give favourable promise of steadiy inproving trade. The Bos phorns and Propontis having both returned to Enzland in the course of the autumn, the directors were enabled to charter them at advantageous rates, and they are now in active employment in the East. The Sir Rlobert Peel is also discharging a similar engagement, to tho perfect satisfaction of her charte-ers. With reference to the vcsselswhich have been for so many months working under charter to the Govertmenrt, the directors have succeeded in concuding engagenients with iheTansportsad for their cntinar serhvce on fair terms. Since the close of the year, the di rectors have suceceeded in dsiposing of the house and promises in Cannon-street to the London and Eastern Bankin corporation for the sum of 15,000?., wshich leaves a hand.- some profit upon that investment. And the purchasers have, for the convenience of the company, agreed to let to them upon lease such portions of the premises as may be required for their present business. The insurance fund, which stood at 36,2.9ptothe 3Mth of June last, has been increased by the -risks since taken by the company to 457631. The reserve fund, to which the sum of 12,993 has been added, now amounts to 139,624?. In this satisfactory finania position,pursuing the policy which received the sanction of the shareholders in August last, the directors recommend that the amount of capital which is no longer required for the purposes of the company should be returned by a payment of 37. per share; while the surplus profits of the haf-year 3ustify them in also recommending a dividend, free of income-ta, at the rate of lOs. 9L. on each share of 18?., which is equl to about 6 per cent. per annum. " Having thus placed' before the proprietors a summary of their affairs to the close of the year, the directors have to add that, although they have kept steadily in view the expressed desire of the proprietors that their capital should be reaized by effecting satisfactory sales, no oppor.iity of carrying out such anoperationoffereditselfuntil averyrecent rod, when proposals were made by a French comipany for thr purchase of eight of the largest of the ships. To this proposal the directors gave their earnest attention, and thaey can now state that an agreement has been signed, which provides for the sale of the fofowing vessels :-The Jason, the Golden Fleeee, the Queen of the South, the Lady Jocelya, the Indiana, the Calcutta,the Hydaspes, and the Argo, uponz terms whch are considered satisfactory. The directors dO not at present enter more in detail into the conditions of this transaction, as, when the contract for the sale shall be perfected and the balance of the deposit-money paid over, they propose to call the proprietors together, and to take their nstractions upon the course to be adopted as to the future of the comuany, which it would. now be premature to discuss, the egil instraments necessary to bind both parties to the sale beig as yet incomplete, although a deposit has been paid over by the purchasers.

The appropriation from net revenue to the reserve fund has been augmented from 7* to 10 per cent. At a meeting of the Clarendon (Jamaica) Mfining Company held to-day the report and accounts, of vwhich anl abstract has already appeared in T7ie Times, were received as satisfactory. There was a meetingg of the East Indian Iron Company this afternoon, but a temporary adjournment took place, owing to unavoidable delay in the transmission of the annual accounts and reports from the chief manager in India. Great complaints aDpear to have been made at the meetinr of the Iasras R.ailway Company to-day, because the capital of the company had. been raised, under arrangements with the East India Company, at various rates of guaranteed interest. It is difficult to collect a clear representation of the facts from the observations which were made, but they are understood to be as follows :-The railway company, upon its formation in 1852, entered into an agreement with the East India Company for constructimg a short liue, to cost 500,0001. MIoney was then more plentiful than at present, and a guaranteed interest of 4- per cent. having been granted the shares immedLately commanded a premium of It. lOs. to 21. In the following year the East India Company resolved to extend the undertaking, and the railway company entered into a fresh contract to raise a further amount of 4,000,0001. upon the same terms. Circumstances have prevented the railway company from carrying this out, and the East lndia Company have from time to time increased the rate of guaranteed interest to enable them to raise capital as required, the rate being regulated by the stte of the money-market at the moment. Thus three denomntions of stock have been created-one with a. guarantee of . 4i, one with a guarantee of 4j, and one with a guarantee of. 5 per cent. per annum. The shareholders, it is stated, have memorialized the East India Company to raise the lower rates to the level of the hest, and the subject of complaint is, that their prayer has not been at once acceded to. As well might the Government be expected to improve the terms upon which fessrs. Rothschild may contract for the forthcoming loan, should the stock faL The shareholders, moreover, should bear in mind that they were parties tothe contract, and that it is to their interest, as wellasto that of the people of India, that the capital for the railway should be raised at a rate as low as possible.: The guarantee will have to be repaid; and, the lower the terms, the less will be the amonnt to re ultimatelydeducted from their profits when theseshal exceed the amount of the guarantee.- A voluminous report has jtut been issued by the Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company, preparatory to their meeting on the 25th. The future prospects of the concern appear to depend mainly on the results of an agreement lately made with a Mlr. Stephen to undertake the management of a niineral station in Victoria, on the principle of being remunerated solely out 'of profits. The accounts show 3,1321. cash in England, 12,5092. cash and bills in the colony, and 17,54. in freehold property, kc., in the colony; ma;king the total assets 33,1871. The report of the English Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, issned preparatory to their meeting on the 27th, states the profit of the past half-year at 13,2011. The reserved fund has -been reduced from G,2171. to 1,6171. in consequence of debts to the amount of 4,600. tavingbeen writtenoff a bad.

ExEouoN Ksa t3IsAz.ra -The execnltioni *of Edonardo Abad, aZias BLntgardo Ahadis, for the murder of 3r. Fenton, an Englisbman, who was shot and robbed in the vicinity of Tarifa in April last, took place at Algesiras on the 9th inst. An accomplice, who witnessed the murder, was sentenced to be imprisoned for life. A large crowd waspresent,butbehavedwith great decorum. The scaffold was erected just outside the town, and on it were two chairs, opposite one another, and about six feet apart-ono for Ahad, who was to suffer, and the other for his accomplice, who was to witness the execution, and afterwards to be imprisoned for life. Some infantry were drawn up round the scaffold, and a few Lancers kept the space clear between the infantrv and the crowd. At 12 o'clock the culprits were brought from the gaol to the place of execution. They were mounted on donkeys and escorted by a guard of infantry, and preceded by drums playing a slow march. The accomplice, who rode the ftrt donkey, had nothing particular about hisdress, except that, in lieu of a hat, a redhandkerchief was tied on his head; whereas Abad ws dressed in a long black cloak with a black cowl over his head; the wrists of each were tied tosether, but not so tight as to prevent the hands being slightly used. On arriving inside the square formed by the Mitary, the accomplice, after being assisted to dismount by the executioner, mounted the scaf fold and seated himself in the chair appointed for him, and was immediately secured therein by the executioner by means of ropesround his arms and legs, an an iron colar round his throat was strapped to the post behind him. Abad ascended the scaffold soon after, and the crier then prcelaimed his sentence. Three priests accompaiedthe culprits, and one of them was engaged for nearly half an hour on the scaffold with Abad, the priest sittin, in the chair and Abad kgeeling athisfeet.Abad had a cigar in his mouth when he arived, and continued smoldng it at his devotions as long as it lasted. He seemed to pay very little attention to the priest, frequently looking about him, and apparentlv nodding to acquaitances in the crowd. Both the culprits partook of wineduringthis time; and, when Abad had finisbed his confessions, he came forward, and asked the peoplo topray forhis souL He said he was sorry for what he had done, and begged forgiveness of :ll those whom he had inured. He then sat down in the chair, and was secured by a rope -passed round his body to the back of the chair - other ropes fastened his ancles to the legs of the chair, and Kis arms to the arms of the chair -; and his hands were drawn down beweenhis knees by a rope passed under the seat of the chair. The iron collar was then adjusted on his throat, and a black handkerchief tied over his face. The executioner then stood behind him, grasping the iron rod which turns the screw; and, when the priest bad arrived at a certain ;oint in some prayer or creed he was repating, the hands oh the ececutioner went round like lightning, and the collar was drawn up to within a very little distance of the post. Death appear to be instantaneous, as not the slightest muotion of teboywlas viEible, which was no doubt prevented in a great measure by the manner in which the culprit is fastened anthe chair. After aminute or two the handkerchief ws removed from the face, which did not exhibit any evidences of a violent death, except that the tongue was hanging out of the mouth. The priest, who had confessed Abad, then harangued the crowd for abouit 10 ininutes, immediately after w-hich the accomplice was released from his ciair and taken back to gaol in the same anner as he came. -Three or four sentries wrerb posted to gurd the body, which was to. be left till sunset, and tben buried;* the soldiers were marched awsy, and t-he erowd, aft>er s8atiating themselves 'with gaig at the body quietly dispersd TsnI Lr~-x~POOL lpv ON S mo.-. the state, rent made by Mr. Roare at the Court of Common, Counci' on Tuesday, respecting the dues levied upon shipping at Iiverpool , did not app ear uite aceate isniu our re- ,ort Mr. Rowe said, that. the dues ,cpon shipping ane in 1852 by the Oorporation ot Liv erpool auounted ',o no less a sumt than 105.000!., and that they applied sco cerhain purposses only ;>,0{44., the remainder bemng, ',xpended for the ben.S Qf the rtepayers of the borougb,

BAILWAY INTELLWGENCE. LONDON AND BLAXWAT.T Ait the adjourned meeting of this company, held yesterday, to receive the result of tho poU demanded at the halfytearly meeting, on Tuesday, for the election of an auditor it was stated that 65 persons, holdinz 5,852 shares, and re- resenting 2,170 votes, were for thie election of Mr. G. erth 5b persons, holdng 7,631 shares, and representiug 2,290 shares, were for Mrr.

TF.e result wnas a majority of 119 votes in favour of Mfr. Whethamn. After tbe declaration of ths poll MEr. G. Smith handed in a protest, to the effect-that be (Mr. G. Smith) protested against Mr. C. Wetham being elected auditor of the company, on theground that he was also an auditor of the outh-Eastern Company, whose line competed with the Black-wll. Company for the Gravesend, Margate, and Rams. gate traffic. The meeting then separated. EAST LANCASlIRE. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yes. terday at Bury; Mr. Thomas Dugdale in the chair. The report stated that the receipts for the half-year showed an increase of 5,3651. over the corresponding period of 1854, the mileage having increased from 81A to U3 mnes, by the addition of the Clifton andManchester7and Southport railways. The gross receipts during the halfyear ending 31st of December amounted to 158,111. ; the working expenses to 75,9251.; the interest on loans and preference shares to 40,216_.,1eaving a balance of 41,9691. available for dividend. The directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 3A per cent. per annum, leaving 3,0961. to be carried to the reserve fund, which now amounted to 61,357. The total expenditure of c iital during the halfyear amounted to 20,2021. The capi account showed that v,853,392C. had been received, and 3,811,4211. expended, leaving a balance of 41,970Lr The CaAmrxlAr, in moving the adoption of the report and accounts, said, although the conduot, character, and morality of railway directors, as a body, had been openly impugned at public meetings, it vwas a source of pleasure to Im to nmeet the proprietors of this railway, cause he could confidently appelto them for their approval of the palcy of their board. (fess-, hear.) He cooud not say that he had no disappointment in not being able to present them w ith a larger dividend. The depressed state of trade in the 33ast ancashire district and the dearness of food had deprived them of a large revenue both in passengers and goods. The working expenses had increased during the last halfyear by 7,5011., as compared with the corresponding half of 1854 Locomotive charges had increased by 2,9451., principallythrough running 64,759 miles more than in 1854 Substantial repairs to locomotive engines had coat 1,1871., and the p rice of coke, oil, and tallow had been raised, thow'h thie amount per train per mile was about the same. CoacTileg charges had been increased by 1,1481. The accident at-Summerseat had increased the claims for compensation; but, notwithstanding the large goods traffic, the com pany bad paid considerably less for compensation in this department than in the last half of 1854. 3Merchandise cliare had increased by 1,035M., because the goods traffic had mncreased by 12,539 tons, or 1,63YL, and the coat of materials and labour had augmented. The increase of 270. in the general charges was chiefly occasioned by advertising the Southport competition, and the increase in rates and taxes of 7401. arose from the augmented poor-rates in the townships through which this line passed. In fixed charges there was a net increase of 1,337L, the principal addition being the interest on the new 41 per cent, stock; but since December, 1854, the fifths had been reduced from 6 to S per cent. The loans on mortgage renewed during the last halfyear amounted to 63,0001., rather more than half being at 4A per cent. and under, and in no case had morethan 4, been paid, the average rate now paid by this companv being 41. 5s. ld., or 73d. per cent. incase since June last. (Hear, hear.) This company was now at Peace, and had a friendly nterchange of traffic with dll neigbouring railways. (Applause.) MIr. lRILEY (director) seconded the motion. Mr. Rossoseexpressed himself perfectly convinced that no railway had better p rospects before it than this company. The resolution was then carrned unanimously, the retiring directors and auditor were re-electeA, dividends after th guaranteed rates were declared on the preferential stock, and after the rate of 33 per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock, payable on the 4th of March, and 2001. was voted from ihe revenue of the current year in aid of the company's benevolent fund. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairsman and the director. D1ThID)DAIK AND ENNIS3ILLET. The half-yearly report to be submitted at the meeting on the 25th inst. statesthat the receipts for thchalf-year end December 31, 1854, amomuted on 25milesto 7,000., or 101. lSs. per mile per week, and for the half-year ending December 31, 1855, on 35 miles, to 10,1491., or 1L?. 3s. per mile per week; increase on half-year for the additioeial10 miles was 3,1491,.being at the rate of 151. 15s. per mile per week for 20 weeks. At the former period the expenditure amounted to 4,729?., or 53 per cent., and for the past halfyert 3,721.2. or 47 per cent. of thereceipts.

MADRAS. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern, Xajor-General D. Sim in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in 27v, Times, was taken as read. The CILUR2S,YA-, in moving the adoption of the report, saed, the undertaking was in a satisfactory state as to its Uress, cost, and efficiency, although the me had not yet opened for traffic. Locomotives had passed over the railway foS a distance of (0 miles, and the works had not suffbred to anY extent from the monsoon. In Aunust last the Governor-General passed over 37 miles of the lhne, and on his return to Madras in November had p&ssed over60 miles. lis Lordship expressed himself highly gratified with the stato of the line, and the zeal and ability with which it had been coatructed in- so shortxa time. In regard to the a¢pplication to the East; India Company, to the effect that all tne shlares of the company should be plae npon the same footing, no answerhad been obtined. A deputation of diroctorS and,three or four influential shareholders had wite~i u,con the authorities for that purpose, iand represented tijair views,but hevas not sangine of the applcation weeang with succes Mr. W -seconded the motion, c. J. 3L PA -SOm drew attention toa pLtrgrpih intle report rescting the survey of a Itio from a point near Madras, which was intended ioprocood by w,y of Caddzoa to B24ry, &I tildIoC QUWad t 4 jUUtitOA with the ril- wAy from Bombay. HE thought tLer oughSt to cor(tote the railway they had -in hand be!ore ttey vozumenctA. another. They knew nothing of the traflic on any railway in In And they did mot know what trafe they would hare on their railway, which, lie believed. extended from sea to rse, and would be about 40() miles in length in a south-west direction. The proposed extension line would go in a north-west direction overa veryuilycossntry. If theyw ere to make another nil. way, thatwould notdomnorethanpayitsworkn-expense3 it would, be an inJury to them. They should therefore b careful not to male lies that might prove uremunerative. The East India Company had for many years ress th, maling of even a single mile of raiway m lndia, they had since guaranteed the expenditure of 16.000,00l!. on about 2,000 tmiles of railway in India, and, like all large bodies when put in motion, it was now impossible to stop them. He concluded by moving a resolution to tho effect that it was not desirable to extend the engagements of the company until one-fourth of their present undertaking was opened for traffc and the result ascertained. The CHIW explained that it was merely the Surrey of the line to Cuddapa, andthat a separate account of the expense would be kept. The expense would be repaid by the party who might make the line Captain BARBEn thought they had better let some one else make the new line, and not increase their liabilities. A long discussion ensued as to the expediency of having A uniform rate of interest guaranteed on tho shares of the company, either 41 or 5 per cent., instead of 4.1, 5, and 4i per cent., as at present. It was stated that the originat capital was guaranteed 4.1 percent., and when first issued the shires were M. 21. anxi 31. premium. The Government had since modified the terms, so that a higher rate would be allowed on the remainder of the capital provided it could not be raised at 4.1 per cent. They were not bound to supply the cspital at 41 per cent., but only at such a rate as it could be rased. The report ans then received and adopted. br. PA1nsoxs then brought forward his motion; his object bein- to prevent the compny entering into new engagements before they had fulflled those in hand. Mjor Couwr thought it would be very imprudent to come toa resolution of that sort; and sxid it would be much better to leave the matter in the hands of the director. On the suggestion of the CnArcasMA, Mr. Parsons ageed to modify the motion to the effect that it waa not desible to enter into liabilities for a new line without the consent of a general misting of shareholders. The motion was then put and carried, as was also one proposed by Captain JoHIs:roa-, to the effect that the meeting approved of what the directors had done with respect to endeavouring to obtain a uniform rate of interest on all the shares of the company, and requestig them to urge the iratter when any opportunity should occur. The retiring directors, Mr. J. £ Arhuthuot, General P. Cannon, and Colonel M. C. Chase, wrere re-elected, as was as, Mr. P. F. Eobertson, the retiring auditor. Mr. lMorton was elected an auditor of the company. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thwans to the chairman and directors. RAILWAY BMTtS IN PARLIAMENT. Coam m YOUGnLL.-The directors, in their fian. cial declaration to Parliament, state that they intend to defray the cost of their extension-works out of moneys they are already authorized to raise by previous acts, which fixed their share capital at 375,0001., and the loan camital at 125,000!., andwshich also enabled them to raise 50,000. additional capitalby shares, antd 16,0001. by loan;- and they declare thnt, of the 566,000l., after deducting what will be required for other works, there will remain 100,000!. appli-. cable to the proposed extension sand workas.

The report stated that during the six months ending 31st of December last the number of messages amounted to 26,430, and the receipta to 10,001?. The directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum. They also recommended a deduction of 10 per cent. in future from the net receipts for the reserve fund, instead of 71 per cent., at present charged. The capital account showed that 86,307. had been expended. Resolutions vrere passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum for the half3 ear, payable on the bst of March; and increasng the deduc. tion from net revenue to 10 per cent. for the reserve fund.

On the motionrof the MLarquis of Br.,axFORD, this bill 'was read a second time. On the motion of Sir G. GRiEY, the bill was ordered to lbs referred to the Select Committee on the Ecclesiastical commnis3ion M3EDICAL PROFESSION BILL. Mr. HEADLAM moved that this bill be read a second time, with a vievr tobeing referred to a select committee. Lord R. GROSVENOR said that by this bill no medical znan would be able to recover costs of medical attendance uinless his name was on the register, and the bil also pro,vided that no person could hold an office in any public capa-city, or in aLnyihospithl or infirmary, unless his name was aipon the register. Every medical man must belong to some College, which badpowerto strike his name off the register. !5he bill thus gave a monopoly to the members of these colleges. It was all very well in the lawto say that none tut barristers and solicitors should practise, because law VMs an exact scince compared with medicine. A recent case occurred in Ediburgh, where an examining body relused adinloma to a gentleman, otherwise qualified, because ie refusedL to promise not to practise homreopathy. Now, the House ought to be aware that at this moment several hundred educated medical practitioners were practising 3homceopathy in-thiscountry whowereashonest, assdlentific, -and more successful than the others (a laugh), but who aeould hereafter be liable to have their names strack out of 'the regster at the diclum of these bodies. The state of medical science in this country would not justify the 3Mouse in giving them such lar"e powers. One of the greatest writers on medicine, ir. Forbes, said that the present state of medicine in this count-r re- qired complete and entire revision. Yet by this bill it wan proposed to give the medical'bodies a complete and entire monopoly of practice. Dr. Chambers, a distinguished physician, spealungof Dr. Willia toan astonished auditory, said that Dr. Williams "had no confidence in medicine." It vns said of another distinguished physician that, at the close of his life, he used to declare he could not tel whether he had done more harm ofrgood byhis prescrip-tions. During the cholera season a commission was appointed to examine the Pregress and treatment of choleram the metropolis. One of the commis3ioners thonght it his duty to examine the Homo oathic Hospital in Golden-square. No one was more strooghy prejudiced against homceopathy th3n this gentleman. He saw the treatment; h-said that all the cases were cases of real cholera, and he declared that the treatment was the most successful of any that he saw, and that if he had the disease, it was tothe treatmnentofthishospital that he shonld recur. (Eear.) Before the House consented to give such powers as this bill conferred, it bught carefully to consider whether great inestice might not be done to duly educated practitioners, and whether some nodiflcntion of the clauses would not be necessary. (Hear, l,ear.) Sir G. G=EY agreed with his noble friend that some of the clauses of this bill required very careful and attentive consideration. His noble friend did not appear to deny that' some security ought to be taken for the examination of medical practitioners and the registration of those who were duly qualfied; but as to the composition of the council and the mode of its election differences of opinion might exist wfhich might be fairly urged before the committee. The power of stil.Wing off a medical practitioner wthout soime liberty of appea might also be a proper subject of consideration. Hli noble friend said-that these anedical bodies would be able to interfere with those who practised hmwopathy, but he doubted whether they could interfere if a particular course of treatment were found to beattendedwith beneficalresults Securitysotghttobetalcen against the capricious removal of any redical man from the register, and it was right that due caution shouldbe taken aainst the undue exercise of power bythe medical authorities. The bill had been circulated amongthe professionduring thie receas, and although it could not be said there was a generalagreementnthe detail, yet there was a greater approach to an agreement than upon any bill that had yet 7eon submitted to the HIouse. He should therefore Sulp. port the second din. Mrn HENLEY said that, remembering the improvementg that had taken place in medical treatment, and the manner in which the older branches of the profession had set their faces against modern improvements, he thought it a dangerous power to enable the medical colleges to strike off a mans name for anything so indefinite as " mis- condu=t," whick might be immoral conduct or mere nedical treatmnent. Hlehad no sympthy with homcsopathy ess upon the prinIple that the less of a bad thing you took the better - a lauhi), but he hoped care would be taken that there asould be no interfereace with that freedom ot practice which had hitherto been permitted in this country. ear, hear.) At the sme time it was right that persons should not be letoose to ractise without a certificate that they had been properly educated for the medical professon. ltr.

On the Otion for going into commi,tee on this bill, M fr. WILlMS eplained that no proper exLISUM e had been givex of ita pro'siona, He did aot und :ataA& whether power s tobe taken by it toadvanee 21 more irroeyfor the drainage of Lind. The Houseba already voted 3000,OOL -to the landowners of -Great Britain and Ireland for the drainage of land, and the country had lost by thesa loans as the interest chrged was no greater than thatborae 'by Exheuer-bill. 3Mr.WILSON said, the hon. member was mistaken in supposing that the interest charged on these loans was at the rate of that of the Exchequer-bills of the day. The act provided that the rates of interest charged upon all loans should bh 5 Per cent. ;but power was given to the Treasury to reduce it Com ti..eto time to a rate not lower than that borne by the Exchequer bills of the da Fort he last three years, however, the Treasury had act upon the principle of grntin' no loans at a lower rate than 5. per cent The object of this bill was twofold. At the present moment, supposing that the Drainage Commissioners obtained authoUityfromtheTreasunytograltaloanof2, 0001. toa land owner,d they were obliged to come to the Teseury for fresh authority Eor each instalment of it which they wssued, and it was proposed by the bill that, authority havnDg been once obtained for-the hole loan, the co=mmioners might issue each instalment without further applietion. Under the present las, too, a - landowner kho obtained a loan only paid interest upon ach inaaolnment as he drew it from t hcaek, not wrhen he received the check- w;hile the DrinageCemssioners. on the other hand, having once signed the check, were obliged to considier the money as appropriated, and could make no further use of it. This bilf provided that interest should accrue from the time when the chedck Was drawn. Mr. HENLEY thought that the bill, instead of being a boon to the landed interestT rather put the -screw-upon them. (Hear, hear.) No doubt it was a great convenience to landowners to have these loans, but at the same timethey had always paid a Iarger rate of interest upon them thzn the Government paid upon Exchequer-bills. With regard to the second object of the bill, he quite agreed that the commissioners eought to receive interest on the instalments from the moment they issued thexi. Mr. WILIAMS said, the hon. Secretary woull find that the act of Parliament had imposed an interest of 6& per cent. ori these loans. Mr. WILSON acknowledged that he was mistaken in his fonner statement, and that the rate of interest mentioned in the act was not 5 but 6.1 per cent. The bill then passed through committee. The TenantW Compensation (Ireland) Bill was brought in by Mtr. G. HL MooRn, and read a first time. The House adjourned at 10 minutes past 1 o'cloek. .' We are requested by M r. D.

EASTEBR COMMZES RBALWAY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIEES. Sir,-As the contest for appointig a fit and trustworthy chairman for the Eastern Counties line iraws near, you may easily suppose what anxiety all shareholders who really think about the matter must feel in the result. There are some, indeed, who, not content with what has been done, are yet afraid to take any active steps to remedy past evils. They are apparently influenced by Hamletns fancy, and would rather "bear the ills they have" than incur the risk of "others that they know not of." But there is not anything mysterious in the future of a new and honest direction, or any unknown evils threatened by its appointment. Such persons, without trusting Mr. Waddington at all, may yet re-elect him. Do allow me sufficient space in your columnstoeafltheirattentionto some facts. A Government officer has recently made a report, calling attention to the dangerous state of many of the works on the Eastern Counties line, and declaring that large sums wll be required to put the defective parts into sound working order. lr. Waddington'sparty, feeling that this is a sore reproach and dangerous disclosure as to past mismanagement, wil not admit the correctness of the report. Do MIr. Waddington and his friends forget-if so, let theshareholdersrememberthat so long ago as February, 18555, IMr. Bruff, the directors' own engineer, addressed to them a report in which he set forth the defective state of the "road and works," condemned the "small sms expended on substantial relpairs" the " waint of attention to the general upholding of the road and works," in consequence of which "some entire new stractures will have to be erected, or unusually expensive repairs undertaker," and censured the "palliative which onlydeferredfor a short time an indispensable expenditure?' let me alo recall to the attention of the shareholders the fact that, at "the request of the chairman," whe no doubt wanted to soften down this report of 3fr. Bruff, or, perhaps, to discredit it altogether, an examnation WAS instituted by Mr. Hawrkshaw, another engineer, but that thisgentleman,-so far from diacrediting the report of his predecessor, substantially confirmed it (Report dated July, l85), and felt himself called on to read a knd of railway economical lecture to the directors, assuring them that it was " ultimate economy to keep ths way and stock and other workl;ig parts of a railway in the best state of repair and efiiency.' Tnis sensible advice the re rt o£ the Government of cer shows they must have ne d. At the same time the moneyct the ahareholdershanot beeS spared.

LONDON, THUBSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 18. In the House of Commons yesterday, the Episcopal and Capitular Estates Bill was read a second time, and referred to the Select Committee on the Ecclesiastical Commission. On the order for the second reading of the Mledical Profession Bil, Lorid R. G NoSVrO objected to certain provisions of the bill, which, he said, would create a monopoly of practice, to the exclusion of homceopathic practitioners, and insisted that, before the F egave such large powers to a medical body, securities should be provided for their imp~arEial exercise. He did not oppose the second reading of the bill. SirfG. GRsn agreed with Lord ROBEaT that some clauses in the bill required very careful considertion in conmittee, and that precautions shoulld be ,taken to prevent arbitrary exclusions; but he hoped the House would read the bill a second time. After a rhort conversation, in which Mr. H3uE5y, hIr. NAPm, and Mr. HPDnAx participated, the nbiil was read a second time. The Drainage Advances Acts Amendment Bil passed through committee, afteran explsnation of its objects by MIr. WIsowN, in reply to Mr. W. Wu, LIAMs and MIr. HEN=. The House adjourned at 10 minutes past 1 o'clock.
There are ponds which Will bear drawing about -Ionce;in five years, and the proces is very exciting. That is.about the interval at' whichthe British public will bear a good brisk agitaion. The crop is rather an exhausting one, but the oil -is-generous, and.will-bear it. without_utter-dexolation. Not to commit -ourselves. to the -opiniorn that the object has always been in proportion to the zeal with which it has been prosecuted, ie must confess that tho old adage of "g9reat cry and "' little woor' is fulfilled ina the present instance. Here is nearly the whole pbpulation of this isle, the church of England, andall the sects,-forthey are many,-towns, parishes, chapelries, congregations, schools, presbyteries, stewartries, associations, vicars, churchwardens, office-bearers, teachers, a whole colulmn of them in our yesterday's paper alone,-sending earnest petitions to Parliament not to allow the opening of the Crystal Palace, the' National Gallery, or the British Museum on the Lord's-day. Sometimes, indeed, the prayer goes to silence. the band in Hyde Park, and stop everything in the nature of amusement on the Sabbath. The resolutions adopted andthe speeches applauded at public meetings go very much further. Strong' men, able to walk their five miles an hour, forbid invalid ladies an hour's airing in a.carriage; and men with home, wife, and children, and warm friends besides, forbid the moping bachelor his newspaper and his club. There is no end to the burdens and prohibitions which a certain sort of zeal will lay upon t'nose who are or may be the least able:to bear them, and who are the objects for grace rather than law. No doubt it is very amuasmg to hunt down the poor creatures who try to find a little -amusement somewhere between the necessity of labour and the obligation of " rest." No doubt gentlemen who are prevented by the decencies of their profession, or by a regard to appearances; from hunting any other description of vermin, find some equivalent in the chase of a Sabbath-breaker through all his places of r'!"ort. It is great and noble sport to scent him. as he is listening to a band in H3yde Park, to head him on his way to Pall-mall, and run him down as he is entering the Waterloo-station. No doubt, too, that preachers find the amusement very cheap. Sunday is their working day, generally their only one, and they can afford to rest salvation in doing nothing else in it but what they are paid to do. As, too, they are preparing their sermons on Saturday evening, they can throw it into the bargain, and denounce Saturday evening parties without losing much by it. Nevertheless, there are people, not wholly destitute of religion, who are apt to suspect a cheap and noisy goodness. It wants the mark of sterling virtue, which, though bold and strenuous, is usually quiet. The greatest of preachers, in the presence of his largest congregation, began a long discourse with warning his paxticular friends to " beware " of hypocrisy." So we cannot be very far wrong when we warn people in general to distrust a cras tde of which they enjoy the excitement, leaving the difficulty, the cost, and the burden to others. As to the particular instances of Sabbath desecration on which the ran is now made, they seem to us hardly to deserve so much A" good indigna" tion." They seem amenable rather to a quiet discussion on their respective merits. As to the Crystal Palace,-why, may we not walk in a private garden on Sunday? If in a private garden, why not in a public garden I If in a garden out of doors, wly not in a garden under cover? If a vast conservatory is not too like Paradise, or another place, why may it not comprise ornaments of an artistic, scientific, andc historical interest? Why' may not a 'man, woman, or child have tea and toast, or caLe and wine, or bread and cheese and 'beer, 'in such a pl tce, if nature requires it? If you cannot have it next door, why may you not go a " Sabbath " day's jouney" to it-that is, a mile on foot, or ten miles by rail? No doubt some sort of answer may be made to these questions, but they ought to be quiet, reasonable, special answers-not howled or screamed, but in a conversational tone and articulate utterance. If the answer merely means that his Lordship may go down to his seat on Saturday, stroll about his grounds half Sunday, and return -to his house in town on Monday afternoon, while the* artisan, after leaving off work at -8 on Saturday evening, is to confine himself, his wife, and children, the whole of the Sunday to the pavement between Stinkpool-court and Bethesda Chapel, and return to his work at 7 on MIonday morning, then we beg to decline any further attention to -the answer. We have not time or heart for him who gives it. To us it seems a very open question, resting rather on a comparison of conveniences and inconve- niences than on any law from the Mount of Fire.] If the British public and if Parliament come to the conclusion that the working classes may lawfully do what all Parliament-men do themselves, but that, on the whole, the Crystal Palace does not supply the best possible opportunity, then this legion of petitioners would do well to affix their cheap signatures to a charitable prayer -that Parliameat would give the common people public walks and gardens, adorned with works of GoD, offering necessary refreshment, and so near as not to require that even a horse or a servant, much less a locomotive, should have to break the fourth commandment. Certainly the Crystal Palace is open to fair objections. For example, its statuary has on the whole a sadly Pagan character. But that might easily be mended. As to the British MIuseum, we suspect that the great bulk of the country petitioners have not the slightest notion what sort of a place it is. Certainly it is not a place of " rest." Nothing takes the strength out of a man so much as a walk through those long, dose, crowded- galleries. You return home with weary limbs, a stiff neck, aching eyes, and nothing left in your brain but a sort of dust-haze of stuffel beasts, Egyptian idols, mummies, and fossil bones. Few artisans, we should think, go there more than once in their lives, and we should advise them, for their own sakes, to wait till they can go there on Saturday, and then rest well on the Sunday, just as they would after a strong dose of physic or a walk to Barnet and back.- The principle, then, of opening the British Mluseumon Sunday we feel we are hardly competent to canvass when we confess we -are the last to recomMend the practice. As for the National Gallery, seeing that we do not admit pictures into our churches, it would be but'reasonable to let people see them somewhere else. A A speaker at Exeterhall, indeed, asked, "if ever a. man was made " virtuous by looLing at pictures." This is a-hard test. Few'men are made virtuous by anything in particular, :or even by all things together. : But, if we put pictures into our nurseries aud schools, and illustrate the Bible with pictures, why not let them be seen on-Siinday? It is true, -as this sPeaker said, they teach nothing to the mnan whose mind has not been previously prepared by: education; but 'this is. a reason for preparing. men's minds by education, not for shutting them out of picturegalleries. .Nothing remains but the band. in Hyde Parki That, however, -is in the same boat with the band on Windsor-terraee,- which wD believe to. be well able to defend itself. ' ' What is most to be feared from this iort of movement is the encouragement it gives to a dull, tyrannical and'prohibitory religion. It is. the " touch not, taste not, handle- not," and -we may also add; the "see not, heai nxot know not, move " not, do not, old superstition stillamong us. Itreminds one of the dullppere,t, 'Dr theharlesmWe -c- nary schooliaster, who can only just screwich or thunder out-" Doe't do thisri and "Don?'t d'othat "- till:the mental caondition of the child oM the puTil; is that of a -Wild beast in a cage.

We cannot do this. We must ha-e more sympathy with people, epecially the large mass that requires a little comfort, and even indulgence. We" are bound to consider not jnst what they ought not to do on Sunday, but what they do, and what they may do. We are bound also to institute some sort of comparison. Is it better an arti'an should spend the long hours of a summer Sabbath in i publichouse, or simply basking in the sun, or dozing in the shade, torpid and sullen, than with Lis wife and children, and very many other men, wives, and children, in a beautiful garden, breath- ing sweet air, and gazing on a glorious landscape!Cannot a little charitable contrivance enable him to do this without robbing other men of all their Sunday rest t Thousands upon thousands spend their Sunday evenings in " tea-gardens," where they have scarcely standing-room, where they drinLbeer and spirits, breathe tobacco, and whatever other perfumes a great crowd brings with it. For our part, we donet think the custom so utterly icious and the people so cc accursed " as to interposo a couscientlaus scruple against our so mucx as trying to improve it. Of cmurse, it takes only a dro1 of ink Lnd a strokle of the pen to pronounce any poor creature who gets into a boat or an omnibus on the Sunday afternoon " a child '"of perdition," and have - nothing more to da with him. This is not the way to make anybody better. It has made many a bad man, and many a hypocrite; but it tells nothing, teaches nothing, and comes to nothing but darkness aud bondage of body and clouL No doubt all people could spend the Sunday much better thAn they do. In private society it is a high and precious gift to be able and ready to guide a Sunday evening's conversation to the holy purposes of the day. But this is only to be done by initiating, suggesting, and supplying thb topics. It is not to be done by throwing a wet blauket on every spark- of wit, or burst of feeling, or natural expression that may break through the tedium of the day. So we thinE these good people who are telling our legislators how to deal with the Sabbath had better direct their attention to some positive and practical way of enjoying GoD's rest, instead of merely banning us from this and from that. In fact, the people will not be dealt with in this way. They want instruction and elevation, and a great deal more; but it's of no use to lay down a number of justice-laws, and send below every man who does not observe them.
Lord DBBBy has given notice for to-night of a question w-ith reference to the limits which separate the duties of Commander-in-Chief from those of Secretary-of-War, and the paper of the House bf Commons is fuU of notices and questions on the same subject. On that subject public attention is riveted, and the appearance of the new Army Estimates yet more forcibly points out the anomalies of our present position. We have accumulated under the 3linister-of-War departments involving the expenditure of 35,000,0001. Ia this enormous list appears the modest item of 22,0007. for "Head-Quarters, ElitaryDepartment,"-a title not very easily distinguished by unprofessional eyes from that of the War Department itself. Yet, while the M1inister-of-War is intrusted with the expenditure of this vast sum of money, the patronage incidental to it is kept at Head-Qu3rters, supreme inthisrespect, though passed over as of little account in everything else. We put it seriously to Ministers that they should attentively consider this state of things, so absurd intheory,so detrimental in practice, and decide whether such a division ought any longer to be maintained. In all other departments of the public service it is, and is likely to continue the rule, that patronage should go along with the ordinary powers of administration. The Governor-General of India would, by general confession, be incapable of discharging the onerous duties cast upon him if his position were not maintained and his power consolidated by placing in his hands thepatronageof everylucrative and important office. The Board of Admiralty would lose its control over the service, and be utterly inefficient for the discharge of its duties, were it not that from the Board of Admiralty every naval officer must look for his promotion. Favouritism thereis, no doubt, but, upon the whole, it will scarcely be denied that efficiency is far better cared for and public opinion much more attended to in the one service than in the other. Why, then, should the Army alone present the strange anomaly of two departments-. one framed to administer the patronage, the other to transact the business and manage the finance It is to be feared the public mind has not yet become accustomed to the enormous change implied in that single monosyllable which has converted the Secretary-at-War into the Secretary-for-War. In the days of the Secretary-at-War the Commanderin-Chief was at the head not only of the army, but of the general military administration. The duties of the Secretary-aP-Var were limited to a moderate financial control, and the great bulk of the business was transacted at the Horse Guards oy the military chief. It was not unreasonable that the offzcer of the hi,ghest rank should also exercise the highest powers, and the patronage was at least as appropriate to the position of Commanderin-Chief as to that of Secretary-at-War or MasterGeneral of the Ordnance. But now it is perfectly manifest that if the position of the Minister of War is to be maintained, if the predominance of the civil power over the military is to be duly asserted-if, in-fact, the department is to work, the patronage must be reposed in those hands to which the rest of the duties are confided. We have already seen enoagh of the workin, of the new system to know that it is beginning to produce those effects which appear to be inseparable from double and divided government. The civil and military elements will not coalesce, and cannot be trusted for any long period of tima to work harmoniously together. They look, imdeed, to different standards of public opinion, and regulate their conduct by different feelingsand objects. The Commander-in-Chief beingplace&more immediately nader the control of the SOSETGX, and withdrawn fr Parliamentary respoaslity, forms a sort of CDnnecting link between the Court and the public service, sad natuzally looks more to the Vaowx,r whos seirant he~ is, than-to the popular a2ssembly which is privilvea to remunerate, baet not to control his activss Next to the Couxtl he naturally looks to tha feelings and prejudices o f tlie profession of -which he is the head, and - forms, indeed, a. nucleus round .whch ithey gather more -:dense <and: mora ie,nse then: elsewhere. ithe adiuitton -f sach n offliceris in its very nature inti-popular, ud t onaducted more or less upnDi the principle of i despisrg tboe popularmfluencos from which he is ;&complotely 3xelieved.

hIr. tIeCxz-.NoX on Tuesday night proposed a !Solution of the most difficult of al our social I)roblems-that is, the relation between MIasters ,IndaWorkimen. This is the stumbling-block of -our times. Wars will wear themselves out. In Some f.ishion or other we shel always manage to 4lisposo of a political question or a poEtical embarrassment, but who is to maintain peace between the various sections of the community? There is a strong resemblance between the body politic in Tiodern times and the physical structure of any -one among us. We see a m-an walking about the streets in apparent enjoyment of healthl; he -man leap, ride, run, swim-in fact, do anything irhiclh mav be required of a perfect physical organization. Who takes account of the wonderful play -of veins and arteries, of muscles and nerves, and of the many chymical and mechanical conditions requfsite for the preservation of healthy life? It is the .-une with the conditions of the political existence of s nation such as ours. W'ho thinks of the ranga of Irices, of the demand for labour, of the provident *ssociations, of the savings-banks, and of the various -other expedients which foresight and experience S.ave provided for the relief of the labouring classes in hard times? We are speaking of no less a 3natter than the relations between the 24,000,000 -of people in these islands who possess nothing but their capacity for labour and the 3,000,000 of jersons who are in a condition to afford them scope for their exertions. By the side of a problem like -this mere political questions sink into insignificance. ;Vhen the French Revolution of 1848 astonished the nations of Europe what was the real difficulty? It was not so much that the nation was em-' 1)rrassed to choose betwen this and that form of government as that the vast m.ajority of the Yrench people entertained doubts as to the real theory of property. In a word, the hesitation was Isetween Socialism and order-between masters -end -workmen. The same class of questions has been mooted in our country from time to time, but :.t has been discussed in the presence of a -powerfil Government and of an overpowering -public opinion. TIe classes who were prepared to secede to this Aventine-the artisans, the minng and manufacturing workpeople-could not close -their eyes to the truth that the agricultural labourers were not with them either in theory -or in fact. The strike of any section was but a partial mutiny, and a mutiny has never yet sue-ceeded, unless it were a general one. Stil the result -of these strikes has been very lamentabIe. No one who is not intimately acquaintedwith the history of -our manufacturing population can at all appreciate -the vast amount of misery and sufferingawhich foLows upon a single strike. Not only are the seceders reduced to dire distress, but the members of the -same trade who remain in work are taxed for the maintenance of the mutineers. The little hoards -of these are soon exhausted, the deposits are drawn from the savings-banks, articles of furniture, and then cf clothing, are taken to the pawn.shop; sickness creeps in; and, finally, under the pinch of stem necessity, with famnished stomachs -nd burning hearts, the poor creatures return to .their work, but with the determination of rising once more into resistance upon the first oppor-tunity. Strike follows strike, because nobody is ;content. There is suspicion on one side, indignation on the other, and the temporary cessation of hostilii.cs is rather a breathing-time than a reconciliation-a truce, not a peace. Now, what remedy can be devised for this diffi-cult- ? Will law touch it ? No. Any man who zhould propose to fix by positive edict the price of 1abour in any trade would be a fit subject for Bedlam. No Parliament, no conclave, can determnine Ihow much the cottonspinner, the miner, the hardware artisan, the printer, should receive. His Temuncration must dependapartly uponthe call for his exertions in the general market of the world <and partly upon the supply of labour in his periicular dep3rtment when the demand makes itself felt. This is, no doubt, the sound general rule, but if wve attempt to dea with men as with algebraic zymbols or with packets of merchandise we shall surely involve ourselves in a series of calai-ities in the form of strikes, or some othee rebellion of human nature against formsule. You cannot deal with a man as with the characters x+ij or with a bale of cotton; the soul and spirit within him will start up and blow .yonr calculations to shivers. Deal with him, however, as with a man, and wiser counsels will pre-vail. It is not amonlg the labouringr classes that you meet with morbid feelings or idle repinings -against Paovmsn:Cx Show them that the calani-ties under which they may be labouring for a time aire not the result of man's injustice or of wanton oprrcssion, and they wi resign themselves in mnoat cases to suffering and want in a quiet spirit of cndttrance which would astonish those who have 'been trained to regard misery as an extraordinary mnatter. It is, however, necessary,-it is bare justice to eal -with them in such a manner. We must consider thieir trials-we must consider their temptations. If on the one side the master stands aloof, on the other, the sharp, busy, demagogue,-the GItAccurs of the mine and the loom, who lives by }is glib tongue and k-een wit, as the miner and the sutisan live by the sweat of their brows and their honicst industr,-is ever at handto suggest discontent, to prompt them to resistance, to whisper of success if they will be but resolute and flrm. In an evil hour they listen to his words,-an organization is formed, suitable agents are enlisted, and every agent is a salaried devotee of the feud; passions ae kindled, pride is aroused, and the artisans point oE ionour i ia- s . ._ ~ I . volted in his contest wmith his employer. From that nioment farewell to all' hopes of a cessation of hostilities until the workman has drained ! the cup of bitterness to its very dregs, and is'fairly driven back toihis work, with its acrid favour upon .bis pale lips! Nor, on the other side, is the conqueror in this umnatural strife, the master, to be envied. 'He has triumphed, it is true; but at what a price ! 'The artisans in his employment are in his eyesbut as so many pieces of treacherous machinery, which will fly from under his hand when their scrvices are needed the most. It is his business to exact from them all the toil which they can give at the lowest possible rate of remuneration, to be ever peovided against the natural contingency of their revolt, and to live in a state of eternal suspicion sgainst the very men who are the foundation of his fortunes. It is to the solution of this difficult question that Mr. 3ACKrsDNoN has- addressed himself. He repudiates, of course, the folly of establishing tribunals which are to fz a matximum rate of wages. He asks for the establishment of some bodies which may break the absolute shock between masters and workmen. The definite form of his motion on Tuesday night was this:-"That a Select Committee be appointed "to inquire into and consider the propriety of "establishing equitable tribunals for the amicable "adjustment of differences between masters and ["workmen." His idea seems to be,-and in nine cases out of ten it is a perfectly just one,-that if, when discontent first assumes the form of words and incipient action, the masters and their workmen, or the deputies who represent them, could 'b brought together to discuss their differences in a spirit of conciliation, anything. i;ke a definite rupture and the tremendous calamity of a strike would be avoided. It is so highly the interest of both parties to come to an agreement that it would be strange indeed if the elements of discord were not soon eliminated from any such discussion. The prosperity of the manufacturer is involved on the one hand, the existence of the workman on the other. Bankruptcy or starvation is the penalty of unreasonable pertinacity on either side. The idea is not altogether a novel one, as we had occasion to show on the occurrence of the recent strikes. It is in the carpet trade, if we remember right, that an organization of this kind actually exists, and has been attended vvith the most beneficial results-in fact, with the entire extirpation of anything hlke serious disputes. The success, howover,. of such a measure as this must entirely depend upon the absolute abandonment by the mantifacturing labourers of the professional agitators who have generally taklen the lead in their contentions. They must never forget that these men profit by their miseries, become rich by the protraction of their sufferings, and sink once more into merited insignificance with returning peace.
In point of numbers the British army has never made a great show, and perhaps we are inclined even to underrate what numerical strength it can boast when comparing it with foreign armies. An army of a million or half a million seems an enorwous force comparedwith ours, even although alarge portion of it may not be a whit more effective than those auxiliary troops which we are in the habit of regarding as separate from the army. The Estimates just published inform us that the " total of H ixER MlAisTVs forces, including those in the "East Indies," amounts to 275,000; but, if we look at things instead of names, it wil be found that at this moment the British forces have attained to the dimensions of something like a Continental army. The regiments of which this immense m is composed are, no doubt, of the most 3nultifariouz origin, speech, and character; of most unequal merit, weight, discipline, and experience; receiving different degrees of paymnent, and honoured wiLth different degrees of rank. But so, also, are the regiments of Austria, of Russia; and, if we do not regard all alike, still it may be worth while to keep in mind the total numerical strength of our land armaments, which is much nearer half a miUion than a quarter of a miUlion. The embodied militia differ very little but in name, experience, and rank from the regular troops; their pay is not much inferior; their clothing for the ensuing year is to cost nearly as much as the clothing of the whole army during the past year-only about 12 per cent. less. It numbers 127,000; the Volunteer Corps numbers 14,500; the Army Works Corps amounts to 3,470. All these, togetherwith the regular army, amount to 420,000; and, if we had to state the entire forces employed in the British empire, it would be necessary to add 250,000 for the Indian army, maldng. a grand total of 670,000. Of the QuEIN's troops, however, 26,000 are in the pay of the East India Company, and 2,000 more are returned as noneffective; so that the military force for which the House of Commons is asked to provide amounts in al to 391,000 men, and for these the sum asked is 14,600,0001., or about S71. 10s. a-piece-this, of course, being exclusively pay. The pay of what is especially termed "Him MAsisr's, forces"' amounts to nearly 11,000,0001., or about 441. 1Os. a-piece. When we come to look stil further into items of pay, it will be fotmd that in the army the amount forfeited by men under sentence of courtsmartial was 3,0001.; while that forfeited by the militia, which numbers only half the army, and is not so well paid, was 2,0001. In like manner, it is calculated that the amount which in the ensuing year will not be issued for army men in confinement is 35,0001.; the amount not issued for militiamen (during the past year, we presume) is 23,0001. From which the conclpsion would seem to be that the army is better behaved than the militia. The whole sum deducted from the estimates for the bad conduct of the army is 36,0001., while the total of good-conduct pay is 92,3001. These estunates enter very minutely into every detail of the army, giving the same particulars in various forms-at one tune regimentally, at another time according to rank, from the Field-3Marshal Commanding-in-Chief to the smallest drummerboy. There are about 4,000 trumpeters, Luglers, fifers, pipers, and drummers in the army, besides about 150 trumpet, bugle, fife, pipe, and drun majors; The medical staff and the medical staff .corps ntumber 1,600. The charge for Divine service is, during the ensuing year, 50,0001., or 28,0001. more than last year. The British foreign corps costs 552,0001., and its general staff 20,0001. more. The total of staff pay and allowances during the following year is reckoned at 584,0001., or 200,0001. more than in the year which is about to expire. Of this increase 140,000l. goes to the staff of the army in the field, and of this, again, a very considerable proportion goes to the medical staff. To sum up all, the strength. of the army has been stated at 275,000, and if we deduct from this the regiments in the pay of the East India Company, also the Land Transport Corps and the Commissariat Staff, we obWain a total of 239,103 officers and men. Of this number, 8,282 are officers, and receive 1,493,8781. of - the public money; 16,527 are non-commissioned ofiicers, and receive 563,6281.; 214,294 are rank and file, and receive 4,221,0691. Let us now tlurn to those items which used to be clasified under the Conmulissariat and Ordnance Departments. The, clothing of the cavalry is to coat 20',0001., and of the infantry 714,0001. jdwing next year; while: laut year the cloiting Qf both tgogether - did -not amount to taore than 490,000!.. Besides which there is an item for summer clothing to the amount of 22,0001. whict does not appear in th¢ estimates of tho curent year. The clothing, too, for sick and wounded men was not taken into account in the last estimates; in the present ones it is put down at .5,0001. On the other hand, there is no such item in the present aecounts as boots and shoes for the armiy in the field, which this time last year vere estimated at 211,000l.; and the greatcoats, which last year cost 215,000Z., are in the coming year to cost the half of that' sum. Provisions are expected to cost 2,250,0001.; forage nearly 5,000,0001.; and fuel and light nearly 500,0001. Of course this enormous expense is chiefly incurred at the seat of war. The net cost for provisions at home is to be 30G,0001., while in the East it is reckoned at nearly 1,700,0001. So, the forage, which at home will cost 320,0001., at the seat of war will cost mere than ten times that sum. And the fuel and light, at home charged 128,0001., will be charged 220,0001. in the Crimea. There is a considerable difference, too, between the expenditure of the expiring and that of the commencing year, but this is chiefly observablo in the sum apportioned for forage. Last year at the seat of war 1,080,0001. was spent for the purchase of forage; next year nearly 3,500,0001. will be spent m this way. Of the very Large sum, amounting to more than two millions, demanded for new works and buildings, considerably more than a half goes to the formation and repair of barracks. The erection of militia huts absorbs 250,0001.; Woolwich absorbs 240,0001. more; and Aldershott gets another 240,0001. This is a large sum for Alldershott, and it does not express aR the demands which it makes, although in the meantime it must be regarded as a comparative failure. The design is excellent, for our troops require concentration, that they may learn to act together and practise movements on a large scale. The site also is admirable, but its principal advantages have been thrown away by the engineers to whom the drainage and other works have been intrusted. The drainage of the place has been so ill-managed that, though the I cost has been enormous, the mud is like that of Balaklava; the men can scarcely leave their huts, and the only drill that goes on in the few patches of comparatively dry groumd could be as well performed in a barrack-yard. The Government, we perceive, is to ask for 1,0001. more for the purpose of this drainage, and it is to be hoped that it will at last be thoroughly done. Woolwich does not call for especial remark. The largest item in the sum which it is to receive is 40,0001. for a newfoundry. It would seem that its Military Academy is almost self-supporting. The sum expended on it is 22,0001., while its receipts are 20,000l. The sum expended on the junior establishment at Carshalton is 5,5001., and its receipts are 7,0001. With regard to the non-effective service, it is not necessary to enter into much detail, and the grand totals were mentioned in our impression of yesterday. The most interesting columns are those which propose the rewards for distinguished services, where Sir RicsARD ARzy is appointed to receive his 1001., and General WnHAi his 100o. also, and where one is greatly puzzled to understand the principle of selection that guided the Minister-forWar-if, indeed, it is he who distributes these rewards.
THE PEACE CONFERENCES. (BY SUBMAlhUE AND BILMTS TSELEGRPE.) We have received the following telegraphic de spatch from our Berlin correponden-t "BERLN, WEDSRSD&Y, FE; 20. " Count Orloff had an audience yesterday of the King at Charlottenburg, and left this capifad this morning for Cologne, where he will sleep to-night."
We have reason to believe that a military conmmis. sion will be immediately appointed to institute a searching inquiry into the circmstances now so pronilnently before the public in connexion with the officers inculpated by the report of Sir John 'NeiUl and Colonel Tulloch.-v1obe. The Speak-er of the House of Commons will hold his levees at his house in Eaton-square, on Saturday, the 1st, and Saturday, the 8th of M5arch, each night at 10 o?clock. SARDrns1A LoAzv.-The total sums issued up to the 31st of December, 1855, oat of the consolidated fund, and advanced to His Majesty the King of Sardinia by virtue of the act of the 18th of Victoria, chap. 17, amount to 1,000,OCOt., of which half was advanced in May, and the other half in November, 1855. The sum of 2,5001. has been received from Sardinia on account of the sinkin fund at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum, leasing 997,500l. to be discharged. TiHE Guaxic LoAx.-The amount of moneys paid out of the consolidated fund in 1855 for the interest and sinking fumd of that part of the Greek Loan which is gnaranteed by England amounted to 47,4941., making a granid total of 598,7341. since I The Greek Government has repaid 31-0841., so that 567,6491. remains due. COmIST BuoL.-The following is a sketch of the services of the chief of the diplomatists who are to represent Austria at the conferences of Paris :-" Charles Ferdinand Count Buol-Schauenstein, of ReibeTg, Strassberg, and Enresfels, born on the 17th May, 1797, Chamberlain and Priqy Councillor of the Emperor Francis Joseph, Minister of Foreign Affairs, vc., is a descendant of one of the oldest families in Swvitzerland. He is a native of the canton of the Grisons, whvere two of his family have successively occupied the episcopal see of Coire. It was in the diplomatic school of his father, who was President of the Germanic Diet, that Count de BuoiL was brought up, and when scarcely 19 years of age he made his debut in the difficult career of diplomacy. After several minor appointments he was in 1822 promoted to the rank of Secretary of Embassy in Paris, where he remained until 1824, when he went as First Secretary to the Austrian Embassy in London. By a strange coincidence, Earon de Bourqneney and Prince Gortsch3koff were at that same period secretaries at the embassies of their respective Courts in London. Thirty years later the three secretaries met in the character of Pleni tentiaries at the Conferences of Vienna. Count Bual left England in 1828 for Carlsruhe, and afterwards served as Envoy at Darmstadt, Stuttgart, and Turin. Prince Felix de Schwarssnberg, who, in 1843, took in hand the reins of the Austrian Government, confided to Count fIol the direction of the Austrian Legation at St. Peter.hbnrg. At the conferences which took place at Dresden in the year 1850 for the settlement of the differ ences between Austria and Prusa Count Buol was appointed as second Plenipotentiary with Prince de Schwarzenberg. In the year 1851 he went to London as Minister Plenipotentiary of Austria, and, on the sudden death of Prince de Schwarrenberg, in 1852 was recalled to Vienna to succeed him in the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Costa having sold the copyright of his new oratorio, Eli, to Messrs. Addison and (o., of Regent-street, for 6001., has given the whole amount to the Committee of the Brmningham Festival, to he applied to the charitable purpoees forwhich the festival is carried on. He had already made shenme generous use of the sun which he received for the production of this oratorio at the fesival in Angust . RAiWAY AccirDEN T.-A collision between a passenger train and a coke train took place at Hudderflield esation on 31onday afternoon. A down passenger train, from MatkchestertoLeeds,wascrossingthe up line at theowmal points, to draw up against the platform, when a coke train on the up line ran into it. The concussion was violent, the passenger train was driven back some distance, and the passengers got out in great alarm, but without any further injuries than a few superficial bruises. The stoker of the coke train was, however, severely wounded inhis6left fo3t, ard had to be conveyed to the infirmary, Another engine was got outto forward the trainto Leed5, and the paaseagers1 proceeded on their journey after a short delay. POST-OFiECE ROBBEBYv AT BsssoL.-At the Bristol Police-court yesterday Comelius Crowley, one of the letter-stampers, was charged with stealing a letter conLtaining money, the property of Her Majesty's PostmasterGeneral. It appeared that, in consequence of money letters having been missed, inquiries were instituted, which resultedin suspicions bemg aroused as to the prisoner. It was then resolved to test his honesty, and a " traV1 letter was prepared by order of the Postmaster, in which was placed a mxrked sixpence and four marked postage-stamps,.

miLiTARY FLOWEBRS OF .HETORrC. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The readers of despatches from the Crimea who complained, and with some reason, of the poor and spiritless accounts furnished by General Simpson-sometimes scarcely grammatical, never elegant, and much less imaginativemust be delighted at the picturesque and poetic style of the present gallant commander, whose despatch on the blowing up Fort of St. Nicholas appears in your paper of this day. In the eighth paragraph of this despatch General Codrington tells us:- " The light of the sun played beautifully on the mass of smoke, of which the lower part lay long and heavily on its victim. The breeze passing it away over the remains of the town showed that a low line of ruin was all that remained of the pride of Fort Nlcholas, and one standing menace of the harbour lay buried under its waters." Surely, if General Codrington surpasses General Simpson, as much in the command of troops as he does of tropes, and wields his sword with as much facility and grace as he does his pen, the country has every reason to be glad of the change, and to rejoice that destiny sent the gallant Guardsman abroad to become the director of our army in the Crimea, rather than keep him at home, where his love for the picturesque might have mado him eventually diroctor of our gallery of national pictures. The General, to gratify his taste, has no alternative now left but to send us pictures from the Crinea; and that poetry might not mourn the absence of her sister, they are coupled together, and so the " Pride of Fort Nich:olas" is laid under the waves, and "another tanible proof of power" is given to the admiring eyes of the allied armies. 1 remain.

LAW REPOR'. I1QLLs' COURT. CHIa.YL~~2G- zTHE PAJAH OF COOnta vA A 7v T- -UA- I (Bcfor Me MaSTKI of th ROL!a.) § the MAsTrzs of the RoLx, in agrin referring to this "ase,said that ho considered, upon reflection, the plaintiff | was entitled to the production of the documents he sked Ifor. It wascleir4hat previosly to the year 1832 the I plaintiff w a creditor of the defendants, and had advanoad money on the securit.y of two of their promissory notes. This the defendants did not deny, but argued that, as the plaintiff was formerly Iajab of Coorg, and that State was an independent province which had been conquered by themu, t ese promisnory notes were, in fact, part of the booty of war, and, as such, had pased wholly out of the possssion of the plaitiff, and legaly belongedtothe defendants. It was not denied that several of the docutnent. which the $aintiffasked for related to the oujct-matteer of the amt, but it was urged that they ought not to be produced, inasmuch as they were of a political nature, and grivileged communications which hiL Pa-ised between the aefendants and their agents, relating to the government of the affairs of India. There was no doubt bUt that such documents, as between a third party, might be pleaded as privileged, but where they affocted a question immediately at issue between a Government and a private individual, assuming that the Government was properly brought boforo the Court, and its acts could bo legitimatelyinmpeahea, the Governmentstood in much the same situWton as any other defendant, and was bound to produce all documents written by itself to its own agents, which had a bearing upon the subject-matter of the suit. If a govemor was brought before this Court, and it was sought to rnake him produco communications wrhich had pased between his own Government and himself, in hi character of governor, the Court would not compel him to produee bhem, on the ground that they related to the affair. of another country, and were therefore privileged. Here the communications of which the production was sought had a direct bearing on the suit in which the Government itself were defendants, and the party aakin- for them was the plaintiff; who alleged the necessity of their production to prove a direct ~complaint againsttho Government. The particular documents asked for were not, in fact, communications between the defendants and the Board of Control, but between the East India Company and their agent3 respecting acts for which the plaintiff had brought the Company before this Court -to account. Some of the documents were evidently not of a political character, but wer communications between the plaintiffand bis own agents; and, as theplaintiff'could not establbeh his claim, if he had any, against tho Company without the production o£ them andother documents tendingto elucidate the facts of the case, his remedy ought notto b defeated by their being withheld. The effect of hus decision would be that the whole of the documents asked for must be produced at the India-honse for the plainitB's insp)ection, and he wvould make an order accordingly. iRAY V. JOWNSTO. isu HoNosm gave judgment in this case, the facts of which have been previous1y given, and may be briefly recapitulated as follows:-The plaintiff, who was formerly a ward of the Court of Chancery, became entitled, on the death of Ids Ifather, in 1838, to a life estate in a property called Tring Park, and to dividends of certain stock, which, with acuumulations, nowX amount to upwards of '19,0001. In 18752, being two years before the plaintiff attained his majority, he became acquainted vith the defendant Johnston, at that time living in Hil-street, May. fair, and in the course of time the two became sworn friends, drawing and accepting biUs for their mutun1 ac. commodation. They both went abroad together, and took apartments in the llue Castiglione for a term of six years, and subsequently became jointly interested in tle house in Hll-street, and purchased an estate at Feltham, in Mriddlesex, for their joint ocrnpation. Plaintiff's share of this last purchase, according to the defendant's representations, amounted to 14,500k, including theprice of some new furnituro for the London house. In 1834 plaintiff attained his majority, and was informed by Johnston that his share of liability on tho bils they had been mutually drawing and accepting amonnted to 60,00., and that it would be a good plan to buy or tako them all up. For this purpose plaintiff was introduced to a Mir. Adams, of Ware, who agreed to see to the matter. A few days after plaintiff came of age he execnted a bond in favour of Adams, to secure the payment of 40,000!. with interest at 74 per cent., aud further executed a mortgage ou his lproperty to the West of England Fire-office for 30,0 00, partly to repay Mr. A1dams 10,OOO that person had advanced, and partly, according to the plaintiff's statement, to oblige Mr. Johnston. In the mouth of August, 1854, Johnston married, and, without conslting plaintiff settled the house in Hlill-street, the property at Feltham, and al the furniture, supposed to have been jointly belonging to both plaintiff and John-ton, on MTrs. Johnston, and when plaintiff called a few days aiter in Hlill-stroet he was denied admittance. Indignant at such treatment, the plaintiff filed the present hill for an account of all the transactions between him and Johnston, and for a declaration to the effect that he (the plaintiff) was entitled to his moiety in these several houses, property, and effects, either in Pariz, London, Feltham, or elsewhere. The defence set up by Johnston was that he had made hiimself liableto large sums of money on bills for the plaintiff, and in right of his liability was entitled to lien. on the property in dispute. The Court, without calling on the p laintsffs counsel to reply, directed the acconnt as pra yed, but reserved the question of lien.

A case having been caDed on in which there had beea no delivery of papers to his Honour's clerk, The VICE-CHA-NCELLOR observed that this omission was now become so common that it was absolutltlyneces33ry to lay down some stringent rule upon the subject. Sir John Lach in such a case would, no donbt, have ordered the c Luse to be struck out, and the parties would have had to b3ar the delay and expense of a re-setting dov In order to cure this evil the best way would be to take care that the names of parties who had so omitted to leave papers, and were not present, should be made known, in order that the tacing-master should disallow such costs. Jr. GLASSE said that he thouight .such a proceeding unnecessary, inasmuch as there was an order which provided for a case of neglect. The VIcE-CeeAscsELLor. said that it was very espeaient that such order thould be enforced, as the delay and expense to suitors and the general inconvenience to all parties were matters of considerable import. (Beforc rice-chancdlor Sir W. 1'. WOOD.) RODD)AN V. 31ORIEY. This was a suit instituted for an account of what was due to the plaintiff for principal and interest on a bond dated the 29th of May, 1r26, Lunder the hand and seal of one Josias Beadshaw Morley, deceased, and also, if necessary, of his other unpaid debts; for an account of his personal estate, and tho application thereof in payment of hisg debts ina due course of administration ; and, m case of a deficiency of personal estate, for an account of his real estates, and for sale or mortgage thereof to maLe good such deficiency; and forpaymentof such debts out of the amount so raised. The bond in question ws originally given to ono Joseph Brown for 3001., and by him assigned to Mr. William Adamthwaite, who had diedl having by his will appointedthepresent plaintifM- his executors, andthey climed the amount due onEthe bond as part of his estate. JoiasU ReadshawIMorley, the obligor of the bond, died in 1&27, hv specificay devised certain real ostate to his son Morley (since deceased) for life, with remainder to his fast and other sons in tail, with divers remainders over; and, having devised all other his real estates to trusteea to sell for payment of encumbrances, with directions to settle the unsold parts of such estates upon the same trusts as wvere declare by his will of the specifically devised estate. iThe testator left a son, Thomas, his heir-at-la. Franciz | Mlorley the tenant forife under the will, paid interest u!pon the bond for 300. up to a few years before his death, which happened in 1854, and his infant son was now tenant intal of the estates. The whole question turned upon whether payment of interest by Francis M1orley within 20 years before biU filed was or was not sufficient to take the case out of the Statutes of Limitation as against the estate of Josias Eeadshawv Morley. Mr. Bagahawe andMEr. Bagmimawe, jun., werefor the plaintiffs; Mtr. Willcoclk, MIr. W. M. James, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Cairns, Mr. Chapman Barber,. and Mfr. Hinde Palmer for the several defendants. The VIcE-CRA3cErmor said that, having had an opportunity of consideringthe case (whichhbd been partlagued some days since), he had made up his m3ind upon the point. There was a difference between bond and sur.ple contract debts. tTh person could mn-e a promnise which would bind any one but himself or those for whom he was agent. Tho rig,ht to sue upon a d more than 20 years old depended upon the excception in the fth section of the 3d andl 4th William 1V., cap. 42, and no Squestion of promise arose. lnder the old law there was no statute of limitations as to bonds, but the defendant pleaded either aotrit ad dim or serst post dikm, and if 20 years had elapsed the presumption of law was that the bond had been satisfied. But, if upon such pleas there was evidence of payment of interest within 20 years, that-was evidence to rebut the presumption which would otherwise arise. The statute of 3d and 4th William IV., cap. 42, prohibits an action upon a bend 2after 20 years, withthe exception thatif any cnowledgment had been mzade either by writing, or by part payment or part satisfaction, an action might be brought within 20years after such aclknowledgment, part payment, or part satisfaction. But it wavs clear from the concluding portion of the section that the remedy was only intended to be yehervedagainstthepartymalingtheaclmowledgement, andnot that the bonlshouldbe set up altogether. The only question in the present casc s, hether it cam3ew in the 3dand4th Williasm IV., c. 27, a. 49. There wvas no aulthorityr for say. ing thalt a bond came within that section, aud in the absenoe of any authority that it did he felthound to hold that it did not. That section relited to sums ofimoney seurd by " any nortgage,- judgmnent, or lien, or otherwise charged upon or payabe out of any Landor rent." A bond as3 no charge upon real estate wahatever; it only gasve a )gI%t of proceeding against the heir.

COURT OF QUEN-S BENCH. Guar)nALT. F. 20. cvn%Tr.r nr ernn.r (S9vinis at Nid Prium, before Lord CxmIsBELm and Spccial J.wrics.) A person, who, we believe, had been in custody all night, was this morningbrougbt up before the Lord Chief Justice, at the ating of the Cou rt, upoa the clarge of personating a specialjuryman, named David Wilson, of Cannon-street, Conan ercial-road. A lNdy, who, weunder-tood, wias the wife of the special juryman who had been rersonated, was examined by Lord Campbell, and. in answer to inquiries, stated that her husband, the real David Wilson, was at the present time absent from England, at Calcutta. Lord C,%!rPBELL then told the pretended special juror that now was the time for him to say what he had to sgay in his defence. The prisoner said uothing. Lord CAM5PBELL then commented in terms of juct severity on the conduct of the prisoner in thus endeavouriDg to pervert the fountains of justice bypersonating a juryman who had been summoned to assist its administration. His Lordship said it was impossible for hin to say what the motives of the prisoner might have been-whether his object was to pervert justice, or merely to gratify a sordid appetite for the sum of one guinea, which would have been alleoaed hiim if he had served. Whliatever the motive miglht have been, the act was of iiiSt prnicious example, and if it could be done on the trial of a civil cause, it might be done slso on a criminal trial, even in a case of murer, where the life of a fellow-creature was at stake. He(LordCampbell) felt itto be his duty to make a severe example of the prisoner, in order that others might be deterred from such attempts, and tberefore the sentence was, that for the contempt of whiclL he had been guilty, he be imprisoned in the gaol at MIewgate for three calendar Months. sCMVE1BaG V. MOSM Mfr. Knowles, QC., and Mr. Mlanisty appeared for the plaintiff, and *r. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Honyman for the defendant. This was a trial by the Lord Chief Justice without the assistance of a jury, and depended upon a point of law ariSing on the construction of a charteryarty. Lord C,UIPBELL having heard the evidence on both sides, and the arguments of counsel thereon, said he would take time to consider his decision, and would give it at the sitting of the Court to-morrow (this day). STATE OF TIEE COURT In the course of this day great difficulty ras experienced by the parties attending on biisiness in making their way into and out of court. This arose from the crowded state of the avenues, which are usually filled by a mnultitude of persons who have no bunsiness there, and who so stop the way that it is with difficulty counsel, attorneys, or witnesses can struggle into or out of the court. When witnesses were caluld it was generlly some minntes before they could make their appearance in the witness-box. Lord CAMPBELL was at length obliged to express his dissatisfaction at this state of things. 3Mr. H. HILL suggested that the inconvenience would be remedied if the use of the side entrance were restricted to those who had business in court. Lord CArMPBELL said, he had given orders to that effect once before, and the order had been obeyed for a day or two. His Lordship knew the authorities of the city of London weredesirons of wsisting the Gourt; there lought to be a stronger staff of officers m attendance. IITHOIEF ,LND OTUERS, ASSIGSEES, V. r11PPS, PUBLIC orrIcas Mfr. Edwin James, Q.C, Mlr. H. Hill, Q.C-, and 31r. J. Brawn appeared for the plaintiffs; and the AttorneyGeneral, Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Serjeant Hayes, and Mr. Field for the defendant. TheGplaintitfs in this action were the assignees of a bankrupt, George Pell, a solcitor, scrivener and trader, at Welford, in Northamptonshire, who sued the defendant, the public officer of the Northamptonshire Banking Company, to recover the valne of certain f.arming stock belonging to the bankrupt, which the defendant had taken possession of under an alleged sale. The sale in question took place on the 30th of August, 1854, after notice of an act of bankrupty, which it was alleged took place two days pre%iously-viz., on the 2Sth of the same month. The trial lasted nearly the whole day, until a late hour. The foUowing is a brief ontline of the facts as proved by the evidence given on both sides, the single issue being, whether the waukrupt had in reality conmitted an act of bankrupicy on the 2Sth of Augnst by leaving his home with intent to defeat or delay his creditors. The bankrupt, GeoTgc Pell, being a solicitor, had embarked in varions speculations, including, among others, farming and the rormation of railway companies. In these speculations he had been largely assisted by Mr. Spiller. the managin director of the Notthamptonshire Banking Company, until at length he became indebted to that finn to the enormous amount of about 40,0001. In his capacity of solicitor he had been enaged in the formation or a great many ravlway companies, and thus he had ran up very large bills of costs; but when the railway panic took lace he became as active as an amalgamater as he had formerly been a promoter ;andL finally, when the act for winding up those unsuccessful schemes pissed, he becsmn equally active and skdlful in vinding them up. By these means he had ran up bills of costs to a large smount, and upon the security of these bills obtained advances to the extent of upwards of 20 000X from the Northiamptonsliire Banking Company. The xnkcrupt also engaged in farming, and had several farms in the county of Northampton, and in order to stock these farms he obtained from the banking compana advances to the extent of several thousand pounods. these advances were secured upon the stock by two bils of sale, dztedresp ctively in December. 185, and March, 1S53. In the month of August, 1854, the affairs of the bankrnupt became hopeless, the binking company would no longer honour his checks, and other creditors began to press their claims. In the month of January of that year an order had been maSe by the Court of Chancery directing the bankrnpt to payto certain creditorsthesum of 4541.5s. 5d.within aweek after serviceof the order. The order was not served til the 18th of larch,when fr. Sh3en, thesolicitor, sgreedtotakethe amount by instalments of 50W. per month. These instalmnents were not paid, andMr. Shaen several times threatened to issue an attachment for the contenpt in not obevimr the order of the Court. Under these circumstances, the bLnkrapt drew a check upon the Northai nshiA Banking Company for50.. and sent it to MrL. Sh=en The check was presented, but, not being honoured, ws returned. Upon this, Mr. Shaen wrote the bankrupt a letter, dated the 25th of August, 1874, in which, after referring to the aishonour of the check, he said he should "proceed at once to enforce payment of the whole balance dne." The bankrupt, on the 27th of August, which was a Stnday, wrote to 3fr. Spiller, the manager of the bankinforming him that he had received from Mr. Shaen " notice of attachment," that matters were now come to a "crisis," and that thiswould necessitate his leaving home that nzght, or early next morning. Accordingly the next morning (Monday, the 2Sth of August) the ba Dt left Welford for Rughb, and, having remained the whole day at the Eagle Hotel. he next day, the 29th, proceeded to london, to his place of business at Club-chambers Regent-reet Whle in London he went to Mr. Shaen's lffice,an toTheofficerof Jessrs. Chilton and Burton, in Cheancery-lne, solicitors to the banling company, and thus sh:owed, as the defendant contended, that his object in leaving home was not to avoid arrest, but in the execution of a thret whiich he had frequently before made to Mr. Spiller, that if he wvould not continue his advances he would leave Welford, and so bring on a crisis which wvould be equally injurious to Mr. Spiller as to himoself. On the 30th of August a meeting vas held, at wliich the bankrupt signed an acknowledgment that for the sum of 10,0001. he had sold all the stock upon severalofhis fanns to a 3Mr. Revi, and under this formal sale the banking company, by means of 31r. Revi", had become possessed of property valued at about 8,0001. The plaintiffs contended that the defendant was not entitled to this property, imasmuch as the pretended sle took place on the 0tth of Auagust, two days alter they had been affected with notice of an act of bankruptcy committed by the bankrupt in leaving his home th at( pr Pol had tneot Sbeen° adjudiged a bankrupt tvill the 2a of August, 1855, and Then en the petition of his ow clerk. From this it was argued that tle bankruptcy was a friendly one, and that theobject Wastodefraud the company by depriving them of the security- which they had got upon prope purchased by their own mineofy, advanced in hard cash. The bankrupt ws denounced as a "monstrous swindler," whom the plaintiffs did not dare to put into the box. It appeared that the action was brought by order of the Commissioner of Bankrnptcy, on behalf of the general body of creditors, who had proved their debts to the extent of 9,000!. Iord CAxsBarLn, in summing up the evidence, said, the defendant admitted the validity of the ba,inkriptcy. The acton was brouht on bebalf of creditors to the amount of 9,0001, and, m obedience to an order of the commissioner, to see whether the property in question really belonged to he aignees. In -that c it wod be equally dividedi among all the creditors, ndthe defendanit, if the plaintiffs -should obtain a verdict, might come in with the rest. His Lordsbip expressed his regret that- the formality oE a sham sale of the bank- opt'shpropety for 1h r . had beentgone through on the a th of August for it eamedthat under the two bills of fle which bad been pui t in eidence, the banking comn had authority to take the wfhole of the property had they. done so before notice of an act of bankcruptc. The guestion thenA for the urwa, ,whether on the 2Bth of August the bankr} com,mitted an act of hankuptcy. If AEekaaddone so it was dear th. defendant biadnotice of it. HisLordship then went minutely over the evidence which relaed to that part of the case, and asked the jury whether any reaonable man who received Mr. Shaen'sleter of the h of AWst would not bi e sppoed. that he was oTQid thl exeliir Qof the Wt of attichmtAt5 that wa6 what the Iaw considered an act of bsnkruntcy. The jury retired to consider their &ct, ana on their return into court found for the plaintiffs. It bad been previou-ly arraged that if the jury ahould findeverdict forthe piaintiflf, the amount of damagesshould be settlhd out of court. SECOND COURT.

On the 29th of July in that year a nieeting of the directors of the company was held at 0, Pall-mall, the defendant being present, when the plaintiff was appointed secretary And purser at a salary of 504 per annum. He entered at once upon his daties, which he glfilled up to the 1st of February 1855. at which period a aum of 621. . had become due to aim for sary and a further mum of 151. 14s. Fd. for money which the plaintiff had disbursed for the use of the company. The coinpany was then broken up and the mines abandoned. The plaintff had now brought his action against one of the largest shareholders in the company. Theplaintiff wascalled, and the minutes of the company were put in to prove this statement. The defence ws that the prospects of the company be| coming vy nmuch onr , the hahreholders wished to &l andon thespeculation, and one of the directors, named Mansei, agreed to take npon iimeelf their liabilities in consideration of having everything in connexion with it placed !inbis bands. Subsequently to ths he had ppointed the plintiffas.hisown servant, although the other directors used to attend meetings, which were till held, relative to borrowing money for the purpose of carrying on the company. This intention, however, was notcarriedout, and Pn yebruary, 1855. all such thoughts were finally abandoned. Mfr. MA[nsel then became bankrupt, and the plaintiff then sued the defendant, upon whom, it was contended, he had no claim. Mr. Justice Crosspror-, in summing up, said that the plaintiff would not be bound by the arrangement between fr. Mansel and the company, nnless he had been informed of it. They must say, whether in their opinion the plaintiff bad been the servant of the company oronly o£ ManseL. If he had been the servant of the company, then the defendant ws clearly liable; if not, their verdict mont be for the defendant. The jury returned averdict for the plaintiff for 78t. 4s. 5d., the amount claimed. G.o-rrUN V. IwEzSS. This was an action brought to recover compensation in damages for an alleged brec of contract. Tihe defendant paid S?. into court as the amounot of damge sustained by the plaintiff. Mtr.

In 5eptember last the plaintiff told the defendant, with whom be had had dealings for flour, that he wanted another shop, and the Latter informed him that he had one to let at Islington, which he could have for it. or T0. The plaintiff went to see it, and looked over the premises, undertanding from the defendant that he s to have a 19yeg lease, at a rent of 55C Hc ah s very much pleased with the appearance of the shop, and. being desirous of obtaining immediate possession, offered to gioe 80e for it. The defendant, however, had by that time raised his price to 12Wz., which sum the plaintiff ultimately agreed to py, handing over a sunm of 40L as deost and the defendant signed a memnorandum, by whlich he contracted to give him the lease and possession of the premises. Hloevevr, the defendant had failed in doing so, and, in fact, he had no title at all to sell the lease. The alleged value of the premises was 3001. The defence was that the plaintiff had been told oriinally that thero was some difficulty with respect to the title, and that he must take itwith all risks. Assoon asitwa discovered that these difficulties could not be overcome, the defendant had offered to return the 404 which had been paid as deposit. Before the defendants case was concluded the Court adjourned until to-morrow morning.

Ifonyan appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Knowles and M Ir M'Lachian for the de- The plaintiff is a barrister on tne midlind Cireuit, and in December, 1852, was attracted by a prospectus describing tle Aigle d'Or Mining Company of Virginia, which -was stated to be enroUled in PariS, the ecpital being 75,0001.. in shares of 11. eacb. The company was declared to be " cn comaunaudiI," and to be under a comnitcde mirrcilhsnce in Paris, with the j7rant "' Robert et Cie., 9.9 Rue Richelimn." The coumcil in Londonconsistedof Lord StephenChichester, the Hon. D. A. Bingham, Mr. Pierce Somerset Rutler, Dr. Such, and the defenidant, described as of Walthamstow. The operations of the company were to be directed to the working of a valuable freehold gold mine in GoochLand County, State of irginia, and, as an adjlunctive interest, to the allocation of a tract of land, in e%tent 75,W00 acres, situate in Logan and Tazevell countics, in the nameState. This vast tract vas to be apportioned to the shareholders, and to be superadded to their interest in the gold mine. The gold inining property was represented to consist of 430 acres of land, within 15 miles of the Great Central Railway of Virginia, and to possess gold bearing quartz of great richne-s. The titles of the whole of the property vere declaTed to be perfect, free from all encumbrances. The plaintiff; hoping rather to become a landowner in irgina than to paticipate in the profits of the mine of gold, applied for 100 shares, and ini return received a letter of allotment for that number, on which he paid 100t. into the bank of Messrs. Dimsle to the credit of the defendant and three other directors, and he received in return 100 scrip certificates, signed by the defendant and other persons. About this time the directors and other interested persons sent out to America Mr. Willins, a special pleader to inquire as to the validity of the title to the land, and that gentleman reported that, instead of 75,000'acres there were only 15,C00, on which it was agreed not to complete the purchase and to abandon the land scheme, which was accordingly done at a meeting held at Paris in August, 153. The plaintiff knewnothing whatever of these proceedin and took ne stepsuntil May, 1854, when he wrote to the dofeudant to inquire the state of matters, and particularly as to-the land scheme. The defendant answered that the ore crushing was going on, and on being reminded by a second letter that he ad not answered about the land scheme, replied that it was abandoned, the secretary was dispensed with, nnd'the papers in Pariswith the e.f7ant. Theplaintiff then sought for the offices of the company, and found that they had fitted from one place to another till they had finaly disappeared from London. Mr. A. S. Hill, of the Oxford ctrwt, also went to Paris to seek the g6rant, and after almoit fruitless incluiries discovered one Robert Coleman, a clerk in an Amencan bank there, who said that he had been " Robert et Cie," the q762ant to the scheme. His LosDCsmp directed the jury that the plaintiff had a right to recover the amount which he had paid for his shares if they were of opinion either that the consideration for which the money was given had entirely failed, or on the ground of fraud in the defendant. On this latter polint it was not only necessary to prove that the representations made by the prospectus, and which were virtually made by the defendant, were untrue, but also thiat he knew that they were untrue. The jury found that the consideration had failed, and on that ground, without decidingthe other point, gave a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 101l.
COURT OF EXCHEOIJFEM FEt 2( PARROTT V. PI3IMZGTOW. (SiUi,igs at N,i Pris, before the CHIEF BARoN and SpeciatJuries, at Guildha,%j Xr. Keating and Mr. 1e Breton were counsel for the plaintiMf; Mr. Wilde and Mr. Milwardappeared for the defencdants. Thisvwas an action in whichtheplaintiffsought to recover damges from the defendants, as the cwners of the ship Shalimar, for the breach of their contract entered into by them with the laintiff on ta;ing passages for himself, his wife, and child as second cabm passengers from Melbounme to iUverpool last spring. The breaches alleged by the plaintiff were the omission to provide for the pTngers during the voyage safficient and wholesome and a competent cook, as set forth in the dietary advertised in the colony, and sufficient and cleanly accommodation in respect of waterclosets. The defendants paid 121. lOs. into court as to the first breach, and as to the second and third they traversed the contract and breach. The Shalimnir is a clipper ship, belonging to the 'White Star line, trading between Liverpool and Melbourne, and sailed fromEnglandwith cargoandeemigrants to Melbourne in November, 1854, on her first vorg aving arrnved in safety, and after a speedy voyage, wrh, as the last, was, no doubt, the fastest on record, the defendan|ts agents advertised her return voyage in - March last, when the plaintiff, who vas a flour merchant in Melbourne, engaged passages for himself, his wife, and child in the cond cabin, for which he paid the sam of 821. 10s There were 17 first-cass, 40 second-class, and 90 third-class passengers. The dietary for the first was unlimited, the pmsge being 651.;- that for the second and third classes was ample on paper, though liuits, varying in-the proportion of the fares, were placed upon them, and a cook was promised to each clas. After the Shalimar had been at sea a fortnight- complaints.were made by the second and third class gassengers of the ouality of theflourasbeingboth sour an musty. The biscuits were dedared to be mouldy and bad, and the cookery execrable, the peasoup being described as thin, dirty, greasywater with hard buUetsin it, which was sometimes burnt, sometimes underdone, and sometimes overdone. Some of these complaints were brought under the notice of the captain and surgeon, who admitted them to be well-founded in part, and did their best to remedy themn but the cook was no cook, but a-carpenter orfishermin by tade, -who was working his passAge home, so that no great Improvement couka be expected in that department, and the sengers were fain to content themselves with the national right of grumbling. In this they indulged till they actually began to laugh ia bitterness at,the soup, and puddings, andbred, while some of them tcok to chronicling their Frievances in the shape of a diary or log. In these compositions, one of which was produced-in court, there were entries not only'of bad, but of defxcient food, and it appeared that before the end of the vo hre, which was a short one, andoccupied just27 days, the mppy fe'l olE m resEpect of tea, ooffee,pox)tatoes,andt fil cenaddiitioto this there wrere constant complaints of the filthy conditioa oF the aterchoase, the detils- of 'which wre may well ip excused- from entering into.

All tho malcoitents, xcept the plaintiff appear to have assented to this, and te captain awarded . to each second-class, and 41. to echthidulap.aeger. The plaiintiff, deeming that this. award =a twIoily unsatisfactor~y, hrougnit his claims before v. jury, and in support of it to-dy presented himself and severa of his fellow-passengers, who agred 'in stating in round terns that their treatmnent was "most shamnefu. The plaintiff stated that he had fortunately lad in a good stockE of provisions, on which he fell hack, and thakt but for such foresight the condition of his wife and chil would have been wors than it was.1 Mdr. WVrLisr, on the part of the defendants, contended that the complaints of the plaintiff and all the other passengers wer e; e crtdthat, like all landsmen at sea, time hung lieaviy on their haLnds ; and that they betooke themnselvcs to the "1truly British privilege" of grumrbling to pas theldUl hiours. As to the facts, he urged akndproved by the evid ence of the captain, steward, mate, and several of the passengers that, is oider to obviate the complaLints which had before been. made of the colonial agents, the Shalimar had been e provisione with best flour at Liver- pool, sufficient for the return voyage ; that some other flourwaa laid in aLt Melbourneand that all of it was goodl till very hot weather set in, wv.ich maade it sour. This which the witnesss for the defendants said was the only fault which couild be attributed to the tlour, was the inievitatble result of the weather-a cause wholly beyond the rontrol of the defendants. As t-o the sua i t was proved that an abundanice vwas laid in ; but it frell iort becaume somLe one bad pilfered the store and for this the defendants ought not to be made responsible. fAs to the biscuits, they were dcclared to be excellent and aLbundant, and it was admitted by the plaintiff that the substanstials, guch as salt beef and pork, were free from objection. With res, et to the cook, it was admnitted by the dlefendants t1.at ho was not such a mnan as might be qualified for 3livarts, but lae was the best that -could be got, the regula second cabin cook Imaing-belted to -the diggings nde all the cirtumstances of the case it was contended for the defendants that they had done all that could reaksonably be expected of thiem. They couldi not be called upoin to ra rantec perfection, and if they had substantiay comninej with the terms of their contract, they had done enough, and were not liable for the unexpected faiure or deficiency of food, any maore than for the defective cooker7 of a mian who, as Was alleged by them, had bezen treated with grog- by tho passengers themselves, and so incapacitated fr-om the perfornance of his dutles,- The defendants, however, bwl aid into court 121. 1Os. as damages, which were esti'MAted en theo scale adopted by Captain Schomberg, a markt comipetent judgpe on such miatters, and beyond that they hoped the jury woiuld not go in. estimating the comn usation for the exsgerated grievances of the plaintiff and his friends.

EXCHEQUER CHAMBER. WEDNIVSIAV lHILTOS Vr r Th'T.mv Ittttng in Error.-Prcent-Mfr. Baron ALDEnsoq and I fMr. Justice WILLIAM1S MIr. Baron ALDEaso.N delivered the judement of the Coourt in this case. The action was brought upon a bond entered into by 17 persons, being owners of mills and other works, carrying on business as manufacturers of cloths, &c. Thc bond recited that there were combinutions among the workpeople, and that the masters were prevented from carrying on their business, and that it was necessary for tho moasters to take rome steps in order to have a control over their property, and forthatpurposethe obligors had entered into the bond to place thenselves and the mode of carrying on thclr business under the direction of the majority of the obligors for the period of 12 months; and that any one of the obligors who broke the condition of the bond shoild forfeit 500 To this it was pleaded that there was no consideration for the bond, and that it was given in restraint of trade. To this ple there was a demurrer. The Court of Queen's Bench had given judgment in favour of the plea. The Court of Error were of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was correct, and onght to be afflirmed. The question was whether this was a bond in restraint of trade. The obligors were prevented from paying any amount of wages except such as the majority might fis. T'ey could only employ-persons at such times as the snaioritymightdetermine;-tnc heuss of rwork and -the discipline of their establishme~nt wrere to be fixed by the majority. All these were obEigations restraining the ioner of theoligorsfromcarryingon theirown trade according to their own discretion, and therefore it was evidently a bond in restraint of trade. The Court did not vean to say that the bond was illegal in the sense of being criminal and punishable, and the Court did not e_ress an opinion upon that point. But at was said that the obligation wias legal by reason of the circumstances against which it Was intended to operate, as thers wd s a counter combiation existing among the workmDen, and that the object of the bond wams not only to protect t.he manufacturers but also the workmen. Still, this bond would be in restraint of trade, and if it should be held to be valid, so w.ould be the combination amonr the wrorkpeople, and such COm bination would not be T)unisbabIe. The judgment for the defendant would therefore be afrmed. Judgment affirmed. CreOrr V. LMLEY. Mr. Baron AtnEusoNs delivered the judgment of the Court in this case. The Court of Error were of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ought t) be affirmed. There were two queetions-whether there hat been a forfeiture of the lease of the Opera-house; an I Secondly, if there had been a forfeiture, whether there haI been a waiver of it by the acceptance of rent. The Court were of opinion that the three grounds set out as breaches of the covenant operated as a forfeiture; bat the Queen's Bench had considered that the warrants of attorney which had been given by the defendant amounted to a forfeiture, although afterwards waived. This Court did not, however, consider that the executing warrants of attorney under the circunistances were encumbering the property so as to warrant a forfeiture; they were given under compulsion, and were not voluntary, being given only to save expense and gain time. Therefore thejudgment for the defendant Lumley must be affirmed. Judgment below affirmed. The COURT were not yet preRared to give judgment in the cases of " Cooper and Sle, and in the Copper Miners Company.

We shall give the facts when it is delivered. THE DEKN-SAVRY-SAVAGE. This was a suitpromotedbythreeTr iity-housepilots aid others, to procure salvage remuneration for services rendered to the American ship Denmark, on the 25th of October last. The Denmark, laden vith deals, bound from N!ew Brunswick to Grimsby, during a heavy gale struck upon the Puller Bank. The salvoss, seeing her danger from thebeach, put offin alarge gey with the view of saving thelives of thecrew, butwhile proceeding towards her met theru inttwo boats. After directing them into a safe channel to reach the shore, they continued their course, and on reaching thevesselboardedher,andby great exertion conducted her in safety to Portsmouth. The value of the pro. perty salved was 3,390. Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss appeared for the salvors ; the Queen's Advocate and Dr. Deane for the owners. The learned JUDGE considered it a most meritorious service, rendered at jivat risk to the lives of the salvors. He awarded 1,000. THE EDE.S.-SALVAGE. This also was a salvage suit, and was brought by the yawl Albatross, manned with 22 hands, to obtain compensation for services rendered to the bark Eden, off Lowestoft, on the 7th of November last. The bark, of the burden of 516 tons, being in the service of Her Majesty's Governmenta as a transport, was proceeding from Bomarsund to Woolwich with guns and other stores.

. COvR Or BANKRPTCY, B AaZ-strc FW. , IN RN D. L. LZMJUDWGM:;, I (Before Mr. Commisioner FO1BLABo1u) lThe bankrpt, Pavid Lt obld eWisc of Salters.halcourt, bill dlscoante, amd merchant, applied for his certifi. cute a few days ago, when judgmeut was reserved. The Case has been fully reported itm 27we Times. Iiis HoNoune now delivered judgment. He said, ince this matter was before him he had read the examination, and had looked minutely into the balance-sheet- and he must confess that he had derived very little inormation from the one or the other. It still remained a mystery to him how that business could have been carried on - how a man commencing with a doubtful capital o? something like 500 could have been enaed in trnsactions to so largo an amount as was dsclosed in the balance-sheet. The Westminster Improvement Bonds remained as much a mystery to hima s, ever, He could not understand how, if they were such securities as the nmeo implied1 they could posgibly have iivolved the amount of loss which followed e transactions in this instance. He found the losses not only thousands of pounds, but hundreds of thousands of pounds; he could not, therefore, express any surprise if the trading, if it were so called -.but leoitimate trading he (the commissioner) could not call itshould have ended in bankrptcy. He considered that the bnkrulpt had been excedingly culpable in the eXtent of his spOcuJatious. If a man had net anything to fall back upon for the security of his creditors he had no right to enter into seculations of such magnitude. It fortunately hitpnned in this case that there were few whlom he could ca innocent injured creditors, for the mass of the trnsactions was with persons either engaged in similar reckless transactions, or with persons who managed to take sufficient security to themselves in the way of enormous discotnts to indemnify them from accidental losses. He could trace nothing like hardship upon individual creditors, for, with the exception of the bank-ers, ,twase s no creditor of theetrdinary character. The hses rwere enormous, bad debts enormous, trade expenser enormous, -,interest and diecount uXrwards of 20,0V01., Fnd the law costs, as rhight easily be imagined, wrere not inconsiderable- neithewere the domes. tic and personal expenses so moderate as they ought to have been in tho case of a man who strted in the world, alter experiencing recent failure, Ith so small a capital as 474l ffn tho other hand, although the kind of business which thisbanktrptcarried onwasonewhich wasconstantly accompanied with trickery, dishonesty, snd fraud, he (the commissioner) did not find that any of those offences had been committed by the bankrupt. He seemed to have carried on the business vith as much honesty as it would admit. Thewr was no person to complain of any misrepresentation as to the value of those curious securities which he put forth to the world-curious by one very remarkable elucidation. When he first heard of the yacht bothought it wvas for the bankrut'own personal extravanccs. Buthe found that this yacht was onec of the most curious that ever sailed from Southampton. This yacht represented on one occasion 2,000?., and in a few days 1,000D v. as taken back, and he found it even at one time taken at 6,0001., and by somo difEculty in the registration this FIlyms Dutchman had come into the possession of the official assignee, and it was now rated st about 2001. When he found such mystic transactions as this-property really worth only 2001. passed for 0,000& and 2,(000.-he (the commissioner) did not take much blame to himself for not being able to unravel the mystery. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court would not refuse the certificate altogether, but it would issue as of the lowest class. It vas no duty of that Court to encourage such reckless trading. The l¶itimate trader would always be protected, and those who failed in legitimato trading were entitled to that merey which the Legislature had provided. But trading of this character -persona without capital going, as it were, to the gaming table without a penny in their pockets, with the certainty that they have nothing for their creditors if they failed-it was, to use a vlgar but not an inappropriate expression,"headsIwin,tailsyoulose." Therc had been no fraud, end the bookkeeping had been tolerably good, which ho again repoeated was a test of honest intention.

This was an action on a covenant in an apprentice deed, whereby the defendant had covenanted that his son should serve the plaintiff for seven years as a catpenter at certain lowwages, stipulated, during theperiodof his apprenticeship. The defendant's son came of age some two years before the expiration of the period of apprenticeship, and then refused to work for the plaintiff except at journeyman's wages, tnd the plaintiff was, in consequence, compelled to hire a 0lourneyman to fill his place, paying 22s. a-week wages for the w.ork which the defendant's son could have done equaiy well at 7s. a-week. The defendant paid20t into conit, but the plaintiff not being satisfied with this amount, sought further damages. The case resolved itself simply into one of the amount of damages to be given, and after muuch evidence had beens gone throulgh on both sides, the jurr' found a verdict for the plaintifJ; with 20o. damages in addition to thue suma paid into court. r.

It appeared that the pldntiff is a quiet andrespectable old faxmer, and a tenant of a lady named Dalton, who owns a considerable estate at Glasson, near Lamcaster. In May last she had a dinner of her tenants, to which the plantiff, among a number of other farmers, her tenants, was invited. On the 19th of May the Lancastav GazeUe published a para. graph headed "Patriotism at Glassen," and signed "A Correspondent," stating that at this dinner the plaintiff proposed, and another farmer seconded, as a toast, "The health of the Emperor of Russia, and may the war last 10 years," which toast was said to have been enthusiastically received by the farmeis present. The patraph went on to state that the contemptibility of the proposer and seconder of the toast bad alone saved them from being ducked in the canal by the indigaant inhabitants. It Was proved that no such toast was ever proposed by the plaintiff or by anybody else at the dinner. The plaintiff soon afterwards was jeered at in the market, and on reading the paragraph himself in the paper, which he said with great indignation he had taken in for 20 years, he absolutely shed tears at the imputation cast upon his loyalty. Miss Dalton and her steward were equally igdinant, and thus backed up, the plaintiff went to the defend ant's office and demanded to know the author. He was handed the manuscript, which was contained in a letter, which was anonymous. He then demanded the publcation of an apology in the newspaper, 51. reward to be offered to discover the author, printed bills to be posted, containing a lithographed copy of the letter, with the apology and reward offered to discover the author and a copy to be sent to every newspaper editor in the kiugdom at tne defendant's expense. These terms not being complied with, although an apology was printed, the -present action wasbrought. For the defence it was urged that the defendant had been hoaxed and deceived by the paragraph sent to him, and published by-him, and that he had done everything in his power to provide an antidote for the poison he had unwittingly disseminated; and that the paragraph published might mean a desire to protract the war in order that a lasting and honourable peace might be established, which Russia would be in future mI no haste to disturb; and that it did not necessarily impute a desire to keepup the price of corn. - His LORDSsP having defined what was a libel and what a pvflqged conmmunication whieh a newspaper miht print, the Jury that this was not a ond wic criticism of a public event coming under the latter definition, and which the defendant oight publish, because no such toast had ever been given. 1t was a question for the ;ury whether it was alibel-namely, a publication calculated to injure the plaintiff tand to bring him into public hatred, ridicule, or contempt. If the mary thought it was a libel, under the circumstances. g y gta The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-damager, is.

Johnson and Walker for 7SI. odd on the 28th of November last, evidenoe having alrcady been given that he had disposed of four btars to tbht firm. Tho learned counsel then proceeded to caJl the following witnesses - 3fr. G. F. Bult.-I carry on the businems of a gold reLiner and bullion dealer in Clheapside. On the 15th of May last I remitted to Paris a quantity of Californian gold, eonsisting of 24 bars, and weighing 2,1)00ounces. Most of it was below, and some few bars 'were better than, the standard. J. Dawson, porter to the l.st witness, said he paekod the ola in a trong wooden box, -which he deUietedtol r Chapli, the carrier, w;o cal}d for it and took it away in Mr. 1. T. Abell bullionidealer, of 1, Excliange-Ildings, said,-On the 1bth of May last I remitted a quaitity of gold to Paris, conEisting of six bars, and weighing 2,1251 ounces. It was Australian gold, and was packodinastrong w ooden case, and mNrked " P3D 184." Mr. Chs;plin, of the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-atreet, carrier, sasd,-On the 15th of May last I called at M,essrs. Bolt's for a packet of gold, which 1took awamy in a cab. On the same day I received a boxc of gold from Messrs. Abel and Co. I took the tw o boxes to the South-Eantern Railw;ay terminus at onSdon-bridge, and delivered them into the hands of the serive,ts of that company. I rn vtherx put on the scale, but did not see their weight taken. Mr. J. Chance, a clerk in the. emplomnent of Messrs. AbeDl, said be packed six bars of gold in a box, which was delivered to Mfr. Chaplin on the 15th of May last. B. Scanlan, a porter belorrgilh to the South-Ea.tern lallway Company, said he sWsisted m carrying the two palckages from the cab to the railway station, and w;eighing them. They were afterwards put into an iron chest and sent off by the mail-train. Mr. E. Cox, a clerk belonging to the railway company, said,-I checked the weight of the boxes at the scale, with the weights in the invoicesE. One box was markod 'IL 577," and weighed 2cwt. 2 qrs. 1511,.; the other was marked "1?) 4lSI," and weighed 1 cwt. 1 qr. itrib. The iron chest was locked after the boxes were put into it, and it was then placed in the traina Mr. J. H. MSajos-I reside at Boulogno, and am ca~t to the Moessgerie Generale. On the morning of the lort of May last I received three boxes, two said to contain gold bars, and the thimd gold coin They cams by the steamer the lord narden, trom Folkeshtne. The gross weight of the twro boxes at the Custom-housec as 1'30 kilogramimes, The boxes remained at the Cusgtom-house about four hours, when they were taken to my office, and forwarded on to Paris. Wthile at my office the boxes were not locked up they were not out of my sight, hut wrere placed in the office where business is transac-ted, in front of the desk. It is imRcsible that anybody could have meddled with them whl3e they were in my ofiTce. H. Pierre F. Beznard, clerk in the employment of Messrs. Lyon, Alemand, and Co., bullion dealers, Pans, was examined through the medium of an interpreter, and said,On the Cth of May last, I opened a box at our establishment, marked " L 577." and found it to contain 16 bags of lead and 13 ingots. The box had come by railway from Boulogne. H. Charlemnagne Everard.-Iam partner and cashier in the house of Pockar Dufour, and Co., banl-ers, at Paris. A box marked "P )" arrived at our establishment on the 16th of 3May, and was opened on the 18th in the presence of a commissary of polce, whose attendance I requested in consequence of having heard that a box of gold consigned to another firm had been plundered. On opening my box I found it to contain 17 bags of small shot, and no gold. The shot was shown to several persons, and proved to be of English manufacture, ans were also the bags containing it. Mr.E. Syrett, clerk to Messrs. Johnson and Sons, assayers, of Basinghall-street, said,-Wo keep a box on our preniises in which gold intended to bo assayed isplaced. On the 2'tli uit. I found in that box a paper containing two mall parcels of gold. It is usual when metal is left to ho assasyed that the name of thee person selling should be written upon the paper. Ifin uthe name of Douglas upon the paper in question,. The assay of the gold was abcout a carat better than the standard. Mr. J. Johnson, jun.-My attention vws caUed by the last witness to severalpieces of gold that were sent to us to be assayed. The name of Douglas was written onthie fiece of paper enclosing them. Mr. G. H. Johnson, father of the last witness, said-The parcel spoken of by my son was brought to our homue on the 28th ult. and was delivered baek on the 31st. I did not take notice of the person to whom itwasdelivered. (A card with the name of Douglas engraved on it asw shown to tire witness.) This card, I think, was given to me by a party who called upon me onthe 28th, and who brought a bar of gold to be ass;ayed; rfter an assaywvas cut off the bar wats returnedtothe party, andonmyasking himn his name he gave ine the card yon have just shown me. Mrr. James Johnson, of the firm of Johnson and Walker, gold-refiners, Aldergate-street, said,-I have already spoken to some purchasesI mnade of the proner of gold, and I find that I made an additional purchase of him on the 28th of November. I then bought of him 25oz. 15dwts. tr.9 of gold, for which I paid him 78L 5s. 9d. Its qualty was 4 carats 2 grains worse than the standard. On the 316t ult. tlheprisoner came to our shop, when I paid him 92'. 1SS. 21. for abar of gold. On that occasion he showed me a piece of paper which I found to contain four or five smaU piecer of gold. I looked particularly at the paper, and noticed that the qaality of the gold wasmarked on it, as woll as the name of "Dnuglas ' in penciL. There was also the naame of " Johnson and Soc, Basiughall-street," stamlped on the ppsper. I should say th3t the writin" wars Messrs. Johnson's. The prisoner said, " I may as well hurn this" (thre paper), and hie did so. The witness then identified two 50.-notes which he paid the prisoner, and which, among others, were found at his (the prisoner's) house by the officers. 3Mr. J. D. Sutcliffe.-I amn a gold refiner in Long-aere. On the 28th mit. I purchased 27oz. 7dwts. of gold of a person, for -which I gave 1071. 1os. The prisoner is not the person of whom I made the purchase. This witness also identified three Bank of England notes for 50?., 20!., and 101., found by the ofnicers at the prisoner's house, as haling been paid by him. Mr. J. Rutherford, clerk to 3r. Denham, gold refiner. Barbican.-On the 28th nlt. I bought a bar of gold of a person, not the prisoner, for 103?. 13s 2. I gave the seller nine 101. and two 51. Bank of England notes. (These notes were also found by the officers at the house of the prisoner.) The person who brought the gold gave me his card, with Douglas and Co." on it. J.!Brett, city detective officer.-On the Ist intt. Isearehed the prisoner's house, and found there all the Bank-notes produced to-day, numbering 18, except one, which was a 1O?.-note, and was found by my brother officer. Baydon. Mr. G. P. Alcock.-I am a refiner in Coxs-Court. I remember a person bringing me a bar of gold on the 29th ttIt. It ismy belief that the prisoner is the man who brought it. I told him I did not assay gold, and referred him to Johnsons, the assayers. I noticed that an assay had been taken from a corner of the bar. When he asked me to assay it, I said " Why do you want it assayed again ? It has been already assayed." He replied that that assay had been made for his own private use. I should say the bar weighed about26oz. or27oz. I think it wasAustraliangold. It was very clean. and hadbeen very nicely melted. Ihad nothing to do vith the gold. Mr. Bodkin.-Itis only common justice to Messrs. Johnson and Walker, and the other gentlemen, that I should state that they have given every facility to this investigation. Mr. Ballantine applied that his client might be admitted to bail, upon which Brett, the detective officer, stepped into the witnets-box andsaid,-I hold in my hand a certificate ofa truebill which was found against the prisoner on the 1st of Mtarch, 1841, for receiving a gold watch of the value of 1S8. The prisoner had been remanded three or four times at the Greenwich Police-court. 3Be was committed on the charge, but admitted to bail, himself in 2001., and two sureties in 1001. each, and has never surrendered. In answer to 3r. Ballantine the witness stated that the prisoner had been livingin the house he at present occupied and had passed by his right name several years. The Loan M.vYon refused to take bail, and subsequently evidence was given by a manwho was a metropolitan policeman at 1841 as to the facts stated in the certificate obtained from the Clerk of the Peace for the Cityof London, and the prisoner was remanded on the former charge, and committed for trial on the latter. Bow-s=ss.-A Post-offide letter-carrier, named Thomas Foster, was charged with stealing two letters containing the first and second bhlves of five 51.-notes. Complaint having been made to the Post-office authorities that two letters contnining the first and secondhalves of five 51.-notes, which had been posted on different days by Mr. Grundy, a t-ade-Ian at 3Laichester, addressed to ldessrs.

Buchanan, mat culerlgth been pub! hshed. We feel obliged to the Senate for calliug for ant giving it publicity, for it fuDy justifies all that r:o hsa neetoforo said on the vexed question of the Mosquito pr. tectorat. We therefore hope that his Lordship's letter c e generally pubishcd and read by the peoile of this country. What iz3 the main object and drift of this. des atch 'Wby, to 11npress upon the Americau Government, ehroneh 3r. Crampton, that England does not desire to keep up tiha rotectorate; to lament that the convention eltered into o Mr. Webster and 31r. Crampton to put an end to it was not completed; and to point out a new plan by which all matters could be reqonciled, and England honourably divest herself of the burden of protecting theseunfortumntepeople. And his Lordship conc'udes withadeclarationthatEnglan abid.e b tthe Claytn and Bulwer treaty of I850. lict us reprodaucc here a couple of sentencm Lord John says*- I Great Britain, instead of having an interest in the sle. fence of the Mosquito Indians, for the sakc of rescuing past of the territory of Central America from Spanish control and obtaining an outlet for her commerce, ais no other in. terest in MIosquito than, that which is derived from an. honourable regard for her old connexion with the Indianx nation o3f Moeshito. "HIer MfajestWs Government has, for several years, en. 4xvoured to suit her engagements to the atered circnuu Stancs of the case; iut every propoal that has been madte iH theis pie has incountered some insuperable obsacle. The contentions in Centrsl Ameria a between Nicaratua, Costi Ric and Hponduras, the ab.ensce of any authority writh which any permnnent agreemnent could he madc, utnfounded jealousies of Great Britain, and vaous other tirtemsiances,1ade prevented afttlementof thisbenadtious question." Ho then proceeds to indicate further p lana for accommodating tlie entire matter, a plan, as rell aM thait embr.aced. in Mlr.

Nay, even at this hour, if the American Cabinet will come forward and cordially 'eet England, tho difSculty can bent once arranged. Great Brittin, we again repeat, does not deaire tc retain thisprotection a moment longer than is neces. sary to enable her to leave tbepoor peoplenotaltogether in a helpless, destitute, and unprotected state. ILord CLarendon, hast reiterated this in his despatches. As soon as the protectorate is cast aside, there remains nothing to settle in regard to Central America but the occupation of the Bay of Isands; andthis point, itappears to us, is equally susceptible of arrangement and settlement on friendly-and honourable terms to both parties. The cor-i struction upon tbe treaty of 18iO by the American 6ovcrnment is, that Great Britain, wien bse engaged not to hold, settle, or colonize any part of Central America bound bhrself to abandon certain islands which she then possessed and had long held, although the treaty specificd no such mtipulis tion. lgor, bad it been intended that Ruatan and o;thet islands should be surrendered, would not sueb intention, have been covenanted forin the instrumnent? Inal suits at law, in all diplomatic discussions and treaties Whero tern-itory is concerned, possesbion is held to be of paramount iinportance. This beemg known to everybody, we have a right to know why such a usage wis dispensed with in the present case. Can it reallv bc ontended for, that a transfer or surender of real property, or what is of higher value, national territosy, is made oblig"atory by implication and inference ' Certainly ot. No surreader in such cases Can be de. nanded unless provided for and expressly stipulated in the p, rTs signed. ut, notwitestandingall this, England here again has made a conce;sion; she has offered it or isready to offer, if we nar sightly informed, to leave this point to a third and friendly Power. That is to say, she will abandon all argument, she will not insist upon ad&ermg to the let'er of the treaty, if a third party decide against her. She is willing to put this question to any hononrable and ncutral Power,and to abide by the answer. What is the real intent and meaning of the treaty, and what the fair and honest construction to put orn its words? Can anything be fairer than this, or can 1Dg. land or any independent nation offer more? And yet fr. C<layton, in his recent extraordinary speech in the Senate, charges the British Goeernment with falsehood, shuffling dishonesty, of, hleaguoage which wae had never exwpected to fall from the 'ips of o senator of the United States; and b Fenator, too, who had once occapied a position next to thu President himself. Bint it may be said that u r. Clayton, being On of the negotiators of the aforesaid treaty, ought to know 'what tcas the intention of the parties w1ho made it. Granted : but allowing full eredi4tto Mr. Claton's declaration of his real belief mnd understanding at the time that such islands were internded and meant to boe surrendered by England, we must not shut our eyes to the equally important fact thnt the conegotiator, Sir Henry Bulwer, is equally decided in his belief and recollection that such was not the intention.. Now, far be it from us to impugn or even suspect the veracity of either of these gentlemen- we can only lament that they did not better understand each other. We must give both credit for t,ruth and honour, and, as both have opinions diametrically opposed to each other, we see no better mode of arriving at an amicable adjustment than submitting it to arbitration as proposed by England. This we have urged before, and weurge it stilL

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES. Sir,--Tn Sir Charles Banjs statement to you, which appeared in 2v7c X'imcs of the 18th, he refe-s to * ulookedfor difficulties in the progress of the Wor'k, particularly as to the foundations in the river." In th2s Sir Charles mnsb have reference to the foundation of the clock tower, which I believe he executed, as tho detailed plns and specific. tions of the river or terrace wall, up to the level of high water, for the whole length of the Palace, incluadirg the foundation and a coffer dam 1,300 feet in length, were prepared by us (Walker and Burges), estimated byaus, and executed under our supeintendence by Messrs. B. and J. Lee, as contractors, without Ineeting with any unlooked-for difficulties. In the appointnents by the Commissioners or Woods and Works, Sir Charles Barry iB named as architect, Walker and Burges as engineers, so that Sir Charles was not called upon to interfere, nor did he interfere while the foundations in the river were being laid, noras to the mod. of laying them. I should be glad to be able to certify to the correctness of Sir Charles Barrys position, that the Govermment "arm paying at lest 5 per cent, to engineers of independent practice for worls of the plainest and most sinple, although most expensive,character," but, unfortunately, we cannot, although we (Walker, Burger, and Cooper) are engaged in at the least as many of such Government works as any other engineer of indapendent practice. Itmustalsobe reaembered that works of civil engineers, although "plain and semple' (meaning, we presume, devoid of ornament), are oftin more difficult in execution and attended with greater anxiety than the most splendid work of architecture. The p,ce of Westminster is unquestionably of this latter order, And. yet the worl of difficulty whicl its tilented architect Dar ticularly refers to (the foundation in the river) is a wor ol nn nn. Sir. your most obedient servant. JAMES WALKER. 23, Great Geoge-street, Feb. 20.

The Court opened at 9 o@clock in the morning, and was sitting when this report left last night. Duringzthevisitwhich Her MajestyonTuesday paid to the wounded and invalid soldiers at Woolwich Arsenal, Her Majesty, after inspecting the Russian trophies, desired that one of the large bells brought from Sebastopol should be forwarded to the Castle at Windsor. Her Majesty likvewise expressed a desire that the orders for the exclusion of strangers to the Arsenal should be relaxed in some degree for a few weeks, so as to admit the public to view the trophies. Lord Panmure, therefore, before his departure gave instructions that any visitors, not being furnished with orders for admission to the Arsenal, and who may present themselves at the gate, should be penritted to proceed over the Dial-square only, in which place the trophies are deposited.

The Admiralty yacht Black Eagle has left Woolwich basin and proceeded down the river on a cruise for four days, in order to carry out sundry experiments with her machinery while under steam, which have been proposed by Mr. Westrom, an American engineer. A renewal of the experiments with Captain Boxer's improved Congreve rockets has taken place in the Arsenal marshes, Woolwich. A large number of these rockets were tested, and fired experimentally, all of which succeeded remarkably welL The schooner Queen, Thomas Barter master, is shipping at Woolwich a quantity of powder and empty povwder cases for Portsmouth, and will sail to-day. The order for the embarcation of the 17th and 24th companies of Royal Sappers and Miners for the Crimea has been countermanded by a communication received by Colonel Henry Sandham, the director of the Royal Engineers' establishment at Brompton Barracks, from the War-office, and those companies are not to leave England for the present. This corps is in a high state of discipline, the men have all been armed with the new Lancaster rifle and camp equipage, and all other articles required for this important branch of the service have been received at the head-quarters, Brompton, from the Tower. The men are held in readinessfor immediateembarzation whenevertheir services may be required. A number of convalescent invalids from the Crimea left the invalid depot at St. Mary's Barracks yesterday, baving been granted pensions according to the nature of their wounds and length of service. Among those who were discharged were some able to rejoin the depots of their regimeats. Captain G. Dean Pitt, 80th Regiment, has rejoined the Provisional Battalion at Chatham, from Ireland, where he lias made the tour of the principal military stations, for the purpose of ascertaining how the men are progressing in the practice of the rifle. Captain Pitt resumes his duties of asistant-instructor at the School of Musletry, Hythe. The preparations at the dockyard at Pembroke do not xeIax in the slightest degree. TWvo more gunboats have been launched, the Pet and the lRettle, they being as nearly as possible of the same size,-viz., length between perpendicular, 100 feet; length for tonnage, 81feet ; the extreme width, 22 feet; and depth of hold, 61 feet. The burden of these vessels is 211 tons, and they are to be fitted: with engines of 20-horse power. The workmen now cmmence their labourse at dawn and continue as long as posble in the evening. The Captain Superintendent, Captain Smart, R.N., has been appointed naval aide-de-camp to Her Majesty. The steam vessels Avon and Prospero, from Pembroke,. arrived at Plymouth on Sunday with the steam-gunboats Pet and Nettle, which rere: taken into the basin dock at Devonport on Monday, to be fitted with engines and boilers. The Avon sailed yesterday for Pembroke, with wasts and rigging and seamen riggers for Pembroke, to bring the Wrangler and Decoy steam gunboats to Plymouth, where they will be fitted with engines and boilers. The new srew steamship Conqueror, 100, Captain Symonds, accompaniod by.theConflanceandZephyr, steamtugs, left Hamoaze on Monday morning for Plymouth Sound in order to make a trial of 'her engines. In consequaence of the state of the weather, she did not take the ordin-ry course round the Eddystone, but kept on the eastern aide of the port, the wind blowing very bard from E.S.E. to E.N.E. and N.E. by N. When a little off the wind she made 11 k nots 2 fathoms under steam only,- with 3 pressure of 201b. on the square inch. The trial, as far as it went, was considered satisfactory, but the bearings, }aving become slightly, heated sh e returned to port. Another trip w be ade shortly.

After the parade on fonday of the Kin's County Rifles, now stationed in Birr, they were addressed by IletenantColonel Bernard. The gallint Colonel said that Major Tinley, of the 21st Fusileers, was present to reoeive such of them as were willing to give their servioes in the line. He hoped that ruany of them would do so, and that they would, if opportunity was given theum, distinguish themselves, as several of their former oourades had already done in the Crimea, particulArly at the attack on the Great Redan in September last. A considerable umber of young fellows stepped forward and were loudly cbeered, 24 of whom nave been passed by the medical and superintending field-officer, makcing. swth 1S1 given since the enbodibment of the regiment in April last, 155 men to the regular service.

The Spanish steamer Guadalete, which anchored in Gibraltar-bay on the Gth, landed at Algesiras upwards of 300 Spanish infantry soldiers from Cadiz to relieve an equal numberfromtheformergarrison. Therelievedtroops wereconveyed by the same steamer to Cadi7. This mode of conrevance, by steam,is solely attributableto the bad state theroads were iu between the two places, occasioned by the continued heavy rains. Her Mlajesty's screw steam corvette Cossacl prrived at Gibraltar from England on the morming of the 8th inst., on an experimental trip to the Mediterraneun.

THE LioNsDo ORPsEa AsuLuas-The 41st anniversary festival of the London Orphan Asylunm at Lower Clapton vas celebrated on Tuesday evening by a grand banquet at the London Tavern. The chair was taken by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge. Hris oyal Highness was supported by the Rev. Dr. Croly and a large number of influential gentlemen. The London Orphan Asylum is well known as one of the most useful and respectable institutions around the metropolis. From the report lately printed, it appears that since the general meeting of 18Sa 60 children have left the institution, 3 have died, and 77 have been admitted-viz., $ by porchase, 3 by free presentations through the Commandersn-Chief, as orphans of non-commissioned officers whose fathers have fallen in war, and 66 by election. At the present time, vith the 30 children elected on the 28th ult., there will be 426 orphans (137 girls and 289 boys) under the protection of the charity, mnaing the total number benefited by it 2,258. In addition to this arangements are pending with the authorities of the Horse Guards for the free admission of the three other children of non-commissioned officers as sanctioned by the subscribers. Vhile the legacies are fewer than in 1854, the annual subscriptions are slightly in excess, a proof of the undiminished attachment and confidence of the public; "although it must be borne in mind," proceeds the report, "as an incentive to renewed exertions, that the -housekeepmg expenses are now unsually large, the cost of bread andmeatbeing l,0001 more than in the year 1853, and nearly 4001. in excess of the amount paid for the same articles in 1554; and, but for special efforts last year, the expenditure would have exceeded the receipts by 1,250' Even in ordinary seasons, the income arising from volmntary subscriptions and interest on funded property is wholly inadequate to the necessary outlay; it is therefore the duty of the managers to make the most suremitting exertions to ptlace the receipts more on a partiththe expenditure. With this end in view, the committee earnestly recommend the adoption of reduced terms of membership, w hich, from their adaptation to the circumstances of the younger and less affuient members of the community, eill, it is hoped, materially enlarge the circle of subscribers to the institusion." On the text of this and other statistical evidence of the merits of the asylum the Royal Duke deliveredan earnest and forcble speech in its support, ald the result of his Roal digehness's eloquent appeal f as the collection of parsnsnptiofs amomnting t2 2,0eap The arrangements of theentertainmenth under the direction of 3essrs.

REFUGE: FOR DES1TITUT CuIrraun.-Last night the eighth pubiec meeting of the suscribers to and friends of the Ragged Schools, St. Giles's,and St. George's, Bloomsbury, took place at the Music-hal, Store-street, the Hon. and grel. Hs.hL siltiers, the new Bishop of Carlisle, in the chair. After an address in advocacy of the institutions from the chairman the report was read. It detailed the working of the several branches of the institution, inueding the sparate rnges for boys and girLs, the dayand evening sofGovsfors both sexes, the Sabbath schools, and the mothers' cass. From these details it appeared that during the past rear 27 boys had been received into the male refuge, which, with 40 remaining there from the preious year, madethe totalnmber of those shelteredsby thatodepartment 67, of ;hom 26 were at present onthe books, the others having either entered the navy or the merchant service, emigrated, returned to their friends, or obtained respectable employment. In the female refuge there wrere at present 30 inmates, and 37 lef during the course of the past year, either for service, of their oln accord, or to return to their friends ; one eaigated. On the roll of the girls' schools thee were the names of 114 children, of whom there were 80 in regular attendance. The night school was attended by about 40 children. The admissions to the boys' schools during the year numbered 175, there wereatpresent2on the books, of whom 90 wereregular intheirattendance. On the proposition of the Rev. R. Bickersteth, seconded by Mr. Paterson, the report was adopted, and the proceedings were closed by a vote of thanhs to the chairman. ST. I,us Hoss'rAL.-The annual general Court of Governors of St. Luke's HIospital for lunatics was held yesterday afternoon at the London Tavern; Mr. S. F. Shawv lefevre, the treasurer, presided. From the report of the General Comumittee, which was read to the mneeting, it appears that alterations and improvements of considerable importance were made during the past year, including- irst, the conversion of three of the central donmitosies of each gallery into open and well-lighted recesses, for t,he occpation of the patients by day, for purposes of amusement; secondly, thedivisiondof the galleries into wards, so as to facilitate a classification of patients; and, thirdly, the purchase of an additional supply of furniture, and the fitting up of bookacases, closets, and wardrobes for the use of t,he patients. These improvements, contracted for by MEr. Cubitt, have been carried out without the least inconvenience to the fortunate inmates of the asylum. Provision has also been made to increase the comfort of the attendants. It appears, further, that 177 patients, deemed curable, were received last year, of whom 10 were discharged cured; and that since the opening of the hospital in JTuly, 1751, 19,018 have been admitted, of wrhmn ,b86,tery respectable forcvstatothave been restored to the use of their reason.

Theicommittee are at issue with the Commissioners in Lunacy on one imoportanit point-they decline to accede to a suggestion of the Cormcissioners for the removal of the hospital, on the ground of the cenatal position of the present buildinus the facilities for visitaton thereby afforded to the mredica Profession and to the friends of patients, the inadequacy of ithe funds of the institution to meet the expense of reconstructing the hospital elsewhere, and certain peculiarites in the existing lease. For these reasons, and others- equally cogent, the Committee of Governors of St. Loke's Hospital respectfullydeclie to adopt the suggestions of the Commissioners in Lunacy, "wrhich suggestions," they remeark; "if carriedinto effect, would close at once andfor ever, an institution which enjos the confidence of the public, andwhich has for years succeeded in restoringtomental health more thantwvot.hirds of the lunatic patients who have been pLaced under its care." The report was unanimously adoprted, and the various officers of the hospital were then re-elected for1 thte year, nmcluding Iord Overstone as President, MIr.

The LORD MLYOR1Of YORE was called to the chair, and, in openg the proceedings, said, they were met together on that occasion not for the purpose of considering the ar. ments for oragainst the Counties and Boroughs lolice BilL The large munidpal'councils throughout the kingdom had spoken out with a promptitude And unanimity highly creditable to them when: they considered tho. rapid and stealthy progress the measure had made, its insinuating tone, and tha handsome doucezir which it offered. (A laugh.) They were met for devising and carrying out the best means of opposing and putting an end to a hill which they thought dangerous and unconstitutionaL. (Cheers.) WVhen he first glanced over the causes of the biU he thought, as an individual, that some of its provisions were desirable, and that a contribution of one-fourth of the cost of maintaining the police in boroughs from the publc purse, whieh the bil offered on certain conditions, would operate as a healthy stimulus to good manageraent in that respect; but he was convinced on reflection that the measure was deeply impregnated with the old leaven of centralizaMtion, and that it would serve as Platform for meddling and interference on the part of the ernmnt, to a degree which would be highly inimical to the existence of local liberty and self-government throughout the king. dom. (Cheers.) On looking over the 2d and 3d of Victoria, chap. 93, for the establishment of county and district conshles by the authority of justices of the peace, and the 3d and 4th of Victoria, chap. 88, which amended that act, he w-as surprised that they had not been opposed more strenuously at the time by the county magistrates. It was true an option was given by those acts to county magistrates to place themselves under their operation or not as they might elect. But the prsent bill proposed to take away that option, and to force those enactanents on the acceptance of the county magistrates, thus furmishing a fair specimen of tho aggressive and encroaching spirit which aimated its promoters. If the magistrates of ti country allowed such a biU as thatto pass into an act without opposition, or without some material alteration, all he could say was, that they were certainly not " the fine old Enghsh gentlemen" for which he took them. (Hear, hear.) By section 6, the Secretary of State was from time to time to make rules for the government, the pay, the clothing, and accoutrement of the police; and by the 11th section, the bonus of one-fourth of tho cost of the police u-as not to be paid out of the public Treasury unless a Government inpector reported, among other matters, that they were up to the Goveniment standard. (Hear, hear.) He felt eonvinced that a police. force so appointed and paid would almost incitablvy become the tool of the Government of the day. He apprehiended it wras in reality the old battle which The people in the provinces had now to light over again. ' he issue now w.-as whether the people of the cities aud loroughs throughout the kingdom were to have all power and control within thcir several localities taken from them end centralized in the Ministry of the day, or whether they were to retain their characteristic and time-halowed municipal government? (Cheers.) The Seretary of State was only asldng for a handle to his axe, ad if they conceded this mcasure the downfall of their local and municipal influence and independence would speedily follow. (ear.) He trusted they w. ould one and all uite in opposing this obnoxious bill, and that in doing so the counties would stand by the boroughs and the boroughs by the counties. (Cheers.) M1r. Alder-man L,umS, of York, said, he had hoped the ventilation which the question of centralization received on a former occasion, when they met tooppose a measure similar to this, had settled that question at least for their time (a laugh); and ho regretted that an occasion should have so speedily arisen for the municipalities throughout the country to meet together in such great numbers for the purpose of discussing the bill which had been introduced by the present Government. He might remind them that in 1853 a committee of the House of Commons was appointed to consider the then state of the police of the country; and he would repeat now what he stated to Lord Palmerston in 1854, that the attention of that committee was entirely confined to the state of the police as it existed in counties, and that not 100th part of the boroughs in the kingdom were even aware that such a committee was sitting. They wouldremnember that whenthe report of that committee was published, such wvas the surprise with wlich it fell on the municipalities of the country that they did not wvait a moment for any legislation on the subject, but immediately put themselves into communication with Lord Palmerston, the then Secretary of State for the Home Department, and came to London and expressed themselves in terms of the deepest indignation in reference to the aments and resentations contained in that report. (Hear, hear. "hey called Lord Palmerstou's attention to the one-sided character of the e-vidence taken before the committee, and naked hins, as a fair and candid nman, whether he saw among the witness.es before the committee the representatives of any of the large towns in the kingdom. (Hcar.) They also denied with indignation the conclusions to which the committee came, and asked to have an opportin of being heard in their defence before a committee of the House of Commons previously to any legislative stebeing taken on the part of the Government. But no such o-portuLity was afforded them, though theyeventually Mucceed= in satisfying Lord Palmerston that he ought to withdraw the bill, founded on the report of that committee, and he did withdraw it. He (Mr. Alderman Leeman) wished now to asc the meeting -what had transpired since 1854 to justify the introduction of the present measure, based as it was on the same objectionable principle as thebill of that year? (Rear.) Had there been any popular outbreaks in any of our large towns to induce the belief that the police in our cities and boroughs was not adequate to the maintenance of the peace and the protection of lfe and property? (Hear hear.) If there had been any such outbreak it had happened in this metropolis alone, and this bill did not propose to interfere with the metropolis. (Hear, hear.) He undertook to say that, however modifiedthis bi7l might be as contrasted with that of 1854, the same objectionable principle of centralization lay at its root; and he believed t was only the thin edge of the wedge which, once introduced, the Government would afterwards use in wresting fresh concessions from the people in the provinces. (Hear.) It was, in fact, a virtual repeal of the Iunicipal Corporation Act, under which, during the last 20 years and upwards, the middle classes in our large cities and towns had risen in influence and intelligence to a degree never before known. (Hear, hear.) The Mayor of BnsaWmELUF, in proposing the first resolution, said, the bill divided itself into two sections, and it became a question whether they should opr,ose certain clauses of it, or the principle of the bill altegether. Speak. ing, ac he did, in the name of the Town Council of Birmingham, he had to state that they objected to the bill in toto, and would not admit the prindiple of centralization in any shapewhatever. (Hear.) The resolution he had tomove was:- "That this meeting objects strongly to the apparent tendency of legislation towards centralization as subversive of that principle of local self-government which is so congenial to the spirit of this free nation, and which es-perience has shown to have materaly contribulted to advance the prosperity and promote the liberties of the country." (Cheers.) The resolution was seconded by the Mayor of SouTir'ArTON, who stated that in that town, where the population was 40,000, theyhadatpresent 36 policemen-anumber amply sufficient ; but, if the 'present bill became law, they would be saddled with the maintenance of 80 policemen. Mr. C. FoRsTEn, MP., reminded the meeting that he had given notice of his intention to move that the second reading of the biU be postponedfor six months. He thought the meeting ought not to withdraw its opposition to the second reading e.xcept upon some terms on whichtheymiht agree, perhaps, with the Home Secretary. It was said by some that if the tow;n councils get Government money in support ef the maintenanee of a police foree, theykought to submit to Government supervision. But they had never asked for Government money, and. he greatly misunderstood them if they er-er wvould ask far it. (Hear,; hear.) After all, the offer wasa mere delusion, because the money must come from the pockets of the people before it found i's way into the consolidated fund. (Hear, hear.). Mr. RoEssuvac, M.P., said, the hon. member for Walsall (Mr. Forster) had talked of s geakng to the Home Secretary atvahe say. He (M. Roebuck), on the coitrary, would -go to the Home Secretary with the determination of listening to nothing. that he might say. (Cheers.) He was sure that mnothinglhi could say could alter the ehater of this bilL. He had always thought that the political educationof Englishmen took placo in.their own localities, and that ineach localityevery man became accustomed to govern himagif and his own affairs. He looked wvith extreme suspicion npon any attempt to wrest out of the people's hands the mansaemen+, of their own concerns. (Cheers.) He looked upon this as. cne ef themost insidious attempts of that kind- and he promised them that so far asxhis abilities pernitted he wotld eppose this biU in every respect. (Renewed helers.) He was not content with. any one of its 'provisions, and ho ho,ped the hon. member would steadily adhere to h.s deter. miation, on.the motion for the second reading of. the bill, to movo the.,formal amendment that it be mead a second, time that day six moniths; but still meaming by that amendment to turn it out withoverypossible ignominy. Some gentlemenhad talked of thcauonr and good intentions of Sir'George Grey., Hre (Mr. -o uck) had.no faith in them. (A laugh.) If a man brought ferwardabilof this indhedid it with. his eyes oen; and the only effect which this measure could have would be s. retower out of the hands of the people, and toplaco it in the ods f the Government., It was the peculiarity of the, W igs to fany that the had an eterniI lease ,of power. LA laugh.) It lsdbeenhis ortune, however, to se .themn rut of poweron several occasions, aind he anticipated that Le shold csee them out of powsr. again, notwithstifiding the.ir strong vitality. If power was withdrawn' in this cueo ftjm #he ha,uds gf tbepee nd pat wuh9 th hads of .the cchtril Government, the mceting rniglt assume that 'the Poiec concerns in their several lo&iltiehs would be no better managed tbaii the Government conducted their own ,affairs. (Hear) He had. as they knew, taken part reacntly-in an inquiry into the wy in w-hich the Government Ihad managed its own affairs in a memorable Caseend of *anything more disgraceful than their corn! duet in managing the army ao body of men in their senses were ever guilty.. He was sure that if the nanagernent of that army haA been intrusted to any rmnicipal corporation in the kingdom the countrvy would never have heard of the disgraceful.proceedings and disasters which had ensued. (Cheers.) That being the case, he loolied with jealousy on any relinquishment of power into the hands of the Govemment. He believedit was for the benefit of the whole country that the people should look to- municipal governmaent. It was part of their education, and everyextensmn of municipalprivilegeswas pro tazto an increase of the powerof the people. As he had great faith in his eountrymen, ashehai faithinthemunicipalitiesof this}cingdom. and as he had great faith in freedom, he would oppose this bilL (Cheers.) The resolution was also supported by Mr. Alderman Lloyd, of Liverpool, the Mayors of Leicester, Brighton, Leeds, Sheffield, Worcester, Stratford-on-Avon, and Winchester, and by Mr. Bass, .P., Colonel Smyth, .LP., and Lord He.ry Lennox, ALP. The resolution was then put and cairied unanimouly. The Mayor of PoRTs3iounr briefly moved the second resolution, to the effect that the meeting, having taken into .consideration the bill in question, felt bound to offer it their most strenuous opposition, and, at the same time, Tegarded the continued endeavours of the Government to reduce the responsible representatives of free municipal constituencies tot.he condition of mere fiscal agents of a MInister of the Crown as displaying a tendency towards centralization of. a most objectionable charlter, calculated ultimately to subvert and destroy the principles of local self-government, deliberately,recognized by Parliament. and confirmed and extended to the people by the Municipal Reform Ac't. . Mr. DuN.r, a member of the town-council of Newcastleupon-Tyne, seconded the resolution, expressing filly ana faithflvl as it did the feelings of the municipal body to which he belonged, as evinced at a special meeting held to consider the provisions of the measure on the preceding day, and at which a deputation, headed by the Mayor, was appointed to proceed to London to take part in this movement. nhe resolution was supported by the Mayors of Sunder-. land and Nottingham. and carried umanimously. Mr. Roxiiuca, MP., wished to impress on th' meeting that the whole of this battle would really be fought in the House of Commons, and he hoped every constituent woulad do his utmost to put the member who represented him there in the right course. (A laugh.). The meetin wv subeeently addrematdb% Sit Joshiaa Waley, 1P., Mr. Sells, 3P., and the Mayors of Cambridge, Halifax, and Rochester, and by M.ldernau George, of Romisey. In the course of the meeting Mr. Roebuek, Lord Henry Lennox, Sir Joshua Walmsley, and the Mayor of Binminghana proceeded to the Home-office to learn from Sir George Grey when he would receive the meeting as a deputation, the right hon. gentleman having previously written to them to say he would be prepared to grant them an interview. They did not find bin at the Home-office, but, before the meeting separated, a letterwas received from S;irGeorge stating that he would receivethem to-morrow (this day) at 2 o'clock. a vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings, and the meeting adjourned till this day at halfpast 1 o'clock. MANCHESTER. At a meeting of the Manchester town council yesterdav, a report was brought up relative to the new Police Bill introduced by Sir G. Grey. Mr. Alderman NEn.D stated various objections to the bill, and moved a resolution suggesting alterations in it, and inthimating. that, unless the Government consented to the alterations proposed, an instruction be given to the Committee for General Purposes to oppose the bilL Mr.. Alderman WATEISS opposed the motion, as calculated to undermine, and then to overthrow, that principle of self-government which we had so long benefitted from the possession of. The object was, to compel such conaties and towns as had not an efficient pollce force to rovide one. But Manchester was not in that position; and he o.b jected to tho powers which the municipal law had given to it being interfered with on any such pretence. Mr. Alderman HEBvooD3 moved, as an amendment,- "That this council is of opinion that the PoliEce Bill brought in by Sir G. Grey is subversive of the principle of local self-government, and that it be an instruction to the General Purposes Commaittee to offer to such bill the most strenuous 6pposition." After some discussion, a modification was made in the original resolution by the withdrawal of the second clause an d other alterations; and the amendment being writhdrawn on this understanding the original resolution wvas passed in its modified form. At a meeting of the town council of Salford, held yesterday, Mr. Gibson, town-clerk, brought up a report opposed to the bill.
THE TYATE SHIPOWNERS AND THE GOVERY- MENT. SBIDfS, FEB. 19, A&ublic meeting of the merchants and shipowneas of SouthShields was neld last evening in tle Central Hall in that town to take into consideration the biU brought before Parliament by tbe Vice-President of the Board of Txade for the removal of local burdens upon shipping; the Mayor (Mr. Thomas Stainton) occupied the chair. TnheMayorconvened the meeting upon the requisition of 3SO of the inhabitants. The MAYOR, Mr. Alderman RoBrnso\s, Mr. JA-Es ArnER, and Mr. J,AMIES STmvxssozs, aU of vwhom are giver Tyne Improvement Commissioners, spoke strongly in favour of thebill, as a measure to relieve the shipping trade of the country from grievous imposts; for the harbours claiming " passing toll" were not generally suited as places of refuge in gale of wind, andwere provided for by the bill, by a due being charged upon vessels wlich really did use them. Town dues they considered prejudicial to trade and rie. The gentlemen also spoke stron ly against 'warcadle retaining five-eighths of a coal-due o .per chaldron, charged upon anll coals spped in the Tyne, the whole of which was expended upon tbat town, andwas specially reserved from any charge for riverimprovement. Mr. J. T. WA.WN, the lato member for the borough. also supported the Government measure, which he said had been conceded most gracefully at a time when shipping was not subjected to any severe depression. Resolutions approvng the Government bill were unanimously agreed to, and a petition to Parliament in support of it was also adopted. Ihe Mayor of South Shields wlrepresent the corcration, and two gentlemen have been appointed by the 'hipowners Society as delegates to a meeting of representatives from the provinces in favour of the bill. The meeting wvil be held m London before the second rending of the bill to promote measures for carrying itthrough Parliament. It appears that the Government ha charge made upon every ton of ballast dee Tyne-a charge which has been the cause of much loss of life and property by vessels casting ballast at sea. Mr. MT . stated that the cost of collecting this tax wvas150per cent. He suggested that all those rates and dues charged upon shipping taking in cargo in harbours should be replaced by a simple tonnage rate for the purp3oses of nangation and police. To-day a specal meeting of the Tynemouth Town C,ouncil was held, when the MA&YOR stated to the council the reforms proposed by the Government bilL Mr. TUnLEY, though he stated that he was a Tory, moved a petition to Parliament in its favour, which was seconded by Mr. Alderman TwTzaEIL, aid unanimously agreed to. Copies of the petition were directed to be sent to the county members, who were solicited to support it, and the Mayor and Alderman Pow were deputed to represent the council in the meeting of representatives at London. A meeting of the Nlorth Shields Shipowners Societv has been held this evening, when it was determined to give the strongest support to the Government bilL A deputation has also been appointed-to proceed to London. The corporations of North and South Shields, Sunderland, Durham, and Gateshead, have, as munidipal bodies, petitioned in favour of the bill, and the ahipowners of~ the Tyne and Wear will be strongly represented by influential deputations in london.
TH IIE: oSTER GuN AT THE lMtsx STEEL A2D InoN ComPANi's WoRKs.-This marvellous piece of ordnance, the greatest wonder in weapons of modern warfare, is pro'ressiig rapidly to completion. As soon as the huge mass Fieft the hands of the forgers it was transferred to the latheroom, in another portion of these extensive works, and daily since has been undergoing the operation of turning. The first effort of the artisans in this portion of the establishment was to turn the outside of the piece, and give it the ord. zy apPearance of a cannon, which it now assumes. Tbis, though it is not finished as regards the polsh to be given to it, proved the sterling qualities of the iron. .Bnt, evidently to show what would be the iiltimate finish of the outside, a little more than two feet from the muzzle has been Terfected, and certainly nothing can exceed the richness of the polish imparte to it, which is a further test of the-excellence of the material. The exterior being so far completed, the operation of boring was commenced about 10 days ago with a-cut of El1 inches, and up to Saturday evening about 6 feet G inches:of a cavity hadbeen made. S'trangers who are perinitted, to witness the progress of the work are astonished to see with what ease the huge mass is turned by the machinery; and, notwith. standing thocut is so 'arge in diameter, not the sghtest impediiment appears tobe imparted to the momentum of the great revolving body. The uninitiated in such matters are amazed to know that the operation of boring is doing on, so noiselessly does the instrument 'cut its way into the iron. As maybe expected,frose the great. bore which is being made, the operation is very slowv. The success atecnding the forging o f this imumense piece of iron at once disproves the~ staternents whi-:h were' made' some 'timie ago, that largo bodies-of iron could not be forged for onance without crystalliiation.' A finer and better material in every' respect 'was-never turned out of the hands of th anrtisah than this great body, 'which so far has been the admiration- 'of every sientific mai who has seen it Some-idea of thevatness of thisgim may he gathered from the followingparticulars of its dimensions:-When finished the barrel will be lh feet loan itwliboe27-inchesindiameter at the amzzle, 'or 84 inches in circumference, and 44 inches in- diameter at'the breech, 'or 13S1 iiches in circum-foreace.

ASTLE'S AMPHITBEATBEm. lNot content with the attractionsof his pantomnme and of tho " aseension" of his elephant up a plank, Mr. W- Cookehas brought out a new equestrian drnma, entitled the Amra of the Descrt and his FaiThful Steoed The wicked hero oEthis piece is a certain Pasha of .Aleppo, who, having every. thing in the world at his command except the wife of a: honest -ab residing in the desert, looks upon this excep4 tion as anomalous, and is resolved to produce a grand consistency by placing the lady in his harem. FiYut a sum or money is offered to the Arab as the price of bisi wife, but the offer is refused with indignation; thes the lads, during the absence of her husband, istempted ina simiar manner, hut without better success. lo other course therefore is left to the Pasha, but:. to carry off the virtuous Arab dame, and this he does witl. the aid of a strong body of horse and foot, playfully orderiBg that her child-a smart little fellow some six years of age-shall be thrown to the wild beasts. As for the Arabhimself, he is to bemurdered at the first convenient opportunity for his contumacious behaviour. Bat the Pasha has recloned without his host The Arab has a "faithful steed," that can do anything but talk, serving his master for atable at hismeals, fetching him a sword when he is dis. armed, and agitating his Bedouin friends when his case, seems most desperate. Be also has a friend at Court in the person of a " nobleM;ameluke," whose ears the Pasha once beoedin public, and who, though he wears a smooth exterior, swears never to forgive the injury. Trom these several causes the unworthy Pasha findb himself, when heleast expects it, in the middle of a Bedonin insurrection, andhiscdyingeyesaremnorif;iedbyihe sight of the Arab, his wifeand child, all grouped together-as virtuous people should be-on and about the :' faithful steed," who stands.. glorious in the centre of the stage. The ta7,e1eax to which this little anecdote of the desert srres as A connecting thread are effective above the average, and it is not the least merit of the piece that it is intelligible thxtughout, forequestrian dramas are as apt to get entangled as neglected; pacldhread. Terrific combats-fascinating dances-vitne triumphant-and brevity not disregarded-surely this isenough for aill ethical and .esthetical requirements.
BURFORDS PANORAMI OF SEBASTOPOL. This new panorama, which represents Sebastopol on the occasion of the fnal attack, is very cleverly andl accurately painted, and conveys an excellent idea notonly of the interior of the city at the close of the siege, but of the enemy's defensive worlcs and ofthe gigantic and desperate nature of the struggle atits culninating point. The interest of the specator is. most strongly concentrated npn the arch I details of the ptlace itself and upon theP1rench assanlt of the3mlLald2ofi; vhich is admirably brought ont. Our less feortuate attemnpt on the Redan is, perhaps prudently shrouded in the cloud. of batle, hut the combined operations of that memorableday are represented with 3 justness of proportion and effectiveness of illustration xhich we have seldom seen equalled in pictures of the hind. The artists, MIr. Burforl and 31r. Selons, have obviously availed themselves largely oEf the aid placed within their reach by IRobertsoe's admirable pliotographs, ana they are also much indebtedfor the success which they haTe achieved to skretches placed at their dispoaLl by Captain Verschoyle, of the Grenadier Guards. The-- public will be enabled to form a better ap,p:eciation of the, si ege and what Sebastopol really is byvn tisi this panoramo than can be gathered from any other eshibiteon of thce 1kind now openin london.
