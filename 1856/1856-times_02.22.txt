The report of the amendments in the Trial of Offences Bill w areed to. TmE CREEAN COM1 ES SSIONwERS' REPORT. lord PiANNURE-My lords, before we proceed to the ather buuinew of the evening, I think it my duty to inform you that Her Majesty, by the advice of her Ministers, has appointed a board of general officers to inquire into the matter6 adverted to in the report of the commissioners who were Sent to the Crimea to make certain inquiries. This board is to receive explanations on the subject of complaints made by ofricers who have been adverted to in that report, and to inquire into dl the circumstances connected therewith. The EArl of HARDWICKE.-I think the step now taken by Her Majesty's Government is one which ought to bave beentaken longago. Inmyopinion, the momentthat report was in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief the natural and proper course for him to have pursued was to order a court of inquiry into the conduct of the officers who have been alluded to. I think the situation in which these officers have been placed is one of great pain and diffliculty. They have been obligedto bear the obloquy of publio opinion, andto redress their own grievances with their own hands in the public prints-a conrse which I think is derogatory to the government of the army, and dangerous to the discipline of the public service. I think the course which should always be pursued in military maatters Ls, that those who enter the mnlitary ervice and place themselves under martial law should receive. in return that protection and support to which they were entitled on having yielded themselves to the public service and its severe discipline. These officers were entitled to call for a searching inmestigation into their conduct, and if that was not granted they should be reieaed by the acts of the public officers from a position so painful. Iexprees no opinion as to the conduct of those officers or as to matters which occurred in the Crimes, but I have stated the course which generally is and should be pursued in the military service. Lord PANHM E.-I think it would have been as well if the noble earl had made himself acquainted with the facts of the cae before saying that the Government ought to have taken this step long go. The Government was not in Vodesion of the information to enable them to take this step until the 20th of lsst month. It is very true that the firast report of the commissioners arrived in this country about the latter enA of June last; but it was a bald, nak-ed report, relting entirely to the Commissariat Department, with one sentence only referring to any military officer, and was unaccompanied by any evidence, and therefore not at all in a condition for the Government to act upon. The second and main portion of the report, together with the evidence, was only placed in my hands in print on the 20th of January. The commission was appointed under very peculiar circumstances by the Government, in order to colIect information as to the state of the army and the supplies of food and forage. The House of Commons and your lordships were informed at the time that the Government relied very much on the information received by those corn. Inissioners to counteract the state of things then existing; and, altogether, the manner in which the commission was appointed, and the manner in which it was announced, led the public justly to expect that the report of the commissioners, as well as the evidence, would be laid in full before them. I have laid that report and the evidence in its integrity before the public and now, if certain officers find themselves aggrieved by the report of the commissioners, it is no fault of mine if some of those officers think their position would be most improved by publishing their defences immediately. I do not think they have done eitherharm or good by so doing; but a board of general officers, totally unconnected with affairs in the Crimea, has been appointed to inquire into the allegations of the comXinsioners' report, and to hear the defences, or, I should r3ther say, the explanations, of those officers who conceive themselves aggrieved by that report. I shall carefully abstin from giving any opinion as to those allegations, but the Government consider they have taken a proper course in institufng the inquiry whiieh I have announced as about to tzke place. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH-Are these general effloiers to examine witnessex? Lord PAINTURE-Yes. The Earl of ELL&NBOROUGHSome of the witnesses examined by the first commission may be still in the Crimea. The report will be very unsatisfactory if it is not accompanied by the evidence of the same witnesses in the former report. Lord PANM UMI-These general officers wil have the same power of taking evidence and satisfying themselves npon the matters adverted to as the commissioners in the Crimea had. Earl G=E.-I can't help thinking this is a subject of great importance, and that it is very unfortunate that it has been brought before the House in this incidental manner. I am etretmely sorry to hear the statement which has just been made, because I cannot help fearing that it will Ie a very irregular proceeding, and may lead to very serious consequences. A commission of inquiry is about to be appointed. Now, I hope the objects of that Commission will bh clearly defined. I understand a comruittee of inquiry where there are specific charges against officers for having acted improperly, as was alleged at the Convention of Cintra; but, as far as I am aware, there is no eArge against officers serving in the Crimea, except that they have failed in evincing the energy and judgment in the performance of their duty vnich they ought to have exhibited. I believe no one has imputed to these officers any intentional fault. Surely it will be a very vague and difficultinquiry whether more or less skill, more or less judg3nent, or more or less energy has been displayed. For my part, I think the proceeding is altogether unprecedented, and liable to lead to dangerous results. It seems to me this difiEcultvhasarisenfroinaveryunfortunatemLntale.Mynoble hrend has slated that the complete report of the commissioners did not reach his hands till the 20th of January. Then, I say, itis to be regretted that it was laid so soon before Parliament. (Hear, hear.) As far as I have had any eperience of the mode in which the Government deals with rep orts of iportant commissions, the course has invariably been this Wh-%en the report is received Her Majesty s Government c.arefully consider whether the inquiry is complete and satisfactory, or whether further inquiry is necessary, and, if it be complete and satisfactory, what steps ought to be taken u,pon it. In laying the report of a commission before Parliament it is slto declare what judg. ment Hler Majesty's Government have formed on that report, and what coue they propose to adopt in consequence. But, my lords, we are now placed in a very embarrassing position. This report appears to bear hardly on certain officers. Iord PANNMURE.-I did not say that. Earl GREY.-My noble friend says he did not say that. There is some reasonforfurtherinquiry. Either the report bears hardly upon certain officers, or thev have not had sufficient opportunity of explanation. (Hear, hear.) Well, then, I say, injustice to those officers, if there be anything in this report reflecting on them, upon which they ought to be heard, the opportunity of explanation should have been given before the report was produced and before an ezparte statement, as it must be supposed to be, was laid beforeParliament. (Hear, hear.) I say, also, it is a reflection upon the commissioners, after their report has been made public, to make it the subject of firther inquiry. (Hear, hear.) implies that Her Majesty's Government, who selected these commissioners, are not satisfied with the manner in which they have performed their duties. fHeair_) lar not able to express an opinion whether further inir is necessary.. I have read the report, but not the evidec which accompanieti it. I should therefore be sorry to express an opiniGn; but I do say, if further investi-gation is necessary, the report should have been withheld until that futer investigation wvas completed. (lIear, hsarl) Earl GRANVTLLE.-I think the POInts raised by the noble ciarl are three. He objects to the course taken by the G-overnment, fir-st, because it is without precedent;- secondly bLecause it is hard upon the officers to institute inosir withcut specific charges being allegeed; and, thirdly, Ecuse the GOVernmet -were bound either to make their opPinion known, or to withhold the report until further investigation bad takeesplace With regard to the first point, the want of p?recedent, beleve the courxe adoptedir,instrictconform;ty with the inquir which was instituted after the Convention of Cintra.With regardtothehardshipofcallingu,pon officer to answer charges, not peifie, that maight ho properly nred against proceedings by ourt-nuariaI; hut the chief object of thi court of inquiry is to enable certain officers to relieve themselves of imputations which they consKider are case upon them without proof. W-ith re$rd to the Govemnrnent withholdinq the report, 'the rpubi ol aefl ag27rieved ifsuch information as the report contained had anot been publisihed, and, in fact, the Government has acted upo the report, as far as reined certain evils connecekd withhe comnmissariat. (Hear,be-) LordEBROUGHA3L-I see great dfifficulty in ths m ceeinK an wsh o cll heparicuarattention of your lorisipstowha hs benstaedby henoble eal near me ation of evidence, chiefEy, if not entirely, obtained upon the spot. There is dissatisfaction expressed by some parties or otherswith the result of the inqmry as contained in that report, and this dissatisfaction gives rise to the appointment of a board of general officers, who are to review the proceedings before the commissioners, to take into consideration their report and the evidence on which it is founded, and to pronoince their opinion by a second report upon the same subject, either confirming, differing from, or altn the judgment of the two commissioners. But, infortunat y, as mynoble friendstates, the boardof generalofficers must rely on totally different evidence, because they are not to go out to the Eas, for thepurpee of examining witnesses there, as was done by the ond commissioners. They are to examine witnesses here. My noble friend the President of the Council reminds us of proceedings after the Convention qf Cintra, and thinks that z good answer to those Who say there re no formal charges which the board of officers can investigate. But, in the case of the inquiry after tho Convention of Cintra, which was instituted because of the general discontent in the country there had been no previous inquiry, no previous decision, no report come to by other authorities. t vas not at all in thenature of an appeal It was an original proceeding by which inquiLry wa1S first mnade wrhetherval had been done whichought to have been done-whether tho Convention of Cintra ought to be approved-and wvhether tho conduct of persons before and in that oonvention ought to be sanctioned. If an inquiry had been instituted on the spot -at Cintra, or at Lisbon, or anywhere in Portugal-if that inquiry had led to the examination of witnesses, and had gven isetoa report, and that report, being objected to, had been sent to a board of generil officers to review, the cases would have been somewhat paralleL But, as the facts stand, it seems to me there is no similarity between them. I see that the greatest possible difficulty and disadvantage willbe sure to arise in this inquiry from one body-the two gentlemen sent out to the Criimea-examinint one class of witnesses and the board of general officers examining another. (Hear.) You may have a few witnesses here, a few headis of departments, but, generally suealdzrhebl of the evidence will be entirely hearsay. Thc subject was then allowed to drop. - THE WENSLEYDALE PEERAGE. Iord GLENELG gave notice that he should to-morrow move, as an amendment to the House resolving itself into a Committee of Privileges, that a certain question be referred to the judges. The Earl of DERBY approved deciding, first, whether they would come to any resolution at all, as they would afterwards be more free to discuss the resolution of his noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) with the amendment of which notice had been given by the noble earl opposito (Earl Grey). THE COM dNDER-ClfE AND qTIE SECRE1ARY FO. WAR. The Earl of DERBY then rose and said,-My ibrds, the short anl somewhat irregular, but not unimportant, conversation which has just taken place seems to furnisl! an additional reason for putting to Her Majesty's Government the question of which I have given notice-a question which I trust Her Majesty's Government will have no difficulty in answering, and which I hope your lordships will not think inappropriate in point of time, unimportant in relation to the public service, or illtimed with regard to the recent changes in the department to which it refers. Ineed hardly say that, when two departments are in the slightest degree connected, two things are absolutely essential to the due administration of the public service, and without which it is quite clear the public service must sustain serious injury. First5 the duties of the two departments should be so distinctly and clearly defined, their responsibilities so ascertained, and the limits of their authority so clearly set fortb, that there can be no possible conflictof authority between the two departments in matters which relate to both. And, next, in carrying on the business of those departments there should be a mutul desire on the part of the heads of each to facilitate that business by carefully avoiding encroaching either on the authority of the other, while at the same time they should be prepared, on adl occasions, to afford every assistance in performing their joint public duties. Ineed hardly say, also, that the necessityfor thcsetwoprovisions becomes the more absolute in proportion as any two departments are brought into habitnal and daily contact. In proportion as business intermingledonewith the otherbrings them into constant conference ought their relations to be of a more confidential and unreserved character. Ineed hardly remind your lordships thatin the course of last year, shortly after the ap. rointment of a Secretary of State for the War Department, and during the transition which was taking place in regard to the, constitution- of the militia, from regiments being embodied, there was very considerable inconvenience to the public service arising out of contradictory orders as to fur. loughs proceeding from the Secretary of State for the War Department and the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The militia generally being under the direction of the Home-office, but in process of embodiment becoming a quasi military force under the Secretary of State for the War Department, instances occurred in which confusion and inconvenience arose from the respective authorities of those departments not being clearly defined. It is impossible to have read through the papers relating to *,- s .-A f tha arms-in the Crimea without seeing that mnuchof the distress and suffering of that army might have been avoided and mitigated, if there had been, in the first place, on the part of certain departments a greater readiness to take uponthemacives an auiuunt Of reaponsih;ility beyond the strict and actual limit of their own sphere of duty ulpon any public emergency, and for the purpose of cooperating wth other departmnents; and that, on the other band, dificulties also arose and inconveniences were increased, from there being at some times considerable doubt in whose department a certain service lay which was essentialy necessary for carying onthe operations of the army. I mention this only as an illustration of the general peinciple of the importance of a thorough understanding as to the respective duties and responsibilities of departments which have to act together, and I am sure my noble friend at the head of the War Department will agree with me that if there are two departments whose joint action and co-operation are more important than any other, because of their more frequent and constant intercommunication, it is the two officesoverone of which he presides andtheothernresided over by my noble and gallant friend the Commanderin-Chief. The office of the Secretary for the War Department is one which your lordships are aware in its present form is of very recent introduction, and when it was first proposed to separate the duties of that department from those of the Coloeil Secretary, I endeavonred-but I amr sorryto Eay endeavoured in vain-to ascertain from the noble earl then at the head of the Government (Iord Aberdeen), whom I see now in his place, what were to be the rpreeise functions to be given to the Secretary for War. I could get no answer, except that they were to be the same duties which had been performed before by the Colonial Secretary; or, at all events, I could get none but negative answers. The Secretary for the War Departnent was not to interfere with the patronage, he was not to interfere with the discipline, he was not to interfere with the promotion of the army- he was not to interfere with the militia; he was not to have anything to do with the Ordnance;-in short, the answers I received formed a succession of negations as to the duaties to be performed by the War Mlinister in his new office. My lords, I had for some time myself the honour of filling the office of Colonial Secretary-never at a time of war-except (and that is hardly an exception) during a very short periodEat the time of the expedition against China, when, in giving the necessary orders and making the necessary arrangements, I received most valuable assistance from my noble Friend above me (the Earl of Ellenborough), who was then about to set out for the assumption of the Government of India, from which part of the world the forces were to besent out, and from which the operations were in a great measure to be conducted. But with regard to the ordmiay duties of the Colonial Secretary-and in this I am sure I shall be borne out by the experience of those who have flled that office-all I can say is, that they were of the most trivial and most insignificant description. They consisted, in the first place, in signing warrants for commissions for any officers who might happen to be in the colonies; next, in taking the Queen's pleasure with regard to the decoration of the Order of the Bath when it was proposed to confer it upon any officer in the servce, which was always done upon the recomemendation of the head of the department to which the oflicer might belong-of the Commander-in-Chief with regard to the army, of the Fuist Lord of the Admiraltyas to the navy, and of the President of the Board of Control with regard to the company's service. The only real business, -and that I must say was the least satisfactory of any I had to do with-was the correspondence generally of rather a protracted and dilatory character, which took place between the governors of colonies, the Treasury, the Board of Ordnance, and the Colonial Secretary, whenever it happened that any arrangements were to be made with regard to barracks and other buildings in the clonies. That was the only military business which the department had to perform, and, as I said before, it was most unsatisfaotorily conducted. I don't at all mean to say that in a time of war the duties are of an unimportant or trivial character. (Hear.) On the contrary, they are of such importance and get his' abilities, andL however unceasing his attention. F or the tim-e he must he, with reference to milfitary operations abroad, suprme overall. He must. be responsible to the Crown and th cunr for the due conduct of the -war. He is responsible, in comnmon, no doubt, with the Cabinet of 'which he is a miember, for the welectionof officers to command in chief, and (I must presmae also) he is to a considerable degree responsible for the selection of'-officers to hold important commandls under thiem. He must have entire control over the operations, as bearing lupon the war, of the Commnander otthe Force, of the Admiralty (although that department is presided over by another Cabiniet Miinister , of the Commissariat, of the Transport, Board, and even of the Treasury itself-all these must be to a certain extent superintended. by him, and it is his dluty to combine and concert together the various powers and authorities of all those different departments in such a manner as to condluce to the proper management of the military oper-ations of this country. Therefore, miy lords, Isay th at in time of war the duties of the Secretary for WAr are of such an: exceptional character that he :may almost be considered for that time as a, dictator, even over his colleagues, and there is no amount of poe,and at tho same time no amount of responsibility, Mhicbma not and ought not to devolve upn him wit h referenceto the conduct of the war. Bet the. question to which I am calling your lordshipe attention is not the exceptional case of a state of war, but the orainaryrelations which are to be understood as subsisting between the Secretary of State for War and the Commander.in-Chiief. 'I should say, however, that since that office has betas esats blished theto has been another change made which has, no doubt, considerably altered the position and increased the duties of the Secretary-of State for the War Department. Upon him has been thrown the duties formerlyeformed '; the Secretary atWar, the consequence of whicis that he has now to exrcise the control formerly exercised by that 31inister over the financial affairs of the ary, and, indeed, a control in matters of expenditure over al the nmilitary departments. That, howiever, isrnerely a trsnsfer of autho. *ity from the Secretary at War, whio is sometimes, not a lways, a Cabinet Miiter, to the Secretary for War, wvho * is invariably a Cabinet Minister; but the relation in which !the latter official stands to the Comamander-in-Chief is in no degree different from the relation in which the Secretary at ,War stoodunder the former arrangement. There has been another alteration-the abolition of the ofice of MasterGeneral of the Ordnance. What arrangements have been made with reKard to that office, I confess, I am not practically acquainted with, but I apprehend that the principle upon which such a change was effected (I am sure It was so announced at the timey was to transfer. to the Commander-in-hief the same control over the Ordnance as he had previously exercised over the rest of the army. Therefore, my lords, I wish to be informed whether the distiuctionwlichI undesstood to prevail in the first instance is sti maintained and rigidly acted uponnamely, that with regard to the discipline, the patronage, the promotions of the army, and, consequently, also of the Ordnance, the aole and absolute authonty rests with the Commander-in-Chief, uninterfered with by the co-ordinate authorityof the Secretary for War? That is a principle which think itiimportantshouldnot be foramoment in doubt, so that, in point of fact, we should know to whom for support, protection, and promotion the officers of the army are to look-whether to the Queen's Commander-in-Chief or to the Secretary for War, who is responsible not alone to the Crown, but also to Parlament? When I state this, don%t let me be misunderstood so far as to say that either the Commander-in-Chief or any other person can be free from the respionsibility which misconduct or mismanagement in his h3gh office would expose him to in the opinion of Parliament. (Hear.) There can be no office where malversation or misconduct can fitly or properly be withdrawn from the cognizance of this or the other House of Parlia. ment, but that is a very different caso from the constant daily superintendence of arliament, and the interference of a Minister responsible to Parliament for the ordinary execution of the duties of his department. (ear.) Therefore, my lords, thefirstpoint which Iwish to have distinctly decided is whether, as-informer times, with regard tothe patronage, the first introduction into the army, the subsequent promotion, the conferringof honoursanddistinctions, the movement of troops, and the appointmentof foreign garrisons, the authorityrestsnow,andmdisputablyrests,veththe Commander-in-m ef, and not with the Secretary for War. There is another class of cases in which I desire to know where the authority rests, or how it is divided. Suppose it is intended to increase or to alter in any way the fortifica'ions of ihis country or of the colonies, and to erect new works, whether for defence or for the accommodation of troops. No doubt over all these points the Secretary for Wlar exercises that financial control which is inseparable from his office, and any plans for the erection of such works must of course receive his concurrence in a financial point of view. But I wish to know whether in all these cases it is distinctly understood that the initiative rests with the Commander-inChief-that he sees and approves the plans proposed-that to him the Inspector-General of Fortfications makes his report-that to him the Director-General of Artillery would make his report-and that he subsequently receives the financial assent of the Secretary for War for those works which, in his military capacity, he judges to be of nationalsimportance. There is another subject upon-which I should wish to know how the matter stands-namely, with regard to the bestowal of honours for service in the field. I bdieve that the usual course is, that recommendations for every distinction proceed from the officer commanding upon the spot; that those recommendations are made to the Commnader-in-Chief, and, having received the sanction of his authority, are forwarded to the Secretary of State for War, by whom the pleasure of the Crown is signified. Now, I wish tolnow from Her Majesty's Government who. ther the Commander-in-Chief may be presumed to exercise his own discretion, acting upon his own responsibility, as to complying with allthe recommendations he may receive, and rejecting the claims of some officers, and inluding others not recommended by the commander on the spot? I wiish also to knov if it is competent for the Secretary a, State for War, on his own responsibility, to disregard the recommendations received from the immediate commander eveniftheyhavesubsequeutlyreceivedthesanctionoftheCommander-in-Chief,and whether there have been any instances inwhich the SecretaryofState for Warhas considered himself at libertygto reject the recommendation of the Commader in-Chief, or to confer distinctions upon officers who have not been recommended either from the Crimea or by my noble friend the Commander-in-Chief ? I hope thatyour lordshipg will not consider that I am enterIg too much into detail, because the subject is one upon which considerable doubt and uncertainty exist in the public mind, and it is of the utmost importance that we shoulld have an express declaration from Her Majesty's Government with regard to it. I believe that in the year 1812 some doeument was drawn up which distinctly laiddov,n the3limits of thea uthority which could be exercised by the Commander-in-Chief and tho Secretary of State, but at the present moment great uncertainty exists upon the subject. With regard to appointments to foreign stations, does the selection of officers rest with the Commander-in-hief or with the Secretary of State? Adistinction may be drawn as r ds 3honours to be conferred upon officers for distingu, d services and what I wish to know is whetber thosedistinctions are conferred upon the single and undivided responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief, or whether that responsibility is shared by the Secretary of State for War! With regard to the appointment of officers to permanent situations, unob I wish to know whether those appointmenS are miade by the Commander-in-Chief acting midependently of the Secretary of State, or whether the sanction of the Secretary of State is neceseary and whether he has the power, upon disapproval of the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, to prevent the appointment recommended being carried into effect? This subject, my lord, is not very remote from one which has already been a subject of conversation at an earlier period of the evening. In the last few months two appointments have been made with repard to which great discussion has taken place and much musunderstanding prevails-I allude to the appointment of a noble friend of mine, whom I see near me (the Earl of Cardigan), to the office of Inspector-General of Cavalry, and that of a gallant officer with whom I have not the honour of being acquainted-I mean Sir I. Airey-to that of Quartermaster-General. The appointment of my noble fdend took place in January, IS55, and it was made, as I have understood, by my noble friend the Commander-in-Chief; upon the strong recommendation of the noble duke -who was at that time Secretary of State for War, and the ap. pointment of Sir R. Airey to the office of Quartermaster. General took place in December last. Now, m3y lords, I see that many attempts have been made, in the first place, to impugn the propriety of those appointments; and, in the next place, tothrowthe undivided responsibilityof themupon my noble friend the Commander-in-Chief ; and I now wish to be informed whether the responsibility of those appointments, be they good or be they bad-and upon that point I shall not say a word-rests exclusively witL my noble friend the Commander-in-Chief, or whether they are appointments over which the Government can exercise any influence? for, if they axe so, the noble lord the Secretary of State for War must be prepared to take his full share ef responsibility in regard to them. The appointment of Sir B. Airey to the position of Quartermaster-General not unnaturally brings me to that which a short time ago we were discussing-I mean the report of the Crimean Commissioners, which has been laid upon the table of your lordships' house, and which impugns the conduct of certain officers who held high positions i the army of the Crimea. I entirely concur with what has fallen from a nobleearl opposite with regaad to that report, for I think that, unless Her Majests Government were prepared to adopt that report, they were bound in iustice to the officers whose conduct has been im. T,ugned to abstain from laying that report before Parliament until they had afforded them full opportunity of being heard, and of making their cases known to theecountry. I thinkthat, in consequence of the Government not having adopted that course, serious injury has been done, not only to those ofticers themselves, but tothe serviee generally, and the Government are placed in a position of great diffcultyasregards rectifying the serious error into which they havefallen. If, however, a statement concering the duties of the Commander-in-Chief which I have heard be true, there is anotherpoint which has a more immediate bear. ing upon the subjeet which we are now diseussing. Ishould wish, my lords, to be informed whether or not the theory be correct that the Commander-in-Chief is the guardian of the character of the officers of the army ? (Hear, hear.) It is to him that those officers look for protection, for praise, and promotion-from him that censure proceeds; and if it he trae *and I shall believe it to be true until I hear the reverse from my noble friend the Commanderin-Chief, who I hope will speak out upon the present occasion-that my noble friend never saw the report of the commissioners, although it was reeeived in June last, until it was laid upon your lordships' table; then, I must say that withholding that report from my noble and gallant friend was an act of injustice to him. (Hear, hear.) That point alone, affecting as it does the public service of the country, affords sufficient reason for my putting these questions to Her Majestys Government. (Hear, hear.) It has been said that the reportreceived in June eontained only general statements referringf to the Commissariat Department, but the noble lord the Secretary for War cannot have forgotten that in that report serious charges of neglect in the mnanagement of the cavalry were made against my noble friend. In that report it is stated "Whei the supply began to fail the Commissariat offlcer (Deputy Asistant-Comnissary General Crookshanks) referred to, who apears tohare done everythingin hispowerto meet the difficu ties of the case, proposed, as he knew there was plenty of barley at Balak3ava, that if a detachment of the horses was allowed to go down daily he would engage to bring up enough for the rest of the brigade. This proposition appears to have been brought .specially under the notice of Lord Cardigan by Lieutenant-Colonel Mayow, Assistant-Quartermaster-General of Cavalry, who states that his lordship declined to accede to it, as he had previously done when a similar proposition was made to him to send the horses down for hay before that supply failed." I do not think that the noble lord the Secretary for War will contend that that passage does not impugn the conduct of an officer of high rank in the army, or that it was not a fitting subject forhim, as Secretary of State, to communicatewiththo Commander-in-Chief. I was astonished that the Government, having that document in its possession, did not call upon the officer whose conduct was iminueed for that explanation whiclh in the Crime& he Sau no opportunity of affording. I say, my lords, that it is essential for the good of the public service that no communication of importance which bears upon the character and conduct of officers of the army should be withheld from the knowledge of the ConimanderinChief. (Hear, hear.) It is Clear that the Com- ander-in-Chief ncver can properly perform his duty ef uperintending the conduct of the army if documents of a character such a that to which I am referring are withheld from him for months, and only are first brought under his notice when they are laid upon your lordhops' table. My lords, I do not know how I can add anything to-what I have already stated. I have not entered into any details, because, not being a military man, I am by no means conversant with that part of the subject -but I may say that I am afraid that considerable confusion has been occasioned by the late changes -which havo taken place with regard to the Board of Ordnance; and that the brealing up of that office has not been aecom- aned with such a complete regulation of the respective rufies of all the officers as might have been desired; and, that there is, conaequentlg, considerable uncertainty among subordinates as to whom they are to make their statements to and from whom they areto receive their orders. I shall be glad to hear from the noble lord opposite a distinct statement of his views of the mutuzl responsibilities and duties of himself and the Commander-in-Chief; or, it would te still more, satisfactory if he would lay on the i able any such document as that to which I have re'erred, and for which I have moved as a matter of form, which would set forth those relative duties. I think that such a document ought to exist I think that no such extensive change in the distribution of duties as has taken Place ought to be made without our havineupon record, in the most complete and authentic form, a declaration of the new duties which maybe created, and of those which may Le transferred to other bodies. Such a document might well be embodied inan order in Council; and, if thathas not been done Ithink thatitought to havebeen done. If there shoulabe such a document in existence, I am sure that the noble lord opposito will have no objection to produce it. If it do not exist, I think thatitis a matter for the serious consideration of the Government whether such a distinct order should rotbe made, and whether there should not be such a declaration, in writing, of the duties of the two departments as shall prevent, so far as it is possible to prevent, that which I am afraid is only too likely to occursome conflict of authority, mutual jealouses, and muatual differences, and wibch undoubtedly cannot occur without serious injury to the public service. (Ifear, hear.) I beg, therefore, toput the question of which ihave given notice, and at the same time to move for the document to which I have referred. (Hear, hear.) lord PA:NMIUE.-My lords, the question of which the noble earl has given notice has resolved itself now into four or five distinct questions which he has asked, and to which I shall endeavour, as far as possible, to reply. But in the first place, I must ask you to dismiss from the consideration of the very important question-than which none can be more important-of the relative duties of the Secretary of State for War and the Commander-in-Chief-the last question with which the noble earl has closed his case, and which bears upon the report which has been made by the commissioners. The noble earl has stated that it is ramoured that those commissioners made a report, which was sent home at the latter end of June, but which was not placed by me in the handsof theCommuader-in-Chief. That report,undoubtedly, wasnot placed byrme officiallyinthehandsof mynoblefriend; but I think, when the natare of that report is considered, that the noble earl will see that is not a subject which need excite very greatly his surprise, since, with the exception of one sentence, which referred to the noble and gallant earl opposite (Earl of Cardigan), there was not one word in it which related to a single department over which the Coinmander-in-Chief had any control, or for which ho was responsible in any manner whatever. The sentence referring to the noble and gallant earl simply was that on being asked to send his horses down to Balaklava he declined to do so. He might have had the best possible reasons for decining to do so. There was not a word of evidence, pro or con., accompanyingthe document; but it was a naked report, from which no possible conclusions could be drawn; and if I had submitted it to the Commander-in-Chief, how could he have dealt with it except by asking a personal explanation and receiving aa ex}parte statement from the noble earl? The other report, which was accompanied by evidence, was placed in my hands for the first time on the 20th of January. It took me some few days to go aver that report and the evidence, and, according to my feeling of the engagement which I had entered into with Parliament and the public when I sent out that commission, I conceived that, without binding myself to impugn the conduct of any officer referred to in the report, I was under an obligation to give to tne public of this country the result of the inquiry at the earliest possible opportunity. I did so, my lords; I presented that report on the second or third day after Parliament met, and the first printed copy of it which I had myself, except the proof copy that I read, was delivered to me after it had been presented to Parliament. I presented the report at that early period in fulfilment of my pledge to Parliament and the public, and I am ready to take the responsibility if I made an error in doing so. Having stated all that I have to say on this question, let me now come to one of far greater importance and far greater magnitude. The noble earl has asked me what is the relative position of the Secretary of State for War and the Commander-in-Chief ? In doing that, he has opened up a wide subject, which is attracting at this moment the attention of the public out of doors. I did not anticipate thatthe time would arrive quite so soon when we should have had to deal openly and effectually with the whole of this quesnon m rariuaut i h,ia i aLvo o-Li' roferonco to the sabject to-night leaves me no alternative but to state openly and honestly whether Her Majest's GovernLment are prepared to abandon the present system as it exists, or to maintain it in the integrity in which it now stands. In considering the relative position of the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief, I think it will be necessary, in the first place, to make some reference to the previous administration of military affairs. Hitherto the Secretaries of State for the Colonial and Home Depart. ments exercised those powers and influences over the ad. mainistration of the army which have since been transferred to the Secretary of State for War. The Secretary of State for the Colonies was Secretary of State for War as well as for the Colonies. His duties are very clearly defined in the able report of the commission of 1837. Among other things, it was his duty to tako the Sovereign's pleasure as to the establishment of the army, and, having done so, to convey his orders to the Commander-in-Chief as to the amount of that establishment. It was his business, also, to control all that related to the movement of troops to the colonies; if certain troops were, in his opinion, required in certain colonies, he intimated that to the Commander-in-Chief, who carried his wishes into effect. It was his duty also to sign the commissions of officers on colonial service; and it was further his duty to submit to the Sovereiga the names of those officers who were recommended by the Commander-in-Chief for the honour of the Bath. Such is a brief review of the duties of the Secretary of State for the Colonies as they have existed hitherto. I think that the noble earl has somewhat confounded those duties with certain other matters, especially in relation to fortification in the colonies. With reference to that subject, the noble earl has not clearly comprehended, I think, what the duties of Secretary of State for the Colonies really were. If a fortfication wero required in any colony, the Secretary of State not only had the control of the financial amount which was to be expended on that fortification, but if it was recommended to him by the Master-General of the Ordnance, it was presumed that ho would consult his own officer, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, and then he was to be the Judge of its necessity, and he was to be responsible to Parliament for the plan of such fortifications as well as for the money which he asked Parliament to expend upon it; and if that fortification were either erected in a position where it should turn out to be useless, or on a design which should prove to be imperfect, for both of those matters a Minister of the Crown would be responsible. Then, with reference to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He, too, in his capacity, had a certain control over the Commander-inChief ; he conveyed to the Commander-in-Chief his pleasure as to where the troops should be stationed at home-whether in one district or another, judg ng from the information which he received, as to where their presence was most required. He also signed the commissions of officers at home, and in some other matters he had, and exercised an authority. Now, all those powers have been transferred to the Secretary of State for War, and it is his duty to communicate with the Commander-inChief as to the troops which are required to be stationed at different places, either at home or abroad, unless some special emergency arises which may render it necessary for the Colonia Minister or the Home Minister to communicate with the Commander-in-Chief7 without the intervention of the Secretary of State for War. The duties of the Commander-in-Chief were formerly such as the noble earl has very accurately described to your lordships. It was his business to conduct the discipline of the army and to administer its appointments and promotions, >Aki he- pleasure ofhe Sovereign upon them. But in all le nige ponmnsAn promotion it wa always and the mfgher aippointments and promnotm6ns it was alwvays, aud is still, the practice of the Commander-in-Chief, before submitting them to the Sovereign, to take the opinion a.d re ceive the sanction of the Secretary of State. Hence, in al appointments and promotions of any importance the Secretary of State shares, if, indeed, he does not take the greater part of, the responsibility attaching to them by sanceoning their being formally submitted to the Sovereign bythe Commander-in-Chief. And here I may use, as illustrations, the two appointments to which the toble earl has alluded-the appointment bf my noble and rant friend opposite as Inspector-General of Cavalry, and that of Sir Richard Airey as Quartermaster-General of the Army. With resect to fhose appointments, whatever may have been stated7to the contrar, it is a mistak;e to say that I am not as responsible as the ,ommander-in-Chiei j" Hiear, hear," from the Earl of DEnRB.] Iam quite ready, when the proper time comes, to take upon mnyself such reÃ¯Â¿Â½pnsibiiity, and I thinik I shall be able to submit to the eHous and thouabliosauch a defence as will be deemed satisfactory. (ear, hear.} So mnch for the past with rethrence to the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief. I come now to the state of affairs under the new appointment of a Seret of State for War. When that offico was first established there was no intention, I believe, of doing more than sinply to transfcr to the Secretary of State for War the powers of the other Secretaries of State withregard to the anm. It was anticipated that the Secretary of State for ar would have ample employment in discharging all the duties which had formerly been performed by the other secretaries. But, in stating what the duties of the Secretary of 1tate for War and the Colonies were, I have omitted one of the highest importance which was likewise transferred to the new Ã¯Â¿Â½inister. On all occasions of a foreign war, itwas the Secretaryof StatefortheColonies, nd healone,whocor.xeBpondeA with the generaL oMcvr comhniding the, troop3 abroad. So completely, indeed, was the commander of tho forces abroad under the direction of the Secrctary of State, thathedidnotcorrespondwiththeCommander-in-ChiefatalL (Hear.) Well, itis quite true, as stated by the nobleearl, that at the commencement of the war considerable difficulty and confusion arose from the constant collision of the different portions of the military administration. At that tiae the Ciommissariat was under th reuy, the Ordnance was ad ent by itself, and the Secretaryship at War andthe qecretaryship for War were two dstinct offices, held by separate individuals. Soon after my appointment as Ecretary for War, having been six years secretary at War Ipsa no difaculty whatever incombining that offce vith the office with the onice of Secretary of StaZe; and before long I foand from experience, that it was absolutely neces. sary to place the Ordeanco Department, so far s the ivil duades were concerned-the branches of stores, sopplies, coatracts, and rananufctures-nder the entire and sole control of the , nister for War. So strong was amy opinion upon that point that, at a time when chantes were not very convenient in the midst of the war, I did not hesitate to make that great and radical change. N~ow, therefore, we have ander the Secretary of State for War al the civil departm ents wvhich relate to the active condact of wvar-the Board of Ordnance, the clothing department of the army, the storekeepers' departinent, the department which superintends all contracts for the service of the army, all the supp]ies of the army and the inmiactufitre of those supplies, have| consequently been enabled, with the assistanco of the gentlemen connocted -with each separato branch, to secure to the British army full and abundant supplies not only of the mat6ria of war, but also of provisions and comforts of all kdnds, so that the rtate in which the army was during last summer, and the state in which it is now, was and us one which the country can reflect upon with satisfaction. In accumulating so many offices under tho charge of one Minister, it was to be expected that some embarrassment would occur in the first instance. In dealingwith the Ordnance, the first object was, having collected all the civil branches ander the Secre of State, to take care that the military branches should be put in a proper relative position. T'hen, for the first time, a great and imprtant improvement was accomplished-the Commander-inChief of the Britisharmy became so in fact as weU as in name, the artillery and the engineer being placed under his control inthe same way astheother branchesof the army. In effecting those changes it was quite impossible, as the noble earl seems to think, to lay down on paper any rules which could govern the relations of the civil and military departments of the army. The noble earl has alluded to a paper which was drawn up in 1812 as the result of a lOng controversy between the then Secretary ab War and the then Commander-in-GbieÃ¯Â¿Â½ I have real he correspondence relating to that controversy in the War-office. 17t exhibits all those quaeties of my noble friend who then occupied the offlce of Secretry at War which have since developed themslvoes, and of which the country has enjoyed the benefit; -but, eo warm was the controversy arnied onubetween the two functionaries with regard to their respectiven risdictionstthatthe difficultywassolved byan order in ouncilin1812,which, to a certainiexent, drew a very broad line of demarcation between the waroffice and the Horse Guards-a line which, as far as it ;oes has been respected ever since. But the order in uienco ettld not make a distinction between the two authorities in all respects. Sointimatelyrelatedaretheadministration of that wiech refels to finance and the adinista tionof that which refers to discipne,that it would be quite impossible for any man, however slful or learned, to drawa line of demarcation between them. ofany questions which ariseare settled by privato commnmications between the Cominander-in-Chief and myself, as they were arranged between the Duke of Wellington and myself when I was Secretary at ar-in an amricable manner; and, under any Government which may e xist, I do not believe there could be any such rupture between the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of State as to lead to the appeal po vided for in the document of 1812-an appeal to the Zirat Lord of the Troasury, or to the c hancellor of the Exchequer, or to one of the Secretaries of State. To show how crlt it wour d be to draw a line of demarcation betaeen the two offices, let me refer to the case of the InspectorGeneral of Fortifications. HIe has military duties to perform with regard to the erection of fortifications, and civil duties with respect to the erection of barracks. How is it possible to distinguish between them9 Then, with regard tothepatonage of al those civil departments which have been p laced under any charge as Secretary of State for w ar, it is extremely large, and, if administered by me, would lead to embarrassment. I bold myself responsible for all the appointments tothose departments, but I leave a details to the rentlemen who have been placed at the head of them. i thave, however, the utmost confidence in their discretion. I am satsfied that no man should be introduced into any of these departments who is not so far fitted for them as to be able to pass examination before the Civil Service Commissioners;Gards, tall care, after a man has passed through a depsitment, that he shall rise by his merits, and by his merits alone. (HIear, hear.) That is the present state of the civil department of the Secretary of Stato. With regard to the present state of the Horse Guards, all I have to say may be summed up in three words-vir., that the Comrader-inbCie still continues to administer the discipline of the army uninterfered with and uncontrolled by the Secretary of State (hear, hear) ; that the Commander-in-Chief still contmines to administer the eatronage of, the army uninterfered with and uncon*rolled by the Secretary of State; further than this, that in allthe superior appointments, eitherregimentalorstaff tho Commander-in-Chief consmmlts the Secretary of State before he takes the pleasure of the Crown regarding them, thereby rendering himself responsible for the acts of the Commander-in-Cief, (Hear, hear.) With regard to the first appointments to the army and promotions m the army the Secretary of State does not interfere; but, at the same time, I am not prepared to deny that proably l ought to be conl sidered legally responsible for them, because there is no act committed by my noble friend the Commander-in-Chief, however small or however gre, which does. not coustita. tiona31y come under the consideration of the Secretary of State. (Hear, hear.) My lords, there are no documents such as the noble earl hass moved for, which I can lay on the table of the house. I have pointed out as distinctly as I can the line of demarcation between the duties of the two departments, but am not aware that there are any papers which can hu brought before your lor&ships on the subject. There remains, however, a question of great importance behind-viz., that which relates to the intentions of the Government in respect to the relative duties of the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief It is qute useless to shrink from following out that question. WVe know perfectly well that it is one which occupiesmuch of thepublic attention - that it is discussed in the public prints, and that opinions jiave been formed regarding it in both Houses of Parliament; and therefore itis high time that the public and the army should know what the mtentions of Government are nesubject. (Hear, hear.) Hitherto, through the Commander-in-Chief, the Crown has administered the patronage and discipline of the armyi but the Crown would never have been able to administer either its patronage or discipine unless, in the first instance, the House o Commons had enabled it to meet the payment of the army, and Parliament collectively bypasdng the Mutny Act had given power to govern it. (Hear.) Therefore, while Parliament holds inits hands the power of paying the army, and virtually the power of governing it, it is useless to say that the power of Parliament over the army is not sufficiently ample. It is a different thing when you cometbo deal with the question whether the Minister of the day is to have the pwer of introduring officers into the army and attending t their future promotion. (Hear, hear.) I say that if this were to be done it would be as fatal to the existence of the army as it would be ultimately unsatisfactory to the public at large. (Cheers.) There has an idea gone abroad that the management and patronage of the army are in the hnnds of an officer not directly appointed by Parliament, and that, therefore, responsibility to Parliament does not exist. There cannot be a greater mistae than this. (Hear, hear.) There is an idea also that, because the patronage is in the hands of an offlcer in the position of the Commander-in-Chief, it is exercised without reference to the Government, and under the infuence of the Crown itself. There never wasa greater mistake put forth. (Hear, hear.) In dealing with this question it may be thatl am taking the unpopular side, but l feel confident that if I were to advocate a system which would place the patronage of the armv in the hands of the Mlnister of the Crown, and which would lead Parliament from day to day to interfere in the administration of the army, I should be doing that which was disadvantageous to the interests of this nation and to the efficiency of thearmy. (HIear, hear.) Therefore, under all the circumstances, and believingtfromr experience thatbthe present system is the one best adapted to give satisfaction in the end, it is intended that the Commander-in-Chief should continue to exercise the patronage of the Crown towards the arly. (Hear, hear.) 1 can see no constitutional obiections to this practice. None of the commissions that have sat on the subject have seen their way to any radical change of the system and for myself personally I have seen no reason to alter the opinionI have always entertained upon the question. (Hear, hear.) I can truly say that, havingbeen connected with the admiration of the army during a portion of the time that great man the Duke fellington aas a its head, I never ew its patronage unfairlyoxercised; andhavingbeen longconnected by friendship as well as by office with my noble friend who now holds the office of Commnander-in-Chef,I can publicly say that any charge brought against that brave and gallant officer of malversation of the patronage of the army IS utterlyand entirely alse, so far as my knowIedge goes. (Cheers.) I have onlyf5. therto add that, shouldthisquestioncomebefore usinamore formal shape. your lordahips wvill think well before gou consent to increase the authority of the Minister and diminish that of the Commander-in-Chief by committing to the former the administration of the patronage of the army. (Hear, hear.) Lord HAIW5INGE.-My lords, I wish to say a very few words in consequence of an observation which fell from the noble earl wiho spoke at the beginning of this discussionthat he thought the Commander-in-Chief ought to have taken measures to defend the character of the offlicers whose conduct had been impugned in the report of the cominissioners. I did not receive that report till very Lately, and so soon asI read it I put myself in communication with my noble friend behind me (Lord Panmure). To t;hat report it is not necessary that I should now particularly refer, but I may state that'I' concurred with my noble friend in thinking that the beat mode of inceting the difficulty would b'e to refer the natterto a court of inquiry, similar to that which wvas appointed in 180B. I may also observe that I desired the Adjutant-Gheneriil to state to mny noble friends whose conduct had been imupugned that I begged them to send me eopies of the report, and I also desired that the officers whose conduct had been blamed, and who were in this country, should not return to the Crimeea till the whole matter wvas inquired into, in order t,hat there should be teroy facility for obetaining the requisite information. , .~~so (Hear.) I confess that I felt great difficulty with regard to I the steps that should be taken in vindication of the officea whose conduct had been impugned. The two members ef the comnmission are men of honour and respectabiliy, andl was unwiing to take any steps that might seem to call in question the aacy of the report. At the snne time, I could not but feel that, whatever might be my private opion with reference to the report, it invoived considerations of a very important public chaacter. With regard to the question as to the respective powers of the Secretary of State for War and the Commander-inChief, I am not aware that the duties of the Commander-inChief have been in any degre3 restricted by my noble friend. On the contrary, my duties have been greatly enlaged, and are much more severe than they formerly were. With respect to the offioers whose nrmes have been brought before the public-the two noble earls opposite, Sir R. Airey, and Colonel Gordon-I can only say that their appointme-ts were fully concurred in by the noble lord bebind mae. I nmew that Sir. AIirey was a man of very considerable talent, and one who bad rendered great xerviecs; and s be had performed his duties in the Crimea-as far as I was then infonned-during the months of September, October, ana lWovember, in an efficient mauner, 1 felt it to be my duty to recommend that his eervices should be rendered available to Her Majesty at home. When, therefore, the office of QuartermsGeneral became vaant. I recommended that the name of that offioer should [be brought before Her ajesty, and my noble friend behindme concurredin thearrangement. ["Hear, hear," from Lord PamsssunE.J He and I ware not aware at that time of any allegations against Sir. . Airey, and I entertain bOhighan opinion of that officer that I feel confident, when the tume for explanation comes, he will afford an explantion vghich will be satisfactory to the public and to Parliaent. I have no desire to m.ke any further obeera. tionstoyourlordshsies. I think that my noble friend lua answered satisfactorily the questions that have been put to him. I have not had an opportunity, since I have been in. office, of discuasn with my noble friend any question r,a-reng the distnbntion of pcower, butI en state, eohra asthe duties of the Commander.in-Chief are concens that, so far from their having been curtild, I have additional labour imposed upon me. Earl GREY.-Although I do not altogether concur in the views of the noble lord (Parmure) with regard to the effect of future arrangements between the Commander-inChief and the Secretary for War, I feel that this is not a fitting or convenient opportunity for discussing so large a question. I wish, however, to express the satisfaction wifth which I hea the Secretary of State for War admit the complete responibility of Her Majestys Goverment for every act of military administration. (Hear, hear.) I confess that I heard with a gooii deal of astonishment ome parts of the spetch of the noble earl opposite, and I think great inconvenitece would arise from any misapprehension on this sbject. I say it is absolutely necesay, if we mean to preserve the essence of the constitution, that. Her Majesty's Government should be completely responsible for every act of military administtion, from the highest to thelowest, and if theyincur thisresponsibity they ought to have the power of controL (Hear, bear.) From the earliest time at vhich a Commander-in-Chief was appointed, you wll find that the Government, and not the Commander-in-Chkif, have invariably been considered responsble for the administration of the army. By no one was this dootrine more distinctly acknowledged than by that eminent man who held the office of Commander-inChief at the time when I was Secretary of State. Now frequently have I heard the late Duke of Wellington. say, "I think such a thlng should be done, but the Government mnust decide-the Government are responsible; they must signify to me Her Majesty's pleasure, and whatever they order shall be done." I have heard that opinion expressed by the Duke of Wellington not once or twice, but repeatedly. Practically, there is not the least difficulty in uniting complete control on the part of the Government with the absence of interference with the Commander-in-Chief, and my noble friend has correctly explained the worling of the system. With regard to all important measures the Commander-in-Chief invariablyconsults the Secretary of State or the Prime Minister. 'Until very recently-I believe until the year 1835-you wil not find a single instance of a regiment bemgn- way without the concurrence of the Prime 3dinister. I'can answver for that having been the universal practice; and vith regard to appointments abroad, I can state from my own experience that no general officer was appointed by thefDuke of Wellington to any colonial command, durig the time I was Secretary of State, without the duke havingpreviously asked my opinion as to the proposed appointment. I am quite certain that the same course Vas pursued with reference to appointments at home. Upon all inportent minatters of this kiind te Commander-in-Chief nvariably consults the Govrernment. If any difficulty anises with regard to subjects which are purely matters of discipline, lhe equally goes to the Government. I have mentioned on a former occasion that when I was Secretary of State a great difficulty arose as to whether soldiers shoud be allowed to wear their side arms. The Duke of Welington came to me and said, "This is a. subject of too much importance for me to decide upon;. I mut know vhst is the wish of the Cabimet." I accordingly consulted the Cabinet; an order was prepared with their concurrence, and the Cabinet vas responsible. If tbe Commader-in-Chief adopts anu wronz course, I COnten that the Government are bound to interfere, to call upon. him to retrace his steps and to purse a different course; and if the Government do not do so they are resRonsihle. It is, I conceive, most important for the best mterests. of the country, that this principle of the responsibity of the Government for every act, great and. small, of military administation should be distinctly recognized, and I therefore heard with very great pleasure whit was said upon that subject by my noble friend. I will only adathatIentirely differfrosa thenoble earl opposite as to the amount of military dtties to be performed bythe Secretary of State in a time of peace. The Secretary of State is. bound ina time of peacetodemdethe amountandesed'- tion of force to be employed in every colony, and to BpecHY the~particuLar regiments thatshall relieve othsers. 2Not a smloregiment can be removed withoutthe Queen's pleasre bemng signifledby the SecretSry of State. With regard, *Lco, to the distribution of honours, I remember it once happened to me to have to state to the Commader-in-Chief that too numerous a list of honours was proposed and to suggest. that such libt should be diminished. No, no difficulty can arise in cases of this kind, for in every matter of the sort the Secretary of State, as the or.an of the Government, is supreme. All important questions are submitted to the CaMinet and to the Crown, and the Secretary of State, as. the organ of the Crown and of the Government, communicates their decision to the Commander-in-Chief. On this. point, having heard what has fallen from the noble lord, I do not, in the slightest degree, depart from the opinion I have hitherto entertained. The Earl of DERY.-I wish to say, in explanation, that I did not find any fault with the Commander-in-Chief for not having instituted an immediate inquiry into the conduct of the officers whose names have been mentioned; but the statement I made was confirmed by my noble fliend-that I was quite certain that as soon ashe became possessed of the chsarges contained in the reportshe would feel it necessaryto gve the officers to whom those argesappled an opportanity of defendig themselves, at Icomplained of was, that the first report, and indeed the second report also, were not communicated to the Commander-in-Chxef before they were laid upon the table, and that, consequently it was not tntil after tho characters of oficers had been thus impugned that my noble friend had the opo ty of taking the course which I felt he would feel it his daty to take at the earliest possible moment. I complaine-- thatmy noble friend vasnot consulted, and thatThe reports were not commlunicated to him in the first instance; and I think it is matter of very serious regret that a different course was not pursued, and that the reports were not withheld until the noble lord had an opportunity of taing such steps as he thought necessary. 'With regard, to the statement -I made of the duties devolving upon theJ Colonial Secretary, I certainly did omit in myenumrion. some of those duties, but what I meant to show was that the labour and responsibility imposed upon him in connexion, with the army were very inconsiderable and quite insufficient to occupy any great portion of his time. Icannot sit down without expressing the satisfaction with which I heard the statement of the noble lord osite I think he explained his own position and that ofthe Commander-inChief as clearly as the nature of the subject permitted ; ana I bdelieve that explanation will help to nmove many misconceptions and misunderstandings. I especally rejoice at having obtained from the noble lord the formadecl tion of his deterinination, and that of the present Government, to maintain inviolate in the hands of the Comnmnderin-Chief the control of the discipline, the organization andthepatronageofHer Mawjstsmy. (Hear,hear.) The motion was then withdrawn; and Their lordships adjourned at -quarterpast 7 o'clock.

A birth took place on board on the 12th of February, under the tre.atment of Dr. Shorts, of the Pers. Daring the voyage the Pera experienced fine weather in the Mediterranean, strong headwinds, and confused sea off the coast of Portugal, across the Bay a heavJy north-west swell, with east and wirth-much winds, and hal; - and in the Channel east gales, sea and snowstorms.

Under the readingroom is a vault with water-coset, the only cosnnicniation to which is byr a step-ladder from the bar. Soon after 10 'clock one of the ofiicials had occasion togo below, when he was horriied to find Mr. William Tathem, of the firm of Hill, Tathem, and Co., brokers, Exchange-chambers, lying i the closet, with a large wound in the throat, and a razor lying in a pool of blood at his side. He gave istat alarm, and two medical gentlemen were speedily in attendance. It was, however, impossible to remove the unfortunate gentleman, owing to the peculiar nature of the place and the difficulty of egress, and the profession_ gentlemen continued their attentions on tho spot throughout the day. At the time this paragraph was despatched Mr. Tathem was alive, but no hopes were enter. tained of his ultimate recovery. The causes asned for the rash act are over-speculation in the palm-oil and tallow trades, and the failues in Liverpool and Bristol of houses for which he had entered to serious liabflities. Mr. Tathem was about 27 years old, and was married a few months ago. His connexions are highly respectable. FAAL CouasioN.-Themostseious accident that has occurred on any of the lines of the North Staffordshire Railway Company since they were opened in 1847, took place at Longton, on the Crewe and Derby line, on Sunday mornng. A goods train from Burton arrived at Longton about 20 minutes past 12 am. on Sunday, and stopped to take up goods. The train was rather after time, and was detainedlonger thanusual. After it had been at the station about 20 minutes a goods train from Derby was heard approaching, andthe danger signals were immediately turned on to stop it. The guard of the Burton trzan also proceeded some distance up the line, and wavedhislamp; but, still on came the train at a speed estumated at more than 30 miles an hour, and dashed into the train standing at the station with tremendous force. The engine of the Derby trainwas very considerably damaged, its forep being completely smashed and throwin off the rails down an embankment, with the tender on the top of it. Several trucks of each train wore also broken to pieces. The stoker of the Derby train was klled almost instantaneously, and the driver was so seriously injured that but small hopes are entertained of his recovery. A number of barrels of Burton ale were burst and their contents shed on the line, as wvere also twro barrels of tar; and the tar being ignited by a coal from the engine set fire to the train, and great damage was done to the goods packed on the trucks. A quantity of silks, some broadckth, and a lot ef hardware ware much damaged. Te loss is roughly estimated at from 4,000L to 5,0001. It is difficult to account for the accident, except upon the supuosition that the driver and stoker of the Derbytrain wereloth drunl-, as they appeared not to pay any attention to the danger dgnals shown atthe station; and the speed at which they approached the station, where they ought to have stopped the train, was usually fast. It is a steep incline for more than a mile on the Derby side of Longton to Stoke, and four or five miles an hour is about the pace at which goods trains generally descend it. It is said that the man who was driving the engine -was not the usual driver of that train, but was a man put on for the occasion. He wras living last night, but had not been able to converse or give any account of the accident. His name is Henry Hudson, and he is married. Rigbv, the stoker, who was killed, was a single man, 8 years of age. An inquest will be held on his body this day (Tuesday).-A ancAect!r Guardian.

LONDON, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1856. The House of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock. The Leases and Sales of Settled Estates Bill was ordered to be recommitted on Thursday next. The report of amendments in the Trial of Offences Bill was agreed to. Lord PA1ruRE notified to the House that HEE AssT had appointed a board of inquiry into matters adverted to by the report of the Government Commission in the Crimea, with instructions to receive evidence and explanations thereon. The Earl of HARnDwicKE thought the step should have been taken by the Commander-in-Chief of. the Army long ago. The officers whose conduct had been impugned by the report had been placed in a very difficult position, and had been obliged to redress their grievances themselves in the public prints,-a course likely to be dangerous to the discipline of the army and to the public service. Lord PAN-3uunz said the full report was only received on the 22d of January; previous to that date the Government was not in possession of information on which it could act. A first report was received in June last, but it was a bald and meagre statement, referring only to one department not under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, and unaccompanied by any evidence whatever. Now, certain officers found themselves blamed by the report; and a board of General officers unconnected with affiairs in the Crimea had been appointed to inquire into the matters alleged and to hear the defence of these officers. - In reply to a question from the Earl of ELamsOOUG1H, -- Lord PAMMUE statedthe Comnission would examine witnesses. Earl GRnn thought the Government was com- encing a= very irregular course, and one likely to !leadto serious consequences. The objects of the Commiuion should be clearly defined; no inten tional fault was imputed in the report to the' two I officers affected by it, and it would be very difficult for another Commission to decide on the more or less of skill and energy displaved by them. Tho Government, having considered the report, ought to have been prepared to state tho course it intended to take when it laid that document before Parliament. An opportunity of defending themselves onght to have been given to these officers before tho report was made; then thle second inquiry would not have been necessary. It was a reflection on the Government Commissionin the Crimea itself that after the publication of its decision another inquiry should be instituted. Earl GRANVILE cited the precedent of the Court of Inquiry ordered after tho Convention of Cintra. Earl GREY had confounded the proceedings of a court-martial with those of a court of inquiry. Lord BRourrAm concurred in opinion with Earl GBREy. Something like an appelas made through this board of inquiry fromthereport of a Commission which took evidence on the spot. Dealing with the same subjecs, this board must rely on totally different evidence. In the case of the inquiry into the questions connected with the Convention of Cintra there had been no previous investigation or decision. The eonversation then dropped. The Earl of Dzuny moved for the production of any papers limiting or defining the respective duties and powers of the Secretary of State for War and the Conunander-in-Chief of the Army. In doing so ho dwelt on the necessity of Parliament having some positive information on the subject. He had endeavoured to obtair. such information last session, but all he could learn was a list of many things the Secretary of State could not do; all he could aseertain was a series of negatives. He described the duities of tho Secretary of the Colonies, who formerly was also Secretary of War, as very unimportant in time of peace; they were mere matters of routine. The recent changes had so in. creased the authority of the Secretary for the War Department as to make him in time of war almost a dictator over his colleagues. He wished to know whether these alterations had left to the Commander-in-Chief a full control over the discipline, patronage, and promotion of the army; whetherthe bestowal of honours and distinctions, the appointments to foreign garrisons, and the movement of troops rested with theo Commanderin-Chief or with tho Secretary for War; whether honours awarded in the field, onthe recommendation of the Commander on the spot, and sanctioned by the Commander-in-Chief at home, were stiUl forwarded to the Secretary of State to take the pleasure of the CRowN upon them, or whether the Secretary of State could disregard the recommendations of the Commander on the place of action. He wished to know whether the responsibility of the appointment of the Earl of CAnDIGAN and General AEy restedwith LordHARDxi0E or the Secretary of State. Itwas tothe Commander-in-Chief theofficersof thearmy looked for promotion; from him they were to expect censure; he was the guardian of the charm. ter of the army; and he asked if it was true that Lord HARDINaE never received the report of the Crimean Commission till it reached his hands as a member of that House; he understood it had been withheld from him, though in the possession of Lord PANRX in June last. He allulded to the additional confusion of authorities caused by the abolition of the Board of Ordnance, and again urged the necessity of a distinct definition of the functions of all the departments connected with the army; if there were no documents defining those powers, they ought to be prepared. Lord PAMN5 repeated his statement that the portion of the report from the Crimea received in June was too slight for the Government to act on. He defended the recent alterations in the War Department, and gave an outline of the duties transferred to the Secretary of State, which include al the civil administration of the army, but leave to the Commander-in-Chief, subject to the approval of the Government, all measures relating to discipline, patrousge, sud promotion. On the higher promotions in the army it was the jpractice for the Commander-in-Chief to obtain the assent of the Secretary of State. For the appointments of the' Earl of CARDIGA-N and General ATPEy he admitted ho was fully as responsible as Lord HARDINGE. But it was a mistake to suppose that the Commander-in-Chief was not responsible to Parliament, and equally erroneous to say that Parliament had no control over the army, while the House of Commons provided the means of paying it, and gave the power of keeping it together bY passing the aninual Mutiny Act. To place the patronage of the army in the hands of the Ministry would be no benefit to the nation, and he would support the system that left full and proper powers to the Commander-in-Chief. Lord HARD1NoE approved the nomination of the board of inquiry, and defended the appointment of Lord CArDIGAN and General ArREY, as, when it took place, he knew of no allegations against them. Earl GREY expressed his satisfaction at Lord PAwM&'s admission of the full responsibility of the Government in every act of the military administration. The Earl of DERBY was also satisfied with the statement of Lord PANaRE, and withdrew his motion. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons, Lord PALmmsTox announced that, in regard to the' matters contained in the report of Sir JoxwArNEILL and Colonel TurLoce, it was the intention of Hxn MJSrTY to appoint a Board of General Officers, to receive explanations from officers desirous of giving any, and to report thereon to HZE MAJEsTY. In reply to inquiries, the noble Lord further stated that, as the functions of the Board would be confmed to receiving explanations from officers of the army touching their military conduct, it was deemed proper and right that the Board should consist of military m en only; that no officer lately serving in the Crimea would be a member of the Board, and that the proceedings would not be open to the public. After the reception of a host of petitions, Sir J. WAisrEY moved a resolution, "that it would promote the moral and intellectual improve-I ment of the wrorking classes of this metropolis if the collections of nationali history and of art in the British Museum and the National Gallery were open to the pulblic inspection after morniing service on Sundays." The object of the motion, he said, was to enable' the working classes to visit those collections on the afternoon of Sunday, and that was its full extent, although propositions of a different character had been mixed up withit. He contended, and supported his opinion by authorities, that the measure' would furnish not only sources of rational amusement and enjoyment, but means of enlarging the mind and cultivating the taste, while it wrould improve the'moral habits of the labourinh classes. In answer to the objeetion that it would lead to a desecration of the Sunday, he avowed his] opinion that Sunday should be a day of rest; but he saw no necessay connexion between the opening of the British Museum and the NTationsl Gallery on Sunday and a desecration of that day. He regarded the' institution of Sunday as one of the greatest blessings conferred upon man; but experience showed that restritive measures, far from encouraging the moral and religious tone of the popple', nourished a spirit of antagonism to religion. When clubs and parks were open, and even soiree3 and reunion3 were held on Sunday, the shutting up museums and galleries practically prescribed one law for the rich and another for the poor. The' motion was seconded by Sir J. SHELLEY, who tliought that, after time had been given for devotional exercises on Sunday, labouring men should have inducements to quit their crowded streets, in means and opportunities of enjoying intellectual recreations during the afternoon of that day, the only time which they practically had for that-purpose. Mr. PrnrrAT moved, by way of amendment, that more frequent opportumties should be afforded for week-day inspection of the' National Gallery, Government museums, and works of art; also, that the British Museum should be open five days in the' week. This amendment was seconded by MIr. BAXT, who argued that the adoption of the origial resolution would be a prelude to the opening of the theatres, as well as places of amusement in the provinces, on Sunday. Mr. MURROUGH supported thle original motion upon religious grounds, and would thror open our cathedrals during the week. Mr. Crnossny opposedthte motion. Sunday, ho argued, woulld soon cease to boas rest day if pbsces of amusement were opened, and it would be a dark day in England, he thought, if Parliament trifled with the rest day. Lord SrNLEY, after suggesting that large deductions should be made from the weight otherwise due to the vast number of petitions presented to the House against the object of tho motion-on the ground that they were the result of an or .nized movement, conducted by an influential bodyobserved that the question was not, as had been alleged, whether the resolution would offend conscientious feelings, but whether the offence was reasonable. There was a broad distinction between permissive and compulsory legislation; but those who resisted the Sunday opening did not ask not to be compelled to go to places of amusement, but to have power put into t eir hands to compel others not to go. He denied the right of the House or of any tribunal to lay down and enforce the duty which eaeh man owed to a higher power. The resalution contained nothing that interfered with religious observances on Sunday; it dealt, too, with only national and Government institutions. Excellent as was the institution of Sunday, he had known instances in which its Sabbatical observance had been carried to an undesirable extent. There I was no objection to opening the British Museum and National Gallery that did not go to stop excursion trains and lay an embargo upon stearvessels on Sundays. Mr. NArna warned the House that if the step recommended in the resolution wero once taken it never could be retraced, and Parliament might put in peril one of our most venerable and most valued institutions. This was only a smaU beginning, but by slow degrees the poison would bo infused; and, however plausible the resolution might appear, taken by itself, it must be considered with relation to its circumstances and consequences. The Sunday was said to be a day of rest; but the rest was to be means to an endnamely, the spiritual and religious welfare of man. If the foundation of the Lor's-day were weakened, its relgious observance would be impaired and eventually sacrificed. We were not to inflict upon the Sabbath-day-a natinoal and Christian institutiona mischief growing out of our maltreatment of thte Labouring classes on the week days. Mr. HAYwvooD supported the resolution as a humanizing and civilizing measure. Scientific men, ho remarked, were no party to the movement against it, and he insisted upon what he considered the erroneous notions of many of tho petitioners, who believed, he said, that the Sabbath was coeval witi the creation of the world, the Mosaical account of which he regarded as a mere Jewish legend. Mr. CAIRNs said thero was a ground of opposition to the motion from which he could not move,namely, the command relative to the sanctity of the Sabbath. If he could come to the conclusion that there was no positive law as to the observance of a particular day, he should be at a loss to understand why one day should differ from another; but he had heard no attempt to deny the existence of a law oanthe subject. The resolution only said that the opening of certain institutions would improve, morally and intellectually, the working classes-a fallacy which tempted our first parents to commit the original sin, and disobey a command for the sake of intellectual improvement. If public institutions were opened on Sunday, on what plea could places of private amusement be closed?e If these were opened, places of trade could not be shut, and Sunday would cease to be a day of rest. Lord EBRINaTON was inclined to agree with those who held the obligation of a Christian observance of the Lord's-day; but the question was, not what he thought to be his conscientious duty to do as an individual, but how far he should enforce his views utpon othors. He should, in the present circumstances of the metropolis, support the motion. Mr. ROuNDKLL PALwEn observed that the interests, physicalnadmoral, of society in maintaining this inestimable institution were so enormous that alnt .ny- -Worifoo of minor objccts would be worth making for it preservation. It rested on the conviction of a mor obligation of a higher law than that of Parliament, and of the necesity of obeying that law; but, although the institution rested upon the religious conviction of the people, all admitted that legislation Wast necessary to secure the benefits enjoyed tunder it. In other countries, wherever the influence of the Christian religion prevailed, and in proportion to that influence, there was a tendency to establish those mles for securing to the labourer his day of rest which the resolution sought to relax. If the working classes were invited by public authority to visit places of amusement or intellectual recreation upon a day hitherto consecrated to religion, it would be putting inteUect in competition with religion, and the museum in competition with the church. Mr. E. BALL opposed the motion, against the object of which he had presented, he said, 109 petitions. Mr. Wio:aAm expressed his surprise that no member of the Government had risen to explain its views. Lord PAL3ERmsTo said it was not his intention to support the motion, but the way in which he looked at the subject would not be satisfactory to those with whom he should vote. He attached as much value as any to the observance of Sunday; on the other hand, he did not think the mere opening two places of resort would of itself materiaUy affect its observance or infringe its sanctity. But those who objected to the motion did so chiefly because they considered it the first step to something more; and this was an objection well deserving of attention. Concurring with the majority of the House, that it was not expedient to take this step, although not important in itself; considering, on the one hand, that advantages would be derived from opening these places, and, on the other, that a great amount of feeing, had been expressed which was entitled to the utmost respect, and that it would have a bad effect on the moral feeling of the country if the House acted in defiance of these opinions, he should vote, he said, againat the motion With regard to the amendment, he suggested that it had. better be withdrawn, and that the matter should be left in the hands of the trustees of the Museum. Mr. Mu-Tz felt obliged to vote against the motion. The amendment having been withdrawn, after a reply from Sir J. WALmsaEz, the House divided upon the original motion, which was negatived by 376 to 48. The Delamere Forest Bill was read a second time, after a brief conversation as to its objects between Mr. WrsoN and Sir H. WraLTouemy. The Turnpike Trusts Arrangements Bill and the CommonsEnclosureBilpassed through conmmittee. The other business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at 10 minutes to 12 o'clock.
A few years ago a popular preacher was inveighing against Sabbath desecrationi in every possible shape. Not a stitch of work must be done on that day; not a foot moved, except to church; not a tongue wagged, except his own. A ride or drive in the Park, which, by the by, is tot quite so general a crime as the Sabbatarians seem to imagine, was utterly forbidden. It made not only the coachman and the footmano, but even tlie poor beasts,-break the Sabbath. While the preacher was harangiing inside the chapel there stood outside bet-keen 20 and 30 carriages waiting for his deeply-impressed hearers. The footmen were assembled at the door of the adjoining publichouse, and the whole neighbourhood was in an uproar; 50 horses and the same number of men were breaking the Sabbath in the most flagrant style. Had anybody ventured to suggest to the preacher to keep his own congregation in order before he put down all the world, he woulld probably have replied that he knew his orn business, and wanted nobody's advice. Obvious and indefensible as this inconsistency may seem, it is a universal one. Everybody is for laying down juit those rues and admitting just those modifications that suit his own convenience. The principal bane of this course is that it ends in a purely negative system. What this world, and, in particular, this metropolis wants,is somebody to tell it what to do, for every stupid feUlow can teU it what it, ought not to do. There are many thousand artisn living within a mile of St. Pauls, ana a good dis- tance from anything to call- garden or a green field. Of these at leat nineteen out of twrenty go to no place of worship on Sunday, don't emerge from tlheir musty dens tilthe middle of the day, pay an jocsonal visit to the ginshop, ana sot, sit, xulk, or saunter about during the rest of the day. For our part, we have frequently urged on the Legislature the duty of providing places of innocent recreation for these people,-parks, walks, and pleasure-grounds,-but that is just what Parliament will not do. It wil do no good, because doing good is a difficult, anious, respomble affair, attended with cost, and followed by oocasional failures. It will only forbid what it conceives to be harm, for that is easy and cheap. It acts lke the parent who never gavo five minuteW serious thought as to what to do with his child, who never had a word to say to it of an improving tendency, and very seldom of a cheering one, and who confines the exercise of his paternal dominion to scolding, beating, snubbing, thwarting, silencing, and all the other forms of interdiction. No doubt a parent who never does good will have: occasion enough to forbid what is wrong. If a maan does not sow good seed in his fields, he will have weeds enough to root up. And we venture to submit that the reason why the British Iegiisature is so overtasked with the enormous arrears of crime to be punished and depravity to be reformed is that it will not do anything to instruet and elevate those whom it ultimately has to reform or chastise. As to the particular question and the particular decision of last night in the Conmnons, we have nothing to say against them. The British Museumn as it is and the National Gallery as it is don't seem quite the places for Sunday edification or recreation. Of the former we spoke yesterday, and contented ourselves with advising our country friends not to expect "rest" in its half-mile of galleries. As to the National Gallery, it was obviously never designed for a Sunday exhibition. Gods and goddesse, mythological stories, and nude figures of all sorts are not quite proper subjects of contemplation on a holy day. MIoreover, the galleryis so snall and staffythat two or three hundred people make it intolerable. But we must be permitted to deprecate and denounw the hypocrisy with which member after member last night spoke as if a man was made good, and the day made holy, by shutting up these two places, and as if it was enough to tell people some things which they ought not to do. Mforeover, we deprecate this continual oomparison of our own metropolitan population with that of the continental capital. What in the world do our legislators see of the London artisan on the Sunday, or know of his manners and notions, and his haunts and resorts on that day? We can tell them that he does not spend the day in the bosom of his family. He does not take his wife on his arim and lead his children in procession to tako a walk in the fields or on the river-side, for there are no fields and no river-side, thanks to the obstinate indifference of Parliament to these public benefits. The London artisan does not spend the Sunday in psalm6inging, or in prayer, or in reading the Bible. Gentlemen who go abroad in the autunie, and investigate the suburbs of Paris, and MIunich, and Vienna, will, of course, see a great deal of bad taste, and even some bad morality ; but if they would take a tour this year through Bethnal-green, Spitalfields, BErmondwy, Lambeth, or even the neighboutrhood of the Royal establishments at Chelsea, Greenwich, Deptford, and;l Woolwich, so as they use their eyes and ears properly, they would observe a good deal that is not in keeping with a sacred day, or even any day. Not all the prohibitive laws in the world will make a people good; they only stop certain outward forms and particular developments of eviL They leave the nman himself unchanged. But, whatever the business of the legislator, and whether or not it be his duty to prohibit, and nothing more, we have certainly ourselves a mnuch larger, more comprehensive, and more generous office to perform. We should be sorry to see any new Book of Sports; but we wish the 376 members wholast night put their negative on Sir J. WAtrxsLsexs motion would just inform the House how they spend their Sunday in the country. We believe it to be a very uniform process. Between services, or after the afLernoon service, they go round theirdomains with their visitors; they measure the shoots on their young plantations; they indicate improvements made or intended; they visit the farm, look at the cattle and pigs; thence to the stables, where they discusi the respective merits of the sleek occupants, point out the various new dodges for supplying the animals with corn, hay, and water; then to the kennel, and set the dogs of all sorts and sizes in full cry; stop here and there to enjoy the prospect, or mark a good situation for a house; measure the girth and gness the ages of the trees; then a turn into the shrubberies, and a discussion of Deodara and Norfolk island pines ; then just a look into the conservatory at the ericas, calceolarias, and other long-named plants; perhaps a visit to the poultry-yard, or evena descent into the wine-cellar, may conclude the day. Should the visitor fall into the hands ofthe children there is Master CHARiEi's flotilla of boats to be reviewed, the rabbit-hutch to be inspected, the experimental garden to be admired. Should the weather permit, a row on the lake, or even an immersion, is not thought inconsistent with tha sanctity of the day. Should the visitor request to' see the schools, doubtless his wish will be complied with; and if he should absent himself from the company to spend the afternoon in private devoti6ns, he will enjoy perfect toleration. But the visible observance of Sunday is generally such as we have desenbed. The evening is solemnized with quiet talk about affairs in general, and pieces of music which, occurring in oratorios, are, of course, sacred. If hon. members would confess the honest truth, this is a fair account of their Sabbatical observances, over and above the services of the Church. What we want then to do is to enable the artisan to enjoy the like serenity, the same holy calm, the same contemplaticn of natural and agreeable objects, the same easy transition from one living picture to another, -if it were possible, the same air and soenery, the same lawns, gardens, woods, meadows, and running streams; or, if not, at least a green field and., a. mouthful of fresh air. If they will do this, it wi;ll be a more Christiau work, and will do more good, than al the prohibitorylaws that were ever made. It will draw the worldng man from the ginshop, instead of driving him to it, which is the naturalresultof our preent Sunday legislation.
As a mere political our de force the Commission to inquire into the value of the Crimean Commission is well enough. The Government, in fact, proceed upon the system - which hs received the sanction of the most approved heroes of the gaming-table. They are for playing double or quits until the run of the game declares itself im their favour, as no doubt it must at last. The history of this case is briefly this :-According to public rumour the affairs of the British army in the Crimea were grossly misn aged. Plebeian critics ventured to assert that English soldiers had died by thousands in consequence of the grievous mismanagement and incompetence of certain officers. VUnder these crcuriiances, after a Ylnistry had been driven from power and an army swept from the face of the earth, it was determined
The accounts relating to Trade and Narigation for the year 1855 have been published, and show results hi every way satisfactory. The exports amounted in value to 97,364,6551., the value in 1853 being 98,933,7811., and in 1854 97,1S4,726G. Thus, after two years of nar, after exertions unparalleled at the coninencement of a contest, we find the value of our exports not less than in the year of peace which preceded the struggle. As regards imports, there appears to be little change; the decrease is small, not indecd more than is inevitable when a nation under the pressure of even an easily borne war contracts its expenditiire within safe bounds. On the whole, it may be said that the internal and foreign trade of the nation has continued during this war unaffected either by the arms of the -enemy or the cost of our own efforts; The return of peace will find us with no cruishing burden to throw off, with no dried-up channels of trade once more to fill, with no war speculations and war habits to change for the more sober usages -of peace. If the allies have achieved a great result, and thrown back for a century the aggrestions of IRussia, it is, as far as England is con.cerned, merely by the expenditure of surplus wealth, wuhich the exertions of a few years will .more than replace. But the most strildng feature of this war is the freedom with which England has been able to continue her trade even at the fiercest period of the struggle. It has often been observed thtat this counbtry is ignorant of war's direct caLuaities, and -enemies say that our readiness to engage in strife springs from this immunity from its perils. we did not see, however, in former wars anything like the 'complete security which we at present en'oy. During the struggle- against the United States the French fleet was for a while supreme in the Channel, and PAUL Jo2ms tlireatened the mouth of :the Thames; British siugar islands were captured, 13ritish counties on the south coast were alaimed, anId Ireland was a volcano that might break forth at any hour. Again, when NAPoLzow was at Boulogne, when every district in London had its regiment of volunteers, when martello towers were being hurriedly built along the shores of Rent and gussx, England might be said to feel in anticipation some of the horrors of war. This was the lot even of landsmen, but those who traversed the seas were at once brought into direct danger from the enemy. The Lisbon packet might be chased by a supiciois-looking craft; a rich Indiaman at the closm of her six months' voyage -might be carried into Brest almost from under the guns of the Channel fleet; when our Oousins oDn - the other side of the Atlantic chose to join in the affray every skipper hadto look out for fast-sailing pr,vateers, with riflemen in their tops. 3Merchant ahips sailed in convoys under the guardianship of two-deckers, and the duration of their voyage Wu doubled. How differently have pased the years of the great Russian war I Not only have the inhabitants of this land known nothing of war but from the correspondence of newspapers, but even the maritime trade with ports close to tho enemy's frontier has been entirely unrestricted. It is doubtful whether a single British vesml has become a pri7e of war. Our ships have entered Memel, Dantsic, and the Scandinavian ports freely, without convoy-without even an addition to the isurance. Happily for us, Russia's harbours are confined to two narrow seas, each of which comnmunicates with thle ocean only by a narrow strait, easily blockaded. Happily also for ts and for the cause of humianity, tho practice of accepting letters of marque by neutralsda condemned by the opinion of nations and the edicts of Governments. Russia couild send forth no vesels of her own ; she coul?d obtain no assistance from her neighbours. Without a blow she passed from the liQk of naval Powers, and maritime trade, the vile thing necessary for equable commercial v*rosperity, continued regular and safe. If the Cz-A. could -ot interrupt our maritime carriage trade, he was equally powerless to influence other nations Co the rejection of British goods. Far different was the position of England in the last war. France possessed, protected, or threatened tie whole of continental Europe. Portuigal and Sweden alone at one time carried on a direct trade with this country. Our dealings with the other nations wero entirely contraband. Now we have the large and increasing commerce of the whole world to feed the contest with Russia. The enemy, whose dealings with us have never been large, now stands aloof, but the dirminution caused by her defection is scarcely noticed. Russia lhas had, indeed, one advantage of a new and barbarous country,-she is to a certain extept selfsufficing. She has been able to wage a long battlo without the support of foreign commerce. Had she been morc dependent on her neighbours, the collapse would have come before now; as it is, the suffering has been great and the exhaustion is undoubted. As England, however, has till now carried on the war without abatement of p'OSperity, so she will be able to pursue her course until the victory be finally won. I is easier to continue than to commence in such circumstances as ours. At first the habits of a long peace were to be overcome, the unwillingness to commence a strife of which the lengtli, extent, and consequences could not be foreseen; few could help fearing that great dangers were in store for thc country, and financial crises lile those of old times. But the nation is now wiser by two years' experience. It knows that the worst it has to fear is the expenditure of money, and that if individuals will only resolve to abandon for a season a few luxuries or pleasures, England may be no poorer when this struggle comes to a close. With exports amounting to nearly 100,000,0001., with a large internal trade, with little rash speculation, and with its old tintiring industry to rely on, this country is well able to look with confidence to the future, and to hold boldly her high position, whether in the field or in negotiation.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES Sir.-I saw only yesterday, by chance, the supplement of theAllgemeine Zeitztng, of Jan. 2, and in it a letter about Kars, attribuited to me. The letter in question, pretended to be coming from London, after speaking about the refugees of Jersey and the different refugee journals, says "A e Hungarian refugee journal vvhich appears in Con. stantinoplegives an extract of a letter from Generl lEmety, who, as it is well known, commanded at liar& The letter, vhuch has no d.ate, appears to have been written in the be. ginning of November, at hichtimetheauthorhadalreay lost 311 hope to save the fortress. " There is," the letter says, "a want of everytbing; there is nowhere order or judgment ; and I must say that it was my bad star which led me into this Turkish maze.

In this whole statement there is literally not a single sentence true. I not only never correspond with this imaginary newspaper, but never even wrote a private letter to any one else during all the time the siege lasted, except one letter of congratulation to Colonel Teesdale reg'arding his son Captain Teesdale, who so gallantly distinguLshed himsel on the 29th of September last by our repulse of the Russians before Kars.

As for the English officers, I have the highest esteem for every one of them, especially for their gallant leader, General Wlliiamns, whose invaluable services in the defence of Kars nobody can appreciate better than I do.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES OFFICE, FpridaTyomil. THE PEACE CONFERENCES. (ax AnU aN BYISH ThLE BApiH.) We have received the following telegraphic deptch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, FRtDAY, Fm 22, 9 A.m. "Count Orloff arrived last night, at 10 o'clock, at Paris. He was received by M. de Seebach." THE NEW LOAN AND FUNDING OF E'XCHEQUER-BILLS. This morningtllere was a numerous attendance of capitalists at the Treasury, to take part in the biddings for the New I,oan and funding of Exchequer-bills. Shortly after 10 o'clock a.m., the hour appointed for the business, the gentlemen in attendance, including Barons Rothschild, Messrs. RL and T. Thornton, J. Capel, Lawrence, L. Cohen, and othors, were received by Lord Palmerston, Sir G. C. Lewis, lMr. Wilson, -c., on the part of the Government. Teo Governor and Deputy-Governor of the Bank were also in attendance. The proceedings were opened by the Chancellor of the Exchequer placing in the hands of the Governor of the Bank of England the sealed paper containing the minimutm terms which would be accepted. In answer to questions from Mr. Cape], The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the scrip woould be delivered on the passing of the resolutionsby the House of Commons; but, The Governor of the Bank explained that lie feared the scrip might not be ready on the payment of the first instalment of 10 per cent. If that were the case the letters of sllotment wvould be stamped at the Bank. Mr. Capel asked whether, in the ease of the Exchequer-bills, it wiould not be a convenience to have the interest made payable at tho Bank of England ? The Chancellor said it had not been the custom to do so, and he was afraid it was not possible. The Chancellor of the Exchequer then requested the presentation of tenders. Only one was made, by Baron L. Rothschild, on the part of MIessrs. Rothschild, Brothers, in the following form:- " We hereby propose to the Lords Conunissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to subscribe the sulm of 5,000,0001. sterling for the loan for the service of tlhe year 1856, on the following terms:- "For every 1001. of money to receive 1121. 5s. (say five shillings) Three per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, with dividend from January last; the payments in conformity with the notice. " This proposal is made subject to Parliament authorizing and directing oulrselves and our contributors to carry the aforesaid terms into effect." The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked what that price would be in Consols. Baron Rothschild intimated that it wiould be at 89i for every 1121. 5s. The Chancellor replied that that was below tho sinjinium price of the sealed paper placed in the hands of the Governor of the Bank of England, and which he requested him to open. The Governor of the Bank of England having done so, intimated that the terms were 1111. 2s. 2d. ConsolidatedThree per Cent. A,muities, or equivalent to Consols at 90. Baron Rothschild having withdrawn for a short time witlh his friends to consult, on returning announced that they accepted the Goveriunent minismin. Theywerein hopes that sone alteration might have been made in the terms for Exchequer-bills, as the price was much higher than they anticipated. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after consulting with Lord Palnierston and Mr. Wilson, replied, that the Government could not make any alteration in the terms. Having placed the miniin,mv price in the hands of the Governor of the Bank of England, no deviation could be made. The Governor of the Bank said it might be as well to read the terms again, and did so. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not exactly at the price of 90, for they had taken the money quotation; but on the average it was as near as possible 90. Mr. Capel requested that the Government would in future communications to the Stock Exchange state the amiount of the loan at once, since it would appear that parties were acquainted on Saturday last witli the amount not only of the loan, but also of the funding, and had won heavily by bets upon their information. It was then distinctly stated that the loan would be for 5,000,000!., and the funding for 3,000,000L. If, in future, the amount was stated at once, all parties would be in a position to Judge for themselves, and any possibility of undue preference would be avoided. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had followed the precedent of previous loans. Probably it would be the best course to publish the amoant at once; but hitherto, during a long experience in such matters, it had not been the practice. MIr. James Capel said that he was told yesterday teimin,imum terms of the Government would be 90. t The Chancellor of the Exchequer smilingly repEied-That was avery good guess, but the sciuinuim price was not finally settled yesterday. After some further conversation, in answer to a question from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Baron Rothschild intimated that the whole, includinog the amount of the Loan and the Exchequer Bills, was accepted at the Government price. Mr. James Capel asked what the fture rate of interest would be on Exchequer-bills, when called in byadvertisement for exchange. The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that he could not answer the question then, but the announcement would be made at the usual period in proper form. Baron Rothschild having signed the contracts on the part of the firm, the proceedings terminated. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yestecday, 6 p.m.:- I was informed this afternoon, by a person whose authority: I have little reason to question, and who coald hardly be deceived on so important a subject, that the point which was expected to present the greatest difficulty during the Conferences, namely thatof Nicholaieff has been given up byRussia. If this be confirmed I see no serious obstacle in the way of peace. Indeed, a diplomatist who is Russian, if not by birth at least by feelng, said last night that nothing was more certain than that peace would be the issue of the Conferences; and that the Conferences themselves were litte mnore than matter of form. That such a result is owing to the union and identity of views between France and England there canbelittle doubt. The fact which I have alrhady announced of the satisfactory interview of the Englisb Plenipotentiary with the Emperor on sunday night is confirmed in another quarter not too apt to credit anything favourable to suci an alliance. On that occasion it is stated that the Emperor declared that no change had taken place in him; that there was no foundation for the rumours which attributed to him a leaning to any other Power; that to the alliance with England. he should adhere throughout; that this would bo made apparent at the Conferences by his not abandoning for an instant the line of policy they had traced out together, and which they would follow up to the last; and that the position asnumed with respect to Rusia should be maintained as firmly by him as by England. If this report of what passed during the hour and a half's conversation be correctly reported, it is not strange that the English Plenipotentiaries should feel relieved from a weight of -care tufficient to pres3 down any man in theo same circumstances. It now is the general opinion that the submission of Russia to our demands must necessarily follow from the im t attitiide of both Powvers. It is also stated that tho question of the " Nationalities" was touched upon during the conversation, and on this also their opinions, which inclined to its not being mooted at all, coincided. If Russia be really in the conditiou described in my letter of AMonday, and my information was derived from an unquestionable source, sh6 has no alternative, and the peace of Europe is se. cured for a long tinie to come. A good deal of curiosity, not to say excitement, as I have already told you, followed the publication in the Moniteur of the article in theo Siede, refuting the Russian pleading in the Journim des Dibats and which I have already sent. The subject might hIaVe dropped, but for the insertion of a few lines in the Constituionnote this morning, to the effect that an error had been conniitted bythe AMoniteur in inserting it. What partic:ular error was coninitted is not stated, but the emendation was regarded as conveying no assurance of anything, and hardly any meaning. Thereupon varions stories began to circulate, for the truth of which it would be difficul' to vouch. It wasaffirmed that a mistake was committed as to the date of the article in the Sicclc, and that what really was intended for publication in the official journal was a previous article commenting on some observations of The Times, and that the mistake 'vas made by theEmperor. His Majesty is not liable to such mistakes, and for mypart I disbeliove the story. Again, it wvas said that the article was inserted by order of a certain highl functionary, whlo is believed to have undisputed power over the 31onitcur, and that Bourse speculations had somiething to do with it. The purity of the person in question is too exemplary, too transparent, to give the slightest colour to suli a story, and thorefore it may be disnmissed. The fact more generally believed, and certainly more probable, is, that the article was inserted at the express desire of the Emperor, who on such occasions does not invariably consult his Mtinisters. Thle unmeaning rectification in the Con.. stitutionnel-and the Constitutio2n.71 alone-has produced no effect; and so firm is the conviction that the production of the article in the Si&lc was in obedience to the Ilmperial wVill, that even a formal contradiction in the official jomrnal itself would not affect it. Whether a remark will be made in the Amoniteil. tomorrow on the subject I do not know. Some think there wilL What I am assured is, that the papers have been informed by the proper authority not to reproduce the correcting paragraph of the Constitit, tioniv,c, and a general recommendation has been given to their editors not to enter on any discussion of the points wlhich are to be brought before the Conferences. This recommendation had previously been given to the SiZele. A letter from Constantinople, of the ltll instant, mentions that the Conferences, began at the French Embassy for the organization of the Danubian Principalities, continued; but nothing positive had transpired about them. Thq Hatti-Scheriff of the Sultan, according to the Clhristian population the new immunities, had been communicated to the Grand Council held at the Porte on the 6th. The discussion was stormy, and the 4th article, granting liberty of conscience to Mussuhnans, did not pass; and tlhe letter adds that, even if it had passed, no Minister would have ventured to execute it. Letters received at Constantinople from Vienna speak of peace as of afait accompli. Aali Pasha, the Ottoman Plenipotentiary, arrived last night at Marseilles, and is expected in Paris to-morrow early. The Constitutiounecl states that the steamer on board of which the Ottoman Plenipotentiary embarked for France at Constantinople, being delayed by contrary winds, was not expected at Marseilles before Thursday or Friday. The opening of the Peace Conferences has been consequently postponed until Monday, the 25th. Count Orloff, on the other haud, will not reach Paris before Friday, and as those two Plenipotentiaries will have to be previously presented to the Emperor, the in. auguration of the Conferences could not possibly take place on the 23d. The grand concert which Count Walewski intended to give in the evening has been likewise put off until Monday. The hall in which the Plenipotentiaries are to meet occapies the centre of the ground floor of the Hotel of Foreign Affairs looking on the quay. A spacious round table, covered with a green carpet, and surrounded with 14 gilt arm chairs, is placed in the centre of the saloon, whiclh is adorned with fulllength portraits of the Emperor and Empress, and a magnificent white marble bust of Napoleon I., 'standing on a gilt console table. Two secretaries are to assist at the Conferences, which accounts for the presence of the 14 arm chairs. M. Benedettlis mentioned as one of those secretaries. The 12peoida2zee Belge publishes the following letters:- "COPENHAGEN, Fis. 16. "At Copenhagentheresult of the elections of Deputies to the Supreme Council of the Monarchy has not been un. favourable to the Conser-ative party. MI Madvig, former Minister of Religious Affairs, having been named the Conservative party has succeeded in electing four of its candidates, whilst the ultra-Danish party was only able to 'return three. In Fionia, ho.ever, the triumph ofthelatter was complete, for the three deputies belonging to that province are classed among the ultra-Danes, although they do not profess exactly the same opinions. The result in Jutland is not yet known, but one of the Ministers now on his trial, ML Tillisch, having been elected by a pretty large majority, it may be inferred that the Con. servative party has recovered there considerable influene. As for the elections, in the Duchies of Sebleswig and Holstein they sufliciently indicate the spirit of antago. nism nad opposition prevailing in the country. The eiec. tiou in the same district of Mx Scheele and of MA Preusser, whose dismsssal from office constitutes one of the principal charges agaist the M1inister, must appear unaccountable to persons ignorant of thestrange mode of election established by the last law, and the still stranger perturbation in poli. tical ideas produced by the events of 1848. The trial of thc Ministers is drawing to a close. The sentence Wil pro. bably be delivered this day week. I am inclined to believe that the Court will confine itself to blame the conduct of the ex-Ministers, and will inflict no penalty. Winter has again set in with severity since some days. Snow covers all the roads; and the comannications are impeded. This incon. venience would have been obviated had the Copenhagen and Korsoer Railvay been opened last October as as intended. The Session of tho Diet of the Kingdom will shortly be elosed. It stil continues to evince a spirit of hosiflity to. wards the Government. which is highly detrimental to the administration of the country." "STOCHOLM, Fs. 12. "I consider it my duty to rectify the erroneous sser tios of several foreign journals, which have, stated that tho treaty, concluded on the 21st of November last, between the Western Powers and the United Kingdoms of Sweden andNorway,wastheresultoftheeifectproducedonour..Cabin by the capture of Sebastopol, and of the mission of General Canrobert to Stookholm. I have been asured by a persn eully credible and well informed, that the pourpa'7,, between the-King and the ministers of England ad hance repecting the bases of the alliance commenced as early as the first days of ThIy last, at the Pavilion of Haga, where their Majesties then resided. The journey of the King to Norway, the visit of Queen Victoria to Paris, and the im. portant events accomplished shortly afterwards in the Crimea, retarded the negotiations, without, however, inter rupting them, and it was ouly in antmn they wore brought to a close. This circumstance, for the correctness of which I can pledge myself, proveg in an incontea. tible manner that our Governmnent did not await th3 triumph of the allies in the Crimea, to manifest its sympathies, and enter tho Western Aliance. The position of the besieger was not very brilliant in the beginning of July, when wc received the account of the unsuccessful assault on the 18th of Juno, which cost the allies such severe losses. The NeCI Prus8ian Grtezc is consequently mistaken in asserting that General Canrobert was obliged to content himself with a defensive treatyrather than return to FrAnc without havingobtainedanyresult. Thebases of tho allianco were, ayou seo, already ageed upon and adoptoe even before the mission of the General was talked of, and his visit to Stockhohn had nothing to do with tho treaty."

A letter from St. Petersburg, of the 12th, in the Dbfats, says - " An Imporial ukase, addressed to the Senate, regnLates the position of certain assistants appointed under the Grand Dukes in the inspectionof the engineers and of tho artillery. Tho business of these officers will be to receivo tho reports from the chiefs of service, and to call the attention of the Grand Dukes to tho defects which may exist in the adaminis. tration, andinthe event of tho bsencee or illness of theGrand Dukes, theso deputies will replace them. ML Tchefkin, the present bead of the department of buildings and roads, has recently published different regulations intended to prevent certain abuses which formerly existed, one of which was that contractors who were about to make tenders were in. formed beforehand of the prieo that would bo accepted. According to accounts from Liban, only 23 vessels entered that port during 1855, and about the same number left The value of the imports was 32,0 silver roubles (4f. each), and that of the experts 140,000." A letter from St. Petersburg of the 12th, in the Censtiituioniel, says:- Prince Augustus of Wurtemberg,a member, by marriage, of the Imperial family, and who has just returned from a military mission to Berlin and lIanover, had a private audience of the Emperor yesterday, and expressed thegreat satisfaction felt bythe Courtof Prussia at the adhosionof Rus. siatothepropositionsofAustria. TheEmperoragainexpressed his desire to see peace concluded in the interest of the general tranquillity of the world, and in that of the ameliorations which ho has in contemplation for Russia. It is said that the Czar intends to completely reform the customs rbirnie, and to replace the present system, which is nearly prohibitive, by one framed with more liberal views. People who, pretend to be well-informed on those intended reforms say that foreign commerce wll hereafter dlnd all the frontiers open. They go even further, and affrm that the commer. cial treaty between Russia, France, and England is already drawn up, and will be signed immediately after the conclusion of peace and the Tecognition of Alexander IL by the Courts of Paris and London. At Odessa the mere hopes o, peace have completely transformed the appearauce o the place in a few days. 'Unfortunately the decision of the 10th January was not expected, and certain supplies ver n wanting to meet the sudden demand. Wheat and oats have obtained fabulous prices-the former is worth 24f. the hecto litre, and the hatter 20 paper ronbles. Flour also has not been found in sufficient quantity to meet the demand of purchasers, and the arrival of corn at this plae from the interior is anxioudy expected, although it is feared that the last harvest was not sufficiently productive to furnish as much as wil be required. A stiU greater rise in the prie of corn has taken place at Azoff. It is, however, hoped that a general faU wiU take place as soon as further supplies reach the diffe-ent markets. Great difficulty is still felt at Odessa in procuring cash and in getting bills discounted, and this difficulty wivl continue until the Bank is enabled to resume cash payments." A letter 'from St. Petersburg, in the Cclogaw Gazete, states that the fact of Count Orloff being sent to Paris is considered there not only as a manifestation of the Emperor's desire for peace, but likewise as a proof of lis wish to effect a oomplete reconciliation with France. A letter from Warsaw, of the 15th, states that all the civil authorities have been presented to the new Governor, General Gortschakoff. He made a speech to them on the occasion, in which he pa3sed a hig,h eulogium on the bravery displayed 'by the Polish officers and soldiers serving in the Crimea, but made no mention of any administrative reforms. The staff of the General will be composed of two offIcers of the staff of the Crimea charged with particular functions, and nine aides-de-camp. EETIC TELEGRAPHIC DPESPATES.

.THE ABMY Iz THE CRBIEA I (fmox ot owN O NDNT CAMP BEFORE SEBASTOPOITSn FE S. The quantity of powder used the other day in the explosion of Fort Nicholas waa 50,000 kilogmmmes, or 100,000 French pounds. Double that quantity was found under the fort when the engineem commenced their operations. This is not the only concealed store of powder the French have diAcovered in their part of Sebastopol. The firing which the Russians kept up for a short tirme previously to the explosion was drawn on by a French fatigue party getting wood from the houses in SebastopoL Some of the soldiers imprudently ahowedthemselveson the roofs,and the Rassian batteries opened. At the moment of the explosion an officer of rank in a green uniform, supposed to be the general commanding on the norx-h side, came out of the Star Fort, and apparently ordered his men off the parapet. He then stood looking on at the destruction of Fort Nicholas. The intention Was that all the Diines should explode simultaneously, and that they did not do so is attributable, as 1 am informed, to some fault in the fuse-Beckford's fuse, known among theFrench as le cordon Anglais. The effect, however, was very fine, and nothing could be more complete than the destruction. Fort Alexander is shortly to be blown up, and it is said the French Wi also destroy some of the principal buildings. Yesterday's English General Orders announces the completion of our share of the destuction of the docks Major Nicholson and Lieutenants {Grahaut and Gordon, who were immediately in charge of theze arduous works, and who took up their residence in the Rarabelnaia while they pro-ceeded, have returned to camp. There are still some small explosions going on in the vicinity of the docks, and there is talk of blowing up the revetment on the west side of the entrance, and perhaps also the barracks. At present they are blowing up houses, chiefly, as I believe, for the sake of experiment. Mr. Deane, best known here, as the "infernal diver," is not satisfied with the results obtained with his voltaic wires, which have failed in several instainces, and he is desirous to experimentahize in order to discover where the fault lies. The operations against the docks may be said to have commenced at the end of November, for, although a beginning was made at an earlier period, the works were quickly suspended, and resumed only at the above date. The French did their work in four explosions ; the English had six, besides minor ones of small extent. You are, perhaps, already aware -hat a number of the original plans, sectional and -others, used by the constructor of the docks, were found in Sebastopol, and have been of great use to the engineers in their work of demolition. These plans, now soiled and torn, are very neatly drawn and coloured. The night affair of which I spoke in a recent letter las never yet been completely explained. I am informed, however, by French officers who were in Sebastopol on the night in question, that two boats put off from their side with the intention of setting -fire to the last-remaiing Russian steamer moored at the entrance of Soukhaya Creek. They were provided with the requisite combustibles, cerdo&s irxedidires, &c.; but as they were pulling over they crossed seven Rusian boats, bound on no one knows what errand. The Russians did not meddle -with them, and of what ensued accounts differ, but -he steamer was not set on fire, and one of the French boats returned to shore with a hole through ter bottom and sank by the side of the quay. A man whose arm w taken off by the same shell that damaged the boat is since dead. The Mluscovite shot and shell fell thick into both the English and French parts of the town, and there were several marrow escapes, but little real damage. As to the tale of the Russians having intended to land, that appears to me absurd. They are doubtless wel aware of the strength of the garrisons of Sebastopol *and the Karabelnaia, and if they intended to try -anything it would hardly be with seven boatloads of men. To land without an instant alarm beinggiven -would be impossible, for the French sentries are at 10 paces from each other. I recently saw, by the bye, in an extract from a St. Petersburg paper, an account of a landing effected by a small party of Russians, who wandered about for some time, and before returning to their boats kIlled or severely wounded an English sentinel. The result of all the inquiries I have made is to induce me to think this story a mere fabrication, intended doubtless -to redound to the honour and glory of the attackfiug party. At any rate, I am positively assured that .no English sentry has been missed, or found killed or wounded at his post. - The half-yearly inspection which has been for some time going on will shortly be completed. Yesterday three regiments of the Fourth Division,-the 17th, 46th, and 57th,-were inspected by General Garrett, and all turned out in a most creditable manner. We have had several fine days lately, favourable to drills and parades, and advantage has been taken of them to exercise the men. The French, too, have been marching about -a good deal. The day before yesterday the Sardinian cavalry marched through the English camp, and over Picket-house Hill, where they went hrough a few manceuvres. The object in taking -them thither was, it is said, to show tnem Sebastopol, which many of them had never seen. There -were about 300 of them, dragoons and lancers. A finer day they could not have had for their promenade. There were an unusual number of persons 4ut towards the front that aftemoon, inconsequence of two reports that obtained currency. One of these -was that between I and 4 p.m. the French gunboat Alouette was to steam out of Streletska. bay, and attack Fort Constantine with a new sort of projectile, armed with a spike, which would stick in the wall and explode a few seconds afterwards. To ritness so novel and strange a sight as a tiny :`gunboat Ittackingsuch a huge mass of granite as Fort C6nstantine, and to witness the trial of the spiked shells, a great number of persons went forMard totheRedan and otherplaces,buttheyhad only their ride for theirpains.. -Theother report, later in tie afternoon, wu that -Day, the murderer of the artilleryman, was about -to be hung in the ravine in front of the Second Division, and numbers flocked to the spot, to find themselves hoaxed. The sen- tence of the - Court-martial on Day has not yet. appeared in orders, but it is pretty well known, owing to the Provost-Marshal having received direc. tions to prepare a drop. There was difficulty in finding a hangman, but a butcher of the- First Division haszcome forward-and offered his services. He is to receive 151., hs discharge, and apassage home to England. We hear that he refuses his dis_ charge, and wants only the :money, but it will _ probably not be deemed proper-to'retainhim in the - service after his performance of so odious a task It is reported that Day will be hung to-morrow morning in presence of thSdivision to which he-be. -longs -It is fortunate that onr merciful military authorites have- mustered resolution to let the lw take its course. The mistaken lenity with which gravo military offences-auch as attempted desertion,'groo insubordinati6n, foul language, and even blows to officers --have- been treated in this army is a subject of frequent comment ancd reprobation. We hBAe only to glAince over the General Orders-to fin a bundant examples of grave crimes lightly .isiite, Mien condemhed to death Shave in.ariably had their - sentences commuted. -Me 'Freach go upon. a- different system,w and ;19W littlc mercy to .the deserter or the mutineer, doubtless considering that an occasional severe example deters from crime; and is, in-fact;the most merciful mode of dealing with offences at all times unpardonable, but especially dangerous in front of the enemy. As an example of the mode in which we deal with them, I refer to General Orders of the 2d of February. A soldier threatens to shoot his sergeant, and is consequently the next day taken before nis colonel, to whom he whinea out, in a humble and supplicating tone, an entreaty for pardon. The colonel shakes his head ; the offence is too serious to be overlooked, and the plea of drunkenness put forward is no extenuation. " Then, take that r' says the rufian, with a sudden and complete change of manner, and violently hurls his cap at his commanding officer's head. Fifty lashes and 12 months' hard labour are deemed by a ceement Court-martial sufficient punishment for this gravest of military offences. At the end of December a sergeant of the -lth Hussars murdered a fellow-soldier at Kamiesch, and was sentenced to 14 years' transportation. General Codrington declared the Court to have taken a very lenient view of the case, and one in which he did not concur, but he nevertheless confirmed the sentence. The crime perpetrated by Day is of so heinous and cruel a description that a Courtmartial could hardly avoid passing, or a Commanderin-Chief refuse to confirm, the severest sentence of the law. The man murdered was sick in bed; he was intrusted to the care of the murderer, to whom he had just done a kindness. The case is clear, and the crime may be almost said to have been committed in the presence of the other orderlies, who rushed in at the shrieks of the victimto encounter a furious resistance. Yet therewas areport last night, that the culprit would get off in consequence of a flaw in the indictment. This is quite incredible, and would be too strong and glaring an example of the -traightforward simplibity of Courts-martal being nullified by the introduction of the quibbles of law. I enclose the proggramme of a series of educational lectures to be given in the Third Division. "3D DivisroN, BrriuTI ARMy, CA3n' nErous SE- BASTOPOL. "The library and zeading-hut of this division is now open for the use of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers, between the hours of U and 7 o'clock, when books can be taken out or exchanged, by application to the librarian in attendance, on soldiers giving their name, regiment, and company. Soldiers taling out books will be held responsible for them. " The following educational lectures have been announced, and which will be followed by others on each succeediag Wednesday evening (as long as practicable), commencing at 6 o'clock - -"On Wednesday, Feb. 6, 'The Pursuit of Knowledge IUnder Difficulties,' bythReev. B. Harris, LL.B., Officiating Chaplain. " On Wednesday, Feb. 13, 'Places of Interest in Old Testament History,'bythe Rev. H. Wheeler, B.A., Assistant-Officiating-Chaplain. "On Wednesday, Feb. 20, on 'Temperance,' by Sir James Alexander, Colonel of the 14th. "On Wednesday, Feb. 27, 'hMohammedanism,' by the Rev. Henry W. ML Egan, MA., Principal Chaplain." The first lecture was given, as announced, on the 6th inst., and was well attended. The audience consisted, with the exception of six or seven officers, entirely of the classes for which it was intendednamely, soldiers and non-commissioned officers. They 'were very attentive and well behaved. The reading-hut holds only about 100 persons, but a larger one is to be allotted to the purpose of lecturing. The mail, due yesterday, ha3 not yet arrived. It is most impatiently expected, as it wil bringa, dates four days later than the last, and, it is hoped, sometbing defnitive respecting peace or war. The newS, however, received by last post was generally of so pacific a complexion, and the rise in the funds was so considerable, that even the mostwilfully incredulous are fain to admit that the odds are in favour of peace. Those officers who are not satisfied -with the amount of promotion the war has given them grumble at and deplore the probable cessation of the great struggle; others, but I think the minority, whose ambition is content for the present with the grades they have obtained, are well pl4ased at the prospect of a return to "E England, ,home, and beauty." The latest " shave" is that Mlarshal Pelissier has got the armistice in his pocket, and means to keep it there until he has blown up a few more buildings in SebastopoL This is not very probable, but it will do for the Grenadiers' book. You are perhaps aware that the Grenadier Guards keep a " shave-book," inwhich are written down all the tales, yarns, and inventions that come to the ears of its contributors. I presmme that after the war they intend to publish it, with a dedication to that Blitish army in the East to whose fertile imagination they are chiefly indebted for its contents. A curious accident happened on Wednesday to a soldier of the 49th Regiment. He was passing through or near the Karabelnaia with a beam of wood on his shoulder, when a round shot struck the timber, and passed on without touching him. He was, of course, thrown violently to the ground, 'and the shock caused him to bite off a part of his tongue. He is now in hospitaL - Theweather since my last has continued fine,with moderate frost. The camp is dull and monotonous as usual. They have got private theatricalsin more than one division. Those inthe Fourth Divisionare still suspended, the new theatre, which is to hold 260 spectators, being not yet completedL AIthough the chase of the paper fox is not contingent on a "scent-lying morning," there have been no hunts of late, and the weary baggage ponies upon which sporting subs are seen following dog or paper have been allowed comparative repose. It is curious to behold the motley collection of animals that muster at these meets-stiiU more strange to. witness the manner in which they do their work. Competent judges are of opinion that there is no description of obstacle, short of a deep river or a made stone wall, which would suffice to stop a British infantry subalt on his Crimeanpony; and even in the cise of those, impednnents it is considered doubtful whether- he would not dismount and lift his, steed over the latter, or swin by_his side througlh the former.: As to loose stone walls and broad brooks, -he Iaughs at them. - If he. cannot leap the waillhe char;,es it and kockit down,-thus mnakirg apas-sage for hinuemf and followeri.

There is one singular contradiction in the constitution of the baggage ponies out heie. When wanted for a three hours' hard gallop over the country they are always found fresh and ready; but when required for public service, to fetch a light load half a mile from store'i to camp, it continually happens that they are lame, or have lost two shoes, or have got badly kicked in the night, or a re in such a pitiablestate of weakness that you could not powsibly get them out of the stable, unless you carried them in your arms. There is talk of forming a scientific commission to investigate and report upon these peculiarities of the. bht pony. The three Danish officers, two engineers and onei' Artilleryman, who arrived here at Christmas- visit Sebastopol and the ground which had been the: scene of so much hard fighting during the preceding 14 months, left the Crinea a day or two ago to re.turn to their own country, expressing themselves' highly interested by all that they had seen.

TURKEY. (FROM our. oww coCOEnPoNDENT.) CONSTANTIOPLE, FEB. IL The Ambassadors are still waiting for the offiial acceptance of their propositions with respect to the Fourth Point. In the meantime they have received copies of the firman which contains all the concessions urged by them in favour of the Mahomedans, subjects of the Porte, and which the Turkish Minis. ters hope to have sanctioned by the Sultan. Before, however, this can be done, these concessions must be submitted to and approved by the great Council in one public sitting at the least. It would be a great mistake to ap,ply our own ideas of despotic powerto Turkey or to any otherMahomedancountry, and to believe that, in theory, at any rate, the Sultan%s power is so unlimited that every one of his wishes is a command, andevery one of hiswords a law. In all Mahomedan countries the form of government may be called theocratic-that is, based on religion. This is especially the case in Turkey, where the Sultan is the head of the whole Mahomedan religion. This mixture of spiritual and temporal power, while giving, on the one hand, to the Sovereigns that unity of action which made them once so formidable to their neighbours, limits, on the other, their power in the interior to the observance of the traditional rules and usages laid down from the earliest times; and, strange to say, these rules and usages relate more to temporal than spiritual affairs. Az regards religious belief, Mahomedans are as free, if not freer, than the followers of any religion; every man is left to himself to search after truth, and toleration of dogmas is carried so far that the late Sheikh-ul-Islam, by whose cooperations Mdahmoud carried out his reforms, was well-known to disbelieve in the Koran, and yet he remained up to his death in his place without ever being molested. In the same way, there is nothing in the Nahomedan religion which can be called priesthood. Every man may read prayers publicly, and preach. The Ulemas are only doctors of the Mlahomedan law, inherited by the Turks from the early Arab Caliphs, which it is their duty to explainp and over the observances of which they have to watch. This law is composed of the decisions of 'he most prominent Mahomedan doctors of all ages on every matter connected with the external religious observances, with civil and criminal jurisprudence, and the public law of the State, but it has nothing whatever to do with dogmas. It is thus rather what, in other countries, is called the fundamental law of the State than a religious code. One must well understand this position to be able to judge of the nature of the influence which the Ulemas exercise. They have a kind of control over the power of the Sovereign. This control has been recognized at all times, and, whenever the Sultans have taken important decisions, the Sheikh-ulIslam, as the elected head of the expounders of the Mahomedan law, on which the organization of the State is founded, has been always asked to investigate and decide whether the measure proposed is not unlawfuL The decision consists in one single word affixed to the project, which is " Tais" -that is, " allowed." But in more important decisions the Fetva, or decision of the Sheikh-ul-Islam, is not thought sufficient ; the project must be submitted in a public sitting to a general council, at which every one may attend and make his observations. This is carried so far that even questions the decision of which ,belongs in other countries exclusively to the Go' vernment-for instance, the right of peace and war-are submitted to the scrutiny of such publc a3semblies. An example of this occurred at the beginning of this very war. When the Government had decided that the war with Russia was inevitable, three such public councils were held, with the interval of a week between each of them. In a question of such importauce as the enunciation of the principle of perfect equality between aU subjects, one or more of these assemblies cannot be lawfu.llydispensedwith,butunfortunately such seems to be the intention of the Cabinet. They try to get -the firman signed by the Sultan without any such preliminary public council, for all the councils held :hithero have been secret and only attended by membersnamedby theGovernment. In consequence of this, considerable fermentation exists among the Mahomedans inConstantinople. The Ministry is pledged to the representatives of the alled Powers to have the measuer carried, and they fear not to be able to -do so, and to lose their places should they bring -on a public discussion on such a point. This isthe cause of the delay in this matter. It is impossible to say what will be the result-whether the Sultan will consent to sign the firman without its being submitted to a publc sitting of the Council, or whether the'-M*inistry, unable to realize its promises, will have to resign; or, lastly, whether it Will decide to proceed lawfully in this :question. -.An opinion. about this is even more difficult, as there is a division in the Cabinet. itself, - the Grand Vizier, Aali Psa, and kveral others being averse to violate what they consider to be the law, while Fuad Pasha and 31ah. mnud Rushdi Pasha seem not to be troubled by these-scruples. BNut the Grand Vizier embarks to-morrow on board the' Ajaccio for Marseilles, and so the question now is which side his Kaimakan, Melimid Kibrisi Pasia,- will take on this subject; Thus the matter rests. The conferences about thlo fowth pOit a-re teminatee but the questionis *till pending. In the meantime, as it seems desirable to come likewiselto a preliminary arrange. ment iu respinf-tto they futuie position of the PrimWipslfties ibef6re the fiual conferences should begin in Paris, the-conferences ont tteipintccommenced ,on lida-ligT& 8th inst. and have been since Lthat day-held every aftern9on at the French palace. -.Unlike the conferences about the, fourth point, -thii time the Trildsh minliters come forward thexl- 'selves stlha a:proPoibl~forE regulation of thoPribL- ipaiities; i-The leading idea in' these propossisto ?ip h l ian and stipulations between the Porte, and Moldavia and Wallachia as the bse of Ureir'.political, position. Asregardi the election of the- princes,. it is -proposed to - let the native assemblies elect three candidates, out of whom the Port_ fs to name a 'prince for life. In order to naderstad what these_bases proposed for the fature regulation of the Principalities, I imust say something about the tiulations. In point of time the submision of the two Pincipalities- to Turkey goes back for many years, that of Wallachia having taken place in 1392, under Sultan Bajazet Ilderim, while that-of Moldavia took plac in 1513 under Selim. In the first case the submission was-compulsory; in the second it was voluntary. The Hatti-Scheriff given by Sultan B3ajazet I. to the Wallachians is as follows:- . 2 "Art, L Actuated by our great clemency, we consent that the principality newly acquired by our inanibible power shall governi itself according to its own laws, a<d tlEt ,the Prince of Wallchis shall have the right to make peace or war, and of life and death over his subjects. " Art 2. No Christians, who having embraced the Mahomedan religion, may pasw-from the countries subjected to our power into Wallachia, and may become again Christians, shall be reclaimed, orinanyway molested. " Art. 3. All Wallachians who may emigrate into any other pirt of our dominion shall be exempt from tho Eharadj inad all other taxes. " Ar. 4 The Christian princes wi be elected by the metropolitan and the boyards. | Art. 5. For this our clemency and because we have placed this rayah prince among the number of our other subjects, be will have to pay to our treasury every year the sum of 3,000 gold piasters of the country, or 500 silver plasters of our money. " Given at Nicopolis in the month of Heb ul nmri of the year 795, or 1392-3." This finman, as well as a subsequent convention of the year 1460, forms the basis of the connexion between Wallachia and the Turkish empire. - This convention confirms and explains all the rights given to Wallachia in the former, and the only alteration is that the tribute is fixed at 10,o00 piasters yearly. Both these documents are existing in Wallachia, and were printed. The original convention given to the Moldavians has been burnt, but it is probable that another copy exists in the archives at Constantinople. It is, however, Imown that this convention is very similar to that with Wallachia, or, if anything, it is rather more favourable. The fact is mentioned, that Moldavia submitted to the Ottoman empire from her free wil and without any coercion, and that, in consideration of this, all churohes and religious rites shall be inviolable, and that the laws shall be maintained in their full force. The tribute of 4,000 gold pieces, 40 horses and 24 falcons, was only mentioned under the name of presents. The election of the princes by their countrymen was not only recognized, but all other prerogatives which Wallachia enjoyed were inserted. It was in 1583 that Soliman converted the donation into a regular tribute. . The great principles recognized by these conventions are that of autocracy in the internal administration of the two Principalities, and the right of supremacy of the Porte. This is not at all impaired by the right conceded to the Princes of Moldavia and Wallachia to declare peace or war, for all the governors of the frontier provinces had it mentioned in their firmans until the new reformers divided the civil and military power. The proposal of the Turkish Ministers to place the Principalities in the position stipulated in their original convention with the Turkish empire met in a great measure the views of the ambassadors,.so that every hope may be entertained of this question being settled to the satisfaction of all parties. If I say all parties, I include the people of the Principalities themselves. All the moro disinterested part of it, that is all those who are not compromised with Russia or Austria, will form an intimate connexion with Turkey, provided their independence in internal affairs be guaranteed. -i A rather more doubtful question iq, whether the proposal of the Turkish Ministry about the election of the Princes of Moldavia and Wallachia, will be viewed with so much favour by al parties. It is in direct contradiction to the terms of the conventions, which are nevertheless assumed as the bases for the regulation of the Principalities. According to these the right of nominating the Princes belongs to the Metropolitan and the Boyards, and this system was adhered to as long as these conventions were respected. Al the Princes in both countries were elected in this way up to the beginning of the last century.- The change which occurred then was the work of Russia, and it was by the abolition of the elective system and the nomination of the Fanariote Princes thatRussiafirst established her influence in the Principalities. The Fanariote Princes, who bought their places from the ruling power at Constantinople, the Janissaries looked at their office only as a means of enriching themselves, and thus maklng up for the heavy bribes which they had had to pay for their places. When the power of the Janissaries was broken by Mahmoud, ho re-established the election of the princes, retaining, only the right of confirming them.- The nomination of the princes by the Porte out of three candidates would only bring back the same results which the nomination of the Fanariote Princes by the Janissaries hadnamely, the place would be sold to the highest .bidder, and some Turkish officials would make a handsome thing of it. To-day is the fourth and last conference on this subject. Galata is still in a state of excitement and confusion about the continued faU of the rate of exchange. All things have sunk in price and all those who have heavy stocks expect heavy losses. However disagreeable these consequences may be for the moment to all those who lose by them, it must have a good effect on the market in the end, by bringing down prices and wresting the exchange from the hands of the few for the benefit of alL The following is a nominal list of deaths in the Hospitals at Scutari from the 5th to the 9th of February Sergeant Charles Doyle, 97th Regiment, apoplexy; Corporal GeorgeNewbury, 4th Light Dagoons, strictura ur.; Privates John Sykes, 5th Ennisallen Dragoons, dysentery; Timothy Donovan, 6th Dragoon Guards, not known; Jan Wesoloski, PolishLegion, febris int. - Number of Burials at Scutari during the past week.- Feb. 3d, 1; 5th, 1; 6th, 1; 8th, 1; 9th, L Number of Sick and Wounded in the Hospitals at Scutari :on the morning of the - of February.-Officers, 49 sick non-commissoned officers, drummers, and privates, 1,0)5 sick, 7 wounded; General Hospital, 314 sick, 2 wounded; Barrack Hospital, 418 sick, 5 wounded; Kululee Hospital, 283 sick.

RBUSSIA. - (PRliotiE OI ER -OORoqmwr I . z ~ ' ' E . 'BERLI, F,Ip. -in a recent letter oL the subject of Ruaia I pointed out with what avidity the public press in that country, of which we know that it, at least, cannot express views at varianee with those of' tho Government, isnow.tuniingto the subjectof railroads and improved communications in the interior. 'ot only do those organs of the press that devote themselves more particularly.to agricultural interests and political economy, but also simply political journals, lay the greatest stress upon the neces; sity of opening up the resources of the country, with reference to a state either of peace or vwar. They say very distinctly to their readers:-" The disadvantagesof adeficiency-inmeansof communication have never shown themselves amore strikingly than in this war, sud wFhther this'war be'eontinued novr 'or its'further proseeution be deferred till more ' uspicbous times, attention must be directed, first and fore-MOSt, to this poiut." The-Emperor is doing all that li& in his power to assist the newly-appointed Director or" Roads, Communications, and Public Works, Tschewvtin, in the zealous execution of his duties, which seem to havo been very sluggislyfulfilled by his predecesso:% Count Kleinmnichel; he has permitted him to ap'lY to the purpose of his office the surplus receipij,i --f tolls and turnpikes, A&., and other ways ana ,.means, vithout first going through all the routine OI paying them in, getting his accounts audited, submitting plans, and procuring approbation after a gre, t loss' ef time. He has nlbe put at his disposal sums of money . to be applied as special douceurs for the encouiilgemehit of unusual zeal among his officials and underlings. Towards this samne end also the .Minister of the Interior, Lanskoi, is using his influence anid authority towards the nobility and large landholders, for their co-operation with the vaaions local authorities is' of the greatest importane, seeing that from them the greatest sacrifices urerequired in the way of land, and the labeur of their peasants for thke con struction.of -oads. As it will be. chiefly from England that the materials, the skill, and the labour for the future railroads in Russia will be sought in the event of a peace being now patched up in Pari, our press cannot choose a more useful or patriotic task than striving to prevent English capitaland skill being abstracted from England for the benefit of Russia: the soonertherequiredrailroadsarefinised, the sooner Russia will plunge us in war again. As the subject of the repeal of serfdom in Russia, has of late been brought before the notice of the public, and Europe led to look forward to its speedy realization, it will be useful to examine the terms of the most recent uk-ase on the subject, and which has for its object " the manumission of serfs throughout the empire." 1. Landed proprietors who propose to themselves to bestow freedom on their serfs according to the manner of the Crown peasants, who are settled on their owfn freehold, are to lay before the chef of the government in which they live the draught of the agreement between themn. 2. 'When the chef has received the draught he invites the marshal of the nobility of the go-. vernanent and the director of the domains-office to a conference, and if they agree that the obligations imposed on the peasant by the agreement do not overtax his strength, and are, in fact, feasi-- ble, the draught is returned to the owner of theserf, and signed by both persons, and also by the marshal of the circle and the l'bpranxA. The agreement is then forwarded again to the chef of the government, accompanied by a petition, addressed direct to the Emperor, praying that the agreement may be confirmed. Then follow three clauses, providing for the cases in which the above-mentionedGovernment officers do not coincide in their views; in that case the -draught is returned to the serf-owner, for the purpose of being altered and consented to by the serf, and is in some cases to be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior, whi-ch, in conjunction with the domains! office, arranges the matter. The chief importance of this enactment is that it brings these various agreements between owner and serf forthe commutation of the servitude under the control and check of the higher State officers; the marshal of the nobility and the local authorities are only too apt to favour the interest of the owner; the serf's chief protection remains still his own shrewdness in the arran.ement of the bargain, but he nevertheless gains, inaddition to the negative protection of examination of the agreement by the local authorities, the positive protection involved in the confirmationby the Emperor, which is always preceded by a strict independent investigation into the circumstances. Since the issue of this ukase there has been no enactment on the sabject of " abolition" of serfdom. As we are indebted to the French press for the pleasing dreams raised by the prospect of so many millions being raised to a state of freedom, it may be worth while to quote a Russian paper of the 18th ult., inveighing against the French jouralists for their fabrication of Russian news. It reprehends them as "Nothing but- lies, lies, and once more lies. Neither the Constitutionn2l, nor the Patri-, nor the Prcssc ever have a syllable written to them direct from St. Petersbur. These got-up articles originati, all and every one, in their editors' offices, or in Berlin. It is revolting that the. press of a nation which is reckoned among the highest civilized should dupe the credulity of the public in such an impudent and brazen manner. Of late it laa been the Constitaionnd2 and the Prcsse that have had the impudence to quote words that are pretended to be Russ, but which have nothing like Russian about them, for the manufacturer of them knows nothing of Russ or Russia." The Northerm Bee is now just as outrageous in its peace articles as it lately was in blowing the war trumpet; it tolls us that the expectation of a peace being concluded, of which there can now be no doubt, and consequently the hoyes of an unimpeded navigation, have raised the prices of Russian goods andloweredthose of foreigawares. The letter from which the following is an extract comes from an authentic source in the Polish capital:- stl - "It is now a setilthingthatas soon as the fine weather comes the Emperor Alexander will come to Warsaw, which he has not seen for years, and he wil bring an e sive amnesty with him. When he is there he will, as is stated for certain, lay the foundation stone of a monument to be erected to the memory of the lately deceased Field-Maanhal Paskiewitsch, and thus commemorate the merits of the most faithful serrant hislate father ever had. What changes besides the Empeor may intend to make in and with, Poland are either not yet settled or s well-lept secret. The only thing that I hare been able to learn that I can depend upon is that the kingdom of Poland is to have a combined Xinistry of its own (Interior, Fmanoe, and Publicinstraction), and to the different posts in which more especially natives of rank and of well-known loyal sentimenta wi be nominated. On Feb. 1, the same day that the news of the death of Prince Pasliewitsech reached St. Petersburg, the Emperor appointed Prince Michael GortaIcaoff, formerly illitary Governor of- Poland, subsequently Commander-i-Chief of the Army of Ocen , ana afterwards Generalissimo of' the Souther Army and the troops inthe Crimea,to be Stadtholder of Poland and Generalissimo of the West and Central Armies. (The first of these is, commanded by General Sumaarakoff the latter by General Paniutia.) On the 14th inst. the new Stadtholder received the high military and civil dignitaries of the kingdom, together with the nobility and dlergy, in the apartments ofef the palace. 'When all were assembled the }rince expreswed to them his satisfaction that it had pleased lis Mjesty the Emperor, his august nmaster, to honour him with this publie mark of his confidence, and in consequence of which he now found himself again in the samne post that he had on n former ocasion only provisionally occupied. He informed them further that the Poleswhoe had been serving umder him in the South and Crimean armieshad fought very bravely, and that many of them must be reckoned among the bravest and most valued officers of the Emperor's army. In conclusion, lie expressed his confidence that lis Majesty the Emperor would have every cause to be satisfied with the zeal and entireevotion 'with whichS his (the Emperor's) service was performed. :When the reception was over' the Prince, accompanied by all the'guests present, repaired to the church, where divine service wras performed. A species of offiieusx announcement is made by the Kreez Zcitung of this place to the effect that, in Case a peace should he broughit about, al- tho military rcserres in Ruiaz& will not be sent to their homes at once, but a portion of them be kept back for the construction of railway earthworks and telegraphs on a large scale. In all probability the last lo which has not yet - been' expenfed, would bo taken for this purpose, There are also to be great facilities offered to *ussian commerce with the rest of the world-in short, if only half of what thfese Russian papers talk of bo fulfilled, we are about to enter upon a commercial miennium. Of course, where there'sre such bright lights in a picture there must be proportionally deep shades; thus, for instance, the billeting board of Abo- informs the inhabitants that from Aprll.2Tth.toNovember 13th of this year the military-force that will be quartered on .them will be three times as great as it has been at any time since the commencement of the war. It is evident from this that, howvever confident Russia is of maldngpeace with nceandAustria,she is net so su re of coming to terms witb England." (Advertisement.]-," Sb.

TRADE REPOBT. Thursday Evening. SoGAn-The public sales to-day have gone off with spirit, taken chiefly for export and a part speculatively, of whicih the following are the particulars :-%034 bat grainy Madras, good bright yeUow, 42s. zo 42s. L 4 boxec Havamnai, damaged yelow, of indirect importation, 35s. to 44s. 6d. ; 475 cases, 324 bags, and 190 barrels Bahis, low to middling brown, 32s. to 34S.

TrF.-The series of sales which commenced to-day com. prised 24,047 packages, of which 12,400 packages were congon, 2,500souchong, 2,900 scented orange pekoe, 1,100 scented caper, 560 hyson, 600 young hyson, 1,900 gunEo wder, and the remainder assorted About 13,700 packages have psssed the hamner to-day, but there wa3s so little dis positlon to purchase t-hat only about 1,400 packages were realized. The fewi gunpowiders which were offered sold at full prices, but the quotations of almost every other kind were w-ith difficulty supported The sales will be resumed to-morrowv. CoEma-There was only one sale of 56 casks, 120 barrels aand bags plantation, and 1,328 bags native Ceylon which were chiefly withdrawn-the latter at 52s. per cwt. icaE.-Of 2,200 bags Bengal brought forward about twothirds sold cheaply at 10s. 6d. for low middling heated. LnDIGo.-The sales of indigo, which commenced on Tuesday, the 12th inst., terminated to-day. The qantity origmalUydeclared was 9,013 chests-viz, 6,383 cests in catalogue A, which consisted of the foUowing assortment *- 3,065 chests Bengal, Benares, &o. ; 879 chests MEdras; 1,201 chests Kurpah; 1,161 chests Oude and plant Oude; 38 chests Manmla- 39 chests fig-making a total of 6,383 chests, and 2,6i0 chests sundries in catalogue B, of which about 1,000 chests were Madras and Kurpab, constituting altogether 9,013 chests; of these1,342 chests have been withdrawn, leaving 7,671 chests put up. During the interval which elapsed between the October sales and those just conduded (say Messrs. Dipnall and Co. in their circular) several circumstances concurred to produce the advance in the value of indigo, which then too&- place. The continuaUv decreasing estimate of the Bengal crop and the short out-turn from Madras, in combination with the large deliveries, both forhome use and export, gave a strong tone to the market, and a considerable amount of business was done, partly on speculation, prices in the meanwhile gradualy advancing tUl the eve of the sale from 2d. to 8d. per lb. above the October rates. The sales therefore opened withsome deree of briskness, at an advance on as de. sriptions of Bengalof 9d. to Is., and on Kurpah iMadras Gd. to Is. perlb., the good coloured and desirable known marks realizing the most money and occasionally exceeding Is. advance. This animation continued until towards the last dayortwo,when the catalogue comprised chiefly Madras, and indigo from former sales and in second hands, and some irregularity in price, with a slackness of demand, watsobservable, particu'lryin qualities above 7s., which sold from 6d. to -d.advauce*; but, on the whole, the currency of the earlier part of the sale was otherwise pretty well maintained. Dry-leaf Madras met but apartial demand, chiefly in the lower-priced sorls, and sold from October rates to 3d. per lb. dearer. On the whole, fully as much indigo has been sold as was expected-viz., 4,856 chests in the room, and about 350 chests out of the withdrawn and bought in. The home trade are considered to have taken about 2,000 chests; exporters, 2,600 chests ; and dealers and others, 500 chests. There has been a good attendance of buyers irom the country during the sale, but only a limited one from the continent.

In this case the defendant was proceeding to execution upon certain judgmients entered up against the plaintiff who had filed this bill to restrain guch execution. When the case came on it apreared that an objection was taken by the answer that the plaintiff was an- -otlaw under three several writs, and was therefore incapaclitated frm sui rg and the evidence of that was a ceriied-copy of the writ of egifacias. '3x. F Wlhiteaad Mr. Huddleston (of the common law bar) apueared for the defendant. Mr. ' vAsss and Mr. WALEY, forthe plaintiff, contended that an oultlawry could not he set up by the anser, hat must be pleaded, and, moreover, the certiHied copy of the writ of egi fac was not sucident, but theremust bea copy of the writ of capias u~lagatum. The VscECILÃ¯Â¿Â½YCzr.rM now said that it appetared to himi that even where the plaintiff was seeldng to recover some thing the defendant could not plead outlawry against him; nor m that case, under the 14th section of the 14th an 15th Victoria, c. 99, was it necessary to have more than the certified copy of the writ of ezcgifacias and the prooeedingsof the sheriffs. The effect of the outlawry was to transfer to the Crown the goods and chattels of the plaintifl; but be was not, in fact, suing, hut seeking to protect himself against iahilitieeawas still under, and which this suit sought to relieve him from.

COURT OF QUE1N'S BENCH. GumLDTA FEB. 21. SIEVEXING V. MAAS. (SiWing7 at WVti Pr1us. before Lord CAMPBE1I.1 - Mr. Mnowles, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty appeared for the laintifi; and Mr. Bovill and Mr. Honymnan for the de.eu.dant. This was a trial by the judge without the assistance of'a At the conclusion of the trial yesterday Lord Camnmsid he would take time to consider his decision, aId give it this morning at the sitting of the Court. The plaintiffs7, Messrs. Sieveking, were merchants engaged in the Baltic trade, and carrying on business in Fenchurchstreet. The defendant was master and part owner of a ship named the Minerva, belonging to some foreign port. The action was brought against the defendant to recover damages for the breach of a contract of charterparty, whereby the plaintiffs chartered the sai p Minerva to bring home a cargo of timber and deals from land, in the Gulf of Bothnia, to one of several ports in England, according to orders to be given to the master either at the port of loading, or of Elsinore downwards-c.,on its way to England. Theplaintiffs omitted to give any orders, and the master in consequence took the cargo to Leith, where it was uncaleable. By the charterparty, which was dated London, the 15th of September, 1855, the defendants were bound " to proceed to a coal portk or a good and safe port on the Firth of Forth, or to London, or to a good and safe port on the east coast of Great Britain, as ordered on sign.mgbills of lading, or with Lundwall and Fock, at Elsinore, downwards," &L. The freighter was to be allowed 14 running days for loading the ship, if not sooner despatched, and the ship was to be discharged in 14 days after arrivaL The freighter was also to have the option of keeping the ship 10 days on demurrage over and above the said laying days, at 5t. per day. The bill of lading was dated October the 20th, and was received in London by the plaintiffs on the 2d of November, and informed them that at the date of the bill of lading the MIinerva was riding at anchor in the harbour of Nyland, "bound for orders at Elsinore." T he plaintiffs, howrever, gave no orders for several days. It appeared that - the ship arrived at Elaine-a n SRda evenine the 3d- of November, and nxeitmonn,Dm a c,uiamly, way znn., A. on^ . and made nquiry at Lundwall and PFOCk'S. He then foundthatnoordershadbeenHreceived. e made further inquiries of other merchants at Elsinore, but, still finding that no orders bad been received, he sailed the next morning, and took the cargo to Leith. Under these circumstances, the question arose whether the defendant was justified in sailng as he had done, or whether he ought not to have remained longer at Elsinore, and telegraphed to England for orders. In the course of the trial it was stated that Sunday was a day of business at Elsinore. Lord CAIPBELL upon this observed that, as Elsinore was in a Christian country, the contrary must be assumed. Evidence was then given to show that at Elsinore mercliants regularly attended at their offices on Sunday. The witness stated that when at Elsinore he had no difficulty in seeing at their offices six or seven merchants whom he was desirous of seeing. Mr. K;OwvEs contended that upon the evidence the plaintiffs were entitled to the verdict The defendant ought to have waited a reasonable time at Elsinore and telebraphed to England for orders. If he had waited he minght thus have received orders in the course of a few hours on the Monday. Mr. BovLL contended that the plainti4 as soon as they received the bill of lading on the 2d of November, ought to have sent their orders; and, not having done so, the defen. dant was justified in leaving as he had done, having waited a reasonable tine. Lord CA'IPBEIL now said,-At the conclusion of the bearing of this case yesterday I entertained an opinion in favour of the defendant, and now, having taken time to consider, and having deliberated, my opinion is confirmed. The question is whether the defendant remained a reasonable time at E,lsinore for orders, and my opinion is that he did so. The loss sustained is to be ascribed to the negligence, and I wil say the gross negligence, of the plaintif They might have known by the charterparty that the defendant might have to call at Elsinore for orders. It appeared also by the evidence that they received the bill of lading onFriday, the 2d of November. Bnt they gave no orders on the 2d, nor on the 3d, nor on the 4th of tat month. They entirely neglected their duty in not giving orders. Tne defendant arrived at Elsinore on Saturday, Nov. 3, and on Sunday, according to the custom, he inquired whether orders had been sent. He not only applied to the plaintiffs? agents, but he went round to all the merehants at Elsinore, and found that there were no orders there. On the Monday moniing he sailed off, as he was properly justified in doing. He 3id al that was required of and the loss arose entirely from the regligence of the plaintiffs. The defendant was not bound to remain all the remrning laying days, or all the demuxrrage days; but, having remained areasonable time, and finding no orders, be was justified in sailing. lamn not called upzon to give any opinion about the telegraph, for the second plea is demurred to; but, if my oplAion on that point were invited, my opin;on wouldbe that the defendant was not hound to telegraphi. According to the case cited from the 4th Campbell, anwhich has been since acted on, it appears to me that no a w c pen thedefedanttocommunicate vith the plaintiffs when he arrived at El1sinore;* but it was the duty of the ylaintiffe actively to interfere, and to send orders- Myopimon therefore is that a verdict ought to be entered for the defendant. 31r. KOWLr.ES aplied to have the question reserved for the opinion of the Court. Lord CAMEPBELL said he had not the smaUest doubt about it, and refused the application. DRESSER V. EINSS. 31r. J. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Maynard appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Wonyman for the refendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover the sum of 585., being the value of 5,000 railway sleepers, of certain shapes, dimensions, and qualities, sold and delivered to the defendant. The only point of interest in the case was that since the Common Law Procedure Acts of 1852 and 1854 it is still possible for a record to contain seven counts in the declaration and 16 pleas, with a suitable number of replications, to which may now be added, as in the present case, two or three demurrers by way of decoration. Mfr. lfAYNARD, as the junior counsel for the plaintiff. opened the pleadings to the jury. The leaned gentleman went through the operation with great calmness and apparent gusto. When he arrived at somewhere about the 13th plea the gentlemen of the jury began to stare with, looks of bewilderment'at the labyrinth into which they were being drawn. At length Lord CAMPEims could no longer refrain from expressin in strong terms his disapprobation, and asked Mr. Maynard to be good enough to let the Court and the jury know what the question was they were about to try. Mr. MYxvAD said he could but ofen the leadings. Mr. HornrAxs, thejunior counsel or the efendaut,upon whom the greater share of blame seemed to rest, then rose, - in the absence of his leader, and said that the counts of the declaration had been'drawn by a barrister who was nowt jdge (laughter), and the pleas had been settled by anothet brister who was now also a judge (laughter), and that both the learnedjudges had been members of " the Commission for-ReformingtthedConimonLaw." (Laughter.) l l Lord Cnxpns said he thought reformers ought toreform themselves. (Iaughter.) The trial then proceeded, but afterall this pleading, the object of which is daclatedto be "to ascertain thetAubject for decision," the parties were for some time unable to say what the real question at isse wa At length this was ascertained, andlunad by the jury in favour of the defendant, subject to a reference as to the amnount to be deducted from the plaintiff's claim, the verdlct ~Itimate to be for the plaintiff for the balance, if any.

COURT OF EXCHEDUXL TEi. 2L mEEwEATmdC V. ROY AEND AiOTmER. (Sitings at N"APriu, bP&/ ,f 1l2ac fl ^lA;zls an> a Mr. IIL Chambers and Ilr. ilanisty were counsel for the plaintiff ;- Mr. Serjeant Shea and Mr. Hawkins were counsel for the defendants. The plaintiff is a young lady, atd this vas an action in which she sought to recover compensation from the defendants, who case the well-known and highly-respectable firm of Roy and Roy, solicitors to the london and Westminster Bank, for certain alleged negligence in the discharge of their duty to her as their client, whereby they had consented to a *udgmnent being sined againsb ber, and a " stop order" on her property to the extent of 1,553M, whereas they haa Oly authority to consent to such ~judgment being signed to the extent of 9561., or thereabouts. The substantial derfence raised by the pleas was a denial of the alleged uisconduct. It appeared that the plaintiff'sfamnily have IonC indulged in the luxury of liiation, and that in S52 or 1853 there were in existence no leas than five suits. Of these two were family Chancery suits, to wlich the plaintiff her sister, and two brothers were arties. The other three were confined to the brothers. these roceedings hadbeen carried on by;the farail solicitors, Messrs. Raw and Gurney, till their bill forcst in the first two amounted to 95., and to 6OO. and upwards in the last three. The attorneys beinganxious to obtain payment, an arrangenient was made for the transfer of the suite to the defendants, and eventually an actionwas brought against all theparties con cerned forthe total amount of costs.. Whenthat action was ripe for trials negotiation was oDpened by Mesart. Rawand Gurney with their formercients, the brothers of theolaintiff whobadgenerallyacted for the family at largein conjunction with their father, which ended in an agreement by which one-third of their bill of costs was to be paid down, and the residue secured by two equal bils at six and 12 montl to be signed by the family. To this the plaintif mi ba taken to have been a consenting party, burt it wasnot cajried out, for, instead of it, the consent'now complained of 'was given by Messrs. Roy's managing clerk, at the instanceof one of the plaintif's brothers, who stated that he had faull authority from the family to warrant that gentleman in signing the consent on behalf of all parties. The effect of this proceeding wasthat the plaintiff was rendered liable for the costs in the proceedings to which she was not a party, as well as to her own proper costs. It did not a r however, that her funds had been attached to a greater extent than that to which she was liable, and at was explained by Mr. Roy on his oath that the proceedingcomplainedof appearedtohirnto,bewell calculated to serve the yo ladyasbest interests, as, if somearneement had not been come to, Itaw and Gurney could, and would, have sent down an execution against her for all her admitted liability at once, and the arrangement thus adopted charged all the family funds with all the costs, and admitted of their raising a sum of money to pay off these and other matters-a step which was taken by the plaintiff; in conjunction with her brothers and sister, through the instrumentalityof the defendants. Under these circumstances, which are but a meagre outline of a very long and dull cause, the defendauts contended that they were justified in acting as they had done on the authority of the brother, as the agent of the plaintiff, and that she had by her sabsequent conduct ratified that direction, of whica she perhaps was not cognizant at the time. The jury interrupted the cause at the end of the defendant's case, and were anxious to return their verdict -for them, butthe learned counse for the plaintiff claimed his righlt to reply, and certainly exercised it with great zeal audpower, batwithout effect,for, after a few observations from the Cam]? Baxosx, who said he approved their verdict, the jury adhered to their originail hiew, and at once returned a verdict for the defendant.
ADAMIALTY COURT. THInRnxv. ViY 21; THE 31OBILE-COLLSION. (Before Dr. LuSmmGTON.) This was a suit promoted by the Sanish brig Fenix, of the burden of 290 tons, against the Mobie, of tho burden of 1,040 tons, to recver the losm arising from a collision between them at 12 30 p.m. on the 19th of August last in the Gull Stream. The brig was proceeding from London to Cardiff, in ballast; the Mobile was bound from Cananore en mtu 't of Malabar* to London, with troops on b'oard According to the representation of tho brig, when about rnidway between the Middle BraLe and South Brake buoys, heading S.S.E. on the 'starboard tack, she descried the Mobile to the southwaard, distant about amile, rauing to the northward. There was a brig to the northward; on the Mobile's starboard bow, and a schooner a short distance to the windward of the Fenix, also on the starboard tack-. The Fenix, under the direction of a pilot, held on her reach so as to round the Brake buoy and go into the Downs, expecting that the Mobile would alter her course, and pass under the stern of the Fenix, instead of which she attempted to go ahead, and in so doing ran into her on the starboard side, and cut her down to the copper. The Mobile, in her defence, alleged that, having taken a pilot on board at Dungeness, the master, who had been on deck the whole of the two preceding nights, gave up the charge to him, and' went bow. The pilot left the deck, and directed the second mate to steer the MIobile north-east by north, in which direction she would have passed clear astern of the schooner and the Fenix, had they kept their respective courses.' The schooner, instead of so doing, when she had approached the Mobile to within about 300 yards, suddenly hove in stays togo aboutontheporttack. Thepilot afteranabsenceof five minutes, retunmed on deck, and, finding that the schooner had stayed on the Miobile's port bow, hailed the brig on her starboard side to port her helm, nnd at the same time, ordered thehelm of the Mobile to be also ported. The order was instantly obeyed, and both vessels paid off rapidly. The Xenix continuing to keep her reach, was hailed to put her helm down and go about, the Mobile, fro the then position of the schooner, being unable to p under the ster, of the Xenx. The heahe, however, kept on her course, and ran into the M Iobile. Dr. TeISS absd Dr. thrpEs were heard for the Xenisx; Dr. Anots and Dr. ROmINSON forthe Mfobile. or The learned Jwasoe inquired of the ElIder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, first, whether by the want of skill or promptitude of action on the part of the mate of the Mobile duLring the absence of the pilot from theo deck the vessels were not brought into imminent 'danger of collision, or whether he was entirely exzcused by the schooner suddenly throwing herself into stays; secondly, whether the pilot was to blame or not at the last moment in ordering the helm to be ported; thirdly, whether the Xenix was to blame for having kept on her course, she being on the starboard tack, close hauled. The Ennxn!aL Bstsrnxxx were of opinion that the second mate was to blame for not having in time adopted measures to avoid al risk of collision with either the schooner or the Xenis; that when the pilot camne on deck it was too late to take any safe measures* that 'no blame attached to the enis in any respect whatever; 'that it was 'not safe for her to have altered her course at any period of these transactions. Decree accordlugly. THE CHRISTINDE-COLfL5ITo. This was an action brought by the French schooner Diane against the Norwegian brig Christine to obtain compeAsation for the loss sustained by reason of a collision between them at 8 am. on the 8th of December last'in Dover Roads. The schooner had been compelled to come to anchor pn the 6th in consequence of contrary winds,'aind'she alleged that the brig which came to anchor on the following day gave her a foul berth, which subsequently led to the damage of which she complained. The brig, on the contrary, con-- tended that it arose from the driving of the schooner. Dr. BAvrosw and Dr. Twvisswere heard for the schooner;Dr. DasxxE and Dr. SPIExS for the brig. The COURT, after conferring with the Elder Brethren, said they were of opinion that the brig was solely to blame. Decree accordingly.

These payments, however, went no further back than 1819. For the defendant it was contended that there was no right of ferry in the plaintiff whatever, but the ferry was a free one for anybody that kept a boat, and it was absurd to presume a grant of right of ferry from a payment of rent in respect of the ferry, whichwas not shown to have existed before 1S19. Various witnesses proved having ferried people over whenever they pleased without acinowledging tho right of the owner of the ferry-house to exact any toll, or paying any to him. The case occupied the whole day unt 7 o'clock, when the Cout rose, and ended in a verdict for the defendant.

Gents, barrster, attende for Mr. Bent, u- ho3sterer (the prosecutor), Tottenhamn-court-road;- and MIr. Herring was engaed for the prisoner. The depositions of the previous examination of the wittnesses havn g been read, Mrr. Jarmanl said that the 3Mit had no intention to prosecate, as it had been ascertained that the prLoner, bemg a foreigner, had been imposed on by persons who had aed counterfeit coins at his shop, and that he was a uly respectable man. Mr. Herring said, that a girl had been in custody, and. examined at Marlborough-street polioe-court, who had ad-' mitted that she had passed counterfeit half-crowns at the prosecutoess shop. The prisoner had been accompanied to that court by several influential and most respectable merchants and tradesmen, who had comne forward to give their testimony to the honourable characterof the prisoner. He then observed that the prosecutor in thiscase stated that he Teceived 2L. Bs. in silver from the prLoner, which was paid to his (prosecutoes) servant. The' servant looked over the money, and found a counterfeit half-crown, but he saw no other base one. This 'was exchanged by the prisoner. The prosecutor next looked over the silver and found another one, but thinking all the rest of the silver good he paid it to another man, who also found. a bad half-crown. He thoughtit unfair to his client thatthe prosecutor and his servantwere not able to detectthatwhich was discovered by the man who fmnallyreceivedthemoney, and, if they were liible to receive a counterfeit coin, how mtch more hkely was it a foreigner should be mistaken?' He called the following witnesses - MEr. Samuel Burdett, traveller to the firm of Woolf and Baker, importers of fancy goods, City, said, he was 'in the shop when the prosecutoir s man came with a sofa-bedstead. for the prisoner, who gave him 45s. The man looked careflly over the money, and said that ahalf-crown was bad. He asked witness's opinion of it, observing that he (pri- soner) was not much of a judge of silver. Witness said. it was a counterfeit. He alw.ays found the prisoner a mosthonourable man. Mir. Abraham Crofton Rippon, wholesale-tobacconist, had. known the prisoner since he set up business, in September, 1854. Prisoner had paid him in the course of that time 58L., and he never had any bad money from him. Mr. C. Roberts, of the firm of Roberts and Co., wholesale-tobacconists, St. John-street, had been paid by the prisoner nearly 4001. duringthe same period, and had received. no bad money. Mr. Herring had other witnesses, but The prisoner was discharged.

As the accommodation is limited to0 officers, appEcation, as above, must be made withoutt a day's delay." An advance equadron will proceed to the Baltic forthwith, comprising Her Majesty's ihips Imperieuse, Il (screw), Captain E. B. Watson, C.B.; the Euryalus, 51 (screw), Captain George Rainsay, C.B.; the Pylades, 21 (screw), Captain D'Eyncourt; the D)ragon, 6, paddle frigate, Captain B.

They are all prepared for sea, and will be under the orders of Captain Watson, who is the senor captin of them. Ther will probably leave for the Downs, and start thence for Xiel, if the Belts be open. They will await further orders from the Admiralty at KieL The blockade will depend utpon the progress ansi tone of the forthcoming negotiationa. The Arrogant, 47 (screw), Captain Lyster, will probably join this advance squadron. She will go to Spithead on Monday next. The Colossus, 81 (screw), Captain the Hon. H.

She is of 670 tons, and is to be armed with two Lancaster guns, 68pounders, of 95 cwt. each, which will be worked on pivots the foreside of the funnel, one on each side, also one pivot 32-pounder of 56 cwt., to be carried forward; the other two are to be light 32-pounders. The 3Mohawk, a sister vessel, has also arrived from the contractor, and the Sparrowhawk is shortly expected; also the Assurance and Cormorant. The whole of these vessels are to be ready so = to take part in any operations which may ensue in the Baltic or elsewhere this spring. Eight mortar-vessels are nlso ordered to be fitted out at Chatham for the like service. The finding of the Court-martia which sat on board Her Majesty's ship Victory on Tuesday, for the trial of Commander Crang and Mr. Green, the master of Her Majesty's steam sloop Perseverance, for getting that vessel a-ground on Portland Bill on the 7th inst., was " that the charge had been proved, and that both officers be severely reprimanded, and admonished to be more careful in future." The steam transport Alps, No. 82, Captain Robert Inglis, arrived at Spithead yesterday from the East. She left Constantinople on the 4th inst., with Lieutenant Nutting, of the 19th Regiment ; Captain Harness, Turkish Contiugent; Major Lewes (Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-General), of the3d ; Civil-Surgeon Glover; Captain Srinton, 3d Dragoon Guards; Civil-Surgeon Rowden; Staff-Surgeon B3arrow (in charge of invalids); one prisoner of the 93d Highlanders; one woman, one sergeant of Turkish Contingent, and two civilians.

Balckew and Vaughan, of Middleburg, is shipping a cargo of rejected shot from the Ordnance Department at Woolwich. During the visit which the Lords of the Admiralty paid on Saturday last toW.oolwich Dockyard, for the special inspection of the gunboats, it was suggested by Mr. Green, the master of the despatch vessel Coquette, that a handing and return scuttle should be cut on the lower deck of that class of war.vessels, so as to form a direct communication from -the handing-room to the upper deck, which plan would considebably facilitate the supply of powder, it being at present conveyed the entire length of the store-room and lower deck. The proposition having been found useful, was immediately approved by their lrdships, and it has been ordered to be carried into effect. Every exertion is being made by the officers and men of the Coquette to get ready for sea. The ship will be,out of the hands of the artificers of the dockyard by Saturday, and the ship's company will turned over on the following Monday.

RAlLWAY INTBLLIGBNCE. MLANDM - .Je saI-yearly meeting of this company was held at Derby onw ednesday. 'r. John Ellis, the chairmanof the board of directors, presided. An abshtact of the report and accounts for the half-year has appeared in The Ximcs. Thereport of Mr. Barlow, the engineer, stated that during the half-year 42 miles of single line had been relaid, and 61 miles of single line flsh-iointed. The CHAILMAN sMid the present was the most satisfactory report he had ever had the honour of bringing before them since he had been appointed their chairman. At the time he was elected to that situation their affairs were at a very low ebb. They had, however, improved, and he hoped they would still further improve, but still they were able to pay only a small dividend. It had'been reduced from 7percent. to almost nothing, and now it was only at the rate of 3i per cent. per annum. They were aware1iow this had been. Ten years ago, as they would recollect, the Midland was the only railway route to the north; but since that period the North British, the Caledonian, the Great Xorther and other lines had been established, and diverted a great portion of their traffic. There was a deficiency of nota ess tban73,887l. in the returns of the passenger traffic for 1855 in comparison with the amount received inL 1847. The great increase had been in the trafiEc in minerals. In speaking of the amount of dividends paid by the Midland Company, ho (the chairman) wished to allude tt what was reported to have been said by Mr. Ricardo at the late meettnc of the North Staffordshire Companty. That gentleman, in allulsion to their own dividend, remnarked that the directors of the North Staffordshire line calculated that if the Midland were able to pay S per cent. they, the North Staffordshire, shorld be able to do the same. Now. the Midland never did pay 8 per cent., although they had paid 7 per cent.; but he totally denied that they had ever paid a dividend at all out of capital; and he regretted that Mr. Ricardo should have made the statements imputed to him. He was sorry to say that in consequence of the war, as he believed, in a great degree, the corn trade with Glocester was considerably less; it was, indeed, alniost annihilated. They were still in want of engines for theirgoods tramis, and, in addition to the new ones required, the alteration of many from the broad to the narrow gauge, as well as the same alterationt in the trrxcks and carriages on the line between Glocester and Bristol, would entaila considerable expense, and was paid entirely orUt of aevenue. (Hear, hear.) The Leicester and Hitchin line was proceeding very satisfactorily, and he had reason to bdieve that if the weather was favourable they Ehould open it about the latter end of October. When completed they would have an excellent line. He was still of opinion that it was a wise step to constrtct the Hitehin branch. The interest paid for loans required for its constrcion wias alwrays charged to revenue, and not to capital. The rate of debentrtre interest which they paid was only 4!. 2Jd. pcer cent., .tnd when they tooke into consideration tSe stats of the moneymarket, they would consider that it *as satisfactory. Although the rate of dividend was the same as last year, the reserve fund was increased by 15,000t. They wereaware that they had a capital bill before Parliament, by which they sought to raise 900,000l; they were so nearly up that they mnst eitherobtain additional capital, or step their expenditure altogether. The'auditors, they would perceive had ca'led their attention tothe great inrease of capital which had taken place since 1849. He was glad they had done so, forby sodoing the shareholders would see how the money had been expended. There was annual rent-charge on the Leeds and-Bradford Railway had been capitalized, the amount being 2,099,999I. the expenditure on account of new lines, 843,8701.; extra weight of materials used in the renewal of the permanent way, 120,296W.; new constructions, such as workshops or engine-honses, and additions to existing stations and works, as at Rugby, Burton, and Nuneaton; and new sidings, which the increase of mineral traflic had rendered necessary throughout the line, 417,5281. - new working-stoce, authorized by general meetings to bepaid out from capital, 371,2371. , payments in the discharge of liabilities of 1849, 584,0On. - total increase of capital account since 1849, 4,436,9371. This they woud see was for a period of about 6A ears He (the chairman) was out of office that day iy rotation, and he would wilingly answer for the acts of the directors for the last seven years. He then referred to the unfortunate differences now existing between the London and North-Western, the Midland, and Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire companies on the one hand, and the Great Northern on the other. After alluding to some previous agreement made with several companies with respect to the northern traffic, he caUed the attention of the meeting to the " Gladstone agreement," which expired in December last, and which had reference to the traffic of 12 towns. His anxiety was that this unseemly quarrel should be put an end to-a quarrel which helooked upon as a scandal to the railway interests. (Hear, hear.) If ever a man had triedjhard, he had, to reconcile all differences which unfortunately existed between the cornanies. The hon. gentleman proceeded to show that the Midland and the NorthWestern and Lincolnshire companies were prepared to stand by the Gladstone agreement, and to complain that throughoutthepo cyof lr. Denison and the Great Northern Company had been aggressive. He referred to the purehase of the Eastern counties traffic at Peterhorough, for which Mr. Denison paid 20 per cent., the Amber&ate communication with Nottingham, and the treaty with Lord Exeter with regard to the short line in the neighbourhood of Stamford. He (the chairman) wished the shareholders of the Midland to understand their own position; he believed the quarrel was chiefly to be attributed to Mr. Denizen. They uaust not give up everything aswed for, but be ,reped to dofend their own interests. (Cheers.) He (Mr. Elis) should do all in his power to bring about a settlement of the iresent quarrel, and, in condusion, moved the adoption Mr. JO-NES wished to Inow what was the intention of the directors with regard to the disposal of the new capital they The CHAIRM.i replied that it was for the purposes of the railway generally; alnd he could not answer for its ap- pliatoninan prticula5rwy A long conversation ensued, in the course of which Mr. Gee, of Nottingham, complained that so large a sum as 33,000!. had been reserv-ed. Hfe thought the directors might have given them a dividend after the rate of 4 per cent The CHArnusr.& hoped the shareholders wenl not, unner circumstances, ask for it this time; but next half-year he would premise them, if traffics remained good, to advocate an even dividend. The report wvas then adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 31 per cent. carzied. Mr. BAINerS of Leeds, moved a resolution which was acceded to by the directors, to the effect that in future the directors should give notice of all future proposed outlays of capital, so that the shareholders should have an opportunity of sanctioning or rejecting such expenditure. The motion was carried unanimously. Mr. Ellis and the rest of the retiring directors were reelected, and the meeting broke up. STAINES, WOKNGEA3, AND WORING. The hafyearly meeting of this company was held yesterday,at the London Tavern, Mfr. J. Garrardin the chair. The directors congratulated their brother shareholders on having carried on the works through thetime of monetary pressure without any serious inconvenience, and on arrangements being made for the conpletion of the undertakng. The capital account showed that 274,875!. had been received, and 252,077. expended, leaving a balance of The C ASri.N u, in movig the adoption of the report, said that every effort haI been made to open the line without delay. The directors and the contractor had the greatest interest in opening the line, as they held nine-tenths of the shares. Negotiations for vorking arrangements with the London and South-Western Company were now going on, in accordance with an understanding come to with the South-Westem board in 185L The negotiations on the part of the Wokingham Company were conducted by Mr. Eawkshaw, the engneer-in-chief of the line. The secretary of the South-WVester had intimated to hiin (the chairman) that a deputation of the SouthWestern boardl would be prepared to meet a deputation of the Staines and Wongham Company on the 2Sth inst. There was every desire on the part of the board to carry ou,t the arrangement with the South-Western Company, as the line, in fact, formed part of their system. There could be no doubt that Mr. Hawkshaw, their able engineer, was fullg prepared to make the necessary arrangements w aet com ny or with another party for working the traffic. The contractor had made arrangements for opening the line in May next. Before the next meeting e trafc would be passing over it, and he had no doubt it would become a valuable property. Some of the estates on the line had changed hands, and building had been comnaencedL It was very probable that the Woldngham line would form part of a direct narrow galuge line from Reading to LAondon, and would be nearer by 30 miles than the other. A comparatively smaU traffic for a branch line would give them a good dividend. Mr. K ?XAUD seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously. Mtr. HAwsnAsw, in reply to questions, statel that ninetenths of the ea-thhwork and masonit were completed, and there was nothing to prevent the line being opened for traffic in May. The iron cyliders for the Pirs of the bridgre over the Thames had been sunk 18feet beow fe bed of the river, and there only remained the superstructure, vwhich could be put up in aboutsix weekcs. He had no doubt that ina week or two the arrangements forworking the line would be con- A vote of thanks to the chairma and directors concluded the proceedings. NORTHERN AND EASTERN. At the half- yearly meeting of this company, held yesterday at the Bishopsgate station, Mr. Paterson in the chair, thenlsual dividends, at the rate of 5 per cent. and 6 per cant. perannum on the g nteed shares, were declared for the half-year ending the 31st of December last. BIRKENHEAD, LNCASHWRE, ANiD CESIRE JUNCTIION In consequene of the Great Western lRailway Company exercing their powers of runnin over the above line, the amount of eekly traffic receipts wrill notbc published until an award is made by the arbitrators appomnted to fix the tolls. AMBERGATE, NOTTINGHAU, AND BOSTON. The renozt of the directors of this company states that their anticipation of an increased dividend has been realized. Out of the net earnings they propose a dividend of 2s. d. per share, or 10,567., payable on the 29th inst., leaving a balanca of 1,317!. The necessary niotices for the purchase of landfor the new rline into and station at Nottingham have been given, and contracts have been entered into for the construction, of the approaches to the station The amount paid to the Midland Company for toll. and station rent during the past six months has emceeded 3,500., or 7,000L per annum. TChe 19,000. paid on ccount of tho line to Buwall has been received from the Mlidland Comn- capital account ahows that 747,666.- had been received, and 743,259!. expended, leaving a balance of 4,407!, The revenue account for the half.year showred that 15,480!. had been received, zan 3,783, expende, leavig abalace of 11,8851., including 188l. franz lasteaccount. ILONDONDEIRR1Y AND ENNIS=1Th.'l~ -The directors of this company state n their report that the ~traffie receipts for the ha'sf-year ending the 1t of Deeember lsast amounted to 18,459t., being an averageof 710. per wreek. The lhne wass not-completed and owened throughOlltto EnnlsldllenL until the 21st of Ausgust, 1854. A comnfsas0on of the hlf-year's traffic therefore cannot ie rade but from the 1st of September to the end of the year 1854 the receipts auiounted to 9,8t14, and for the same period in 1855 the receipts amounted to 12,707l,, showin an increasc of 2,902t., or rather more Than 29 per cent. over the corresponding period of 1854 The directors view this increase as a satisfactory proof that the traffic of the ryailway is elastic and capable of extension. They believe that the existing trade might be materially increased and new elernents of traffic developed. The working expenses have been-considerably diminished in the past as compared with the'preceding half-year, and the directors look confideutly forward to frther reduction. The rolling stock is below the requirements of the line, both in locomotive power and won accommodation, notwithstanding which the trains have kept timepunctually, a.nd the goods and cattle trade have been conducted with regularity and satisfaction to the public. Much attention has been given during the halfyear by T.he directors and the engineer-in-chief towards improving the condition anud decrensug the cost of the maintenance of the pernanent way. The necessity to mako early provison for the lIhbilities of the company is unavoidable. With a sview to obtain the necessatry funds (about 30,000.) the directors have applied to Parliament for au thority to issue the unsubscribed residue of the new capital, with in piority of dividend over the other shs rco of the company.Thebastlacoof G,U17.atcreditof profitand( lomssaccounlt IS sufficient to give 6s. per tphare, or a fracti on unmler Gi por cent, per annumn on tho originsds preference shiares, -whioh dividend the directors reconnnend to bie declared; hlnt, from the imperative necessity ot applying all avsilaldle funds in discharge of the aapital debts, they are imal)le to name a tine for payment ot this dividendl.

Thl iost friendly disposition continues to prevail between the directors and the Newry and EnnisdUen 'ooard. The revenue account s8ows a balance in favour of the shareholders of 789L, whicch is a-7ailable for dividend; but the directors consider it inoro expedient to retain it for the present.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES, Sir,-Adverting to a letter from Mr. James Walker in Tle Times of to-day, it must, I think, be evident to any one acquainted vith my statement to which it refers, that simply alluded to the foundations in the river, as having caused an increase of the cost and a delay in the progress of the works of the New Palace at Westminster, and that it has no other bearing upon the question unfortunately at issue between the Government and myself. As to the statements in that letter relative to the river embanlkment wall, which forms a portion only of the foundation of the new palace in the river, I have meielyto observe that the construction of it was intrusted to Messis. Walker and Buiges conjointly with myself; that tho requisite drawings, specification, and contract were prepared with my assistance and concurrence; that I constantly shared in the direction of the works during their progress ; that I caused more than one important modification to be made in them, upon which I rely mainly for the safety of the embanklnent and its supestructure; that the works were finally examined and certified by 8s conjointly; and that we shared equally the accustomed commission of 5 per cent. paid by the Government upon the cost of them. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, UÃ¯Â¿Â½LIA4 BARRY. L, Old Palace-yard, Feb. 2L
"ROBINSON V. KITCH2EN." TO T EDITOR OF TE TIMES. Sir,-In your report of this case it is Etated that, although the rev. plaintiff, in the face of society, avowed himself a participator in such matters as the bill disclosed, and wishing that he (the LordJustice) could refuse him his costs, he must let him have them, and agree in dismisiing the appeal wsith costs." As the inference which would naturally be drawn from this statement by a person unacquainted with the facts of the case cannot be otherwise than unfavourable and unjust to myself, you will perhaps allow me to state in 2fe Titmes that the extent of my participation-culpable as it is made to appear-was merely to authorie the defendants, as my brokers, to buy or sell shares and other securities on my account. The severity of those remarks in which the learned judge thoughtproper to indulge, in consequence of my being bound by an anomaloulslaw"to a profession the priciples of which I cannot conscientiously hold, will have but little effect upon the mind of any candid man when he is informed, as lord Justice Knight Bruce was bv my co>nncol tht I had virt.llyI .band.snvd sue csers il profession, not having for several years past taken any active part in its duties, and that I was only waiting for an opportumity to be afforded by an act of which, at the close of last session, lord Brougham had given notice, to enable me to retire from it legally. I amn, Sir, your obedient sersant. DAVID RO1RTN901M 4, 1nutand-gate, tiyde Yark, Feb. 20.
ROGES'S TABLE-TALK. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In The flmnw of this morning I an charged by Ir. Hamton Gray with misrepresenting (or rather with inventing) some words respecting Mrs. Piozzi and her daughters, which form a portion of the recently published Table-tfelk of Samud Boger. " I had,' says Mr. Hamilton Gray, " the pleasure of the acquaintance of the late 3r. Rogers, and as I believe he was in the habit of speaking truth, I am convinced that his. table-talk never did comprise such statements as the above." That Mr. Rogers always intended to speak the truth is not to be doubted. His memory, however, occasionally deceived him. Such may have been the case with respect to the " statemente' in question; but that I have heard them made by Mr. Roers on more than .one occasion, exactly as they are given in the Table-talk, I most positively assert; and I am much mistaken if several gentlemen, who, like myself, were constant visitors in St. James's-place, would not at once confirm my assertion. I must be allowed to add, that the Table-ta7lk bears throughout such evidence of my anxiety to report the conversation of Mr. Rogers with correctness, as ought to have saved me from the impertinence of Mr. Hamilton Gray. _ Your obedient servant. tJi r:Xu 01R' -OES' RABLE-TA4 T7 .Feb. 20.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I shall feel obliged by your permitting me to call the attention of the public-for I know no other mode of doing so-to the inconsistency of sending messages to medical men by the electric telegraph, requesting them " to come as qcky as possible," and neglecting to direct that they be forwarded immediately, or by special messenger. For instance, I received a message this morning from Wat. ford, which was one houlr coming from Churing-cross. Trans won't tarry for tardy messengers.

THE FxAE OBrNAw AsRIvu.-The triennial festival of thislong-establishedand useful charity took placc last night at the London Tavern, and was attended by abut 150 gentlemen, and presided over by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge. Among the company were the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. T. Hankey, jun.; the Rev. lIz. Cattley, Mr. L Cattley, lIz. T. England, rr R. Gibbs, and many others, who during a series of years have shown a zealous interest in the welfare of the institution. The asylunm, which was founded in 1758, is now approaching its centenary, and some idea of the good which it nsli effected may be formed when we mention that it at present supports lGS orphan girls, and has since itsestablishment maintained and educated an aggregate of 2,659. His RoyalHighness, the President, in discharging the duties of the chair, manifested a more than usual earnestness, and his efforts were so successful that in the course of the evening subscriptions were announced to the amount of 1,000L and apwards. It would seem that the annual expenditure of the charity considerably exceeds its income derived from funded property, and that the sums collected at the trienual dinners barely suffice to cover that excess. The committee of management, as far as they can, carefully maintain that preference for the orphan daughters of soldiers and sailors which was recognized as a feature of the institution at its foundation. The girls are now kept to the age of 17, or even 1S, before being apprenticed, as it is found better to do so than to send them out into the world at 15, before their con stioations a fe formed. About 70 of them were paraded round the tlining-hal of the London Tavern last nighit and their heathy, clean, and well-cared-for appearance gave general satisfaction to the company. Some of the older girls are almost grown up young women, and quite fit to enter into service. The dinner and all the arrangementsconnected withit were unexceptionable. STATE OF TFADE.-MAxcnEsm, Feb. 21.-'The cloth-market has been firm, bat very quiet. There are still a good many orders in the hands of manufactarers, as well as spinners, but very little new business has been done this morning. The unfavourable rumours asd to the probability of a peace being concluded no doubt are one cause of the indisposition of buyers to enter upon new engagements, and the high prices necessitated by the state of the cottonmarket continue to exercise a disooaraOing inflaeuce. The home trade houses have been rather busier of late, and by Eome of them rather a large business is doing.

THE APPELLATE .TUB1SDICTIOT OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS. TO THE EDITOR OF TBE TMES. Sir, I have read an article in 27we Ties of Wednesday, written on the subject of life peerages, in which is to be found the following sentence relating to the judicial business of the House of Lords:- " They (the Peers) alone imagine that when they have decided the life peerage question in their own favour, they will have, together with that question, laid at rest the scandal of their administration of justice, that they will return to their old channel, and that the public will be content, as heretofore, with hearing Lord Cranwortlh speak one wy, and Lord St. Leonard's the other, or with the decision given by a third judge, who arrives in time to give his casting vote without having heard the argument." Permit me, as the official reporter of the English and Irish cases, the duties of which office have compelled me to have a very exact knowledge of the judicial proceedings of the House of Lords, to assure you that, as to those cases, ihe writer of the article in question has been entirely misinformed. No judicial decision of the House has been arrived at in that way; no law lord has taken part in delivering a judgment without having heard the arguments. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your very obedient servanit, CHARLES CLAI,X Temple, Ã¯Â¿Â½eb. 2L
SIR G. Gs PorLcE B=.-At the last quarterly meeting of the Bradford town-conncil, the Mayor (Mr. W. Murgatroyd) called attention to the above bill, and produced a petition against it, showing that Bradford, with a population of 120,000, had a force of 121 constables, ineluding the chief superintendent, and protesting against the bill as nnnecessary and inexpedient, and as trenching upon the liberty of boroughs. Alderman Beaumont declared his opinion that the bill was fraught with danger to the constitution. Alderman R.md said he believed if they opposed the whole bill theywould signaRy fail; he contended that the detection and prevention of crime were a duty of the Government, and while he ad. anitted there were objectionable clauses in the bill, he con. curred in the polcy of appointing general inspectors of the police force throughout the country. The Mayor also expressed his belief that some Government control was requisite, so that the whole of the police might co-operate in the detection and prevention of crime; but he did not agree with all the provisions of the bill before Parliament. Ultimately the pettion was adopted and a deputation was appointed to &Ã¯Â¿Â½ to London the next d eay Wdnsay). smry minute of the 10th of August, 1855, appointed a com. mnission of inquiry into the erection of district lunatic asylumsin Ireland. The report of this commission has just been publshed, whence it appears that a regular tour of inspection was made, and several asylums visited by the commissioners. The report emphatically notices the great advance made of late years in the interest of humanity, in ireland, by the erection of new asylums, whereby the sad condition of the insane poor las been so materially alleviated, and additional jzrovision made for the care and treatment of more than ,500 patients, at a cost of more than 340,0001. To effect this there has been an earnest co-operation on the part of the Government authorities, the officers of the Board of Worlts, ond, in many cases, of the governors of the asylums. Ample and convenient sites have generally been purchased on h,gh and healthy positions, and commanding views of the loveliest scenery. she accommodation has been generally comaplete, being founded on some carefully drawn instrucions by the officers of the Board of Works. As 2egards the existing asylums, the abolition of the present too gaol-like character of many of them is strongly recommended, on the ground that lunatic asylums are hospitals of cure, and not prisons for the safe custody of violent madmen. - In -this respect the new asylums present a very favourable contrast to the old ones. The style of architecture best suited to the general quality of the building materials in Ireland is Ã¯Â¿Â½he Gothic, no external coating of stucco or other composition being allowable under any circumstances. At Cork and liqg.an excess of ornament is notieed in the asylums beyond w t is suitable for such institutions. The vanuusrecommendations of the commissioners have been approved and adopted by the Treasury.
I THE BOROUrGHS AND C0t7NTIES POZICE BIZLL. '*DEPUTATION TO SI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GEOROR GRIW~~~~~~~~~~ Yesterday, at 2 O'clock, a numerous and influential deputation of mayors'and other civic and muiicipal authorities from various cities and towns inthe kingdom, accmpanied by a large number of members of Parliament, waited upon Sir George Grey, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, at the Home-office, by ap.- poiutment, to express the feelings of alarm and repug-; nance with which they regard the bill recently introduced by Lim into the House of Commons for providing a more efficient system of police throtrghout the country. The deputation consisted, among other municipal functionaries, of the Mayors of York, Ieeds, Birmingham, Southampton, Wakefield, Bolton, Doncaster, Chichester, Halifax, Banbury, Brighton, Portemouth, Bedford, Droitwich, Sunderland, Nottingham, Hull, Hrtlepool, and other places; and among the members of - Parliament present were Sir George Strickland,, Mr. Roebuck, Lord H. LInnox, Mr. Walter, Mr. Wilox, Mr. WVickham, Mr. Oliveira, Mr. G. Butt, Mr. Tite, Mr. Horsfall, Captain Scohell, Dr. Michel, Mr. C. Forstsr, Mr. Wells, ir. Crossley, Mr. laslett, Mr. Mowatt, Mr. Tancred, Sir W. fimlner, Mr. Crook, Mr. Ridley, Mr. Hadfield, hfr. J. C. Ewart, Sir George Goodm, Mr. Scholefield, and many other. The de i assemled first at Herbert's Hotel, Palace-yard, Westminster, at 1 o'clock, and, having arranged their course of procedure, went in a body-and a formidable one it was in point of! numbers-to the Home-office, where they were admitted to an interview with the Secretary of Statc. The LitD MAYon of Yomc, who had been previously appointed their spokesman, said, addressing Sir George Grey, he had first to thank him on the part of the de utation for the courtesy which the righthon. baronet had shown in favouring them nith an intirview. He need scarcely say they appearedbefore him as a deputation from a large meeting, held at Herbert's Hotel on the previous day, of mayors and other delegates from various municipalities thoughout the kingdom. It was not in his power to convey to him (Sir Ceorge Grey) in words an adequate notion of the mtenaity and unanimity of feeling which had characterized the meeting of the precediug day agaiyst the Counties and Boroughs Police Bil now before Parliament under the auspices of the Government. lHear, hear.) They objected to that bill on account of its being pervaded with the principle of centarlization (cheers), andenaccount of its transferring to the Government of the day so much of the powers of the local authorities in a matter of such vital importance as that of the regultion and maintenance of the police. They protested against it as an inroad on the principle of self-government, serious I in itself, and stiU more serious as a platform for further aggression. (Chba rfe) They were n-t, (a municialities, asking, and they never had asked, for the moncy of thc Governbent, andw they protested against the interference of the ome-office in this matterhas uncoustitutiona and dangerous. I any of them felt the more nggrieved that these repeated alulds on their local liberties and privileges should be rnade by a professedly Liberal Government (hear); andthey als complained that, after theirremionstrainces on princle Lad bern allowed to prevail against a kindred mea sure in 1854, a Government substantially the same should, in 18p , again harassethemwithos t any immedieate ocsironorg report of any committee of the House of Commons to justiHy it. They would again make reference, as they did on a former occaswon, to the report of the committee of the House of Commons on which t t Police Biyswhich had smce been introduced were founded. It was fsllyoxplained to lord Palmerstonin 1854 byMr.sldermanLeemtat, then LordmMeaior of York, that, looking tthe circumstances underwhich that committee was p pointed, nd at the Class of witnesses-who were examined before it, it was unfair to ground upon it any interference with the poEce of the boroghns. The deputation, therefore, most earnestly requested Sir George Grey and the Government to withdrawr this bill inh foto. (Hear, hear.) They wrould rather that he and the Government would openiy take away their munipal charters (cheers); they would rather that they openly repealed their municipal acts than indirectly destroyed their local indc pendence, and left them merely a cnieni nobniint umbrea ( Cheers.) The Lord Mayor then handed in to Sir George copies oE the resolutions imanimously agreed to at the meeting on the previous day the faist of which stated that they objected strongly o tohe appaent tendency of legislation towards centralzaton as subversive of that principle of local selfgovernment, which wsssocongenial to the Spirit of this free nation, and which experience had shown to have m terially contributed to advance the prosperity and promote the liberties of the county. The second set forth that they felt hound to ofer to the Counties and Boroughs Police Bill their most strenuous opposition, while they regarded at the saoe time the continued endeavonrs of the Government to reduce the rsponsible representatMves of free municipal constituencies to the condition of mere fiscal agents of a Minister of the Crown as calculated to subvert and destroy the phin.inles of local self-government deliberately recognized by Parhament, and confirmed and extended to the people by the Msnicipal reform Act. Sir G. GBEY asked if he ras to Cuderstand that the object of the P resent deputaMion was, not to offer any suggestions with the view tothe amemenent of the bill, butte state the uainmous opinion of the deputation that the bill was objectionable in all its parts, and that no modificaton of it could make it areeable to thems The Mayor of YORn said that wras the object of the de nG. GBSY said, that beingso, hecould onlypsay le was much obliged to the denutation for fsunishing him with that expression of their opinion. He had read in the newspapers of that morning the report of the proceedings of the meetingonthepreviousday,and he fully concured with an observation which fell from the hon. and learned memoer for Sheffleld (Mr. oeocnt ) at that meet t ing, that the proper place to discuss the pbrieiples of the bill was the HIouse of Commons. wi that Morsenafter hearing the argumentst hichw rroldbe adiced for and aganset the bil, thought fit to reject it, he was prepared to submit to its decision- but ho submitted to the deputation that it would he wrongs in him to express an Opinion in the absence of those who were ready to support the bill and in the presence only of those who were altogether opposed to it. He could not agree to the request to withdraw the bill -and he should, on an early occasion, in his place in the house of Commonsw state before the Eouse and the country the grounds onwhich the Government had thought ititheirdutytopropose it; and it woul thenbe for the ounse to decide the matter at issue. He did not wish for a moment to coenrovert the justice of the resolutions which had been passed at the meeting, hut only to say they furnished matter for argument on beth sides. ur. C. FOssm, MY., said, after the statement which had bcen made by Sir Geerge Grey, he vras determined to persevere in the amendment of which he had givennotice,that, on the motion for the second reading of the bilU, he should move that it be read a second time that day six months. He regarded the bill as a dangerous increase of the power of the Executive, and an unfair interferencewith the liberties and privileges of the municipalities which there was nothing to justify. It had already occasioned a great deal of had blood in the country, and he should feel glad if the Government would wBhdraw the bill altogether. He wished to ask if Sir George meant to brig on the motion for its second reading on Wednesday next. Sir G. GREY said, he did not meanpto bin ou emotion for the second reading on ednesday next, that being a day on which the Government had no control in arrangeng the business before the Eouse. He would give noice in the lhose of his intention to postpone the second reading, and ewould afterwards tae the earliest day at the disposal of the Government for bringing it forwvard, of which he should taite care to give due notice. The deputation then withdrew, and on their return to Herbert's Hotel, The Mlayor of PocRself-gov expressed his regretthat the deputaion, formidable as it was, had produaced no mpres sion on the mind of Sir George Grey, and that it was eoident he intended to press the second reading of the bill in qveston. He trusted that an effort would be made to impress upon the members of all the boronghs in the kingdom the neceasity of giving a sttrenuous and uiited opposition to so eentralizin and despotie a measure. If such aobill passed the -eature it would infflct a deep amd irremediable stab on the consttuMton of the contry. (Hear, hear.) H3e moved a resolution to the effect that the answer given by Sir G. Grey to the depuatiMon imperatively called on the meeting to take the most energetic and immediate measures for carrying into effect the resolutions passed at the meeting of the previous day. Alderman H. B. H3OOLE: of Sheffield, in seconding the resolution, said, if such a bill passed, theof S toudo all in their powver to make the office of the ome Secretary untenable by a man who had inflicted so deep a wound on the principle of local self-government. The resolution was put, and carried unanimously. On the motion of the Mayor of BIRMLNsGHrAM, seconded bythe Mayo f Hun, an appeal wras directed to be made to althe independent members in the House of Commons, to uphold, by their votes on this bill, the principle of local independence and self-government, both in the counties and boroughs. The meeting wras subsequently addressed by the Mayor of Brighton,;Mr. Alderman Cullen, of *Nottingham;* Captain Scobell; Mr. Dunn, a member of the tow;n councii of Mewcastle-upon-Tyne; the Mayors of Southampton and Stratford-on-Avon, Mr. LJaslett, M.P * Mr. Alderman Irving, of Carlisle, and other gentlemen. MWr. IloxaucK, MiP., said, the MWayor of Southampton had stated that, when the nature of this bill became known in that town, everything was done that could be done to agitate the constituency inreference to it, and he Mxr. Roebuclel wantedeverythingdTonethat conldbe done to aEitatethemem bers of the House of Commons.(A laugh.) The b'l could not be defeated by nerely exciting the constituencies and making them uncomfortable, but also by aitating the members and maldng them uncomfortable. (e ar.) They should determine when the bill came again before the House not only that every member should be provided with a copy oftheresolutionsthathad beenpassedat thismeeting, butalso with a resolution from their constituences that they would be supported in future just in proporton to their opposition tothshill. (A laugh.} He recollected who it was that represented Southampton in the House of Commons * aword from that hon. and learned gentleman against the bilwould go far to defeat it, and a word from the constituency of Southampn to that hon. and learned gentleman would go far with n (A laugIh) Sir G. STRicKLs.Da , 1LP., expressed his astonishment at the infatnation which could have induoed the Government to bring forward a second measure ef this kind, which could only load them with the opprobrium of the whole nation. After the examples the country had had ,of the perfect inability of the publio departments to conduct the affairs of war, they must have only brought forward this measure to show their iuability to manage the peace in the country. (H[ear, hear.) A subscription was entered into in the room towards defraying the expense of opposing the bill, and the proceedings terminated with a vtot of thaÃ¯Â¿Â½ka to the Myorof York thebilityCwith which he had expressd the common the deputationbefore Sir Gcorge Grey.

After the readiag of theL statute, the Principal of St. M ar (Dr. Bliss)rose, ancT declared his intention of ooposingit both in Congregation and Convocatlon. He consid4edthat thnin-ersity as bound by the compact which it made in the year 1g, whea fixed stipens were substited for salaries depending oon fees. He read extracts from theUniversitv registerstto sSow how much the University had received under iah4 aIrangement. re complained of misstatements whichg ad been made on the last occasion, when it had been saic that the Bedels vere only employed for half theyear, and when their stipend ha been compared to that of the pablic examiners. He did not move any amendment. Dr. Pusey de. fended the statute. The Council had conside,sd vaiou plans, and had come to the conclusion that it would not do either to attach the office of Esquire Bedsl to any existing one, such as a Professorship, or to make it an absolute smecure, as at Cambridge, and therefore had proposed the present plan. They fouidthat recent changeshad only left work for four persons, and therefore proposed a reduction in the nmnber. There was no reduction in the stipends of the inferior Bedels. The duties were lght and the responsbilityvery little. Mr. G. V. Cox, of Ner Col. lege, Esquire Bedel m Arts, then rose, and expressed his regret that the statute had been so little inproveL He defended the Esquire Bedels's title to be considered gentle. men, noticing that the serviens in old times was like the squire wao attended upon a inight, and that the registrar was called serviens inthe statutes. He requested that the statute might be put to the vote in several clauses. He concluded by putting in twro amendments,-one in favou2r of the restoration of the cause dsnente ri'., una>*nsZc, omitted from the old statute; the other for asining somec remueration to the Bededs who should serve the office of Mr. Butler, of Exeter defended the statute, which had, he thought, been very carefuly prepared by the. CounciL. No other member addressing the House, the VriceChan. ce3o1r declared the Congregation dissolved. An election of a Fellow, with a preference for natives of the old diocess of Lincoln, will tal-e place in Oriel College on Eriday, MIarch the 28th.

No money was found in his pockets. Two sea-farmg men, named Jnames Carr and Philip Wall are in custody, charged with the murder -It was roved that on Tuesday night the deceased left his ldgings, with about 20s in siver in his possession; that he obtained some drink, and towards midnight fell in with a woman, with whom he was seen in the neighbourhood of Chisenhale-street, about midnight; that while taldking tow her he felldown, apparentlyintoxicated; that thenthe twc prisoners were seen to go up to him, Carr exclaiming, *' Well, slipmate, will yoa go along 'with me?' and that they led hinm away towards the entry where he was afterwards found dead. Mr. Syers, surgeon at the Vauxhal! Dispensary, stated that death had been caused by t1an-gu. lation. The jury, at 7 o'clock, returned a Terdict oE "Wilful Murder' against both prisoners. The prisoners conducted themselves in a very unconcerned marner throughout the inquiry, and laughed at each other when the verdict was given.

Grey's County tud Boro Police Bill was brought under discussion by the Mayor, 3r W. C.

Councillor Clayton expressed his disapproval of the biR aud his deternnination to ojsloseit with all his might. Councillor Battle aho consdered it decidedly objectionable, as interEering with the management of their funds. Alderman Wllians believed there vas not so mnuch reason for oaposingthe bill as might at first sight aypear. It contained several very good provisious, not the least acceptable of which was thai; which assuredthem one-fourth or the cost of the pay and cothira of the foroe, provided it were efficient. Councllcor Ward said the bill savoured too much of the principle of centrali ation, which had of late years become so fahionable 'itlh our legislators, andhe should therefore support any motiOn for defeating the measure. In the meantime, he should move that it be referred tothe Watch Commiltee to considerand report upon it, .
