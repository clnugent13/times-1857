AGRICULTURAL iMPROVEMENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The comparative state of waste in which many large estates are kept by the wvant of improvement is a loss to the country of considerable magnitude, and much good may be done by your exposing such an instance as I am about to relate, and which the e-xperience of many of your readers who have to deal with church or college estates wil say is not singular. The Dean and Chapter of Windsor are owners of extensive farms, let to tenants on leases for 21 years, which it has been the custom to renew every seven years at a low rent on payment of a proportionate fine. The general bad condition of properties so held is notorious. These gentlemen not only set their faces against parish improvements to which they may be asked to contribute-and upon this much may be said-but it will appear they are such enemies to innovation that they not only refuse to assist their tenants in nnproving their farms, but will not even give them the opportunity of doing so at their own cost. I am the lessee of a large farm of theirs in Oxfordshire which might be made very productive, but which is now almost a waste, and I aim debarred from imnproving it by its want of draining. I therefore lately applied to their steward to aid me in obtaining a Government loan to drain it, expressing my willingness to pay the whole of the rentcharge during my cccupancy of 21 years. It may be necessary to explain that the Government advances money for draining, to be repaid by an annual rentehaTge of 6A per cent. for 22 years ; but to obtain this a leaseholder for 21 years must get the lessor to join in their application. One would think tlat, as I am the lessee at a nominal rent for 21 years, and the money is to be e-xpanded in the permanent improvement of the land to at least the extent of the renteharge, the lessors would be r-ost happy to join in an application by which they would get their land permanently benefitted, at the expense of the tenant, to at least the extent of the outlay, namely, about 51. per acre ;-I say to at least the extent of the outlay, because it is only on condition that the draining shall benefit the land to this cetent that the Government advance is to be obtained ; and, in addition to the benefit from the draining, the land would further have-the advautage of the other improvements which the draining would lead to, but which its present wet state is a bar to. But no ! the steward sees the possibility of the dean and chapter having to pay the rentcharge for one year at the end of 21 years, and does not see that by that time the estate will have been benefittedby my having made 21 payments out of 22, and that I san desirous of incurring the rentcharge for 21 year from seeing that the farm must each year be benefitted more than the additional rent I undertake to pay, and at the end of my lease the lessors would come into tho improved rent my outlay would have created at the cost of one year's payment; and so, by this refusal, I must continue to hold the land in its present unimproved condition for 21 years; ani the dean and canon will, at the end of my lease, find their farm remaining in its present comparatively valueless condition; and thus their future representatives are being deprived of the improved rent which their joining in the application would secure them. But, perhaps it may be said, seeing the advantage is so great, why do I not lay out the money myself? To this there is this unfortunate objection:-Were I to do so, when the time comes, seven years h=ce, to renew my lease, the same steward would be th3 first to assess the farm at the improved rent my outlay would have created; and thus I should increase the fine I should have to pay by my own act; and this, I think, every cne in my position would dechine doing. You are, doubtless, aware that the consumption of corn by'this country has now attained to such an amount tha, we require the assistance of about 11,000,000 quarters per annum of foreign "rowth; and, this heing the case, is the production of the Yarae estates vested in trustees for th3 publicadventag,e tobAelptdown in tbiswvayby. their worsa than ignorance of their duty to their tenants, to their. suecesors, and to the nation? I think yon will see in this a subject of general importance, and I tnist I need not further apo2ogize for troubling vou and asking you to insert this in Ils Timxes. I remain, .Sir, iov-z obedient ervant. T. E. B. C. AynI:o, Northamptonsbfre, Jan. IL
,THE PUl?BC HEALTH. (Fr-',I the Registrar-General's Weeidy Reurn.) I Elevedhundred deaths were registered in london in the weekthat endedon Saturday. In the second week of the last 10 years (which corresponds to last week) the average rxiimber was 1,239. If for comparison with the deaths in the present increased population this average is raised by a tenth part, it becomes 1,363. The present state of the public health must be regarded, therefore, as comparatively good; and if last week is compared with the same week in 1854 and 1855, when the deaths rose to nearly 1,500, the result becomes still more salisfactory. This return includes 542 deaths of males ana 658 of females, and gives a total number, which, as compared with the number of births, is less by 463. Of tho 1,100 persons wvho died, 224, or about a fifth part, perished before they had completed the first year of their exdstenco; and 47 wera old men and women, on whose heads 80 winters or more hal,I gathered. Fatal cases produced by diseases of the respiratory organs have decreased in the last fortnight; the numbers in the last three returns having been 348, 253, and 238. Bronchitis, the most fatal of the diseases which constitnte this class, numbered in the same periods 204, 141, -nd 126. The return for pneumionia (or inflammation of the lungs) is not heavy for this season. Phthisis was fatal to 118 persons, thebcorrected average being 15.L 21 deaths occurred from smalL po.x, four of which took place in WVoolwich. Mr. Rixon, who registered three from that disease in the Royal Ordnance Hospital, mentions that it has been extremely prevalent there, but is now abating; that there were upwards of 39 cases at one time in that establishment, and some of the worst description. Two deaths from typhns, one from " fever," and one from erysipelas, occurred on the 5th and 8th of January in St. Luke's Workhouse. Measles carried off three very young children in the Westminster Workhouse. Last week the births of 798 boys and 7ti girls, inall 1,563 children, were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1846-55 the average number was 1,486. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was ;29-357 in. The barometer rose from 28S5 in. on Monday to 3040 in. at the end of the week. The mean temperature of the week was 36-4', which is 1-3' above the average of the same week in 38 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The air was much colder than in the two previous weeks. The mean temperature was below the average on the last four days. The highest occurred on Sunday and Monday, and was 47'; the highest on Friday was only 32g8', while the lowest in the week occurred on that day, and was 27-9Â°. The entire range of the week was, therefore, 19-1Â°. The mean dew-point temperature was 34.40, and the difference between this and the mean airtemperatire was 2. The mean temperature of the wvater of the Thames was 41-9'. The temperature of the river varied from 44-1' to 38-2Â°. The wind, which blew from the south or east at the beginning of the week, changed to north-east on Tuesday, and continued almost constantly in that direction. The amount of rain was O-89 inches, and of this amount 080 inches fell on Wednesday. Snow fell on the morning of that day.
SHBEFEBLD WARES. TO TE EDITOR OF THE TEIES. Sir,-'My position as Master Cutler of Sheffleld demands a reply to the letter which appeared in your powerfLul journal of January 1,1856, and signed " Amicus," reflecting very severely and unjustly upon the manufacturers of Sheffield. It is my intention to refute such misstatements and exnggemations as I find untrue, referring to the local maDnufactures of this rapidly-increasing and important district. I therefore select the following passage in your correspondent's letter:- "Not only have the French made rapid strides towards our excellence in the heavier departments of the mechanical arts, such as engine and tool making, and maintainied their acknowledged superiority in philosophical apparatus and what are called instrmnents of precision; but in steel mtanufacture and its numberless applications, which ve recognize as Sheffield wares-in fact, in a mnuch longer list which I could make of articles which show the application of the arts to the wants, the convenienlces, and the elegancies of life, our continental neighbours of one coantry or another are undoubtedly before us." Then again, "At Sheffield cheapness of production has long been he rage, and, indeed, the only aim of trade. As a sure conlsequence, the world has been flooded with razors t3at won't cut, saws that refuse to enter the log, and files that won't file. Sheffield wares are getting into disrepute." I beg, firmly and positively, to deny that foreigners of any country are before or equal to us in the manufacture of cutlery, files, saws, or edge-tools. No doubt other'nations produce good articles in some branches of these several trades, yet it is necessary to inquire the price of producing these good articles before saying theyare equal to us. lWhat is the result? You then find, in almost all cases, the same quality goods are produced and sold here at a very much less rate. Referring to the articles of cutlery exhibited at the Paris Exhibition, the best goods I saw there made by foreigners were of Paris production, and apparently very creditable. Yet, on inquiring the price, I found them more than 100 per cent. higher than articles could have been purchased for mn this country. The manufacturers of this town are required to suit the tastes of all couutries,-the means of every class of buyers. This at once calls forth an immense variety of goods which are offered for sale throughont the world, and which it is absolutely necessary this town should be prepared to supply; if not, merclants will go to those markets wherethey can be supplied. No doubt there are cheats in all trades and in all countries, which it is necessary for purchasers to guard against; the only remedy I can see against this is, to pay a fair and proper price foran article, purchase of a respectabla vendor, and be assured that the article purchased is bon4 jfde what it is sold for. It is wellknown that the frauds our most celebrated English makers are subject to are in having their marks pirated, their labels, and even the colouroftheir paper, copied by unprincipled foreign manufacturers, against which they have no remedy.- Of the inferiority of these goods, besides the present loss, the house who is thus robbed has to bear the penalty. Cheapness of production is not the only aim in Sheffield. There has been for some years a mnuch greater increase of manufacturers who make only good articles, anld it is patent to aU that the largest makers, who employ the greatest number of hands, are they who produce this class of goods, and who have earned a name and position which no foreign manufacturer can take away so long as they continue the same course and display the same amount of energy in con' ducting their business. My last remarks apply more particularly to the catlery trade in all its branches, with which I have had great experience. Your correspondent is lavish in his praises of the great change which has taken place in the managenent of our arsenals and other great Government establishments. Hlow is this ? Was there room for the improvements ? Do our Government establishments of the War Department so far surpass those of all other nations as the cutlery of Sheffield is superior to what is produced in any other part of the world ? I have been in the cutlery manufactories of the United States, France,Belgium, and Rusias and say with confidence to all merchants and dealers, "If you can find better cutlery in any other country than England at the same price, do not be our customers. We want no preference, and only ask fair play." "i Aicus," I presume, is not aware of the class of cutlery which our Government purchase fromSheffield for.tho War .Department, and which are materials of war as mach as powder, shot, and shell I refer to knives and forks, gabion knives, farriers' knives, butchers' knives, &c. ; these are made of the very commonest qualitythat can possibly be produced. How ever our poor soldiers manage to cut their salt porlk, or to cut wood for gabions, isamysteryto me; it iswell known in Sheffield no manufacturer who makes good articles has any chance of ever obtaining a Government contrat for cutlery, as the goods required are so common and so low in price that it is impossible to make an aMticle worthy to receive any maker's name who has any thought for his fature standing in trade. My own faia have repee.tedly sent in tenders for cutlery to our Government for the War Department. The last one we actualy priced at cost, yet never in any case have we been successful; and we learn that a firm who are not manufacturers have obtained the greater part of the contract for JTauary, 1856, and will have to distribute their orders to small makers, who produce an inferior article. Such is the system on which this department is carried on that a Sheffield mamufacturer of table Inives has actually received an order for hoes for this contract-an article which he does not make, but wll have to purchase from another manufacturer. One paragraph of your correspondent's letter, referring to the influence of trade combinations among the working classes, and causinm the fall of particular trades and dis. tricts, I fully agree would be a very valuable and important subject'for attention; and if he could point out the folly of such-attempts to restrict and curtail the developmnent of those trades ii which they exist to so great an extent as almost to drive away the trade, he would be doing great service to his ountry, but to write down the general trades of Â£hefEell in the style in which he has, done is not an occupation worthythe abilities of " A nmcus." In writing this short reply, I have stated what I know of my- own personal expetience, and hopDe iteili have some weight in disabusing the preJudices that -uld naturally arise after reading such alett7r as I refer to. _____I am, Sir, your most nhed ;;nt servant. . -b1iiUJkER10K THORPE MAPPINf lkTater en IP"ee' Vst'ery WVorks, RiieOd4, JA4 IZ - --
BRIZISH ACA2MFACTUBES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MS. Sir,-This letter wilv bring to a close all I have. at present to say about British manufactures and tho practices of British manufactuers. Tha discussion of our real position as a commercial and nanuacturing people, and of the relativeexcellences of our productions as compared with those of other countries,' has excited very general interest, and proved at least that Iwas neitherpremature nor ill-advised m directing public attention to the questiom. Indeed, even those who have differed from me in the opinions I hold and have ventured to express- willingly admit the importance of these occasional self-examinations, and the beneficial resuilts likely to follow from criticisms andadmonitions3 which are more efficacious, from their very severity, I when they arise from honest conviction and aI lively regard for the public welfare. But, Sir, it has been said, with perfect truth, that therevisno more sensitive sbject of RerBS-ijesty thanl the British manufacturer. He is full of tender points and trde mysteries; he cannot bear to be told evea of his failings and little weaknesses; is unwMlhin, to admit that the system by which he has himcelf aBvancedin lIfe, and bywhich he has seenhis country elijoy materialprosperity, can have any rottenness in one or several of its branches;'and is up in arms at once against any one who challenges his supremacy or dares to expose any of the customs of his trade. I was, therefore, well aware of the delicate nature of the groundIwas about to tread, and fuly expected a certain amount of 3msconception of meaning and misrepresentation of motive, but not, I confess, to the startling extent that I was umwilEng to admit a single excellence in any British produc tion,-that I had a secret pleasure in extoling the performances of foreigners-had not a crumb of comfort or praise to bestow upon the efforts of my own poor fellow-countrymen-and, in fact, -prophesied the immediate and inevitable downfall of the British nation. Such has been charged against me; but, hi truth, my observations and feelings were the very opposite of these. Nfo one can have a brigThter or more cheering conceptionthan myself of E ngland's future; for the very reasons that I have unbounded confidence in the sterlng worth, honesty, and honour of the national character, and a firm rehance in the existence among us still of that nerve, energy, and adventure which have built up our empire and our power. Very few will be found to contend that a conscientious belief in all these admirable qualities of character is at all incompatible with the further belief that there is very much that is false and wrong im our system which it behoves us at once to set about to reform. It was agaunst our shortcomings and dishonesties, which I believed to be increasing and threatening much mischief, that I endeavoured to raise my voice, and not aganst either general manufacturing industry, or the industries of whole districts; and in performingthis selfimposed duty I admit the use of the most severe and forcible language I possessed in order to give weight to my accusations, and plead guilty to having had no desire to feed or conciliate the prejudices of any -class by the adoption of honeyed words or insincere fLattery. But becatse I said rotten calicoes are'made in Manchester, bad wares in Sheffield, and infinite trash in Birmingham, I am therefore amenable to a charge of having asserted that nothing good whatever is producedin any one of those centres of manufacturing industry is, I conceive, a deduction both illogical and absurd. As well charge the philanthropist who talks of the fearful extent of crime, in London with branding all its inhabitants as burglars or thieves, or the writer who denounces that system of church govermuent which tolerates plura3ists and an infinity of sinecure offices with the opinion that every member of the profession, flom the hard-worked metropolitan to the haifstarved curate, feed daily upon the fat of the land. My warnings, I conceive, were of a limited and essentially practical character. 'What I saw in Paris induced me to thinkthat my own countrymen wanted rousing to a just appreciation of what other countrieswlvere about. I thought then, and think still, that the leading industrial nations of continental Europe had made such rapid advances in many important branches of manufacturing art that they were not only very likely soon to supply themselves with what England had been in the habit of supplying them with, but would begi to find exits for their productions, and bid against us in neutral markets. I noticed that the rapid development of the modern systems of intercommunication was sure to render important aid to the skill and enterprise of an active and quick-sighted people, and the reflection was forced upon me that, although England was peculiarly favoured in the arrangement and abundance of her natural productions, yet. she could boast of no title to the exclusivepossession of any one of these; while, at the same time, the progress of science was materially curktiling the. considerable advantages which her insular position had hitherto afforded her. I thought then, and think still, that we had not paid sufficient attention. or given sufflicient encouragement to the intimate connexion which must always exist, for their success, between the manufacturing and industrial arts of a country and the study and application of the severer sciences; and that the more rapid our improvement hadbeen themore closely we should have drawn this connexion, but had, unfortunately, neglected to do so. I thought then, and think still, that Englishmen had become overcontented with their own achievements, were- drunk- with their unparalleled eommercial prosperity during a long period of peace, and were not alive to the excellences of their neighbours, which they had been -long 'accustomed to sneer at and despise as "foreign" habits and " fore'gn" peculiarities. i My object in first addressing you was to make these impress:ons known, and to support my views with certain spacific facts, which warranted me in making them public. I am content that my general accuracy is confirmed by t,he opinions of the most competent authorities, and that, as regards the iron manufacture and steel wares especially, there exists abundant proof of our own recent want of progress, and a sufficiency of admirable examples produced by foreigners to stimulate our empl6yers and artisans to increased exertions and an honourable rivahy. But, in going one step further into my subject, another serious evil in our system was brought to light. The history of manufacture manifested in so many particulars a disregard of that main element of permanient success-c study of quaTitY in. tlte object producedl; it appeared so evident that by degrees in one branlch of manufacture after anlother the cheapening of the sale price had been demanded either by over-competition or over-production to an extent that rendered honesty of make or honesty of dealing inconsistent with the manufacturer's [or the tradesman's profit, that, as was remarked both in your leading columns and by myself, England had gained an unenviable notoriety as the-chief manufactory and depOt of every kind of counterfeit material, dishonest measure, and base trash. Now, Sir, no bne will more willing,ly than myself acknowledge the, incalculable blessings which have been conferred on mankind by the introduction and improvement of machinery, the ig,ht employment of capital, and the growth of manufactures. The benefits they have worked. are indeed incalculable, for they have clothed the naked, fed the hungry, and improved the happiuess of the whole world. Yet there are trades producing articles the very cheapness, of which stamps thein as not only worthless but mischievous,: and there are dishonesties, exercised both by manufacturers and tradesmen which are a disgrace to the present day and to our country. I will briefly refer to two or three of the more strking examples. Your correspondent, MWr. Wilson, gives an instance of " cheap" Sheffield goofis -si dozen knives and si2; dozen forks for 13s.- which few, I apprehend, 'will hesitate to consider worthless, or refuse to designate the manufacture as disgraceful and, in a comprehensive sense, unprofitable. As -a counterPat to such a marvel of economical production, I enclose -for your aceeptance a box of the choicest Birmingham jewelryI It consists, as you will observe, of 12 Pets of studs in diamonds, rubies, and pearls set in fine gold. Tha cost of the case to the' wholesnle purchaser is 4s6 9d. ! Fourpence three farthings the set of three magnificent pure-water diamond shirt studs! I Diamond rings and diamond and coral breastpins are similarly made and scll at 6s. the dozen, or 6d. each I And this tade, I am informed, keeps in existence several manufacturing houses or firms in Birmingham. Now, Sir, -in my humble judgment, no good or usefu purpoewwhateveris served by 'thiefostering of such a traae as this. It encourages the most vicious tass, and leads to the depozlinlElabitF nJcqf th i$ads oX these shm ornaments(.')*hich3n ustbey-earym to raise their manufacture to the importance c trade. Think of the- clases 'for whom tthey : designed, and to whom they must ultimately f their way-of. the early temptation to youthb eyes offered by these glittering impostures, then:i robbing of the master's till to satisfy the longii thus created, and the sbseqient career of diai ' tionandorune. Thisis y, confess,oneof i vimes occasioned by our run after cheapness at a cost. In other directions itItakes other forms C wouald suppose, for instance, that if you :bA5 givem measure of goods-or goods which profesu be those of a particular maker--you ought to be: sure of getting either one or the other as you. are obtaining five golden sovereigns for a B-n when you present it lat the Bank of Englat Listen, if you please, to a few facs forwhich J,a indebted to a friend who is, I pledge mysef, a mi reliable authority for every statement he has a vancedo. The respectable cotton manufaeturers w supply the Calcatta maiket- have for years be subjected to such fraudulent imitations of th trade marks or headings-such an infinity of utti worthless cloth has been. manufactured here a sent out under false pretences for sale abroad-tl they hve now found it necessary to stamp eic piece with their own names at full length, or sea} with their own private seaL. This proves that thq is a manufacture here, as I previously asserted, c ounterfeit and worthless calicoes or eloth, and. the same way the intimation by your correspond " C. J. S." (whose letter was very interesting me), that the most respectble of the Sheffi houses have been obliged to resort to similarp cautious, appears to me conclusively to prove all had asserted against that town's general reputati Again, when particular descriptions of clolith tamned the names of 7-8 or 9-8 cloths, it-~ fair to assume that at that time they F really what they professed to be-viz., 7-81 and 9-Bths of a yard wide respectively WI is the case now ? Not -only has the duability the manufacture here deteriorated by the conat. straining after cheaper 6bods; but first one dedi tion and then another has been made by the mak until the 7-8 cloth now measures only 27 inel wide, anda cloth which by its name professes to b yard and a-uarter is in truth barely a yard I f system of false measures and false quantities t tends, my friend informs me, to many other m'ar factured goods, such as tapes, bundles of which. stamped 9 yards, while they measure only 7 or and linen thread, which is sold by the pound, and -export is made np from 12 toI4 oz. to the pound. F'inally, I approach the practices in a snanufacti which affects every household in the land-.Qne Victoria, in Whndsor Palace, and the ennoblest p4 sauit woman in her cottage alhke use what is call "sawing-cotton." I invite them to test themselb wh3tIamnabouttostate. Themajorityof reels bobbins of thread profess to hold 300 yards-th( of the most respectable makers measure really aix 230 or 270 yards-which is a comparatively sm dehlecationflomtheirprofessions. But there eni. a reel wlhich circulates, owing to its apparc cheapness, much among the poor, is very ext sively shipped, and is known as the "Pais] reel." My friend has sent me five specimens of tl favourite reel, which, it appears, is not exclusinv manufactured at Paisley, but is rather the- nai adopted by most thread makers for a particu nmanufacture. No. 1,, "The British ]Exhibiti Thread," professes to be 100 yards-m6as: only G0. No. 2, marked " - Sons, -xh chester," Paisley quality, 300 yards-measures Ol 176. No. 3, green ticket, mnarked, " Paid Sewing Thread," 30 yards, and made at Paish measures only 150 yards. This appeared to; me coimfess, when I had got thus far, a strona enou deception for anything-to withold from {he hoa wife exactly one-half of what she supposed she u% buying. Butmy friend's memorandum stated "t above are for the home trade," and this led me suppose there was something worse behind. I pi ceeded with my inquiry, and it appeared tl specimens Nos. 4 and 5 were "for shippin_o onit No. 4 is labelled, on gold tickets, " Persiaftrthrei six cord ;, and " Warraznted 200 yarcls ,` the truth A measures 100 yards; and is only three cord. 3 last example, No. 5, is the " Royal British ThreaE ticketed 100 yards.

Nothing, in myopinio can justify such palpable deception; it is discou tenanced and reprehended by every respectal tradesman, and I trust to a general concurrence my assertion that every one who adopts it in pr. tice is, in truth, trading on false pretences. I commend the facts to the attention midazig feeling of the public, and believe that they on require to be known to excite that universal co demnation which will enforce a Epeedy remedy.

The Rgght Rev.Dr. Murphy, titularof Cloy has issued a short pastoral tothe laityunder spiritual jurisdiction, callng upon them fof t} assistance towards the foundation of a dioces seminary for the preparatory education of the yo aspiring to the ecclesiastical state. The object of course, quite proper and praiseworthy fcr a Thing that is kmown to the contrary. But MIurphy, asoneof thae few "tolerants"anongtheli prelates, travels ouat of his brief wvhen he resorts such lang,uage as follos in order to win the eals huis spiritual sulbjects:.- - "Ireland held at one timne a prominent positiona Chistian comtries for thne nsbe~r, variety, and rich dowmnents of her ecclesiastical institutious. Eer co'l and universities were open not only to her own child but received within their sacred precincts the stranger foreigner, who came in crowcds to obtain that mnowledg Ireland which had well nigh disappeared in the other co tries ofVEurope. The ample revenues of these instituti intended by their pious founders as well to maintain dignity of religion as to support thepoor of Christ diffuse the blesigs of education gratuitously among cas6es, were nevertheless seired on by the enemies of chureh, and what had been the patrimony of the c and the inheritance of the poor was applied to satisy cravings of individual cupidity, and some of our ti families may trace back the origin of their exalted positi to these sacrilegious coufiscations. The eclesiasEea'l scattered over the face of the country, mneeting-the 'wherever it turns, suffidently attest the work of despoiler, and present to our minds the sad history of country, vwritten in indelible characters.

The gold of lland, th e iLnM u of many of its nobility and gentry, the violent prejudic its benighted people, together wvith the undying hatred malevolence of the Protestanlt church in Ireland, are, arrayedagainstus. Were it not for the iterventon Providential circumstances, the storm of persecution lately raised by one of the professing liberal statenuen England, should, probably ere this, have burst over heads, and swept away in its destructive course every of that provision made by the Governent for the educati of the Catholic clergy of Ireland. -It becones, then, u imiRerative duty to avail ourselves of the resite from perse cution thus vouchsafed to us by a kind Providence, and render ourselves independent, as far as lies in our power, oe that provision. which rests on the mere sufferance of a e zem'es.O IHE MURDER OF _nXs EMMS.

Tuesday Evening The quotation of gold at Paris is about 4per le premium ( ording to the last tarifl, which, the English Mint price of St. IVs. lOl per o3. r. sndad gold, ives ana exchange of 2u5.27; and, ie czchange at Paris on London at short being .25, it followrs thAt gold is about 0.2 per cent. earer in London tJan nm P.Uis. By advices Ionl Hamburg the price of gold is .25 per mark, wraich, at the English Mint price of Z. 17s. 1Gd. perez. for standard gold, gives an ex.hange of 13.4k nd, the- exchange at Hamburg l11 Lonldon at hox* being 13.6, it follows that gold is0.SS per cent. dearer in London than m a The course of exchange at New York on London -r bils at (i days' sight is 1084 per cent., and, the the par of exchange between England and America Being 109 23-40 per cent., it follows that the eschange is nominaly 1.0S per cent. against England ; but, after making allowance for charges of ifrnsport and differeice of interest, the present rate Jleaves no profit on the transmission of gold either -way between the two countries. The English funds opened thiis morniing at a fur-ther improvenient of an eighth, and closed with great fimnness, noWithstanding a temporary rezetion. Consolsfor money, whichleftoff lastteveningat SWA to ,were first quoted S6t to t. From this they advanced to 86_k when some sales by the 'Government broker, as well as by speculators dis- xosed to look unfawournbly on the prospects of the money-market, caused a falJ to 86g. .From this, ~after a fe- fhlctulation, there was again a recovery -to 8Gq to i, whsich was the lat offcial price for -noney, the transactons for the accunt being at ~S6%to a. At a later hour a sttono disposition to -effect purchases was m.anifested, anA, without any -speci il reason being assigned fcr the movement, an aedvance took place to 8&@ for money, .an 86; toS7 for the accolunt. But for thle aipprehension of a possible increase in the rate of discoumt a niore -aecided advance woil d lhLve occurred in the early tart of the day. An angmenetation of the demand for money in the Stock-Exclhange likewise checked the dis tion to buoancy, short loans, which were yesterday offered at 5 pet cent., being in much re-quest to-day at that rate. Bank Stock was quoted -t the official close 200 to 208; Ilediced, 8G to ,j; New T1hree per Cents., 87 to 1 ; Long Annui1ies, 3 ; Annuities, 18, 1t; Exchequer-bohds, 9'; aid India-bonds and Exchequerbills, T7. to Is. discount. Foreign securities have not exhibited material variation, but quotations continue to be well supiported. In Turkish SiLX per Cents. the transactions for money were at SO;g and A, and for the ac,count at Sli, 80`, SI-m, and 803.. The Guaranteed X'our perCenit.

Certificates, the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was un advance in the rates upon P.ris, and quiotations ,generally exhiibited great firmness. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. -en the Paris Lourse this ev-ening were 62f. 40c. for -money anld 032f. 55c. for the end of the month, ~showng a ree.ction of an eightlh or a quarter per *cent. from the iniprovementof yesterday, and a proponderance of money sales. The commercial advices from New York this -week report no material alteration either in the stock or money markets. After the departure of ,the last packet prices had shown a tendency to depression, but there had been a partial recovery, andc the tone of business at the close of the year was considered favourable. ErieRailway was quoted 50W-; EReading, M2,; Panama, 103j; and Illinois Central Bonds, glk. The rates in the discount-mnarket still ranged between 9 and 12 per cent. for the best :aper; buat it was expected that after the first week in January there would be less pressure. Notwith:standing the demand for money, 'the State of New Tork had justraiseda5 per cent, loan of 850,000l.at 3ri premium ofÂ£rather more than 1 percent. It was for the pmrpose of paying off an expiring loan, and wVaS 'chiefy subscribed by the various banks. All the -tecounts of the results of the wsheat crop continued to support the original estimates of its extraordiny magnitude, and it was the belief of well-informed persons that the surplus for exportation ws bet-een -4,00o,000 and 5,000,000 quarters, the value of wrhich, at existing prices, wotuld be abouit 16,000,0001. sterling. Thle quantity still being sent to France -ns very large, and had produced a decided effect on the exchanges. The present steamner has brought mO specie, and from the quotations current at her departulre it does not scenm likely that any will rnve by the Pacific, wvhich may be expected in a -ay or two. About the mtiddle of the present innonti, however, the remittantces for the dividiends on the American Stocks held in Euro-ne generally caiuse some amiouint to be forwarded. According to the latest advices from Viucaragua, there -was nio doubt of Walker and his :party being able to maintain themselves. Notwith*tanding the proclamations of President Pierce, the -whole affair seemus to be regarded by the press and -the public as an American conquest, and Walk-er huad already received such reinforcements from Caiffornia and elsewhere as to be able to detach a number of^ nmen to the State of Honduras, wvith the view f assisting the Hondurenos inl making war on Gua-temaIa, this being avowedly a fi2rther step to the subjugation of all the Central A merican States. The annexed extracts from a mercantile letter -dated Montevideo, the 4th of December, give full details of the new revolution in that State brought -bout by the contrivances of Oribe. His return to Mlontevideo will doulbtless give fresh courage to the partisans of Rosas at Bnenos Ayres, and the event is calculated generally to damip all hopes of progress in the River Plate:- W hen I said that before3larebl next we might have two -or three more revolutions I was not far wrong. By revolu-tions I mean, of course, those armed disturbances which the natives here term such. One of these came offa few days -zV, and there can be little doubt the chief cause and pro-moter of it was the notorious Onrbe, whose return from :Spain has been so soon followed by bloodshed; and he will, eIeve, not be satisfied until lie has decimtated the papulation. He threw his wiles over Flores, whio is nor most ,completely led by this arch-promoter of anarchy; and, -aIthough these A-rcdes, it is said, have entered into a league -to procure the election of Don Manuel B. Bustamente as Presidert for the en-suing four years from aMarch next, -an opinion very generally prevails that Oribe will rove false as hereto'ore, and promote his owvn election. Should this oceur, it is believed it wmill not be long before Rosas resppea-s in the River, and then war on both sides aill ifeevitaB)ly foUow. Email and Urquiza wil again unite to expel these common disturbers, and these fine countries may ba -desolated for years. In conseuernce of the league between 'Onbe ana Flores, and the reports sent about by them as to -the intentions of the Colorados, which I believe had no -foundation in fact, they persuaded the imert Bustamente to place a large military force in the ca,iWo under the com. muand of Flores. Oribe in the tmeantime organized the Guards Nacional in Union-that force which, it wiiU be recollected, was the cause of the July revolution, -which terminated in the elevation of Flores, although he -as then opposed to the Blancos. These proceedings caused great alam to Munoz and other Conservadores, and they ilew to arms-just the thing, no doubt, that their enemies hoped. Mluoz took possession of the Government build-ius, the fort San Jose, Hoccuard's Azotea, and one or two -others *f equal prominence an the vicinity. He bud about '26mue. (poa this Flores,with a force four times^as large, advanced through the Calle de Xisiones, took possession of the seiraedes in commtanditg positions, and -opened fire. Tey wvere blazing away at each other from the -morning of the '2Sthi nIt, early until night, wshen the frirno -cesed. Some 30 mnen were killed, and aboult 6i irounded.

Nl,e have hea,rd of the arr.i,74, of some 20D there, but. many people Are leaving this for the other .aide of the.river. The presence of Oribe, with increasi1ia iafluence, is creating a feeling that this country is stil d&s -tinedto he thetheatre of unceaEngbloodshed. Basines, of corse, is paralyzed. We are about forming x' Foreign AssOciation,' to which aJl foreigners Mil be admitted on aying a monthly subscription. Niewspapers will be provided, and a es.vings-sakeatablished.

"The news of the suspension of the respected firm of De Lisle, Janyrin, antd C:o., in London, reached us by last packet. It w-s received with surprise, and deep regret. )e Lise Brothers aiid Co. here and at Buenos Ayres are mach respected. It is gratifying to learn, however, that they wa-l be ready to met any bils that mLy be- returned for non-payment by the London finu, who, I understand, acted merely as agents. Theyexpect, however, that arran nients will have been mace m London to honour all the bhls drnwn on DeLisle, Janvrin, and Co. e 'From Buenos Ayres there is no news worth relating. The Indians continue their depredations, and the Guachos appear umwilling to take the field against thet. Amny fainilies in the south have been brought to a state of abso. lutc miseg,; and the Government shows a want of enercy that is highly culpable. It is srid Brazil and urouiza hlav entered mto a treaty to war aainst Paragay. This is apity,as that country has been sparedthe horrors of warfor some S0 or 40 years. Business is in a wiretched state." It is rtunoured that the new act now in preparation byGovernment for the incorporation and regaL-ation of joint-stock companies contains a clause which 'will increase, by defining, the responsibilities of directors. It is said to declare that erey director shall be held to be acquainteda withalithe acts of the board, and also that every director shall be responsible for the truth of the statements which they put forth. If they saythat a railway has made a profit, or that a bank has assets to meet its engagements, they are to be held responsible to all parties interested for the truth of *what they thus publish. T"he wveekly review;s from the Aserdam andPotterdam produce-mtrkets state that businmess having beenlimited there was little alteration in prices. The principal operations had been mn rico and indigo, for which there M as an increased demand. . In sugar and coffee the tranactions were comparatively nominal. The letters from Rouxen mention that the attendance of purchasers was more nurmerous, and that some descriptions of manufa.ctures brought rather Iigher rates. According to a, Government return, just obtained, with regard to foreign hops, the quantities imported iii the year eniding MIidsmmmer, 1853, were 1,333cvwt,; in 1854, 54,85cwt.; and in 1855, 1llO,OOOcw.

STA2T OF TRADE. There has not been much general b s but longcloths and T-cloths have taken the demand better for some days past, and there have been considerable purchases at ful prices. The accounts from India aro regarded generally as rather unfavourable. and for India sEirtings and madapollamrs there has been a limited demand, but in somne degree this results from the firm adherence to prices of manufactures, who are mostlystill nnderfengagements for future delivery, and somne of whom report that they could have obtained rather la-ge orders fordeliver- in March and April at a slight concession in prices, a fact which is regarded as an indication that there is no great anticipation of anyconsiderablereduction inpricesfor some aontls forward, notwithstanding the general caution observed amon" buyers. The tendency of the cloth-market, however, Wit% some exceptions, is regarded as dow nwards. In yarns the market is flat, and prices arie agai rather easier; Very little busiress has been done for Iudi;a but there are still some f.ir purchases for the Italian States. Buyers represent almost aUl counts of yam for home manufacturng purposes as about -d. per lb. easier to buy. For Germlany nio mg doing. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report of the cloth-market.- " Since Tuesday Last there has been a very active demand -for the better qualities of Ion-cloths and T-eloths, and a large business has been done at full prices. For nearly all other sorts the demand is langid, and prices tending dow wards; as, owing to the declinng cotton-market, the tightness of nmoney, and the unfavourable accounts to hand from India, bayers keep aloof from the market as ruec as possible, and any offes made for quantity are from I'd. to 3d. less than our quotations." Mess. Fraser, Son, and Co., say- "There is no change inour market to-day. It continues dull, and wvhere any little difference of prices exists it is in favour of buyers, who, however, are not munch -disposed to operate."

The debenture and other interest charges against the halfyear amount to 58,2311., the canal amnuities to 13,7341., the dividend on the ol. preference shares to 23,662&., . and the dividend on the 101. preference shares to 20,160.-nmakingA total charge of 121, 788 as aminst the above net baltnce of 139,162?., and leaving 17,37X1. Available. ConsideriAg the greatscarcityandthe ighpriceofmroneyduringthehalf-year it will be satisfactory to the shareholrkers to iearn that the company's debenitures have beenrenewred, upon the whole, on very satisfactory terms, and, as the directors believe, at rates lower than those submitted to by sorae larger companiea in other portions of the kingdonm The directors will recommend to the proprietors to pay a dividend ot5s. per 1001. on the ordinary stock of the company, or at the rate of half per cent. per annun, and to carry forward a balance of 7,638!. The net revenue of the first half of the year has been invariably less than that of the second half, and bearing in rmind this fact, together with the additional preference chlarge accraing in the next half-year of 5,958l. on the new 31 per cent. stoc,l the divldend upoxi wiich commenced on, the Ist inst., the directors consider it a measure of prudence to carry forward a large balance in order to meet any inequality in the net reacipte of the two Ihalf-years which may not be met 'by increase of traffic or reduction in the percentage rate of expenditure. The company's traffic receipts were injurionsly affected by ,he stoppa;e of the main line for 14 days, through the fallangmnx or t?e Thurgoland tunnel, and to this, among other cases, must be attributed the very small increase of traffic actnally carried which the half-year's working has presented. The corresponding half-yeas traffic however, wuas slightly augmented bysome iens of credit in settlement thlrou"h the Cleating-house previously ots-tandi'ng, and therel'ore the present half-year's aecoruns exhibits an apparent decrease of 308?. 'on rnitrayaccoqmt. A decrease of 4,9091. appears on' the passenger traffic sccosst 1,8451. on the pareels, Ae., account, .andb64don the live stecekacconlat - whbile there has been en actual increase of 4,190h :-n connexion withthe goods traffic, and of 2,8204 ir connexion with the mneraltrafac. During thehalf-yearthesatsupon uany descriptions of traic have bcen raised to t moderate extent, and the directors are happy to state that the propriety of the increase which has been umaed ls, been, generally speaking, adamitted by the pardes, sendaug traffic along the railway. 5Te continzance of the war has been of very seriouss detriment to the interests of the company, by restrictingthe export andd import of Baltic and other produce, and generally. The fecal receipts of the company have b1ee 606621. foe tho conveyance of passengers of al classes, as against 6T,690L in the corresponding half of 1854. A decrease of 7T0281 has thereforetakenplace. The foreign receiptshave'been 15,IGX)., as against 13,4411. in thecorresponding half of 1854, showing an increase of 2,119?., or a net decrease on the local and foreign of 4,900?. One lrge item of receipts upon the company's railways eo,gists of building materials. This traffic hasbeen very cuesiderably affeicted bythe deficient trade and the tioclide of the Baltic. The number of houses in courseof crection in Manchester and SaLford in 1852 was 1,043, and in 185; 248; in Sheffield, 982 in 1852, and 989 in 1855; in Lincoln, 137 in 1852, and 30 in 185. The directors are hapT to announce that the formation of the Anglo-French bteamship Company is prog-ressing stisfactorily, notwithstanding the depression of the times. The directors and officers of the comp.ny havo taken a considerable share in the capia of this new company, with a view to 'develope the resources of Grimsby, and they look in return or tho-earnest co-operation of thepropretors, and for their entire support in carrying out all such, mneasares as are necessar for increasing the steam tonnage applicable to the port of rimsby. The receipts of the canals, after deductaug amounts received on trarffc settlements, show n deficit of 4,008?. as compared with the corresponding half-year of 1854. This arises in a great measure from thesmiall amount of building in operation, and the falling off in the gnitstone trade, very few roads being under construction in the Manchester district. The working expenses show that a diminution of 8,055l. has taken place in the rail-way expenses ofthishalf-year, as comparedwith the corresponding half of 1854, and- of 1M,0O1M as compared w ith the last half-year. As regards the expenditure ainthe locomotive departnent, there as been a diminution of 1,072. as compared w ith the correspondin- half of 1854, and of 7,252!., as comparedwith the previousalf-years.Notwithstandin- this, there airs of thecompany'sworkingslock havebeen frlyat. tendee to. The trafficexpenses showa diminution of 919g., as compared withVthe corresponding half ofj1854, andof 3,4191., as compared w.th the last half-year. In the maintenance of way and stations there is a diminution of 2,9nW. as coinm pared with the corresponding half-year of 1854, and of 3,836?. as com wired with the last half-year. Daring the half-year a sage amount of fishing and somue relaying of rails has been carried out by the contractor. The Thargoland tunmel has been substantially repaired, anid is now in a Very satisfactery state. The espenses of the various canals have been reduced dauing the half-year to the extent of 2,5441., ' as comapared with the corresponding period of 1854. The capital account shows an increaseo 74,978., principallyfor works sanctioned at the date of. the last half-yearly rmeeting, and inchides a sum of 25,009?. paid in settlement of a claim long pending between the company and the contractors for GriL-q ay Docks. The Barnsley branch extension was orened to the west side of thetowvnof BarusleyontheLttof Novemberlast. The works on the remaaining portion of the line are in progress. The company's claim upon the Post-office has been settled. The directors are happy to report that they ,ill have no bill in Parliament for the ensuing session. The 'company's relations with surrounding -companies remain on the whole of a very satisfactory character. The arrcars of dividend on the No. 1 quarter-shares, amounting to 01,4981., have been already capitalized, in. accordance with the at' of last session, and the coupons of 3} per cent. stock have been issued to the, proprietors of those shares. The arrears upon the 10f. sares, amounting on the IstinsL to 31.-10gs. per share, will be capitalized immediately after the mneetingto beheld on the 23d inst., maldng ani increase of3oS,200c., or a total capitalbearing dividend at 3j per cent. of 366,49. Inconclusion, the directors congratulatetaeeproprietors upon the facts that the net balance avaiLable for interestauddivideud is the largest whichhasbeenyet received, anudthat the generalt state of the comopany'saflblrsissatisfactor,y. The company's share of traffic under the agtreemlent with the London and North-Western Company increases on and after the Ist of Jny next. The capital account to the 31st of December last shows that8,403,2837. had been receired, and $,402;9492? expended, leaving a balance of 5,3451. The consolidated stack of the company amounts to 3,893,7681., leavin- 4,514,5191 entitled to preference interest or diidena, including 2,582,548I. orn debentures. Therevenue account for the ha'lf-year ending the 31st of December lastsho,Ns3 that the total receipts amounted to 278,231., including an award of 7,6001. for conveyance of mails between Now-Rollard and null, and' 335,617!. from the company's foinr caifals The expenditure on working the railway amounted to 120,305a., or 53'62 per cent. of the receipts for the half-year, and on the canals to 19,4601., or 5146'per cent. ofthe receipts, mxlin- together 139,7651O, and leaving a balance of .138,473T. for interest and 7dividend.

- LOYDOR, WDfVESDAY, JA2TARY16, 18. In another fortnight ,Parliament will meet, after i recess crowded with momentous incidents. It wi be the lot of the Legislature to discuss the past and. future camnpaigns, to examine the causes of tuccess or fai-re, to suggest rewards for eminent ervices, or to demand inquiry into alleged neglects. la i1! sircunztauce we vr no longer delay mention of a subject which occupies the minds of those conversant with Eastern affairs. We have, before alluded to the transactions connected -with the siege of Kars, andl to the comun-enUtuM9 on the conduct of Lord. STnArronz ns,Rzn z, the British Ambasador at Constantinople. The great salanity which has befallen the Turkish arm hs given to these events a vast inportance, and we abovid but ill perform our duty if we conealed the heat theneglct id sbandonmet of theM"oh officers and the troops they so ably led are spoken of and are attributed by persons ,wel informed on the matter to personal feeling on the part of the Amdbassador towards the English General whose name is now so well kInonL in connexion with a long defence of the place. The matter is notorious to all acquainted with the Turlish capital, and not entirely unknown to the world in general, although the formalities of political discussion have generaUy precluded any allusion to it in Parliament or the press. It may be said, then, that it is the misfortune of Lord STrortOn to live in a state of dissensien with almost every man with whom he is brought into contact. 41though his age and position are sufficient to insure due respect, and those who approach him have no wish to be on other than amicable terms, yet few can hope long to escape some outbreak of his violent and groundless illwill. He lives in an atmosphere of antipathies, and, accustomed during so many years to intercourse with Tiurkish officials and to the deference of Levantino society, he is impatient of any demur to what he conceives his authority. The disregard of his advice, or even the differing from his opinion, is enouigh to kindle a dislike which may last for years. Such is the man to whom the British Government has committed the care of its interests in the East. Turkish ways are not as our ways, and a Minister at home must naturaUy leave all dealings with this nknolwn world to the representative and his staff of Orientalists and dragomans. A British Ambassador can by a word enforce attention to a request of his Government, or mark it ouit for neglect. 4' I " am to lay this communicationbefore you-do not "a sk my opinion of it, decide for yourselves," is sufficient to insure the rejection or evasion of a demand, even though it emanated from the Foreignoffice itself, for the PORTE w<il fancy tllat it was never meant to be acceded to, and will, with ready duplicity, acquiesce in the stratagem. Hence it is evident that the whole power of the country he represents must be wielded personally by a representative in the East. Now, the statements to which we wish to call attention are a&s follows :-General WInAwes, who had been formerly employed on the Turco-Persian Boundary Comniissioui, and had some acquaintance vith the people and langPnage of Asiatic Turkey, was in 1854 selected as British Commissioner to the Ottoman army in Armenia. The Turks had been defeated in five battles, and their force was completely disorganized. It was thought that the experience of General WnxVsrLis might be of service in the reconstitution of the army and the defence of the threatenied provinces. He was distinguished chiefly by a quiet, unassuming disposition, so nmuch so that few of his friends gave him credit for the resolution and sternness which he displayed in the defence and government of Kars. It is difficult, therefore, to coxceive the grounds of the Ambassador's alleged dislike, except it be that General WITLrAIMS received bis appointment fiom the Foreign-office, and not through the representations of Lord STRATFORD. But this dislike seems to have been not only felt, but expressed ; the Ambassador is said to have, in his usual manner, proclaimed his resentment and his purposed retaliation. One tling is clear-that he would in no way assist the new British Commissioner, even in the most formal manner. General Wmtwirs had to go up to the seat of war unrecommended and unaccredited by the representative of his country. With men lie the Turldsh commanders this was a sufficient hint, and the General's difficulties were no doubt vastly increased. However, he applied himself to his task, took note of deficiencies, saw how corruption and cowardice had wvorked, and was soon intent on a thorough reform. His official position was strictly only that of an adviser; he could do nothing but by the Turkish Government, and his only instrument must be the representations of the Ambassador. He according,ly wrote to Lord STRATFORD, entreating his assistance in laying before the PoRTE the impending danger and the necessity of action. The fact which wve shall now state is almost incredible, but we believe that it is true beyond a doubt. The Ambassador would hold no communication awith General WILLIdMS. He would not answer, he would not acknowledge the receipt, of a single despatch. It is said that not less than 63 despatches and letters were sent by the British Commissioner, and to not one of these would the Ambassador reply. He would have nothing to do with General WILLrTEs or his affairs Among the raost pressing wants was that of anununition. General WrI.rLiws -wrote, it is said, repeatedly on this subject, but received no answer, and nothing -was done. When Kas surrendered there was only tlhree days' ammunition in the place, although it had to sustain no regular siege. This fact was successfully concealed from the Russians, or it might have saved them a long and wearisomae blockade. At last, we believe, General NVILTAMS made a complaint to the Foreign-office, which in turn directed Lord STR'TFoRD?s attention to the matter, and requested him no longer to neglect the representations of the Commissioner. Lord STRA.TORD UngraciOUSly obeyed, corresponded formally with General WiLmAs, but the requests of the latter were to the last ineffectual. General Wiurass, making the best of his narrow means, fortified the two chief cities of Armenia, and took his stand at Kars, the frontier fortress of the province. Men, provisions, ammunition, were alike deficient,-the troips were in a miserable condition. One of the matters urged on the Ambassador by General WsrAs was a payment, at least in part, of the arrears due to them. Those in Kars had not received a piaster for three years when the place fell, and their clothes were worn out long before their stomachs were pinched. The request, it is needless to say, was umoticed by Lord STpATroRsi. The men were much cast down and discontented as far as it is in the nature of the Mussulman to be. But when 3Mo0uvrvanF surrounded the place the energies of both Englishmen and Turks were roused. Neglected, insulted, abandoned, General Wuz,tlis determined to resist to the last. His officers stanchiy stood by himn. That these brave men should feel xo pang of resentment towards him whose causeless animosity they believe to have been their ruin, would be perhaps more than can be hoped from human nature. If anything, however, could add to their indignation, it would be to find that after the place was invested, after the de- fence had begun to enlist the sympathies and rouse the admiration of the world, the Ambassador suddenly changed his tone, gave an air of cordiality to his despatches, expressed his oommiseration for the unfortnate General and his Staff, and talked of his constant exertions for their safety ! But 'we have said enoug-h. An inquiry into these things must take place at an early day. The correspondence since the autumn of 1854 will; no doubt, -be called for. For the present we leave the matter, in the full hope that justice will be donie.
The letters of "Axcus" have elicited the extraordilnary fact that there is .a M AsTER '~ C'vniRt"at Sheffield. That there is 'sachi a name is probably known to most people who have got as far as the British IWles in their geographical .latudies. But' the "MSTEP CuTL" of Sheffield is, it appears, sometiing more than a magni wi*inis umira. He bes a "-postion;," and it in one that compels him to appear h the cutlery of his town is called in 9vW stion. He has visited not only the Paris F;chibition, but the cutlery ianufactories Of -He United States, France, Belgiua-, andBuP-:ia. - Ee knows-the respective ckaracters of 'jhe different firms in his town, the good makers, the bad marks; the sterling articles, the counterfeits; the true marks, and the forgeries. He has had his eye on.the Government contracts, and knows the cheap rubbish palmed off on the War Department. He kmnows how unprincipled ontractors undertake what they are themselves unable to supply, and where they go to for the miserable articles that will pass official muster. In fact, he knows all about it, and his knowledge enables him to give a very bad account of the state of things in his town. More than that, it enables him to be discriminate and exact. He is not overwhelmed by the universality of the evil He has not that morbid surpicion of all Sheffield goods which he ascribes to "1 AroCs." '-No; he knows 'bwich is wvhich, and who is who. IHe is a living touchstone of wares- and of characters.- He can tell instantly, by signs unknown to tlaw uninitiated, the moral temper of a manufacturer, the hardness of his principle, the edge of his conscience. What a man is this DIooExEs of hardwares ! I-Vs' the very man we -all want everywhere, and for all purposes. Would that we had such a man to select .our Ministers, our Generals, our Admirals, our Bishops, our Representatives,-in fact, all our political, military, naval, eeclesiastial cut-andhacL-ems ! In sorry truth, it is not only in files, saws, and edged-tools that we -want strength, elasticity, toughness, hardness, or lkeenness, as the case may be. How often do we see a blunt fellow where we want a sharp one, and a marvel of pliancy where there ought to be no bending ! How plagued the nation is with living instruments that pass for Field Mlarslhals, Staff officers, and high functionaries in Church and State, just by virtue of a name, a stamp, a few letters, that after all are arrant forgeries.! Oh for a "M1 MtsTr CUTERan to ascertain the true worth of the "Lord," or " Right Bon.," or " Right Rev.," or " General," or " Admiral," just stuck to a mau's name ! Sheffield and its hardwares are the only place and the only articles that have this infallible MiLos. A thousand thanks to " Amcugs" for the discovery of this personage. Then, " MtsTER, CuTrrn," art thou without excuse. Why do you appear simply to puff the manufactures lvhich you are created to defend, not from criticism, but from deterioration ? lVhy run out into the street like the fond father, who only shows his parental instinct in resenting the chastisement of his misbehaving children? For the present we need not discuss the wide question what a "MAsTER CuTTER" can do to protect trade marks from piracy, and the name of Sheffield from being clishonoured all over the world, for, happily, the " MAsrTR CUTLER. " has reduced the issue before us to one class of articles, one cuKtomer, one establislunent, and one series of transactions. It happens, too, to be an instance particularly interesting just now, and the " SrTEP. CurmEV" is quite as warm about it as we are, or as " A-nrcues" could be. In this instance, then, is the "M1AsTER CoiERs of Sheffield utterly at variance with " AICus ?" Does he floor "Asrus" with his overwhelmin.g authority and undeniable proofs? No such thing. He overwhelms " A_iceS" with a superfluity of corroborative evidence. He undertakes to enlighten our correspondent by showing to him that the state of things is even worse than any stranger to Sheffield could possibly have anticipated. He tells us, with an authority which the public press, the QUEEN, Lords, Commons, and the Church and all tlu iuztitultiOlIs of tlle coumtry would not venture to impugn, that the hardwares supplied by Sheffield to the WVar Department, and as necessary to the slucess of military operations as powvder, shot, and shell-viz., knives and forks, gabion knives, farriers' knives, butchers' knives, &o.,-are of the very commonest quality that can possibly be produced. Indeed, it is a mystery to the "M Msrm. CurLER" how our poor soldiers manage to cut their salt pork, or to cut wood for gabions. in fact, the health and strength of the British army, and its power of defending itself against the shot of the enemy, are deliberately sacrificed to the dishonest cupidity of Sheffield manufacturers. Had " A_cus!' said as much,-had he denounced Sheffield as the enemy of the country, playing into the hands of Russia for the sake of a wretched percentage,-then we might indeed expect all Sheffield to rise as one man to repel the foul charge. But it is no enemy that has done this. It ig Sheffield's manufacturers' own familiar friend, their dear "I STER, CuTLER." But why defer these invaluable revelations til they are too late-till the contract for 1856 is actually taken, and the tools with which our brave soldiers will have to do half the work of the war in this next critical campaign are already in the hands of manufacturers certain to " scamp" their workl ? Why hold your tongue, " MAsTn CuTnm," when you could have spoken to some purpose and saved our gallant army from unknown disasters, a7nd only open your mouth to cry out against the " severity "and injustice," "the mis-statements and exaggera" tions," the "prejudices" andwant of patriotism of the manwho is only doingyourownwork? "11AWsTR, "CUTLER ," you do your duties in a very dog7-in-themanger fashion; you neither denounce the bad worlmanship of Sheffield yourself, nor suffer others to denounce it, even when you are forced to acknowledge that the charge is too true. For our own part, we may reasonably complain that all this unpleasantness is thrown upon the press, when there are " MASTER CUTLxis created, and honoured, and paid, for augght we know, for the very purpose of.guiding the British public and the British Government in the choice of good Sheffield wares. Were the "MIrsTER "CurrER" of that town to proclaim that the edged-tools furnished to the War Department would infallibly lose their edge as soon as the poor soldier attempted to cut his pork for his dinner or a gabion for his life, we can hardly imagine any powers of official corruption prevailing against him. Why did he not say all this before ? Already he is a sufferer for honesty's sake. "No maanufacturer," he says, " who makes good "articles has any chance of ever obtaining a "Government contract for cutlery." His own firm has repeatedly sent in tenders for cutlery to the War Department. The last one it actually priced at cost, but never yet has it been successfuL This is a very sad ase-not for you, Mr. MAPiN, in particular, for you are "'MASva CC C ,TL=)" a man of consideration; a good manufacturer and successful tradesman-but sad for us, for the poor soldiers in the Crimea, for your country, and for all the great interests at stake in this dreadful war. 'But take our advice, " 3WTEsR "CuLER"-maake a virtue of necessity. Give upall idea of Governmert contracts. You are a world too good for such dirty work. But, having fortified yourself with this self-denying oidiaan6b, set your face like a fliit-we beg your pardon, like steel-against theme rogueries-agaiust frauduIent contractors-against the Hon. Spoonies of the War Department-against the whole system which, as much as anything else, has lost us one army, and even now jeopardizes another. Spare us a little of this'invidioujand most irlsome work. Why must our correspondent in the Crim be thrue into a position which the " 14trm Curm ` of Shefweld begins his letter by dAiming M lis own -How about thfoe took now maldng for our imarmy A Depend. on it, " 1ASTEh CuTLmg," youll' never' get another contract. . ure down double black in the books eti I the War Department, and all the other departments. .

Amid the late corn panic certain orators attempted to inflame the populace by aniiouncing the fact that large quantities of grain had been cast into the Thames in order to raise the prices anld the profits of the corn merchants. The deed was so extravagantly- wicked, and the story so extravagantly absurd, that the only feeling with which a nman of sense could hear it was pity for the poor dupes who were led away by such miserable romancing. And yet the story is substantialy truethe crime is actually committed. Is there any real difference betvween destroying some hundred quarters of wheat, after it has been grown and gathered, by casting it into the mud of the Thames, and preventing the same measure from springing up, because it has been cast upon undrained and therefore sterile mud ? Betveen the burning of a stackyard or a granairy and the rendering a field fruitless there is no difference, save in the penalties lwhich attarh to these misdeeds; and that the latter offence is frequently committed must be evident to any one who considers the quantity of waste laud throughout the country, and not merely of waste land, but also of half-cultivated soil. In the eleven English counties alone which furnished agricultural returns in the year before last there are no less than 163,000 acres of waste land attached tothe farms, besides about 800,000 acres not accounted for. Add to all this waste the immense quantity of under-cultivated land-soil not properly drained-not properly manured-not properly cropped, and it must be evident that England could easily produce a vast deal more grain than she now does, and convert -what are at present exceptionally fine harvests into ordinary ones. That the farmers are in many disticts as inert and heavy as the clay of their far.ns, and opposed to all those modern improvenients which would double their profits, is a fact too common to excite any wonder, but, we are certainly surprised to hear of an enterprising member of this class being systematically thwarted in his endeavour to improve his farm. That surprise, however, is lessened when we discover that the obstruction is caused by the Dean and Chapter of Windsor, onr recent experience of corporate bodies of this kind reflecting no great credit on their management. It appears that a correspondent, whose letter will be found in another part of oiur impression, is the lessee of a large farm of theirs in Oxfordshire, which might be made very productive, but which is now ahuost a waste, the tenant being unable to improve it from its want of draining. In conformity wvith recent legislation, he was anxious to obtain a Govermnent loan to drain it, buit cannot participate in that benefit from the objections raised by the owners, who, if we may credit our correspondent, " not only set their faces against parish " improvements to which they miay be asked to " contribute, but are such enemies to innovation " that they refuse to assist their tenants in iin"proving their farms, and will not even give them "the opportunity of doing so at their own cost." We regret exceedingly that, since the principle of association and corporate action is becoming more and more general in every great undertaking, it should be continually brought into discredit by instances of this kind, in which the result of the system seems to be the wilful neglect and irresponsible rule of the managmig parties-the waste and confusion of the property managed. That the Dean and Chapter of Windsor should stand in the way of agiicultural progress and prevent their tenant from doubling the production of his farm is peculiarly odious. Time was -when the church lands were the best cultivated in the kingdom, and the ecwlesiastics taught their lay brethren to farm. Beeause this was good Catholicism, shall it now be good Protestantism to do the very contrary ? The Dean and Chapter probably are acquainted with a parable which we commend to the consideration of all who are content with the old style of farning. It is that of a man who hid his talent in the ground from year to year, and -while his neighbours doubled theirs neglected to get even common interest for his. It was taken away from him, and he was cast out of the kingdom. It is scarcely possible to set a limit to the quantity of corn which the country is capable of producing, and we do not think the expectation chimerical that, with an improved system, we might soon be nearly independent of foreign supplies. In the agricultural statistics to which we have already referred it is calculated, from the eleven English counties which furnished returns, that there are about 800,000 acres of waste land in England and AVales; and, as there are besides nearly 4,000,000 not accounted for, the quantity must be considerably over a milion. Were these and the other lands properly cultivated, how far would they go to make us independent of foreign grain? We are disposed to think that the later calculations of our growth of corn, Mr. CAu&D' especialy, are not, after all, very wide of the mark, and that in wheat, for example, our dependence on foreign supplies is not much greater than is generally supposed. But this view may be wrong, and we must again point out the necessity of procuring more accurate returns. It would be difficult to mention the number of estimates which have been made of the annual production of wheat in this country, and the remarkable differences which exist in these estimates. One method of ascertaining the crop is by calculating the consumption of each _individual, by subtracting from the quantity consuimed the quantity imported, and adding to it the grain required for seed. In this way Mr. CAiuD, starting from- the supposition that the total annual consumption of Great Britain and Ireland is 18,000,000 quarters, has calculated that the total average wheat crop of England is 11,500,000 quarters. There is no man whose opinion in these matters is more entitled to deference than 3Ir. CARn, and the estimates of the production of cereals which he has from time to time published in our columns make a nearer approach to accuracy, we believe, than any other ones. We. shall presently point out the peculiar merit of his calculation, and how, by means of it, we have helped to allay a panic which the Government by statistical returns, and not we by our private efforts, should have moderated. But it must be evident that many elements of uncertainty enter into the mode of reckoning by consumption. - low many bushels per head shall be fixed upon ?-that is 'the first question. Shial it be five or eight-less or more? - And what proportion of the populationX shall we estimate as wheat-con- sumers? Shall we say, with Mr. CAiR, every individual in England and every second idividual in ' Ireland' and Sootland ? Then the amount of grain appropriated to seed-that must .deiend upon the' acreage appropriated ^ to vwheat, and here is another element of uncertainty., Out of all this we airive at an- estinate which certainly seems to require coiifirmation. I The statists, however, usually conive to make the calculation by this roundabout method tally with the more direct principle ' of weasurement, which attempts to ascertain the number of acres allotted -tiroughout the country to the production of whext, and the average number of b'aels ' which these acres affor. Now, ere ag,Ain a doubt arises. We have praised :the estijnates of our late commitsioner, but, while they have been suibstantially correct and of immense service to the country, it is obviotus that the merits ' of any private enterprise of this kind must not encourage the Govermment to neglect 'the duty of providing official returns; and it is necessary 'to state explicitly wherein the value of the returms published by us consists. The wheat acreage of England is stated differently by different individuals. By some authorities the return is based on enumerations made thirty years ago; and the estimate of MIr. CmD, as the latest, one of the lowest, and carefullest, wae accept as the truest. Still it may, for aught we know, be wide of the mark; and the fact is that, whatever value attaehes to it as an exponent of the actual production of wheat, the peculiar value of his calculation is in giving the best attainable estimate of its comparative production. Given the average of wheat acreage as a constant quantity,-the proportion, less ormore, devoted to that crop in a particular year and the yield wper acre,-these are the im- I portant points to decide upon-these are the I chances that agitate the market-these are the estimates whivch Mr. CAiRD has made with wonderful correctness, and which have very much contributed to stop the panic with which we were threatened. It is a satisfaction to us that by the timely publication of such matter we have done somewhat to aleviate the condition of the working-classes, who are enduring so manfully the burdens of the war; but we trust that before next harvest comes the Board of Trade will relieve us of this duty, and supply the coiutry with returns vhich can be received as oracular.
TUB UXITED STABsE. (FROM OIM OWN COkP RP?VT'k-P I NEWIr YORK: JANr. L Congress havilng failed to organize itself dluring the montlh of December, thePresident yesterday sent his mzessage in to both Hou ses, in order that it might go out to Europe by the Bostonl steamer. The relations ith Great Britain occupy the mostpromi- nent place, chiefest of which is the construction of the Central American convention of 1850, known as the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The United States, he says, construe the agreement neither to "occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise dominion over Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mlosquito Coast, or any part of Central America," to be an abandonment of the British claim to a protectorate over the Mosquito Indians, or to any British colonies or settlemnents, except those in the Belize. Great Britain claims that the agreement was prospective, and was not intended to operate upon colonies already established or territory already acquired, b3ut still "declares that it sees no reason why a conciliatory spirit may not enable the two Governmenlts to overcome nll obstacles to a satisfactory adjustment. of the subject." To this overture the President replies,- " Assured of the correctness of the construction of the treaty constantly adhered to by this Goverimnent, and resolved to insist on the rights of the United States, yet actuated also by the same desire which is avowed by the British Goverrunent to remove all causes of serious risunderstanding between two nations associated by so many ties of interest and kindred, it has appeared to me proper not to consider an amicable solution of the controversy hopeless. *-There is, however, reason to apprehend that, with Great Brtain in the actual occupation of the disputed territories, and the treaty therefore practicaUy null so far as regards our rights, this itternational difficulty cannot long remain undetermined wvithout involving in serinos danger the friendly relations which it is the interest as well as the duty of both countries to cherish and preserve. It vill afford mae sincere gratification if future efforts shall result in the success anticipated heretofore with more confidence than the aspect of the case permnits me now to entertain." The violation of the neutrality laws receives a shorter notice, but the language is very decided. The following paragraph contains the substance of the matter:- " 3Meantime, the matter acquired additional importance by the recraitments in the Ulnited States not being discontinued, and the disclosure of the fact that they were prosecuted upon a systematic plan devised by official authority; that recruiting rendezvous had been opened in the principal cities, and depots for the reception of recruits established on our frontier; and the whole business conducted uLder the supervision and by the regular co-operation of British officers, civil and military-some in the North Aulerican provinces, and some in the`United States. The complicity of those officers in an undertaking which could osnly be accomplished by defying our laws, throwing suspicion over our attitude of neutrality, and disregarding our territorial rihts, is conclusively proved by the evidence elicited on the tnal ofsuch of their agents as have been apprehended and convicted. Some of the officers thus implicated are of high oficial position, nd many of them beyond our jrisdiction; so that legal proceedings .ould not reach the source of the misehief. "These considerations, and the fact that the cause of complaint was not amere casual occurrence, but a deliberate design, entered upoin with a fuU knowledge of our laws and national poliec, and conducted by responsible public functionaries, impelled me to present the case to the British Governimnent, in- order to secure not only a cessation of the wrong, but itsreparation. The subject is still under discus- .sion, theresult of wlhich wil be communicatedto you inlueI I tune." The question of the Sound duies is -also treated at length. The Presidentthinks that the IUnited States "ought not to submit to the payment" of these dues, but is willing that they should "share liberally with other Powers in compensating Denmark for anv advantages which commerce shall hereafter delive fr om expenditure made by her for the improvement and safety of the navigation of the Sound or Belts." I believe I wrote you in my last letter why I thought an offer of this sort amounted to nothing, and could not be very acceptable to Denmark. The relations -with the rest of the world are rapidly glanced over. WNith France, and Greece, and Spain several matters have been adjusted. AVith IMfexico things do not look quite so comfortable. The interposition of Government has been demanded in favour of citizens of the United States whose persons and property have been injured, for which mjuries the Mexican Government is responsible ; and the threat is held out that a demand for reparation will be made as soon as anybody can hold the chair of State of that coimtry of revolutions long enough to listen to it. Nicaraguan fillibustering is passed over vith a short paragraph, the condition of the various departmenits touched upon (including the satisfactory condition of the treasuy), and the Message then closes with rather less than the usual amount of matter for home consumption. The prominence given to Central Anmerican affairs in the MIessage gives additional importance to the present position of this Government towards Walker and hisparty.The recraitingforNicaraguabegan last summer, under the Spanish authorities; but under the auspices of the Transit Company, and with the co-operation of MIr. Marcoleta, the then Nicaraouan MN inister, a number of men were raised here (mostly, or entirely Germans) to goto Central America in the service of the Government. As soon as the mnatter came to the ears of the district attorney he took steps to prevent furthler enlistment, but enough had already been done to excite the attention of the British Government, and remonshaunces were made at Washington upon the subject, to which the Cabinet at lashington were able to say that steps had already been taken to put a stop to these things. I do not thinlk that any more recruiting went on under Spanish auspices-at least from the Atlantic ports; andthose thatdidgolhave nearly all succumbed to the climaate. When Walker, with the help of a certificate of naturalization furnished him fox. the purpose, made his descent from San Francisco and succeeded in establishing himself, the, offices wvere again- opened- in New Yorli on behalf of the, new Government. The newlyaPppointed NicaraOgan Minister and the agents of the Nicaraguan Tiansit Corapany have denied any complicity in these movemrents; but, on the other hand, there is evidence (of what weight or credibiliy I cannot now state, nor, if I could do, I suppose you would not wish me to sit in judgment -upon it tending to sho* not-only that all these *parties knew of these movements, but that the Cuban Junta -were implicated in -it, and intended, as 'soon as 1,500 men sholld be- organized and in Nibaragua, to drill them with reference to a descent upon Cuba. The new Governmont has renewed to the company their exclusive privilegge for a terr of 99 year. - Except the hay aspect of the foreiga relations w1xich the Mestage discloses, the new year opens verywe foitlie United StaleD. oThecornwandotiou crops have both been larger thian rwas; ever before knOown, and simultaneously ith the latter there has beenl greawt demand of breadatufffor xpor- tation.

SECOND EDITION. THE. TIMES OFFICE, wed&itsdayV Moran. FRANCE. (BY SUMU M AN)D 3RTIS rTLEGRAPH.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PALS, WEDN-SDAY, JAx. 16, 8.30 As. "'The Monitevr publishes the report of the Minister of Finances to the Emperor upon the fanancial condition of the country. "IThe report concludes as follows .- " 'To resume, Sire, this simple sketch of the principal financial events of the past year shows us a commercial activity without a parallel ; unheard of progress in consumption; two enormous loans, paid up withl the greatest regularity, and in a great measure before the payments were due; besides the loans, more than 185,000,000, a sum which had never before been known to have been employed in the purchase of rentes, for the departments; the direct contributions paid by anticipation, and almost without expense; a well balanced budget; the floating debt reduced; and all this despite the war, despite the crisis in the high price of food, despite the very considerable outlay which accidental circumstances imposed upon us. What greater proof could be given of the vitality and richness of the country and. of all that France is capable of inder apoptolarGovermuent, with such resources wisely employedc? Extravagance alone might be feared. Your Mfajesty will know how to obviate that danger by your high prudence, by firmly opposing the inconsiderate temptations of speculation, and. by adjourning, in the interest of the enterprises already commenced, all those which d> not bear the evident mark of urgency."' EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.:- Letters from Bucharest of the 29th state that the conditioni of peace relative to the. Principalities has produced there extraordinary agitation. " The Austro-Russian party," they say, "And Prince Stirbe are in the greatest joy at being dte livered from the fear of the condermnation of their acts by the Porte, and that as they will now have only to deal with the population they risk no danger. In fact, placed as they are in power, aided by Croatian soldiers, and with the means of corruption at their disposal, they feel no doubt of being able to turn matters entirely in their favour. The project about consulting the wishes of the population will be in the hands of Stirbey nothing more nor less than the simple reproduction of what passed in Ig30, when the same Stirbey served as the scapegoat to the agents of Russia. On that occasion also RussiB put forvard the ancient Capitulation in order to keep the Principalities at as great a distance as possible from the Porte. She then stipulated, as it apper-s the allied Powers now stipulate, that the internal organization should be independent, that it should be elaboated by the Wallachians themselves, and that the Porte wvould merely have to sanction what had been adopted by the country. The clause which established that the definitive org3nizatioi should be the result of tlle free expression of the will of the people is but a bitter derision as long as Stirbey is maintained in power, and consequently in a situation to divert to other purposes the application of the clause; and little doubt can be entertained that in his fut-ure conduct he will give the lie to his antecedents. As nuns are decked out in finery for the last time the day they pronounce the last vows which separate them from the world,-the Principalities vill be aryed with the splendour of the popular will, but only to express their own conidemnation, and to be, as it were, the posthumous annex to the partition of Poland. You must chersh an irresistible desire forpeace to sacrifice us so complacently, and to do so by the saine discreditable means employed on a former occasion by Russia. " For a long time past our wretched population was grotning under the tyranny and corruption of this Governor, who in his peculiar vay has surpassed that of All of Janina. Instead of doing justice to their complaints, the Allies inform them that they are to give expression to their own wishes. Are you, indeed, so simple, or so indifferent to our n isfortunes? The Cabinet of Vienna, the only one thathas no right over us, is the only one which disposes of our fate. It succeeds in maintaining in the Hospodariat the man thrrugh whom it hopes to eleat the Wallachians out of their promised guarantees. It is true that the English Government eo not, seem satisfied at this state of things, if we may judge by the dignified attitude of their agent during this second edition of Muscovite jugglery. But, on the other hand, the French agent does not attempt to conceal his approval of the acts of the Hospodar, in whosefdtes and amusemnents, and those of his Court, he is ever a sharer. " In the meantime the.brutality of the Croats continues the same. An incident which occurred lately will enable yen to form ajust notion of our situation. The authorities of the capital and of the aistrict, urged by a feeling of compassion, implored Prince Stirbey to address some obser-a. tions to the Austian Commandant. The Hospodar replied that he did not v wish to hear such affairs spoken of, and that he forbade tae to report to him the cries of the victims." The following appears in the M1inisterial paper La Patrie, and there is reason to believe it has been communicated from a semi-official source:- " The return of m Seebach to Paris has given rise to the same ramourwhich was circulated on his departure. From special information communicated to us from Germany we are enabled to affirm that this Minister has not been charged with any official diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg or to any otherplace. "Our Vienna correspondent *writes as follows:'Austria has seriously taken charge of the -whole of the weight of the last negotiations which are going on at this moment. As she does not decline the responsibility of her acts, and the vigorous duties which an unfavourable issue may impose on her, she has wished that the whole of the action should bear entirely on her. " ' The Western Powers, confident of her sincerity and good faith, have entirely given up to her the diplomatic ground, and you may be certain that nothing wi2l pass except by way of Tienna. It is between our Emperorand the Czar that the question is debated at this moment, and it is for this 'hat it wiJl become our own quarrel, if Russia repeatsthe refusal which terninated the conferences of 187.5."' The following private telegraphic despatches have been received "BERLIN, J.%N. 1.5. "It is genem'ay reported here that Prince GortschaLoff is preparing to leave Vienna. "The 1ith is the day mentioned for his departture. The Prince will, however, vait for final orders from St. Peters. burg." N " HAMBURG, JAN. 14. "Twro vessels of war have arrived at Copenhagen from England, proceeding to the Baltic to cruize before the Rusia porte." " MADRIID, JAN. 14. "Marshal O'Do:mell has resumed his duties as Minister cf War. "The Government has granted an amnesty to the Carlist prisoners of Catalonia, on account of the complete pacification of the princpality. General tranquillity prevails." The Emperor feviewed to-day, at 1 o'clock-, in the C-omt of the Ts-.ileries and on the Place du Carrousel, the different corps of the Imperial Guard and Arny which lately returned fiom the Crimea. This military solemnity had for its principal object the distribution of the commaemorative medals; granted by the Queen of Great Britain to the officers, non-commi3sioned officers,- and soldiers who took part in the glorious campaign in the Unmea. At a quarter-past 12 the troops had Ql-kady asiumed the dfferent positions assigned to them', and were drawn up in 17 lines, facing the Palace of the Tuleries. General Regnault de St. Jean daAngely had the chief command of the troops. General 3lellinet commanded the infantry of the Imperial Guard, composed of two brigades, the first - under the orders of General Maneque, and consisting of the Engineers, Foot Chaeeurs, and the 1t and 2d Regimnents of Voltigeurs; and the second, under those of General Clere, formed of the Zouares, the 1st and 2d P.egiments of Grenzdiers, and the Regiment of Gendarmnee The arstery of the Guard was commanded by M. de PRocbebouet. Generai Forey wa at the head of his division, which was composed of the 20th, 39th, 50th, and 97th Regiuents of the line, formerly two brigades under the command of Generals Repond and Blanchard. The 17 lines were composed as follows :-First line, a company of Engineers, anda battalion of Foot Chassemus; 2d lne, the 1st battalion of the 1st Voltigeurs- and 3 companies of the 2d; 3d, 3 other companies of the 2d battalion and the 3d battalion of the same regiment ; 4th, the 1st battalion of the 2d Voltigeurs and 3 companies of the 2d; 5th, 3 other companies of the 2d battalion and the 3d battalion; 6th, the 1st battalion of Zouaves and 3 companies of the 2d; 7th, three other companies of the 2d battalion and the 1st battalion of the 1st Grenadiers; 8th, the 2d battalion of the 1st Grenadiers and 3 companies of the 3d; 9th, 3 other companies of the 3d battalion and the Ist battalion of the 2d Grenadiers; 10th, the 2d battalion of the 2d Grenadiers and 3 companies of the 3d; 11th, 3 other companies of the 3d battalion and the Ist battalion of Gendarmes; 12th, the 2d battalion of Gendarmes; the four following lines were formed of the 20th, 39th, 50th, anld 97th Regiments of the Line; and the 17th line of batteries of Artillery of the Imperial Guard. At lalf-past'12 platoons of honour of the Guard repaired to the Tuileries to bring, out the colours, and at 1 o'clock the Emperor mounted his horse at the Pavillon de Flore. His Majesty was accompanied by His Royal Highness the Dulke of Cambridge, Prinoe Napoleon, Marshals Vaillant and Magnan, Generals Canrobert and Niel, Admiral Lyons, General Martimprey, chief of the staff of Marshal Polissier, General Espinasse, and a numerous and brilliant staff, among whom were a number of English and Sardinian superior officers. The cortege of the Emperor was partly composed of his military household, his aides-de-camp, and a detachment of Cent Gardez. At the same moment the Empress, followved by her ladies of honour, took her station on the balcony of the Pavilion de l'Horloge, and all the windows of the Palace were in an instant filled with ladies elegantly attired. The Emperor havingreviewed the troops placed himself, with the Duke of Cambridge, before the Pavilion de lHorloge, when the distribution of the medals commenced. His Royal Highness was handed them by Colonel Franconnier, first aide-de-camp to the Mhinister of WVar, and distributed them himself to the superior officers, one Captain, one Lieutenant, and one subLieuteniant of each regiment. The soldiers had already received theni in the morning and pmined them on shortly before the defile. The medal is about the size of a crown-piece. On one side is the effig of the Queenof England, with the words "Victoria Regina." The reverse representsan allegorical figure. The defile began about 2 o7clock, and each platoon, as it passed by, cried " Iire l'EBnpcreur!" " Vire PImperatrice!" Fi Ve cla Reine Ficforia!" and " Vice le Dicc (le Cambridge!" the bands of the different regiments alternately playing the English and French national airs. The defile lasted until half-past 3. There were about 22,000 men on the ground. The sailing frigate Reine Blanche left Marseilles on the 13th inst. for the Black Sea, with a cargo of munitions of war and mt&Srtd. The frigpate Syrene arrived at Toulon on the 14th, coming from the Black Sea. The more important intelligence received during the last few days has completely thrown in the shade minor events. I forgot to notice a fracas which commenced on Saturday at the Sorbonne, and terminated for the present at the Rue de Courceles the same evening. It seems that a mutiny had been organized among the students who attended the lecttures of M. Nisard, Professor of Literature at the Sorbonne, against the Professor, who has fallen into disgrace with the young gentlemen by reason of an alleged change in his political opinions. The consequence of this change was the Professorship, for which it is not denied, I believe, that he is very fit.. The rioters refused to hear him, and the Sergens de Vile had' to be called in to restore order. The more noisy and riotous were arrested; out the Professor had to depart home. The students followed him to his house, and attempted to enter it forcibly. The guard had to be called out to disperse them, and as some resisted not less than 40 of them were taken into custody. During the scuffle two sergens de ville were wounded from a blow of a stick, one of them dangerously. It is believed that some further disturbance is threatened for Saturday next, but measures are taken to repress it. The MEnister of Foreign ffHairs gave a dinner on Niunday to the Duke of Cambridge, at which were present the Ministers, the diplomatic corps, and the English Generals and Admirals now in Paris. The Monifeur publishes decrees authorizing a number of natives of France to accept and wear foreign orders. Among the number are M. Troplong, President of the Senate, as Grand Cross of the Belgian Order of Leopold; M. Haussmann, Prefect of the Seine, Commander of the Neapolitan Order of Francis L, of the Portuguese Order of Notre-Dame de Villa-Viciosa, of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle (2d Class), of the Sardinian Order of St. 3Maurice and St. Lazarus, and of the Swedish Order of Wasa; Vice-Admiral Trehouart, Grand Cross of the Spanish Order of Isabella the Catholic; M. Gudin, the marine painter, Commander of the Spanish Order of Charles MI., and of the Dutch Order of the Oaken Crown, Knight of the Prussian Order of Merit, and of the Turkish order of the Nicham-Iftikhar; Prince de Latour-X'A-vergne-Lauragais, French MIinister at Florence, Grand Cross of the Saxe-Weimar order of the White Falcon.

The despatch which was received yesterday from Count Valentine Esterhazy contained in. analysis of the Russian counter-propositions, and a most unpleasant impression it has producedin official circles. The Austro-Russian party avers that the concessions which the St. Petersburg Government has loffered to make are likely to satisfy the Western Powers and Austria, but such is not the case. Russia refuses to cede the part of the Bessarabian territory which lies between Chotym and the chain of mountains that terminates at the Sasik or Salt Sea. There is reason to believe that instead of this she offers to cede MHoische, and such other islands as are between the Sulina and St. George's mouths of the Danube. Russia has never had a right to form any military establishment, on the islands in question. In the 3d article of the treaty concluded between Russia and the Porte, on the 14th of September, 1829, it is said:- " The Pruth shall continue to form the limits of the two Empires, from the point at which it toucies the MIoldavian territory to its confluence with the Danube. From this point the frontier line shall follow the course of the Danube down to the embouchure of the St. George arm, so that all the islands formed by the different arms of the river sball reulain in the possession of Russia, although the right bank will, as heretofore, belong to the Porte. It *is, holvever, agreed ihat this right bank, from the point where the St. George arm separates from that of the Sulina, shall remain uninhabited for a distance of two hous from the river (cc tlcurc), and that no Idnd of establishment shall be formed there, and that on the islands which-remain in the possession of Russia there shall, with the exception of the quarantines which mnay be formed, be no establishment or fortification." Another version is that Russia offers to cede 0U the islands between the St. George and Sulina arms and between the latter and the KRilia arm of the river, but this concession is of no real value, as the Principalities will always be at the mercy of Riisia if she is allowed to retain the western part of Bessarabia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is continually closeted with the Emperor, and some of the best-informed persons in this city are of o;inion that Count Valentine Esterhasy will be in Vienna before the world is a fortnight older. All the organs of the Vienna press consider the propositions of the allies remarkably moderate, and find it perfectly natural that they should demand a part of Bessarabia in exchange for Kinburn, Eupatoria, Sebastopol, Kainiesch, Balaklava, and Kertch. The despatches, the summary of which arrived yesterday, were sent away from St. Petersburg by Count Esterhazy on Monday, the 7th. Count Esterhazy's telegraphic despatch is said to have filled four quarto pages. As has already been said, Count Stackelberg, who vill probably bring a letter from the Czar to the Emperor Francis Joseph, is not likely to reach Vienna until the day after to-morrow, the 14th. The traveling European world has, at length, some prospect of being able to get from London and Paris to Vienna and the East without being obliged to go round by Magdeburg and Dresden. During the last 10 or 12 weeks no fewer than seven or eight different companies have endeavoured to obtain from this Government the "patent right" to construct a railway from Vienna, by way of Linz, to Salzburg. 3any first-rate English firms were also competitors; but the promise of the Emperor and of the MIinisters of Public Works and Financeshas been given to Messrs. 3Merck and Lindheim, who will, however, be obliged to give a considerable share in the undertaling to the newly established Credit Bank. This evening the Administrative Council of the Credit Bank will meet, and full powers will be given to some of its leading members immediately to come to terms with Messrs. Merck and Lindheim. The Nortiern Railroad Company and a well-known English "ent,-epreneum" were also extremely desirous to obtain the " concession," but they did not take thefielduntilthe Ministersweremorally engaged to MI. Merck, the Hamburgmillionnaire. The railroad from Salzburg to Vienna will certainly pay as well as that from Vienna to Oderberg, and it would be difficult to say more in its favour, as the oriinal holders of Northern Railway shares have for many long years received five per cent. interest for their capital, and a dividend of some 13 or 14 per cent. There are few coumtries in which more money may be earned by clever speculators than in Austria, but, in my opinion, the best thing which this Government had in its gift was the right to construct a railroad from this city to the Bavarian frontier. Vast quantities of corn and wood and great numbers of cattle are sent from Bavaria to Aus*ria and there are besides very valuable coal mines between Linz and Salzburg. According to a treaty condluded some time since between Austria and Bavaria, the MIunich-Salzburg-Vienna Railroad was to be c=ompleted within a certain time, but the Austrians were unable to fulfil their engagements, as the engineers subsequently declared it to be " imwossible " to construct a railroad from Brnck in Upper Styria to Salzburg, as had been projected.| The principal conditions made between this Govemmnent and Messrs. MIerck and Lindheim, the persorms w3o are to construct the Vienna-Salzburg, or " Western Railroad," are as follows --The grant is for 90 years, and the capital of the Company 60,000,000 of silver forms. Two-thirds per cent. of the net profits will be set aside as an amortization fund. The founders will be allowed zper cent. as an indemnification for their surveying and other expenses, The railroad, which is to run from Vienna, by way of Linz, to Salzburg, will have two branch lines-the one to Passau, on the Danube, and the other to Knfstein in the TyroL The sh the Credit Bank in the undertuldur js '20,000,000fl., or one-third parl.7 - A company, com:posed of Baron James Rothschild, and some Englsh and Frenich firms, will probably be interested t6 the amount of 10,000,OOO., or one-sixth pat. It was proposed that a considerable number of the Bavarian cavalry and artillery hores should be sold, but the King (ALsximilian) has refused to give his consent to the measure. Anstria, says the Fratiifart Post-zciat.g reduced the two armines on her northern frontiers, in order to give the Russian Govemnment an opportmity of accepting the new propositions with a good grace, but if Count Esterhazy should be obliged to quit his post, His lMajesty the Emperor Francis Joseph will, as he did two years ago, issue a preparatory proclamation, order a fresh levy, "and then take further measures." What is meant by "ftrthet, measures" "need not be said. A letter received by the Oesterreiddsiice Zefttng from Constantinople contains some information of interest. At the demand of the Kassam, the official trustee of widows and orphans, Omar Pasha's house at Constantinople has been "sealed up." The measure was taken in favour of the* Sirdar's children by his late wife, who at her death left a large property. The demand to put the official seal on the doors of Omar Pasha's house was made a month ago and refused; but the Sirdar is under a cloud, and eonsequently justice is allowed to take its course. Omar Pasha has tendered his resignation to the Sultan, but it was refused. The 3gyptian contingent has already embarked for Trebizond. The weather has for the last few days been remarkably mild. IRUSSIA. (FROx OUR BERLaI CORTISPOONDENT.) BERIUN, JAn. 14. It is probably owing to the intervention of the Christmas holydays in St. Petersburg that I have no more recent dates than the 6th instant, at vhich the thoug,hts of most persons seemed to be turning away from politics and towards the festivities of that evening (Christmas-eve) and the following days. The Russian Christmas-day (Jan. 6th) has, in addition to its rgligious importance, also an historical significance: it is celebrated in commemoration of the expulsion of the French out of Russia in the year 1812; the day is -always marked by salvoes of artillery from the walls of the PeterPaul Citadel, and the Court attends Divine service in state. Al the dignitaries of the army and fleet are commanded to attend in the Chapel of the Winter Palace; both gentlemen and ladies in national costume. After Divine service and the holding of a parade the more festal character of the day comrnmences, which generally provides ample exercise for the patience and forbearance of the Bcdu.scLnicks. On the 7th, the Princess Alexandra of Oldenburg was to be confirmed in the bosom of the GrOeco-Russian Church, previous to her solemn betrothal with the Grand. Duke Nicholas on the following day. The High Steward of the' Court of Oldenburg, Baron von Freitag, had arrived in St. Petersburg towards the close of last month for the purpose of arranging with the Russian Chamberlain all theceremonies that should accompany these acts of confirmnation, betrothal, and marriage; the latter is expected to take place on February 16, when the Court miourning wvil be at an end. The 1inralide has already contained all the details of the ceremonies to be observed on the occasion of the confirmation, to which great impoitance appears to be attached, involving, as it does, the Princess's entrance into the pale of the State Church, the betrothal of the following day consists of the extension of the blessing of the Church to the actual betrothal, which took place some time back. As soon as the ceremony of admission into the, Greek Church has taken place the Dowager Empress leads the young Princess up to the holy relics for her to kiss them, aand from that moment she bears the name and title of "Orthodox Princess Alexandrine Petrowna." In no St. Petersburg letter that has come into my hands was there any indication of the result of the two missions, Seebach and Esterhazy, but nearly all coincided in the belief that the year 1856 bears in its womb as little chance of pacification as its predecessors. Baron Sceobach arrived in St. Petersburg onthe29thofDecember, andonthe same eveningpaid his father-in-law, Count Nesselrode, a visit. His officialreceptiontookplaceonthe3lstofDecember. On the two - following days he had also lengthy conferences with the Chancell6r, and at' the latter of the two Count Fsterhazy was also present. Up to the 2d inst. neither of the diplomatists had had any audience of the Emperor. As the Russian answer to the Austrian proposals has been already published in Vienna, and is doubtless known to you by this time, I need not repeat any of the conjectures formed in St. Petersburg as to the probable result of the missions, the less so that all these Russian correspondents confess to being eatirely uninformed as to any facts. What little is brnited. about here (Berlin) as to the result of the Seebach mission is, that it has been by no means fruitless, and. that the Baron has, on the contirry, been empowered by the Russian Cabinet to continue to exert himself in Paris for the attainment of a peace on the principles already put forward by him in St. Petersburg. It appears now to be a settled thing that M. Fonton, the Russian Minister at Hanover, takes the place in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lately occupied by the late M. Labienski. The Russian Government continues to devote minute attention to the military organization of the Baltic provinces, so as to be prepared for all eventualitiesin that quarter. General Schultz, 'who had a cominand-inSebastopol, and was subsequently secqnd Commander in Nicolaieff, has been nominated Commander in Dunamunde; General Nordenstrang has been attached to the Command-in-Chief in Finland; Colonel Furabjehn, formerly Adjutant to General Bodisco in Bomarsund, has been sent into Finland as Governor of one of the districts there, for the purpose of completing the military organization of the population. Prince Mensehikoff is stil detainedin St. Petersburgbyindisposition. A great number of appointments, dislocations of troops, &c., took place while General Siewers was still in'St. Petersburg; he has now left for Mitau. The Neva batteries are to be strengthened and lengthened on both flanks, and the result of this and of a variety of other military arrangements in and about the capital is to prcduce an agitation of feeling among the people, as though the enemy were just about to appear before the town. Add to this the warlike fanati- 'l tone of the journals thatstand. nearest the_Cowt, and *esee what an ungenial soi the pacific missions of the German Powers fall upon.. Various corre- spoildents describe this excited state of exacerbated feeling as perfectly overpowering, and drowning the secret yearnings that every member of the upper clas-es Unavoidably entertains for peace. A correspondent of the Kreu= Zeitung, writing from St. Petesburg, Jan. 1, descrbes it as an impossibility for Russia to nmake peace as long as a'foreign soldier tiM stands on Russian soil, and adds with regard to the ymosibility of the Austrian proposals beingac- I ,epted,- -5 - ~ ~~~~-' "least of ll is any conession to be thoight of toIards any demand made by England, for you bhae no conception. of the hatred that has penetrated through a 1 else of th c Rusin natiozxgaiunt land.

As previous COmmunications from this correspondent did not betray that he was insane, we -must assume that this rabid frenizy is the reflex of Russian feeling, atleast in his circle. * The continual nominations that ae being made to the equipages of the Black Sea wi serve as a convincing demonstration how little the GCovernment is thinking of renouncing the plan of restoring the lost fleet to its former power. An evidence also of the determination of the Govemment to suppre6s the spirit of pecalation and corraption that appea to be Eo intimately intertwined in Russian administration, is to be found also in the frequent e-' posures and punishment of dishonest emy?oajs that are now takdng place. The Marine Jotrna a few days back published the degradation of an officer of the Commissariat of- the Eeet of the Black Sea, for "aiding and abetting in the getting up of false documents." St. Petersburg letters mention also that the iinister of War has laid before the Emperor "a judgment pronounced by a Council of War, wwhfch, when it is published, will excite as much sensation as the peculations of Politowlki did, who had embezalcd a million of roubles from the funds of the Invaliden." The parties affected are seveu members and the President of a Tribunal of Commerce in the south. They are understood to have made very free with ithe State Treasury as well as the funds of the Tribunal itself. This affair is, doubtless, the same as that mentioned in advices from Odaess, awcording to which the President of the Tribunal of Commerce there, Staatsrath Hanulei, in consequences of abuses that have arisen from his negligence, as well as excess of power arrga}ted by him on several cecaans, has been dismissed the service with the prohibition of being ever employed again, and condemned at the same time to three months' imprisonment in a fortress; he is further suspected of having made use of the capital of the Tribunal of Commerce for his own profit and advantage. Four other members of the same Court are dismissed the service, and declared to have lost the confidence of the Goverinment, and to be incapable of furtler employment. A number of other parties are mentioned, amounting in all to about seven persons, for different degrees of culpability, degraded and condemned to various degrees of punishment-one of them is the treasurer of the circle of Odessa, who is condemned to serve in the army as private. The amount deficient in both the treasury of the circle and the fimcls of the Tribunal of Commerce are described to be very considerable. There are advices from Warsaw, which for the present are not confirmed, though sadly in want of confirmation, to the effect that various changes are about to be made in the command of the different bodies of Russian troops engaged at the various theatres of war. Thus, General Bebutoff is spoken of as being about to take the post of second commander of theCaucasian army. General 1.ouravieff to talke the supreme command in the Crimea, with much extended powers; General Prince Gortschakoff would then take the supreme command in all the provinces of SouthRussia, with his head-quarters in Kischeneff; while General Luders would command under him in Bessarabia. General OstenSacken would remain in Nicholaeiff and Cherson; while General Paniutin collects all the reserves at Sitomir. WEST INDIA AND PACIFIC MTAILS. (B3Y BECNCIC TELEGRPHl.) SOUTH&MPTON, JA'. 16.

The Plata brings 21 paSsengers and 13 distressed British subjects. On freight there are 858,540 dollars' value in specie, 14,000 dollars? value in precious stones, and a cargo of cochineal, bark, indigo, cocoa, &c. The Atrato arrived at St. Thomas from Southampton on the afternoon of the 31st ult. On the 14th inst. the Plata spoke the ship City of Ilobile, bound easterly. At Jamaica the Legislature had adjourned to the 14th inst. Fever was prevalent, and the mortality had been very great. The markets were dull. The stock of bread was abundant, with no iquilry. There was very little coffee in the market. Corn of good quality was scamrce. Exchange on London for bills at 90 days was quoted at 1 per cent. premium. From British Guiana we learn that the Coutrt of Polcy met on the 12th ult. The weather was favourable to the crops, and the young canes were looking welL Business was dull, and freights high. At Grenada the Legislature was stillin session. The weather was favourable, and sugar-making was being rapidly proceeded with, although the crop would not generally begin before February. The canes were looking well, and the cocoa plantations promised abundance. Ships were very scarce, and arrivals were anxiously expected. The Pacific Steam Navigation Company's steamer Valdivia had arrived at Panama, with $3,000 in specie for England; and dates, from Valparaiso, Nov. 30; Callao, Dec. 10; Paita, Dec. 15. Advices from Peru state that every syaptom of another revolution was apparent; Castilla was losing his influence, arrests were being nightly made in Lima of persons supposed to be inimical to the Government. At Valparaiso considerable quantities of gold had been discovered, the quaity of which is excellent. In the markets sales were limited in consequence of the scarcity of foreign arrivals. The flour trade was animated. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHIES. (FROM OUx OWN COnRSPO'NarsZ.) SOUTHAPTON, WEDIESDAY MOBLnZG.

EAST PRUkSSIA. . (7ox oUR o- CO1sPiDEN-.1 .) DAIÂ£TSIO, JAM If In consequence of the mild weather and almost eontinual thaw which has during the past three weeks been expenenced in the Baltic the ice has -> far disappeared as to render communication with the Russian porta practicable. Several vessels from' Memel, principally laden with salt and ooals have already, succeeded in reaching the harbour of iEbau in safety; while ,tthers, it is said, have pushed near enough to Riga to be able to discharge their cargoes on to tlle ice, over which they have been subsequently, conveyed in sledges to the town itself. Among the latter is reported the Washington, an American vessel, which has b6en lying during the greater part of the past siimmier at openhagen. A Swedish vessel, which arrived at Dantsic some three weeks since, with a cargo of rye from Stockholm, has within the last few days sailedagain fromhere; she has a cargo of coals, and her destination is s"l to be Sweaborg. A Dutch vessel, likewise laden with coals, and bound for the same place, left here the day before yesterday. It is not, however, probable that thin state of things will continue much longer; dumng the last 24 hours a decided change both of wind and weather has taken place. A hard frost has set in; which, to judge from appearances, seems likely to reman for sdnme time to come. On reviewing thle returms of the export or thoher from this place durngt the past year, it seems that the high expectations entertained at the commencement have not been fally realized. Throughout the whole season the character of this important branch of trade has been more or less ianguidl anid depressed, without, however, causing any declinem prices. An exception must, nevertheless, be made in favour of shipbuilding materials, suitable for the nghlish and French Governments, the great demand for which had, towards the autunmn, the effect of raising the prices of oak timber and oak plankcs fully 20 per cent. Freights for timber, wfhich have, on the .xverage, been high during the past season, are expected to rule about 20s. to Hull antd London ;lTTs. to 1&s. to> coalports; and 19s. to the east coast of Scotland. Three vessels have been chartered fo- Liverpool t. sil in the spring at 23s. - The com trade has during the year just closed been, on the whole, very aninated, and the sup'plies of wheat from Poland, amounting to some 180,000 quarters, continued to be exported -ith ising prices until the harvest time ariTved. The crops, however, here, as 'wel as in Poland ave unfUtanately proved most deficient, added to which 'the quality of the new v;heats is so w retchled that not one-half is fit for humsan food. The consequence of this is, that the prices of g,rain haverisen toaheight which has not been experienced since 1847.
DIAOLICAL ATTEMPT TO POISON A WZIA. NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, JAlr.'14. Thomas Robson, adiasW illiam Wilson, was broLght e- fore the magistates sitting in the3ranors PoliceCourt to-day, on remand, charged with attempting to poison his wife Elizabeth and her fellow-sermvant on the 1st of December last. Mr. J. G. Stoker watched the case for the prisoner. The facts, as stated by Mr. Dlnn.e, the superintendent of police, and as elicdted in evidence, apear to be paTticularly atrocious. The prisoner wasmarn tohiswife en thbe 21s of June, 1854, at Lamnerton-tollbar. The marria was what is called a "Border wedding. ad the prisoner and his wife had lived tozether at Bsdside Collierv nine months after their weddMg; they then came to Newcdastle, and a few. weeks after thev caine -to reide in this tion the prisoner had enlisted into the army. His wife had purchased his discharge at that -time, but three weeks after that he had joined the Coldstream Guards. She then went to live with 3fr. Foster, of' St. Thomas's-terrace; but five months after that lie had deserted from his regiment, and came down into thdXorth again. He had gone to work at Ilariley-hiLl, and afterwards had removedtoAcomb, near IHexham. His wifeand1 hebad corresponded together during the whole of this time, and he appeared to be affectionate and kind to her. He, however, had never given her any money, and she had gone to -Acomb to see him. He never denied that ho was her husband, and on the 1t of December he had gone to see -ber at Mr. Foster's. His wifc and her fellow-servant, Frances Dobson, iat. with him in the kitchen three hours, ard he appeared to be kind and affectionate to his wife. His wife saw him to the door, and as they were parting he pulled a leinonade bottle out of his pocket, and said that it contained whisky. HIe told -is wvife that be had brought it from Scotland fcr her, that she had to take one-half of it wheu she went to bed,'and give the other half to her fellow-servant, and that it wouid do them good. She looked atthe bottle, and said to him that she thought that the whisky appeared white. He replied that he had put millk into the bottle lest the whisky should intosicate her, and, shaking the bottle , he pretended to put the liquid to his lips and drink- some of it.

2'ME DANUBIAN PRILYCIPALITIES. frioX A, CoMUS%PONDENU-r BIJOHAIUST, I)re. 26. I have just had an opportunity, at the house of a fricnd of miine, who has lately returned frora & business jourfey through all the principal placea of 'Wallachia, of inspecting a nunlber of authentia documnents, which bc had reived from the authoritics of various towns, -who 'parted with thema mnost retdily, seeing that no obligation to secrecy is imposed on the Govermnent maploy&s in WaIlachia withl regard to notorious facts that have taWen place before everybody's eyes; raorcover, there exists but one feeling of indignation in Wallachia that the complaints of all the inhabitants ancd aJl thc constituted authorities as to the conduct of the Austrian soldiery meet with no attention, an d nothing like putnishmenit ensues rith a view to prevenition forthe future. I send you herewith an extract of souie of the reports of the local authorities. As they extend over a considerable space of time,and over ucarly the whole of Wallachia, they afford an interesting p,ror how, alas! only too true those descriptions in the press have been that have represented the discipline ar.d the conduct of the Axistrian soldiery, at all times and in all places, from the time of their entry until now, as extremely defetive and lamentable. On the same occasion I saw a list of all the murders of inhabitants of Wallachia and Moldavia, which, as is shown by official documents, have been comnmitted by Austrian soldiers, with the names and dates attaclbed, togethterwith reference to the reports containingthe facts. If the couirse hitherto pursued of denying the truth of notorious facts be still continued, instead of the persons in authority insisting uipon staicter discipline beinig observed, it is already resolved on to publish thisother list. We should, on lthe other hand, be ctriousa to see a list of any real 3azd corresponding punishments that have been intictced in consequence. Nobody in all lWallachia klown of a single instance of an exemplary punish- nimet and yet it would have been only politic, i had any such taken place, to give it' the greatest AnouAt of publicity pos-sibre, so that men's mne ds might have been tram5withied on tihis point-viz.n that puerfect impuniyh Ls not assured to the culprits. VTho following is the epxtract p have made ftos the ajsove-montioned collection:| An Agustrian sub-odyicer, in a state of drunkenness, soldt himself, Oct. 2, lSS4 with his sabre in his hand, intoh the rooms appropriatedto theaTrchsd re imentlbond, and,| t judgw ubhis threas and hisgesturme, whould hvenwounded ftrious persons if the parties prcsent had not succeeded ing, VelivSring gim in custody to the guard.

A gendb me, a rho was coming orut of this hous, rceived frem ths soldier, as be was enterig, A SAbre wound over his eye, of so grave a nature that li ueobliged to be takeu to the hospital. ThIe Austrian Corpora! Skafa, of the Lancer regiment Yrice Carl, committed an masault on the Bojar Paul Stefauesko, and thereby infdicted on him such severe blows with a cdg*el that he ws left half dead. The Boar's life ws fortunatel .saved oy a nuraber of persons rushing to his r icube. All the proprietors of vineyards in Colentina have sent in coeuylai5ts against the Austriaomilicteaa that they destroy uteir iaineyards, ste their grapes and other fruits, fire ateir pitto!s at the vinedr essers ad other senvnts v;hen olfh renture to remonstrate with them, and even wound hteff with their sabres. The Yellow Commission (local board), in a report dated February 13, 1855, inforned thc police at Bucharest that an Ausrian corporai, h ho had been drinking beer and sprits at the Sfhop of the Serdar Anastasius Gwoti, in the faubourg R.at$ranoul, instead of paying his reckoning, drew hais sabre an wnounded the landlord Joseph, wTho equired payment of bimn. wis alfe woas treaed in the same wray on comig to his help. Nobody could prevent him, for lhc defended bimself with his sabre until he left the shop. nhec same board reporSt on the 70th of 3ay, 1855, to the Bucharest police that an Austrian soldier has run throght with his srword a certain lTede3ko, tau6ovpiste in the filour BDatisre, from which wou nd he died the folnowring day. A Toian belonging to T. Eloresco, wnho was presnt, and endcavoured to come to the astistane of thce uhsa-oir- was also wounded by the soldier. a DesrsueCr InrOy. Some Austrian soldiers wecre marching toar,-ds Bolintintow die Vtli on their road to Bucharest, on thc 30th of Scptember, 185.

A strict investigtion was mrade into the matter, thich cosroborated the above statement, but nothbig has been ever dolic to tih soldier to punish him for the violence coammitted oe then peron of the servant. Thte slb-prfecture of Sr.aov reports to the prefctturv e inu Bu^lhares, under date of September 22, 1854, that the Dutrian .soldiery during their march through that district Sre comrritting anumber of acts of uncontrolled excess, car- intoi the oxen atd the carts, robbing the landed pro. plictoin, and taking from the inhabitants anythinag and cverfiding they take a fancy to. tnotller report of the court of jestice in the p illage of Dbebgon urtscti, sent into theprefecture at Bucharest, dated September 29. 18t4, states that four Austrian solders ca ne into tle tavern there, and, after having eaten and drunk there witholt paying, h egan to mnaltreat an ecclesiastic, prie osent, in the ebectatiorn that the rest of the priests would Pe by thkis conduct compelled to leave the prem.ises.

His brother and sister-in-lawr rushced out to his .assistance on hearing his cries for help; his brother was killed on the spot, and the other pesns vd;o took his part severely beaten. Tuoe inhabitants of Buniasuramadea complaint in Januaryv, 1855=. to the prefecture in Bucharest, that the Austrian; soldicrs, in spite of the severe frost, turned them out of their hsou^es, and their cattle out of their stalls; that they rwere constantly requiring of thenr an unreasonable amount of service and waiting on, vwhich perfectly prevented them from eainizK their own livelihood ; that already, in consequence of tlLi rough treatment, a great numberof their cattle had dild, and in-many other respects they had received conSi4erable dMaX'e To the same effeo' is also a complaint sent in by the saLpefectureof Snagovu. Johann Stefaisko, residing in the neighbourhood of Buchxrn;t, complains that Austrian soldiers quartered in Cqlentina have destroyed his whole vineyard, have dc. xmolihlied his fruit treesi and burnt al his casks. On the bcad gardener's remonstrattin, with them they gave him ceMMral cuts with sabres on his head. The grapes which the soldier` ate were still green, and the proprietor has not been able as yet to obtain any indemnification. DiFSrecr PLOjIce The sub-prefecture of Prahova reports, under date of the 29th of December, 1854, that a troop of Austrian soldier', 209strong, while on its marcl was qurtered in the village obiwarkink oa the various inhabitants for the night. On f-t same night they broke open a warehouse andstole from it 1,00 ok-a of dried plums, 1,600olca of beans, 3 kIlo of Turrirh corn, 2 kilo of barley, I kilo of 'wheat, 2 chestg of usincral vaters, 1,000 oka ofapples, and 500 ola of pears. n *pp!jinigfor anL indemnity to the Austrian coumniander in nimpina the applicants were informed that they rust look for payment from the chief of the regiment of infantry il BuchLarest, Sigiumund. The sub-prefecture of Pnahova reports in Pehruary, lS55, that the Austrian troops, while marching through. com-- mitted aU sorts of excesses ajd violenrce; they broke open tie V ouse- and cellars, and, among others, have robbed 'one hadu Ska&a of 120 plastres. Tlhc Abbot of Bleriow reports to the Ministry of Public '"oegip that the Austrian troops that are encamped there' baye cut down nearly the whole of the forest, and are in .aa probability converting the wood into money, seeing th they hays already received from the local Qovernment all the ilrewood they require. he Police in Plojeschti report to the prefecture, Decem. b r 21. 1854, that A ustrian soldiers, on mecting the shop- boy Xad5ukNowtqko at the eetrenae end of thec tow, beat Iim oyer the head tin he was quite -ssen. ;elefs. f After they baid take u from him w hat Snoneyr he had about him, they gave him three or four Â£tAb3 in the body, from which he died, the hospital withia 24 h ours. : D Isr= rr v :Cn rAr .. .Po,sjtt TheOdor, one of the first semuhcants of Crafova was, Januy 4 ,185, I sree&d'by bustrias at the Ca ^nze (a species of club), where he3s together with a annals er ~of men, i business;> and takub to the prefectur ider erscort, Dkept there several d rthuit any inmvese4ga., tiots eingiiade into bi case , -i;nd v 'i spit6 ~of~ ithes-emon. trncs of the entiie body.of merchantsand e*earZremtstinO on the part of the Prefect. ofan 12,. broken intro the dvweUilg of the merohant Anastasius Scertenmsko, and inflicted on botb himn and his wife (at the time enlceiutc) several mbre wounds. The. captain of this company, on being ionned of the ciucmstance by the brother of the injured man, caused a search to be made through the quarters of the soldiers, by which mears six xnen were discovered whose weapons mere found stained with fresh blood. The certificate of IL Dimitriadi declares. that it was only with the greatest possible care and attention that the lives of this couple could be saved. DISTniCT GIuRGxvo. Complsints from diffrent places sent into the prefecture of Vlaschka show that the Austrian soldiers, whether quartered in ti;e respective localities or only marching through, robbed anid plundered every imaginable sort of rural property and fam stock, maltreati.ng and threatening tUe lives of those 'wlis made any oppDsition. -D)sTxerT RISm October 22, 1854, the Austrian soldiers that were quartered on a tavern-keeper named Constantin, in Riimik, stole the sum of 300 piastres ir the house, aftOr halving first sent the landlady out to fetch water. The wife subsequently saw the money in the possession of one of the nhen, but, on her attempting to take it from him, was boxed on the ear by him. She then held him tight by his clothes, on which he took out of his pocket ten zwanziager and one scossar, and threw them to her; while she picked them up he ran away. Restitution of the money was claimed of the commanding officer; but, although the fact of the t.eft, and the amount stolen were established by him, no restitution was made, nor was the thief in. any way punished. The sub-prefecture of the same iacm reports that the Austrian soldiers quartered on D AlexanderVirkulesko, in lis absence, stole 160 ducats, 80 zwanziger, 20 ells of cloth, watch and chain, six silver spoons, and three silver plates, together with various other artieles of value. Dnrrp.ucr ROmmum.TZI. The sub-prefecture of Oltetz reports to the prefecture of Rotnanatzithat Austian soldiers of the SigismundRogimont (2d Italian Battalion), on occasion of their spending a night in the village of Balsch, were some of theon quartered in the village scplhouse, in a separate apartment of which the village archves were kept. In the course of the night the men brolce open the door of this room and took out almost all the docmnents contained there to cover over their feet and legs, 'nd also for them to lie upon, although ample quantities of straw had been already served out to them. On the following day they burnt a portion of these docamonte, an(d another portion was forud on tie ligh road, scattered about, at a considerable distance from the village. DisTRmcr Tos-mo Szvin. The police of this district reports to the prefecture, Janary 25, 1855, that an Austrian soldier -named Albrecht came during the night from the ship on board of which he wasto the prefecture,and fired a shot at the WaTlachian sentry who was posted at the Mfoney-office on his calling out, " Who goes there?' The sentry was fortunately not injured, and the soldier received as a punishmenat for this attack upon a sentinel 25 blows with a stick on his back ! DISICT BBAILOW. The Brailow policereports, under date MarciLs23,1855, that a certain Jonitza Angel had been mnudered by Austrian soldiers near the Church of St. George; further, two shop. nien had received various wounds from an Austrian soldier on occasion of their asking for payment of goods they had bou1ght. Another person was found by the police on the ploce of the street r.apa Radou, murdered and robbed by Austrian soldiers. Other police reports, sent in from Tirgowischt and other places, showed similar acts of brutal violence and injury donie to life, limbs, and property, from mere recldess love of mischief and destruction. The above are extracted from a larger number of reports sent in by the various authorities in Wallachia. The fol. loswg is an ofnicial statement of the outbreak that took place in the Tower of FoLcschan, on the borders of Wallachia and M1oldavia, and which was considerable enorgh to give risc to N'idely-extended reports of a general rising agai.st the Austrians. The Austrianx garrison of FoLschan consists of Croat infantry and Hungarian cavalry. The manner in wlhich these men conduct themselves passes belief,-they bebave like wild hordes. There is not the slightest trace of discipline, and the clen recognize no authority. Novem'ber 220, in the forenoon, there was a regualar fight on the open 3arket-place between Austrian soldiers and about 200 of the people. The former fought with their bayonets, the latter witb cudgels and sticks. At length an oircer appeared with a patrol, and sent the men back into their quarters. The cause of this row as this :-Austrian soldiers had forced their way into a tavern kept by one Dometer Beteano, and had stolen there everything they could lay their hands upon. The lmdlord resisted, and, on his cries for help, others had come in to his assistance, and thus the fght commenced. The landlord received taro stabs witls the bayonet. On the evening of the same day Austrian EoldiCIs entered the house of the first merchant of the place, an Bnglish subject named Hagi-Koloi, and endeavoured to take forcible possession of hisstables: Koloi asked them if they had billets on him. Without giving him any ansnver they rushed on hidm wKit' drawn sabres. The merch.ant let them enter his wsarehouse, and then found his own &afety in flight. After half-an-hour the local anthor.. ties appeared and found Roloi, half dead withi fright, hidden, under a sofa. The soldiers that prowl abouit the town at night for the purpose of robbing and plundering for the most part wear no uniforms, for the purpose of aroiding de. tection. The Austrians have got a very large stable and irmmense stores of straw collected in the centre of the townr. On the 21st a -wooden staff was brought to the prefectare, hound ro und with cloth or other stuff, and saturated 'with pitcll ; this had been picked ap in the street in the itnacdi,te vicinity of the stable. The greatest apprelhensions ef a conflagratioa are entertained in the town. Letters from Jassy of December 22 mention that the vwinter had brought with it a most utusual severity of cold. On the 16th the Reaurnur thermometer showed 16 deog: ef cold, and ou the 20th there were 23 deg.,-that is to say, 23 deg. Fihrenheit below zero. Ever since tl4e 16th of December the Danube had been finuly frozen over, and all com2munications between the two banks ta!ke place over t' e ice.

The commission loft Suez on the 21st of December, after having studied the roadsted It crossed the Isthmus from south to north, examining on its way the soundings andlevels which have been executed during the last three months, and which will enable the course of the projected maritimre canal to be traced out. - The commision encamped on the 28th of Oecember on the shore of Pelusium, where it embarked on the 31sb on coard the Egyptian steam frigate Lae Nil. This vessel h ad been cruiing for a month in the bay, accompanied by a tender with coals on board. On its first arriv7l at Alexandria the commission had left instructions with M.

Seconded by Id Darrnad, engineer of thie Viceroy, and by ML Cianciolo, an Itilian engineer, he was enabled to present a detailed plan of that portion of the bay the stady of which had been intrusted to bim. The following are the very favourable, and it may ba said unexpected, resalts of the observations made:- Opposite the ruins of Pelusium the soundings gave 8 metres at the, distance already known of 7,50D metres from the shore; but, ta3dng a wvesterly direction, that depth of S metres gradually nears the coast, and is to be found at a dis. tance of onlyf2,350 metres, in a continuous line, running parMllel with the coast for 20 kilometres. This was au immense advantage; the European engineers could not fail to take advantage of it to fix the point for the mouth of the future canal into the Mediterranean. On approaching the coast on this line of 20 kiloraetres, extending between the mouth of Omfareg and that of Gamileh, the soundings gave, with an excellent bottom, a depth of 5 metres at 750 metres, 6 metres at 1,60) metres, and 7 metres at 2,300 metres. The depths of 9, 10, and 12. metres, and more, were sucessively Obtained at vistances of 3,000 and 6,000 metres. It results from these important facts acquired to hydro. gnphjies that the jetties of tho canal in the Bay of Pelusium, the water of which, moreover, is perfectly limpid, need not be half so long as -was at first supposed. The same will bo the case in the Suez roadstead, which was just as little known as that of Pelusium. The International Commission, in its report to the Vice. roy, pronounces itself in favour of the direct line, which it regards as the only solution of the problem of the junction of the led Sea with the Mediterranean. It unanimously declared that the execultion was easy and the success certain. "REPORT TO H%s Hxoa Ss moiHLaNtD SAID P,ASLs, VlsCE1OY OF EGYPT. HI's Highness called us to Egypt to study the question of cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Suez. Providing us with the means of judging upon the spot the mezit of tlhe different solutions proposed, he invited us to submait to him the one most easy, most sure, most advantageous to the conunerce of Europe. " Our investigations, favoured by desirable weatlher, facilitated and abridged by the ample means placed at our disposal, are terminated. "We have found innumerable, or rather insuperable, obstacles to directing the canal on Alexandria, and unexpected facilities for establishing a port in the Gulf of Pelusium. " A direct canal from Suez towards the Gulfof Pelusiu is therefore the only solution of the problem of the junction of thi Red Sea and the 3Iediterraneanm The executionthereof is eas, the success certain, the results inmense for the commerce of the world. " Onr opinion in this respect is unanimons; we puTpose giving our reasons in a detailed pamphlet, accompanie by hydrograplical plans ofthe btys of Suez and Pelusium, with a unap of the conformation of the ground through which the canal will run. "The compilation of this pamphlet will take some time. We shall set about it at once, in Europe, so as to be able to present it to his Highness a few months hence. "For the moment we givo the following conclusions "1. The lino on Alexandria is not admissible in a technical and economical point of view. " 2. The direct line offers every facility for the execution of the lnaritime canal, properly called, with a branch to the Nile, and the usual difficulties for the creation of the twvo ports. " 3. That of Suez will open upon a large and sure road. stead, accessible at al tiines, pritls eIght naetres of water at 1,600 metres from the shore. "14. That tobeformed inthe Gulf of Pelusium, vhich the Ifirst plan placed at the end of the Gulf, will be placed 18 ilometres more to the west, where there are eight metres of water at 2,300 metres from -tho shore, with good anchorage. " 5. The expense of the canal of the two seas and of the works connected with it will not exceed the sum of 200,000,000f., as put down in the estimates of the engineers of the Viceroy.

FATAL BOILFB EXpLOSION AT TIP2ONt, STAFFORDSHIRE. A tearful explosion took place in the works of the Messrs. Hick-man, irobnmasters, of lea Brook, Tipton, onx Monday last, by which four men 1ost their lives and 15 other persondS were seriously injured. There are five boilers on the pre. nises-two oolong and three common furnace boilers. At an early hour on Slonday Thomas Whittingbam, one of tl!e engineers, as usual, and as was his duty, got up the steam in the oblong boilers, to as to enable a portion of the mill and forge to conmnence work, About 7 o'clock he was relieved by Thomas Stacbionse, the other engineer, who tookeharge of theboilbrs, they being, as stated, full of wateratth;e tisne. In about an hour afterwards, and just as the puddlers were ready to drawv their first heat of iron out of the puddling furnace, one of the boilers exploded with a fea-rul noise, and carried awvay a large portion of the zoof by which it was coveed- The greater part of tEe b:6eler vras blown an inmmense height into tho amr, and in its deseent struck two puddling furnaces, broke in the roof at the far side of the works, and scattered bricks and tiles in all directions for a distance of from 150 to 200 yards. The boiler which exploded had both ends blown out, brokc a high-pressure engine of 20-horse power, and killed three men who were at workis the moil. Their bodies were found buried in the ruins. The boiler had been repaired only a fortnight ago, and, according to an arrangement between bIr.

THF RBIUGLBY POISONING CA2SES. TEE IWQUEST ON IM. WALTM P sAMR. RUGELEY, TuESDAY NIacrr, This morning the inquest, opened yesterdayon the body of 31r. Walter Palner, wms eumed in the Town-hall here, before Mr. Ward, the Coroner, and the jury. The court was a6ain crowded throughout the day. Mr. IL A. Deane was preswnt conducting the case on behalf of the Crown, and Mr. William Palmer was represented by his solicitor, Mr. Smith. After our report was despatched yesterday erening the examination of Thomas Walkeden, who, with his wife, attended the deceased during his bad illness and up to his death, was continued. In reply to MLr. Deame he said,-Vhen at Wolverhampton -aces in August lst Mr. Walter Palmer went up to- tho Stand-house and foumd WiDiam Palmer there. He afterwards came to me and said, "Let us go home, I feel very unwelL" After Walter Palmer left me to speak to his brother he treated two policemen to gin and water. They received it throughthewindowofthe Stand-house. Wecame home to Stafford before the first race was quite over. Walter Palmer walked from the station to his own house. I do not think William Palmer was at Castle-teraee on the Monday, Tnesday, or Wednesday. I cannot saywhether Walter took any medicne on coming from the races; he had two or three bottles of mixtures, half full, which he could have taken- if ho pleased. WiDliam came about 10 oeclock on the morning of the day on 'which Walter died. Walter was then in the kitchen, and William went with him into thc parlour, Walter was at that time sick. WIlliam* did not give him anything to prevent hia from, being sick that lan amare of. After Walter had been sick William Palmer followed me out to look at the contents of the basin. He said, it was nothing but nasty bile. I threw it out. W-illinm Palmer then went into the parlour, and found Walter in the fit. I followedm immediately, andsaw Walter lying on the sofa, his head on one sido, and snoring loudly, with drops of perspiration on his face as big as peas. He also vomited. I went to get a glass of cold water for him, and put it in his mouth 'with a spoon, bilt it ran out again] By the de.eire of Mr. William Palmer I put the kettle on the fire, as he said it maight relieve the blood from hiw.head if his feet wrere put in wan water. There 'was a ood fire in the kitchen. Ie kettle w as empty before Xr. eiiamPnr casme. By Mr. Sniith.-I had nerer seen the blaekness in 31r. Walter Palnie's face, except after drinkiing hard. I saw the samne appearance about six weeks before his death, and l\r. William Palmer was not there. I have seen hini take better than hlalf a tunbler full of gin at a time. He has often talked a little wild, but nothing particular. I have often becn that waynyself. Walterlmahrw2astakenivith the fit about an hour after William Palmer came, and r swear that no glass was used after William Palmer calne to the house that morning, exceptthe "lasa of cold water which I got him, Mr. Deane and Mr. Field (the detective) came over to Stafford in Octobor last to inquire about Walter's death. Field saidhehadlbeenispectorofpolice somewhere, and that he was employed by an assurance-office to inquire into Walter Palmer's death. hlr. Deane said nothing. By a Juror.-William Palmer sent me for a bottle of brandy one day shortly before Walter's death; but not on the day on which he died. I never saw William give him any piUls, or any medicine. When I went to fetch the hrn s iUawas in the house with WValter, and my wife wias there also. I drank the greater portion of the brandy, as Walter did not like brandy. I uLsed to drink orut of the sme bottle with Walter. When he was living at Castleterrace William Pahler brought a bottle of brandy one day .and I drank the grea ter portion of it;J bat I cannotsay what day it was. By MKr. Deane.-I cannot say nponF what day it wras that Dr. Day calletl shortly before Walter Palmeor's death. I told Dr.Day on oneoccasion, by Walter Palmer'sowninstruetlonls, that he was from home. I have known Walter Palmer sip aI little of his medicine, and then throwv the rest on the hearth. Walter had a great aversion from takin" medicine. Dr. John Thomas Harland.-l am a physian, residing in Stafford. I knew WalterPalmer. On the 24th of July, 1&55 I examinedhinm forthepurposeof life assurance. Thereport now put in is mine. It is a proposal paper of the Gresham Assurance-office. I reported favoum-aby of the lifc, the ddihithm treCnels excepted. I also stated that his appearance 'was that of a nervous person. althou_h his brother Wiliam told me hIe was reformed. Williard Palmwr called on me at the time, but dlid not say that Dr. Day was attending his brother. (The report stated that there was some indicatiOa of thle hearts action, that tho respiratorlymusmur was correct, andthat.the pulse was at SO.) Wilbam and Walter Palmer caled on me together, and the proposal paper stated that his life had been already accepted in tlhe Prince of lYales office. By Mr. Srnith.-Couhin might produce apoplexy if Conl stantandlviolent. lappliedthestethoscope tinderthe sca-pula and under the chest. I heard no unnatral murmutr anywhere, either back or front. The breathing was perfectly natural. I think the heart palpitation was caused by nervousness produced by drink Thiere was a nervous action of the heart when I exaniined him, 1whichiprobably would have lbecome tnore irrogular by increased intemperance. This irregularity of the action of the hearutight not become an organic disease. There is probably a greater tendency to diseases in cases wvhere there is irregularity of the heart's ateion. It ni"ight produce severe headache, flushing of tile face, and apoplexy. By Mr. Deane.-I sawm nothing in my examination to lead mue to the belief that he had enlargement of the heart. Mrs. Elizabeth Phillips -was next examined. She said,-I am the wife of Jacob Phillips, drysalter, of Stafford. I lived next door to Walter Palnier. I was called into his house on Thursday,-thel6thof Agustilast. It wilsaboutll o'clock in the morning. I 'went into the house and saw Mr. William Palmer and his brother, -who wY6as in a fit. Mr. William Palmer appeared extremely agitated, walking to and fro. Mr. Whtitr Palmer 'was recling on one side of the sofa, with his head on one side. His legs were on the floor, and not on the sofa. He was alive when I saw him- He ap- peared like himtself, but he snored heavily. There 'vas. nothing particuar in the coloutr of his face. I noticed the snorig immediately. His eyes were partially open, and appeared to he fixed. I do not think he was conv Helsed le lived about 15 minutes after I firbt saw him. I have not seen a petson die of apoplexy, but I'have seen a child die, and the medical man satd it would be apoplexy in an adult. The symptoeas in the child were exactly sinrto those I saw in the ease of Walter Palmer. By Mr. Deane.-I 'was ready todo anything when I saw him, but Mr. Williarn Palmer said nothin- could be done as it was too late. MIr. Walter Palmer haa a towel ronud his head that appeared to have been wetted with cold water. I did not offer to put his feet in hot water, as ,Ir. Palmuer said it voild be too late. I noticed omne moisture about the lips. The snoring was like that of a person in a very deep sleep snoring loudly. I did not notice any particular scent or smell in the room. I don't recolct oh an thing unnatural about the eyes. Mr. Willam Palmer a peared to lament in veryfeeling terms, andsaidthathis brther had for some time past drunk more than a bottle of brandy a-ay. I m sure he said "br3ndy," not " spirits." By Mri. Smith.-The mouth looked moist, as if there was saliva on the lips. Nothing wvas given to Mr. Walter Palmer while I was tlhere. Dy theGCoroner.-Mr. William Palmer did not tell me that he had given his brother some brandy that morninlg. By a Juror-I had not seen Mr. WVilliam Pamner arrive at WYalter P?almler's that day. I did not know his person; and, in fact, did not knuow that there w-2S such a person before fhat day. I was not on intimaterms with Mr. William Palmer. lartha Fern exan,ined.-I helped lrs. Walkedexito lay out the body of Mr. Walter Palmer. It 'way Iymg oa the fcfa in the parlour; a handkerchief was thrown over the face, and the hanads were on tbe thighs.. There was nothing particular about the appeaace of the body. The eyes and month were shut. The body was not cold. Igot to the house between 1 and 2 dclocl M!r. Williama Palmer was there. Thle body was lying as if it was asleep. By MIr. Deane.-The limibs were quite limber, and the hands were damp and ol)en'en ve Laid him oat. There was nothing gwaistly orTorble about the corpse; it looSed oquite welt I saw the 'cody the folloing day ard there was colour in the cheeGu' . I have laid, ot many bodies, but never on e 'who died:of apoplexy but -my first husba3nd, and his co2our remained the same after death. Dr. Alfred Sv;ain T.aylor, professor of chymlistry at Gay's lHospital, was next called. He inid,-On Monday, the 24th of Decemuber last, the viscera of the deceased wveie delivered to mec at Guy's H ospital in three earthenwa3re jars, by -InspectorOCrisp. lTo. 1 contained the stomach and duoden,um; 2Nio. 2, the large and smallintestines, one kidncy, and a portion of the larynLx and barynx; No. 3, the liver, spleen, hleart, and a portion of the lungs. They were exanmined by Dr. Rees and myself. The fiyst analysis was made of the stomach. It was pale externally; the coats were thin, soft, and putrifled; the lining membrane was covered with a thin putty-coloured substance, of the consisteucy of paste. At the greater end the stomach was slightly reddened; ong to petst slollesn changes. There was no appeuralne of infampe a- tion, ulceration, perforation, or any orgam disease, and no blood or- bile efflsed in the stomach. Thle large and small intestines 'were healthy. ~Tie snashl intestines coran~ed only abilious-coloured matter on the surface. The large inteties containei ficcal matter, of natural ap earanlce. The kidney was healthy, with 'the exception ot hafing some appearance of congestion. The liver wvas of a pale brown colouri enlarged, and evidentl diseased, the disease being probably of Ion" standing. T~he spleen, heart, and lun"s were healthy. '&e then proceeded to the chymical analysis, and the whole of the parts mentioned wsere separately examined for the detection of- mi3neral and vegetable poison, but vith the result that nopoison' of anykILnd w as detectdein any of thlese organs. -The blood contained m t;he jars wavs submitted to elitixilah analysis, and there was no pioison in it. Tbe pasty tubstance faomn the surface: of the stomnac' was examaned anid contained no poison. The conclusions which we drew frium the anlysis and exaniination were Oese :- " L-That with the eXception of the liver, the viscera of the deceased presented no appearance of disease. " 2. That the enlargerent of the liver, asthe ve.ult of disease, was not such as to account for sudden death. "3. Thatnotnineralorvegetableooison couldbedetectea in anypat of the body. * "4. That there was nothg in the appearance of the viscera to accountfor death. " 5-That in the absence of distinct evidence oftheznastra and duration of the`ilness-0f deeiAwsed,, We ire not able to g,ivo an Opinion- of the cause of sdeath, whether fro* diseasa or Voi4on.'-- Dr. Ptees inid,-I consurred -ih those onclusions, which -wcre drawn uip and signed- on, the 4tk of January last.

Mr. Deane.-Would a man in altFYalmer's state of health bo moro lialilo to the effects of narcotic poison than a person of souad constitution ?-I thinjk he wotad. Mr. Deane.-Would not the condition of the body disarm suspicion -That is a difficult question to ansvwer offhand. I have knowncases -in which men have died from poison vho -were very extensively diseased, and the disease zight account for death although tlhero ws poison present. MIr. Deine.-Coeud poison by morphia or. prnssic acid have left any trae, of its prcseneafter five months '-We could not trace a sufficiency to cause death, supposing no more than a fatal dose were given. : Mr. Smith.-Taidng the cirmunstances described by Mr. and Mrs. WaLkeden and the other witnesses as being proved, and that nothing was put in his mouth for an hour before death, what in your opinion. ws the cause of death?Apoplexg.- '-- A>tpess added that it was not a fact that disease in the body proved that the person died of tho disase hIr. Smith.-Without inidulging in apeculative conjectures, what, I ut, i or opamon of the cause of death? Do you say apop=Oxy ?-f do, certainr. ir. Smith.-Thc'n I ask the solictor fot the Crown whether he intends to proceed with this case further? Mr. Deane.-Ido, mostrerLainly. I have rnost important evidence yet to bring forward. Dr. Taylor.-You will distinctly unulestanc me that I speak on the supposition that every word that the witness *'alkeden had said is correct, and that nothing was given to him for an hour before his death. Of courae if anything clse should appear hereafter to the contrary it would alter my opinion. The proceedings were then adjourned, and, on the inquiry being resumed this morning, Mr. Rtobert Hughes was called. He said, in answer to guestions. by the Uoroner,-I am a on, residing at frord. I had an interview with M.alter Palmer on the 2d of December, 1854. I had received notice from the Solicitors' and General Life Assurance-office that be wonld cal on me on that day, and he came accordingly. BMr. William Palme' accompanied hinL I examined Mfr. Walter Palmer, and gave a certificate as to the state of his health I certified that his general health was good, and the. only remark I though t it necessary to make was, that his pulse was quick and feeblo. I stated that my private opini6n as to his chances of longevity reas, that I derived my information from the representations made by a person whom I believed to be intimrate with him, and that his prospects of long life were not so good as those of a healthy person of temperate habits. .1 was mot led to form this conclusion from any representation of his own. In the form of proposal fornardeel to ne it was stated that l e had! had one attaek of ddirium trcenmcs, a fact which he mentioned to me himself. Tho Coroner. -What, in your Opinion, -was the cause of death from the evidence you have beard9-3Iy opinin, formed beforo Dr. Taylor gave his, is exacty in conformity w,ith it. He was poisoned by gin. The word "intoxicate" meas to poison. lyMr.Smith.-'When I say he Was poisoned by gin I mean that a continuation of this excessive drinking of gin, deposed to yesterday, would destroy life. Itis a proper mse of words to say,. " poisoned by gin.'" I never sawa person poisoned by morplhia orprussic acid. I am not prepared to say that prussic acid might not produce stertorous breathing, but I do not thinl- it woild. By the Coronor.-The effect of pruasic aid is to paralyze the nervous system and to stop every other function. By Mr. Smitlh.-In cases where the nervous functions are pawalyzed by other causes, such as severe shocks or concuission of the brain, the respiratory functions are the last to cease their action, and stertorous breathing might ensue. I have hearni nothing to induce me to alter the opinion that W1alter Palmer died of excessive gim-rinking. A Juryman.-How long would a man last who drank four pints of gin in the day v-The stomachs of different persons vary. One man may bring himself by degrees to consum e opium until lie could eat enoug,h to poison hahf -doven people at once; and so dieth intemperance. Am Ian may bring himself by degrees to swallow great qanatitieS of ardent spirits, which would kill another not aoccustomed to such libations. By the Coroner.-Dctirinre trrnCales wrould certainlyv kill by attacking the brain, the centre of the nervous systena. I never saw aperson who had died of detiriuma trcaunen. I think apoplexy a probable sequence to excessive intenuperance. 1 never knew an instance of ddi7iu7 trecncns folinwsing apoplexy. gre. D'eane Stated, in reply to a iluryan, that the propo,sal to inlsure the lifeofwalter Palier in the Solcitors' and General LifeAssurauce-office, anwd which ass >forid,OOOt., w-as declined. blr.DavidXing Yonckton, a physician residingatRugeley, said-I zmade apsh osorlcre examination of tho bodysholyn to me as thatof the late lValterPal7zer. Itwas shown tome by MIr. Bergen, the chief constable of Lichfield, on Friday, the 21st of December. The corpse was that of a man of middle stature, broad build, and very considerable corpulence. I had never, to my knowledge, seea the body when alive. When I saw it decomposition had commenced, and had proceeded to some extent, especailly aboutthe head andcneck of theposterior-that is,themostdependeut part oftlhcsurfaceof thebody. Theexteziorpresentednosgns of outwvard violence. There vas no dropsical condition of the surface, except that of. the head and face, which was clearly the result of putrefaction or decomposition. The body had been weU nourished, much fat being found in all those parts in which it is usually deposited. The blood had almost entirely soaked out of the corpse. The brain was totally disorganized by decomposition, so that I coulaform no opinion of its state at the time of death. At one or two points the lungs were adherent to the -alls of the chest. This is by no means an unusual appearance, although certainly a diseased one, bht is, in fact, a very common condition of the body of adults. The lungs were somew-hat decomposed, but not to such an extent as to prevent any evidence of disease of an orgaruc nature, had such existed durig lItfe. The liver was somewhat larger and harder than usual, but showed no other exterial evidence of disease. The kidney3 w:ere rather softer than ordinary, but I am not prepared to say wliether this was the result of putrefaction or of disease. The external appearance of both was healthy, and on maln-I ing the dissection of one it did not present an unhealthy appearance. The other was not examined by me, because it had been placed with the other riscera in one of the jars to be transmnitted for analysis to Londoni. The whol length of the aliuentary canal, including the mouth, throat, gullet, and intestines, was carefuUy examined, vith the exception of those parts which wvere enclosed unopened in jars, and throughout its whole extent the tube exhibited no evidence of disease. The only thing remarkable was the inusually empty state ofthe stomach and bowels, there being only a very small portion of food or excrement to be seen, and that was in the commencement of the large intestine. Near the entrance tothe windpipe, far back in the throat, a rather unusual appearance presented itself, and, as such, I ought to mention it. It wsS a ,white, oval proininent substance, about the size of a filbert. I believe it wvas an cnlarged gland, and wholly unconnected with the death of the deceased, So far, therefore, as the condition of the bodyallor-eed2me to formaan opinion,I found no organic disease --n o change Of str2ct2ro sufficient to account f or death. The stomach and duodenum, portions of the large and small intestines, one kidney and a portion of the larynx and pharynxc, the liver, spleen, heart, and part of the lin's, were enclosed in three glazed earthenware jars, duly labefed aud scrured, and delivered by me into the hands of Inspector Ellis Crisp on Saturday evening, the 22d of December, 1855. The Coroner.-You made the post morl4em examination, and I believeyou have heard theprevious evidence given on tlis inquest. What, in your opinion, is the cause of death9 -In the absence of any other cause oecuring within a short tnne of death, to produce the symptoms I have heard described by the witnesses, I can form no other opinion than that the deceased died in a fit of apoplexy.

There was no appearance of disease on the surface. The kidney is the last part from which the blood is drained. I believe there was more congeston than I should have found if I had examined the body a few hours after death.

Mr. Saiith-You have heard the evidenee of the other medical men,-is it your opinion that he died from apo- lexy cused by dnnking !-From the statements I have heard that is my opinion. By Mr. Smith.-ValterPalmer exhibited much anxiety to get his life insured on more occasions than one. When Imiet him in the coenitry one day he adverted again to tIhe subject. Ho said, there was a linit to aU things, and that he thoughtIshould no longer stand in the way of his insuring his life. I remarked to him on that occasion that his appearance was greatly i2nproved, and that lie looked like lving. If a person who has had detiriumn tranens continues the exciting cause, it is natural that his death should ensue at no very remote period.

Smith said, it was a most mnatexial thing that the anxiety of poor lalter Palmer to insure his life should come out before the Court. By hlr. Deane.-I did not know at that tiue that his life was actually insured for 13,00. BeFore giving the medical certificates, Vllliam Palmer, his brother, frequently called upon me, and ones at my own solicitation. [A letter was shown to witness, which lie aclnowledged to have received from William Palmer while the certificates were being prepared. It stated that if witness had received a letter from the Solicitors and Generea Life Asranceoffice, he (Wiliam Palmer) should thank- him not to reply to it until he had seen him.] Before seeing the solicitor to one of the assurance offices I saw vlliamn Palmer. I wrote one of the certificates in his presence. Fe dictatedtome tho answers in it so far as they related to his fatlher rid mother.

Yo did not tell me on that occasion that Dr. Day had been in attendance on his brotherlValter for some tinme. I did not know that Dr. Day had been zttendina him until after he was dead. I considered, at the time I gave the certificates, that I urns WValter Palmer's medical atteadant, and if I had thought otherwise I should not have given them.

THE PEACE PROPOSALS. The ConstitutionneZ has the following- "Count Valentine Esterbazy, when he handed to Coln iesselrode a written copy of the rdtinluaturn, agreed on in concert by aU the allies, of the 2d of December, informed the Russian Cbancellor that his instractions did not antho rize him to accept any discussion of the vNineatlu nor any mnodification of its contents. If, therefore, he should receive on the 8th of January any other reply than a pure and simple acceptation, he would be under the necessity of leaving St. Petersburg with all the mnemabers of his embassy. "' To prevent this scene, and to postpone the departure of the Austrian Legation for at least a few days, the Court of Russia resolved to send its reply to Vienna direct. If an ambassador is bound by his instructions, a Minister of Foreign Afrairs is not, and Count Buol could not, at any rate, refuse to listen to the explanations of the Russian Aimbassador. "1 It was on the evening of Eriday, the 11th of January, that Prince Gortschakoff, the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, received the reply of his Government to the idtirectumt. On Saturday morning he communicated it to the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affais That reply comprised a whole system of counter-proposals which Russia wished fo substitute for the proposals she had received. " These counter-proposals were communicated by Counn Buol to the Anbassadors of France and England, and were imunediately forwarded by them to their Governments. "The reply of Russia not being the 'pure und simple! acceptation demanded from that Power, Austria could not take it into consideration without being authorized thereto by her two allies, France and Englaud. The Western Powers had no motive for giving up a decision which had been carefully considered and was irrevocable. " It was, therefore, replied to Prince Gortschak-off that, if by the 18th of January Russia did not send her pure and simple acceptation of the rultinatuw, Count Valentine 3Esterhazy and his Legation would receive orders to leave St. Petersburg. 'Irummediately afterwards Austria wil present to the Gernnan Diet, through her envoy, propositions to the effect of obtaining the armed concurrence of the Confederation in the struggte vwhich she wvill have to maintain against

COURT OF OTTEENS BENCIl. WnsTmrsrEL TA. 15 CABLON V. IBELAND. (puintS int Banco, beWfoK Lord CA3fP3ELL atid Jutices COLMMGE. G1 4= . and CROMWOrXl This was an action in which the plaintiff sough' to recover from the defendant for the value of a crossed check whichhadbeen delivered bythe plaintiff to one of his clerks, named Richard Bridmore, for the purpose of being id into Messrs. Dixon and Co.'s bank to the credit of Wevsars. Carlon and Haynes, but which the clerk had got cashed by the defendant, and converted the proceeds. 'Ihe case ^tmne before the Court on the first day of term, on a motion for a new trial, upon the ground of misdirecion, and also upon the ground that since the trial fresh evidence had been discovered. The Court had then decided the alleged point of misdirection by holding that the cheek in question, though crossed, was still a negotiable instrixnient, and that it had been properly left to the jury to say whether the defendant had taken the check ton fid4e, and given value for it. But the application was allowed to stand over, to see whether the alidavit alleging that new matter had been discovered could be amended. Wr. EDnwr JA3MS Q.C., now renewed his application, and stated that thr'plaintiff had succe ed in discovering the residence of the clerk, Richard Bridmore. At the trial the defendant stated that Bridmore came to his house, the Falcon Tavern, in Fetter-lane, for the Purpose of taking his dinner there. But the learned counsel now read an affidavit made by PFridmore, denying that statement, and declaring that he was introduced to the defendant for the purpose of playing at cards. He was in the habit of playing at carc,s there on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, and so lost upwards of 120M., chiefly to the defendant. He further stated that, on a subsequent occasion, having the check in question in his pocket, he asked the defendant to cash it; upon which the defendant's wife took the check and gave him a portion of the money. The deponent lost a portion of that money to the defendant, anda fewdays after, having received the balance, he lost the whole of it to the defendant and others in his house, and the principal portion to the defendant himnself. Lord CAMnPBEsL said, that did not show that the defendant obtainedthe check without giving consideration for it. Bridmore owed no money to the defendant when he handed over the check. Had the check been given for money lost at cards, the case would have been quite clear. But here the question vas whether at the time the defendant received the check he believed Bridmore had authority to negotiate it, and give value for it. MIr. JAHEs submitted that the evidence was stroew to show the defendant was not acting bond Jide. Indeea if Bridmore told thetruth, the defendant had perjured himself. Lord CAMPBnELL said, the learned counsel mnight take a rule. Rule nisi granted. WAnD V. TBS LAWr PROPERTY ASSUILLNCE AND TRUST SOCIETY. Mr. EDnv J AMsES, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Hawkins), moved for a rule calling upon the plaintiff to show cause why the verdict given in his favour should not be set aside, and a new trial rnted, upon the ground of misdirection. The trial took place before Lord Campbell, at Guildhall, at the sittings after last term, when it appeared that the action was brought against the law Property Assurance and Trustee Society upon a policy by which the society had garanteed the pelintiff against the criminal acts, such as larceny and embe rnent, of one J. ML Wood, the plaintiff's town traveller. The policy contained a condition that, when a liability had been incurred, notice of the same should be given to the society within six days from the time when the plaintiffdiscovered or received notice of such liabilty. Lord CQIpnPiELs-You say I ought to have directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant on the plea setting out that condition. .Mr. JAMXES said he did so. The plaintiff received notice that his traveUer had been gunilt of embezzlement on the 18th of May, when he received a letter from him admitting the fact. On the 6th of June the plaintiffwrote to the defendants informing them of their liability, and on the 12th of the same month hoagain wrote, giving them full particulars of the traveller's defalcations. - Lord CAnPBELL said, the plaintiff contended he ought to have a reasonable time to make inquiries, and that he gave the particLar.s as soon as he could. Mr. James had called upon him to direct the jury to find their verdict for the defehidants on that plea, hut he (Lord Campbell) had declined to do that, thinking that it was a question for the jury. Sfr.JA5LEs contended the notice had not been givento the defendants in due time. Lord CA' PBELL said, the learned counsel might take a rnle to show cause. Rule nit granted. ACKROYID V. GILL. 3Mr. J. AnDrsos- showed cause against a rule which had been granted, calling on the defendant to show cause why the nonsuit which had been entered should not be set aside. The action was brought against the defendant to recover a penalty which he had incurredunder the 29th section of the County Courts Act (the 9th and 10th of Victoria, c. 95) by acting as attorney for a party in a plaint in a County Cotut, he being at the same tune assistant-clerk of the Court. The question was whether the defendant was a "clerk, or other officer of the COUt" The learned 'counsel contended he was neither. B the interpretation clause, the clerks meantthe " chief clerk, or registrar ' and he could not be considered as an "officer of the court," for he vws appointed and paid by the clerk. Mr. H. HMxT Q.C, rose to support the rule, but was stopped. Lord CAMPBELL said, he was strongly inciEned to think the defendant wvas an officer of the Court under the 9th and 10th of Victoria, chap. 95. He had the saine functions and character as the other officers named. But if that was doubtful, the 13th and 14th of Victoria, a statute which was in part riutca-id, removed the doubt. It referred to the assistant clerk, as appointed under the previous act. The action was therefore well brought, and the rule must be made absolute. The other judges expressed similar opinions. Rule absolute. BAIL COURT. (Sittilgso at Msi P,iU-i, before r1?-. Justice EBnI and a Common Jury.) 5I'GILL V. KAM. Mr. Watson and Mr. Lush were counsel for the plaintif and Mir. Hawkins for the dtfendant. This was an action to recover the sum of Sol. from the defendant as the acceptor of a bill of exchange, drawn by a man named Adamnson. The defendant pleaded that he had not accepted the bill. The ulaintiffs case was this,-that Adamnson was erecting some houses at Tottenham upon some land of which Rain was the freeholder. That on a certain day, on the 21st of Augnut last, he went to the Old Bailey, where Rain and his wife were prosecuting a woman for robbing iMr Kain; he asked laiam to accept a bill for him for 501. Rain agreed to do this, and Adamson went out, bought a stamp, got a friend named Williams to draw the bill, and then returned with it to Rain, and asked him to accept it; but Kain said he was so nervous he could not write, but he would get his wife to do it, and let him have it the next morning. That on the following day he gave him the bill accepted, as he said, by his wife. Adamson then took it to a man named Rowe, who took it to a Mr. Tucker, who tbok it to the laitiff, who discounted it, charging 5. per celt.; but Tucler had charged Rowe 50L. per cant. for doing it. At subsequent times Rain had said there would be a meSss about the bill, as it was a forgery, but ultimatey admitted that the bill had been accepted-by his wgife, but with his authority. This was the miahitiff's ease, as supported ~by! the evidence of Adainson, Sowe, SFCill, and another witness. On the cross-exanination of Ada.mson, it appeared that, although he had given the jury reason to suppose that he was a master bulder lving in hi own house, yet he got jobs where he could, and lived in lodgings for which he paid 6s. a-week. He had been a bankrupt in the latter part of the lear 184, owing 700!. He did not know that any dividend ad been paid. In August, 1855, he obtained a second-class certificate. He couldnot saywhetherthe interview aboutthe bill at the Old Bailey took place in a publichouse, in the street, or at the entrance to the Old Bailey Court. The defence was, as sworn to by the defendant and his wife, that no conversation whatever about a bill took place at the Old Bailey-im6t a word was said about a bill, nor was any bill produced there.

The wife said-" Is it all right e Adamson assured her it was all right. The wife then said her daughter could write better than she could, and she told the daughter to write her father's name across thebiD. The daughter took the bil into a back room and put her father's name to it, and gave it to Adamson. On the following morning the wife and a-Miss White went down to Tottenhain and met Rain, who asked if any one had been.

COURT OF EXC=EOUJER. TuID~AY. Jx.s 15. T7TEART. nT.V (:TbAl AT. V TlTrfl _Thr1- (SUiml, in Banco.) This was a special case, arising out of an action brought by the noble plaintiff to try the question whether he had the exclusive right of shooting over a district called Bretherdalebank in the county of Westinorland. The first count of the declaration was in trespass to the land, and for pursuing, killing, and taking away grouse and other game there; the secon wasin trover for dead grouse of the plaintiff; and the third was in case for the disturbance of the plaintiff's exclusive right of shooting and kI-inggouse on thetocuzs in The defendant pleaded, first, to the whole tdeclaration, '"Nt Guilty; seeondly, to the first comut, that the land was not the land of the plaintiff; thirdly, to the first count, that the land was the close soil and freehold of the defendant; fonthly, to the third count, a traverse of the plaintiff's exclusive right of shooting and killing grouse on Bretherdale-bank. The case was argued .in Trinity Tenn, last, by Wr. Iugh Hill, for the plaintiff, and Mr. Grant for the defendant, when the Court took time to consider the various points raised for their decision on the following facts .- The plaintiff is the lord of the immemorial manor of Brether<ale, and the bank is a tract of enclosed stinted pasture land extending over 508 acres and adjoininig Bretherdale waste or common, from which it is divided by a fence. Bretherdale-bank has always been subject to S0 customary rights, called " czatlegates, " or " beast-grasse, " the ouwners of which repair the fences of the bank in proportion to the number of cattlegates possessed by them. The plaintiff is owner of one cattlegate, which descended to him from one of his ancestors, who seised it quouosqgC, and of others which he has himself acquired by purchase. The defendant is scised of four cattlegates as a customary estate of inhleritance. Over this districttheplaintiffand his ancestors have immemorially exercised the exclusive right of sporting as lords of the manor, but lately the defendant has clainsed the right of sporting concurrentlv with tle lord, and on the 12th of August, 1S52, he entered the bank and shot two brace of grouse thereon. Each cattlegate confers on its owner the right of depasturing one head of cattle on the bank froni the 26th of May to the 24th of April in every year, and an unlimited quantity of sheep from the loth of October to the 24th of April in every year, and from the 24th of April to the 26th of May nicither cattle nor sheep can be depastured thereon; and the owners of the cattlegates elect an officer called the "Frithmnan" to supeitend thleserights. By an act of the 46th George I1L power w.as given to the then lord and his succeassors to enifran. chis~e, and under it several of these cattlegates have enfsanchised. The caWegates have alvays been heldof the lord of the manor of Bertherdale according to the custom t:ereof, as a customary estate of inheritance, by payment of a fine, and certain small rents of right accustodMed; and they descend by the custom, on the death of an o, ner, t his heir at law, who is admitted tenant at the lord's court. They also pass by customary deed, followed by admittance at the nest court. Uder these facts thequestionssub mitted to this Court wecre-first whether the plaintiff could maintain the p resent action against the defendant for shooting at, kIdlling, or carring awvay the said grouscsecondly, in what manner the verdict ought to be entered. The learned judes who heard the argunents, not being unanimous, now dehvcred their judgments seriof tih . Mfr. Baron lEnsoT was of opinion that there was not sufficient evidence set forth to wvarrant him in giving any judgment on the question fhether the plaintiff had the ex clusive right of shooting over the banlmt he was clearlyof opinion that, as lord of the manor, upon the facts set out, he was entitled to the soil, and consequently to the possessory title in the game there found and killed. He, there: fore, conldered that the action was well brought, and that the verdilt ought to be entered,accordingly. a ir. Baron Pn was of opinion that the plaintiff was enffUed generally to the jud gbrent of thee on al points. Mir. Baron Aces SON was oE opinion that the plaintiff could not maintain the action oftrespass, and that the owners of the cattlegate, being the ooners of the soil, had a right of sheeting over Bretherdale-bank, and that the lord of the manor, d lord, had no right to interfere. As to the second point, there was no dioferuce of opinion, ras it was agreed en allhlandsthat the plaintiff hadno right tothegrouse independent of the soil; and, as to the third point, lie agreed with sr. Baron Martin that there was no - suficient evidence of an exclusive right of shooting over the bank, as advanced by the plaintiff. The learned baron, having concluded his judgment, aunounced that the Chief Baron, who had also heard the argument, having read dlC the judgments now delivered, had expressed an intention to adopt his (hr. Baron tArdbeson's), and that in the result no judgmlent at al could be pronounced. upnder these circumstances, it was suggested that steps should be taken to bring the case within the operation of'the Common Law Procedure Act, which could only be by consent of parties, so that the ease might bestken to a Court of Error. Theslearned cousel who were present were understood to intihate that they would confer with their respective clients. NEW TrIL'L PADEfl. IE V. BISSEL--LEE V. BORDb CAIiDTGAK.

PREROGATlvIV COUT. JT. 1. SCOULAR V. PAlWOP.Ti ANbD PrLOwnTe.Tcm' (1efore Sir J. DODsOx.) This wan a business of bringing into a!nd Mleaving i'nZthe regista the last will and testament of Mr. William Scoulhr, late o Dean-street, Soho, bearing date the 12t o JuOlTy, 1854, and of propounding the same; otherwise, of showig cause why letters of administration should naot be granted to Mr. George Scoular, the brother and only next of kin of the deceased. Thie suit was promoted by Air. G1. Scolula agains t Xi. Pa p orth and Mr. Flowright, the executors named in the 'wil which has since been propounded by Mr. Plo 'ht, in a short allegation. The Lceased, it appeared, was a sculptor, and left behind him a brother and two cousin s.He dies on the 23d of July, 31 days after the execution of the will aged 60. His personal yroperty amounted to about 4,0001., including his stock-rn-trade, valued at 3,000!. By his 'wil be gave to 3Marchetti, one of his workman, 10! - to Miaspoli, another worman, 50l. to each of his executors, 501.; to Dr. f. A. Edward, who Liad recently entered into partnership with him, his share of the stock-in-trade and the fixtures on the p,remi_es; and then divided the residue between Mr. Edwards and 3Mr. Hay, who had resided in his house and aced as his amanuensis. EFom 1839 to 1844 the testator had been in partnershiAwith a person named Loft, and on its termination, feariDgi that he might be robbed by the people about him, attempted to dispose of his business, but the arm ents were broken off. He had been acquzanted with Mr. Edwards. for some time, andl on entering into the partnership that gentlemuan lived in the house of the deceased, and obtained for him a nurse. Marchetti had been 35 years it his service, and, with the assistance of a charwoman, had acted as cook and attendant. Mlaspoli had resided with him 31 years. lir. Papworth vwas an old friend of the deceased's when at Rome, and MÂ£r. Plowright wvas a solicitor, acting, as alleged on one side, for the firm, and en the other for Mr. Edwards alone. It was contended on tie -part of Mr. G. Scoular that the will had been obtained l.y Mr. Edwards by undue influence wheni the deceased was in -a s(ate of bodily and mental prostration and unable to ut-. derstand its purport. Dr. Jxss: (Mwith whom was Dr. Spinlcs) submitted that the will was clearly proved to have been executed by the deceaxed when he was of perfect sound mmid, memory, and undertanding. It was attested by no less than four witnesses who took no benefit under it. The'case set up on the other iide WSS, not that be was incapable of making a wil, t tatbkemgbtbieadctednpon by desiging person Thb c1=rge'of undue influence entirely failed. His caacity was carried up by Mr. George Scoular to the 22d of Julv when instructions wem obtaied from him for a now; but which was not executede Dr. HAGGAED (with whom was the Admiralty Advocate) said that the will propounded was admitted to be in the handwriting of fr. Edwards, who was largely benefitted under it. There wras no recognition of it by the deceased. All the circumstances which took place subsequently to the 12tlh of July had very littlo bearilg on the question at issue. The law cast the onus upon tr. Edwards of showing that the testator hada competent kmowledge of the contents of the instrument, andthatit coincided withhis intentions to beneft him tothe extent done in the wilL. That onus had not been discharged, and hie therefore prayed the Coart to pronounce against the wvill and condemn llr. Edwards in. thle costs. The learned JuDGo said, it did not appear when the decemsed's brother and his other relatives had had any corniunication withhimn. What intercourse had taken place between themn ws left entirely in the dark. Itappeared from the testimony givenby Mr. Edwards that the xeceased sent for him and gave him instructions for the will. Mr. Edwards desired thatea solicitor should be employed, but the deceased, who was represented to himto be a miser, objpcted to it on the ground of expense. Mr. Edwards, with the assstance of xr. Hay, then drew up the will. Unless M1r. Edwards had deposed falsely, the will was drawn according to the instrctions of the deceased, ard was after. wards read over to him. The attesting witnesses were sent for by the testator, who retained his capacity down to a much later date than the wilL A ease of duress had been set up in opposition to the will, but had not been substantiated. The Court sas of opinion that the will was sufficiently proved, and the only qseshon was as to the costs. It was a ease in which the brother had a full right to put the executors upon proof of execution, and, had the investigation been linited to the cross-examination of the attesting witnesses, he might have been entitled to his costs out of the estate. But an allegation had been given in charging fraud, the averments in which had not been proved. He would, therefore, pronounce for the will, and condemn Mr. Scoular in the costs froin the time of giving in his allegation.

POLICE. MAWIOb-IOIHSE.--Thomas Stevenson was brought before the LonD MAYoR, charged with having forged an accept ance for 35. and with having obtained goods underfalse pretences. M1r. Metcalf appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Wontner for the defence. Mr. W. Allen Turner, of Wood-strcet, Cheapside, manager of the South London Indiarubber Company, said,About the end of September, or the beginning of October last, I sold to the prisoner some goods, at different times, to a small amount,and after I received information that references had been given to me respecting him. He had asked for discount, and we agreed to give him a monthly account, In December last I had a communication from Mr. Devas, but I had previously received a reference in November, and then it Avwas I sent for the prisoner, and told him I was very much surprised that ho should take the liberty to apply to us, and that he might have told us he was going to do so ; and, as he had done so, Iwas desirous to know what Ids means were and how long ho bad been in business at Chatham. He replie that he had 4001L when he started in business, and that he had been at Chatham about six months. I said, "You must satisfy mi by other means that you really had 4007." HE then referred me to Messrs. Duckworth and Co., carcass butchers in lNewgate-mark-et, who, he said, knew him exceedingly wel, and ,ould eatisfy me that h1is nife would have 5,000!. on the death of a very old lady. I wrote to Du.ckwvorth and Co., and received from them a letter, ansd afterwvards I told the prisoner that it was not sufficently satisfactory as to the 400, and he must give me some further reference. He then referred me to is ather, who he said vwould fully satisfy me as to my question. He gave the namle and addres Joseh Stevenson, farmier, Aflerthorpe," and I wrote to his father on the 26th of November by tbat address, and afterwards received a letter, which I produce, and which I showed to the prisoner. IIt Is as followis: "Allerthorpe, Nov. 22, 1833. Sir,-In answer to your letter, my son at Chatham had 4001. of his own money to commence business, and he will have a little more some time. "Yours respectfully, ".JOS. STEVEsSOSe." It was after that I received the communication from. Messrs Devas's clerk, and I then showed him the letter purporting to come from the prisoner's father. The prisoner never suggested that I should show that letter to Mlessr. Devas or anybody else. He knew the object I had in !making these inquiries. I told him, ia the presence of Mtessrs. Devas's clerk, that I wrote to him because I thought he was going too fast with a capital of only 4001. at startng. Cross-examined by 3ilr. Wontner.-He has paid me every thing he owed. The last amount vws 71., and he owed 25& and other amounts before that. He had a running account I when I received the letter from his father, which he has paid since. The last parcel of goods w-ere had in the early part of December. The total of his dealings amounted to about 601. IRe-examined.-He gave his references to ns withouit our consent, and we made the inquiries in consequence of the references. Seven or eight persons came in one day to us iwith references, which quito alrmed me. They were given to highlyrespectable fams. We were satisfied with him ourselves, and trusted him; but we made the inquiries in order to see if we wvere justiHied in satisfying the firms3 which had been referred to us. Mr. John Squibb, clerk to Messrs. Devas and Co., Cannon-street-west, warehousemen, said,--In December last I received instructions from our chief clerk, and made inquiries at the countinghouse of the last witness, and the letter purporting to come from his father was shown to me. Myobject in going was to make inquiries as to the prisoner's respectability, and in consequence of what lr. Turner said I directed goods to be sent to the prisoner. I should not have done so without seeing this letter, and that induced me to give the repert upon which the goods were sent. They consisted of drapery goods to the amount of uwa.rds of | oO. Our terms were at one month, and 2!1 discount. Cross-examined by Mr. 'Wontner.--The goods would be due in the beginning of February. We should not have been satisfied with the reference to Mr. Turner, on account of the amount of business he had done with that gentleman, nor should we have been satisfied with the lenth of time he had dealt with 3Mr. Turner without some further information. Henry Elche3, picture framemal-er and gilder, 2, Phcenixstreet, oho-square, said-I was inthe service of the prisoner as a shopman. About the 1st of September he came to me itand asled me where I thought would be a good place to go into business. I told him Chathana, I thought, would be a good place, and -we went to Chatham and got a shop, but could not get credit, and the shop was not opened then. About three weeks afterwards he came to me again and said he had succeeded in gettinr 50. thron' a bill drawn upon his relations, Zis wife's brother, and he invited me to go to his house in Truro-street, Bromp. stead. He said ho did not like Chatham, and he would like to -o to Brighton. I told him the amount was too small to suit Brighton as we)l as Chatham. He, however, said he should go to Brighton. He told me that he drew the bill, and his wife accepted it. I toMd him that he must be very careful what he was about as I knew a man who washung forthe samething. tAlaugh,) I mentioned the name of the. man as flunten. Me said he had not the least fear, even if his relations knewv of it, as they would not take any notice. His wife was -present at the time. He said he got the cash for the bihhfrom Mr. Duckworth. I went with the prisoner to Brighton about the midde of September, but we did not succeed, and I left himn there with hiis wvife. Afterwards I went with them to Chatham, and we 'took possession of the shop about the - 1th of October, and the prisoner andl c ame up to London to endeavour to get credit, but as the references were to Mr. Duckworth we did not suceeed. I told him he had no chance of getting credit, except upon references or by paying cash, and he saiad he had 25!. left out of the cash, and went with him to different houses-to Townsend, in Wood-street, Rtichards and Co., and others. I think he laid out about 51. with each of them, and with the goods we went dowu and oened the shop, but we did not sell sudicient te keep the'honse. I went out to different markets, but could not sell much. We got a, profit if we eould, bTut were obliged to raise money on the goods to keep the house. (A laughL) I was sent up to London several weeks running to try to get credit for goods, but I did not succeed. The last time was about the 15th of November. On the 20th of November I met the prisoner ini Farringdon-street, and he told me that he had been to Iichards and Co., (the Indiarubber Company) to endeavour eoget thento -ve hium a reference, as he coula not get it at Duckworth's. Se said they would not-give him a reference urdess he convinred them that he had, ashehad sttedtothexn, 4d whemahe commencd busines in Chathm. He ;said the only way he could satisfy them was that they could write to his Tether, and that they were going to do so by that very nexs. post. He said he had given his father's address as a farmer at Allerthorpe, whereas he was only a butcher, and, consetquzently,lesho ozdhave to write down.to the pos-tmaster,as there wasa farmer of the name of Stevenson at Allerthorpe. The prisoner wrote to the postimster iin mvy presence, and 'ho said'he should t'hen go down to bis.fither ad get him to' answer the letter sat&isfctorliy, and if, his father did not anuaer it he should answer it himsef. I asked him for a little money, and he a le had not got any and, in fact, he should hayc to go dom to Chatham to rise soney t4 go to his fathe-. He tbn give mo , and I left him. (LAughter. Afterwards I saw him agsin on the 5th of December, and he told me his father was ready to kick him ontof doors for. askdn him to answer the6 efttr. Isaid, '"Youdidnotdoiti? Hesaid, "Certainlynot." I aekedhim if his father had answeredit. Hesaid, "Io," anidhe-wastryingto get abill discounted'for -.or38L, but Mr. Duckworth would not do it. I walkel about vith hin some time, andl advised him to go down among his relatiorns and mnake the billthat was due right, and after that I never saw him till now. I know his writing, and firmly believe that the letter produced, purporting to come from his father, is hishandwriting. The prisox,er was remanded till Friday. GUUMHAtL.-Woog Javal, a middle-aped foreigner, described in the chage-sheet as an optician, of No. 13, Broad-street-buildings, was charged with ulawfully conwpiring with Eriest Theophile Gofget, at preeent under rem,and, and others not in custody, to -obtain large qusn- tities of goods to the value of over 10,0001. under false pre- 1 tences, with intent to defraud Mr. Sleyffers, of Paris, andvarious merchants and tradesmen of this country. There was aLso a chargeagainat the prisoner of receivingp goods and deliver warrants, well knowaing then to have been fraudulently obtained. &r. abras attended for the prosecution, and mr. Lewis appeared for the prisoner. Sir P. AuliE said, he had read the report of the first past of this case in that morning's paper, and he thought Mr. Abrahams should have left it tothe magistrate to say if the parties complained of were swindlers or not. At all events, he oughtto prove the fact before he stigmatized them as such. Mr. Abrahmns said, he was prepared to g evidence to connect the piisoner with the same gang who were carrying on their operations in Dublin, under the name of " Duncan and Co.," and in London under that of -"Marice and Co." At some future period he would show that the prisoner was also connected with a bankrupt who had abseonded from his labilitieg. At present he only proposed to prove that the prisoner had applied for some of the goods which had been fraudulently obtained, and which were detained at the railwa station. 8ui . LAUSUE inquired if the gang alluded to consisted of Enlislunen or foreigners? ml Abrabams said they were all foreigners. Sir P. L&wR said, it really appeared to hin that it would 1 be r ecessasy to have an interpreter attached to this court,! to be constantly in attendance, as, from the gteat increase1 of foreigners in this country, it seemed that the police-courts would neverbhe without th em. He had a return of the nw-nber of foreign offenders last year, and it was truly. alauming to see the extent to which they had carried on. their nefarious practices in this country. The following evidence was then gone into )Mr. J. Gilleard said,-I ani the chief correspondenit in the establishment of Messrs. Chapln and Home, railway carriers, at the Camden-town station. We have goods lNirg at our wharf in the name of "I Duncan and Co." We received an invoice and one case of goods described as funiture on or about the 23d of December last. The invoice wvs signed "C. D. and Co.," as coming from Duncan and Co., of Dublin. On the26thof Decemberwe had consig-ned to the order of Duncan and Co., of Dublin, nine cases of goods described as British wine, twvo cases marked " F. goods,"2 which I presurnz means foreign goods, one case of namps, and two cases of goods not described. All these cases are now at the Camden-town station, and came from Dublin. Any one offering the three receipts I now produce would be entitled to receive those goods, and we shoula have delivered them unless we had any suspicions. On the Sth of the present monthwe received a telegraphic message from our ajent in Dubhin, instracting us not to part with the -oods consigned by. Duncan and Co. On the following day a man caed -with a conveyance card, as if coming from Hardwick and Jones, Custom-house agents, and presented these three receipts; hut we declned to deliver the goods, and we subsequently received through the post a communication pur- potigtobe'i6edby the prisonerand..ddressedto Messrs. j hapnadHIorne.

MARYIMBOYE.-A well-dressed young mn4, living in Princess-street, Portman-market, was charged with having coimmitted a mostviolent assault upon his wife, to whom he had been married only four months. ConplAinant, whose left eye was much discoloured and swroUen, expressed a di3inclination to give any evidence. Mr. B:OUGhTOar desired that she should be sworn, which was accordingly done, and her statement was to the effect that on the previous evening she returned home, having been absent for some hours with her mother, and that, on her going downstairs in order to find a bag wvhich she had left at her motber's, she was followed by the prisoner; who seized hold of her dress, which he tore almost to pieces, and gave hor atremendous blow upon the evevith his fcst, vhich knocked herdown, She bad been married to him onlyfour months, and at the peiod of their union slhe kept a toy and stationer's shop in Church-street. She sold off all the goods and she and her husband had been ever since livin,-npon the proceeds. The mother of complainant said that the prisoner was a lazy fellow and did not strive to get into a situatiorn Jeran> 2l5D, by whom the prisoner was taken into custody, said that when he was called into the house complainant WaS bleeding profusely from the eye and her dress was almost in tatters, The prisoner expressed his sorrow for what had occarred. MIr. BlOlGPTOX considered that it wvas a case in which he must pass a severe sentence, and oommitted the prisoner to hard labour in the House of Correction for four months. CIERUIVE1LI-William Reid, a brutal-looking fellow, upwards of six feet high and of powerful dimensions, w-io was described in the police-sheet as a bricklayer, 31 years of age, of 2, Cambridge-crescent, Agar-town, St. Panc:as, was placed at the bar before Mr. CoBBn: charged with having violently assaulted Ann Beid, his wife, 27 years of age. The prosecutrix, a fline-lool'ing woman, was supprted into court in a most horrid condition, her eyes ingblaek ened and swollen, her nose brok-en, and her face and person otherwise covered with bruises, &c. Hav ben sworn, with great difficulty she said,-On Saturday evening last I wvent th the prisoner, my husband, marketing. While we were together he drank three glasses of rum. We retrnedhome. He quarlled with me, when le locked the door and commenced beating and kickn gme. He knocked me down, and while I was down he kicked me on the head andbody. I got out of the room and escaped from the prisoner, and took refage in a neighbours house. I am much injured and under medical attendance. By Mr. CoBRR -He has frequently ill-used me before, butI forgave him on account of my family. I have three chsildren; the eldest, a boy, 8 years of age;* a girl, 5; and a little boy, 3 years of age, The prisoner Is in the habit of earning constantly SOs. per week from the Regent's Canal Company, both in winter and suommer. He w,as drunk at the tHme. Mr. ComR= (to the prisoner)-What have you to say to such brutal conduct? Prisoner.-I w;as drunk, and I hope you will be lenient with me. 1r. CoRBIE.-How is it possible that I can be lenient, wIeen?you have kicked and beaten your poor wife in theway you have done? Thomsas Rolway, 338, S division, said that onSaturay night the prosecutrix CamUe to him horribly disfigutred and covered with marks of violence, complaining of her husband's ill-treatment. He had left her, and she wvas protected in a neighbour's house, where he aferwards found her. W-itness apprehended him on Monday night, and he seas locked upuntil yesterdaymorning, when he was brought to this court. *Witiess added that the wife P,-as obliged to crawl into the back yard and climb over a wall, after having concealed herself in a closet in order to save her life and escape from the prisoner's violence. Sergeant Mulverney, 8 S, produced the follo-wing medical cerhafcatel " 1 Judd-place east. "I hereby certify I have visited Ann Reid, and that I found her suffering from injuries she had received from blows and heks given to her by her husband. She hadblack eyes and small wound on the forehead, the face swollen and discoloured. She complained of being kicked all over the left hip, which disabled her from walking. " JxArs Saur aL , Surgeon."

Mr. Corrie questioned the poor wife as to the means which the prisoner had allowed her for the support of herself and family.

Besides, the prisoner gave a false address, and, under al the cirunistances 3 the case was one, in his opinion, requiring the opinion of a jun, and he slhouid therefore send it for triaL. It was here found that there was not a witness, in attendance from the Bank of England, and as it is necessary, though the note itself is stamped " forgery," that the fact of its being so, on the oath of a competent vitne&s, slould appear on the face of the depositions, the prisoner sagi remanded for the attendance of the additional witne="r The magistrate refused to admit him to hail. The magistrate's notice wvas directed to two chlldren brought tothe court by a poor woman who has been-for a shorL time living in the ssue house with them,- and whose appearance, and more particularly one of therS; was of the most pitiable description.

The Colossus, SO, screw ship, Captain the Hon. lienry ECeppel, had her-loiwer deck cleared of guns, carriages, &c., at Portsmouth yesterday, to enable her to find stowage xoom for stores for the di-ision of gunboats to be commanded by Captain Keppel in the alltic. The PigPy steamerlwas at Spithead all day yesterday, endeavomring to raisethe Rev. Mr. Berthon's niortar raft. The weather was much smoother than the day before, and the object Will probably be attained at another attempt. lThe crew of the London, 90, Captain A.

Righb at thc east end of Wool. wich DocLk ard, and wlhich has been 12 months in the course of construction, is now completed. This slip has been built oan a scale sufficiently spacious. to obviate the difficulty hitherto experienced in WVoolwich Dockyard-namely, of building slhips of large burden. This new slip contains suflicknt space for all the purposes of building men-of-war ,of the largest tonnage. Its diraensions are 280 feet length, with a proportionate breadth. As it is essential in itructures of tlis description that the foundation and floorin,g of thte shipway should be solidly secured, the foundation has been sunk to a considerable deDth, a bed of concrete from 10 to 12 feet in thickness forming the lower stratum, which rests on the chalk rock. This substance is covered by a body of brickwork. The floor of the buildiug consists of large blocks of maonry 15 inches in thickness The masonry and brickwork are set in cement. A portion of the river wall, in coinnexion with the above, is likewise completed. This important addition to the dockyard at Woolwich has been carried out under the general superintendence of Mr. Bourneys, the clerk of the works. Her Majesty's paddlewlieel steamer Merlin, Captain Sullivan, will have completed lher repairs by the end of the vweek. Her machinery has been refitted, and she has commnenced receiving her spare gear. She is to be again employed in operations, as sooa as the season opens, on the Baltic coast. The William, schooner, 'of Goole, is embarking from Woolwich arsenal a cargo of mixed shot for Portsmouth; and is likewise shipping two 13-inch mortars and mortar weds, with two eight-inch guns, for the Scahorse, Her Majesty's steamer Coquette, 4 guns, 700 tons burden, lately built at Blackwall, receives her crew and a detachment of Royal Marines, whicl are being transferred fronm the Salsette, at Woolwich. The Admiralty yacht Black Eagle get up her steam yesterday moning in Woolw ich basin to test her machinery. The Tartarus has been comtaissioned, andfis also in a forward state for service. It is contemplated to raise the willsot tre artillerystables an the north side of Brompton Barracks, for the purpose of making additional rooms for the accommodation of the Royal Sappers and Miners. It is supposed that the alterations wiiU cost 20,0007. The anrual meeting of the Soldiers' Compassionate Fund will be held this day at the office of the Brigade-M3ajor, Chathanm, the object of which fiud is to give assistance to the wives of those soldiers who are niot permitted to accompany them on foreign service, as well as to afford relief to women whose husbands are in hospital.

Surgeon to the 3fedical Staff Corps, vice Second-clas Surgeon Alexander Knox, SD., retired fromn the service. The iron floating battery which R. Napier and Sons have comzienced to build at Glasgow, and are to complete by the middle of April, is to be about 200 feet long, with a breadth of 45 feet, and a depth of 16 feet. Stein and stern are to be alike, and the form of the hull is not one calculated for quick sailing. The bottom is flat, and without a keel, so s' to float in as little water as poesible. The bilges are full, and the topsides tumble in considerably. There are to be two decks, on the lower of which' the armament will be placed, consisting of 20 guns of the largest cahbre. The lull wdi be built of iron in the usual way, but between decks will be lined with teak-wood 6 inches thuck-, and the outside protected with iron plates about4 inches thick, so as to render the sides shot-proof, and secure the men at the guns from the effects of pointblank shot. The drauglt of water, when ready for sea, is expected to be about 8 feet, hut it will probably be more. The measurement tonnage Will be about 2,000; and the propelling power is a screw, actuated by non-condensing engines of 200-horse power. essrs-.

MiITMABYEDUCATIO.N. fL.-, To TO E rI)ITORr OF TEI TDIEM Sir,-1r. Cliffe Leslie, Profesor of Jurisprudence and Political Economy mn the Queen's College, Belfast, and Examiner inl the same in the Queen's University in Ireland, has been so good as to for-. ward to ine a copy of a lecture recently delivered by him on " The Military Systems of Europe Econonically Conisidered." I have read his work with much ploasure and profit, and I will, with your per- - ission, call the attention of the public to-day to such portions of it as bear upon the subject of free anld equal competition for all classes in the race for muilitary rewvards. In the last letter which I had the honour of addressing to you I showed you the Duke of Wellington's analysis of the componient parts of the British arny-the rank and file trepamied, as it wvere, froni the lovest and loosest of the lowver class; the oflicers appointed, without selection or instruction, from the least educated of tle upper class-the entire machine only to be worked effectively, according to the Duke, by dint of iron severity, and therefore unpopuilar vith all classes. " Young volunteers," says Adam Smith, "1 never enlist so readily as at the beginning of a new war; and thougli they have scarce any chance of prefenrient, they figure to themselves in their youthful fancies a thousand occasions of acquiring honour and distinction -which never occur." Accordingly, when our troops first sailed for the East the recruitinig sergeants found little difficulty in plying their calling with success. But the case is far different now. Lord Eardinge stated pubEcly nny months ago " thaat full-grown men would no longer enlist ;" that the Horse Guards could only obain boys, " mere gristle," and not enough of t hen. Hie gave it as his opinion that it would be nseless to increase the rate of bounty, as such a step would certainly increase the number of deserters; and ve knlow that the pay of the private soldier has been augmented instil its amount has almost endangered the discipline of the armny. In spite of all this outlay, Great Britain, at the presen.t moment with a popuLation execeeding 0,000,000-wagingr a just, necessary, and popular wrar-finds herself unable to maintxain a contingflent of 100,000 fighting men, without scouring Europe, Asia, and even America for assistance. We have Anglo Turkish, Swviss, Italian, and German legions; we have Bashi-Bazouks without stint in our pay; but somehow or other we scem fearful of making, use of our motley allies. Surely there must be something radically vicious in a military system which drives a rich and powerful nation to such shifts-as these. M?r. Leslie clearly points out what that vice is. It is the exclusion of the be*t of the lower classes .and of the -whole of then middle classes from the military service of the coiuntry. Those classes may, indeed, if thev please, enlist as comnnon soldiers; but, if they do, they do so know,in that lionours and rewards are not for them, no matter tat thteir zeal, intelligence, and gallantry may be. If they survive disease and shot, and finally receive, int commnon with every othermanin the army, a medal or a clasp, conferred indiscriminately on the worst as on the best soldier, they may consider themselves more fortunate than their Peninsular predecessors; if, in mature manhood, they reach the position of ensigns of regiments of the line, they are indeed highly rev-arded; and if they obtain in their old age barrack-masterships in Ireland or the colonies, or Poor Knighthoods of Windsor, they become as Field-Marshlals among the ordinary run of officers promoted for their merit from the ranks. It is very clear that attractions suich as these must plove utterly insufficient to induce classes from among which thee ranks of ouir men of science and art are almost entirelyrecruited-whichconstruct our canals and railways-which design, build, and sail our merchant navy-which invent, manufacture, and work our wondrous steam machinery-" to separate themselves, perhaps for ever, from 31 that is dear to tlhem on earth, to peril life and limb, to undergo indescribable hardships and sufferings, and for ten long years, if they live so long, to forfeit all the liberty so precious to British citizens." We have tried in vain all means to induce these valuable men to enlist under our banners, save one; and that one is the most obvious. It is to abolisi the monopoly of promotion w hich his ow enjoyed by the upper class; in the wfords of M,r. Leslie, " to give extraordinary honour to extraordinary merit, even in the private soldier, and thins to attract extraordinary merit into the ranks." "'Carnot,' said Napoleon, 'I has organized victory. It was his maxim that nothing vwas so easy as to find officers in al ranks, if they were only chosen according to their capacity and courage. For this reason he took the utmost Pains to make himself acquainted with their names and characters, and such was the extent of his observation and inforrnation that it was rare for a soldier of merit to escape him, thiough onlya simple private. Ie deemed it impossible that an army commanded by officers chosen exclusively from a limited class of society should long sustain a conflict with one led by men chosen with discernment from tae inferior ranks. Such commanders as Turenne and Conde seemed too rare to be cadculated upon wvith any degree of certainty from a particular class, while the muine of talent that lay hid in the lower stages of society presented inexhaustible resources.' " Upon these maxims Sir Archibald Alison, at lea- a sufficiently Conservativehistorian, snmakes thefollowing comment: -' This Principle, being founded on the eternal laws of nature, is of universal application, and when once arm.es have been organized and thoroughly disciplined on this footing they never can ba suciessfuly resisted bat by troops in who-the -ame military virtues have been developed and Popularpassions equally general called forth. Supposing the abilities of the higher orders of society to be equal to those of an equal number in the inferior, it is impossible tisatthey can ever produce .as great a ian of talent as will emerge, on a free competition, from the numerous ran -c- of their humbler competitors. A hundred thousand men can never produce as many energetic characters as ten millions.' " This argument seems to me to ba unanswerable. I can add nothing to its force, nor do I think it possible to takse anYthing from it. The question is not whether we have not already good officers and soldiers in our army; it is whether we cannot have more of them without more cost-whether our rmilitary system cannot be improved, and wvhither tho numbers and class of our recruits do not prove an alteration to be desirable, if not imperiously necessary." (Zcslie, p.23.) In the following page Mr. Leslie thus deals with the objection that "birth" is necessary to constitate an efficient officer:_ "This nation has cordially ratified the principle that the civil offices of the State should be won by merit. It has long since assigned station and rankc to eminent industrial and literary genius. Why should an anomalous obstacle be opposed to the display and exercisa of military talent? Is birth more essential, or is merit less, to enable a man to discharge the duties of a colonel or a general than of a judge or a state-uman? * * t * * " Is it said, or thought, by any one that the soldier vill not respect the officer who ws once his equal? Perhaps so, if promotion from the ranks occur seldom or never, as the phrase is; certainly not, if it cease to be infrequen' or strange. Does any barrister feel any want of respect to a Lord Chancellor or judge of humbler parentage than his orn ? or, if he does, ought his prejudices to overcome merit, or to be overcome by it ?" I do not profess in these meagre extracts to have done justice to MIr. Leslie's very able lecture; I have merely selected such palts as seen, to me to bear most directly on the subject to which I have been calling attention. MIr. Leslie points out the propriety or establishing public institutions at which the poor as vell as the rich may be enabled to cultivate and develope for the service of +.l" country thle natural abilities with which God has endowed them. He observes that- " Domninations for comrnisions in the armysboMd not be like those for University honours. Short-sighted senior wranglers and sicldy classicalscholars may be the pride of British science and literature, and yet be every way unfit to command thesoldiersof aBritisharnny. The mainprinciple according to which an examination of non-com ission.d officers for a commision should be constructed is, that it should be such as to test practically the ability of the sol. dier to dischargo the duties of an officer in the field and vith the pen. It is better that they should be able to take a regiment in good order ont of a wood or a difficult pass than that they should be able to interpret a transcendental equation, or a formula in hyperdeterminants. It is better that they should be able to write a good mslitary despatch than that they should be able to scan, at fist sight, every line of Truencc." All this is -sound sense; yet I cannot but tlink that the fears whlich many people cxptess, and from 'vhich Mfr. Leslie seems not altogether free, that oiur army may come to be efficered by short-sighted 'and scrofulousmathemiaticians and flaccid andspirit- Ilcs first-class men, are altogether superfluous. The mere fact of a man endowed with good abilities, successfully cultivated, dezirinb to be a coldier -aprofeirTonluwhich the peoiiaypri3'remode rate, and th, risaks to lifo and limb great-w!ien thr same abilities *ould certainly insure hi'm a couipc'tence in miany a safer and easier walk of life; is to my milnd a suflicient Lunrantee that none but the ambitious and the bold would turn their thoughta that way. At plresent we know that iiatiy have sought and are leading an officer's life who are neither ambitious nor bold, and who would gladly escape from it if they could do so with honour; but these nmen lhave generauLy adopted it in peace time as an idle and showvy career in which neither knowledge nor ener,y was necessary-hi wvhich they would in duo time rise to high cmunmaid ivithout either merit or exertion of their own. Mioreover, nothing can be easier than so to arrango cxaminations for admission and promotion as to insure a fair share of bodily as well as mental vigour to the successfiul candidates. In F-rance, while a ccrtait2 nrumber of marks are assigned t, mathmlatics, military history, fortification, &sc., we also find a proportionate number. given to "ecqu2itation," to " escr3me," and even to ' natation." r. Leslie sugg,ests, in conclusion, the establishment of a sp ecial order of merit,-not necessarily implying high milit ary talent,-suclh as exists both in the French and llussian armie, as a means of rew arding brave and good soldiers whlo are unfit for higher promotion. The Duke of Wellington a quarter of a century ago stated before the Military Commission that he was certain such a distinction would ba most boneficial, andthat the British soldier would appr-ciate it highly; dp to the present momentnothing has been done in the matter, and yet we contimie to deplore aud wonder at the unpopuIarity of oiur military service with the lower classes. Tie following anecdote, whichl I heard from the lips of the officer in command, wvill show the sort of cascs in which sulch an institution woould be advantageous A comipany of the -th Regiment were posted in one of the most advanced t.enches before Sebastopol. The fire of the Russians was unusually biting. OneC of the twvo officers in the trenclh was badly wounded in the shoullder, a non-cominssioned officer and nine of thec mlen wvere hit with Mini6 bullets. The enemy's riflemen so completely coIIImanded the only ro;ad to the rear that it appeared to be certain dleath to attempt it in daylight. Nevertheless the wotunded officer-an active ladpreferred the ris' k of being again hit to blecding- to death in the trench. He made a ran for his j life, and escapcd. The other wounded meon were dealt with iu the trench by their conmrades as best. tley couild. After a while two men of, I think, the 6Sth Regiment stole up iunder shelter as near the trench as they could, and then "doubled" across the open, undera fiuriouis fire from the Russians. They nevertlieless got safe in, and off'ered to try and carry the noncommissioned officer, wlhose case was the worst, to the surgeon. So he was laid on a stretcher, and the hvo volunteer sallied fortlh ith their biuden into the hot fire; but they had not gone ten steps before the foremost ma n fell dead, shot througlh the brain. The stretcher anid the wounded mian rolled on the gronld, and the surviving volunteer threw himself flat on his face, and lay close. Instantly, without a word being spoken or an order given, another volunteer strode forth from the trenches and replaced the wounded man on the stretcher. The 68th man arose, aud, in spite of the Russian rifles, the threo succeeded in reaching the rear wvithout fmuther damage. Do the records of the war contain a more glant deed than that, or one achieved from humbler or higher niotives'? There was no glory to be won, no promotion to be expected, noteven a name in the Gazcte, much less a K.C.B.-ship or a monument in St. Paurs. I asked my informant what was done for the two men. "Nothing," said he. "Our man was badly 'wounded in returning to join us by a shell; and, althougl I had made up my ntind to give the 68th manl a couple of pounds if I could find him-those were hard and weary da*s, you know-I never had an opportunity of doing so." Life is equally valuable to the peasant as to the peer. Equally strong are tlleir natural affections, their desire to retun, home, to see once more their families and friends, to recount to them their sufferings and escapes, to share with them honours and rewards won at the cost of health and limb. If we compare the case of| these two poor privates of the 68th with that of the two noblemen -who commanded our cavalry on the sad day when our Light Brigade was lost-If we consider that our agricultural and manufacturing population are intelligent and reasoning beings, we shall require no conjuror to tell us wlhy the militaiy service of Englnd is unpopular with her lower classes. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. JACOB OM2IUM.
ILliATLY RENRanT A NUiEB-Iy.-A grave charge was made before the Leeds borough niagLstrates on Monday last against three young mn of respectableappearance and connexions-namely, that about mnidnight of t5unday last they burglaiiously entered aild robbed a nin-. neryia Leeds. The accused wereJohn Jennings, engineer, Renry BaiJey, draughtsinan, and Sanuel IlIen, book-k-eeper. The charge was preferred by " Sister Mary St. Joseph," of the nunnery, Cross-grcen-lane, at the east pait of the pari-h of Ieeds. This institution is described as one used for devotional purposes, and occupied by a small society of Sisters of Mercy. Three of the Sisters, dressed entiuely in black, and having a black veil to shroud their faces, attended the court, accompaniied by three P.oman Catholic priests. The first witness cxauined 'was Â£anni Dfay, *vho said,-I am one of the nuns in the convent in Cross-greenlane, and have been there nearly three years. Ellen Geddes is tho snpenior, and has charge of the establisiunent There are sefen of us, ineltusive of the lady-superior, who reside; in the convent. The convent has a garden attached to it, enclosed by a walL On Saturday night the Sisters went to bed about half-past 10 o'clock, and I was the last downzi stairs. Between 1 and 2 o'clock on Sunday monirig I was awoke by an alarm from the shutters of the horse and by hearing the springing of a watchman's 'rattle. I got lup in consequence, and when I got down stairs I found several of the other sisters there, letting int the police-officers. I heard some men on the premises. After the Sisters went to bed the previous night I went into the library to fetclh a candle, and at thiat tinre the library window was closed. There is a wooden shutter inside, which slides up and down, and that shutter was up when I was last ii the library, aboat half-past 10 o'clock. When I came down stairs after the alann I found the wooden shutter of tSe library window partly open, and the window itself was lifted up and left open as far as the sash would allow. Thero is a passtge leading into tle back-yard, close to the kitchen. A window near the corner of that plassage is also fastened inside by a woodoen shutter with an iron bolt acroesit. - A small roll of ser and calico had been left on the library table; and a small workbox in the bookcase contained some thread, bobbins, and other articles. I have examined the several books and articles now produced, and I know them to be the articles which were previously in the libary. lThe boolc vroduced, Esprlicaion. des Pr-cmni&res V7i;a dce la Religion, is one of our books. The book and other articles referred to were found in the garden of the nunnery, into which they had been thrown or taken out of the nunnery by the defendants and another young man, who was not in custody. Some policemen gave evidence of having seen the tlhree defendants and another young man, about a quarter past 1 o'clock on Sunday morning, near the covenant or ununery, of having seen them get -ver the nunnery wall, and of alarming the sisterhood and apprehending the three defendants. On being asked by the bench what they had to say to the charge, each of the defendants made a statement, the substance of whlich 'was that miade by Jennings, as follows :-"On Saturday night I and my two friends went down to the Queen on the Roundhay-road to 'play at bagatelle, and had something to drink. About lI o'clock at night we left, and I iruist say we were nearly drunk. We thought we would have a lark, and nothing further, ancwe then agreed to go to the nunnery. We got over the wall, and one of niy friends found a window open, and we got in. We commenced kicking uv a row in the place; we did not know what we iwere doing, and threw several things not only about the iplace, but also out of the windowv. We heard an al.ann. and got outt -of the place. WVe mnade little or no effort to get away. We were, howfever, seized and br6ueht up. Th-ure 'was a STourtli person with us, who is not in ciistodyV'1 Each of tho prisoilers eXpressed regret for what rie 1gad dotijc. The judgment of tbe bench wams delivered by -mr. Richardson, -who, after severely censuring the conduct of the llr 1- soners, observing that it approached very nieat to a fMomy, st;ted that the magistrates wished to knOW if they would each consent to pay iif. for the benefit of the Leeds Inrfin ,i ary;if nt te maistateswoud del w the tocase.
