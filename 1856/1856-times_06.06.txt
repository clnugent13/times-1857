T'rn EN-tC3MEF2D ESTATES COSMSSION. 1 he ci)eez) s ontrnal warns the public and the Legislature-both apparently ignorant of the factthat unless something be done in Parliament within thenext few weeks to continue the powers of the Encuumbered Estates Commission those powers will have lapsed, and the inttiatory operations of the most important of the Irish Courts will have been clit abruptly short. This might be a very agreeable oversight and happy consummnation if the ad3nirers i of the old legal tribunals were the only parties con- -rned; but to the public at large the lapse would be regarded in a very diferent light. Meanwhile it should be linownt that the last day for receiving petitions for sale under the existing act will be before the close of the ensuing month of July. rTLE PEACE. The advices from Corlk note a decline of 15s. per cwt. in the price of butter from Friday's to MIonday's rates, and later accounts show a fall of 20s. within three business days. As the necessary consequences of the peace and the favourable turn of the weather, the prices of all kinds of provisions are slowly but steadily coming to their legitimate level. ,FAILMIEES' PROSPECIS. The followiing agricultural repolt for the northwestern counties is condensed from the Derry JTournal, a careful authority upon such matters:- " The extremely dry spring was beginning to cause some Uneasiness at the commencement of May, but early in the nonth we were favoured with a scasonable and plentiful supply of rain, whichhas since continuedvith alternate heat znd. sunshine. The effect, as rsight be expected, has been most feneficial for evey kind of crop, and the season now is all that could be desired, both as regards temperature and the requisite moisture for vigorous growth. Every description of crop is looking well, and fully up to the average degree of forwardnessusual3atthelst of 3une. Wheat of which 'we had reason to speak well throughout the year, continues its firm healthy colour. It is close in plant, and promises carly maturity; but the north-west of Ireland is so liable to an excess of rain in the month of July that it is never Ã¯Â¿Â½afe to predict anything of this crop till after that period. Oats have already recovered from the cold dry weather of April, and are now prorising, and rather early. A large jsuantity of potatoes have been planted, and, as far as we ksnow, the seed has adv-anced well in growth. In this district pota.tces are earlier than they were this tinie last year, but not so favourable as they were at the same period on the two formerseasons. Flax souwn inthe beginnin-of April promises a good yield, but what was sowvn at a lter period, after the rains in May, is not sufficiently advanced for an opinion to be fornsed upon it. The moist weather has greatly beefited the pastures, and land under grass is able to bear as much _tock now aswe ever remember to see it, 3eadow nnd uplndhay both prouise more than an average yield, and, probably oing this favourable change, tihe price of ratt3e has advanced cosiderably during the last month. 3Drv beasts are not less than 25s. a-head dearerthan they: w ere on the 1st of Ma,.

THE OXFORD COJMMEMOfORAToNV. T:. ftollowing further particulars of the cer^mony of pro Ecr.ting the Honorary Doctors of Law Nill be interesting to arry-df our readers -The Pegent of Baden and Prince WiRlEai Frederick ef Prussia, being made Doctors hy diploma, accompanielthe Chancellor of tke Uuiversity on his erance into the Sheldonisn Theatre with his Royal Highness Prince Albert, and took their seats at once in the sem icircle on the left of the Chancellor, his Royal Highne_ss being seated on his riglht rhand. The 1:onorary Doctors meanwhile remaiaed in the Divinity School, while the Chancellor proposed their Graces to the house-or, in o'her v,words. asked the cansent -f the Convocation to each degree. The placcts hav-ig been recorded, tle bedels left the rheatre, and shoztLly%reappeered, ushering in a most brihiant cs-rtige, which mnade iRs way -with diffliculty through the dense croNwd in the erca to the foot of the -steps Reading up to the Eemicircle of -the Doctors. The Ambassador of tha Sultan was the leading perscnage, followed by the Prussian Inister and 'he Marquis of -Aber,corn. After him came the Earl of Clarendon and the other candidates, in '-te usua' order of -precedence. As soon as the procession reached the Steps of the -semicircle, the '-Regius -Professor of Civil Law presented the Ambassador to the Chancellor, and introdnoed him in a short Latin spmech as *the first Christien subject of the Porte who has ever represented the pe-son of the Sultan as his Ambassador, end congratulated the University on the occasion of his visit being -at so auspicious a moment, whe- the Sultan hadigranted equal laLws a:d full ci-il rights to his Christi-an subjects. The nzme of 'the Earl of Clarendon, which followed the announceasent of the Prussian 'Uinister and the Harquis of Abercorn, was welcomsi with loud plaudits, more -especially -when the Professor alluded to h-s great ancestor (whose character as a historian was the subject of the Stanhope prize), and whose name ':is Lordship had preferred to retain rather than accept a higher title from his Soereign in reward for hiis distinguished services. Lord E;lgin's successful adminis-tration of Canada was next referred to in connexion with the promotion cf its foreign trade by treaties of commerce -nd the develor.ment of its inteaal rwesources by great lineof railway and other public works. T-he nanie of Sir Edmnld Lyons was received with great applause. The Professor alluded to the enemy having sunk their ships rather than -isk their destruc-on by encountering the allied fleet. The hombardment of Sweaborg was coulpled with the name of Sir Richard Dundas, while the capture of Bomarrund and the overthrow of Sebastopol were oited in illustration of the engineering skill of Sir Harry Joues. Dr. Sandwith's endurance and his hunanity to friend anad foe alike, during the terrible siege of Kars were the next subject of eulogy, and a tribute of respect was paid to General 2-fonravieff for his treatment of tne Briti:h prisoners. Dr. Barth's intrepidity in exploring the course of the river Benin, the western branch of the Xiger, was the last subject of commendation, and his constancy was highly praised in resisting for seven months the threats of the King of Timbuctoo, and his endeavours to compel him by the fear of instant death to renounce the Christian faith. The names of the other distingmushed candlidateswlhosegood deeds were also recited-Lord Ashburton's, in reference to his exertions in promoting the education of the poor, Sir Henry Holland's, in regard to his vritings on medical science and psychology-were all most favourably received, and the presence of the Chancellor of the University gave more than usual interest to the cere3nony of admission, which followed immediately after the presentation of each Honorary Doctor.
UXIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE. OXFORD, JUNE 5. Oin Monday last Mr. Samuel lMl'Caul, of St. John's College, vas elected to the open Hebrew Scholarship on the Pusey and Ellerton foundation. This distinction has been o'otuned for three successive years by late pupils of Merch.ant Taylors' School-in 18.54 by r. Alexander Israel 'Caul; in 1855, by MIr. W. Wynne Willson. In a Convocation held this day, at S o'clock, the degree of D.D. was taken by Jasper Hume Nicolls, M.A., late Mlichell Fellow of Queen's College, and now Principal of Bisho;'s College, Lenoxville, Canada, under the statute (Tit. Lr, sect. v, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6) allowing persons in ecclusiastical or civil employment in the coTonies to take degrees without appearin in person. ^Sever.aother degrees were conferred, but, the Registrar having gone to town with the address to the Queen irnlediately after the Convocation, particulars cannot be given until to-mOTrow.

,SOCZETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VICE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Siz,-I am requested by the committee to solicit the favour of your insertion of the subjoined extract from the minutes of a meeting of the committee held this day. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, H. PRICHARD, Secrefary. 57, Lincolnfs-imn-lields, June 5. "Resolved, that the coammittee take the earliest opportunity of statmng that, in the matters brought under the consi. de-rtion of the Court of Queen's Bench on the 2nd inst, .1r. Prichard, their secretary, acted in his ministerial character only, and in accordance with his instructions, of which the committee deem it right to take upon themselves the entire responsibility; while, at the same time, they desire to bow with the utmost respect to the opinion of the Court as to the exercise, from a mistaken lenity, of a dis. cretion whicli they find not to have been vested in them.'
ZTHE Lo0qs OFP MEIJ KAQg AbWAkA We have been requested to publish the followint extract from a letter by Lord Alfred :Paget, describing the loss of his yacht, and the narrow escape from drowning of his Lordship and her crew .- "Last night, a little before midnight, I was on my passage from Colchester to the Isle of Wight, and was running before a light air-the wind easterly-going about three to four miles an hour. The night was beautifully clear and bright starlight. When off the South Foreland, aboat four miles from the lighthouse, as I was coming up the! companion-ladder, I heard the men on deck shouting to ai steamboat to "stop her !" I was on deck in an instant, and saw a steamer making straight for us at full speed. In about a couple of miinutes she struck us in the starboard bow, causing the yacht to reel almost under water .and propelling us forward some distance, as, strange to say, her paddles were not stopped even when she struck us. " The shock was terrific, and when the steamer did stop and get clear it became evident that the yacht was fast sinking bythe head. One of my men jumped on board the steamer, and entreated the captain to stay by our sinking vessel and send a boat to save us. His request was, after some hesitation, complied with; but in the meantime we bad managed to launch our longboat, and had just time to get into her when the yacht went down with all her sails set. Neither I nor any of the crew had time to save an article of any kind. I requested the officer in charge of the steamer's gig to take us on board and tow us to the land, but this he refused to do, saying he had despatches on board; so we had a long and hard pull against the tide, running outvery strong, and at last succeeded, thank God, in getting into Dover harbour. " Had any look-out been kept on board the steamer, on so lovely and cahn a night a vessel might easily have been seen two miles off, especially one with new sails; but I am sorry to say that in too many instances these vessels, going at the rate of 12 or 14 knots an hour, altogether neglect that precaution, and many a poor fisherman is run down bythem and never heard of more. " The Alma was nearly 70 tons, and was only completed atthe end of last year. We put our helm to port, as the law requires, but, having little more than steerage way, we could do nothing to save her." The vessel which caused this accident a..ppears to have been the Belgian mail steam-packet Diamond.
HER MfAfESTYS THEATRE. T'h ballet, already strong, gains a valuable reinforcement froma the engagementof Mademoiselle Marie Taglioni. Few of the habitues wil aave forgotten the promising dannscre , some years baek, took her place among the Holer "stars" of tbe profession, and 'created surprise by 'the boldness if her achievements, while she ased by the extroeme puerility of Iher countenance, The offect was that of a precocious child in her early teens, snato-inr at honours which might excnte the ambition sf a veteran of 20. This youthful Tfaglioni now conies back to us-an aspirant no longer, bat a da)sscese on a grand scale, looking not a little staid, in spite of the goo. humour of her -expession, and much resembling herworli-renowned aunt. Bfhepas (ledeuex whichsheexecutes with Si. Charles (another return of value belongs to the highest-school of the art, and the young lady disting,uishes herself as much by the breadth of her movements as by the graee -and facility with which she goes through tLem. NVhsther she is endowed with dramatic power is yet to be leant', but that she is -a consummate mistress of dancing the-e is no doubt. tele pennanenco of Mademoiselle Piccelomini's success is ini tself so remarkable tlhat it is worth recording as * per-' ateually fresh fact. Here is a young vecalist, who comes out in au opera that everybody declares to he musically worth-: 15ss, and the libretto of which is simply abominable, and: -yet crowds flock to wit ness her perforca-nce, and testifl such delight that there seeoas scarcely ary need for her appearance in' anew part. There are the same persons who have looked at her from the night of her debut watching with anxiety the progress of the dying scene, feeling sympathetially uncomfortable wen she gives signs of her assumed pulmonary complaint, glowing with rapture when, in the dluet wiath Aifredo, (the prettiest sore L71in the opera), she alternates such intense passion with such gentle sorrow, and th.undering forth long repressed acciamations when the moment of death has at last arived. There are artists who gain the admiring ufes of the public without readhingts heart; thsre are others who awaken a sort of persona affection. ademoiselle Piccolomini has proved herself to be one of the latter class, and so completely has she got the mind of her admirers into her own power, mad so absorbed are they by the mimic scene before them, that some of them see-m to fany that she really dies every rniglrt on purpose to be revived by their plaudits.
ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA. The first performance of fDenizetti's Favorier toat place last night before a brilliant audience, among whom were 11er Majesty, Prince Albert, and their Royal guests. The cast of the opena was rery nearly the same as last year, the principal characters-Leonora, Ferdinardo, and Alfonso-being sustained by Grisi, Mario, and Graziani. The 7dalle--which, to use cemmon parlance, " gives a lif-' to the early acts of La Fam'rita, in themselves essentiallv dull-was greatly strengthened in attraction by the ay d of Madame Cerito, whose execution of a Spanish dance was as exquisitely graceful as it was animated. But, although Signor Graziani sang the well known romance of the King-" A tanto Amior"-with genuine feeling, and Grisi gave wonderful life and spirit to that burst of sentiment (so tamely expressed in the music)-" O mio Ferdinando;"andeven-withMario'sportrayalof manly independenoe and disdain, when the outraged Ferdinando casts his Sovereign's orders at the Royal feet, and breaks the sword that had done loyal service-in spite of all this, the fourth act lest night was, as it has always been, and ever must be, the only really -and intenselyinteresting feature of the opera. Here, while the magnificently painted cloister scene by Ir. Grie-ve was missed, as much was done by Mr. Bevenvey as the constrained limits of the Lyceum Theatre would allow, and a taUbean was presented, unlike its predecessor at the larger theatre, yet still beautiful and apropriate. About the singing and acting of Grii and .ar_o in the last act of the Favorite it would be difficult to say anything that has not been said already. Nevertheless, the impression derived is always fresh and delighitful, since what is genial and true can never tire; and we believe that the lyric stage has not presented for many years anything more admirably truthful, natural, and picturesque than the performance of the two great artists in this particular scene. With what deep passion Grisi paints the remorse and despair of the unhappy Leonora, and with what romance the characterf of tlse deceived and generously forgiving Ferdinando is invested by Mario are notorious.' Never were the varied emotions so tenderly and melodiously embodied-in music bv which Donizetti would have redeemed a far weaker opena than La Ferorita threatens to be at the outset-delneated with more earnestness and felicity than last night. The plaintive air, "Angiol d'amore "-in which Ferdinando laments the lost ideal of his early love-sung by Mario -with profound and genuine sentiment, was unanimously encored, The final scene was as touchingas ever. Leonora's recognition of heroffended lover, her anguisli, and her death, were, in the hands of Grisi, exhibitions of feeling and consnmnate art that could not fail to delight all who are capable of being impressed with what is at once -'reat and effortless. The conCluding duet, " Vien, tutto obbYio per te"-where Ferdinando is moved to compassion and oblivion of the past by Leonora's bitter repentance-was, as usual, a fine burst of passion, and the curtain slowlv fell to the solemn admonition of the monks, iipon a performance that could hardly have failed to satisfy the most exacetng audience. It should be mentioned that the part of Baldassare was very well played by M. Zelger, who during the absence of Lablache, and in the anticipation of Herr Forrnes, seems to have all the "heavy" business on his hands.
ADE,LPHI THEATBE. Those younger playgoers wIho have not a clear notion what sort of a thing an old English nielodrasna used to be should not miss the opportunity of seeing the Flying Dutchmian, whieh has been revived at the Adelphi, and which nearly 30 years ago was one of the most popular w-orks of its class. They will find in it a strange lack of compactness and of clearly defined purpose, but at the same time they WiM recognize a great mastery over the expedients for producing visible effects, and respect this talent the more -when tlleyreflectthat it vas entirelyofnative growth. Mr. Fitzball, in the days of his glory, never dreamed of casting glances across thc Channel; he went on constructing his works, such as they 'were, from his own resources, and though his dialogue will never probably be cited as a clas-ical spacimen of dramatic vriting, he displayed a fertility of invenition in which he has rarely been surpassed. The piece has been put on the stage with as much care as if it were a novelty, and nearly the whole strength of the company is employed on the representation. Vanderdecken, one of the famous parts of Mr. T. P. Cooke, when he had not so completely devoted himself to the nautical line as to abandon the goblins and demons with whom he was associated in the early part of his career-Vanderdecken, we say, gains a new aspect from the circumstance that he is sustained by Madame Celeste, who makes of him a most ideal ghost. The places that were once occupied by Messrs. Wrench, Terry, and John Reeve, are now filied by Messrs. Webster, Selby, and Wright, and Rodwell's very pretty music is sung with good effect by Misses Mary Keeley and Kiate Kelly. As for the phantom-shlip, vwith its phantasmagoric ghostliness, it is m far finer condition than hi the ola times, and the tossing sea is of a quality to satisfy the most severe judge of undulating carpets.
'xIL A35EIcAE N.LAits.-SOuTHAanoy, June 5. -The United States mail steamer Arago, Captain Lines, sailed yesterday (Wednesdav) from Havre and Southamp. ton, with the French and nglish mails, 173 passengers, and about 350 tons of cargo. Air. Fillmore, ex-President of the United States, crossed from Havre to Southampton by this steamer, and proceeded to London this morning. The .Arago takes despatches from Mr. Dallas, the American Minister in London, to the United States Government. The French steamer Alma, belonging to the Franco-Ame rican Company, is hourly expected at this port from Havre, to undergo some slight repairs. The AlIma started from Havre for New York on Tuesday, but, owing to a dis. arrangement of her screw-propeller, was compelled to put back. About 40 of her passengers proceeded on their voyage in the mail-steamer Arago. Messrs. Croskey and Co., the agents at this port for the Alma, have made every arrangement so as to insure her speedy departure for New YerkJ after the needful repairs have been effected.
AIEETIYG QOF THE CRABWPY CHILDR.FN. The anniversary gathering of the charity children from the various free schools of the metropolis (56 in number) took place yesterday in the nave of St. Paurs Cathedral, and attracted, as usual, many-thousands of persons. The nature of this ceremony and its characteristic features have been so frequently described that they must be familiar to ourreaders. Such a spectacle as that presented by the children, however, the oftener seen the more firmly is it impressed upon the mind. The coup d'til, from whatever part of the cathedral it may be -witnessed, is equally magniflicent and astonishing. Nor is the spectacle offered by the congregation less imposing-something like 15,000 people being so closely packed together, that the whole mass appears to be animated as with a single impulse -to ebb and flow, as it were, like the tide of some mighty ocean. It muay safely be asserted that nowhere else can such a view of concentrated life be presented, nor so vast a crowd assembled, for purposes so simple and devoid of artificial excitement. Every one comes to see the children; and that alone is wvorth a day's journey. And under vwha' more edifying circumstances could these interesting objects of a great city's foresight and benevolence be regarded ? There was no change whatever in the musical selection -which has for many years accompanied the full cathedral service. What the children did was, of course. more interesting than anything else. Once again we have to record how capitally the " Gloria Patri" was pronounced by the multitude of young and fresh voices, in response to the reading psalms, as chanted by the members of the choirs; and once again to state how much better and more steadily the 100th Psalm-" AUl people that on earth do dwell"was sung than the others, although (to the credit of Mr. Bates-who has not only the task of beating time from his lofty rostrum at the anniversaries, but of preparing the children for the event) a real improvement was observed in the 113th-" Ye saints and servants of the Lord"v'hich preceded, and the 104th-" My soul praise the Lord"-which followed, the sermon. There is, nevertheless, in the first of these three psahns a certain frankness of melody, a marked and easily intelligiblo rhythm, which eminently suits it for an occasion like the present, and for the simultaneous utterance of a multitude of voices. If it be really true, as some good authorities insist, that the tune of the " old hundredth" was composed in the first half of the 16th century, by Claude Goudimel, then to a Frenchmam must accrue the honour of having invented the best and moAt Englishe psalm-tune in existence. it is sztange enough, however, that in France the air should be utterly unknown -or, at least, unremembered. The melody to which the 113th Psalm is sung does not date so far back as the other by upwards of two centuries; while that of the 104th (attributed to Dr. Croft), was composed in 1702. IE both these a certn want of freedom and simplicity is observable ; and .t is wonderftul how the children can manage to execute them so well. Against t'-e preecs and responses of Tallis we have nothing to say; -but we cannot bcEleve otherwise than that every mtusically-educated ear would be glad to recognize something less vulgar and commonplace than the rn-out " Jones in I)," to which the " Venite" is eternally chanted. The strength of the unit-nd choirs was put to the ordinary tests. For "To Deum' and "Jubilate," we had the seemingly imperisbable (and terribly hackneyed) " Boyce in -as though it was impossible for any living musicisn to compose, or icr the practised members of our best choirs to perform, anything moreelevated in style or less absolutely stale in expression. Every one acquainted with musical matters is aware that Mr. Goss, the present organist of St. Pauls-under whose able and careful superintendence the whole of the arrangements at these anniversaries are conducted-is himself a composer of merit. Formerly it was one of the dutiese-f an organist to write mnusic for his choir. Why not now? Mr. Attwood-Mr. Goss's predecessor-produced a gat many anthems, &-c., and M. Goss is quite able to emulate Mr. Attwood. The idea of attempting anything new' with the children is, we fear, altogetherihopeless ; bat surely the combined choirs are equalto the labour of learning a fresh anthem or two, if only to allow Dr. Boyce and his brethren that repose of which tLey (and the public) have so long stood in need. The anthem of Handel, " iadok the Priest" {oomposed for the coronation of George 1L), and the " HaUelujah" chorus, from the Mressiah, iF would be difficult to replace, although itmust be owned the former is nowadays absurdly inapproprinato. Whri-.-cr objcctions, however, might be entertained would be wa^ved by reasonable persons on behalf of t he children, wvhose unison entries on bhe words " God save the King," " Long live the King," " May the Kin- live for ever," have a really sutblime effect. The "' Hallelu-jh," which ought to be more imposing, is much less so bhen the other-ip consequence of the slow time at which it is taken to accommodate the children. There are parts, nevertheless, even in this which are very fine and im- se. On the whoir, we must congratulate itr. Goss and his taleated associate, Mr. George Cooper (sub-organist), on the riusical part of the ceremony yesterday, whiclh, if it offered no novelty, at least suggestedimprovementsinthe,generalexecution. Theeowereonly two trumpets (instead of fGur) to strengthen and assist the organ, but it was remiarled that the perfornmers (Messrs. Macfarlane and Ward) played so well and with such emphasis that the deficiency oounted ahnost for nothing. Mr. G. Rodwell wes at the drcrms. The lessons (Job iv., and Mark vi.) were read by the Rev. W. F. Hall, rector of Tottenham, and the prayers intoned by the Rev. W. C. F. Webber, both minor canons. Thes ermon was preachedi by the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop o lincoln, who selected for his text the 4th chapter of Deuteronomy, verse 2,-" Ye shall not add to the words that I command you, neither sh211 ye dininish therefrom." We have more than once suggested that the sermon should be printed and distributed before, instead of after the ceremony, otherwise it may just as well not be delivered at all, since it is impossible, except for those lucky enough to be in the vicinity of the pulpit, to hear a single word of it. The aiml of the discourse-which is naturally to impress the congregation with a due sense of the important object for which the free schools are assembled, and to solicit the charitable support of the public-is therefore communicated to so very few that it has little chance of winning countenance through the direct influence of the preacher. Whereas. if the words had been perused in advance, the end would be answered in a far more satisfactory manner. Last year it v as feared that these anniversary meetings would cease, and the Society of Patrons be dissolved. Happily no such disgrace to this metropolis is likely to enrue. A consideraole sum in excess of what was collected at the doors in 1355 was obtained yesterday; and thiswith the aid of certain economies, useless to specify-may enable the directors to make a more creditable " show" than they have done for some time. We are inclined to believe that the main purport of the annual gatherings is not generally knowln, or the public would contribute more generously (less meanly would be more appropriate) after the enjoyment of so unparalleled a ceremony. Whatever, thien, remains, when the expenses (which are necessarily heavy) are disbursed is divided among the needier of the free schools, on application being made to the society of patrons. Such schools as those of Bethnal-green, Bermondsey, Whitechapel, &c.-which are poorly endowed-might receive timely and substantial benefit from the meetings, if tho public at large would come forward with a little more liberality. But if, from nearly 15,000 persons, only a few hundred pounds can be obtained, the amount is barely sufficient to cover the outlay attendant on the preparations. It would indeed be humiliating if in a city so wealthy and populous as this such a celebration as the annual assembly of the charity schools should be allowed to die for lack of encouragement. Among the congregation yesterday was observed the Lord Mayor of London-a fact to whieh, for reasons superfluous to explain, more than ordinary consequence was attached. We must not conclude withsout recording our sense of the politeness anld attention extended to the representatives of the press, more especiaUy by Mr. Frederic Fuller, one of the most zealous and indefatigable members on the committee of the Society of Patrons.
CRYSTAL PALACE CONCERTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-AIlow me, in reply to your correspondent, "A Lover of Justice," to state that he is entirely mistaken in supposing that the directors of the Crystal Palace Company have ever promised or pledged themselves, either directly or indirectly, to reserve the concerts to the holders of season tickets only. Their intention was, and is, not to admit a greater number of persons than could be conveniently accommodated so as to hear the music; and if such a number of two guinea tickets had been sold as to occupy the whole space none but the holders of such tickets would have been admitted. The experience of the first two concerts, when season ticket holders only were admitted, provedithat available space still remained, and even at the third concert, when persons paying 7s. 6d. were admitted, there were still some seats unoccupied. It mnst also be borne in mind that season ticket-holders are in fact admitted to the concerts at the rate of Is. 9d. eaeh; and, therefo),e, the charge of 7s. 6d. to the public seems a more than sufficient protection to their rights. With regard to the reserved seats, their adoption was forced on the direction by the demand of the public for such accommnodation. No one is obliged to take them; according to your ctrrespondent's own showing they are not in the best places; the galeries which contain them were Put up ifter the mass of the season tickets had been sold ; and, therefore, no one is injured by their appropriation; but the convenionce they afford to the public is so much appreciated that they are all engaged before each concert, and there is no doubt that oven twice the number of them would be willingly paid for by the public if they could be provided. I-lam, Sir, your obedient servant. JAS. FERGUSSON. LTrystal Falace, June .5.

OLD TRgES IfV THE PARKS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Snr,-Will you allowv me to make a suggestion in your valuable journal of a method by which the old trees in the parks may be preserved for almost any number of years ? In Hyde Park, near the boat-house, there are several old elm trees, which are nearly hollow, and are the receptacles of all manner of filth. If these trees were built up inside vith bricks and mortar, and all the snsaller crevices filled in the same manner, the trees woulld stand for another 50 years, and be no longer nuisances to the neighbourhood. But, besides saving old trees from falling, this mode of filling Up holes in hcalthy trees will be found luost valuable, and save them fromn rotting. It will be foiuid on examination that where the largo limbs branch off from the main trunk there is a flat place, on which the water lies, and eventually forms a hole, which in time rots the centre of the tree. If these holes are carefully filled, and all other holes madeby rotten branches, &c., the tree will last a great time. I remain, Sir, your very obedient servant. H.

The Earl of HARDWICKE asked for information froni the Government on a subject of the greatest importance. Through the medium of a newspaper which was supposed to enjoy the confidence of the Government they had heard that Her Majesty's Minister at Washington had been summarily dismissed. Under thcse circumstances, perhaps, Her Majesty's Government would not feel surprised at his making the inquiry whether or no that report was an accurate one? Earl GRA-NVILLE.-I have not seen any such statement as that to which the noble earl has alluded, and I can only say that I am not aware that any official information to that effect has reached Her Majesty's Government. LIMTED LIABILITY. Lord OVERSTONE presented petitions from various places in SouthLancashire against the LimitedLiability Bill, as being a measure which would lead to excessive speculation, and wvhich would damage the commercial character of the country, and which contained no provision against reckless trading on the part of the managers of companies which might be formed under the act. After a few words from Lord DElRIU in eulogy of the measure the subject dropped. The Hay and Straw Trade Bill was read a second time. APPELLATE JURISDICTIOIT (HOUSE OF LORDS) BILI. On bringing up the report of amendments on this bill, The Earl of 3INTO, who took exception to certain portions of the Gth clause on the ground that they vere calculated to linmit unduly the prerogative of the Crown, moved a Iseries of verbal amendments vith the view of obviating his objections. The precise fonn of the amendments was as follows :-in line tvwo, after the words " shal hereafter," to insert " under the authority of this act ;" in line 26, after the words "life only," to insert "under this act ;" in line 28, after the -words "for life only," to insert "created under the authority of this act ;" and to add the following ne M proviso :-" Provided always that nothing herein contained shall be constraed as restricting or otherwise affecting the exercise of the Royal prerogative, such as it existed prior to the passing of this Earl GRANVILLE did not believe that the Rouse of Lords had a right by itself, or by any mere resolution of itsown, to decide the question of prerogative. Nlevertheless% practically the House did decide it, because, if their lordshins resolved not to admit a life peer, a life peer could not be forced upon the House. Such being the anomalous state of affairs, it appeared to him that the best thing to be done was for the three powers of the realm to come to a unanimous decision as to what the practice should beforthe future. It could not be denied thab the Crown had abandoned a porton of its prerogative in consenting to the introduction of the present bill. At the same time the House had made a great concession, after declaiing that life peerages were unconstitutional in admitting that a limited number should sit in that house. Such a mutual arrangement having been arrived at it would be undesirable to disturb it. Lord UCAIIBELL expressed his satisfaction at what had just fallen from the President of the Council, and observed that it was no more than he had expected from the high and henourable character of the noble earl. The Earl of WVICKLOW said, that there wero many things which astonished him with regard to this bilL He had hea-rd, for example, that a compromise had been entered into in reard to it; but by whom, he asked, had that compromise been made? for certainly that House had never entered into any compromise. (Hear.) The effect of the bill wotuldbe to cutdownand impair theprerogative of the Crown. The noble marquis, who was not now present (the .Marquis of Lanedewne, 'ad stated on aprevious evemng that no consideration should induce himn to support this bill if in any manner it infiinged the prerogative of the Crown. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack had stated upon the same occaon that it would in no way affect the prerogatire; but now they were told by the nobl ecarl the-President of the Council that it was intended to limit the prerogative of the Crown. It appeared, therefore, thattheywere now about to pass a bill which, though intended, no doubt, for a good and impartant purpose, contained provisions of great stringency, as to the effect of which different members of the Government held views utterly at variance with one another. He reminded their lordships that theywere about to launch this bill on the stormy sea of the HEouse of Commons; and it behoved them thoroughly to understand its nature andpurgort before sending it down to that House. He trusted that tne noble earl would persevere in the amendments 'whch ho had proposed. The IORD CHANCELLOR wsished to explain that what he had said thc other night was that, if there was no prerogative of the Crown in this matter, as soeie asserted, then the Prerogative could not be affec'ed by the present bilL He certainly thought it was onlyfair dealing to pass this bill as it now stood. (Hear.) Lord DEN1A_NT objected to the bill, and was understood to ve notice that on the third reading he should move that it bead a third time that day six months. The amendment -was -withdrawn and the report was received. The Reformatory Schools (Scotland) Bill, andthe .ational allery Bill were read a third time and passed. 140N-.CO.SECRATION IOF BURIAIGROUNDS. The Earl of SIIAFTESBIRY presented a petition fiom the mayor and inhabitants of Blandford, complaining of the non-consecration of a new burialground by the diocesan in that town. The present case, he observed, might not in itself bo one of great importance, but it became a? matter of serious consideration when they bore in mind that there were many more cemeteries vhich had been erected in the same circumstances and under the authority of the same act with that of Blandford, and it was therefore necessary some decision should be come to in order to avoid a great deal of inconvenience and public scandal. Their lordships wiould recollect that some years ago, m conseqiience of great apprehensions which existed on the subject of intramural interments, an act was p2ssed with the view of providing a remedy for the evils that prevailed. By that act power was given to the Govermuent to close, by an order in Council, existing burying grounds, and the persons who had the charge of those burying grounds were required to construct other graveyards and build chapels within which might be celebrated the burial service according to the rites of the church of England, provision having also been made for the service being conducted according to the viewvs of the Nonconformists. The petitioners now before their lordships stated that they had complied with aU the requirements of the act-that they had formed a graveyard and constructed a chapel fortho purpose of havingperformed in ittheburial service according to the rites of the church of England, the old g,raveyard of the parish having been closed by an order in Council. They complained, hovever, that the diocesan refused to consecrate the new ground because a communion table had not been set up in the chapel for the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Now, their lordships would observe that these country chapels were entirely the creatures of the act to which he had referred, having had no existence before, and vere scarcely Inown to the civil or ecclesiastical law of the land; and it appeared to him that the refusal of the bishop to consecrate in this case arose from a complete misapprehension of the law. In the first place, it would be found, on reference to the rubric, that there was no necessity for a chapel at all for the performance of the burial service. These chapels had been constructed for purposes of deceney and convenience and to afford shelter dunng inclement weather. By the 16th and 17th sections of the act it was provided- --., snaii De lawful for any burial board to build on any land to be purchased orappropriated foraburialground, under this act, and according to a plan to be approved of by the bishop of thc diocess a chapel for the performance ofthe burial service according to the rites of the United Church of England and Ireland; and such burialground may be consecrated by the bishop of the diocess, wlen the same shall appear to him to be in a fit andc roper condition for the purpose of interment according to the rites of the united The act was precise in limiting the purpose of the chapel to The performance of the burial service according to the rites of tieunitedchurch of England and Ireland, and it provided that the ground might be consecrated by the bishop when such should appear to him to be in a fit condition for the purpose of interment with such rites. It said nothino about consecrating the chapel, but only the burying ground, when approved by the bishop. Now, to show the intention of the Legislature, and that this was no haphazard arrangemnent, but designed to exclude these chapels from consecration, he would shortly state the history of the act. In IS50 he was a memberof theBoardof Health, which presented a very long report, recommending the construction of cemeteries, aud the erection of chapelsinthese cemeteries for the performance of the funeral-service. The board, however, made one recommnendation which theLegislature did not approve. They said,- " We recommend that in every cemetery there be a part consecrated, . . . and that in the consecrated part there be erected a church adapted to -the purpose, and fitted also for full service according to the doctrine and discipline of the church of England." The intention of the board was that in each of the new cemeteries a chapel should be erected in which the full and complete service of thq church of England, includin- the administration of the sacranients, could be performed. 0The Government of the day adopted the recommendation of the board on that subject, and the 5th clause of the bill which was proposed provided:-w " Jt shall be lawful for the said board to build in every -6E - -vuuvauWvLy a new one, ana wwnen iie was plced over his diocess he had some difficulty in determining how to deal with them. Lord Coke laid it down distinctly that the law took no cognizance of any church or chapel until it had been consecrated, Theedificesinwhichthe burial service of the churchwere performed were therefore not mere shelters from the blast, bat places which revuired. consecration. A difficulty, however, arose as to how they wero to be consecrated, there being no form prescribed for the purpose, and the act of Parliament restricting the use of the chapels to the performance of the burial service alone. Still, in coming to a decision on the matter, he 1was not left -wholly witlout precedent. He had for his guide the practice of his venerated predecessor, who was in the habit of including the celebration of the Holy Communion in the form of consecration -which he adopted. The form drawn up in 1712, to 'which the noble earl had alluded, also comprised the Holy Communion; and that eminent man, Bishop Andrewrez, invariably treated that rite as an essential part of the cerenicial of consecration. MIoreover, according to the canon lnw, it was a grave question whether the solemnization of the Lord's Supper was not of the substance of the act of consecration. In the first place, then, he held that these chapels ought to be consecrated, and next, that in their consecration tbe Holy Communion should be celebrated. -In the exercise of the discretion reposed in him as bishop, he had xcade this principle the rule in his diocess. That being so, it was obvious that a communion table was indismensable forthese buildings. He had had 12 other cases like the present to deal with, in none of which had the slightest ankindly or jarring feehng been excited between him and the burial boards; and he might therefore appeal to their lordships whether he was a likely person to di:spoe of matters of this kind in an overhearing or dictatorial spirit. (Hear.) A communication having been made to his secretary last year, to the effect that the plans of the BlauYdord burial board were prepared, he immediately ren3ied. that there ought to be a table in the chapel to enable the rite of consecrationtoDbedulyv,erformed. T- , ansr,. my Lu :sereLary or sne onrIal board was that there wcTud be no difficulty in meeting the wishes of the bishop. Subsequently, however, his secretaryreceived from tbe board the copy of a resolution which it had agreed to. The petitioners had complained of his conduct towards them, yet their own resolution was hardly so courteous, or, he mighbsay, so dutiful towards their bishop as it ought to have been. They remonstrated with him for imposing heavy additional expenses on the ratepayers by his plan, esoeciallv as the chapel was iatended for such limited uses, and not for Divine service generally. This was the -way in which his simple requisition for the means of dulyperfornifig the act of consecration according to the dictates of his judgmentan& conscience as a bishop of the church -was met by the burial board. On the 17th of September he rece6ved a- letter from a noble lord (Lord Poitman), accusing him of creating disturbance where there had always been harmony, and of pursuing a course calculated to increase the -rowing tendency to disparage episcopal consecration. I:e letter also pointed out that a persistence in his plan mightinterfere with the noble lord's rights as patron of a neighbouring living, and it concluded by entreating him to reconsider his proposal. The right rev. prelate then read extracts from the correspondence between himself and the noble lord in question. In his replies the right rev. prelate defended the view he took of the nature of consecration; maintained that his recommendation to theburial board in regard to the fitting of the chapel was rcoderate .,, vUuni-U;v promisea zo seeic aanvce on certain of the points raised bg the noble lord ; nnd expressed a hope that the noble lord would, on a fuller consideration of the case, be induaced to placo his powerful local influence on the side of episcopal authority. Thc noble lord's own legal advisers had assured him that, inpssnuch as the sentence of consecration contemplated that the chapel should be limited to burial service they were satisfied that the precise formn of the 'consecration could not give to the ceremony a more etended application. This being the case, he had opethate then terminate, and that the whole matter in disputewold be amicably arranged. This expectation was unfcrtunatel falsified by the event. A meeting at which the nobe lord (LordPortman) deliveredaveryirittingspeech, washeld at Blandford, anid resulted in a resolution that areduestahould again be made tohim(theBishopof Salisbury)to consecrate the ground in another form than that whcich le bel in hisconscience to be the rightone, andwithoutthe celebration ot HolyConimunion. To that application he could not assent, and hIs reasons for dechning to do so he explained most fully in a letter which he addressed to the secretary of the Bradford Bmial Board. [The right rev. prelate read the comnmanication in question.] That letter was written in the month of February, and shortly after ';5 receipt another proposal was made to ini to 'the effect that, cutting off the large portion of the ground in which the building stood, he should consecrate the remainder. To that request also he was unable to accede, because the parish church was so far from the cemetery that it would be^mpossible to perform that portion of the burial service wl4ch was required to be performed in a church or chapel and considerable dissatisfaction would not fail tn oy te reelngsuat the tuneral ceremony had been celI brat2d in an incomnplete and defective manner. This unfortunate controversy had caused him deep pain, but he had been influenced throughout by the purest motivs, and had acted from first to last under the conscientious conviction, which he still retained, that chapels, even though they should be strictly limited to the uases and -iurposes of the burial service, ought to be consecrated, and that the proper method of consecrating them was by administering the roly Comnmunioll Within their wls. This conviction furnisbhe the imia motive.of Iir conduct, but he frankly owned that there was anotherr con sideration whicli though not a matter of principle, bad ad some influene in formiog his judgment on this subject. All churohmen, having sMelred. agreat loss by thes -aration of their schurch yards frton their paripeh churche were naturally desirous that, in committing the bodies of their friends to the earth, the ceremony should be surrunded &s 3nuchaspossiblebythecirumsto~ ordinanilycbatucteristio of the burial service prescribed by their reliwon q te h ), -A that the sacred edifice in which such servdc,6 was perfosm eA sholdnotlok lkea metng-oue,but ratlher rieznhlU a such burial ground a chapel for the perfonnance of tervices according to therites of the uited church of England and Ireland." f:nldan The House of Commons took great offence at that proposi-' tion, and some hon. gentlemen declared that it conte=nulated& a system of church extension under the pretence of cairYing out the views of the board. The bill was comnittedpro frrnzeZ, to receive amendments, and the folloving clause was introduced:- " It shall be lawful to build in every such burial ground a suitable chapel for the performance of burial service according to the rites of the church of England anld Ireland." Ineir lorascops Would observe that, althounh provision was made for the erection of chapels, not a word was said about their consecration; and he thought, therefore, it wa :vidently the intention of the Legisature that these chapels ohould be used simpl.y and solely lor the performance of tho burial service, and that thev shlould not receive conscrzation which would fitlthem for the performance of all the ritee nd ordinances of the establshed church. If the cemetery chapels were consecrated according to the existing forms of consecration, the provisions of the statute would bedirect1rviolated, because by the terms of the statute those chapt s were excluded from consecration, which ceremony was Jo_ apply sinply to the burial grounds. He thought it wsperfeatly clear from the consecration service now used, that that service was only intended for buildings in which the full services of the church of England were to be performed. in 1712 a form of consecration was dravn up by the -Upper House of Convocation; it was sent down to the Lower - Ionse, and, although it never received the Royal assent, it was, according to Buwns' Ecc?esiasticaZ Lazv, the form in general use. That form, however, provided for the dministration of the Communion, and it was evidently intended to be used only for the consecration of churches or charels in which the full services of the church of England weie to be performed. In 1712 a separate servico was appointed for the consecration of graveyards, in which no mention of the Lord's Supper occurred, but it was simply said, " The ordinary service for the day shall be read at the chureb, except whenL its otherwise ordered," and then a few additions were perescribed. Hiewas aware it mzight be said that a bishop in drawing up a form of consecration could adopt any formn he chose; but that discretion applied only to. buildings which were intended for the full perfor3nance of the rites and ceremonidls of the church of Englad, and not to the miode of consecrating graveyards. In 1712 the Upper House of ConvocAtion recommended a form for the consecration of a ehurchyard singly,"apartfrom thechkrch, and that form, as he had stated, did not contain a word about the administration of the Lord's Supper. Te act of Parliament provided that the gravey.ards should be consecrated, but excluded the cemetery chapels from consecration; and it was evidentthat, when the fonn of consecration of 1712-which was the basis of all fonns now used-wvas drawn up, the administration of the Lord's Supper at the consecration of a graveyard was not contemplated. WVhat, then, could be the use of setting up in cemetery chapek communion tables at which the Lord's Supper could be administered only once? He understood that the burial board and the parishioners of Blandford were ready to comply withthe request of the bishop for the erection of a communion table in the cemetery chapel, but they protested against being called upon to subimit to an enisconal 3nandate for the erection of. a communion table foir wilch they saw no necessity. (Hear, hear.) The petitioners prayed, therefore, that their lordships would take into consideration the provisions of the act of Parliament, with the view of relievig them from obedience to an episcoa mandate which, in their opinion, was not justiHied oiy law. drThe ifshop of SAiASBURY said, he did not rise to addrePss theirlordAhips forthefirsttime without sonic embarrass ment. He felt deeply concerned that the prayer of the petitionci'shad beensupported by thenoble earl, whom he greatly admired for the interest he took in aJl good works, and whose sympathy and co-operation-the nloble earl being one of the moat influential laymen in his diocess-'he vas most analous to obtain. :He (the Bishop of Salisbury) thought he would be able to show that the petitioners had no cause of complaint against him; butthat if there was any ground of complaint it was on his own side. TI1853 an act of Parliament was Dassed relating to burials beyond the limits of the metropolis, and with that act certain provisions of former acts were incorporated, which have X power to bishops with reference to the fitness of brialgrounds for consecration and to the plans of chapels. No difference whatever had arisen between the burial board and himself with regard to the buriniground, althoigh all the arrangements connected withi that ground were not prec3sely what he could have desired, but vey great difficulties had occurred with zespect to the cemetery chapeL Some persona looked upon suclh chapels merely as receiving chapls-as buildings intonded to afford shelter to the clerymen and 3cnurnerg during the performance of the br service. The words of the acb declaredcthe chapel to be for the celebration of the burial service of the united church of England and Ireland; and part of that service had to be, p- formed in the iapel.

LYTTON gave notice that to-morrow (thisday), upon the motion for the adjournment of the House, he should put a question to the noble lord at the head of Her Majesty's Government with respect to our present relations with the United State3. IRISH TENANT-RIGHT. Mr. STAFFORD asked whether the Government intended to propose any amendments in the Tenant-right (Ireland) Bill ; and, if so, whether they would place them on the notice-paper before Wednesday next, on which «lay the bill stands for committee ? Mr. HORSMAN thought it necessary to make some explanatory remarks before replying specifically to the ques" tions of the hon. gentleman. TheHouse would remember that, at the commencement of the session the noble lord at the head of the Government, upon being asked whether he intended to legislate during this session upon the subject of tenant-right, stated that the occurrences of last year had not given the Government any encouragement to hope to legislate succes<_ully,.and therefore it did not intend to introduce or to take charge of any measure upon the subject. The hon. member for Mayo having obtained leave to introduce a bill, the House had a fair right to expect from the Government, upon the question of the second reading, some explanation of its intentions, and he {Mr. Hors?nan), bemg responsible fbr the omission of any such explana-tion, begged to express his regret for that omigãon, which haa occurred from an «mwillingneas to speak in the absence of tifose hon. gentlemen who had taken an active interest upon iNs subject in former years. He was in ex- pectation that some of those hon. gentlemen would -have entered the house, and therefore he waited, believing it very improbable that the discussion would terminate with the speech of. the hon. mover of the ??. The hon. member for Mayo (Mr. G. Moore) expressed a desire that no discussion of the provisions of the bill should take place on that occasion,' but that the House should simply reaffirm a resolution it had affirmed in the preceding session-that the relations between landlord and tenant iu Ireland were not on a satisfactory footing. The Government had no difficulty about reaffirming that resolution, although he (Mr. Horsman) could not think that such a declaration of opinion would lead to any practical result. (Hear, hear.) He had been quite prepared to state the view of the Government, that proceed-ng to committee upon the biU would be a mere waste of time, but a general cry of "Agreed" arose npon the other side of the House, and therefore, seeing the general feeling of the House, the Government deferred to it. As, however, the Government had opposed last year the measure of the hon. member for Kilkenny (Mr. Serjeant Shee), which was not so extensive in its character as that of the hon. member for Mayo, it was not likely that they should support the objectionable provision of the present bill. (Hear.) H, when the motion for going into committee upon that ?? was made, the hon. member for Nortlumptonidure would move its committal on that day six months, he would have the support of theGovernment. (" Hear," and loud laughter.) Mr. DRUMMOND thought it would be as well to know whether the House was to look to the hon. member for Northamptonshire or to the Secretary for Ireland for a declaration of the intentions of the Government upon Irish matters. ("Hear," and laughter.) THE UNITED STATES. Mr. DISRAELI,-Seeing thenoblelord at the head of the Government in his place, I take the opportunity of inquiring whether it be true that our Minister at Washington has quitted that capital at the request of the President of the United States; and, if that report be true, whether it is the intention of the Government to make any statement to the House to-day as to the relations at present existing between this country and the United States ? Lord PALMERSTON.-HerMajesty's Government have received information indirectly of the fact to which the question of the right hon. gentleman has reference, that Mr. Crampton had received his passports and had quitted Washington for Toronto. There has been nothing received from him as yet, and I have no further statement to make at present. THE CHELSEA (?-MEAN INQUIRY. Mr. PALK inquired when the report of the Military Commission presided over by General Sir Alexander Woodford would be laid upon the table of tho house? Mr. PEEL was not aware that the Board of General officers had as yet made any report. MR. LONGWORTH'S MISSION TO THE CIRCASSIANS. XordC. HAMILTON asked, whether it was intended to make pubhc any report which Mr. Longworth might have made of his mission to the Circassian chiefs ? "l^>rdPAI,MERSTON.-It would not be proper to lay any such report before Parliament. Those reports would furnish Kttle information ; hut however that might be they must relate to intercourse wliich Mr. Longworth had with persons on the spot, and therefore it would be unadvisable to produce them, asit was obvious that the relations of individuals with the Russian Government as dependents or : s enemies might be prejudiced by any such step. THE BRITISH FLEET. Sir ? NAPIER asked the First Lord of the Admiralty if 1 e had any objection to by on the table of the house,__ Returns of the vessels of war of all descriptions put out of «ommission since the signing of the treaty of peace; of «oastguard men discharged from the fleet; of riggers ; nd men who have completed five years' sersrice, and have 1 een discharged; of the continuation men now in the ? ervice, with their rating; andof the number of men the ? hips now in comniission are short of complement ï Ajlmiral BERKELEY said, it wonld bo inconvenient ? give those returns at present, the Accountant-General's ? ffice being so fully occupied, but he thonght he could give he hon. and gallant member an answer to each of his ? uestions. With respect to the first question, as to the number of vessels of war of all descriptions put out of commission since the signing of the treaty of peace, it would le very objectionable to make any snch return. In reply to the second question, he might say, that all the coast¡uardmen had been discharged from the fleet, as had also ihe riggers and others referred to in the third question of the hon. and gallant meniber. As to the number of men engaged for continuous service now in the fleet, there would be no objection to give that return; but with regard to the last requirement, of the deficiencies in the complement of shipsnow on commission there was a great objection to giving any such return. (Hear.) The hon. and gallant member had not put the last question which he placed on the paper yesterday. Did he wish that answered ? Sir C. NAPIER,-No! But I give notice that, on going intoCommittee of Supply, I shall move forthe papers which the gallant officer has refused. (Cheers.) SCOTCH ??,???? STORES. Mr. ? BRUCE begged to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether there would be any objection to giving store accommodation in Fort George for the custody of the clothing, arms, and accoutrements of the militia of the counties of Inverness, Nairn, Elgin, and Banff, when the regiment was disembodied ? Sir. G. GREY said, if Fort George were wholly unoccupied it niight be appropriated to that purnose, but it had always been used as a garrison for troops ín the north of Scotland, ROYAL COMMISSION. Sir A. Clifford, Usher of the ..Black Rod, appeared at the table and desired the attendance of the Commons at the bar of House of Lords, to hear the Royal assent given by commission to several bills, for which see Lords' report. The Speaker, accompanied by many hon. members, proceeded thither, and upon their return the business was resumed. THE ABJVIY. Mr. WILSON moved that the Speaker leave the chair, in order that the Hcuse might go into Committee of Supply. Mr. S. HERBERT rose to call attention to the education and instruction of officers in the army, and said,-I have to thank my noble friend the member for Haddingtonshire (Lord Elcho) for allowing me precedence in bringing this subject before the notice of the House, and before I do so I may state, as shortly as I can, the reasons which have induced me to adopta course not strictly regular, in bringing forward on the civil estimates a motion having reference to the army. The House will recollect that at the commencement of the session estimates were laid upon the table, svith a view to the expenditure of the year on the supposition that the war would continue. Since that time we have had a supplementary estimate laid upon the table, stating that much smaller sums will be taken, but we have had no revised detaUedestimate, showing on what items reduction will bemade, what will be altogether omitted, or what increased I observe that there has disappeared from the estimates, an item not large in amount, but which I think, and the majority of the House will think, of great importance-the vote forthe education and instruction of the officers ofthe army. I can understand that whon the war was at its height the Government svas unable to inaugurate any change or to establish a new system, but I regretted extremely to find in the amended estimates, which have been avowedly drawn up since the termination of the war, that this item has been withdrawn. Now I wish, by bringing forward the question this evening, to elicit some expression of opinion as to the necessity of creating some means of offering facilities to officers of the army for performing the higher branches of their profession-in the first plaee, to regimental officers, and still more to officers onthe staff. (Hear, hear.) My hope is, that if in the courso of the debate I should meet from different gentlemen that interest and that support which I trust I may obtain, the Government may be induced, previously to discussing the revised army estimates, to produce a revised estimate which may provide for the education of regimental and staff officers. (Hear, hear.) We have, at this moment, an' immense opportunity before us of creating de novo a peace establishment which shall be free from aH the errors and vices of that wliich was too hurriedly created at the commencement of the great peace. At that time there existed in the country the strongest hostility to the army. In 1816 the petition called the "LondonPetition"waspresented,protestingagainst the maintenance of the army-although that army had been reduced to a great amount-as incompatible with the con. stitution and prosperity of the country, and as sapping the foundation of national hberties ; and so strong was this feeling that the Duke of Wellington held an opinion which he expressed to myself not many years ago, when I proposed that there should be an encampment of a large body of men for instruction in field duties. The Duke of Wellington refused to listen to that proposal, and founded his objection upon the feeling of the country towards the army after the war. He said, " Depend upon it, the only way to maintain an army in this country is to keep it out of sight," I think it probable that the unpopularity of the army at the period in question arose from its having been used as a police force in the repression of political disturbances ; and the opinion of the Duke of Wellington was, that the fact of the army being used as a police force had reconciled the ratepayers of this conntry to its niidntenance. Perhaps it was the custom of the Governments of those days to repress symptoms rather than remove causes that made the army unpopular. Much of the change in the feeling of the country arises from the great improvement of the army, and fror» the increased good conduct of officers and men. (Hear.) At no period of our history was the army ever more popular than at this moment, nor was there ever a warmer or more general sympathy with the army, or a greater desire to see it efficient ; and you are therefore sure to carry popular opinion with yon in trying to make the army efficient. I appro hend that the new organization of the army will greatly facflitats instruction in the higher branches of the eervice. I presume it is intended that the army shall no longer bé scattered in small detachments, and that regiments shall not be dispersed as they" have hitherto been ;. but that yoa intend to agglomerate your forces together as much as possible, and have-something worthy of the name of an army. I do not mean that yoii are to have aa army of greater numbers thanyou have hitherto pÆSs»-_ed ; but I pre sume it is intended that, instead of being broken in isolated bodies, they shallbebrought togetherin brigades and divisions, that they shall be exercised together as brigades, and thai the advantage which the army in Dublin has hitherto aloni possessed shall be extended to the whole force in England. With regard to the amount of the peace establishment, I d > not presume to say what itsnumbers should be. TheGovern ment are the only persons to judge of tha» ; but I trust that, when theymake the reduction toa peace establishment, they will not make the reduction in those corps where the necessity for science is the greatest and the amount of training the longest. (Hear.) You cannot expand upon a sudden a scientific or a hydrographical corps, but you can expand more rapidly the other corps-the cavalry and the infantry of the line ; and the engineers and artillery· »re therefore the last <x>rps upon which the hand of retrenchment ough5 to be placed. (Hear.) I believe we shaU never have, and never ought to have, such an army as the great niilitary nations of the continent possess. Such an army would be foreign to our habits and to our institutions. I do not wish to see such an army ; but we ought to compensate for our numerical inferiority by the highest possible training and efficiency. It is to be presumed that our army will be divided into divisions and brigades for two reasons-firstbecause that is the only decision to which a Minister of War can come that is compatible with common sense ; and, secondly, because it has been announced that this will be carried out in the colonies, and therefore, «x fortiori, I presume it is intended to be carried out at home. Ih asking the House to listen to a plan I am acting contrary to the advice generally given to members unconnected with the Government never to expose any plan of their osvn, because my object is not to avoid criticism, but to put something tangible before the House which may assist them in forming some opinion upon this question. And. when I speak of giving greater facilities to the instruction of the army, I wish to be understood as casting no imputation upon the army as it is now constituted ; that army has done wonderful things (hear, hear), and if there have been any failures, or rather drawbacks, to our successes, they are not the fault of either officers or men. (Hear, hear.) It has been customary to say that this House has been guilty of Twi-simomousness ; that we are blameable foe these shortcomings. That is true in one sense, hut not in the sense in which it is usnally understood. It is said that we should not have had to spend as large an amount as we have been obliged to spend in war if we had maintained a larger army in peace ; but the sum which would render an army efficient, by giving it ihe necessary training, is'small in comparison with the expense òf maintaming a great number of men. The amount required to maintain an efficient army is nothing to that required to maintain a large army completely uninstructed. In drawing a comparison between our army and the armies of foreign countries, I find from all I have heard from military men who have seen it in the field by the side of allies and of enemies that we have in many respects a certain superiority. For instance, with regard to equipments, there is a great variety in the comparative condition of the different armies which were engaged inthe Crimea. In the matter of tentage, the Turks stand first, ihe English second, the French third; in that of clothing, theFrench are first, the English second, the Turks third ; and in that of arms, the English are without cfmparison first, the French second, the Turks third. With the Russians no comparison was possible, but in the three armies I have mentioned we have every possible variety of advancement in the one pointof equipment. I beheve, too, that, in spite of the privation, suffering, and disease endured by the English army, its mortality was less in proportion to its numbers than that of any of the other armies engaged, includrng the Russian. (Hear, hear.) I am not therefore going to bring any charges against the army ; on the contrary, I think it is wonderful that men with no means of learning tho higher branches of their profession should have adapted themselves so rapidly to a new state of things, and, by their determination, energy, courage, and constancy, should have achieved such immense results. {Hear, hear.) I will not deal, except in passing, with the question of the instruction of the men, because a plan is already in operation which is, no doubt, susceptible of great improvement, but-wlucli is being improved and extended every day-we are, at any rate, in the right groove. One observation, however, I must make. In a pamphlet, very well worth reading, entitled Thouglds on Military Administration, by a Field Officer, dated Aldershott, 1855, some criticisms are offered npon the proceedings at that encampment. The author remarks," Our soldiers, in other respects so efficient, are notoriously wanting as compared with the troops of other European countries in contrivance and resource, and less fitted, therefore, to cope with many of i&esüînciilties and privations to which all armies in the field must at times be exposed." Obviously they are, because the high state of civilization at which this country has arrived prevents them from learning those make-shifts which, in less ciirilized countries, are the habitual arts of the peasantry. " And yet," continues the author,- " I. believe that, with nearly 10,000 soldiers and militia on the spot during the past summer months, civil labour has been employed almost exclusively at the camp. You build, ilraih, construct roads, bake, butcher, and wash by contract, and contract alone. Now, I do not enter into the question as to whether this is the most economical expedient that can be resorted to under such circumstances ; but it certainly is not calcnlated to impart that knowledge or those habits to the troops of which they stand so much in need." (Hear, hear.) I heartily concur in that opinion. At the same time there is this to be said for the Governmentthey had to deal with a large mUitia force, and it was more important at that moment to convert labourers into soldiers than soldiers into labourers. But there was also a large body of the line, and I certainly regret the great opporiunity which was lost of teaching them how to drain, make roads, construct bridges, and build huts for themselves. (Hear, hear.) In future they must be taught something more than their drill -the army must be made self-sufficient for its own purposes. Before passing from this subject I must express my regret at one of the items in these estimates. Additional inspectors have been appointed for the regimental schools, but, although the object of theGovernment must be to make the army more military, more professional than it is, those appointments have been given not to military men, hut to two gentlemen who were War-office clerks-no doubt most efficient and indefatigable in that situation, hut no more fit to inspect schools than T am. (Hear, hear.) These inspectorships should be kept as prizes for officers who have shosvn a knowledge of their profession, and who would look upon them as great boons. Ihave seen a minute of the Privy Council with regard to the appointment of inspectors to these schools, and I am glad to find that the plan of sending down the rev. gentiemen, who are mostly Privy Council inspectors, to them has been abandoned, because, if persevered in, it must have produced great inconvenience, and the result of it would probably have been a war between the Horse Guards andthe Privy Council. I now come to the question of whether or not means of instruction should be afforded to officers of the army. A few years ago any project with that object would have been very difficult to carry out. I hope it is not so now. I think the popular fallacies upon this subject have died away. An idea was once prevalent that there is some sort of antagonism between knowledge and action (hear, hear) ; that if a man was instructed in his duty be was likely to become a pedant and a bookworm, and no longer to be an active, zealous, handy officer. Now, it cannot be denied that there is no effective substitute for experience ; and that war is ihe best school for soldiers ; but although armies are created for purposes of war their habitual state is a state of peace-war is not the rule but the exception, and long may it continue to be so. The only substitute an officer can have for his own experience in war is the experience of other men, and by every nation except England that principle is recognized Some people caU it a theoretical principle, but Napoleon no mere theorist in the art of war- was a highly instructed officer, and he remodelled all the inilitary colleges and schools of France ; many of them he created, and from them he obtained that plialanx of officers who led the French armies to victory. I have read an ahle report on the subject of education at Sandhurst, and I will quote one or two sentences from the evidenco upon which it is founded in which much valuable matter is to be found. I must first, however, remind the House that, in 1850, the Duke of Wellington issued his " confidential memorandum," in which he proposed, in the first place, to examine young men who were candidates for coinmissions, and then to have a further examination on promotion to the rank' of lieutenant or (»ptain. Here is the opimon of Colonel Adams upon this subject :- "Generally speaking,"says Lieutenant-Colonel Adams, the officers of the army have no éducation at all, and they have nothing to interest them." (" Hear,1' and a laugh.) But recollect what is done with young men who intend to enter the army. I ask any gentleman who remembers his own education whether the great bulk'of what he knows was not acquired after, not before, the age of 18. (Hear.) Why? Because at that age he began to feel responsibility pressing upon him, he began to prepare himself for |the struggle upon which hewas about to enter. What happens now when a young man enters the army? That is just the time when he shuts up his book ; and be is told that he is " an officer and a gentleman," and undoubtedly he almost invariably acts up to that character worthily. Bathowgreattohim i« the disadvantage of thus closing bis5tiidies at that time î Just at the period when the mind is most susceptible of improvement and good impreeoonj he as oebarred from i^rucfaon, and forced to leVrn nothinif boiides fte bare routine of his regimental duties. (Hea£ hear.) Colonel Adams proceeds to say:__ v*«"·.*· "If they know «mything it is » little Latin, Muling more, and liowarethey to amuse themselves.

He said that the Duke of Wellington could not solve a» problem of Euclid when he was at the head' of the army. I dare say nut, and I do not know why he shonid when .·'at the head of the army. The object of teaching· 3~b an officer mathematics is not so much to enable hiuv to solve a problem in Euclid as to train him f or reoeiving; a scientific military bstruction. Tho illustration, however, is not a happy one, as the Duke of Wellington had· that scientific education, which he obtained at Angers. SirJ. Burgoyne further states :- '?* would be a great advantage if the officers« generally of the line, in-? siege, for instance, -imder-tood the principles of fortification; many of them were» quite at a loss during the operations in the Criu.ea to perform the duties that are really reqiiired to make the bestuse of their position, which they would understand better if they knew more of fortification; but it is hardly to be expected that every officer of the hne should attain miicb knowledge of it." I do not see how he is to attain such knowledge if yodo not give him the means of acquiring it. I do not say that it is necessary for every officer to acsraire the sameamount of scientific mformation as engineer and ??????officers, but they should all know enough to understand those parts ofthe operations which they are to carry out, sothat they might be enabled to avoid mistakes and prevent· unnecessary sacrifice of life. (Hear, hear.) I «mil only quote another sentence, because it is important as bearingon the canje of our drawbacks to success in the Crimea. In Captain Morton Spearman's notes on inilitary education ifc is stated:- " The Btrength oí every army depends more on the instruction and talent of its officers than on its numerical/' value. It is those armies, therefore, in which the educai tion of the officers has been most carefully attended to a«_d developed that are most to be depended on in the hour oE need. Everywhere except in this country this is a recognized truth. On the continent it is practically acknowledged. Many persons have remarked the differenoe ins result between the earlier and later campaigns of the British. army in the last war ¡few, the means by which that difference was initiated. To dispute the zeal and devotion of either the officers or men engaged in those earlier campaigns is impossible. Butthe fact is, that, in 1793, neither the» regimental officers nor the officers employed on the generastaff of the British army were sufficiently "lKtructedeither m the theory or in the practice of their profession. To the want of such instruction, especially of theoretical instruction, experience has since shown tbat the early disasters of the war are alone to be attributed." The following is a curious sentence dictated by Napoleon tev' "* Montholon, at St. Helena :- " Brought to Franoe when 14, Louis entered on the life« ofa man at the siege of Toulon on hearing me say to him, in the midst of the corpses of 200 grenadiers slain through the ignorance of their commander, at the assault of an impregnable side of Fort Pharon :-« If I had commanded; here, all these brave men would be still alis'e. Learn, Louis, from this example, how absolutdy necessary instruction is to those who aspire to command others.' " (Hear.) Well, my osvn belief is that the opinions as to the non-necessity of instruction to officers have been dissipated by the experience of the last war. (Hear, hear.) I believe-- that many gentlemen would not now be found bold enough to express the opinion, if it be entertained by any, asto the mischief and danger resulting from military instruction... I am not going to contend for high literary acquirements. What I wish for is strictly professional and» practical knowledge, and when people argue that the cultivation of the intellect detracts from the activity of the body I must say I am at a loss to know where an exampleis to befound for this physiological curiosity. ("Hear, hear" and. alaugh.) There may be persons of very great intellectual and very httle physical powers, but I cannot understand why~ the. muscles of a sound, active, and vigorous man shonid shiink, or his spirits abandon him, merely because he istaught the reason and cause of the work he is engaged in. (Htar, hear.) One half of the complaints of the conduct of officers has resulted from the forced idleness of their position. (Hear, hear.) Cases in which these complaints havebeen made will bein the recollection ofthe Honse. I will notmentionthe names of the regiments, because the manner in which they afterwards boregreat privationandsufferingdothem the greatest honour, and entitle them to'the oblivion of any follies they may have committed in a time of peace. I will just explain shortly what thepresent system is, and' how I propose to amend it. The young men intended forthe artillery and engineers are entered at the school atC"arshalton, and thence go to the academy at Woolwich. Those intended for the line go at the age of 13 years to Sandhurst, where they remain till they are old enough for their commissions. Now, in reference to the age at which these boys are takeninto the military establishments, I do not. believe that it is the business of the State to give education to children ; I do not beheve that the State can give it effectually or well. I do not believe that at Carshalton orSandhurst the boys acquire the same healthy tone of feeline or of morals by one-half as they do at public schools. I therefore think it advisable that they should not be sent to Carshalton or Sandhurst until after the period when a boy's·-. education is completed at a public school or at home. With respect to Carshalton, I propose that it shouldbe abolished as a preliminary school to Woolwich, and with respect to Sandhurst I propose that, instead of taking hoys of 13 years · of age, they should be taken at 16 years. At present theyare put to discipline properly appucable to persons of more«-" advanced years ; and I beheve the system does not work '\ well, but fails. I have heard ihat the youths from Sandhurst, when they join their regiments, are not looked upon welL They are considered conceited, and not to have tho same gentlemanly tone as boys from other schools. The reason, however, of their being considered conceited isbe-- cause they standin a peculiar porition ; whereas, ifall wero educated, ignorance of militarymatterswouldnotbedeemeda. matter of gentility. 1 will not enter into aU the defects of the establishment at Sandhurst, but will say one word about the system of passing by what is called " steps"that is to say, the boys are instructed first in one» language,, carried to a certain point and there left, and then instructed in another. It is a systemof cramming, and when a boy is crammed to a certain extent m one branch of instruction he is compelled to shootout all the rubbish he has taken in »nd to go to another. That is radically wrong, and I believe the masters st Sandhurst are convinced of it. You have an examination there«. of ahigh standard to which boys may submit themselves, and if they pass it they get a commission without purchase. That is the only examination out of Sandhurst ; but the boy who knows that his father can purchase for him, or has interest at the Horse Guards, -will not trouble himself topass that examination ; and I believe there aro instances of a boy who has been plucked at Sandhurst afterwards getting; a commission, either by interest or purchase, having gonethrough the minor examination which is established for those who enter the army without having been at Sandhurst. There are, therefore, two entirely different modes of getting into the army ; and I beheve that a great proportion of boys who knowthat there is no absolute necessity for them to go through the examination at Sandhurst do nottrouble themselves about it. What I propose is to reduce the course at Sandhurst to 18 months ortwo years, taking the boys at 16 years, and tomake several alterations in the education, the tendency of which would be to make it more practic»! and less theoretical ; and after the course at Sandhurst thoseboys who showed the greatest aptitude for chymistry, mathematics, and so on, would go to Woolwich to prepare for the artillery, and those who showed the greatest aptitude« for architecture and the like would go to Chatham to prepare for the engineers. I would have also a third school for the cavalry, where those officers who are destined for that arm shonid learn veterinary surgery, and all such matters, which are necessary for a cavalry officer fo know.- Thisschool, of course, would most naturally be placed at Maidstone, which is our great cavalry depot. 1 would proposethat no one should be admitted into ihe army who had not passed the e-aimination out of Sandhurst, or an e-^unination. equal to it. It has been argued that every imm who goes into the army should pass through Sandhurst, but I do notthink that would do. (Hear.) Itwould tie parents up too much, and I do not think it would be suited to our English habits. Besides, as an examination between boyskeeps boys up to the mark, so an examination betweea schools keeps masters up to the mark, which is t^uailyimportant. (Hear.hear.) At the open examinations at Woolwich-whicii the pressure of the war rendered neoessarynot very long ago-it was found, to the greatly astonishment of the examiners, that some of the stranger boys were considerably ahead of the boys at ihe academy, and I beexamination should not be conducted by the Sandhurst proHeve that that hasnot been withoutits effect on the professor at Woolsvich. In order to secure perfect impartiality, t' feEsors. Yon must have a separate board of examiner1.. snd this board would play a considerable part in my plañ. Having got the officer into the army, then conies the quesI tion how we are to deal 'with him afterwards. At thi?: moment you have for promotion a certain, or rathecan uncertain, examination. It is an examination,. for example, of an officer whether he knows ihe· different duties ofa company, the places of officers in a battalion, and so on, but whatever examination there -j is it is a defective one. It is an examination ordered to tak|t>S Íilac6'*by someJcaptaïn in the regiment, and it doesnot atari ollow that the caption is very much more obstiucted'thart the officer who ig to be examined. That may or may not be ; but, at all eventsj the character of the examinatiohiiiust vary very much in each -regiment. The Duke of Wellington, in his confidential memorandum, contemplated one'.universali systemof examination throughout the army. Manypersons: »re apt to suppose that, because little was done in this «Uree-. tion during the time that the Dnke was »tthe Horse Guards therefore he was opposed to a system of examinations^ hut that is not so. He began by proposing, first of all, that J

LON2DOIV, FRIDAY, JUNYE G, 1856. in the House of Lords yesterday, The Royal assent was given by commission to the Annuities Bill (No. 2), the Bankers' Compositions Bill, the Fire Insurances Bill, and several private acts. The Commissioners were the LoP.D CHANcErmon, the Dulhe of AuitG-ii, and Lord C.An,PBELL. The LoRD CnuNscELtOR laid on the table four bills, intended to carry into effect the proposals of the Charity Commission for the better application of charityfu nds now improperly, or not beneficially, employed. Thle bills were read a fist time. The Earl of HAr.DWic-E asked if the report in the public journals that Mr. CrAMToN0 had been disznissed by the Governuent of the United States was authentic. Earl Gm-NYTLLE stated that the Government had received no official announcement of the fact. The report of the amendments to the Peers' Appellate Jurisdiction Bill was considered. The LonnD ON CuILOR moved the insertion of a clause empowering a peer who had filled the office of Lord Chancelior to take the office of DeputySpeaker, though he mightnot have sat for five years as a Judge. A short discussion fo31owed on the principle of the bill itself; Lord DraMAN and the Earl of WcEOwL strongly condemned it. The Earl of MiNro moved the addition to the bill of a proviso declaring that nothing in the act should be construed as limiting the rights of the prerogative. Earl GnAi-vNuzthought the proviso umnecsa. It was therefore withdrawn and the report received, Laord DEx~r giving notice that on the next stage of the bill he should move it be read a third time on that day six months, and that he would divide the E[ouse on the question. The Earl of SAF=snE Rny presented apetitio from the mayor and inhabitants of Blandford, complaiiing of the non-consecration of their new bnrialground. -It appeared that the Bishop of S &:rSBnua had required a communion-table to be placed in the chapel attached to the cemetery, to which the Burial Board and the inhabitants object. The Earl of SaAmSBuRY contended that the cemetery alone was required to be consecrated, and quoted several authorities supporting this view of the question. The Bishop of SABISBURY declared that administering the Communion was an essential part of the service of consecration, and wliat he required to be done was strictly necessary to the proper performance of this rite of the Church. After a discussion of some length, in which Lord PolrMAN, Lord REDESDAxx, the Bishop of OXFRD, and the Bishop of ST. As&&n took part, the petition was laid on the table. The Marquis of CLANEIC:DoE asked if the Earl of CLAnmoiiN could communicate to the House the notes of the Sardinian-Envoy of the 22d of 3March and the 1Gth of April, presented to the Congress of Paris, with the answers returned to them. The Earl of CLAMEN-DON apologized for not having communicated these documents sooner, but thought it was of little impoi'tance, as they had already appeared in the newspapers. With respect to the answers, the French and English Governments agreed that, the questions having been full:y discussed at the Congress, it was not necessary to send any answer to them. But it had since appeared that the Sardinian Government wished to have some wlitten record of the arguments, and he hacno hesitation in repeating, in the name of MIi MIAJaSTV's Government, what he had said at Paris. That amnver he now laid on the table. Before Parliament separated the affairs of Italy would, no doubt, be discussed; but all he could state at present was that he believed both France and Austria wvere sincere in their desire to withdraw their troops from the portions of Italy occupied by them, and that they were now preparing to do so. The House then adjourned. In the House of Commons, AMr. DISRAELi inquired whether it -was true that our Minister at Washington had quitted that capital at the request of the PREsmE-rsT of the United States of America, and, if so, -whether it -was the intention of HER LAaSTvy's Government to make any communication to the House on the subject of our relations with the United States. Lord PAIAMESTON replied that he had received information indirectly of the fact that MIr. CRAMTTON had received his passports, and had quitted Washington for Toronto; -but nothing had been receivedfrom him as yet, and he (Lord P.ArnSToN) had zao further statement to make. On the order for going into Committee of Supply, Mr. S. HERBERT, in bringing before the House, pursuant to notice, the subject of the education and instruction of officers in the army, stated the reasons which had induced him to adopt a course not strictly regular. In the Estimates he had observed that, for the first time, the vote for this purpose had been withdrawn, and his object was to elicit from the HIouse an expression of an opinion that it was necessary to offer facilities to officers to perfect themselves in the higher branches of the profession, especially those of the Staff. We had at this moment, he observed, an immense opporutiu nlity of creating de noro a peace establisnhment free from the vices of that formed at the commencement of the great peace, when there wasthe strongest hostility against the army. He was not going, he said, to dealwith instruction for themen, except to express hisregret that an opportunity had been lostat Aldershott cf teacling the men matters of contrivance and resource, in which they were deficient, and that War-office clerks, instead of militaryinspectors, had been appointed to inspect the regimental schools. He cited authorities, including the great NAro=EoN;, show.ing the absolute necessity of instruction for offlcers of the line, not, he observed, in high literary acquirements, but in matters strictlyprofessional and practical; and he then proceeded to explain in detail the nature of the present system, and how he proposed to amaend it, with reference to the instruction of candidates previously to admission, and after an officer entered the army. Among other suggestions, he proposed that there should be a board of officers for conducting the examination for commissions and for promotion; and, with regard to the staff, he did not propose to make a separate Staff' corps, but, moving the Staff school back to iFarulham, he proposed that it should be a rule that no officer should be eligible for the Staff unless he had passed through that school and had served as a supernumerary in each arm of the service -one year in theinfantry, one inthe cavalry,and one in the artilery. PRecapitulating the several parts of his plan, he asked the Hiouse to take it for what it was worth, pressing the Government at the same time to receive that or some similar plan, assuring them of the- support of public opinion. Mr. F. PEED said he did not feel capable of 'following Mr. HERBERT through a speech so full of details. The question -was indeed one of detail, for as to the expediency of improving the professional training of officers of the army a'l were agreed, but everything depended upon the mode in which the principle was worked out. He admitted that the Government had done much lesvs in this respect for the officers than for the privates, and that the country had a right to expect that ample means should be provided of enabling officers to obtain that knowledge which was necessary for the discharge of their professional duties, and, with regard to the Staff, that Staff appointments should be honestly conferred upon officers who had availed themselves of the means of education. Mr. PEEL then reviewed I the plan developed by Mr. HERBERT, guarding him- self against being supposed to express any definite opinion, suggesting objections to some parts of the plan and concurrence with others, and declaring that it was the intention of the Government to devote their best consideration to the subject, but not to act with hurry and precipitation. Mr. EI.IICE dwvelt upon the vices of the existing system. It was essential, he said, that the country should set to vwork in earmest to place the establishment in the most efficient state. Sir DE LAcv EVl,s condemned the present mode of examination, and urged the Government to accelerate its movement in this matter. Colonel DUNNE, MIr. RIcE, Lord HOTM.Sr, and Lord GoDmuen made a few general remarksupon tOpies connected with the subject. _,Lord PA1nERsTON thanked Mir. HERBERT for the able and clear manner in which he had stated his views. The Government, he said, concurred with him and other speakers in bearing their testimony to the high importance of officers in the arTay having the best possible education adapted to their professional functions, and they admitted that the present system was capable of improvement, and that it was their duty to use their utmost exertions to make the best arrangements for effecting that improvement. The House couild not expect, he said, that he should follow the detailsinto which Mr. HERBERT had entered; but they should receive the best consideratiou of the Government. Two things wvere to be desired in officers of the army. Some persons argued in favour of higlh literary qualications; but this object, though not to be neglected, might be carried too far. A certain extent of literary acquiremrents was a test of competency; but the instruction should be directed more to professional acquirements. What was especially vanted in an officer was the possession of what he would call constitutional qualities-such as firmness, resolution, and rapidity of decision in emergencies, of which no examination could furnish a test, and which might existwheretherewas a deficiency of the others. It was desirable to combine both. He assured the House that the Govermment were duly impressed with the deep importance of placing the army in a state of the utmost efficiency, and of coming as soon as possible to some satisfactory arrangements upon the subject. The subject then dropped. s r. MooiiE put a question to 3fr. H orUSMAN re- specting an explanation made by him at an earlyr
The latest accounts from America seem to promise some respite from the ceaseless advance of the Government in the path of discord and aggression. 31Ir. CicrrpTox is, indeed, dismissed, but we are {old that that act is no longer to be considered the farst in a series of proceedings intended to force England to recede still fturther, and to hiunble herself dishonourably before a rival whom no apologies could satisfy and no professions of good will could conciliate. It seems to be necessary to recede somewhat from the grounds originally taken up, and to admit that HERTZ and STRoBEL, the infainous witnesses upon whose testimony Mr. Cxs3r3ros's veracity is impugned and his character soug,ht to be destroyed, cannot be relied on; and we are now therefore told that the accusation does not rest on the evidence of ThmRTz and STROBEL, but " upon MIr. CRurmroN's " own admissions," as contained in a letter ivnitten by him, and produced at the HERTZ trial. On a forner perusal of the trial the existence of any such ciiminating documnent had entirely escaped us, and we have therefore sought again for a letter of so much importance. The only docmnents which seem to have been produced in evideuce bearing the signature of MIr. CRAMrTeo. wrere the tvo following:- " Saturday, January 27, 1855. "Sir,-I shall be happy to see you at any time you may choose to call to-day or to-morrow. "I am, &c., "JOHN F. CRAMPTON." The second is equally explicit:- "' Washington, February 4, I 55. <Sir,-With reference to our late conversation I am now enabled to give you some more definite information as to the suibject to wlhich it related. "I am, &c., " JOHS. F. CRAMPTOIN. " NolV, it is very easy to say these letters con-lained admissions " wlhich convict Air. CR.TO," especially wihen the letters themselves are not produced; but w-e ask any reasonable man who has read theem to say whether there is anytliing in the alightest degree criminatory in them. There is no insudt to tlie majesty of the United States in desiring a man to call at the Britislh Legation, nor yet in informing hinm that the writer is able to give mnore definite information on the subject of a late conversation. These letters are, on the face of them, perfectly fair and innocent, and need the exposition of credible testimiony to give them any other sense. But that credible testimony is unfortunately not forthcoming; and, if HERTZ and STROnEL are not vwitnesses of sufficient veracity to fix Mr. CRA=PTOx with any offence by their suLbstantive testimony, neither can they establish with reference to these letters a construction leading to an inference unfavourable to his conduct. If these witnesses are believed, the letters are superfluous; if disbelieved, they are useless. This is now the second effort which has been made to shift the issue deliberately joined with reference to Mir. CRnarprox. First, w-e are told that the case can be proved by undoubted testimony ; next, that his own letters convict lhim; and, thirdly, that his assertions are at variance -with those of persons present at different intenriews with him. It is a paltry and miserable game thus to triump up one after anotlher against the MKinister of a friendly State charges, accusations, and inshiuations, in order to get an excuse for Ihis dismissal, and thlLs to conciliate the support of men who can only be bought by a prospect of immediate war w-ith this colntry. MIr. CR.AMPTON may well claim an acquittal at the hands of the United States Ministry themselves, if these and suchl accusations as these are all that can be brought forward. The American press endeavours to persuade itself that England wil be ready to appoint a successor in the place of Mr. CRlAMrrTOX, and suggests that the three Consuls can be retained in their situations, by way of compromise. In the first of these views we apprehend that the -writers considerably overestimate the pLacability of the English Governmient and people. Wle will not, on the one hand, offer insult or offence ; but, on the other, we are not disposed tamely to suibmit to it. Those who endeavour to persuade themselves that n-e shall learn the dismissal of MIr. CRA1PTON- wsithout enforcing the retirement of 11Ir. DALTAS are calculating upon an amount of endurance totally inconsistent with the character of Englishmen. Did -we believe that 3Ir. CRtuprrox had really been guilty of any offence against the United States, there would need little pressure or remonstrance to induce us at once to remove him from the situation he would have dishonoured; but, if an attempt be made to sacrifice him to the emergencies of local politics, we shall feel that his quiarrel is our own, and certainly not pass it over without (lstinctly marl;ing our sense of the indignity. Mleanwhile, we are happy to see that in quarters not immediately rnder the influence of the Government the able and conciliatory despatch of Lord CLAR}_NDON has produced the result which w-e had a right to expect from it. Even journals most opposed to us are bound, hoevever ungraciously, to admit the extreme ability with wlhiich the (locument is fiamed, anl theconciliatory spirit uhiclh pervades it throughout. It is generally admitted that Mr. lIEacv has becn, in Transatlantic phrase, " cornered," and that the denial of the veracity of his witnesses has left him nno alternative but to break off a correspondenec from w.hich hol has obtained so little success. Others even go so far as to think the necessitv for the dismissal of MIr. CRA.rrroN cntirely obviated, and the whole affair arrived at the very verge of an amicable settlement. Happy indeed should we be to believe that this was the case, and that the obvious and unaffected reluctance of the English Government to compromise its friendly relations with the Cabinet of Washington, together with the good sense and good feeling of the Ainerican people, had dbiven their Government to renounce its present aggressive and menacing attitude. We hardly hope for so muchl, but wve do expect that the clhange of feeling obviously talking place in thc Urnited States, and the conviction which is forcing itself upon men's minds, in spite of every effort to exclude it, that it is not from England the stornm has arisen, wlln tell upon the coming elections, and provide us with a Government which, at any rate for the next four years, may allow the two nations to apply themselves to the peacefuLl pursuits of conimerce and industry, without being perpetually roused from their dream of tranquillity by the wrang,ling of diplomatists or the preparation for suicidal warfare. We may, and probably slall, escape the present danger, but it is presuming too muich on our good fortune to suppose that we can be Tor ever on the brink of war and yet preserve a firm and durable peace. The risk may ue often rim and often escaped; but, if the American people will persist in placing the best interests of their country in the hands of men who treat great affairs with such inconceivable levity,-if they will listen to those who are for ever telling them that they have a " manifest des" tiny" to oppress their weak-er neighbours, and take fiomn them by conquest those territories which it is so much easier and more honourable to develope by internal energy,-ths day must come when they will be confronted by conimunities as vigorous as their own, and find, when it is too late, how much easier it is to grow by the arts of peace than the doubtful and dangerous appliances of aggression.
Mr. SIDNEY HERBERT last night, in a very able speech, developed his ideas upon military education. Our task in dealingvwith this statement is simple and satisfactory enough, inasmuch as most of the ideas propounded by MIr. SID-NEY HERBERT to the House of Commons have been long since advocated in the columns of Die Times. It is, however, always something to arrive at a Parliamentary recognition of truth. Times and seasons in their revolution bring with them strange alterations in the views and declarations of public men. Here we have an instance of an army reformer in the person of a gentleman -who for many years held high office in the administration of military affairs, and who, whatever his private sentiments may have been, has been an upholder and defender of the system. In common with other statesmen and MIinisters, Mlr. SlmNEY HERBERT refused to listen to the vulgar outcry and clamoiur for military reform. It was look-ed upon as a sort of hightreason against the upper classes to assert that for the most part our military officers had still to learn the duties of their profession. You were assailed with old anecdotes of the Peninsular War, and assertions of the enormous advantage accruing to the service from the English system of purchase and interest. It was idle to attempt argument with men who only talked up to a foregone conclusion. The embodied Colonels in the Hiouse of Commons were prepared to rush forward as a single man in defence of that system to which they owed their rank and position in society, and woe betide that profane individual who dared to lay but a finger on the military ark. So omnTipotent is custom -so convincing is wealth-so weighty is station in this coumtry, that the task of opposition to these military errors was too much for human strength. Nothing remained for it but patiently to await the calamity wvhichl must one day surely come, when the attention of the nation would be fixed upon the causes which had brougiht upon us suchi grievous loss and sufEering; and then, indeed, we might be roused to the necessity of fundamental change. The Russian war has ftunished us with the necessary stimLulus, and we have at lengpth been made painfully aware that something more than undoubted pluck, gentlemanly bearing, and a sum at Cox and GREENWOOD'S, is necessary for an English officer who aspires to more than the merest subaltern command. MIr. Simnx I HERsERT in the course of his address to the House last night quoted a very curious sentence dictated by NArorEos to MONTHOLOIN at St. Helena, which we here reproduce for the benefit of the Chelsea Commissioners:- " Brought to France when 14, Louis entered on the life of a man at the siege of Toulon, on hearing me say to him, in the midst of the corpses of 200 Grenadiers, slain through the ignorance of their commander, at the assault of an im. pregnable side of Fort Pharon:-'If I had commanded here, all these brave men would be still alive. Learn, Louis, from this example, how absolutely necessary instruc. tion is to those who aspire to command others.' " MIr. SIDNsEY HEERERT adds, coolly enouigh, his own belief that the opinions as to the policy of employing ignorant officers have been dissipated by the experience of the last war. This may well be so, but a huge price has been paid for the necessary instruction! MIr. SIDN;EY HERBERT, it appears, felt throughout that the system was radically vicious-but what could he do ? The late Duke of WELIaNGTON had got an idea into his head that the only manner in which the people of this country could be reconciled to the notion of a standing army was to keep the soldiers out of sight. Hence oIUr regiments were broken up and scattered by driblets through the country. The army, it seems, was highly unpopular after the conclusion of the European war of 1815, because the troops were employed throughout England to discharge the duties of a police force. So distasteful had they in consequence become to the great body of the people, and so popular a theme was army reduction, that the Duke of WELarMTOr felt that the only chance of retaining an army numerically sufficient for the defence of the empire lay in hiding our soldliers away wherever hiding-places could be fotund. Hence, we had no cantomnients, no camps, no musters on a grand scale,-in a word, neither the English officer nor the iEnglish soldier had any opporiunity at home for learning the duties of his profession. We quote the explanation for two reasons,-first, inasmuch as it is curious in itself as matter of history; and, secondly, because it involves the admission on the parG of an English statesman that he, at least, has long since recognized the deplorable defects of instruction among our officers as a class. The Duke's objection does not seem to have applied with equal force to Sandhlurst; but, from reasons into which it would now be tedious to enter, Sandhurst has not answered the expectations of its founders. Their error lay in holding that it was the duty of lhc State to take boys at a tender age, and educate them especially with a view to military service. The true idea is, that where private instruction ends puiblic instruction should begin. UIntil a certain age it is far wiser to give boys a good general public school education. lWhen they have received competent instruction of a preparatory and general kind, then the State may step in, and summon the pupil to some publicinstitution in which he is to be fitted for the duties of a particular career. *W5e cainot too strongly insist upon this distinction. To proceed :-iIr. SID-NEY HErssr.T considers, and with great justice, that the conclusion of the Russian war affords us an opportunity of repairing our previons errors. Public attention has nowv been actively directed to the subject. There is now no jealousy of the anny, but, on the contrary, a feeling of universal regret that our officersespecially our higher officers-should in the day of trial have been found so deplorably deficient in all military qualities save courage. Air. S. HEIRBERT almost entirely confined hlimself to the question of instructng our officers, although he regretted that great opportunities had been lost at Alderslhott and elsewhere for training our soldiers in habits which would have helped them out of many a difficulty in actLal warfare. We cannot here do more than indicate the chief features of M1r. SIDNEY HERBERT'S proposition in a few sentences. He wishes to reduce the . course at Sandluu-st to 18 months or tvwo years-taking the boys as pupils at 16 years of age. When tlle period of probation at Sandhmust is at an end some of the lads may be draughted off to Chatham for the Engineers, some to Woolwich for the Artillery, some to a great cavalry school which he proposes to establish at Maidstone-our principal cavalry dep6t in England. There is to be an examinat on for commissions, and an examination at suibsequent steps for promotion; and, to carry out this object, a board of examiners, consisting of three persons. There is to be an officer at the head-quarters of each division to act as military instructor. With respect to the Staff, every young man who aspires to hold an appointment upon it, besides special preliminary training, will be bound to serve one year with the infantry, one with the cavalry, and one with the artillery, in order to learn thoroughly the duties of each arm. Thus, we shouLld not only secure the services of competent officers, but at the same time deal a death blow to the system of nepotism and jobbery which has so universally prevailed in Staff appointments. The manner in which the address of Mfr. SiDrNEv HERBERT was received by the Treasury Bench was satisfactory enough. Mr. F. PEEM fully admitted the shortcomings of the Governmenit with regard to the education of military officers. Lord PALMERSTON, who finally replied and brought the discussion to a close, emphatically promised that the subject should receive the instant consideration of himself and his colleagues, and that they would use their utmost exertions to promote every necessary improvement. Our whole military system is, indeed, one of the most important points which can occupy the attention of any Government. The country should be duly grateful to MIr. SiDxEv HERBERT for having so strongly denounced and so elaborately exposed its defects. Many persons who would have turned a deaf and contemptuous ear to reason and remonstrance will courteously acquiesce in the conclusion when propounded upon such high authority.
It is commonly objected to the architecture of this metropolis, especially by foreigners, not only that it is bad but that it is badly situated. WVhen we get a good thing we don't seem to appreciate it. As with oiur men, we have the right buildings in the wrong places, and the wrong buildings in the right places. It may not be our fault that the Monument stands in Pudding-lane, and the Duke of YonR's Column in Waterlooplace; but it is the work of the same generation that the fagade of the British Museum looks upon the spectacle-shops and lodginghouses of Great Russell-street, while the fmest site in Europe is devoted to the poverty-stricken front of the Natibnal GaUery. The Houses of Parliament, which for convenience ought to have been central, and for appearance elevated, are in a corner of the metropolis, a mile from any fashionable part, and actually in the bed of the Thames. Buckingham Palace stands on a deserted arm of the same favourite river, about 18 inches above highwater mark, while the many splendid sites east of the Parks are given up to lords and milionaires. St. Paul's is buried in shops and warehouses, and the magnificent edifices of the city are huddled together, like Swiss mountains, in such a way that in order to get a fair view of the giants you must ascend the secondary range. Abroadwe are aware it is very un-Einglish to quote the example of foreigners-but, we repeat, in the great cities of that barbarous region which extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains the site of a public edifice is thought as important as its design. Theresultisthatmanyabuildingwhichwould absolutely never be heard of in this metropolis enjoys a world-wide fame, and is daily visited by crowcds of admiring travelers. There is nothing very remarkable, perhaps, in the design of Goldsmiths'hail, in a narrow lane behind the General Postoffice; but had it the advantage of a good situation its mere proportions woiuld place it among the ornaments of Eiurope. Again, some hundred thousand persons pass under the Church of St. Mary-le-Strand every day of their lives without ever being conscious of an " aesthetical" impression. Under more favourable circumstances, with room and verge enough, and vwithout smoke, it would be an object for the eye to rest upon with positive satisfaction. But, as far as we know, nobody is so bold as to maintain that our buildings are well placed, or placed at all, and nobody can deny that an ill-placed building is thrown away. We do hope, then, that Parliament will consider well before it commits itself to the project of placing the new National Galery in the grounds of the Royal Commission at Kensington-gore. The proposed site is about half way between Gore-house and Brompton, not more than 15 feet above highwater mark, and looked down upon from the Kensington-road. No doubt it will be possible to get a tolerably open space about it, nor do we suppose there can be any material difference between the air of the locality and that of Kensington. We are looking, however, to effect, and there can be no denying that the points of view from which the proposed edifice will be most generally seen will be on the north; that is, Kensington-road, Rotten-row, and the walks in Kensington-gardens. At these places the spectators will be 15 feet, 20 feet, and even 30 feet above the site of the proposed Gallery, and will, in fact, be on a level vwith its first floor, and not with its groLmd floor, as they ought to be. The result will be that the edifice will look bmuied, and in foggy weather will certainly be wvrapped in a somewhat thicker veil of mist than the trees in Hyde Park. Viewed from Brompton, of course it will have the advantage of a slight rise-five feet or so ; but that -will not compensate for its very great depression as viewed from the more important quarter. If the faultiness of the site were a matter of necessity we might submit to it, just as we now submit to looking down upon most of our other public buildings. But it so happens that, if we must take our pictiures a mile and a half west of Hyde Parkcorner, there is a site with all the advantages of that at Kensington-gore, and none of the disadvantages we have mentioned. The site of Kensington Palace is unexceptionable. It is the highest point of Kensington-gardens, and only ten or twelve feet below the highest point of Hyde Park. It stands within easy distance of the Kensington and Bayswater roads. It is surrounded on three sides by a beautiful and well-timbered park; and on the fourth side is at least open, and without anything in the shape of a nuisance near it. It is, of course, the place where the QuEER'S palace ought to have been; but with the immense sums we have spent, and are still spending, on Buckingham Palace, that is no longer a question. The site is deserted for ever by Royalty. To what purpose the uncouth old pile is devoted, and who lives there, few people know without looking to the Coutrt Guzide, and few are the wiser when they have discovered the names of the half-dozen occupants. The building, however, so far as regards any national purpose, is as deserted as the palaces of Babylon; for even the prestige that huncg over it for a time from having been the residence of the Princess rICTOxtsA has. faded away. As for the building, they who have known it many years might be sorry to see it no more, and we certainly have few buildings of even that short and ambiguous antiquity. But the amount of sentiment to be rdspected by preserving the " palace" is infinitesimal, compared with the common sense of utilizing a very good site for a very important national purpose. We are quite sure that if our English Louvre is built in the hollow between Kensington-gore and Brompton, every impartial foreigner will remark with astonishment on the misplacement of the two buildings, and will wish that eaclh could be put on the site of the other. As for the old ladies and gentlemen now lodging in Kensington Palace, we have no doubt they would just as soon have good housys in Belgravia, a little more in the world, and within reach of their friends. The Royal Commissioners for the Great Exhibi- tion can do what they like with their domain at Kensington-gore. It is part of their scheme to dispose of a considerable portion; and, if necessary, they could sell the whole to advantage. There are, however, numerous purposes connected with the promotion of science and art to which the principal site on that property could still be applied. It would be a great pity, and, we will add, very illogical, that Government should consider itself precluded from a very good site for the new National Gallery because through the Royal Commissioners it has command of a very inferior one. The National Gallery is an affair of the nation at large, and need not be mixed up with the Great Exhibition. It is a nmatter on which public opinion ought to be consulted, and on which it is very inmportant to secure that opinion. Let Government propose to take what we may call without any exaggeration the magnificent site of Kensington Palace, and we are sure they wil obtain almost any sum of money, in reason, they choose to ask for. It wil be our Louvre, and we all Inow that a Louvre costs something. On the other hand, if Government adheres to the proposal of the Royal Commission, and asks money for a building in the low ground behind Kensington-gore, there wil be no enthusiasm for an edifice which can never be anything -but a disappointment. Indeed, if that site is persisted in, the architect himself will probably be the first to admit the failure by concealing the edifice as much as possible from the higher level of Kensington-road. At least, he will have to choose between two alternatives,-he will either bring the building near a noisy, dusty road, or obtain quiet by placing it far back, on the lower level, in vwhich case he nill rather hide it than allow the spectator to look down upon it. We need only ma7ke one more remark, which, as it seems to us, is singly concluisive. If a gallery or museum is in the heart of a city the people are there, and they have only to turn aside, or step a few yards, and they will find themselves among pictures and other works of art. But they will not go three or four miles to such a place, as one may see by the Dulwich GaJlery. The only condition on which a sub-urban gallery will be frequented is when the locality is frequented for other reasons, as a promenade, or a place to enjoy a little freslh air. Now, that is the character of Kensington-gardens, but not of the site in the hands of the Commissioners. The people are already in Kensington-gardens. It is a favoiuite resort. On any fine day you wiU find them there by hundreds, and sometimes by thousands. The people, then, being there already, will enter the Gallery; and they will go from town for the double purpose of a few hours' fresh air, a promenade among gay people, and a stroll in the GaUery. There wiU be no such concurrence of attractions at the other site. It must depend on pure zeal for art. Its only frequenters wiU be those who devote halfa-day to a journey to Kensington-gore to " do' the National Gallery, and, having done it, return to town. That class, we venture to predict, wiU not be very numerous.

The latest authentic intelligence received from the American seat of Government contains nothing to corroborate the report, which, we believe, originated in the hearsayassertion of a passenger bythe America. Of the probability of the dismissal of Mr. Crampton our reaers have quite as good grounds as ourselves for forming an estimate, but we think it right to state that we have every reason to disbelieve the announcement that so grave a circumstance has actually occurred.-Globr.
TIlE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA. (IoMM OUR OWN- CO]MESPONDENT.) BEEEI, JUNE 3. The Emperor of Russia left Potsdam shortly after midnight, and passed through here about 1 o'clock this morning, on his return to St. Petersburg. Ac. cording to the arrangements madce he was to breakfast in Schneidemibil this morning and dine to-day in6 Knigsberg. All ceremonial at any of the stations has been expressly declined, and thus this long journey, which to others would cause only fatigue, will be to him a source of invaluable rest and repose previously to his entering upon a fresh campaign of parades and receptions, &c., in his own territories. It is understood that from KEOnigsberg he will travel along the coast and visit the various Baltic ports. It will possibly be some time before any full and detailed information can be obtained of the more private occupations of the Emperor while at Potsdam, when withdrawn from the eyes of the public; but, as far as I have as yet heard, the little leisure that his public and exterior occupations left himwas necessarily devoted to business, which always kept him up till far into the night. Those who have had the opportunity of noticing his course of life there mention with admiration that he eagerly seized everyopportunity of leisure, however short,to payhis respects to the Empress Mother, and that if occupied entirely during the day he neverfailedto spend some time witlh her when the various members of the circle withdlew to their several apartments in the evening. The footing on which the present Eraperor stands with hismother, the Dowager Empress, is described to be of the most affectionate and cordial nature, in spite of the notorious difference of their views: the mother remains still as closely wedded to the ideas of the late Emperor as she was to himself in life; the son embracing the power thus early committed by IProvidence to his hands as a welcome opportunity of working, out another set of principles and views. It is related that when the youngEmperor waspreparing, on the day of his father's death, to receive the homage of the rest of his family and of the dignitaries of the State as Emperor, shortly before he would have to enter the marble saloon, where they were all assembled, his mother entered his room alone, to be the first to greet him as Emperor; she had left the bier of the husband she had loved so truly, had dried her tears, and clothed herself with all the insignia of Imperial Majesty, her -hite satin robe of State, &c., and set her crown on her head, to do full and official honoui to her son on his accession to the throne. It may be interesting to mention some of the circumstances attending the presentation, 27 years ago, of the 3d Regiment of Lancers to the Grand Duke Alexander, then a lad of 11 years of age. Orders were sent a fewc days before the ceremony to the Colonel commanding the regiment, whose head-quarters -were then, as now, at Firstenwalde, to march to Berlin, so as to have his men in full parade trim on the aercier platz, by the Brandenburger Thor, on June 12, 1829, but without the object of his march being allowed to transpire. When the regiment was drawn up at the appointed time and place, the late King rode up with the Emperor Nicholas and his eldest son, and, on the coloners presenting his muster-roll, informed him of his intention to present the regiment to the young Grand Duke; on which the latter vtwas received by the men with three cheers on presenting himself to them; he then put the reg,iment through its evolutions, and eventually led it in full march, in front of his parents, his uncles and aunts, and his grandfather. When the ceremony was over the youthful ckof of the regiment, accompanied by his uncle William, now Prince of Prussia, marched at its head, in at the Brandenburger Thor, and down to the palace, where its colours were deposited in the apartments of the Grand Dukse, and a guard of honour posted at the entrance. On every occasion of his visiting Prussia the Emperor has not failed to devote considerable time to his regiment, and to take a lively interest in its welfare; his father presented it -with many valuable horses, and he himself bestowed on it trumpets, horns, and other wind instruments inU silver. The presence of the regiment on the parade on Saturday was a surprise, and a delicate attention on the part of the Aing, who had only a few days before ordered that the name of the regiment should be changed from " Grossfurst Thronfolger von Russland, Alexauder Nicolajewitch Kaiserliche Hoheit" to "K aiser von Russland," with the Imperial cipher on the field of the epaulettes. I mentioned yesterday the Emperor's habit of drawing back from the tiresome, fatiguing honours thrust upon him wherever he goes This was evidenced very plainly at the Opera on Saturday night. The Royal state box, -which here occupies the entire centre of the premier tier;, was brilliantly lit up, and sprinkl;ed with Court dignitaries in stars anid orders and dashing uniforms, so that all eyes were kept turned in that direction, even for some time after the Emperor, accompanied by the King, had entered and taken their seats in a private proscenium box. As soon as he was noticed, however, the whole audience (which, by the way, was almost exclusively military) rose from their seats and gave him three rounds of cheering. The Emperor, evidently very much surprised at the warmth of the greeting, rose from his seat and turned towards the King, as if attributing this welcome to him, and appealing for information. The King, however, gave a deprecatory wave of the hand, which impEed that not he, butlhis guest was the subject of this ovation, on which the Emperor bowed to the audience several times in acknowledgment. W"hile the national anthem was being played by the orchest a, the Emperor remained standing at the King's side ; and at the end of it the audience volunteeredhim three rotmds more. The performance on the occasion was M11eyerbeer's opera of Das Feldlager in Sc&desiem, the music of -which has been set to another libretto, under the name of L'Btoie d(a Nord. After the exercising of his regiment yesterday at tlle Ereuzberg, -which also is but a repetition of what has taken place on every occasion of the Grand Duke Alexander's coming here, the Emperor proceeded, accompanied by all the Princes present, to see the shooting practice of the K-aiser Alexander Regiment with the needle-gun. As a proof of the rapidity with which this arm can be fired these troops delivered five volleys in one minute and a half. Theresult as regards ai vwas also considered very good, the majority of the shots having hit the target, -which is the figure of a man, and the distance being l50paces (a pace is equal to 2ft. 2in. English). At a distance of 300 paces a detachment of the Garde Alexander Regiment practised with roc7kets, &c., -with a Caisson for their target, in the course of which one in every three discharges exploded the charge of powder contained in it ; at a distance of 400 paces only one discharge in nine was successful. Now that the Emperor is gone, all the notabilities are taking their departure as fast as possible. Prince Woronzoff and Count Nesselrode left yesterday; Prince Gortschakoff will leave this evening for St. Petersburg direct; the Grand Duke and Duchess of MIeckldenburg-Schwerin have left for I Iei; and the Grand Duke of Weimar for Weimar. Prince Windischbgritz left here this morning for ienna; the Granld Duke of Oldenburg, wTho left yesterday evening, had presented him yesterday with the insignia of th e Order of his House. The Emperor of iRussia has bestowed the Order of St. Andrew on B3aron von Manteufel. The Duchess of Sagan has just arrived, and the Queen of Bavaria will remain here till next Thursday. General Sir 'William. Williams, with his secretary, Mr. Churchhill, and his adjutant, Captain Teesdale, has left this for London. The Emperor has pardoned Bakunin, who, as it wlll be recoLected, was taken with arms in his hands by the Prussian soldiery wlien putting do-wn the insurrection in Dresden in 1848, and was subsequently delivered up to the Russian authorities as a Russian subject. He had previously made himself celebrated by a variety of pamphlets written against Ruissia, and published in Fxrance, and in 1848 was active as a revolutionary agent in different parts of Germany. It is understood that he isindebted for hispardon to the interest made with the Empress Mother by General lonravieff, who is a cousin of Bakunin. I must correct a mistak-e I made a day orttwo back withrespect to the General Mouravieff who was here in the suite of the Emperor. He is not the captor of Kars, but aLieitenant-General of that name. The health of the Empress Mother is described as improving rapidly. The result of a consultation of physicians held at Potsdam has been that her state of health is by no means of a nature to inspire any anxiety on her account. The appointment of Baron Budberg to the Vienna post and that of Baron Brunow to the mission here, which I have already reported to you as settled, has, however, been only just now definitively fixed here. People are to be found here sufficiently malicious to say that this removal of Baron Budberg from here. to Vlienna is part of the Russian demonstration against Austria and in favour of Prussia. The ap pointment of Prince Dolgorouki to the embassy in Paris may also be looked on now as definitively settled.
MUSIC IN KBNSIKVGTON-GABDENS. We publish the official copy of the correspondence just laid before Parliament between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the First Lord of the Treasury, on the suppression of music in Kensington-gardens on Sundays:- (No. 1. FROM TmE ARCHaBISHOF OF CANTERBURY TO LOrlD PALrXSTON. "Laimbeth, May 10. "My Lord,-Your Lordship must permit me to address you on a subject on which I ought perhaps to have communicated with you sooner, but on which I can no longer be silent, either on my own account or on that of many of my episcopal brethren, who are appeled to -very earnestly respecting the Sunday music in the park. " It is with much reluctance that I interfere in a matter which has the sanction of Her Yajesty's Government, and in which a large class of persons is interested whom we isiould be most unwilling to deprive of any hRrmless gratification. But the letters and petitions which reaclh me daily, and call for an expression of my opinion either in Parliament or elsewhere, malke it impossible for me to conceal from your Lordship the feelings 'with which these performances are regarded, and the offence which they occasion to a large andinfluential portion of Her Mdajesty's subjects. These consider the qucstion, as to their continuance or discontinuance, a vital question as concerns the national religion. " Concurring as I do in these sentiments, I feel it a duty which I owe to my station to represent them to your Lordship. "Ihave, &c. " J. B. CANTUAI." (No. 2.) FROM LORD rA MESTON TO THxE ARClInIS3Or OF CANRrnDUY. " Broadlands, :lay 10. "My dear Lord,-I received your letter of to-day just as I was leaving London for this place. I concurred in the arrangements for performances by military bands in Kensington-gardens and in the parks for a couple of hours on Sunday afternoon, after Divine service, because I thought that those arraangements would afford the inhabitants of the metropolis innocent intellectual recreation combined with fresh air and healthy exercise, and such recreation did not seem to me to be at variance with the soundest and purest sentiments of religion. Such was my opinion, and such is my opinion still; for I have heard nothing on the part of those who object to these arrangements which has altered my 'view of the matter. " But I find from your Lordship's leter, and from representations which have reached me from other quarters, that a great number of persons whose opinions are entitled to respect look upon the matter from a different point of view, and entertain in regard to it strong opinions widely different from my own. " In this state of things I am naturally led to aslcmymelf, vhetherthe advantage to be gained by a continuance of these musical performances is sufficiently great to compensate for the evil of running counter to the religious feelings of a large body of the community; and to that question there can be but one answer-namely, that it is not. I shall tnerefore, in deference to the sentiments expressed by your Grace, on your own part, and on that of others, tal;e steps for discontinuing the band plaving in Kensingtongardens andin the parks on Sundays. "fy dear Lord, yours, &c., " PALMERSTON." The correspondence was only ordered to be printed on Wednesday.
LOCAL iHARGES UPON SHIPPING. The Committee met yesterday in room lZo. 18, Mr. Lowe in the chair. On the motion of Mr. HORSFALL the room Vas cleared, and, on the public being re-admitted, the Caummsix called- Mr. IL W. Schneider, member of a firm of iron merchants, who said he had to complain of the town dues of Liverpool on several grounds, and chiefly because in the exportation of iron ore fromn South Wales to the Staffordshire district the vessels did not approach the tou7n of Liverpool, and yet a charge of 3d. a-ton was made upon the cargoes shipped at Birkenhead, Runcorn, or Garston. In consequence of this charge other routes had to be taken, and there was no doubt a considerable traffic had been diverted from the Mersey in consequence of these dues. On the iron ore the dues amounted to as much as 16G, per cent. upon the value ofthe freight. 'Ihe dues levied on coals were extrecmely oppressive. Witness emploved steamers of his own for the supply of the Cunard steamers, and these did not approach the shore or enter the port of Liverpool, but a change of 2d. a-ton was made on all coals -which entered the Mlersey for the supply of the Cunard and other steamers. This charge amounted to something like ol. a-cargo, and at the rate at which w itness was nowv carrying coals it wonldbe about301. a-month,-a veryconsiderable sum upon the profits of the steamers. Witness also objected to the tax as, comparatively, nothing was expendedontheconservancy of the Mersey out of the 140,0001. received from town dues by the corporation of Liverpool. Mr. Edgar Bowring, Registrar of the Board of Trade, said that nL 1826 this country concluded atreatof commercial reciprocity with France, and some years subsequently (in 2832,) complaints w ere made that the sirsit of the treatywvas violatedby British subjects, as it w as found in the Channel Islands and elsev;here local exemptions were enjoyed by freemen of the ports which virtually constituted differential dues in their favour. The question was inquired into, and the British Government informed the Erench that they could not entertain the objection, as itwasfoundthatBntish subjects were upon the same footing in respect to the exemptions of the freemen as foreigners. The question rested here until 1849, wvhen the navigation lawvs were repealed, and a general treaty was concluded with France and other countries. The French tUovernment handed in a list of 165 ports (out of a total of 500 or 600) in which it was alleged thatlocal exemption existed. It was felt thatif such exemptions existed the spirit of the treaty would be evaded, and thesubject was thoroughly investigated. The result was to prove thatithe complaint had been much exaggerated and that in only S1 ports did local exemptions exist. By r. WAOnSFL-The original complaint of theFrencrGovernmentmixed up the question of the exemption of freemen and the differential dues, and, as far as the latter were concerned, oh r e an a rance was given thatthe treaty should not be infringed. By ler. i AISO.-The complaint in the case of Liverpool was the of n th o oThe freemen from the town dues. It was pointed out to the French Government that there was a sunaicipal act wvhich provided for the gradual extinctionof this privilege, andin proof of this it *vas showin that wrhile in 18o0 the number of freemen in Liverpool w as 6,000, it hadfallen off to 3,0S0. Witness hero read a despatch fromthe French Government dated the 25th of September, 1852, in reply to the above representation, objecting to any delay in the arrangement of the question. It had been the occasion of much irritation, and operated very injuriously to interests of British ships in foreign Ports. By Mr. CAr.DnxzLL.-Thc remlt has been that the British Government have refused to acknowledge the justice of the objection, and the French Government have declined to depart from the ground they had taken. Mr. Park, of Wigan, coalowner, was next examined, and in answer to the Chairman said the chief manufacture in 'Vigan was cotton, and the quantity manufactlured annually was 120,000 hales, upon -which the dues for imports were S601. per annum, and, taking the ex-ports at half that moimt, it would give a sum of 1,oO0I. per annum on cotton goods alone. The coals raised from the Lancashire and Cheshire fields amounted to 3,000,000 tons annually, and thetown dues were one-third of the royalty. WNtitncss then proceEded to give same evidence to the committee as to the right of the corporation to levy the dues in question. After detailing the several grants, &c., MEr. Park read the particulars of a tilal in the Court of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1555, betheen Sir Richard Molyneux and the corporation of Liverpool, in order to show that at that date the freemen of Liverpool had no clear or recognized exemption - from the payment of thc dues. The lease from the Molyneux family to the corporation was dated 1672. Looling at theact of William and Mary, which recited an act of Henry VIII., it was evident that the right to the dues was confined to the waters of the lMfersey within the lord. .hip of Liverpool, which, in witness's opinion, would -e the low water mark immddiately opposite LiverpooL The only remedy for the evils complained of would be by Parliamentary interference to abolish the dues, except so far as they were necessary for the support of the port of Liverpool. Se did not see what parties could claim compensation. By Mr. CARDWELL.-He was aware that Parliament had taken away from the Trinity-house of London the right to charge for lights to a larger amount than was required for the maintenance of the lights, &c., and this without giving any compensation. By r. HOBSFALL.-The corporation of Wigan did not possess any property, and the taxes amounted to Ss. 6d. in the pound. The CnAThaaLN then announced that he had no other -witnesses; whereupon iIr. HonsFALL said he did not propose to call any evi-- denee until the next meeting, as much new matter had' arisen, which it would be necessary to consider. - The committee then adjourned until Monday next, at 12o'clock.

THHE BRITISH ARMY. rThe folUoring appeaxod in our second ediion of yes. hOidA1 --I LTaO3 OI SPECIAL CO REMN.D NT.) VAti BEFORE SEBASTOPOL, MA&Y 21. The monotony of life in a camp like this is as complete aud, as barren of incident as existence in a barrack at home. Visits to Mackenzie, to the north forts, to the coast, lose all their charm in being deprived of their novelty. An accident which has occurred to the son of a dear friend of mine out here would, however, under any circumstances, prevent my being able to send a long letter, even if there were material for it, and the greater part of the few lines I now forward were w-ritten in anticipation of the post. The mails, which have been delivered with considerable regularity for some time past, bring us no news for discussion, and the question of the north of Sebastopol, the Black Sea forts, -and Nicholnieff has been exhausted long ago. It was ludicrous enough to read the dissertations -Ol the g,reatcanvass question at home. Our permanent transports, wlhich remained as. storeships in Balakdava, could have furnished abundant material for covering horses, and as to the fituess of the -canvass for such a purpose, I need only remark that several canvass stables can now be seen by I anybody in our cavalry camp, and that the French used canvass to protect their horses al last winter in the valley of Baidar. It was good enough for the men of the army, at all events, in the winter of 185i-5. As to the peace, it is " accepted" by the army without enthusiasm, joy, or satisfaction. They are afraid, indeed, of a cool reception at home, but I amr certain that the country knows and appreciates too well their devotion, their sufferings, and their services for that apprehension to be realized. Clinker was a tinker's dog, and led a sorry life of it till his master wanted him to fight. lIe thentook him between his legs, patted him, called him " Good dog," and fed him for the battle, but when the fighting was over poor Clinker had a miserable life of it again, and received nothing but kicks, blows, and reduced diet. However, he managed to rub on for some time, till hewas horrified by another unusually tender demonstration on the part of his master, whereupon he bolted, and "qeft the service," for he knew that something desperate was anticipated in the fighting line, or he never would be so fondled and fed. The moral of the fAble is obvious. Lieutenant-Colonel James, R.E., LieutenantColonel Stanton, R.E., and Captain Gordon, R.E., have started for Bessarabia to survey the line of the new boundary between Russia and Moldavia, and to aid the commission with their professional advice and experience. Captain Hammaersley, DeputyAssistant- Quartermaster-General, Head-Quarters Staff, and Captain Brook, Assistant-QuartermasterGeneral, Fourth Division, two active and intelligent officers, have been selected to proceed to Perekop, and to examine the roads, the bridges across the Sivash at Tchongar and elsewhere, and the country around Genitchi, Arabat, and Kaffa, in order, I suppose, to satisfy the authorities that if they had made a forward movement they would have succeeded in forcing the Russians to fight a pitched battle or to retreat. The staff officers of the Russian armly are busily engaged in surveying our camp, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Enag. lish army has ordered that every facility shall be afforded them. They have closely exanmined the construction of the railway, and have studied the plans and sections deposited in MIr. Campbell's offhce at Balaklava. The questions they asked respecting rails, sleepers, &c., indicated a limited acquaintance with the elements of railway engineering. Dr. Mouatt and another medical officer have returned from a tour in the Crimea, d&ring which they have minutely inspected the Russiani military hospitals, with a view to prepare a report upon their medical system. That the Russians will profit by what they see no one who witnesses their avidit-y for information and desire of improvement can possibly doubt. They are deeply parsuaded of the necessity which exists for making good roads; but I fear they look upon that necessity as one arising rather out of military and pDlitical than peaceful and commercial considerations. "None of us ever dreamed of the Crimea being made the scene of a great campaign, or we should have had good roads, and possibly a railroad, to Sebastopol." That is their constant remark-. The strangest, buLt the most universally asserted and best attested, fact we have learned from our late enemies is this-that, had the fire continued, they would have blown up their workfs and evacuated the south side cf the towni on the 10th, or at furthest on the ]2th of September-that is, either two or four days after the assault. The fire was too tremendous and all-searching to be withstood. The officer of one regiment, which garrisoned the Malaldhoff from thc evening of the 6th till the evening of the 7th, said they marched in 3,400 men, with 70 officers, and when they -were relieved 2,800 men and 51 officers had been killed or 'wounded by shell and shot. Sometimes a shell rolled down into a bombproof and blew up among tlle dense mass of men inside. Sometimes a roiund shot, striking one of the sneasive beams of wood which supported the works, sent a shower of deadly splinters all rounid it, aud the service of the guns was attended with the certainty that almost every gunner would be hit by the French riflemen in the course of the day. The Russians concur in saying that they lost more than 2,000 men every day of the fire. But then, if they had waited till the 10th, and no assault had been made, what would have occurred? The fire must have slackened on the 9th, for the allies had not the means of continuing it. 'The Russians, most` likely, more sl!o, would have plucked up heart of grace, set to work, and been ready for another bombardment, which could not possibly have taken place for two months. But then winiter woould have been upon us, and-however, there is no use in supposing. The French have up to this date embarked and despatched from the Crimea 55,600 men. They are -wise in their generation. It is assutredly desirable to get out of these portions of the Czar's dominions, or at all events off this plateau, before the heats of June set in. In order to accommodate the large garrison which wil choke the highways and byways of Malta for some time to come, the store huts not required here for military purposes will be forwarded to Valetta without delay, and General Windham has been actively engaged in making the necessary arrangementes. The cover afforded to the men from the sun of that broiled island, where the dog-days last half the year, will be very grateful to men who would otherwise have had to undergo baking and roasting under canvass. Some of these huts will be worthless and unfit for removal. Another proceeding, which does not smack quite so much of wisdom Q. the part of the authorities, and which has ind,eed a home look about it worthy of the Naval iReview, is] the removal of the huts of the Army Works Corps from the front to Balak-lava. As this corps is not provided with transport, the navvies will have to carry the huts piecemeal. It has been calculated that the carriage of each hut from Balakl&Ta to the front by the Army Works Corps cost not less than 2001. sterling. Of course the cost of removal ill be the same, so that each edifice at Balaklava will stand the country in 4001. for locomotion-"trwo removals equal to one fire." Would it not have been cheaper to try the one fire, and xet these expensive and very well ventilate wooden palaces in flames? WVe are deterwined not to let the property of the Russians be birnt by our soldiers. It is impossible to say Whether there was a secret article or a secret understanding to the effect that the allies are to leave their standing camps to the Russiaus, but it is certain that the Sardinian semi-subterranean huts at Kauara and on the Fedukhine heights have been occupied by the late enemy's pickets, and that the laigblanders have been forbidden by general order to supply themselves from such tempting stores of fuel; nor is it permitted to burn or aid in burning the huts abandoned by the French. The deserted cantonmnents have the most desolate aspect imaginable. Those cities of huts are abandoned to the rats, which squeak horribly in anticipation of their approaching death by hunger. The empty windowframes blink at you blindly without glasses in their eyes, and the inhospitable doorways are ever open, for the doors have been removed, and within you can see only rained hearths and empty meat tins. The amount of brushwood, wattles, and young timber used in their erection was enormous, and if they were as healthy as they are comfortable inside it is questionable whether they would not be much preferable to our wooden huts. The plastered clay on the walls and roofs of interleaved wattles is quite fresh and waterproof; but Baron Larrey has warned us that this mode of cantonment, borrowed from the Turks, and imitated from the Tartars by our almes, is liable to produce unhealthy action among the troops adopting it. Baidar, Varnutka, Misk-omnia, all those charming valleys and those delicions cool shady ravines, are as verdant to-dayas if the woodman had spared every tree, and bough, and shrtub that could find room to grow there; but they, too, are desolate. In Baidar there is only one inhabitant, a poor lunatic Tartar, who chatters and gibbers from one of the few houses in the village at the passing stranger. It has come to our Generars ears that the Cossacks are preventing the Tartars coming in, and he has addressed representations on the subject to the Russian authorities, which will, no doubt, secure them free transit. It is understood that the Rissians have considerably mitigated the rigour of their quarantine laws for the present. MONDAY. A Black Sea fog set in, and al day the camp was shrouded in a cloud of mist and vapour. The Himalaya has arrived in Balaklava, and is expected to take two regiments away. The artillery are embarking stores and men as fast as they can in the Queen of the South. To-day the Sardinian HeadQu.arters Staff, General della Marmora and his officers, will sail in a Sardinian man-of-war for Italy. Should the present weather last, however, it is not likely the vessel will put to sea. General Codrington has written a flattering after-order on the occasion of the Sardinian Comnmander-in-Chief's departure, and has ordered a guard of honour to be in readiness to attend him on embarking. There will be a few Sardinians left to take charge of stores and huts. The Britannia has not yet sailed wsith the remainder of the 4Gth Regiment, and the men have not embarked,possiblybecause of the unfavourable weather. TuESDeVy. The fog continued aU through the night, and is still drifting over the camp, but there are indications that it will blow over in the course of the day. General Codrington, General Barnard, and a few officers are about to start on a short tour round the south coast to-day or to-morrow. Notwithstanding .lhe changes in the temperature the troops continue very healthy. The Ottawa, sick transport, has been [ying here for some time past, waiting, in vain for a =argo to Scutari. Active measures are being taken :o enclose the Russian graveyards and cemeteries, which have been to some degree devastated by what ,he General-in-Chief cals "the necessities of war." A. general order has been issued on the subject, and the tombstones will be set uip and the waUs repaired iorthw ith. They are looking busily for the churchyard at Kamara, but it cannot be found. It was discovered in the winter of 1854-5 that gravestones make good hearths for fireplaces, and the Turks and others encamped in the neighbourhood did not fail to apply this discovery in a practical manner. The French Army of Reserve is still encamped on the plateau of the Monastery, but the troops near Kamiesch are slowly drifting away. The Sardinians hiave purchased many of the Highland officers' chargers at fair prices, and the " horse grievance" excitement is dying off; but a very slight thing will suffice to revive it.
TURKEY. (FRO-m OUR OWN CORRESPOiNDF-.S.) CONSTANMTINOPLE, MLtv 22. The infantry of the Contingent is beginning to arrive. The first detachment, consisting of a few companies of the 5th Regiment, formerly the 0th of the corps d'arrnec of Constantinople, came in last week; the day before yesterday the rest of the regiment has arrived. It will be soon followed by the others, as a good number of transports have been sent up to Kertch to clear the place of its garrison and stores. I have seen the newly-arrived regiment on its way to the camp of Ok-meidan. Having Imnown it before it was given over to the Contingent, it was rather interesting to recall my recollections, and compare them with their present appearance. The comparison, at any rate as far as one could judge by appearance, was entirely in favour of the present, and, if they are as much improved in their drill and discipline as in their general appearance, the Turks can certainly not complain of the Contingent. I am only afraid that thev are determined to find fault with it in spite of everything, and to obliterate all traces of the Contingent by disbanding imnuediately after they get them back the regiments iwhich formed it. If the Contingent is not kept up as a body as a nucleus for a new reformed army, it is, perhaps, the best thing they can do, for singly the regiments after their return to their respective corps Vaimre are too few to exert any iniluence on the spirit of the rest, while the new ideas which they have acquired would become only an element of disorder in the army. Besides this, all the regiments which have been given to form the Contingent are either Rediffs, who are only called out in times of war, or old regiments who have long ago completed their period of five years, after which they have a right to retire. As the Turks are not inclined to take advantage of the Contingent for reforming their army, they will have to adopt other measures for the purpose if they w ish to have an army at all. They have first literally to re-form their army, for if the Rediffs are discharged, together with the reg-iments of the Contingent and all those troops who have served their time, very little will remain to reform it. In the last war no military organization appeared in a very brilliant light; but none perhaps made a more wretched display than the Ottoman army. If we compare the goodly array which was collected on the Danube, and, following its fate down to the present day, if we look at the ruins remaining of it, we cannot but come to the conclusion that the military system of Turkey is a complete failure, which may keep up appearances for a time, but which has no inherent vitality to carry it through a great war; and yet the warlike spirit of the Miahomedan population cannot oe said to have degenerated, for wherever it had a fair chance it redeemed its old fame. The melancholy helplessness of the Turkish military system becomes even more evident when we recollect what favourable chances it had in the beginning. Nearly the whole army was collected under one commander, with almost unlimited power, and the resources of several rich provinces at his disposal, and a successful campaign for a whole year. What better chances could any arny have to improve and perfect its organization? And two years after we see "the elite"' of this army in ingrelia posses,sing not an officer who can be trusted wiith thethrowing up of a temporary battery already traced. Nobody will be surprised at this who has been for any time with the Turkish. army. To eradicate favouritisra and nepotism from an army altogether is of course impossible; but there is a great difference between favouritism forniipg an excptiot oir only part of the system, and where, as in the Turkish army, the whole system of promotion is based upon it. In other armies you have the principle of seniority combined with a narrower or wider margin for rewarding distinguished services or more than ordinary capacities. In the Turkish army the principle of seniority is altogether set aside, and merit in a man who has not at the same time a powerful protector to back him is rather a drawback than otKerwise. The evil effects of this system show themselves from the beginning. When a youth enters the Military Schools one of the first experiences which he makes is that any pains he may take and any accomplishments he may acquire will go for nothing; he must gain somebody's good graces somehow or other. How can one expect 'with these ideas early incuIcated that he should take any trouble to acquire a knowledge which will not help him in future P His whole endeavours are directed to find somebody who will take him as his aide-dc-camp, or otherwise on his Staff, for this is the road to advancement. There is scarcely an aide-de-camp who has not come out of the war with two or three steps, whereas there are regimental officers who have become gray in the service and who have been captains and majors for 20 and more years. In the beginning of the war every one of the latter hoped that the force of eircumstances would lead to an alteration, and that their services would no more be ignored. They now see. their mistake, and are disgusted with the service. Alen may have different ideas about the strategic capacities of Omar Pasha, hut no one can absolve him from the charge of not having done anything to break this system, which, with the power he possessed, could have been easily done. Asit is, the army has not two coloneld who can put their regimeat thlrough the simplest manceuvres, and not one General of Division who can handle a brigade properly; and the men know this, and have no confidence in the judgment of their officers at a oritical moment. Another want which is likewise feIt in the organization of the army is that of a permanent system of non-commissioned oflicers. The Turkish Government has not been able to make military service very attractive, and the first thought of a recruit on joining his regiment is when he will be able to leave it. In consequence of this no one wants to be made a non-commissioned oflicer, as it would expose him *to the chance of remaining beyond his five years, and the greatest difficulties prevail in completing the necessary number. Even those who have been induced to become corporals and sergeants are sure to go when they have completed their term, if they can get leave. An extension and re-organization of the military schools would easily supply this deficiency. In old Turkey the sword ruled, in new Turkey the pen; only, as in everything else, this also has been carried to an extreme. There is one single school for military education, and there are 12 in Constantinople for kiatibs, or scribblers. The civil service has such allurements that everybody wants to become an official himself, or, at any rate, make one of his son. The Government by establishing so many schools for the men of the pen, favoured this pernicious tendency, which creates a useless class far more numerous than the offices require, w hile an ill-placed econonystints military education. Besides the smaUer elementary military schools attached to each coGps d'arm&le, there is one higher military schlool at Constantinople, which is supposed to supply the army wvith officers. Every year 100 are adnitted, and they have to remain six or seven years, two of which are preparatory. The money would certainly not be thrown away if one was to take several hundreds to the preparatory schools, and advance to the higher classes only those who show capacities; the rest might, after the preparatory two years, be sent as non-commissioned officers to the army. Having chosen the military profession, and being educated for it, they mighlt by degrees form a permanent cadre of non-commissioned officers; while, on the other hand, Hf due regard was paid to the numbers wanted in the army, room might always be left for the advancement of those privates who exerted themselves to obtain such situations. These non-commissioned officers would likewise prove in many cases fit for subaltern officers and captains. But this, as well as any other improvements, will turn out futile unless the chief error in the system, the shameless favomuitism, be abolished, and another principle of advancement introduced into the army. It banishes all zeal, aU energy, and all pride of profession. You kinow from my last letter that the chiefs of the different religious communities have been called to the Porte to carry the article of the HattiHiumayoun into execution whiclh promises that the chiefs and one delegate of each community shall be appointed by the Porte for one year, in order to attend the deliberations of the State Coincil in affairs regarding general interests. The choice has beenmade. Besides the patriarchs, as chiefs of the religious communities, there is Prince Vogorides, formerly Prince of Samos, as delegate for the Greeks; M. Mlihram-Duz, the Director of the Mint, for the Catholic-Armenians Mr. Boghos Dadian for the Armenian, and M. Hatom for the Jewish communities. The 46th Regiment passed through here, on its way to Corfu, on board the Britannia. The 1st Royal Dragoons embarkedon Sundaylast on board the Orinoco.
THE. Ai.VCHESTEB .ECGHANICS' INSTITUTIOJ. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIfIES. Sir,-In your journal of MIonday, the 2d inst., I find a paragraph headed " The MIanchester School of Art," which is likely, without comment, to lead to somre misapprehension on the part of the public. The institution to. whichl the -paragraph refers is not the "MIanchester School of Art," hut the Manchester Mechanics' Institution; and I an sure I bare only to point out the error and I shal find it corrected in the next issue of your journal. I feel the importance of this correction, inasmuch as the Manchester Mechanics' Institution is among the oldest in the kingdom, and the directors are now about to enter upon a labour the greatest of its kindeverundertaken in connexion with such an institution. Twenty-nine years ago the present building in Cooper-street was erected, then the first devoted to the special purpose of a mechanics' inistitution. Ample as at that time the accommodation was thought to be, the wants of the mechanics have ou.tgrown the boundar of the original walls, and in a few days the dirgftors will take possession of a new building, the cost of which will exceed 21,000l. To have accomplished aU this, and to propose to inaugurate the new building with an exhibition illustrative of art and art manufacture upon the gigantic scale now under contemplation, is to give evidence of a vitality in adult education that may perhaps interest your readers in distant parts of the kingdom, and will help to show also that mechanics' institutions are not " complete failures." Very rcapectfully do l ask the favour of your insertion of the above, by way of correcting the error to wvhich I call your attention, and beer to subscribe myself A MANCHEISTER MAN.

PRINTERS' AvmSHOUSES, WOOD-GREEN, MIDDLESEX.-The first election of inmates to this institution took place on Wednesday evening at Anderton's Hlotal, Fleetstreet, when, after a spirited ballot, one woman and two men were elected, after which the annual meeting was held, and the usual officers elected for the ensuing year, lr. V. Figgins, one of tho trustees, occupying the chair. The successful candidates will be formally inducted into their new abode and the institution publicly opened on Wednesday next, June 11, when a publmc breakfast will b&' held in the grounds under the presidency of Earl Stanho;ce, who vnill be supported hy tho chief master printers and publishers of London, who have consented to act as stewards on the occasion. POISONnrG IN SomERSErSssmE.-An inquisition was held on Tuesday at Wellington, a town in the above county, to inquire into the cause of death of Anne Hill a woman aged 03. The deceased was in the service of Mr. Buncombe, surgeon. On Saturday Mr. Buncomnbe called in the aid of a photographer to take likenesses of his family, and on leaving the artist incautiously left behind him a bottle containing cyanide of potassium, a most deadly poison, used in completing the pictures taken photoaraphically. The deceased, having occasion to go into the room, sawv the bottle, and, believing the contents to be gin, drank a portion, which terminated her existence in 20 minuteh, notwithstanding the stomach pump 'was hr ought into requisition 'within five minutes after the deceased had drunk the poison. IAi two minutes after committing the fatal act she became unconscious, the whole ofthe body was slightly convulsed oecasionally, and the upils of the eyes dilated. Sbe foamed at the mouth, the pulse was small and feeble, and there was spasmodic elosure of the jaws, which would have rendered the application of the stomach-DUmp useless had she not been toothless. The bottle originally contained six otmcoe of water, into which 20 grains of cyanide of potassium hal been introduced, and from the quantity left the surgeon examined at the inquest (Mr. Buncombe) inferred that the deceased sralowed an onnce and a-half of the solution, which must have contained five grains of cyanide of potassium. According to an authority, Orfila, six grains adniniis. tered in an injection caused death within an hour, therefora half that quantity taken into the stomach would produce the like effect. lrom Professor Taylor's hfanuol of mediC4? Ju,usprmtdence we learn that a case occurred at Breslau, in which a man, aged 30, died in a quarter of an hour after taking a dose of a mixture containing 15 grains of cyanide of potassium, which had been prescribed for him by his medical Attendant, under All the symptoms of poisoning by pruasic acid. The jury at Wellington found a 'verdict of " Accidental death," and pnwed a 'vote of censure on tho photographer.
FRANCE. (E0E OUR OWN CORa.SrONDrhDT.) EIfrlS, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 4, 6 r.K The gradual fall of the Rhone, which was announced yesterday, still continues, and the river has nearly returned to its bed. At Lyons, in order to facilitate the running off of the water from the in- undated parts, trenches have been cut in different places. The Grande Rue of the Guillotiere is still under water, and the communication can only.be carried on by boats. No exact idea can yet be formed of the extent of the damage done, but the number of houses that have been destroyed is now estimated at not less than 400, and several have fallen since the last calculation; the number of persons deprived of homes is said to be 25,000; as to the dead, no calculation can yet be made. The Lyons journals are filled with different incidents connected with the casualties and hairbreadth escapes of several of the inhabitants of the inundated quarters. A boat containing six soldiers capsized in the Plaine du Grand Camp, and three of the men were unfortunately drowned. A man residing at La Part Dieu, whose house fell down and buried his young wife, to whom he had been but recently married, threw himself in. despair into the Rthone. A woman lining on the Quai d'Albret, who saw her husband drowned while rendering assistance to some sufflerers, threw herself out of a window on the fourth story, and was killed on the spot. A young woman, who had been confined two days before, was taken out of her bed with her child and conveyed in a boat to a place of safety. A woman, holding a young child in her arms, was seen on the roof of a house crying for assistance, and a boat was speedily directed towards the spot. The boat had just arrived as the house began to give way; the mother threw her child into the arms of one of the boatmen, and in a moment after sank herself with the ruins. Three children were found buried beneath the ruins of one house after the waters had retired. It is impossible to describe in sufficient telrms of admiration the zeal which has been displayed by the authorities .and by the inhabitants in rendering assistance. hundreds of persons are seen carrying provisions of every kind to the churches, which have been thrown open for the reception of the houseless sufferers. In addition to the subscriptions in money which have been opened, a committee has been formed, which intends to send carts round and collect old clothes and small articles of furniture, of which the poor familes stand in need. The Cardinal Archbishop of Lyons, from the first commencement of the inundation, placed his palace at the disposal of the sufferers. The fears which had been entertained for the fate of Al. Roustan, the Mayor of Villeurbaine, and M. Villars, the commissaly of police, are happily unfounded. Those gentlemen have returned to their homes, after having been for some time confined hi a place by the water, from which M. Villars at length saved himself by sw imming, and then had a boat sent off to the assistance of his companion in misfortune. The railway has been broken through by the floods on several points between Tarascon and Graveson, and all communication beyond Tarascon on the left bank is interrupted. Atter the breaking down of the dike of Boulbon the water rapidly advanced to Arles across the plain which separates that town from Tarascon. The bridge of Trinquetaille -was carried away, and the communication with the f aubourg of that name cut offi From the top of the Tower of Arles the country round has the appearance of a vast lake; the Camargue is completely under water. At the viaduct on the Rhone between Tarascon and Beaucaire the water has reached the platform of the bridge, but the structure still holds firm. As to the suspension-bridge which unites Tarascon and Beaucaire, it is coinpletely covered. On the side of Beaucaire the PRhone has overflowed its banks, and inundated the plain towards Nismes. The railvay has not been injured, and the passage of the trains has been 3ept up between Marseilles and the right bank of the Rhone. We have received the journals of Toiilouse, Agen, Nantes, and Augers, which were due yesterday (Tuesday) morning: they had to be sent by a circuitoUs route owing to the floods. At Nantes, on Mfonday morning, the rise of the waters was not very considerable. At Anigers it was more important. At Touilouse the Garonne was falling on Saturday; at Agen, on Sunday morning, after a rise to 8 metres 30 centimetres, Iwhich inundated the lowver part of the city, the Garonne was stationary, -with a tendency to fall. The Lot and the Tarn had also risen considerably. The Aveyron was stationary. All the districts near these rivers have suffered immensely. The overflow of the Garonne was the third that has taken place this year. The accounts from Valence recordl "reat disasters. The bridges of Douzere and Rociemaure have been carried awav; biut, by the efforts of a detachment of 150 artilerymen, that over the Isere at Valenoe has been preserved. The Orleans journals, in addition to the details given previously, contain the following .- " The quays and all the low streets adjoining were stiU inder water, and the inhabitants were obliged to enter and leave their houses inboats. A great quantity of merchandise had been destroyed. The Mayorhad caused large quantities of bread to be baked for the sufferers, and had had live stock driven into the city by the peasants, to be placed in the markets and slaughter-houses. On the railway neither goods nor passenger trains were despatched from placoe below Orleans. Tho damage done to the growing crops in the neighbourhood of the city is representedc to be vgry considerable-far more tban that occasioned by the inundations of 1846. The wKoire continued to rise. up to 12 o'clock on Monday, when it attained 7 meties 10 centimetres; but by 3 o'clock it had fallean to, 6 metres 60 centimetres. and by 5 to 6 metres 50 centimetres. Unfortunately, this was caused by the break'ng of the dikes at Gien, Jargeau, Darvay, the IleArrault, St. Pierre, and St. Benoit, and by the river baving overidowed the dikes at St. Pryv6 and Clery. At Gien, where the dike gave way in two places, the suspensionbridge was swept away, and a house in the Rue dOrleans wa thrown down-a woman being kldled in the ruins All, the principal streets of the town and the sdaent plain foe. miles around were under water. Communications from the surrounding country with Orleans were' dntirely suspended. At St. Pryvc the wters rose'as high as tWe tops of 'the trees, and a newly-built house w*s partly-wasbed down; At St. Benoit, and the neighbon!ing communes, the inhabitants had to seek-refuge on.theleights. At Clerythe waters overflowed thedikes, 6l1ed- hriuihlyecultivated valleys of DryandClery, and causd4if is said', ' inbaldfilablelom' - In addition to all this, the bridge ovef the Allier -at' St. Germain-which cost more than ;2,000,000f., w# thrown downbythe-flood. At ViYzoa the waters rose 15 centimetres higher tban in the last inundations, inaTied the ironworkw, covered the quays and many of the streetw, threw downr three houses, ;aried awray a vast quantty of different objects, menaced one of the principal bridges on hie railway, and intemrpted tffic below the townu ansd on the lines to Bourne and C.ate0rnx At Toturs there were great disasters, and from the AIeraud the Cher also deplorable accounts were received." At Paris, yesterday, tickets for the railway to Tours ceased to be delivered. This shows that the fears which were entertained at Orleans on 31onday evening as to the interruption of communication between Tours and Orleans had been realized. Count Orloff, on his arrival atLyons,was detained for several days in that city by the inundations, which had interrupted c6mmunication on the Mediterranean railway, and could not leave until Monday for Montpeier to join the Countess and his son. This morning, at 8 'clock;, the Emperor started from Arles forAvignon, where he arrived at 10, anid a few minutes afterwards he left for Lyons. His Majesty was expected in that city at 4. The Emperor is expected in Paris to-morrow evening.

There are at this momernt three Paris mails dlue, in consequence, of the inundations which have interrupted the communication between Lyons and Marseilles. The waters of the Rhone rose betwlveen Thursday and Saturday last 4 feet 8 inches higher than during the gzeat inundation of 1840. UJntil Friday last the Paris mail arrived regularly at MIarseilles. Since then the railway has been broken up in several places between Tarascon and Graveson, and all communication is stopped on the left bank of the Rhone above Tarascon. The celebrated breakwater of Boulbon yielded to the pressure of the waters, and in a short time the town of Tarascon was completely flooded. The waters rushed thence over the plain which separates Tarascon from Arles, and the latter town was simultaneously flooded by the water rushing over the plain and that rising from the lower part of the Rhone. Although the level of the railway at Arles is 4 feet 8 inches higher than that to which the waters rose during the inundation of 1840, it has been flooded in several places. The waters reached the parapet of the viaduct between Tarascon and Beaucaire, but fortunately -without causing any serious injury. The suspension-bridge which unites the two towns is completely covered with water. The Rhone has likeewise overflowed its banks near Beaucaire and flooded the plain in the direction of Nismes, but the communication by railway between that town and Marseilles is still maintained. Avignon has not escaped the calamity which has befallen the neighbouring towns. Even the defences which were erected in consequence of the inundation of 1840 have been swept away. The town, thanks to its ramparts, has as yet been preserved. The communication, however, between the town and the railway terminus is completely intercepted. There have been accounts receivedfrom Valence dated Friday last, but none later. At that time the Rhone was rising slowly. The quays and the lower part of the town were inundated. The water was sis feet deep in some of the streets. Mlanv horses, oxen, and pigs were seen floating down the stream. Several large barges laden with coal were carried off from their moorings. Enormous losses have been sustained at La Pailasse and Wcure by the bursting of the embanl;nents. The electric telegraph was damaged, and despatches from Lyons ceased to arrive. Both the Rhone and the Saone had overflowed their banks at Lyons on Friday afternoon. The prefect had addressed a proclamation to the inhabitants. recommending them to adopt the necessary precautions, and several military engineers had been commuanded to examine the embanl;ments, and to render every assistance.
TRE AGRICULTURAL SHOW AT PARIS. [The folowing appeared ill our second edition of yes. teraay :-] (FROM OUR AGRICULTURAL CORRESPONDEUT.) -VAIW5, JVYE 4. WVe have now thorough Parisian weather, and everybody here seems to be maldng holyday. The Emperor has gone to Lyons for a few days to inspect with his own eyes the damage done by the recent floods, but the Agricultural Show was yesterday, for the second time, graced by the presence of the Empress, who spent some time in walking about the galleries, examining the various specimens of pro. ducts which are there displayed. Let us begin this day's description with the products of her native country, Spain. There is but one province, that of Catalonia, which sends a collection; but it is exceedingly well arranged and complete. It is shown by the AgLicultural Society of San Isidro, and we had the good fortune to hear it explained by the founder and president of the society, the Conde de Forollar, Marquis de Palmerola. This gentleman, -when the judges went round, was present at his stand to answer all questions, was familiar with every detail of cultivation, pointed out the industrial uses of certain plants, and explained the qualities of his various wines anld the history of their progress. Hie gave that kind of information which men of the same rank with us usually get at such exhibitions. If one might form any opinion of the noblesse of Spain from this gentleman, we may hope yet to see that fine country making rapid strides in material prosperity. The society which he founded, and which is t-e only agricultural society in Spain, has greatly promoted improvement, Catalonia being now far in advance of the rest of Spain. Wine is the chief product of the province, and 103 different varieties are shown. *We did not venture to taste so extensive a stock, and cannot therefore offer an opinion on their quality, butthe boutwtet was delightful, and the judges testified their unqualified approval by awarding them a gold medal. Of lentils and beans of different kinds there are 39 varieties exhibited, all grown in the province as articles of field cultire. The samples of maize are extremely fine. There is a very good white wheat from near Barcelona, and a price is quoted on the different samples exhibited as a test of their local value. There are 14 different kinds of almonds, very large varieties of walnuts, common nuts, figs, oranges, and lemons. Then 'there is tobacco, liquorice, hemp, cork, saui4ages, and cheese. There are oils of various kinds; but, as amatter of business, the agricultural product likely.to be most direcfly useful to England in this collection is the article termed algarobas, which grows on a species of acacia tree, found in great profusion all along that part of the coast of Spain, and probably to be met with on all parts of the seacoast of the Mediterranean. It is used as the principal food of horses and mules, is sweet to the taste, in shape like a podded bean or large pea, -with seeds in the centre. It is the mne article which has been latelyimportedfromEgyptunder thename of locusts, or St. -John's breod, and which is nor selling in London, as cattle food, at about SI. a-ton. It may be got in any quantity at Barcelona, at the price of 5f. per 100 kilogrammes, which is little more than Ps. a ton. It is shown aso as a product of Sicily, [ ande te nueof {caroiib>," Wnd ia lIke1ytsbe gob I in great abundance) if there should be any demand 'for it. The English seem to have putit to aWrong u- in giving it to cattle, as it is exclusively applied tf - the feeding of horses and similar5stock in Spain' Yrt trust that this notice of it may induce some of tY87 Spanish merchants to import it from Barcelona, MS it may be sold with an excellent profit at one-half the price now sought for it in London. A cheap food for horses is one of the great desiderata of .Egn lish agriculture, and would tend more than almost anything we know to diminish the cost of produc-.- tion, and to set free a large surplus for the con. - sumption of man. Better far that we should inr port cheap horse food and cattle food than cheap and inferior grain as human food, thus enabling us to reierve the better qualities of grain now consuned. by our horses to give bone and muscle to our agri. cultural population. By an easy step across the galery we reach the Sardinian collection, which is small and not very interesting. Orange wine and orange vinegar, with a smaU collection of cereal seeds, comprise it all, ex. cept a specimen of guano, of light specific gravity* and dark gray colour, which is produced byv: bats in grottoes near the sea, and is therefound in great abundance. It has only come into use during the last two years, but is now extensively and successfiuly employed as a manure for aU the purposes of agriculture. Next: to this collection is a small mauty box from the Pon-, tifical States, containing little shabby specimens of a few grains each of the different Tarieties of corn produced under that happy rule. Alas ! is this all that is left of the agricultural science of Cato? Is the soil that was turned by the plough of Cincinnatus less productive than it was 2,500 years ago ? Even taste seems to have been lost in the lapse of time, for the box which contains this poor collection, representing the products of a State once the mistress of the world, would bring discredit on the skill of s village carpenter. Turn we now to Switzerland. Here -we have the results of industry and free institutions. In cattleand products Switzerland is one of the largest exhi-- bitors at this international show. It is, indeed, a mountainous country, but the valleys are richl, for fat and green must be the pastLres which produce such cattle, and warm the hill sides which yield both barley and wine. A little memoir is conveniently attached to each of the various products, by which, without trouble, we learn their history. There is the white wine of Malans from the Upper Rhine, white and red wine of the Valais, red wine of the Canton dce Vaud, barley grown 1,200 metres above the level of the sea among the hills of the Grisons, and mniTetfrom a richsoil onthe borders oftheRhine. Then there is red wine named "Cortai7laud" of vintage 1853, which gains a silvermedal, and is sold at 3s. a bottle; Malvoisie, by the same maker, at 3s. 4dNext we have fresh butter from the Alps, rewarded, by a silver medal; then cheese of the mountains and cheese of the low cotmtry. Then we have Alpine honey, which gets a si7ver medal, and is priced at about 7d. an English pound. Next ccmes cheese from the Merlaz, among the high 'mountains of the Gruyere, in the canton of Friburg, where we learn that 110 quarts of miilk7 yield 2G6Mb. of cheese. There are specimens of kirsch, a liqueur distilled from black cherries, which are cultivated on the Righi, 1,200 metres above sea level. Here is a cheese made at the religious house of Bellelay, in the Canton de Berne, which sells at Td. a-pound. This particular quality is now produced only on the four: farms belonging to this monastery. It is rich, and. improves by age. Nt. Karlet, of Erlenbach, offers a cheese of 1855 at4d. a-pound, made inlthe mountains of Simmenthal, while he asks Sd. a-pound for the same cheese upwaards of 20 years old. M. MIarina will give you fresh apples of the qualityhe exhibits at a halfpenny a-pound, and dried ones at a penny. Solidified and soluble milk is shown fiom the neighbourlhood of Geneva, which willkeep fresh for 15 days. From Sicily, besides the carobllas or St. Joam's bread already referred to, there are specimens of corn, nuts, woods, citron, and oranges. There is the manna wood yielding a sweet exudation like sugarcandy, besides figs, siLk, and cotton. There is also Sicilian cheese of good quality, shaped like little tirnips. From Saxony there are fleeces from the Electoral flock of sheep, which is said to yield wool of the finest quality and staple. Prussia contributes very little to the show. A gardener of Quedlinburg is the sole exhibitor of her cereal and leguminous products, while a gentleman named Sall showvs two samples of wine by way of comparison, the one pure, the other diluted with water. There are hams from Westphalia, Dutch cheese, souda and edam from Holland, tobacco fromGueldres, plants grown on the soil whence the Lake of Haarlem has been drained, and preserved vegetables from Calembourg in the Low Countries. The Dutch collection is highly creditable, and the exhibitors carry off 11 medals from the Exhibition. Denmark also comes out extreme,y well, and takes a gold medal for the excellence of its general collection. All the cereals, except oats, the one which we believe she chiefly exports, are good. Mr. Dethlef Jurgensen, a contractor of Flensburg, obtains a gold medal for his show of mess beef and pork. Draicage pipes of various sizes and shapes and of first-rate quality show that the old art of tile- - making has not been lost in that part of Europe, though it seems to have migrated from the Dutch to the Danes. Five medals only, and of the lower denomination, go to the vegetable product exhibitors of 13elgium. An artificial guano, made from fish, and said to possess similar properties with Peruvian, is shown fromi this country. The price stated is aboult Sl. 8s. a-ton, and it is said to have its qualities so combined as to suit every particular crop. The' farmer in ordering his supply has only to indic-ate the nature of his soil, the crop to be raised, anrd the crop previously grown, and the manufacturer will then send him the article he needs. 'We are consoled by observing thatthe art of puffing artificial manures is not confined to our own country. Bavaria takes a silver medal for her small collection of products. The magnificent territory which submits to the rule of Austria sends only a fewmanties and Hungarian cloaks, a few bottles of cider, and some firkins of lard, none of which, so far as we learned, were deemed worthy of even a mndaillc de bro=ne. There are many advantages in organization. The English Agricultural Society keeps aloof, as a society, from this great exhibition. It gives no aid to its members who are here as exhibitors, furnishes them with no information, affords them no point of common meeting to assemble on the spot and urge, as a body, such improvements in arrangement as they may find it needful to suggest to theo French managers of the Exhibition. The Scotch National Society, on the contrary, appears here by its secretary and a deputation, meet every morning to consult about arrangements, co-operate in everything with the exhibitors, and facilitate all their movements. The Scotch shepherds, about 80 of whom are here in charge of their masters' stock, are kept together like a family party. The deputation, onthe suggestion of their secretary, have laid aside a small fund, which is being expended in taking the men to see some of the objects of interest here. A party of 40 go to-day to Versailles, under the charge of one or two memberi of the deputation, while another party of about the same number will in their turn take a similar holyday to-morrow.

IONEAB?KBTa&d CYLLIc. * -- . , . . ThursdayEvenig, The Engbl.sh funds opened thiamorning at a recovety of an eighth, and, although there was afterwards a slight renewal of heaviness the market ultimately regained its wone, aind ciosed with a firm appearance. Consols for money were first quoted i t4q to A, whence they recede-d to 94k. The de. livery of the letters by the American mail theni produced a favourable effect, the dismissal of M1r. .Crampton being still in doubt, and the last official -transactiors were at 94a to A for money and 95 to i f6r the 10th of July. After regular hours, howvever, i consequence of intelligence of a further heavy fall on the Paris Bourse, there were sellers -for the account at 95. The scrip of the New Loan left off at 1 premiun1n Bank Stock, 217 to 218; Reduced, 93&, to J ; New Three per Cents., 93i to 94; India Stock, 233 to 236; India-bonds, Is. discoumt to 2s. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 9&1 to 99; and Exchequer-bills, Is. discount to 2s. premium. M.oney was in good supply to-day in the StockExchange at from 4i to 5 per cent., and in the dis:count-market the demand was limited. Foreign securities exhibited heaviness, and prices were generally lower in the later hours. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 99i and i, --andthe Four per Cents. Guaranlteed at 1031 for -money and 103i and - for the account. Mlexican presented a depressed appearance, zales having inc:eased. For money bargains took place at 22i and Z, and for the account at 221, 23, 22i, and The general operations comprised-Brazilian, 100k, 101, and 100; Buenos Ayres, for the accoiunt, 78 and 76.1; Danish Five per Cents., 103; Russian Five per Cents., 108 and 1O71; the Four-and-a:Half per Cents., 908 and 97 ; Sardinian Five per Cents., for the account, 91j and 924; Spanish Three per Cents., for the axcount, 47 and 47i; the Newv Deferred, 25k; Venezuela, for aocount, 3(0 and 30; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65. The final quotations from the Paris Bourse this evenig were 73f. for money and 73f. 15c. for the end of the month, showing a fresh decline of more than a half per cent., making a total fall of two per cent. viibin a week. The private letters state that the pressure for money on the Bourse is excessive, and that any further increase of difficulty might bring on a severe panic. The prospectus has been issued of the Euphrates VaLey Railway Company, with a capital of 1,000,0001., in 201. shares, for which the promoters rely upon obtaining a guarantee of 6 per cent. from the Turkish Govemrnent. The linewill be 80 miles in length, and its features and advantages were described in The Tihnes of the 20th ult. General Chesney is to be the consulting engineer. The specie from New York by the Atlantic today is 42,0001.; and, although the rate of exchange vas becoming rather less favourable for this country, a larger sum nay be expected by the Asia on Mlonday. The private advices on this occasion state that the last despatch of Lord Clarendon on the enlistment question had produced a most satisfactory effect, and that many persons were disposed to believe the difficulty might be looked upon as virtually settled, and that Mr. Crampton would not be required to leave. This idea, indeed, seems to have become very general anong the leading merchants, and the stock-market had responded to it, but the tone of the lVashington Union, the Government organ, is far from conveying a similar impression. The rally in most descriptionsof securities amounted tooneortwopercent. Erie Rtilway was quoted 55L;- ReadinD, 8S; Panama, 99M; and Illinois Central B3ondls, SG. The advices from MIexico reach to the 3d of May, and explain the dispute which has arisen vith Spain. It appears that the Government have issued an order requiring the holders of Spanish Convention Bonds to deliver them into the Treasury for their origin to be revised, the plea being that some improper credits were admitted into the Convention when it was effected two or three years ago. The bonds having hitherto been paid, and having clhanged hands in the course of time, it is denied that the Government have any right to revise an act tacitly recognized by themselves for so long a period, and the measure had therefore been resisted by the Spanish Legation, and had at length assumed a grave character, which rendered a rupture imminent. The commercial letters mention that M. Payno, the Finance 3inister, has in preparation some financial scheme which is to create a great sensation, and the foundation of which is said to be the issue of aLout $15,000,000 of paper money. Serious disturbances continued to take place among the labourers in the south, who insist uipon working on their own terms, or sacking and destroying the estates. The public roads were still infested 'with robbers in every direction. The foliowing is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders *- The committee have received advices from lr. W'hitehead, dated Mexico, 3d ilt. The country was quiet, but no progress had yet been made in the execution of the decree of the 31st of March last, by which the Government assumed the administration of the Church property in the diocess of Puebla. The packet brings no remittance for the dividend fund. The agents of the bondholders in Mazatlan had, however, secured $21,148, which have been shipped by Ier iMajesty's steamer Cockatrice." Another bank disclosure took place yesterday in the Vice-Chancellor's Court on a petition for windinguptheCheltenhamand Glocestershire Joint Stock B'ank. According to the petition, the concern was established in M1ay, 1836. A Mr. Ridler was the manager, and in January last the directors discovered a considerable deficiency in the securities; and while the amount of the loss, which was shortly found to have swept away the whole capital of the bank, was still uncertain, they prepared or sanctioned the presentation of a report to the proprietors recommending a dividend of 5 per cent., and stating that after its payment the profits of the half-year would leave a surplus. In extenuation of their conduct the directors seem to put forth the common plea, that thev were no parties to the delinquency by which the bank had been ruined, and that the-report in question was concocted in order to prevent a sudden run, which would have increased the embarrassments of liquidation. Their counsel contended that their conduct had been " most wise and judicious ;" and, although the Court could not express actual concurrence in this view, there appears to have been the disposition usual in all such cases "to avoid casting the least censure" in any quarter. The retuirns of circulation of the Irish and Scotch banks for the four weeks ending the 10th of May, when added together, give the following as the average weekly circulation of these banks during the past month-viz. Average circulation of the Irish banks.. 6,511.913 Average circulation of the Scotch banks ... 3,938,006 Average circulation during past month ...

,IW L W.PORT. COURT OF CHAN=YN. LN-s-m3. 3Tm\ a WLSEMBOThL'E V. WOODCOCK (BWforc iac LoBDs JUsTIcFs of APPEAL.) This was an appeal mioton from a decision of Vioe-Chancellor Stuart, refusing an injunction to restrain an action. The facts appeared to be that the late Mr. Willin Washbourne, a wine-merchant, of the city of Glocester, had for many years had in his hands 4001. belonging to the de-' fendant, Miss Woodcock, which was -secured byajroims sory-note. In Augst, 1854, Mr. Washbourne die, being at that time supposed to be in prosperous ccuIstanbes, bat in a short time was found zo he in insolvent circumstances. Soor after, this was discovered, 3Lr.Trederick Woodcock, anepbew of dzs.Waahbourne and of MissWoodcock, and who had acted as solicitor for thelate 3Mr. Wash. bhurne, called upon Mr. Williim Washbourne, his son, aua inquired.whether his mother, who hiad been appointed sole executrLx of her late husband, couldj out of her husband's assets, pay off the 4001. due upon the pronussory note. Upon being answered in the negative, he said his, aunt, Miss Woodcock, must have some other security. - The subject was mentioned to the widow, and she executed a bond prepared by Mr. Frederick Woodcock, and charged against her as executrix in his bill of. costs; and, upon her asking what she was to do with the old prormissory note, he replied she might do as she pleased withi it, burn or other. wise-destroy it, asit was of no use now the bond was.given; and the note was accordingly destroyed. The bond was given by MErs. Washbourne,-as executrix of herhusband, but the condition did not so express. Miss Woodcock sued Mrs. Wasibourne upon the bond, as a debt for which she was personally lable, whereupon Mr' Washbourne filed her bill for an injunction to restrain the action. Among the evidence it was shown that Mr Washbourne had paid Miss Woodcoclk interest upon two occasions, and in each the former was described as "executrix." TheVice-Chancellor refused the injunction, and immediately afterwards a capias ad atisfaciendumn was issued by Miss Woodcock agaliat MIrs. Washbourne, who was obliged t6 uit her house to avoid arrest. She now appealed from the1 decision of theVice-Chancellor. Mfr. G. L. RIUSSELL and Mr. X&Y appeared in support of the a p peal, and contended that the only object of Mrs. Washbourne in giving the bond was to p ledge the assets of her late husband for payment of the ..., and only to subsStitute the bond fort th note and in no way to render herself personally liable. Lord Justice XMzGHTr BRUCE.-Are you willing to bring the 4001. into court? Mr. G. L RUSSELT.-The widow is not able to do sw She has not the money, and the estate of her late husband iswholly insufficient topay his debts. So longasit ws believed that the husbandcs estate was prosperous no cas was made of the personal liability of th .adg LordJustice KMIGqro BRuCZ.-Is the solicitor for Mrs. Washbourne willing to hndertake that she shall be personal; forthconuing if the Court thinks it neoessary ? Mr. G. L Russ;m.-Yes,he is; he gives the undertaldne. Lord Justice XEsGnIT BRnUCE asked Mr. Wigram and Mr. Hetherington w'hat more the defendant required. Mr. WIGRA u said the money was wanted, and if thelady were arrested it would be obtained. TLora JusticeIKXGnrT BRuCE said -tie cause might be ripe for hearing in a fortnight, if either aide possessed any common sense in the matter. Ultimately it was arranged that! rs. Washbourne andafr. Frederick Woodcock should tender themselves for exannination vird voce, and the cause be heard upon an early day (Tuesday next), no execution to issue against the lady without leave of the Court.

VICE-CIANCEOLLRS' COURTS. Tum- . h HESSE V. ffLaAST. (Before Vice-ChanccUor Sir J. STTRJT.) This was a bill by a purchaser against a vendor for the speciiic performance of a contract for the sale of real estate. The defence set up -was that the agent for the vendor was tho solcitor for the purchaser in the matter of hispurchase. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Henry Stevens were for the plaintiff, and Mr. MaImis and Mr. Giffard for the defendant. The VICE-CHACENLLOR said that the rnle wtS that the solicitor of the vendor should not buy for himseif or for another person. In this case, although the agent for the vendor had acted as the solicitor for the purchaser in other matters, and had been consulted byhbim respecting the purchase in question, the evidence showed that the purchaser had acted for himself in the transaction, and not through his solicitor, the vendor's agent. But it had been said that a solicitor had no power, while acting as the agent of one client in the matter of a sale, to treat with another client -who acted for himesdl ae did not think thait -the rule already referred to could be carried to such an extent; for the argunient amounted to this-that a man would be incapable of entering into a contract for the purchase of property because he pleased to emaploy professionaUya person -who was the agent for sale of another. If there were any doubt as to the fairness of the transaction, er there -vere a reasonable colour for treating the vendor's agent as the agent also of the purchaser, it would be the duty of the Court to refuse relief to the plaintiff. But the case was one in which the defence entirely failed, and there must therefore be a decree for specific performance, with costs. (Before Vioe-OChanxe,-rSir W. P. WoOD.) MAN-BY V. EWlICIsE. Mr. ToLER moved in this case on behalf of a defendant who had been made a party to the suit by amendment for the usual order against the plaintiff for security for costs The suit has been several times before the Court on interlocutory applications, and is instituted for the recovery of very large estates in Lincolnshire. The plaintiff; who is a market gardener, was described in the bill as of No. 11, Kiln-yard, Louth, in the county of Lincoln; but it ap. peared by the affidavits now read to the Court that since the month of Mlay, 1S55, he had never been at his residence; that every attempt had beenmade to meetwith him, but without success, that his solicitors declined to give any information as to his whereabouts, and, as evidence that he was intentionally keeping out of the way, it was further deposed that a writ was out against him for certain oosts curred in an action at law relating to the matters inquestion in the suit, but in which costs the party now moving had no interest whatever. The learned counsel also stated that orders had been made in the original suit that the plaintiff should make the usual affidavit as to documents in his possession, which orders it was necessary should be personally served, the solicitors declining to accept service, and he cited the case of "Bailey v. Gundry," 1 Keen, 53, for the purpose of showing that it was not necessary Lfor the paty moving to show that he was damnified by the plaintiff keeping out of the way; hut that it wag quite sufncient to show inJury and inconvenience to the other parties on the record. Mr. L WEBB, for the plaintiff, contended that this was only a repetition of a former motion which had been made by other defendants in the suit, and which his Honour had then refused. In the case cited it appeared that the plaintiff had absconded, which was certainly not the case here. As tothe affidavit of documents, a letter had been written by the solicitors undertaldng that it should be filed, and offering inspection. The VICE-CHANCELLOR, after referring to the report of his former decision in a recent volume of the Lazo JournaZ Beporta, said that the motion now before the Court materially differed from the former motion, inasmuch as the defendant now moving had no interest in the costs for which the writ had been issued, whereas the previous decision had been founded in a great measure on the clear inference in his Honour's mind that, although the party then moving professedly moved for security for costs, the real effect was to bring about a personal service of the writwhich hadbeen mentioned. Here there could be no such inference, and, as the application was clearly within the principle of the case cited, it must be granted. Usual orderfor security for costs. STORRY V. DUGGLEBY. This part-heard case, which was reeently noticed in T7ic !ri;1ls, was resumed.L The evidence, which was very con'dicting, having been read, his Honour, at the conclusion of the arguments, dismissed the bill v;ith costs. The case wasargued by 3z. Rolt and IMr. Smythe for the laintiff; and by Mr. Willcoek, 3r. Cairns, and Mr. I. wc. Hawkis for the defendant.
COURT OF QOUEENS BENCH. WE nxRrR- .Tirjv - THE o n V. SHORT_ (Sittings in Banco, bcfore Lord CA3iprrT. and .Tujtk COLERIDGE, EBRLE, and CROm iN.) This was a rule calling upon Joseph Short, an officer of the Sheriff of Cornxwall, to show cause why an attachmnent should not issue against him for extortion. In the case of " Gill and Co. v. Jose" a f. fa. had issued on the goods of the defendant, and the sheriffl's officer levied. He charged the defendant for three days' possession, and a further sum for mileage, both of which charges, it was alleged, were extortionate. MNfr. KasGDo-, now showed cause, and explained that the sheriff's officer had remained in psession at the special request of the defendant, who saiX he did not nind the expense, for he would not have itknown for .100 As to the other point, the officer had charged Cd. a-mile each way, and in so doing he had acted on the practice which had IODg prevailed in the county of Cornwall. The statute, the 7th wzlam I.and 1st Victoria, c. 55, enacted that the officer should charge &dL a-mile for mileage, hut said nothing as to whether it might be charged each way.- M,r. COLLIER supported the role. Lord CAnI'BELL said he was of opinion that a sufficient. answer had been made as to the possession, hut net as to the m-lileage. He (Lord Campbell) was concerned to fii'1 that in the county of Cornwall a practice had prevaile&whish was contrary to-the statute and to thezulks of Couri. lo special blame, however, rested ou the. officer in this instance, but the rule must be made alilcdute, and the applicant must have the costs of the application.

VÃ¯Â¿Â½SATsrrA1T. >AL-. iE. JAM]ES, Q.C., moved for arule to show cause why a new- trial should not be granted in this case.

According to the contract, the fdaitif ws bound to devote the whole of his time to e is duiieas en,gineer, and not to be engaged in any other employment or bstinesi whatever. But the meaning of that s-that he was to devote the whole of his time "during d he al hours to his duties as engineer, and it did not preclude him from recovering for extra services. In the case~of Taylor v. the same defendants, which was an action on , contract iu precisely the saine terms, it ws3 held that the rlaintiff was still entitled to recover for extraservices. - Lord CAUPBEU.-In that case there was an express promise proved, and the Court had to decide whether that was consistent with the contract. MIr. J ss said in thig case there was no express promise, but there was evidence for the Jury, from which the promise night be infered. There was the payment of the 200!, which the plaintiff said was given, not, as the company alleged, as a gratuity, but as payment. for extra servioes; and, in addition, the plaintiff, on his returni to Jndia, said he should expect the company to pay for extra sevioes, and in his reportslhe detailed thepartic ilars of the extra labours which he had been required to undergo. The ease was-left to the juryin the meet impartial manner, but the jury appcared to hesitate, and aslced the learned Judge whether ttere was evidence of a legal contract.

COURT OF COM[ON PLEAS, WzsTzdmsz, JUSE 4 GORDON V. IITEIORN. t-bUtiws in .Lano. m21ntti Lwm In this cae MIr. Serieant BYTEs and Mr. IusH wereheard to show cause against a rule. for a new trial; and Mr. HL, Q.C., and ifr. PETERSDORF inU pport of it. The plaintiff and defendant, it appeared, had agreed'that the defendant should have and pay for a certanplant' a. valuation to be made by the plaintiff, and that it should be paid for by a bill for 150!. at a certain timue after the valuation, and the balance at a certain other time, and no-pay-- rent was to be made till after the valuation. The 150. waspaid, but not till after an action had been brought. The present action was for the residue of the vaue of theplant, to which it was pleaded that no such valuation as the parties had stipulated for had been made. The Couar thought there was some evidence of a valua- tion, and the payment of the 16QI. was evidenoe that thedefendant had assented to the claim, and that the rulemust be discharged. Rule dischaaed. HUNGATE V. GADSDEN. In this case Mr. Serjeant Bvs showed cause agant a ruleforanew trial, on the ground that the verdict wasagainst the evidence, and Mr. Serjeant Thomas apueared in support of the rule. The action was for work and labour and commission on the sale of a quantity of oats and peas, to which the defendant pleaded never indebted, payment, and the Statute of Limitations. At the trial a question arose a to the proriety of adding a count on an account stated, which the lMrd Ciiief Justice, who tried the case, assented to, and the plaintiff's counscl immaediately called the attorney's derk, who proved the account stated. For the defendant it was ssumed that the whole evidence in support of this count was improvised for the occasion, and the. learned Judge, in summing up, took that view to the jury; who found for the defendant. It now appeared on the afidavits of, the plaintiff and his attorney that the attorney had given notice to the defendant before the trial that he intended to rely on the account stated. The CHnxs' JUSlTcE said if he had known this he should have summed up differently. The rule must be absolute, the costs to abide the event. SWv-FZN V. SW .IFEN. In this case the Attorney-General moved for a rule calling on the plaintiff to show cause why an att achment should not issue against her for disobedience of an order of the Court and for contempt of Court. This was an issue outof Chancery, brought to try the ri8ht to considerable propr. The plaintiff relied upon a wil executed by the late Mr. Samuel Swinfen, the due execution of which was altogether denied. At the trial the plaintiff's case occupied the whole of Saturday, and was ad3ourned, and before Monday morning certain conmnunications took place between himself (the learned AttorneyGeneral) on behalf of the defendant, the heir-at-law, and Sir Frederick Thesiger on behalf of the plsintiff aud it was agreed between them, the property being worth about 1,800!. a-year, that l,OOO. a-year should be settled on M1 Swinfen for her life, they thinking that, considering the position of the parties, it was better that each should take half a loaf than run the Sish of getting nothing at al. These terms having been agreed upon, an order at nisi primS was made embodying them, which was made a rule of Court. Mr Swinfen,. the plaintiff, now altogether repudiated that arrangement, and denied that she had given any authority to Sir Frederick Thesiger to agree to those terms. Cnief Justice Jnvis.-Take a rule. Rule granted. (Sittings at Kiri }Prius, at WcstminsCer.)

COUJRT OF EXCIEOUER. .TTTn. 5. snTPsOl V. LOWE. (Sitting in Banco.) .ar. n iisL.& movea, on the part of the plaintiff, te ehange the venue in this case from Bristol to London or Middlesex, on the ground that a fair and impartial trial could not R had in the venue originally selected by the plaintiff. The action was brought to recover damages from thedefendant foraneglect of hisdutyas architect,'ebaving been employed by the plaintiff in that capacity to superintend oertain building alterations. The cause had been already tried at Bristol before Mr. Justice Williams. when thejury returned a verdict for the defandant, ana -on a rule nui, for a new trial having been obtained by-the plaiitiff on the ground thst this verdict was opposed to the evidencek that learmed Judge reported that he Was ef opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict for nominal damages merely, but that he could not regret The-verdict which had been ven by the jury. When this rule came on to be discu;ssethis Court iade it _bsolute, and the immediate ground for the desire of the plaintiff to change the venue before going down to a second trial iras the publication of a report of that proceeding in this court in the sbape of a handbill, such report containing some very strong observations of the Chief Baron in giving judgment, the circulation of which among the citizens of BristoL from whom the jury would be selected, was, as he (Mr. Karalake) submitted, highly calculated to prejudice the plaintiffs chances of obtaining iustire- at Bristol, for there was no doubt that the first verdict was based on theprevailing prejudice against attorneys, of which unfortunate clam the plaintiff was one. To this abstract feeling a London or ,liddlesex jury would not be open; while those of Bristol had been operatel upon by the circulation of the report in question. The COURT having asked for the handbill, a copy was banded up, and proved on inspection to purport to be-as, indeed, it was-a copy of the report of the argument which appeared in our columns. The CHmZ BAnoN, havi perused the handbill, inquired whether the report, the circulation of which wa5 complained of, was a faithful acconnt of the proceedings in ihis court, Mr. lwsn.xz believed it to be so, but, whether correct or no, its circulation wag calculated to poison the mrinds of the jury; and on that ground he submitted that the plain. tiff was entitled to change the venue. The COURT, however, refused the rule. It was not - denied that the report which had been circulated in Bristol was a faithful one, and it would be an ill c"mpli,nent to this Court if it were to grant a rule to chan;ethe venue on the ground that what took place in it could in any way prejudice the mind of the wvhole jury panel of the city of ristotL SO also it would beno compliment to the citizenu of Bristol to suppose that in that populous community an impartial jury could not be found. In addition to these considerations, the change of venue would have the effect of' bringing a number of witneses a great disance from the locality in which the action arose, which rwa greAtly to be - deprecated. Tle rule must therefore bexref. Judgment accordingly. [On the appearance of our report to which allusion is; made above Mr. Simpson favoured us with a letter complaining of its inaccuracy. On that occasion we ventured to adhere to our report, and we trust that even Mr. Simpp-- son iis now sAtisfied of its accuracy.] (SiUtings at Nis Prius, before Mr. Baron AimEnsox andi oMnmon Jurics.)

This was an action brought by the steam tug Charm, to obtain compensation for alleged salvage services rendered to the ship Cyclone, on the 26th of becember last. The Cyclone, having arrived from Sydney x ith a valuable cargo, wvas about to enter the London docks, when, as asserted by the salvors, a bark caught her in the mizen-rigging, and they drove up with the tide a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile. The Cyclone then caught the ground on the New Crane muud, where she lay athwart the tide with her stern towards the shore, and above low -water mark. The Dougal and the Charm having wvith great difficulty got her into deep water, the Charm tbok her in tow alone, and safely docked her. On the part of the owners it was contended that the Cyclone never was ground at all; that the service only lasted 25 minutes, and was nothing more than ordinary towago, for which F?7 was a sufficient remuneration. The value.of the property salved was 65,666?. Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss were heard for the salvors the Queen's Advocate and Dr. Deane for the owners. The learned J-DGE considered that a salvage service had been rendered, but of a-very triNial kind. He would allot 2u5., bat would not certify for costs. TIrE GP.AVIN-A.-SALV AGE.

POLICE. GUILsDIIu LL-A tall respectably-dressed man, about 38 years of age, who refused his name and address, was placed at the bar before Sir 1. W. CARDEN charged with stealing a Church Service, value 7s. 6d., from the shop of Mr. Willis, bookseller and stationer, in Newgate-street. Arthur Messent said, he was assistant to Mr. Arthur Villis, and that on Wednesday afterncon, about 4 o'clock, he saw the prisoner in the shop, and the apprentice was attending to him. Having some suspicion of the prisoner's object, in consequence of a previous visit which he had made to that shop, witness put the apprentice on his guard respecting the priSOner's intentions. Arthur Stanaast, the apprentice, said, when the prisoner came iua he asked for some Church Services to inspect, and a single copy was shown to him. He asked to look at some of a Larger type, and witness accordingly brought ou3t two copies, which he showed to the prisoner, who requested that some of a still larger type might be shown to him. Mr. Mtessent then came forwvard and cautioned wiatness, who went round the counter while Mr. Messent was showine the books the prisoner asked for, and then discovered that one of the Church Services out of the second lot was missing. At that moment the prisoner put down the book he was looking at, and, saying it would not suit hinm, walked suddenly out of the shop. Mr. Messent, on being infornedthat a book was gone, said he saw a book in the prisoner's pocket as he was leaving the shop, aud witness accordingly ran after the prisoner and accused him of stealing a Church Service. He at first denied it, but immediately afterwards produced the book from his pocketandran away. He was, however, eventually secured. Sir R. W. CAuRDxES asked the prisoner for his name. The prisoner said he objected to state what his name was intil a friend he had sent for arrived to speak for him. The officer said, the friend the prisoner alluded to was Mr. Eagleton, the solicitor, of Newgate-street, who declined to come. Sir R. W. CARDE?N told the prisoner it would not tend to his advantage to conceal his name and address. The prisoner said, he had no objection to give his name. It was Edward Cobb, but hewould rathernot tell his address at present. The officer said, he found on the prisoner 5s. 3d. and three pawnbrokers' duplicates relating to a watch, a ring, and a book called "Maunder's Treasury of Knowledge." The latter pledge was a 10s. book, and quite new, and was pledged only 10 minutes before the prisoner entered Mr. Willis' shop. Sir R. . CARDEN said, he would remand the case till Saturday to enable the officer to make some inquiry relative tothe property i pledge, as it appeared to him that the prisoner dealt in watehes and rings aswell as books. The prisoner said, he was anxious that the case should be remanded. Sir E. W. CAnRDE recommended the prisoner to give his address, but he still declined, and he was then removed from the bar and ultimately conveyed to Newgate. MXurLno0or0Gr-ri:rREET.-A gentleman, accompanied by alady, statedto be the wife of Signor Ronconi, a singer at the Italian Opera, made the following application to Mr. BIssUM:- Madame Ronconi had been separated from Signor Ronconi for some time, her allowance from her husband being -94,OOfÃ¯Â¿Â½ a-year. A report having been spread abroad that Madame Ronconi was dead, the allowance was stopped, and Madame Roncon- had in consequence been reduced to great distress. She had come to this country to assert her claims, but she had not been able to induce her hlusband to do anythin" towards her support, on the unfounded plea of adt-dtery in Italy, and having at length pledged every available article for her sustenance she was now totaUy at a loss what to do to compel her husband to allow her out of his ample means-his professional income amounting to about 160,000f. a.year-a su.iiciency for her support. Mr. BisxsGH3r said, there was no difficulty in the case. The applicasit could either consult a solicitor or might apply to the authorities of the parish in which she was at present living. The applicant thanked the magistrate and withdrew. CLERREaI;IELL.-Benjamin Dalliston, Henry Jones, George Irving, George Hursent, and Reuben Harding, were placed at the bar on remand, before Mr. CORPIE, charged with being concerned, with others not in custody, in burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Xlessrs. Evans and Heywood, of Vaterloo-house, Battlebridge, and stealing therefromi a large quantity of silk dresses, barege dresses, silk scarfs, and silk mantles, of the value of 5001., and William Roberts, a shoemaker, of 17, Mdiddlesex-place, Somers-town, was charged with receiving the same, well knowing it to have been stolen. It appeared from the evidence that the prisoners, with the exception of Harding, are well known to the police as bad characters. On the-morning of Tuesday week, at about half-past 3 o'clock, a man named Johnson, a marble polisher, who lives next door to the prisoner Roberta, having been at work all night, heard a ca'o drive rapidly up to Roberts's door. He saw Irving and Roberts jump off the cab, and the door being opened at once they commenced removing from the cab a number of parcels of goods, which were placed in the passage of Roberts's house. Having his suspicions aroused, he communicated with White, 96S, and heand Sergeant Bellinghurst, 44 S, watched the house for some time,White having previously seen Roberts loitering about for some time. While they were so engaged the prisoner Roberts came out, and, passig those officers, went to the Pratt-street station-house, and told Sergeant Hill, 39 S, who was on duty there, that lie was awoke by a rumbling noise in the passage of his house, and upon going down stairs he saw in the yard severalpackages of goods. Billin"hurst went into the house and apprehended Dalliston, ana upon Roberts returning he also apprehended him. From t e information given to the police by Jolison, Edwards apprehended the whole of the other prisoners. The manner in which the robbery had been effected was at first a mystery, the whole of the doors being fastened; but it was afterwards discovered that an entrance had been made through the skylight, and the goods removed at the back. Roberts, Dalliston, and Jones were then charged with conimitting another burglary at the house of Mr. Stone, near the Caledonian-road. In this case Edwards, in searching the apartments of one of the prisoners, found a brooch which had been stolen along with numerous other things, from thG house of 'r. Stone some time back, and the prosecutor swore that he had seen Roberts near his house on the night in question, and it was proved that Dalliston had sold some of the stolen property. The prisoners, in defence, denied the charge, but said they knewwho had done "the job," and if they were admitted to bail they would give the offcers infornation. Harding who is a cabman, said lie was not the man who drove the cab, and if it were his cab it must have been taken off the stafnd and brought back again while he was asleep in the Mr. Wakeling, who appeared for Irvian, said, he was the son of very respectable parents, and couTa find substantial lr. CORRIE said, he must decline to accept bail for any of the prisoners. He would discharge Hnursent and Harding and would remand the others until Tuesday next. A checkfor2l.2s.,andGs. from "R. D.," has been received for the poor woman, Gill, who was accidentally shot in the arm, and who has thus been disabled from earning a living for herself and family. T}iAiUs.-Mr. Charles Lianly, a master tailor, residing and carrying on business at No. 2. Bow-lane, Poplar, appeared on a sulmmons before MIr. SELFE, charged with indecently assaulting Frances Pocock, a young marred woman, and residing, until Wednesday, in the same house as the defndant. The L.c-ISTRiATE said, the prisoner had been guilty of the most unjustifiable violence, accompanied with gross indecency, towards avirtuous young woman of highly respectable character. lie did not know whether he ought not to com-mit him for along term of imprisonment, w-ithout the option of paying a fine. He sentenced the prisoner to pay a penalty of 101., or be imprisoned for two months. The prisoner instantly paid the fine, and left the court laughling. SoUTwvi,Rw;.-Jane Beagam, a respectable-lookingyoung woman, with an infant in her arms, the wife of a compositor employed on the AImintg JOt7-n, was brought before Mr. Coaurs, charged with stealing a box containing :30 sovereigns, five watches, and some deeds, the property of a w idow named Eliza Powell. lMr. Co3s.Ni said the case was extremely suspicious against the prisoner, and in order to give the constable an opportunity of making further inquiries he should remand her for a week.
ERsATA.-Several blulnders (the fault of the telegraph) occurred in our American intelligence published yesterday. Tho Senate had given permission to Dr. Kiane and party, not to Dr. Pane, to accept acknowledgments from the British Government. The quotation respecting Lord Clarendon's "timely and welcome desp)atch" was from the Nezo York Jouruni2 of Commerce, not the Journa*Z; and the statement that the same despatch had been favourably received by the business conimunity was from the Commercia List, not the " commercial list."

The following is a copy of a division order, dated June the 3d, issued from the camp at Aldershott:- " "The lieutenant-General, having received notification ofI the departure of several regiments of militia stationed in the camp, takes the opportunity to request the xegiments of nlitia-nmel South Glocester, Leicester, Sussex, Worcesier,Antrim ifles, East or4 Dnblin, Hereford, Cambridge, Xohrthx Lincoln, BiEthorne, Hants, Eerry, GaiwaY, London, Somerset, Surrey, and Cavan, to ascept the expression of his thanks for thei: excellert conduct during the time he has hadthe honour to conmmand them, and of hls sincere regret at parting with them. " It is difficult for troops to have given less trouble to their Gereral than bas been the eom with the militia who have been quartered at Aldershotb * '(he UlnViea ieal of aU ranks in domng their dulty and the nvariable attention tho Lieutcnan.t.General has experienced in meeting his wishes, fronm tha highest to the lowest, it would neither be consistent with justice nor with his feelings to pass macknowledged. "The country may well be p,roud of its militia. Had another year's war called for their services, the LieutenantGcneral has been practicallg acquainted from the experience of the last year how that call would have been answered. "During that year the Iieutenaut-General has had 27 regiments of militia, English and Irish, under his command, andtherehas not been one of those 27 regiments whose general efficiencyand capacity for all purposes of soldiers would not have done credit to any reglar corps in Europe." Five of these regiments have already left camp, also the first division of the Royal Elthorne. The latter regiment, in consequence of its strength, goes in three divisions on separate days, but all the otheis can leave in one day. All are to be out of Aldershott by the end of the week.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of yesterday your notice of the proceedings of the City Sewers Commission accidentally misrepresents the effect of a portion of Mr. E2ywood's Report, upon the fitness of the A ylestord pipes for the purpose of forming sewers and honse-drains"' as you wiill see by the following letter:- " Enineer and Surveyor's-offlce, Guildhall, June 5. "Gentlemen,-That portion of the abstract of my report, to which you allude, and which appeared in Tie Times of yesterdays ins error; my reporb reads thus,-' The question is, whether in such localities porosity such as that of the Aylesford pipes opens them to objections sudicient to justify their interdiction; my opinion is that it doesnot.' And this opinion is reiterated in the general conclusions at the end of the report, which are given in eztenso in the paper. " I find, upon looking at the fair transcript of my reporb that the words ' the questionis whether' have been omitted; this omission I have since supplied, but it may account for the abstract of the report being written as it was.

THE Qumes BiRTHDAY AT M LTA.-Tee usual rejoicin s took place in celebration of Hler Majesty's birthday on Saturday, the 24th of May. From the Palace, the forts, public offices, and naval department the IRoyal standard of Great Britain was displayed. The ships of war (English and French) were dressed out in flags innumerable, and all the foreign Consuls (excepting the Russian, not yet returmedto his post) hoisted their national colours on their respective flagstaffs. At noon Royal salutes were fired from Fort St. Angelo and the Upper Barracca, the guns of which latter were served by the native Militia, and from the Royal Albert, Hibernia, and other British and foreign ships of war in port, and by the Royal Horse Artillery, drawn up on the glacis at Floriana, facing Valetta harbour, the line walls overlooking which were studded vith troops (English and native)Highlanders, Fusileers, Rifles, Artillery, Militia, and Fencibles, vwhile the Italian Legion turned out at Fort Manoel, all firing a fel dc joie, followeed by three hearty cheers. he Iaeutenant- General Commanding, Sir John l'ennefather, entertained a large military party at dinner, including Generals Lord Gough, Sir Colin Campbell, Sewel, and Brigadler General Runmley, the Colonel Commandant of the Italian Legion, Lieatenant-Colonel Burnaby, the Captain Commandant of the Malta Militia Artillery, the Colonels commanding the regiments in garrison, Atillery, and Engineers, the Commissary-General to the Forces and Storekeeper to the War Department, the Senior Chaplain to the Forces, and the whole of the Staff. Rear-Admiral Sir Montagu Stopford, the Superintendent of Malta Dockyard, entertained at his residencethe French Port Admiral, Sir F. Penaud (who wore the Order of the Bath), the Captaius and Commanders of the ships of war in port, the respective officers of the dockyard, factory, victualling establishment, and Naval Hospital, the Naval Chaplain, the Superintendent of the Ports, and the Solicitor of the Naval Departments. The healths of Her Majesty the Queen, Prince Albert, and the Royal Family, the Emperor of the French, the Empress, and the Prince Imperial were drank vith all due honours, Admiral -Penaud returning thanks in a very neat speech for the compliment to his Sovereign and the E;mpress. In the evening Lady Stopford had a dancing party. On the Monday his E-cellency the Governor. Sir William Reid, gave a splendid ball at the Palace to upwards of 600 of the principal residents of the island, and dancing was kept up until nearly sunrise. THE A sEMAW YA031r SYvV3E.E.-So0U11AN=o, June 5.-This splendid specimen of American marine architecture sailed from this port for *New York in charge of Captain Comstockl, who brou-ht her into these waters in 1S53. The Sylvie is douhtiess the fastest cutter yacht afloat, arising from the peculiarity of her construction, which includes every requirement necessary to insure speed and safety. Although of nearly 200 tons measurement, the Sylvie draws only about 4 feet 6 inches of water, but by the use of a series of shifting boards or sliding keels, which drop below the bottom a depth of about seven feet, she is rendered in strong winds particularly stiff, and when sailing the boards remove the necessity of using shifting ballast. For some time past the Sylvie has been the property of Messrs. Croskey and Co., of this port, but within the last few weeks was purchased by a gentlemani of N'ew York for aquatic racing on the American seaboard. The first cost of the vessel was immense, her original possessor having expendedupwards of $20,000 in her constraction. For the purpose of enabling the yacht to make a safe voyage across the ocean it was deemed prudent considerably to lessen her immense spars sni !i!t, and should the weather prove at aU favourable,*it :e- ;Ue-dshewillreachherdestinationinfrom 25 to S0 days. There are on board besides the captainseven hands, and 4hie vessel is provisioned for 90 days. During the time the Sylvie was lying in the Southampton docks she was greatly admired, her fine but peculiar lines beig so entirely different from the principles adopted in English yacht building. Eter first rnm across the Atlantic from Haslifax to Haiare was made in 16.1 days. FonnEro- LEGIo.s.-'Yeste:day was published a copy of the different conventions and agreements as to pay and allowances, either while serving or on discharge, made with the officers and men of the different foreign legions in the British service. Each recruit was to be enlisted for the duration of the late war, and until one year after the ratification of a treaty of peace. The recruits were to be at least 5 feet 2 inches high, and under 35 years of ae. Liberty was given to enlist abroad " men of aU nations of Europe," and also to eagage in the unitedkingdom Poles, Hungarians, Swriss, Danes, and Germans, being in this country. The bounty money w;as to be 6l. All non-commissioned officers, drmnmers, and privatDes vwili receive a gratuity of one year's pay aftertheir services have e.xpired, and be shipped home lif they wish it), at the cost of Government. Incapacitated soldiers will receive a life allowvance not exceeding the Chelsea out-pensioners, which must be received (unless by special permission to the contrary) in the united kingdom. The pay of the officers is to be allowed at the same rate as for British officers, and on disbandment they are to be allowed three months' pay to carry them home. If invalided by service, Her Majesty wil make provision for each particular case, according to her discretion. A SAD CAsE--Some years ago a manied man removed from Virginia to Missouri, taking with him a youngfemaleslave, a mulatto, of remarkable beauty and great intelligence, who had been horn in his family. Though a married man, he became the father of a child by this young wom.an. Having been nnsuccessful in his business i:n Missouri, he resolved to remove to one of the Eastern States, and, as the woman in question would have become free by her removal, and as his wife would, under no circumstances, consent to his bringing the girl with him, he gave her free papers for herself and his child, and left for the east. These hpapers were afterwards found to be invalid, not having been recorded, but she remained numolested by her master for six years, during which time she married and became a member of a religions commumion in Mlissouri. By this marriage she had another child, but was left a widow, after which she supported herself and her two children by her labour, maintaining a high character for persevering indastry, probity, and every, womanly virtue. About three years since her former master returned to the place of her residence on a business errand, and met her accidentally in the street. Upon conversing with him, sne asked him to make her free papers valid by having themn properly recorded, which he promised to do if slhe would bring them to his lodgings the next day. She brought the papers with her on the following day, when, after some conversation with her, her master proposed that she should resume her former illicit relations with him. She in vain urged that her religious principles and the life that she had led since her former connexion with him rendered it impossible for her thus to degrade herself. He persisted, and, finding her immovable, he became furious, tore up the papers she had placed in his hands, and the next day put her in the slave pe for pubic sale. Some persons who knew her, hearmug of her situation, interposed in her behalf, and one of alawye, had knowledge of a fact which he thought might be the means of securing her freedom. Her master had left the State in debt, and after her departure one of his creditors attached the girl as his property, but was induced to relinquish the attachment on recivmg a letter from her master declaring that she was free. This letter was obtained, and a suit was commenced, and the girl released from prison, one of her friends, a slaveholder himself, becoming security in a bond of 2,000 dollars that she should render herself and her children up if the suit should be decided against her. The suit has been pending for three years; and her alleged master having again got into difficulties, her friends are soliciting subscriptionstopurchase her entire freedom. Towards the suxm required-S dollars-upwards of 400 dolars have been collected for the purpose.-Nfo York zJournal of Conamerce.
PALMEr'S CASE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TrMES. Sir,-The insertion of my letter in the columns oEt 2e Tirmes in vindication of my unhappy client, Plmer was worthy of your uniform spirit of liberality ma fAIZ Play. In the leading article of this day, while you pay to my motives an honourable tribute, you at the same time re-open the whole of the case with an ability which, upon first viete, lends to its features the complexion of death. You statethu following:-" His (Palmer's) guilt, on the contrary, WaS demonstrated by a clear chain of reasoning, ,hich inevitably connected him with the crime." In this statement yoo beg the whole of the question by assuming a murder had beext committed, and all the brilliant invectives which follow are founded upon a fallacious assumption. I boldly and fear. lessly state that no case of poisoning was prored in Paler's case. The whole spirit of the Criminal Law was reversed, and the crime itself remained unproved. This was the difai. culty which required all the invectives and oratoric powers of the Attorney-General to dispose of, You agan state, "Even if Professor Taylor's theory with regard to the.absorption of strychnine be -proved by subsequet ex. perments to he erroneous, enough appeared at the trial, not only to warrant, but to necessitate the condemrnation of Palmer." This in plain reality means, it strychnine when adminis. tered should be discoverable, still Pahner was guilty Of administering strychnine, although it was not discovered. I appeal to you, Sir, whether such reason as this be worthy of the inteLlect of 17zc 71Times. You again state, " Mr. Smith should remember that the chymical evidence with regard to the presence or absence of strychnine was one thing, the medical symptoms quite another. It is not of course for us to suggest what conside. rations may have acted with greater force upon the minds of the jury, but we should have thought the medical symp, toms and the manner of their succession quite conclusive.) Now, if this theory be a true one-namely, that medical symptoms should rank above chymical evidence, that superficai sins are entitled to graver and weightier considera. tions than the secret sources from which they spring, the coroner's iqnest and post -zortem examination should be altogether abandoned. You also state that "strychnine was there, but that the manipulations of Professor Taglor were unskilfully performed." Do you not think that the context leads to a more natural and easy conclusion, namely, that the manipulations werc correct, but that the poison did not exist? Surely Professor Taylor is not at one time to be held up as an unerrin authority upon the part of the Crown, and when his testimony comes in favour of the prisoner to be put down as a, blundering operator. You travefrom the chymical and medical proofsof the case to the circumstantial evidence. fr. SerjeantShee gave whatI believe was the naturalcoinplexion to the evidence, w-hich is perfectly reconeileable with innocence, notwithstanding all that hac been said. Relative to this circumstantial evidence, it alppears to me like a fine road leading to a swamp, for if stryhnine be not found-and science demonstrae it canbe-of awvatvalLe is the circumstantial evidence? You further say-" For the salke of public security the Home Secretary wiU not, we trust, listen to any of the. miserable attempts which have been made to throw con. fusion over a case which admits of no doubt whatever," I trust that the Home-offlce, as the grand medium of communication between the Crown and outramed justice, will listen to the all-important fresh evidence which will be placed before them. Fortunately, there exists a golden lnk between the Sovereign upon the throne and the criminal in the cell; that link is the Eome-offlce. This in some measure atones for the frightful anomaly in law, which, while it allows appeals in civil cases, allows of no appeal where life and death are at stake. I feel proud to say that a considerable reaction has taken place in public opinion relative to Palmer's case. Tha peoDle are beginning to think that he was found guilty, not upon what was proved against him, but what remains unproved, simply because murder was assumed. This is dangerous ground, and malkes men tremble for their rights and liberties. I will trespass upon your space at no greater length; nor ever again trouble you upon the question. I have watched the case through all its progress with all the poor ability I could command,, and only fear I have omitted for my client much that might have been said or done for him. I now know my client's case-its wealmess and its strength, whereit is clear andwheredoubtful. Nothing could, I think, be concealed from me, and yet, with all thisknowledge, and notwithstanding his conviction, I conclude, as Wiliam Palmer's brilliant advocate did, by the declara tion of the solemn belief in his entiro innocence. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. N?TO. SMITH. C. N1EWTON, .Rlageley, June 4. .tSacon's liotel, June o. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME S. Sir,-I notice in your paper of Saturday last the publica.- tion of a resolution of the Coroners' Society, proposed by Mr. R. Benridge, coroner for Devonshire, censuring my conduct on the occasion of holding the inquest on the body of John Parsons Cook. I am not a memnber of that society, and I mnst say I donot thlink such a resolution would have been passed had they been Uin possession of the whole facts, and more particularly had that society been aware that I shall shortly have an opportunity of vindicating my conduct in referenceto the Rugeley inquests before the Lord Chancellor, and smtil then .L trust the pubEic will reserve their opinion and not be biased by any pubEication founded on a onesided statemnent. As you have published the resolution be hind enough toinsert this communication. I am. Sir. vonrs obediently. I Stafford, June 3. WYL WEBB WAID, Coroner. TO THE EDITOR OF T IM, IES. Sir,-I find in your paper of this dayapamgraph relating to me, which contains many inaccuracies whiclr I feel it necessary to contradict. I was called upon by the solicitor for Tawell to make some experiments to elucidate the case, and was also in court to watch the chymical evidence for the yrosecution, in company with Professor Graham aud Dr. Letheby. I was satisfied that what was produced in court was evidence of the existence of prussic acid ihi the stomach of the deceased, and told Sir E. Kelly so. I left Berkhampstead before the defence was commenced- consequently, I was not a witness for the defence at all. Idid not wait upon the Home Secretary, nor did I interfere in any way after I left the court, being fully convinced of Tawell's guilt. With respect to my opinion regarding Palmer's case, I learnt on my return here that dr. Yates had visited Bristol with ananonymous letter in his hand (since acknowledgedto. be written by Mr. Simmons, magistrate's clerk, Keynsham), and questioned many gentlemen whom I am in the habit of meeting as to whether they had hard me say "that I hwd no doubt that strychnia was in Cook's body, but that Dr. Taylor could not find it ;" and "that a word from nie woLids haag the man" (Palmer). Tney all stated that they had heard me speak of the case, but not in such terms.. The Mayor said that " he could not say the exact words, but the impression on his mind was, that I thought there was strychnia there, but that Dr. Taylor could not find it." Far too much importance has been attached to my words on these occasions, even by the judge, as they. weret not an opinion given upon legal evidence, but my impres sion fromn-uwspaper reports,Nvith their exaggerations, imme. diately after the inquest, and before I had heard both sides. It was not right that I should have been asked a question upon it, as it was not evidence of my opinion, after having heard all the witnesses for the defence as well as tho altered evidence for the prosecution. It is not for me to express an opinion now; the jry have convicted him; but I cannot refrain from saying that it is from circumstantia evidence alone-strong, it is true, but, in the absence of finding the poison in ihe body, there is no direct proof, and theman may yet be innocent of the murder. I cannot conclude this letter without noticing two very erroneons oPmions, of most mischievons tendency, which have been c.rculated during the inquiries. The first is, that strychnia cannot he fonnd in the body after a very limited time; that it is absorbed and decomposed in the system. This is a mere assumption, foanded on no experiment but failin" ones; whereas I have so found it after two months" and.uso separated it unaltered from the blood, the liver, and the urine. Strychnia is so permanent that even concentrated sulphuric acid does not alter it. The second is, that prussic acid cannot be found after 14 days. This is also incorrect. I have detected it in a body after it had been buried two mnonths. Ihope, therefore, thatthe piblic uill now be satisfied that they cannot be despatched by either of these two poisons wthout their being detected. I remain. Sir. Tours. &c.. -- - - -- - -W"LLIAM XEErAiPATHE. oanaUn-Joume, WIU-pan, Dr]sao, oune % TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIlES. - Sir,-It has been stated in a London paper, wdch somis to me to be engaged in the defence of ]?almer, that I h&ve not been seen at Rugeley sincethe trial, insinuating, in fwct, that I dare not make my appearance there-n as3ertion which is calculated to do me much nury.
