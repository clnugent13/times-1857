The lettersfrom Holland mention that the whole of the 850,00O. of silver, bought of the Bank of Amsterdam about a month back iby London firms, was sent to Vienna. The price at which it was sold ranged betwIeen 105f. 60c. and 105f. 70c., but the Bank have now raised their terms, and have fixed their selling price for fine silver at 105f. 80c., and their purchasing price at 104f. 65c. Another step in the ureparations for establishing a submarine teiegraph between America and. Europe aas just been completed. - A month back the New York, Newfoundland, and. London Telegraph Company, by whom the enterprise is undertaken, sucvceeded in laying down a cable, manufactured by Ruper andCo.,of London,fromthe northern pointof 7Yova Scotia to Cape IRay, Newfoundland, a distance f 85 miles, and. this will be extended across Newfoundland to St. John's Bay, whence the ocean disanuce to the west coast of Ireland is 1,6404 miles. 3deanwhile the small steamer Arct.ic was despatched by the United States' Government, under the comfnand of Captain 0. H. Berryman, to me soundin3gs between these two points. She left Newfoundland on the 31st of July, and was not expected on ;this aide until the first week inl September, but her .nrrival at Queenstown, Cork, took place on Saturday, and she is said to have performed satisfactorily te object of her voyage. The accounts from the manufacturing towns .for the past week show little alteration, butthe general tone is satisfactory, the home demand being everyvhereactive, while the orders from the United States and Canada are in most cases good. At Manchester the market opened with an improvement, but it was mot maintained to the end of the week. The Birmingham advices describe some partial tendency to a revival inthe manufactured iron trade. At Nottingham there hasbeen an increased business with full lansactions for the United States. In the woollen districts there has been much steadiness, and the Irish linen markets continue active, with a tend&Lcy to higher prices. *At a special meeting of the General Screw Steam 'Company to-day, Mr. Raikes Currie in the chair, a resolution was passed authorizing a dissolution. A ballot is necessary to ascertain the opinion of the proprietors, as the votes of two-thirds are required for a final decision. At the close of the proceedings this afternoon the ballot was opened, and it will be -continued until to-morrow at 12 o'clock, when the result will be announced. In answer to questions, it was stated that the forfeiture of the deposit paid by the French ClipperCompanyhas arisen from their inability to complete the contract oriinally entered into. An endeavour was made to gain an extension of time to carry out the proposed arrangement, and the directors of the General Screw were anxious, if possible, to accomplish this object. They therefore suggested the payment of a further moderate deposit, but the French company did not avail themselves of the offer. With regard to a subsequent proposal from other parties for the employment of the fleet for a period of two years, the terms -may be called remunerative, but the directors heave not, under the cirumstances, considered it advisable to agree to them. Respecting a sale of the vessels, it was contended that the advertisement put forward for the purpose is. calculated to create a prejudicial influence, as it states that if their disposal cannot be arianged by private contract in a specified time they will be brought to public auction. In reply, the chairman explained that, in making the announcement, the board were anxious to prove the sincerity of their intention to wind up the company. Several shareholders, while expressing confidence in the policy of the board, then urged that it would bo desirable to exhaust every available means for a sale by prlvate contract before adopting the medium of auction; and. a resolution to that effect was supported by the directors, and unanimously agreed to. -The dividends on the Cuba Loans of 1834 and 1837 have been advertised for payment. The particulars of bonds drawn under the operation of the sinking fund have also been published. The new steamer Chersonese, of 2,300 tons, sailed <>n7 Saturday from Liverpool for St. John's, NewfoundLand, being the first of a new line established to run between Liverpool, Newfoundland, THalifax, and. Portland-in-Maine. The Sir James Brooke iron screw steaner, of 550 tons, belonging to the Borneo Company, left London to-day for Sarawak, calling7 at Singapore, between which places she is intended to keep open a ,permanent communication. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised seven vessels-three to Adelaide, two to Sydney, one to Port Phillip, and one to Hiobart Town, with an aggregate capacity of 5,026 tons. The rates of freight exhibit no material ariation. In the general business of the port of Iondon ,during the past week there has been little change. 'The total of vessels reported inward from foreign parts was 291, being 9 less than inthe previous week, and the number cleared outward was 140, including 25 in ballast, showing a decrease of 22. The number of ships on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 78, being 6 more than the last account. Of those now loading 1O are for Adelaide, 3 for Auckland, 1 for Canterbury, 7 for Geelong, 5 for Hobart Town, 2 for Launceston, 2 for Melbourne, 2Eor Moreton Bay, 4 for New Zealand, 19 for Port Phillip, 3 for PortlandBay, 15 for Sydney, 3 for Swan River, 1 for Wellington, and 1 for 'Wa;rruambool. for The settlement in the guaranteed shares of the 3Ietropolitan Eailway is fixed for the 4th of Sep*tember1 but they arenot to be marked as guaranteed a-hares in the offecia st. -The colonial wool sales, which commenced on the 17th of July, terminated to-day. They compriea 3q6,746 bales, andl opened at an average decline of between ld. and 1I per lb. In the course of a 1oitaighut a rally commenced, and former prices were -ultiately regained. The following remarks on the aides are2 from Mr. W. H. WVillans | 'The pablic sales of colonial and other wools which ternilasted to-day comprisd-From Vietor, 26,728 bales; Â£rom Sydney and Sloreton Bay, 23,950; f-om Tasmania, 8,073; from South Austilia, 1O,010 - from New Zealand 3,429; from Swan mver, 837; andthe Cape of Good Hope, ;6,359; making 79,386 bales oC colonial- besides Indin, 4,922 bale-3 and sundriee, 3,135; which brought the aggre,vato to 86,746 bales. The extent and 'Inportauce of these sales attracted a large attendance both of hoMe and foreign. buyers. The latter, however, have not taken their usuaL proportion which may, perhaps, be attibuted to 'he fact that they La! supplied themselves freely at the recent fair3 in Germany- and elsewhere. Previous to the commence_ ment oninions were divided as to the result. It was gene. rally k6rwn that the stcmks in thp hands of the Yorkshire dealers were larger than msual at this season, and it was presumaed tht the unauccensu ful results of their proviou3 purchases would indispose them to operate freely unless at a very decided reduiction. The stoclk of wool, however, in the bands of manufactuz2re were unusually small-indeed, they may be said to bave been absolutely exhausted, and -this circumstanoe, coupled with the smallness of the stocks-of manufactured goods, and the general soundness of the woollen trade, inclined mny to the opinion that prices wovud.no' on the average exhibit any material reduction.

THE CORB TPlDE. MARK-LAWE, Mosw,Ay AXFMNOOB, AUG. 2.. ISngh-hi supplies have continued limited, but foreigr, abundant, excepting in beans and peas. Tho weekYs exports were 730 quarters wheat, 50 quarters oats, 70 quarters peas, 1,488 quarters maize, and 940 sacks flour. The home-g!own wheat supply was 4,000, and with the help of 20,000 Russian the foreign was 31,237 quarters. The show of samples this morning from Kent and Essex was moderate, and consisted principally of new, of fair quality, some white weigh. ing over 631b. per busheL The weather being some-what modified, though threatening, with a declining barometer, sales were scarcely so brisk as on Friday, at 2s. to 3s. advance on both old and new qnalities. More inquiry was found for foreign, at a similar advance, which was exceeded for Russian descriptions. Of country flour there were 9,267 sacks, of American 5,375 barrels, with 300 sacks from St. Petersburg. Though millers did not raise the price of town flour, Norfolks were held at 53s. to 54s. per sack, and barrels were fully ls. dearer. Of barley there were 7,079 quarters foreign, with 663 quarters British. Full prices were made for malting !amples and all foreign sorts. Malt sold without brislmess, atunaltered rates. Of foreign oats thsere were 54,319 quarters (nearly 39,000 from Rusia), vith 970 quarters from Ireland, and only 367 quarters English per rai. Theabundadiceof Russian ep't this description from an advance; but othei kinds, especialy stout and heavy samples, were improved 6d. to Is. per quarter. Of beans there were only 313 quarters, exclusively Pnglish. Of peas only 155 quarters, including a cotchel of foreign. Both these pulse fully maintained former iates generally, but white peas were rather easier. The linseed supply was 5,705 quarters, with exports 950 quarters. No change in prices could be noted, but the article was firm, with more inquiry for cakes. Some new white mustard has appeared, with high prices aske, but riot iven. Canary hardly- sold so welL.

Beyond clerical. circles .tho meetings did not attract much. interest. In addition -to a flarge bodya of 'clergymen belon to the city and ~neighbourhoodthere were-present-the Hon. and Rev B.ptist Noel, theRev Dr. }Rrommacher,'of Berlin-; ,the Rcv, ames Sherman, Of London ;the Rev.

There ws also -a large body of laymen fro'm a dsanschne.- The meetingDs weregenerally occupied in listening to addr uport of missionary entprise and (hristian At the meeting on Wednesday the Rev. J. P. Dobson the secretary of the Alliance, read the annuadl ret, which deteiled at great lengh the severalmneetings whic a hd been held forprayer an Christn fellowship during the year. They noticed with ragrettthe 'perversions to Popery which 3ad taken pace of persons connected with Scotland during the year-such as the Marchioness of Lothian, the Duchess of Buccieuch, and lMr. Hope Scott, and the zeal whichlwas shown to develo' the errors of Popery or Puseyite episcopay among the leading re'identfamilies in certain districts. The council aLo reported the. successful efforts they had made, in conjunction with others, to stop the Sunday bands in London, and toprovent the opening of the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the CrystalPalace on Sunday. The council reported that they had received an extraordinary communication from the 'Xing of 1ru, conveying IHi Majestys cordial silutation-to the councill, stating that he gave his testimony to4the Alliance-with an entire conviction, exrpressin(> his hope that it mighlt hear happy fruits for all the EvangeE!cal churches, and signifing his approval of a project for an- assembly of Christians-of all ations.at Berlin. In consequence a deputation, conslaingm of the Rev. Dr. Steine, lEr. John Finch, and Xd. Valette, of Paris, had proceeded to 3erEn to pave the way. Dr. STErxs at a subsequent diet; detiled the reception which the deputation received from the King of Prsa, 'which was in the highest degree flattering and favourable. Atthe meeting yesterday, The Rev. Dr. BLaCnaVOOD gave some interesting statements regarding the s.ate and prospects of Christianikt in the East. He said, his object was to throw out some practical suggestions for teaching Christianity to the soldiers of the British amy and to the people of Turkey. He had arrived at the conclusion that this nlliance had now felt its wat, and was still feeling itsvway to a greater extent, so that they -were now in a position to take pracetical stens for smnistering to the spiritual destitution of their fellow-men. Her had gone to the East as amilitary chzplain, and if he had not obtained that appointment his usefulsiess in the field which he wished to occupy would have been greatly impaired. 'No picture could reveal the intense sufferings which took place, in the army hospitals in the East, in which thousands of men were dsing daily without any spiritual instruction. In the great nospital of Scutari, to which he was attached, there were 3,000 men confined by sickness, none of v;homi they might ever expecttosee again. In the long corridors they had but littlespace to ministertothesufferingand dying. At one time he had from S10 to 1,000 men under his care, none of w hom had the most remote expectation of ever recovering their health. While this awful destitution prevailed, and dangers occurred in these hospitals which were as great as in the trenches, appeals to England to get men to go out were in vain. Eventualy some did go out. When walking, in themorning,throughoneoEthe wards en awinter day, he found 40 new patients brought intoa half-finished corridor. He went around them all, and ascertained to what denomination they belonged, to all of whom he either gave a Testament or a tract, and prayed with them. He returned in the morning, and foundthatoutof39 20hadpassed into eternity.- There, was an immense amount of spiritual destitution in the army. The only instruction theyreceived-at. least those that could be spared being on the Sunday morning at parade ground-was while theywere standing on their feet. The whole means for supplying. spiritual instruction to the British soldier were most deplorably defective. - He had nothing to - say against .ho chaplains of the army, hut the 'vh6le system of their appointment 'was defective. Among the soldiers and officers there were many men of Goed, more particularly among the artileSry and fengineesrs-men whose hearts were burning> with love to add anything. they could to the spiritulal condition of their fellowv soldiers. He went out on the under-~ standing that he was to minister to none but those of the Protestant faith. The Presbyterians, who came out later in the war, found great difficulty in finding but a strayPresbyterian here and theres; but he was not so much tied down, for he ministered to all except Rmoman Catholics, yet even for those he had always a kindly word or a shake of the hand. He had freqiently been asked by a Roman Catholic priest, if he found a Protestant in his ward, to go in and minister to him; indeed, Roman Catholic priests often went out to seek for him to go in and pray with Protestants. Captain Hedley Vicars, -who had fallen in a Rusnian sortie, was much asked after by soldiers in hospital. He was led to inquire why so mnuch interest was evinced on behalf of that officer, when he found that he had been in the habit of calling on: his men of the 97th, in tents and elsewhere, when he-'rayed with them. Many of these poor men had assured ham that the first light of God's Word which they ever received was from the lips of Captain Vicars, that martyred mah of God. General orders from head.quartera prohibited the chaplains from employing any cle men but those sanctioned by. the War Department. Now, he 'thought the council of the Evangelical Alliance should seek out men of God who were in possession of Christian-love, so that, 'wherever they might be -cist, there would always be a little' nucleus of evangelical soldiers ready ,to call together their friends, Hs next proposition was to form a miiitay alliance for this oblect. He was not sure whether this was so practicable as the first suggestion, but,this he knew, that there'were many soldiers who would willingly join with them. There might, indeed, .be a specific alliancd formed for this verv purose. If it was harrowing to the feelhngs tose men laid low on a bed of sickness, with thei Simsrotting from them, how much more so was it to witness the spiritual and moral destitution 'which prevailed among the soldiers' wives who had accompanied their husbands from this nation? in the march from Bslgaria to Varna they were left destitute and helpless, and under those trials they had first takento drink; and nltimiantely their mora character gave way altogether.' So full were the hands of Miss Nightingale that she couid pay no attention to these women; and he, with others, took them under his notice. In one room ho found o7 women lying among men and children, with but scanty clothing to cover them, and nothing to separate one sex: from theoether, unleoss it mighLt be a rag hung uXpon a.llne, which was only an apology for a separation. Heo brought those facts before the meeting' as he hoped to enlist the sympathies of the ladies in the amelioration of the soldier, by ameliorating the condition of the soldier's wife. The best soldier they had was the married zoldier. Colonel lefroyhad said that no amelioration could -be extended to the soldier's v.ife on account of the expnso necessaryfor baramck accommodation; but he had told him that the British people would not shrink from prof.ding for the comfort of the soldiers' wives, and he thoughttho ladies of that alliance smight do much good in this matter. by forming themselves into small committees for the advancement of the cause. The rev. doctor then referred to the alliance in the East. He said that wherever he found really Christian men he never found any difficulty in forming an evangelical alliance, so that it was quite easy for ther to form an alliance in Constantinople for the protection of Protestants in Turkey. The Mahomedanreligion was the religion of the eountry, but other churches were tolerated, sabject to the control of the Porte and its Ministers. He explained the position oEChristianity inTurkey. Theywere aware that nominally-at least on paper-every person in Turkey could follow what system of religion, he thought 'rght, -and they thought that was also applticable to nativehorn Musitilmans; but they were not to' believe that this sate of matters 'would 'ce carried out in its en' tirety. After alluding to the depnatuon which had proceeded to Turkey-among*hich he found a number for the Presentation of a request to the Sultan that relgious freesom should be accorded to every man in Turkey, and also to 3fahomedans, should they become Christians. which led to thepRublication of is fbrmanaunnouncing thin freedom of religion-he referred to the hardship which the Protestants of urkfy endured. *Much sufferinghad'been undergonoeby the Protestants in Brouss and Smyrna. What he had to suggest was, that the council should take into their consiheration 'to things-viz., to appo-nt nd ray a core:pondent a't Constantin'ople'to remit to london all details of the sufferings . which exist, and make that liberty real which existed now only on paper; and also to enable these parties 'to paY deputations to the Sultan, to represent thesr cases, 'wlhch wier mainly occaeioned by the chicanery of the infamous 'and ungodly Ministers of the Porte, Hreferretothe badcondition of the Turkish Scriptsree, and urged that an iffort be .mide't provido them !vitha e_gnuin7 copy of te' Bible.a The -present kansltionwras not worth re-Drinting. 'If they got a good0 transation, he tristed that, miderGod,the printing wouldbe carried out. He.suggested that'the council'should take cognizance of this' I *orL-, and appoint a committee to confer with the Britislh iandForeigsr-BibleSociety; As he hadreceived books and 'tractS in evesyangtaage from England, from privatefanilies 7and societies, whieh had distributed in Turkey, to"whnm 'hehad'neverbeenin apbsitiontowriteaword of.thanks, bhe now took tie liberty of doing so.' The rev. doctec proceeded to 'remark on the subject of missions, and said ithat the more missions were extended at home the grcater'would be' the reflex from abroad.IHe thought the 'alliance shouldtske some steps to rech the Bulgarians and Mahomedans, 'H7e sawr no obstacle to it- himlself, and he hoped the council 'wold take the matter intO theiroseroios consideration. 'He :conclndedIhs"address by statingtIat'it wasaproperconEideration for them, in the exercise of that forbearance and brotherly love which ought to Aaimoate Christians, not to interfere in missionary fields . previously occupied by other missionaries.' The concludingn meeting of the session was held in the City-hall in the evening; the Hon. Lord Benholme in th chair. :''" " - ' : The Rev.. Sir H. XocacnnMT. in the 'course of a practical' speech, said that the way to make the alliance of servica was to-make it enPge in practical operations.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having read with atention the admirable speech of Lord Stanley at the National Reformatory Union, of which, in regard to its special purpose, no praise can be teta high, I am induced to call your attention to a sma1l portion of it which bears npon another very important subject. On this subject the opinion of Mhe imes has more than once been most usefully pronounced. 7 - Spea3dng of those who are peculiarly the object of re-. f6rmatory treatment, his Lordship adverts to a "class, met 'with both among adults and young persons, in whom the,tendency to commit criminal acts appears to arise rather out of a morbid action of the mind than out of any external uimpelling causes. Even in these less hopeful cases, the morbid tendency often appears to be connectod with the physical organization ," and lie ads, " a grea' deal might. le said toucling the -connerion of some forms of crimirnality with iunnoticed cerebral disease." I venture to estismxte these Iwo passages3 in their ilation to criminal juris-, .prudence; and inthe latter one I readily express my entira agreement w ith his Lo rdsip, as well as a belief that this exculpatory circumstance is in the present day always duly appreciatedL The frst remarek-viz., that the tendency to commit criminall acts appears, in a certainL las, to arise rather out of amorbidaction of the mindthanoLt of any external impelling cause " also involves a gre&t3 truth. But why tho epithet "morbid l" It is nmque3. tionably a law of vicious tendencies and principles oE action that, at the moment at which they are carried into effect, their intensity is quite disproportionate to the c,ternal impelling cause. With respect to the counexion of theaso-c31ed morbid tendency with physical organiation, there is not a passing -thought, or feeling, or tendency oE 'which that cannot be predicated, so intimate is theunion oE mind and matter. Iet the word ",morbid" be introduced' inWo statementseof tho above Idnd, and imamediately a train ofissociations is suggested, such as, in the present state or mphilosophical, thought on the subject, led, s few months ago, to the very mischievous exculpation oE Corrigan, the wife murderer, and Ceestina Sommers, tha childayer. Vice is not less normal, not less a part of humannature, than virtue. It is the legItimato subject or treatment and prevention to the Beformatory Union, and they must not, without stronger reason than the abova quoted passage affords, and it over to the medical facuity. I am, Sir, your obedient sarvant. T. M.: '. Aug. 23.
ZONDON, TZESDAY, AUGOU.T 26, 18:A- *E paxiy clique ancd locality has, of course, its own internal politics aparb from those which it proc'a ms in the face of the nation. Each borough h. its distinguUdchaiCActers, who Lr6 iunknown beyond its limits; each- cst has its celebrities of piety or- oratory, whom, the 'world at lr,ge persists in ignoring. The di8cusaions of the n.urovincial press, their rivalrie' and invectives, axe unheeded beyond their respective districts, though loud and violent enough within their own area.. The minor spheres of debate are quite independent of the great course of national politics, but it is as well now and then to tun to them,' that -we may Bee what subjects are thought worth dispute and argumentwhile the -world advanceiiunheeding on its way. The Conservative party, as represented by its newspapers, is engaged in a discsion which the public in general will care for as little ss the war about a paving-rate, or a new pump in a provincial market-town. Yef, in appearance) it is certainly a grand question. Is there a Conservative party? What are the principles of Conservatism, and what does it propose to conserve? Such is the subject which in this dull and dreary recess engages the faculties of the Tory press. Ten, or even four years since, how anxiously the nation listened to the definitions of a "1true - Conservative policy !" It was to protect agriculture, to uphold Protestantisni, to rescue British industry orom the foreigner, to stem the current of democracy. 'Now nine-tenths of England are hardly aware that the Country Party is debating whether or not their leaders have betrayed them, nay, whether there exists an entity which is capable of being betrayed. So far have all that Lord DEnBy and MIr. DIsRAELI represented passed away from the thoughts of the nation, that the debates of the few who hold to them. are now no more matter of importance than a vestry squabble or an arclusological discussion. The course of the last session has been more than disheartening to those who cling to the old cries and watchwvords of 1852. It cannot be said that the House of Commons rejects the Conservative doctrines, because there is really nothing to reject. The Tories are not only without a policy, but without an intelligible creed. For a party of men to act together and seek office with no other bond of union than having once held in comramon certain exploded notions on finance and politics is felt to be impossible. As little can they find any cohesion in the enunciation of political platitudes to which any member of the House could equally subscribe. Mr. DisT&mm and his followers are determined to support the Constitution, to take no steps against the Church, 'to resist cnange except where it can be proved to be positively advantageous, to k-eep our military and naval establishments in an effective state, yet with. a proper regard to general economy, to uphold the agricultural and manufacturing interests of the country in harmony with each other, as equally necessry to the welfare of this great nation. To truisms like these do the Conservative leaders confine themselves at the present day, and it cannot be wondered that such vague generalities fail to gain adherents, or even to avert suspicion among former followers. All who have borne the burden of party warfare for so many years, the faithful squires and rectors and farmers, must be, no doubt, sorely discouraged at the trumpet giving such an uncertain sound. Their Liberal friends will also tell them what they themselves cannot but begin to feel-that they have no hope from a party success. Let them register and canvass, and speak and write, so as at the next general election to send a Conservative majority to Parliament, and raise their steadfastly followed leaders to power. What will be the result ? A few cheering expressions in a Ministerial address about the Throne, and Protestantisn, and British interests, and then all the new Secretaries and Privy Councillors will go to work to keep themselves in office by becoming more ostentationsly liberal than the Liberals themselves. All that they have opposed for years they will hurriedly and without an apology adopt; all on which they have pertinaciously insisted theywill give up, with the ready excuse that circumstances have changed, or the time has come for a reconsideration of former views. We cannot wonder that, with these things patent to the world, we should have Tory newspapers lamenting "the present weakened and distracted state of the "Conservative party., As far as we can understand the reasoning of this portion of the press, the first difficulty is to prove the existence of a Conservative party at all. This is indeed a very elaborate inductive proceES. Conservative doctrines must evidently be such as are held by Conservatives, and not by Liberals. But no specific article of faith can be found which is not equally shared in by three-fourths of the Liberals in the Idngdom. It is therefore necessary to abandon this ground. It is next urged that Conservative doctrines are such as all Conservatives hold. But then itis proved that there are Conservatives, not to be disowned by the party, who openly in their speeches repudiate everything which is a distinctive badge of Lord DaRay's followers, and rush into extremes of liberality from which moderate Whigs would shrink. If the present Government be Liberals, -what are men of the opinions of Lord Srhsxy? If he be a Conservative,vwhat can we call the colleagues of Lord PATZiERSTON ? It is therefore necessary once more to change ground, and the existence of a Conservative party is demonstrated somewhat on the principle, CogiUo, ergo sum. There is a party in office which is called ILiberal. There is also another Earty in opposition. To oppose the Liberals must be Conservative. Therefore the present Opposition forms a Conservative party. The fact that such a discussion should take place among the organs of the party, while its leaders are silent and the public uninterested, plainly shows how iar the body of politicians led by iord DannBy and Mr. Disnanr have fallen in the national esteem. They represent nothing, and are nothing, except a cerain number of voters in either Eouse, who can obstract and embarras, but seem powerless to lead or originate. What. reality there is in their creed may be leaint from the fact that -they are still debating about the character of Sir ROBsBT ?xr_i and the morality of his acts in 1829 and 1846. What discipline there is in their forces may be judged from the contradictions of their leading politicians and the dissensions of their few remaining organs in the press; what policy in their- tactics is evinced by such an. onslaught as the motioni on Kars, hich resulted in one-half the party violently combating the arguments of the other half, and giving the Ministry a majority unequalled in these days of weak Governments and independent opinions. But 'we would not see the Conservative party totally extinct. Indeed, it is to be regretted that its perversity and the insincerity of its leaders have so lowered its position. A set of politicians are in sad case when the word " Opposition!' is the only generic term which embraces them. New combinations will, no- doubt, take away many Imembers from the Conservative ranks, and perhaps reinforce them with one or two who are now st;yled Liberals. Bit, whatever may be in the future, it is plain that. the party must have a' principle and a policy before it can again become powerful and respected. Let Lord DERBy and his followers mak;e up their miinds to do something, to. state some decided opinions, and take- in hand the achievement of some definite object, instead of' wearying the public by maintaning a mere obetructi,ve attitude, and enunciating from ti1e to tiiae vague and insincere generalities. I
While the natioi is so heartily bending itself to the task of reforning those of'ita priminals who are capable of. reformation, it cannot afford to forget the duty of detecting and prosecuting crime. 'There is danger in all reactions, alld just now there. seems to be setting in a reaction against the penal character of. prosecutions. But, withou't entering on the comparative anatomy of the penal and reformatory systems, -it is wise to remember that neither- can have its due effect unless, in the first instance, the commission of crime be follo-wed by speedy detection and judicial investigation; and it is- the intereat of every community to organize the most effectual machinery it can command for the discovery of those members who have been casually or habitually engaged- in breaking its laws and damaging its interasts. You maust catch your crminal before you can either punish or reform him. We have stated our opinion to be in favour of public prosecutors. Mr. GREAVES, in the able Parliamentary paper to vihich we have aready referred, opposes their institution, but we cannot help thinking thafhis objection is one of phrases rather than substance. Wlhatever be the ultimate form of the institution adopt, we trust that -it will be niore stamped vith official authority and publicity than the present system; and, whether one officer or more be invested with the duties of public prosecution-whether a prosecutor be appointea for a district or for a county-we hope that something will be done to insure the-ttentiou of one directing mind for the conduct of criminal prosecutions within such an area as would not overtax the energies of one person. At present the A?rosuNzy-G&asMAL is nominaLly the public prosecutor for all England, and it would be absurd to suppose that he can be more than nominaUy so. It is only fircases of more than ordinary moment that he can be expected personally to take part as the State prosecutor of offenders, But in many cases where he cannot attend in court he can and does .give the Gxovernment the benefit of lis advice. It is the fault of the present system that he does not do so, either personally or by deputy, in all cases. As it is, and as Mir. GnBxvzs illustrates by some striking examples, it is too often a matter of chance, compromise, collusion, indifference, or zeal, whether a heinous crime is brought to the cognizance of a Court or not. This should not be so. The most fatal encouragement to crime is the uncertainty of its detection. Eradicate from your criminal population the belief that they have a large percentage of chances in favour of impunity, and you will strike at the root of their profession. Do not leave it to ignorance, or laziness, or corruption, or self-interest, to decide whether any investigation shall or shall not be made into the circumstances of suspected murder or deliberate outrage. Itemove from the injured those impediments to public justice which the necessity of encountering great trouble or great expense now imposes upon them. Do this by some process whieh may bring criminal prosecutions more under the immediate direction of the Sovereign power than they hitherto have been. Mr. GRnAvxs suggests several objections to the establishment either of distriet attorneys, such as are employed in some of the American States, or of public prosecutors, such as are recommended by the recent committee. He objects, first, that where an attorney selected by the prosecutor has properly prepared the case, there is no excuse for retaining a public attorney or prosecutor. But the very facts which Mr. GBxAvES has already mentioned, and which we have quoted, lead to the conclusion that there are many cases which, are not properly prepared by the attorneys; and 'that-, to insure a successful trial, many indictments should either have been put into the hands of some publie prosecutor, to advise on and carry through, &c., or should have -been submitted to some experienced and recoganized official attorney, before handing them over to counsel. In howv many cases is not evidence imperfectly collected or improperly acted on? Mr. GREAVES next starts the objection that at present prosecutions are conducted by the rising men on every circuit, who look to this kind of business as the most favourable introduction to professional employment, and therefore devote themselves sedulously toit; whereas a public prosecutor would probably be a fixture, hopeless of promotion and heedless of his duties. We cannot admit this objection to be valid. Supposing a public prosecutor to be appointed for every district, his duty would be to exercise- a general superintendeuce over prosecutions, to decide which of them should be brought into court, what evidence should be offered, &c. The most important of these he would himself conduct in person, but a great number his want of ubiquity or of strength, and the concurrent action of two Courts, would compel him to delegate to other members of the bar, who would find the same area and feel the same stimulus for exertion as they do under the present system. Nor do we believe that the public prosecutor himself would necessarily be lulled into careless lethargy by the nature of his duties. If not already the leader of his sessions, he would in most cases be a man very near tne lead.; he would be in the prime of life ; he wouldfeel the ordiuary incentives which inspire a man who has already attained a certain point in his career ; and he would naturally wish to advance in the good opinion of the public. Every man at the bar engaged in criminal cases looks forward to civil business, and there are certain kinds of civil business which are best conducted by a man who has been successful in managing criminal prosecutions. The third objection which Dr. GEA.vEs starts,-viz., that firsrate counsel would never accept the office,-seems equally futile. What is meant by " first-rate I' If a man were generally employed who possessed the- verage-talentu&experience of even the second-das practitioners at assizes and sessions it would be sufficient; and the faculty:of retaining the assistace of first-rate men when necessary would be as open to the pros6cuting as the defending party. Neither do we see howa the appointment of such an officer would tend to discourage the study -of the- criminal law. If to the office Were attached aji adequate -emolument we may rest assured that it 'would. attract the attention of the most experienced aspirants on thecircuit; and it is not necessary to presuppose a large amount of salary. The opportunity of distinction and the prospect of civil business which it 'would open to any man wsho brought industry, experience, and skdll to bear upon the performance of its duties, would constitute half of its rewards, and we are inclined to thinik that the public would gain, were the appointment regarded by professional men rather as a stepping-ztone to future promotion than as -a esting-place for life. Look0ing, then, to th competition w .hich there would be 'or such an appointment, no less than the competition which it would excite among those desirous of a-sisting in the conduct of prosecu- tions,-looking also to t'he practice which prevails in Scotland and in our own colonies, and alo (on: certain occasions) in our Central Crimnimal Courtwe think that the bar would not siuffer, nnd the public woula gain vastly, by the public prose- cution of ofenders. It may, indeed, be that it is not so muchl an: offlcer to undertake prosecutions in court that is wanted as one to plan and prepare them for the hands of counsel. We 9urseives. agree * lrth MxE.'x.vxEs in thinkting thit it~iz:the direction .of some superintendinigintelligence which is msbt required for the selection and arrangement of cases. Whether the ame' officer shouldz give his opinion on, charges brought before the trates or arising from 'coroners' .mqueets, and afterwards bring- them :(personally or with 'the assistance of others) before the Judge at assizes, er whethOr an attorney should be appoited for their prelinary management, with the option of retaining 3ny oounsel he chose, is a question of detail, which can best be decided by two or three of our best criminal Sudges and two or three of our best Chairmen of Quarter Sessions. Mr. GBArVEs seemstof ndfault with both suggestions; but his own statement.of existing evils iS, quite sufficient to prove that one. or other of them must be adopted, unle we wish to leave the prosecution of crime in remote districts entirely- to the caprice of a busy attorney or the judggment of aii energetic but illiterate police. man.
ln the town of Bolton there are three very evil icustoms. The first custom is, that husbands 'get |Idrunk; the second, that wives administer to them when in this state, without their knowledge, powders of tartarized antiuony ; the third, that hybrid druggists-that ' is, shopkeepers, half druggists, half grocers-sell theso powders to all applieants under the name of "q tidumes." In other-words, the husband gets drunk, the druggist sells poison, the wife purchases it, and slays her husband. Now, it wo-ald be far too m3uch to say that under ordinary circumstances the wife deliberately intends to taL-e her husband's life. Brutal I ignorance and the force of example have far more to do with this result than malignity and set purpose. The consequencea are not the Iess fatal. " Quietness" is secured at the price of existence. The drunken fit of life is over, and the wretched man sleeps peaeefully at last in his uiihonoured grave. Now, this is a very terxible state of things. It is right that drunkards shouldbe reformed, but it is wrong that wives should be empowered to award against them the sentence of death as a punishment for their offence. It is a great reproach against our police regulations that such a thing is possible as the purchas- of drugs which can destroy life, even when administered in serial doses. The slibject, no doubt, including, as it does, the whole chapter of quack medicines, is encompassed with difficulties ; but these arenot of a nature which might not readilybe overcome wVith.a little attention and determination. Probably, the best resource in the existing state of the law would be to put it stringently in force against the vendor of poisonous drugs. " I think it right to state," said Mr. JusticeWixs on Saturday at Lverpool, "that "if any persons engaged in the sale of drugs "choose to sell to married women poisonous druag "without the knowledge of their husbands, and "well knowing that they are intended to be "administered to their husbands, no matter for "what purpose, and death ensues, all persons so "acting are equally guilty of manslaughter." It is almost superfluous to state that the criminal liability of the druggist is not in any degree affected by the conjugal position of the parties. Whether the poison be sold to vife or husband, father or mother, daughter or son, to A or to B, mnatters not, under the conditions expressed by the learned Judge; the vendor of the poison is liable to indictment. We should not be sorry to see the effect of one exhibited on the druggist who figured in the case tried on Friday and Saturday of last week at Liverpool. The case, in brief, stood somewhat as follows:- BETsy ArNMluLAr was indicted for the wilful murder of DANMEL ?&VMUra, her husband, at Bolton, by poisoning him witn small doses of antimony. The deceased was a flourdealer. He and his wife appear .to have lived on very bad terms. They viere both drunl-ards, and, if the glimpse we get at the interior of their household may be accepted as true for other establishmnents of the same kind, the family arrangements of petty tradesmen in our provincial towns are not in a very satisfactory condition. Sometimes the husband was drank-sometimes the wife, but when the husband was drunk the fit was usually of three days' duration. Other causes, however, appear to have been at work besides drunken frenzy. The husband, strange as it may appear, was jealous of his wife, and some man, who in the proceedings is called "PrETrm," disturbed his tranquillity in the intervals of his drunken fits. This being the state of things, BxrTsY ArMuLLAn went to the shop of a druggist at Bolton called Srersox, and askled for some "quietness," or " quietners ;" the terms appear to be indifferently used. "QuietCC ness" means a powder of antimony and cream of tartar. It is sold at Bolton for the purpose of- being given to drunken men. It makes them siclk, and induces great prostration of strength. "The powders," said Ir. SzaPsoif, the druggist, "are used by factory operatives to "clear cotton from their stomachs. I don't re"member ever to have seen a man come for these "powders. We alwsys tell purchasers to divide "each powder into four doses. We sell about five "every week." The fact is, that men are not the purchasers, but women, and they procure them to sicken their husbands of drunkenness, or to relieve them from the effects of it, as the case may be. Be tnis, however, as it may, B yrsv M'ra.A seems to have been a constant purchaser ; she mixed the " quietness" with her husband's broth -with the gravy of his meat-with the mess prepared for his supper-in short, with whatever he ate or whatever he drank. At last the suspidons of the servant girl who waited in the house were excited, and one night, when her mistress was beastly drunlk, she took some of the ",quietness!' poxder from her pocket, and this, after passing through the hands of two or more young women, -was inally handed to the doctr for examination. Not only did B=rsir M31=" for- a considerable, eperiod- continue to mix the powder with her husband's food, but even wahen he lay in his last illiess, - and a few days before hisdeath,shetamperedlwithhismxedicine. Shewas seen by the servant girl to put :somie white powder into a glass cup, snd&to put a little water into it. She then Dut this water into a bottle of medicime, intended -for -her husband's use, and Bhook it u Having done this, she poured out some of the medicine into the cipl and walked up stairs into the room in which her husband was lying onhis -deathbed. She came downstairs presently. witW the cup-empty. As the learned counsel for the defence did- not attempt to disputer the fact that the death-of the- deceased was caused. by antimony, it would be idle to waste words upoa the medical evidence. The only question is, was 'the wretched woman aware that she was poisoning her husband? Did she deliberately intend to shorten his life, or was she simply messing and tampering with quack inedicines, as ignorant people. will do?! 'pon the whole evidence the jury came to the conclusion that a verdicL of "c Manslaughter" would uatisfy the justice of the case, although, for the satisfaction of their consciences, -they accompanied this ve!dict with the reark that they had " taken a very " merciful view of the cme." We will not, in a case in which it is possible to idmit doubt, impugil the decision at which. these -gentlemen arived, although we think most persons wlho read the evidence will be of the same -opinion with the jury themselves-naamely, that they~ took a mercifil -a very- merciful-vievr of the cas - There may, however, have- jleen something in the de- ra our of.

A few days back we reported the trial of a woman who was indicted for endeavouring to murder her husband by mean4 of arsenic. The woman was acquitted, although the case was one of the gravest suspicion. She | procured the arsenic, which her husband cer- I tainly swallowed, whether she intenied bis death - or not, from a wretched shopboy, vho handed it to her as complacently as though it had been 3 pound of figs. Here again we have the case of a woman who is able to procure a poisonous drug, with which she absolutely kills her husband, whether designedly or not again we will not say; but she procures it as readily as starch or sago. The point is one which should receive the instant and most anxious consideration of the Houn SECanrARY.
Very seldom does a dinner excite so mlch feeling as did the war feast yesterday with the Guards. Almost all dinners are prosaic-almost all public dinners are dull. It would be folly .,ua the most glaring ainachronsm in one of our poets to attempt the description of a modern banquet; Hounn might do it, but for usu the thing is absurd. The banquet given yesterday to the Guards, however, was connected vith such -thrilling assocations as completely severed it from that sense of the ludicrous which necessarily belongs to every modern repast. For one maomenat the clatter of lnives and forks, and the exertions of 2,000 gallant fellows, who, " greatly daring"dined,1 created a passing smile. It was only for a moment; the music which immediately struck up suggested thoughts which made many a stout heart swell, partly with triumph, and partly-even in that joyous hour-vith grief. 'Who did nof feel that this was but the merry sequel to far different scenes, and that the treat provided for our soldiers was a happy memento of hunger and thirst, cold and fatigue, and pain, endured for old England far away amid the din of war ? As ever and anon some martial strain was heard, or some plaintive ditty that recaled all the sweetness of home, his must have beern a barren imagination who did not think of these men at very different feasts-plucling the vintage on the slopes of the Alma, hurrying on the dar3; November morning, without food, to the heights of Inlkermann, and enduring the long agony of those months when they ate -their small portion of food half raw, and it seemed as if they were forgotten by their friends at home. It is not often that one can witness a dinner digniied by associations- such as these. Such a sight never has been seen in London, and although littlewas spoken-farless thanis usual at public dinners-perhaps on that very account all the more was felt. It is by a welcome of this kind that we can best repay our soldiers for the past and inspire them for the future. In all the writings of Lord :BAcOe there is not a more true remarL than one whieh he make3 'with regard to the habits of mnilitary men, and which he accounts for by saying, " Perils " commonly ask to be paid in pleasures." Money and promotion are not alone enough; it is in such a joyous welcome as that - of yesterday that our troops are best taught how highly their achievements are prized, and how truly those who sympathized in their privations can share their rejoicing.
THE RESIiRIOXS AT CHRIST CHURCIE COATEDRAL, OsiO0D.-The restorations and alterations at Christ Church Cathedral, which, as we have before sUtatd are being effected by Messrs. L andW. Fisher, builders, of this city, from the designs of Mr. J. Billing, architect, of Abindlon-street, Westminster, are proressing very rapidly, and hold out eeyposethat whe2n coplet-ed the cathedral will,-for architeta ineetad historical associations, although not for size, bear comparison withany ether i t.he lingdo. The architectural beauties of the edifiae, and antestingtgeaAtiofs eiof architetnol sc or embrace o more extended period of existence. The architect now engaged nion ithas shown the most consunmate skill and judgient in his re-arrangement of the interior and in the development of its chief beauties and most striking points. We have so recently detailed the nature of the restorations and alterations that it is unnecessary to recapitulf ethem, but every visit to the works impresses as with an in,x3ssed Eense of their alue andnadvantages. It is noless gratifying to fnd that, in addition to maling the cathedral worthy of its name, and giving increased effect to its services, the present Dean, Dr. liddell in that spirit of progress which has evez been his characteristic, aims at putting Christ Church Cathedral, as far as is practicable, on the same footing as other cathedrals with regard to the public, 'who wi for the futoreenjoy the same facilities of Wttending its services as are now possesse in otber cathedral towns. The north transept, immediately opposite tothe oan, is to be -devoteds 'to the publi, and is t be fittedup-with seats which will acconsmodate at lcast 30 persons. The edifice being .not ony a cathedral but a colleg cshapd, it has been found necessary to modify the new. arrasiemoent to suitboth these characteristi The college sericeR take plaCe at8 0'c10ck Sn the morrinz,and.ata quarter-past 9 in the evening, and these are coned exclusively to memDers and others connected with the College. The cathedral servioes take place at 10 oelockin.the morning and 4 in the afternoo6n and these are open to the public. The present Dean takes, as migutbe expected from him, the atmost interestin the works which, through luis mnstimentality, are now-bei6g carried, out; .and&he giyes the best illusia tion of it by personally overlooking them, spending hour after- hour in wstching their progress, encouraging those 'who are e,ployed Upou them, and in the moat affle and painstn "mnaner p_olntihg -iit to strangers and others who visit .'the cathedral, as 'we ourseLves can testify, the nature of the alterations and the-purposes for which they'bave been; undertaben.

THE ADULTERATION OF DRUGS. TO THE EDITOR OF TE. TIME. Sir,-I trst you will do me the favour to inwert the fol' low ngobservationsmpon your reniarkh upon, my evidanee before the Adulteration Committee. I am made to pay " that one-lIsl the opium offered for sale in this country is adulterated," whereas the question put to me (and mT answer to it) was as to what proportion of the opium im ported was adulterated? Now, as notone-third of the opium imported comes into home ronsigption, there need not of necessity be any wbatever but genuine offered. for sale; the quantity imported varying from 1,000 to 1,500 chests per annum, and the quantity entered for home consumption never exceeding 400 chests. Again, my answer to Lord Claud alnilton's second question was not in-theaffimative, but in the negative, and was in these words, as can be seen in the reported evi. dence:-"It is not ourbusiness to import,butwe are driverx to import goods ourselves because we cannot obtain supplies from the merchants " the inference from which isj that with goods imported by a deaer there is a greatercertainty of procuring a genuine artile, because, if otherwise, he has. the power of Tejectingit on arrival. I am. Sir vour obedient servant. JAMES DREW. I .su1-azne, Aug. '5.

REPORT OF mx DEI ARTrm oZ S=NE Az,-D AnT.-A blue book of 300 pages contains the third reportof the Department of Science and Art, addressed to the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade, &c., by their seeretary, 3M. L_yon Pla-fair. From a summary of the details adduced it apnearsihat the museums and libraries of tire department continneto be ian effective state, and have been visited by3Sl,000 persons, being an increase of S6per cent, above The numbers of the previous lear. This increase is chiefly due to the new sirculating museu of ornamental art, -which has been visited b;y i55701 persons in the provinces, and to thesuccesa which has attended the new arrangements made by The depatment in regai& to the Museum of Natural Historgin Edinburgh, resulting in a increase of the tisitors from the old average ofS00toacovo 100,OO. There has been a considerable diminution inthe attendance on the museums of London from the state of affairs. The Dublin Botanical Gardens have been visited by above 30,000 persons, aud the Zoological Gardens by 133,000. The exidibitions of the department have been visited by. 72,000 persons. The geologicd surveys in Great Britain and' Ireland andtheMini g Record-office continue to be carried' on -with increased activit, and have made during the past ,vesr reports to the Government on various geological sub. jectsof importance to this country and the colonies. The schools of arthavebeen attended by nearly 12,000 pupils. The number of children taught drawing in public schools, through the agency of the masters of art schooL5 amounts to1S,9J88; butthisis not sufflcient to meet the wants of the p'b'.ic, and newi measures ;are being devsed.to give in. - creased developmentto elementary art instruction. Instructioninaratasibeen given to 2,1S1 teachers,nnd the resultar of their exraminations have been more satisfactory than in preceding years. The schools of science, the'worldng men's lectu res m London, and the provincial lectures in Ireland have been attende by 10,000 persons. That valuable in. stitution, the Metropolitan School of Science, applied to mining and the arts, continues to flourish, The sPs, tematic courses during the year included 100 lectUr6 -on chymistry, by Professor Rofraun; 48 on physics, -by Professor Stokes; 60 on metlurgy, bytDr. Percy; 40 on mineralo'y, and 60 on minig, by Profesor Smyth; 30 on geology, ty Professor RanRay- 50 oI natural history, anc., by Professor Huxley;* and 36 on applied mechanics, by Pro-. fessor Willis. Thirty matriculatedl and 56^ general students attended the course of 1855-56. The increase of the Istter is very gratifying. A n evening course of leclures for school. masters has been given during the past year by MEr. Huxley, the Professor of Natural :History, &ic., and a course of chymistry byDr. Hofmnn Lectures toworking men have been given in natural philosophy, chymisty, metals, and mining, the attendance on which has been only limited by the size of the lecture-room. The chymical and metallurIcal laboratories, under the superintendence of Doctors sofmnan andPercy, have been in full operation, and respectively attended by 100 and 27 nupils. Dr. Percyhas now in the press an elaborate inquiry on the composition of the iron ores of England; and he has isade an elaborate campanalogical inquiry, with a view to ascertain the best composition for the great bell of the New Piae at West. minster. Dr. Hofmann has made severa valuable reports. The Museum of Practical Geology has been usefully emnploed in aiding the authorities on questions of importance both at home and in the rolonies. ribute is borne to the increasing 'sefDuleas of other collsteral institutions, MuriDER Y?

The United States' mail steamship Arago had arived at Newr York, andc the Royal mail steam- Canada ae Halifax, on the Ilth inst. The foliowing is the letter of -our NIew York correspondent, dated August 12:- "The health of this city engrosses more of the attention of those who are obliged to remain in it uncder the August suns than any of the publie matters of the natiorn If you exaxmne the daily journals of New Yorl;, you will see how the mysteAiouz diease which hovers in the harbour below is watched with alternate fear oiid hope. 120 sail me now in quarantiub', many with the yellow fever on board. The disease has travelled outsidelthe walls of the hospital into the village at its gates, and the inhabitants, imitating those of San Franclsoo; havr organized a vigilance committee of Eafety,- and barricaded the gate to interdict all cormm unication with the village, and with the crowded ferry which carries thoand to and from New YoAk from the very door of the hospital. The Kuxtherly breeze which blowvs in nightly from the. oean, and is generally welcomed as a restorer of vigour to wasted frames, this year passing ovreÂ± the anfeted vessels has carried the poison to the neighbouring shore of Long Island. The troops stationed withia the fort have suffered severely, and more than one of the inhabitants of the beautiful vilas which line the shore have falen victims. Thus far the city of New York has been substantially free. The few deaths that have taken place here have been directly Itraceable to contact -with thae infected shipping. But how long can this last, with the disease so near this great population, as crowded, lving in as miserablo tenements, and as muoh from hand to mouth ms any part of the similar population of London ? The medical officers at quarantine profess to believe that the danger is passing away; that the vessels ariving with disease on board are fewer and fewer; and that the local cases are decreasing. I hope this may prove to be true, for I cannot conceive. of anything more dreadful than the introduction smong the poor population of this great city of a violent pestilence with which al the local physicians are unacquainted. Its effect upon the commerce of the port also, and through that upon English interests, cnnot beover-estimated. Should it come, it would seem, from the laws that have hithierto governed it, that it must make its appeariform in the course of the next fortnight or threa wee;s, and tvhen will run itself out in the course of six weeks. We earnestly hope that the vigorous measures which arc now adopted will keep it away altogether. "Congress are busily engaged, and from present appearances will be ready to adjourn by tho 18th, the day named in the joint resolution. There will be a disagreement about the appropriations. and, from presentappearances, the whole army appropriation will fail, and each party will go to the country charging it on the other, and using it for electioneering purposea. There was at one time (and still is with many in the House, where the Republicans are in the majority) a disposition to stop all the supplies unless the United States' troops are withdrawn fromn Kansas, and the Legislature wvhich the Misourians forced upon the territory is disavowed. But I think wser counsels will prevail, and that the only appropriation which will fai wMil be the Army Bill, for which the Senate will be responsible. The bill (originated in the House) will provide for the payment of the whole mrmy, prohibiting payment for services in Kansas. The Senate will proebably insist on striking out the prohibitory clause, anld thus, unless partytactics are catnged during the week, the anny will have to go unpaid till nexrt winter. " We have had a newF Cuba canard started from Washington-that the Emperor Napoleon wishes to buy it, and-that England nowv desires Spain to sell it to the1.ated States. lThe Frenchiiinister at Washing4on-:hss considered it of sufficient consequence to deny the story (in conversation), saying that France has no desire or intention to get possession of Cuba, and that no steps have been taken to that effect. " The opminon is gaining ground at Washington among the Republican members that Fremont will be elected. The aspect of the first election does not indicate much hope for the friends of Mr. Filhmore. KEentucksy, wfhich was a Know-nothing strong,hold, lies gone for the.I)emaerucy; and North Carolina, an O)ld lVhlg State, has done the same. The Southern Fillmore members of Cong,ress a;re gradually coming in to the support of Mr. Buchanan, recognizin, the danger of Fremont's election and the lecessity of united action against him. The " old 'lir 'Whigs" are making an effort to revive the g~7host of that zspectable, party; but all the present indications are that3the contest will be substantially rconfinedto 33uchananand Fremont. I have several times given you my views as to the probabilities, andmyreasons forthem. Theunexpectedly strong vote which the ROepuAreans received at Iowa, the election of a Republican to the next Congress from the Slave State of Mi3souri, and the enthusiasm which animates the Republican party throughout the north-west has led many well-informed persons in Washington to look for the election of B'remont. The fear of this has actually had aim effect upon the value of real estate in Waahington, abisurd as it may seem. In the eyes of Southern propertyholders the election of a President, pledged to the restriction of slavery, from Kansas, and to hostility to Fillibusterism, portends disunion and destruction to their property. I need not say that no such consequences need be feared. There would be some storming, bat the South would very soon find that it has control of the Senate with a voice upon the appointments; and the country would probably jog on more harmoniouily than 'it baa ifor many a year. Filibustering and slve extension would be put an end to, and stealing (either territory or men) would kecome unproÂ£itable. "Instructions have gone outto Mr. Dallas to neotiate for thte settlement of the Central American question aubstantially on the basis advocated by The Times long since-the cession of Itnatan to Hondurm, the extinguishment of the sovereignty . of the Mosquitoes, and the establishment of Greytown as a free port. It is to be hoped that this vexatious question will now be for ever set at rest. Seven years ago next December this Govermnent, through its Minister at London, Proposed the settlenent which now appears a'bout to be consnuamated Instead of awcepting the prop?osition both 4Govermnentr negotited, -and.produced the Clayton.Blw73ller Traty, of wthich GMeneral Taylor said it wtould-require another treaty to explain it. r '"As the Presidential coutest -waxe3 warm, and the issue, at first apparently cerain for the democracy, grows more oub , it becomes bitter, vitnperative, or porsonal.

On the other hand, Mr. Fremont: who up to this time has enjoyed a reputation of sminuar purity,' is charged with peculation of the pubhac funds whiile anofficer in California, and the- Senate of the United States have lent them,selves ito the charge by sanctioning the call of Mr. Bigler (an Admini. strative senator and personal friend of Mr Buchanan) for an e ,parte sttemen of his ac counts while conqmuering our Eldorado, in which I anticipate that the officials willm tr to make it appear that a man wlhose reputation ought to be cherished as. national property has descended to the meanness of public plunder. It is the curse of publi life- in this mcury that honest men's reputations are neverfree from such vituperation.

THE BASHI-BAZOUKS. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A leading article in your isgue of the 23d of Jaly contans uch a serere attac on the late corps of Osmai Irregular Cavalry that I am convinoed there must be some mistake in the sourcefrom which you derived your information. Tho corps ws never stationed at GallipolL They merely landed at, and marched past, that place en. roz:te to Sh-mIO in November, 1855, and althougl upwards of 3,000 mnen disembarked there, not one sngle comnplaint of any sort was made against them eitherby the Exench or Tnti5oh authoriti es. From the date of their leaving t'he Dardanelles until their Arrival at Shuyola certificates from the chief Turkish authorities at all the halting pises on the line of march prove that no outrae of any sortwans committedons ThepRepe oE the country, vwhile, on tihe other hand, tho prsnih!imenb returs of each regiment. showr that. any brea of discdpline dauring tbo march was duly punished. The Basfii-Barouk being by no means a favourite in Turkey, a wide field vas laid- open for cornaints against them on tho arrival of the force at Shuma in Decomber, 1855, more especialy, as about ZGmen were either placed in barracks Cose to, or billetted in, the town. The records of the force and the erEtiffcates from the rkish civil and military local authorities show that duinug their stay at Shnmla thc Bashi-Bazouks beha'ved themselves much the same as any other rational beings; the necessary parades and drills took place, which by the way, the men took to most willingly and the usal routine of military duty -was carried out in the various regiments and brigades. It would, of course, be nonsense to say that no crime was committed, but it is trae that the number of offenders wlmasyry consi-derablybelowvtheaverage tobeexpected from a British force of the same strength, the more so as tho town oE Shumla contains a great number of thelowest description of liquor shops, which the Brit;sh officers, of course, had no power to close without authority from the Turks. Wfhen midemennours were committed the offender ws invarnaiy tried before a court-martial, and the setence fully carriedi into effect, the court bein composed of a mix. ture of British and native officers, and the justice of the sentence of these cours (in several cases moost severe) waxs in no one single instance ever questioned bythe men. When the order for disbandment wvas issued inJunue Last much regret was expressed by the men at leaving the British service. The force ad assumed the appearance, and, to the best of my belie., had the spirit of a most powerful, disci. plined body of men, and- the native officers, at first the most troublesome of al to deal with, owned the advantages of our disc pline, and for the mosb part assisted to tho utmost the British officers. The regiments, for the purposo of being disbanded in the respective places of their enlistment, are now on the line of march, ard, from the reports received of their progress, no troops in theovoildcould have made sucha successionof long mrches (in several instances 35 miles a-ay, and seldom less than 20), the average length of the march of each regimaent to its place of disbandment being 450 miles;- 'he reports received-from the Turldsh authorities of the districts through which the regiments have marched show a total freedom from riot or outrage of any sort. You wfl, I trust, Sir, in justice to the British officers of this force, by vhose labour the above satisfactory state of disdpline has bean brought bout, afford this letter as pro. mine=t a position in your paper as you have the accsations you have allowed to appear, and not permit any aisonderstandingto cast a slur ueon those who have been workig to their utmost to get inito order and discipline a body of men the want of whom, in the event of war haying lasted, would veysoon have made itself apparent.

THE CLmiS oF THE CoRT F .A=z-There is nothing that needs more caution than the pretensions of pnvate parties to national testimonias, whether of a purely honorary or of a pecuniary nature. The case ought to be a very strong one to jnstify the press in recommending it to the public, oftcen inclin!ed, in the generosity of its instincts, to concede demands upon its bounty writh too easy scrutiny into the merits1 of the claimants. It does, however, seem to us that the case stated on behalf of thefamilyof HenryCort, the acknowledged inventor of thoseprocess : the working of iron which have more than any other proceses in our manufactures contributed to the commercial gretness of England, is one wvhich we may honestly advocate. Tbat Cort was entitled to be called the fonder of the existing British irontrade,-that his inventions made us indepemdent of Russia and Sweden for our supplies of the most important of our modern n -seems to be well established. His son and daughters, reduced to poverty, have presented 5 petition to Parliament5 -setting forth tleir father's history and industrial aehievements; and to this petition they have subioinel the testimonies of some of our most eminent engineers and ironmaster3 to the validity of Cort's claim to be: considered the exclusive autlor of the improvements with which his naxe is connected. It would ill becomoe 'a great commeril country lke ours to ba indifferent to an apeal of thig description; and we feel cerin it will not b made in v3an. There are statements indeed made in the memorial of the accuracy of which we are not in a position to form anopinion. Henry Cort obtainod patentsforhiitimprove. ments, and is said to have expended -considerable fo-tune in bringing his processes to perfecton. It is thern alleged that, aftsr contracts had been signed by the leadimg ironnmsters of the kdngdom to pay him l0s per ton for the uso of his methods, be was involved in the ruin of a public defaulter (the then'Treassrer of the Navyorhia deputy), withe out any guity complicity in his crinmes, and lot not only his patents, but all that he possessed. There is an obscurity over-this part of the case which we shonld gladly see cleared up; but the other features of it are strong enough to justoiy us in commending it thus briefly to the consideration of the public.-Rxamhi7er.

THE DI)INER TO THE GUABDS. I ~~~. . I -- . Of anl methods of ugadmratinna dixner appears to be the most congenial to the social instincts and convivial haDits of the British people; sad accordiigly, when itW proposed, some weeks ago, to invite the Guards to a public banquet, the Suggestion was received with universal approbation. The much talked of entertainment took place yesterday at the Royal Surrey Gardens, andpassed off wit.hthe greatest &dat. The wpeather, that enigma in the solution of which tho hopes and fears of the publ are centred on all festive occasions, was. on the whole as propitious as we have a right-to expeet in these eccentric latitudes, and the scene in-the pleaure grounds was exceedfngly briliant ad animated. The Grenadiers marched froni their barracks in Birdcaoge-*alk over Westminsterbridgetothegardens. TheFusileersqwhosebarracks are at Charing-cross, passed over Waterloo-bridge,, following the CGrenadiers from the Elephant and Castle. The Colistreafas marchel from the Tower over London-bridge, by the Elephant and Castle, ancl thence to the p,axdens by the soune route ass the other regiments. Added to thoer -w;as a large body of Guardsmen who are stationed at. Aldershott and Windsor, and. whom the directors of the SouthWestern Railway liberally conveyed to London and back free of all expense. The streets through which the troops passed were densely crowded, and the cheering of the. people was raost enthusiastic. The officers were in undrems uniform ; the men wore their foraging caps, not their bearLkius, and, except in a few instance, did not carry side. arms. The Grenadiers, under Colonel Foley, were the first to arrive, and were followed shortly aÂ£ter, wards by the Coldstreams, under Colonel Fpton, and the Fusileers, under Colonel Ridley. Ech regiment waa preceded by its band, the Grenadiers playig " British Grenadiers," the Coldstreams "Hlome, Sweet Home," and the Fusileers "Annie Laurie," whica last air is in specia 'favour. Every man wore a Crimean medal, and -many also dis- ,Lsayed theriband of the Legion of Honour. The oncerb MAI, in which dinner was served for 400 men of each reginent, was beautifully decorated for the occasion, and presented a magnificent appeaance. There was a profusion of military trophies; the flags of England, France, Turkey, and Sarainia wero suspended from .the gaReries and balconies, and' fedtoons of flowers and garlands of laurel met the eye in every direction. Shields inscribed with the names of distinguished officers of the allied armies, and in each case encircled with branches of laurel, were ranged in front of the first gallery, and had a very pretty effect. These names were not elassifed with reference to the countries of their respective owners, but were mingled fraternally together, comanionship in glory being the common bond of union. The shields e, boithe followinginscriptions .-" "Macdonald," " Dundas," "Evans," "Bruat," "Windham,"~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~t RagAu,""ornto, 'qlan," "tIassy," " :Bosquet," " Lyons," " Simpson," "WMilliams," C: Canrobert," " Pehissier," " Cardigan," and "Lucan." Behind the chair was a white escutcheon, bearing the name of "Florence Nighting,ale," the word " Redan" being inscribed in the left corner and "Malakhoff" in the right. The company assembled in the galleries was fashionable and numerous, and a large proportion of the spectators were ladies. The gallery facing the chair was occupied by officers, among whoni we observed Lord Rokeby, Lord Sefton, Lord G. Paget, Lord Bingham, the Earl of Carrick, Lord F. Paulett, Sir W. Codrington, Sir R. Barnard, Colonel the Hon. E. Upton, Colonel the Hon. A. Foley, Colonel Ridley, Colonel Steele, LieutenantGeneralAirey,LieutenanntColonelHiggiman,jMajor- -General C. Russell, Colonel F. Seymour, Colonel Ponsonby, Lieutenant-ColonelHatton, .LieutenantColonel Elison, Lieutenant-Colonel Strong, Colonel B3rownowl(hox, MA'., &c. The private box; to the right of the chair was set as ide for the LFord Mayor and hissuite, while that on theoeft reserved for the membersof the committee and their friends. Theconsolidated bands of the three regiments of Gpards, under the direcdiin of the masters, Mfr. Godfrey Mr. Boossi, and Mr. D. Godfrey,- filled the orclestra.. In the gallery above them were seated a number of vocalists, chiefly amateurs, under the leadership. of Mr. Iand. The body of the hall not affording sufficient apace for the accommodation of all tho Guardsmen who were invited, those who could not find room within its walls were entertained in a great tent formed by an awninm extending from the top of the fireworks balcony' to the margin of the artificial waters. The lower windows of the hall were taken out, with the view of enabling the men who were not seated in the building to hear and take part in the proceedings after;the dinner, and it is hardly necessary to state that they fared no worse than those who were seated in the halL An elegant marqu ee was erected in the Dlantation, to the South of the Music Hall, for the accommodation of the bands. It had been originally intended by the committee to invite the wives of the Crimean Guardsnen to witness the splendid spectacle, but, imbappily, the warhad converted so many of those wives into widows that it was deemed more udicious to abandon the design. Some idea of the havoc that death ha macde in the ranks of the Guards who landed at Old Fort with the invading armies may beformed when it isstated that of all the wives of soldiers in the Grenadier Guards there are only 13 whose husbands have returned to them. It has been objected against Englishmen that they suffer from mnzauvaie honte-that " they fear each other, fearing none besides ;" but assuredly there was little symptom of any such weakness among the guests at yesterday's entertainment. They took their seats in an orderly and decorous manner, and; though in the presence of lords and ladies, were as calm and self-possesed as if it were Muscovites that they were going to attc, and not rounds of beef and doulble Glocestes The Grenadiers were ranged on the right of the ch3irman, the Coldstreams on his left, and the Fusileers, who were accompanied by their pipers, occupied the centr of the hall. The chair was taken by SergeantMajor Edwards, the senior sergeant of the Guards. He claims the honour of being the oldest soldier in the British army; yet he is by no means an old man. He miust have entered the service at an unusually early age, for though ho has worn uniform for one-and-twenty years he is stil in the prme.of life. He served during the whole of the Crimean campaign, and was offered a commssion, but declined it. On his return from the Est the Queen sent for him and appointed him one of the Yeomen of Her Majestys Guard. He is the Prince of Wales's preceptor in Calisthenic exercises, and has been givenf to understand that he is to have an office in the Prince's household as soon as the establishment of his Royal Highness shall have been formed. On taking his seat at the head of the table, he was reeeived with an enthusiastic shout of applause, which he acknowledged with the cordial courtesy of a soldier. He was supported on each side by three staff sergeants-tall massive fellows with suburnt faces and beards that tho birds might build their nests in.- When the company were all seated and the hall was one blase of scarlet the bands struck up" H'aste to tho Fedding," but, inasmuch as there were- no brides with whom to contract marriage, the guests paid their addresses to the good things spread before them. The dinner, which -was provided by Messr. Potel and Chabot, of Paris, who have the management of the refreshment department of the gardens, was, no doubt, a delicate repast, but to thosevho looked down upon it from the galleries it aDpeared to be .rather deficient in that solidit for whfc-h Guardsmen are so famous on the battle-field, and -which we pre6ume they have no objection to recognize upon the dinner-table. HIowever, they who eat a iinner mu3stbe presuxned to be better judges of it than thow who merely look. at it, and it is due to the puirveyors to say that the guests appeared to be well pleased- with the fare set before them; and certainly they did it ample justice. A bottle of champagne was shared by every three men, and each man had a bottle of Dublin stout all to himself, and a quarter of a pound of tobacco to take home with him. This was treatment which, contrsted awith.the trenches- gave-peculiar significance to the entntwhich e bauds were continually inculcating, that there is no place like home. Grace waa said by the Rev. MaXWe Egan, chaplain to the forces in the Crimea; Mr. Harker,-thewell-known. toastmaster, rendered hii services gratuitousy.

Drink it three times throe and upstanding. . The toast was received with rapturous acclamation. The National Anthem was played with splendid effect by the 'various bands, the vocal portion being executed by 300 choristers, in conjunctionwith the wholeof the Gardsrmen. The- Ct3AUMA -Comrades, Ihave got- another tost to propose to You (cheers), aid Ih,Ave a notion that it will please yon veu neirly asmuich as tho last.

I want you todriak tothe health of "Prince Albert -and the 'rest of tho RoysFamily." (Loud cheers.) Novw, mind I say "the rest of the Royal -Family" which, of. course, includes my pupil she Prinoe of Wales. (Cheers.) May he followin'the steps oEhisRoyal parents, and may tho dxy be distant whin hea wil wear the British Crown! '(Loud chees) The toast was drmnk amid repeated rounds of zpplause, the band playing the Coburg 5areh. Tho next _toast being one of particular importAnce, Mr. Barker, the toastmaster, caled on the company to filla bumper. He waved his white wand in the air, and, in a voice that would be worth any money to a general of divi. sion, exclaimed,. "Charge -" The statled Guardsmen sorang to their feet and looked fiercely around as much as Ito say "Whom ?I At length they were relieved from their embarrassment by the excellent official who had created it, and who now added, in accents soft a3s the breath of southern zophyrs, " Your glasses, gentlemen, yoiur glassas." When the peal of laughter wbich this little incident evoked had died avay, Ths CRAM-Aff again wos and saa,s-Another toast for you! (Cheers.) I beg to propose " His Royal Highness the General Commanding-in-Chief, our soldiers and sailors, the chaplains of the army, and our brave allies in the late war." (Vehement applause.) I wish to say a few words to yon as comrades. Now, mark me, wish to talk to you as comrades. Hear me, old hands of Alma and InkermannI I need not say anything to you in praise of the Dnkeof Cambridge. (Cheers.) He must livein your hearts andin the hearts of al7 British soldiers as he wiui in mine eternally. Our greatest pride must be to say that we were Guardsmen at Inkermann. (Enthusiastic cheering.) The Duke of Cam. bridge was there (oud cheers), and that issaying enough about him. As for ow brethren of tho line, I am sorry-if I can be sorry for anything on such an occasion-that the table was not big enough for them as well as for us, But, as the table was too small (laughter), I am sure that they will not envy us our hsppinss; but, on the contrary, that they Wi bo rejoiced to learn that we have been so well received. As for our sailors, the good feeling that subsists between you and the bluo-jackets Is known to the world. We ar indebted to them, and they are indebted to us for many a Indno'ess. You know it as well asI do. (Cheers.) There never was anything like the good feeling which subsisted during the wr 'between you-the "red soldiers as they called you-andthe blue-jackets themselves. (Lo0d cheers.) With respect to our brave allies, if I were the greaest speaker that ever lived, I could not do jastice to their noble conduact. Oh, my comrades, -you saw the day when you could have knelt -down and worshipped them as you would your God. Don't you remember when you saw them coming over tho hill? (Tremendous cheering.) As for the chaplains in the army, they did their duty like men, and so little notice has been takon of them in military assamblies that I am sure you 'will be glad to haveanopportunity to return them th=ks -for all their i-ndness. Therefore, I include them in the toast, comrades, aa I hope you will Inake it a b7mnper.ea Mr. HARnMn-A bumper I a bumper I Make readypresent-ire I (Cheers, and laughter.) The toast was drunk with great enthusiasm. The national ais of- France, Sardinia, and Turky were played by thS band, and the following song, written for the oecasion by Mr. G. Linley, wts rug by the chorus, ana rapturously encored - Oh! brave were England's mailed knights, That won at Agincourt, ,And bright the page of his'ry shines With deeds they dsd of yore. But ne'er was valour more display'd, In battle's mad career, Than by the gallant British hearts Whom nowr wewl1relcome here.

Now mind, when I say "the chairman"I wish you clearly to understand that I do not mean myself. (Cheers and laughter.) I inean the chairman of the committeeanother person Altogether. (Cheers.) I have very few *ords -to siy, but I am sure the toast Will speak to your hearts. First and foremost, comrades, you are invited to a dinner such as I sup. pose the memory of man never saw anything to equal it. (Cheers and laughter.) Now, understand what I mean. Your coming here is an honour to you, because it shows that your countrymen, the people of Englad, are satisfied with the manner in which you did your duty. You did your duty, or you wouldn't be here; so ri say no more about it. (Cheers and laughter.) But it is clear that we ought to return to the chairman, the committee, and the subscribers our most grateful thanks. Aih! we have seen the day that we never could have dreamt that such a day as this woutd occur in the history of the best of us, Think of what you have gone through, think of what you have seen, and then look around you! WVhy, man dear, I could jump into another campaign to get another such welcome as this. (loud cheers.) There's not a man of us that would not volunteer to-morrow for another war after what we have seen to-day. (Reneowed pplause.) The toast was received with the greatest enthusiasm. The LosinMAYOac as chairman of tha dinner oommittee, returned thanks from his box. He sold that in coring forward to return thanks on behalf of the, committee and the other subscribers to the dinner fund, he must begin with an apology, foi he felt that he was unused to that short, sharp, and decisive battlefield oratory which he had heardiht day from the chairma He must therefore addrs them as a civilIL, and though, probably, hbis words would be rather longer, he could assure them they would have an equal meaning. The subibers to the dinner fund thought that it would be agreeable-to the regiments and to the officers, as well aa satisfactory to the public, that -the brave Gunard, who were the ordinary garrison of London, should be aisembled together as' far as aocommodation permitted, that the subscribers might have- the plasure, on behalf ofthe people of Lndon, of seeing face to face r0 many gallant men whb bore on their breasts 'the prond testimonsal of Ieiir esys approbation. -(t'oud cheers.) -Sergeant-Ia6r Edwards had'sa.d whei2 propoding the health of ihe Commandor-in.Chief, that he lived in. the. -hearts of British soldier. He (the Lord Mayor) would say that the noble duke, in conjunction with all the brave men of the army, lived in the hearts of the British people, .who would .never forget how the honour of Enl=ad had been supported by 'the noble conduct 'of every man in the army during the last war. (Loud cheerm.) If the 'hearts of -the soldiers hid been dolighted that day bY the good cbeer 'bich had been aot beFore tlem, the- committee and the suimribers equaly felt delight ia seeing so many men who had rendered service to thieir country contgreg'a -n that hall, and on their behalf he retmred thanks for the lindly feelingswhich thE soldiers had expressed.: (Cheers.)

The hall was cleared in s.few minutes, and after having'"unfurledthebanner of gastronomy"-to use the magnificent expression of 31. Soyer -and partaken to their heartat content of the substnitial joys of life, the Guardsmen repaired to the pleasure ground where they tasted of those pleasures of the imagmaton which nowihere abound in more rich profusion than in the. Surrey Gardens. They wandered as fancy led them through the towers, palaces, mosques, and minarets of the City of the Sultan, or . auntered by the margin of that noble expanse of pipe-water which does duty for Bosphoruz-or pufed a'cloud on the Grecian terrace, or dived into the mystic recesses of the Rermit's' cave, which we are credibly assured by ,the guide-book " overwhelm the visitor with gloomy awe ;" or they contented themselves with roaming about on the soft sward - and observing with what grace the Italian style of gardening blends into the old Engish, style, with its more rugged aspects,' its avenues of trees, and its bolder and more varied display of. flowers. Nor were enjoyments of a more tender, though possibly of a less intellectual order wanting, for Ethiopians sang the sorrows of "Lucy Neal," and a nmber of arEtst in Mesh-coloured tights and spangles wvalked about upon theirheads, and exerted t emselves most strenuously to induce the belief that they had been born without backbones. After the lapse of about two hours the soldiers were marched back into the Music-hall, the centre of which was specially reserved for them. A vocal and instrumental concert, of which the following is the programme, then took place:- PArer L Overture-" RnyBlas" ... ... Mendelssohn.

TUhe eveniing's entertaintnents concludeZ with a dislay of firewforks, which for beaulty of design aiid .brfliaancy of colour have never been surpassed in London. The soldiers were then mustered, and marched home at9 o'clock. Independently of ,the military ther could not have been less than 20,000 persons present. NTor must we forget to mention that among the ilustrious visitors was Mrs. Seacole, whose appearance awakened the nost rapturous enthusiasm The soldiers not only cheered her, but chaired her around the gardens, and she really anight have suffered from the oppressive attentions of her admirers, were it not that two sergeants of extraordinary stature gallantly undertook to protect her from the pressure of the crowd. However, the excellent lady did not appear intheleast alarmed, but, on the contrary, smiled most graciously and seemed mhlTy gratified. It is due to those who originated this entertainment, and to those also who superintended its details, to say that the arranpgments were in all respects admirable. They refiected the highest credit on all who were concerned in them, anEd on no one more so than on Mr. Sams, the honorary secretary, on whom devolved much toil and responsibility, aind whose exertions were beyond all praise. Everything- that theo men expressed a wish for was conceded with a grace which greatly enhanced tho favour, and even when they requested that they might have copies of the concert programmaes to preserve as. mementoes, orders were given to the printers to strike them off with-all possible rapidity, and every soldier was provided with a copy before he left the grounds. The liberality of the Directors of the Royal Surrey Gardens should also not be forgotten. Not only did they grant the ase of their beautiful pleasure-grounds gratuitously, but they placed at the disposal of the committee the receipts at the doors up to 5 o'clock.

FfO.RBIGN LElFyJBI j - 'RAIOE. (FRolI om owN OOR POm mqT.) A portion of thba-fouowivg xppeae In our *cond cR,L8a of yester-Iy;-] ?AiIS, SuSDAY, 6 pm. When the famous Manzanaxres manifeso (wrung from O'Donnell by the critical position of himself. and his handful of cavalry) and intelligence of insurrection at Saraga and other provincial towns calUed Mladrid to arms smnall veStiges remained of tJS6 Nat'onal Guard dissolved ina 1843. M AIany of 'the men were there, although in 11 years. their inumbers had been greatly thinned by death and other cause3; but th serviceable muskets had been taken from them, the trim uniform had pased'into the stomach of the moth or the bag of the old clothesman,-their former organization had been nearly forgotten. Civilian coats and jackets were seen at the barri. cadez, and old bluncderbusses, fowling-pieces, and pistols did duty for more efficient weapons. The contest over, tho formation of the National Guard commenced, and was carried on with gteat activity. Money was granted by the Government for the supply of arms; the Cortes, when they met, voted furither sums ; the tailors coula not meet the demand for unifor -s; ans bscriptions were made to equip those Nationals who were too poorto supply themselves. The zeal with -which the chiefs of the Progresista party urged on the organization of the civic troops showred the importance they attached to them as a guarantee of the liberties of Spain. In an inconceivably short time the National Guard of M1adrid assumed, as far as arms and clothing weent, the appearance of a regular force, and the commandants of battalions, several of whom were officers of the army, did their utmost, by exercise anddrill, to supPIly those military qualities in which the newly-raised body was naturally deficient. A very few months after the revolution 20,000 men, comTpletely armed and uniformed, wrer passed inf review at Madrid, and although the progress had not been universaly so rapid throughout Spain, still, in many districts and provincial towns it had kept pacewith that of the capital. To see those strong batZalion3 march past, in g-od order and with well-kept arms, one. might have supposed the Liberal party were right in their anticipations, and that there w-as good security against the recurrence of readion. 17is National Guard, its admirers fondly predicted, would not be easily disanned, like that of 1843. For the time it quite eclipsed the army, then rather under a cloud, in vulgar estimation, and was accordingly looked upon by the regulars with considerable envy and dislike. An assemblage of its chiefs formed an important political conclave, and they scrapled not to asemble, when they fancied the occasion fitting, to intimate their approval or disapproval of the acts of the Government, or at least to send deputations of support or sympathy to Espartero. Such meetings and deputations became important demonstrations, when they were considered to represent the feelings and opinions of more than 20,000 citizens of -Madrid, a great many of them persons of substance and heads of families. Measures were taken to prevent such intermeeddling, but they were only partially effectual. The name of the National Guard, too, was often taken in vain by designing persons, belonging both to the ultra-iaberal and the reactionary parties. Often were reports spread in Madrid of disaffection in such and such battalions, of ill-feeling towards the Cortes on account of some particulawr vote, or of its waste of time in idle talk while weighty guestions penlded. MIore than once it was said that bodies of Nationals had laid a plan to enter the Chamber and clear it of the deputies, as untrue to their trust and negligent of their mission. For most of thesereports there wras probably little or no foundation; but, neverthele.s, they contributed, in conjunction with its political attitude and other causes, to render the lNational Guard extremely distasteful to many, and especially t4 the Yicalvarists. O'Donnell, who never liked the institution, had declared himself in favour of its revival merely because he knew that he could not otherwise hope for the confidence and support of the Progresistas, without which he was a lost man. As Espartero's colleague, he was compelled to favour and almost to fatter it, to lavish upon it bows and smiles and. handahakings. But he probably was always resolved to get rid of it as soon as a fair opportunity offered. 'When, on FsDartero's fall from power, he inaugurated his preiaierhip. by the prodamation of martial law, he must have felt quite certain that he was maling himself that opportunity. We know that he had proposed to profit by it by concentrating troops on Mfadrid. The time had arrived to test the real value of that army of. armed civilians, wn which certain Liberal politicians had put such faith as security for freedom. Theywere well armed, they knew their ground, they had artillery and highly defensible positions. And' doutless many of them fought most bravely; but the long habit of military discipline, which constitutes the chief force of large bodies of armed men. wa wanting, as were also capable chiefs and proper direction; the military men who commanded some of the battalions were for the most part absent; there was no concerted plan, nor any efficient general to frame one and carry it out; many of the civilian officers, either from trewaery, indecision, or fear of responsibility, appear to have left their men to themlselves; there was doubtless a great deal too much talk and too may counsels, and probably not a few mothers and wives, sweethEeartbsand sisters, proved sad dampers of warlike ardour. The result was, that only a small part of theNational Guardfought at all, that the brunt of the fightingg was borne by one or two battalions and by the bullfighters and other desperadoes of the Toledo. Embajadores, and circumjacent streets, and that, after a protracted and deadly contest, the immense superiOrity of regular troops over civilian soldiers, even wheen the advantage of position is in favour of the latter, and the small value of a Spanish National Guard as a guarantee for Spanish freedom, were, not for'the first time, fully proved and established. In Barcelona the confEict, as was to be expected from the different character of the population, from the vwell-known coumage and tenacity of the Catalans, and from the co-operation of numerous foreig refugees, experienced in barricades and street fiaht, ing, was more severe and bloody, but it ended, asa in Madrid, by the triumph of the army. At Saragossa, the ProOoresista citadel and boasted bulwark of freedom, not a shot was fired, and the sole result of a shlow of resisÂ£tncc w as that the NTationlals gave up their arms by invitation instead of by command. Disarmed throughout the whole of Spain the much-vaunted National Guard stitl for a short time escaped dissolution. Even 'in Spain-that paradise of political renegades-a man so prominent as O'Donnell may hesitate a moment before veering completely round, and destroying that which, two years before, he had procled a necessity and contributed to create. There was talk of a-modification, of a new National Guard on the most approved principle, composed of prosperous heads of families and considerable taxpayers-such a body, in short, as, if it ever did muster with bellicozo intent, could be easily dispersed by a few companies of sharpshooters. But even such-a phantom ofthe popular force found no toleration im cerain quarters. larlesa as a fact, it would be unle6AZt as a sn1mento. - Royalty must have smez at ita conrand, bi -itbhas alwaysa been con: sidered that none which ever decked the face of Queen Isabella IL. cost her a greater effort than thoze she ws sit times compelled to bestow upon her faithful anld loyal Naitional Guards. So th'ere is no ca use for urprise that the MHadr& aazeti contains a deerea dissolvingg that body,-d t,at to-day a semi-official correspondence from the Spanlish capital says that the. Minity in this case has been- compelled to yield to t ower superior to its on. This last annoucement sperihaps intende1 aSanece for Marshal O'Donnel. We are .to inter that he hCs =acrificed his own Will (and the National -Guard) 'to that of his Sovereign. If the latter -was stubborn, he still had two alternativesthe convocation of the Cortes or resignation. Are we to suppose that the Court feAls itself so powerful that it ventured to. bid him resign or yield? The point in dispute being the suppression of the Nationl Guard, it probably cost hinr no great effort to adopt the latter course. Scarcely a week passes that the Spanih Ministerial organs do not inform the world that the most ectharmony reign betweeni the Crown and the rllty, and also between the various membera of the Cabinet. Such extraordinary iteration is impolitic, 'sinca it naturally leads many to suppose . that the pretended harmonycoversreal'-discord.

The day before yesterday the King held a vey, briMiant parade of the troops of the garrisonUnter den Linden, the field day that had been ordered for the previous day at the Kreuzberg havng been necessailycountermanded on account of the bad weather; and yesterday all thle troops of ' the Guard Corps marched out from here at an earlyI hour for the purpose of -afield manceuvre, which: will last till the 29th or-Sth. On these occasions. the men get a taste of the agr6mes of a bivouac,' having to pass the night -in the open air without tents or any other accommodation but that an army. on the march can be supposed to carry with il. Inad dition to the Prince of Prussia, who arrived here intime for the parade on Thursday, the Hereditary: GrandDuke of TuscanyandPrince Charles of Bavaria> were in the brilliant retinue that followed the Xina as he rode down the lines, and surrounded him at the saluting point, which, as usual, was cliosen-infront of the statues of Blucher, Gnteisenau, an4 Yorce. The Prince of Prussia is to proceed to the pro-. vince of Pomeraiia, of which he is Stadtholder- on the 28th inst., for the purpose of attending the, manceuvres of the 2d army corps wILich' is stationed at Stargard, and thence he will go on:to Reilsberg for the manceuvres of the ls; -army corps. It would seem as if the original plan of the' Eing's going to Konigsberg for the manceutvres this month hiad been given up, an i it is now understoodthat he will on September 23 arrive in Coblenz. and on the 28th go on to Treves, to be present aii the consecration of the Basilica. The Hereditary Grannd Duke of Tusty,'-th-' recently betrothed of the Princess Anne of Eaxony, who has been here for the last few days, left lst night for Stettin, en roaue for Copenhagen. He is a pretty-looking boyish youth of 21, and resmnrkable among the many military by whom he Mwas surrounded during his -stay here by his beardless face and very fanciful head-gear., A few months back we had a good many .reports afloat of visits that the Emperor Louis Napoleon intended to pay to rarious ptrfs of Gemaany, Switzerland, &c..; that onae of thee reports, the one with reference to Carlsbad, was in a great degree grounded is evident from the following :-In- the month of May a young French physic' of high repute with the faculty in-Paris, arrivedhere and consulted one of the most skilfu pathologisbs of this place, described very accurately the symp-. toms of his patient, all .of which pointed- distinctly to an affection of the liver, anud inqluired if the Carlsbad waters were well calculated to give his patient relief, giving, at the same time, the distinct intimation that nothing but the atsolute certainty of a cure would induce his patient to resort to that place. The young French physiciam, onleaving Berlin, proceecdud to Vienna and Pt agae, for the purpose of consulting further medical anthorities in Austria. In the latter part of last Juty the physician whom he had consulted here receivedl a costly snuffbox from Paris, with a few linest from - his Frenlh medical colleague, requesting his acceptance of it as a token of acknowledgment for bis professional advice; he would probably guess tor whose benefit the service had been asked, but the consultation had, he grieved to say, been unproductive of any result, for "our Emperor is restricted by political considerations even- ini the choice of a spa. A good deal of interestis excitedhere justnow bya deputation of Hun garian Protestants, whose ob ject is to raise sympathy and eventually to secure assistance for the cause of Protestantism in Hungary, described to be grievouslyjeopardized by the concordat in Austria.

I repeabt therefore, that,serious embarrAssment and injury wil b occasioned to foreign trade by forcing it out of its present safe and accustomed channels, in order to syread it overa number of small-and individuAlly insgafcaut-ztown, scattered over 'the banlms of the interior rivers; while its ,chief result would be to injure the larger cities at the mouth' of the Platei whereitis admitted that the wealth and comumerce; aud Iniay addthu intelligence and civfiization, of the whole country are centred. ' As totheresults of our diplomaev in the Plate hitherto your correspondent is silent, and limits his appkuse to the " enlightened" cou,rse that Her Majesty's Government are now pursumng. Every one whot,ikesan interest in those fine countries .nuss deeply regiet^th disiiiion between the city and pro.- 'vince of Buenos Ayres and the interior States; but it-ismost anjust-to.throw the whole blame of this on the Buenos Ayreans; and. -it -seims 'to ine anything but wise or prudent to takea apat in -the dissension, -and to lend all the weight' and influence of our diplo1-| macy to the side] of Gentral 'Urquiz&andthe Confedera- tion, ignoringaltogethertherights and _retensions of Bnenos | Ayres.

1OB1 COCKBURBYS MRORIALS O HIS. - I,.I3fE.Sy The "ftime ", of lord Cockburn was a very remarkable time, 'and -it occurred to him, as he him*self states, seivera, yearsi ago, that it' m-si to be e-: gre-tted th4t no private acco,Zut ;boiAd be preserved: of the distin'guished-inen or important events that bad marked the proa'res3s of SclhtlnAd,- or at least ,o- E.inburgh, ,duMnn his day.) i1.e had never 3made a smngle n-ot- with ,a-iler: . to such a recordc but about 1821. hi bega to re-I calk-et and inquiref Such is the account whichl -,m ho gives gE-the- o-ri<,ri-of his "Me-- -iorials,"- of whichins- execuf4rs, ias' weuuide'stand, *iL3iave published'.'that iion only,whicl. was written LJietween 1821. andthe- close of .1830, omitin -also ':from this the. characters of certt3in 'ehiinent. men, H eas H ry Er,skie and the.-frt lod 3elville, and the details of some'remmarkatbleevents, such as the establishment of the`Edinburgl Review, &c., '-vshich have been -already given to the world in 'ord COdckubin?s i:fe of Lard J rey; and on theacceptableness of this publication we can at lease say this,-his executors have given us, with all its -curtailments, one of .the few books of the season I which have any real substance. or originality in their pretensions. The Edisnburgh Berietv, with. its associatious, .which we put iaside, is, in virtue of some of iits * antecedents, part of our national story. It was the banner of a -lass movement, and what it accomplished we have heard abundantly from Lord Odekburn himself, and as agoreeably from others who, like Sidney Smith, had a larger share in the exertions by which it was-set on foot. But, if the IRe- viw were left-out of the question there remained a. collateral progress and memorable transition; in '-Scottish society; and there was concurrentlv a. literary, scientilic, and legal nucleus in the northern.-apital.which hiadunusual vitality, which displaied marked characteristics, and of which the memorials are exceedingly curious, and deserving this record. - Bor any one who immediately, or at. second hand, was locally acquainted with the celebrities of lord Cockburn's pages we can well imagine his Memorials will have a personal attractiveness which extends to.ourselves with remoter influence. Even - 'we, however, are impressed withl the distinctive attributes of the class of men whose memory he preserves, acd can admire the manly virtues and robust intercowse of worthies whose heads and stomachs, .on Lord Cock'oun's showing, must have *been equally above the average of the present generation. If we ascribe to Lord Cockburn's friendship some enhancement of their importance, and allow for Eome natural exaggeration of their public merits, there remaims sufficient evidence of the existence in his particular circle of a society of remarkable force, earnestness, and vivacity. Postponing for the present their public achievements, we find that they supped and soaked with the same energy and hardi-hood with which they discusseld metaphysical and politicalproblems. Their naturally dry and polemical spirits were so copiously Lubricated at friendly festivals that their tastes were tinged with the rich hues of claret,and their virtues have a strong aroma, derived from whisky-toddy. They may be aptly described in the language which Grammont applied to Lord Taaffe and the Duke of Richmond, as being " par-ticularly attached to each other, and still more to wine;" and this inclination, which we ascribe to their "caller air," may or may not be a commendable trait in the eyes of posterity, but there can be no doubt that it tended to heighten - their salient qualities, and to combine some unctuous graces with their angular developments. Like hedgehogs, they displayed their full proportions when wetted, and the knowledge of this circumstance we presume induced Lord Cockburn to make a prominent display of their convivial habits in conjunction with their public pretensions. There appears also to have been among them an - anunsial proportion of persons . whom we should describe as "characters" and. "eccentrics"-men whose peculiar bearing and habits were* in no ways softened by the facilities for assimilation which we enjoy in these days. The Edinburgh of Lord Cockburn's earlier . recollections was not the modernized cosmopolitan city it has become. It was more secluded and inaccessible, while it also contained a number of old places, usages, and institutions which foster local prepossessions, but which have since disappeared. Lord Cock-burn, in the passage we are about to quote, remarks on the decided influence also exercised by the long war in keeping society in. its ancient grooves, while it simultaneously intensified. and. developed all its vigorous peculiarities. He is speaking of the firstfew vyears of this century when hs says- "The society of 3dinburgh has never been better, or indeed so good, since I knew it as it was about tbis time. It continued in a state of high animation till 1815, or perhaps till 1820. Its brilliancy was owing to a variety of peculiar circumstances which only operated during this period. The principal of these were-the survivance of several of the eminen' men of the preceding age, and of curious old habits which the modern flood had not yet obliterated; the rise of a powerful community of young men of ability; the exclusion of the British from the continent, which. made this place, both for education and for re-idence, a favourite resort of strangers; the war, which maintained a constant. excitement of milita preparation and of militaryidlenessthe blaze of that poplAiteraturewhiehmadethisthesecona city in the empire for learning and science,; and the extent and the ease with which literature and society embellished each other, withoot rivalry and without pedantry. The first abstraction from this composition was by the deaths of our interesting old. Then London drew away several of our best yonu". There was a gap in the production of fresh excellence. peace in 1815 opened the long-closed floodgates, and gave to the continent most of the strangers we used to get. A new race of peace-formed native youths came on the stage, but vwth little literature, and a comfortless intensity of political zeal; so that by about the year 1820 the old thing was much worn out, and there was mo new thing of the same piece to continue or' replace it. 3Mrch urdonbtediy remained to make Edinburgh still, to those vrho knew how to use it, a city of Goshen, and to set us above all other British cities except one, and, in some things, above even that one. But the exact old thing wras not." There is no doubt as to the central figure in any man's recollections, and for this reasoni we begin with Lord Cockburn himself, though he modesly strives to keep his own person in thebackground. His portrait at the age of 40 gives us a pleasing impression of a clear and intelligent spirit, but we may doubt whether Lord Cockburn had ever the opportunity of bringing, into play all his varied capacities, while we know that his success and preferment in public life came late. He was the son of a gentleman who eventuallybecame a Baron of the Exchequer; and he-wasborn in] 779, though he is unable to say where. He went at the age of eight years to the High School of Edinburgh, of which Dr. Adam, of the Roman Antiqtities, -was then the head, and of ,vhich he had anythingibut grateful reminiscences. The latter is accounted j for -when-we learnthat out-of his four yesrs' attendance there were probably not ten days in which he was not flogged at lea-t once, that he never got a single prize, and once sat boobie at the annual public examaination. Dr. Adam is described as a laborious and tolerant teacher, and as absorbed in his vocation, as was singularly illustrated 'by his well-known dying words, "It is getting dark, boys; we nust 'put ofF the rest till to-morrow " but Dr. Adam's subordinates, -as young Cockburn's cuticle testified "were ruthless and indiscriminate, and kept him ina state of stupid terror. - He and some of his school'nates accordingly commemorated their final libera- tion from the hated tyranny by erecting a pillar snd depositing in a crevice a tin box filled with coins which he himself had to resuea 20 yeaTs later when. endangered by contiguous excavators. Brougham -and Francis Horner were at the High School Atuthe same time as himself, and Homer was dex. Of B-rougham Lord Cockburn tells the following anec- dote - Brougham vwas not in the class with me. Before gettiing - fto the rector's class he had been under Luke Eraser, who, ,- in hi two imMindatelY preceding curses of four years- c-ah, had the: good fortune to have Francis Jerey and'alter Scott as his pupils Brongham mado his first public explosion while at Frs's clara. I e dared to differ from ; Fraser, a hot but good-natured old fellow, on some e,isa'l -bit of ILtinity. The m,aster,like otheriueli in power, mIan- ,tmed his own' ifaUlllty, punished the rebel, and fiat- ee d himself that theaffairwas oyer. -Bt Brouhain re'nppeared nexct day, loaded wath ceolas, returnea to the , chatge bfore the whole clas, and compl,ed honest L"i to: acknowrledge tha he had bean wrongfJIUS made Brougha'm fanious throughout -the rwhole schoo 7. I remember, as we31 r .'35 if it bad been yesterday, haing-had him pointed out to me as 'the fellon' who-had beattlomaster.' ItwastCens I.t fatIfirst sawhi." - . - b m :It is remarkable, hoievier, thai- this story,- told 'vith so much circumstantiality, is d eLued, as we lar. informed, by lord Brougham himself, and we cea 2only account for this-by assuming that. tihe circii. -stance occurred on-the part of some other boy, andl .That Brougham, then prominent 'was by mistdke* made its hero.

Sidney Smithi sserted that le had overheard the Profebsoermitteri-ip one dark night in the street to himself,- "if it 'aid not been for that cofounded Solemn Ieague and Covenant we should have made as 'ood longs an.d shorts as .they." From1 Finlayson's lectures on logic Cockburn wras promot'ed to the moral philosophy class of Dugald Stewar~t, 'whose persobnal: qualification&-and inilluence over the mind of the wvriter.are set forth to our southera ears- in 'ternms somewfit'yeb- "He lectured standing, from notes which, with their successive additions, must, I suppose, at la:t have 'been nearly as full as his spokeis words, Eis lecturing -manner was professorial, but gentlemanlike; calm and, expository, but rnsing into greatne_, or softening into tencerress, wheaever bis smbect requirea it. A slght asthruitI6 iffection nnadebinm often clearhis throat; and sbh -was my .admira. tion of the -whole exhibition that Macvey Napier told himn not long ago, that I had- said.there was cloquence in b vry splittig. Then;' said he, 'I am glad there was at least one thins inwhich I had no competitor!- There are some, and those good judges, who have deo reciasted his lectures, on acnount of what they. call vaguen;ss, bywhich they mean the absence of strict,- aud, paraicailarly, of metaphysical reasoning, -which, they ti, made bis course evaratte in frittess generaldeclamatioR.' The real import ofts criticism is thatit was not prelections on the philosophy of morals that the critics desired. His g3e.tiity asdu -his indulgence in moral themes, which are whatthese hardhladed censors comiplainuof, constitutedthe'v-rycharm oi his course. A stronger-infusion of dry matter, ,especislly =etaphysical, - would have extinguisheu its 'magic.- The breadth and simplicdty of his -views might, not unnaturally, have made him appearsuperficial, to - those who did not undertsandhims. Bathieweo, eitherin thebudness of life or in the prosecuti6n o- philosophy, had occasionto recdr to princeples, always found that, either for study- or for-prac- tico, Stewart's doctrines were his surest guide. To me his lectureswere like the opening of the heavens. I felt that I had a soul. His noble 'views, -unfolded in glorioes sen-. tences, elevated me into a higher world. I was asmruch' cxcited and charmed as any man-of cultivated tas te would. be, who, after being ignorant of their existence, 'was admnitted to alltho gloriesof Milton, and Cicero, and Shakspeare. They changed my whole nature. In short, Degald Stewart was one of the greatest of didactic orators. ad-i he lived in ancient times his meniory would have descer-ded toius as that of one of the finest of the old- eloquen' sages.:- !But his lot was better cas Elourishing- in an age which irquires all the dignity of morals to counteract the tendencies of physical- pursuits and -political convulsion, he has exalted the character of his country and his generation. No inteligent pupil of his ever ceasedato respect philosophy, or -was ever false to his prmciples, witbout fee-ingthe crime aggravated by the recollection of the morality that Stewart had taught him." The teaching of Finlayson and Stewart forned- a fitting prelude to the academical and speculative societies in which Cockburn took part. -A this stage he recalls come of the amusements of his early days, which are indexes of the flight of time and the change in our manners. At the danringrooms in George-square so rigid was the etiquette that " lTo couple could dance unles each party was provided with a ticket prescibing the pzscise place in the precise dance. If there was no ticket, the gentlem anor the 'ady was dealt with as an intru der, and turned out of the dance. If the ticket had marked upon it-say for. a country dance, the figures 3.5, ibis meant that the holder was to place himself in the t7irddance,ar,ndifth from the top; and if he was anywhere else he was set right' or excluded; and the partner's ticket must correspond. WI on the hpor g Irl who, with ticket 2. 7, was found opposite a youth marked 5.9 ! It was flirting without a license, and looked very ill and would probably-be reported by the ticket director 6f that dance to the mother. Of comrsd, parties or paredri who wished tosecure dancing for 'themselves or those they hiad charge of provided themselves with correct and corresponding vouchers before the ball day arrived, This could only be accomplisher. through a director, and the election of a Pope sometimes required less jobbing. When parties chose to take their chance they might do so; but still though only obtained in the room, the written permission was necessary; and such a thing as a comnact to dance by - a couple without official authority would have been an outrage that could scarcely be contemplated. Tea was sipped in siderooms, and he was a careless beau who-did not present his partner with an orange at ths endof each dance; and the oranges and the tea, like everything else, were under exact and positiveregulations." The dinner regulations were -still more - rigorous and oppressive. The dinner hour,- after a series 'of iniovations, and protests5 and disputes, over each half-hour's advanca,.ranged at length between five and six. In the procession to the dining-room al the ladies first went -off. by themselves in a regular row, according to the ordinary rules of precedence. Then the gentlemen followed in a corresponding file, and when they also reached the diningf-room they found the ladies lingering abou-t the baemks of the chairis till they coulo learn Â£h.r fate by the gentlemen.'s selection- of partners. What followed is stated at somne length, but it is exceedingly curious as an evidence of the' social revolution accomplished in the last half-century: .- "Healths and toasts were special: tormenu-oppressions which cannot now be conceivedL Every glass dunng dinner required to be dedicated to the health of some one. It was thought sottish and rude to take wine without this, as if, forscoth, there was nobody present worth drinking vith.- I was present, about 1803, when the late Dnke of Bu,celeuclb took a glass of sherry by himself at the table of Charles Hope, then Lord-Advocate, and this was noticed afterwards as a piece of ducal contempt. And the person asked to take wine was not insited by anything so slovenly as a look, combined with a putting of the hand upon thebottle, as is practised by near neighbours now. It was a much more serious affair. For one thing, the wine was very rarely on the table. It had to be called for, and, in order to let the servant know to whom he was to carry it, the caler was obliged to specify his partner alond. All thisrequired some premeditation andcourage. Hence timid men never ventured on so bold a stepatall, butweregladtoescapeby only drinking when they were invited. As this ceremonywas a mark of respect, the landlord, or any other person who thought himself the great man, was generally graciously pleased toperform it to every one present; but he and others were always at libezty to abridge the severity of the dutyby pe$formng im r by platoons. -They took a braee, or two brace, of ladies or of gentlemen or of both, and got them al engaged at once, and proclaiming to the sideboard-' A glassof sherry for Miss Dundas, Mrs 3urray, and IMss tope, and a glass of port for Mr. Hume, and one for me,' he slew them by coveys. And all the parties to the contract were bound to acknowledge each other distinctly. Ifo nods, or grins, or indifference, but a direct look at the obect, the audible uttering of the very words,-'Your good health,' accompanied by a respectful inclination of the head, a gentle attraction of the right hand towards the heart, and a gratified smile. And after all these detachei pieces of attention during the feast were over, no sooner was the table cleared, 'and the after dinner glisses set down, than it became necessary for each person, following the landlor*,to drink-theheilthof.everyotherpersonpresent individually. Thus, where there were 10 people. there were 90 healths drunk. This ceremony was, often slurred over by the bashful, who were alowed merely to look the benedict on, but usage comp'plled them to look it distinctly, and to each indiaiduaL To do this well required some grace, and consequently-it was test done bythepoliterxaffiedandfriled gentlemen of the olden time. "- This prandial nuisance was horrible. But iit was nothing to what followed, for after dinner, and before the ladies retired, there generally-began what were called, rounds' of toasts, wheneach gentleman nam'ed an absent lady, and each lady an absent gentleman separat-ly-,;- br one-pe-son was required to give an -absent lady, and another person;vwn required to match a gentleman with that lady, and'the pair naraed were toasted, generally with-all-sions and j olces about the fitness of the union; and, woist of-all, there were-' sentiments.' These were short -epigrammatic sentences, exprensive of moral feelings and virtues, and were thought rehned and e'egant productions_-A. faint cwnception of their nauseousnes rnay be formed from the following examples, every one of which I have heard given a, thousand times, and whlich, indeed, 1- only recollect from. their beii^ favorites.

" Batu new genebration gradually laughed the sentiments awzy, so that at last one could only be got as a ciurosity from some old-fashibnedlpractitioner. They survivedlonger in iaale parties, especially of-a wild character.. Yet Scott, in presiding even at the grave annual dinners of the Bannatyne Club, always insisted ons rounds of ladies and gentle; men, and of authors and pt.intert,inets and kings, in regular pairs. Of course, in that toastmu. and loyal age, the Hing was never forgotten, even though the company con-' sisted only of the host and-his vife sd 'children;'" 'After- these elaborate' diniers Lord Cockburn 'nevertheless does not forget 'the suppers, -which were the favourite Edinburgh repast, and which he feelingly deplores as ." now fading.into paltry wino. and water." Earlydinners originaUy begat suppers, but the divines and metaphysicians of Lord Cock-' 'burn's circle, 'with' Rabelaisian facility of 'digestion, aiter the dinners had grown late, retauired the suppers still.' Lord Cockburn says all that can be said in their favour, quotes tho:-A ttio -examples of Lords HEermand and Monboddo, and dwells wvith especially tender unction upon the~ Sunday suppers of his 'frienid Sir Hienry Maoncrieff . " This most adcnirable and somewhat old-fashioned gentlemian was one of those who always dined between sermons, probably without touching wine. He then walked back-look at him-from his small house in the east end of Queen-street to hischurch, with his bands, his little cocked hat, his tall cane, and his cardinal air; preached, if it was his turn, a sensible practical sermron; walked home in the same style; took tea about .5, spent some hours in his study; at 5 hA family worship,at which he was delighted to see the friends of any of his sons; after which tho whole party sat down to the roasted hens, the goblets of wine, and his powerful talk. 'Herewasamode-of alluring young men into the paths of pious pleasantness" : Lord cockburm is particularly anxious to distinguish between thit "'pious pleasantness " and 'reli-. gloUs indifference, which so often neglects its liquor. Yet of Principal Robertson, whom, with other wor-. tbies of the olden generation; Lbrd Cockkburn dez' scribes, we hear, among other traits, that, though somewhat lax in his doctrine, "he struck us boys, even from the aide table, *as being evidently fond of a good dinner, at which heh sat.withhis chinne his plate, intent upon the real business of the occasion."" Of Lora Hermand, of whom the' writer speaiks as Ifan establishedwonder and delight," we are told, not only that he was fond of the pleasures, !Jld not.east '-he liuid ones, of the table, b-ut thqat " he hadacted in more of the severesb scenes of old Sdotch drinking than any man at last living." More'over, "ho had a serious:respect for drinyming indeed, a high moral approbation, and a serioui compassion for the poor wretches. who could aot indulge in it, with due contempt of those who could; but did not." The -cordi4lity inspired by claret and punch -was felt by hin as so- congenial to all righv thinking that " he was confident he could convert the Pope, if lhe could only get' him to sup with him." " And certainfly,". adds Lord Cockbiurn; " his Holiness would have beenhigd to phrsuade if lie could have withstoiod HEerniand about the-nmiddle of his second tumbler." An illustration of the severity with which in his judicial capacity he was .inclined to visi't any, offence against boon companionship is afforded by his strong charge against a prisoner who, when intoxicated, had stabbed his companion. The other'jadges were for letting him off easily, but Eermanids who felt that discredit had been brought on the ciause of drinking, had no -sympathy with the tenderness of-his' temipera7e brethren, .and wvas vehement for transportation.. "We are told," said he, "that there 'was no malice, and that the prisoner was in liquor. - In lHquor! Why, he was drunk! And yp he murdered the very man wvho had been drinking with him! They bad been carousin" the whole night. and yet he stabbed him, after drinlang a whole I bottle of rum -vithhim l Good God my Laards, if he will do this when he's drunk, what will he not do when he's sober?' - '. Lord Cockburn, who records these examples wvith appreciative humour and a sympathetic feeling, seeing that he confesses to have belonged himsef not exactly to the most severely absternious set in Edinburgh, couples Lord Hermand with another worthy, still more congenial, inasmuch as he was a consistent Whig. Again we muist leave hima to tell his own story "The Wigs had only one opportunity of snaking a Scotch judge, and they made Charles Ray, a man famos for law, paunch, whist, claret, and worth. His judicial title was Newton, but in private life he was chiefly known as ' The Mighty.' He was a bulky man, with short legs twinlding eyes, an large urple visae; nospeaker, but an excelent legal writer and adviser;` deep and accrate his law, in which he had. had extensive employment. Honest, warmhearted, and considerate,.he was tianys true to his principles and his friends. Bnt these and other good qualities were all apt to be lost ight of in people's admir5tion ot his drinkng. is daily and flowing cups'raised him far above the evil days of sobnety on whic: he- bhad fallen, and made him worthy of having quaffed wvit)i the Scandinavian heroes. Bet there was io noise .in his 'libations, no boisterousness, no wrangling, not even dispuitation. Te kindly stillness of his ordinary manner,, instead of bein' disturbed, was deepened by potation, .and a cask so well seasoned was not liable to be nflamed by. anything so feeble as intoxication. Hisdelight was to sit smiling, quiet, and listening, saying little, bht that 'little-always sensible, for he used to hold that conversation, at least when it was of the sort that excites admiration, spoiled good company-;: sated apparently with enjoyment, and only disturbed when he observed some unfortunate creature at -table not, taking as many or as full bumpers as himself. "He was the modern ing of th'e Ante-Maanum Club-a j0vial institution which contained, and helped to kill, most of the eminent topers of Edinburgh for about G0O years preceding the year 1818, when the degenerate temperance of the age at last destroyed it. When the Mighty died, the members dined, and did not, fail to. drown their sorrow in solemn mourning, each drinking -a full glass to the memory of their departed chief, and bowing reverently to his portrait, which they had,hungup in the tavern which had long been his field of fame. Jeffrey, -Moncreiff,'Keay,'Murray, I and sonme other of the younger and less worthy spirits, joined this once famous association,* a few years before it expired, merely to have a glimpse Qf the last age. It was curious, but to us dull. Few of them had heads for talk, and none of us for much wine, We had to "et the esta blished jokes and other humours explained; and they were not quite at ease under our intrusion. There were no High Jinks, or sprightly sayings or songs; bat a good deal of kindly personal bantering, iaughing at nothing or at very little, and steady quiet draughts of claret. But I believe there was a great deal of wild animation ir the.youthof the club when its pulse was quicker. Bermand's star blazed in this hemisuhere for at least half a pentury, when the meetings were every Friday for about six or seven months yearly. He used very often to go. direct from the club to the court on the Saturday mornings. When. some of us degenerate youths were once protesting against more wine he exclaimed mournfully, 'What shall we come to at last9 I believe I shall be left alone on the face of theeatthdrinking claret!'' From these worthies we proceed toJudge Newtor, -amanu of deep potations and gret bulk, and who was slumberous in society and in court, though not to the prejudice of the Queen's lieges "lis management of this judicial inconvenience was very curious. In court his head generally rested either on his heaving chest, or on his hands crossed on the bench, while, after getting a grip of the case, his eyes were locked in genuine sleep. Yet, from, practice and a remarkably quick ear and mtellect, nobody, could., say anything worth hearing without his instantly raising hishuge eyelid, ard keeping it open, and directing his powerful knowing eyo 'likes mortar at the speaker tillh be; got what was neceasaryafter w;hch, when the' babbling began, do`wnr.s*nk tie eyelid again till lighted up-by-the next shot. The only way to waker. him wa to say, something'good, and this never f railed; accordingly, no judge ever knewi his cases better." In short, to conclude on this aspect of Lord Cock- buri's MemorWols, it appears 'to se the sumn of his.; experience that good liquor te'nds to clesr a miIan's intellect, and thsat the source of iti1ae, a agre john Falstaff, is to " forswear thin potations." There is, a further characteristio of, Lord Cockburn which influenced himn more largely, but which seems 'scarcely to accord with his convivial 4mnpa thies. That modificatioi of a love of old port wine which has been describedas the sentiment of attachmeit to Church and Queen was by no means to his liking. Though he' wasa-born iind bred among the Tories, he was a stanch and determined Wlhig. He 'was more, tar more, than we fnean by a Whig i7 these days, for it is obvious that he participated ig their early isolation and disgusts, and put forth the' crude fruits which grew out of 'that :sharp culture; But there is no denying- at this day that he had reason for his rigorous politics,;and that hceLas amply set forth the grounds of the attitude which 'he and his friends assumed and "consistently maintained. Es Meemmoids are thui'in the main a vindication Of his party, and'his reminiscences are 'eiployed to put their case in the moit; favouable' light at the bar.of posterity. 'That their grievances were many and substantial is now made amply evident. Frm meriai ciruim'stances peculiar to Scotand thaey were, :in faet; minore substantial than we in England were aware of, When Lord Cockbum in 1800 entered the -Faculty of Advocates, and " with a feeling of nothingnessj paced'the' Outer house," the passions and appreN hensions excited by the FrenchTRevolutionhad converted the island into a camp, and its public opinion had; -as it were, the cogency of Â±ntial law to sup-' press disaffection and stife all complaint. 'Yet thei -heaviest* causes of complaint existed in the Northern kingdom, where one party not only engrossed al the ..official rank and-influence of the country,- but had their adversaries absolutely at their 'merey. Institutions there were, in faft, -none, in any popular sense.. ' There was no popular: representation- all .t9wn-councils elected- the-selveI; persons were sent to the court as jurymen very- nearly according t4 the discretion .of the -heriff .of their conty; aud after they got--hefe -those who were-- to try the, prosecution were .picked-for thai duty bythe ie siding Judge, unchecked by.-any pIy remto.. - lenge. "fn other words," says Lord: Cockburn, "we had no freepolitical institutions.whatevei.' There were few newspapers, nor was the abs6hce of a free pnublie press compensated - by any freedom of public speech. "PPublic pohtical.: meetings could not arise, for tlie elcinentsdidnotexist, Idoubtif there wasone during the 25 years thatsucceeded the year 1795. _2Nothing.was viewmed vith sach horror as any.politicalcongregation not friendly to existing power.

The community, says Lord Coclkburn, conssted of " a people' that iws prostkate, a- fev brave' but powerless iidividual and an'overwhelmingfactioiu," &c. It will, perhaps, ever be a questioi whethei the people and the factioin were- not at. this momebnt identical; but,: at-all events, there can be no doiibt that the position of -the sincere Whigs was iimost unfair and irksome.- Lord Cockburn states ' g6me remarkable facts in- iltustration of this.: At their dinner on Fox?s birthday, where.the partyvwas most select, rarely exceeding a- dbzen-or two of the m-ost discreetand eminentVainong them, they were rarely allowed to asemble vwitbout sheriffs' officers bein sent to take down -the naies of those -who 1enteed. 'A witten test, was presented -. the young 'Wig - lawyers, . and their:refualto subscribe it almost x- cluded them 'from -practice. Re3nry Erslune, ghe brig,htest ornament of the profession, for presiding at a meeting to petitQn against the: war was.turned out ef his office of-.Dean of the Faculty; of Advocates. - The Sedition Trials of 1793 1 And 1794 recailed for a-parallel "the-days of Lauderdale aud Dalzel ;" and. personal bitterness peaetrated everywhere, spreadingagangrene throughout society. Lord Cockburn -fairly asks, "If Dugald Stewiaxt was-for several years not cordially.received in the city he 'adorned, -what :must- have been the position of an ordinary-m=an who held' liberal dpipnions in the- country or in a small-town, opestoiall the contumely and obstrtiction:t;hat local insole,ce could practise, and -unsupported by any a9sociate cherishing kindred thoughts '" the WhiWg barristirs, of wshom Cockburn himself- was one, w.ere not only, as we said,excluded from practice;but were separated into a sect of-their own, and "there:was aparticular place-at the northend of the Outer Rousewhich was- the knownhaunt of -these doomed youtls." This sect included Jeffrey, Brougham,: r i, Horner, &c., and in.the spirit iL which they were generally proscribed Jeffrey was not allouved to report the proceedings of his own court. His consequent leisure was retributive, for it was ond fi the proximate causes bf the first appearance of the' ]3d.istbtti7t R'4-iew. :. . - Apart fromn these professionaL cadets thi-re was nowhere any sign of -independence. The citisens were mute and submissive.- The town-council' of Edinburgh might have been -sitting in Venice. Like other bodies of the same class, it may be said that "no 7ariety of opinion- disturbed its unanimity. for the pleasure of Dundas vas the sole rule for every one of them." Any semblance -of disaidence was stummarilysuppressed. i *Certain of the support of the ProcbnsuL, whom they no morethoughto9fthwartingtan of thwarting Providence, timidity was not one of rtheiryvice,. Aboutthe year 1799 a solitar schsm amazed the public, by disclosing the incredible fact that the town-council- might contain -a membes who had an opinion of his own. A councillornained Smith electrified the city by a-pamphlet; shoving tbat the burgb was bankrapt. Time h9s put it beyond all doubt -that he was right; andfortpnato -would it have -been for the city and its creditors if this -had been acknowledged at the time, instead of being aggravated byyears of subsequent extrivagance and concealment. -Bub his tebellion hrove Mr. Smith outiof theplace." A g,ood example of the arbitrar manner in which public officers dealt.-with the people .is afforded in the case of a M]r. Laing, a -clerk. of the samne towvn council, wvho seems to have transported persons at his absolutie discretion. . i " For example, about the year 1795 mdx or eight baker WEdE of good ci.racter and respectable, though humble, parient age, being.a little jolly one night, were making a noise ir the street. This displeased fr. Iaing, who had A notior that nobody could be drunk with safety to the pmblic ex cegt himnte , so he had-the Uds apprehended; and as th di not appearin the mo ning,theirfriends became alarmed and applied to -r. (afterward Sir Henry) Jardine,azesldo partisan of Goveriment, who took an iiterest in the fainily of one of them. 3r. Jardine toldme that next moninun he inquiredabout them, when TIing toldhimthat he needgive himself no trouble, beciuse 'they are all beyond Inchkeitb by this time.' And so Ithey were. He had sent them on. board a tender lying in Leith-roads, -which he knew wa -to sail that morning. This was done by his own authority, without a conviction, or a charge, or an offence." Lord Cockbiurn,- with reference to-the first moving of the waters which gradually upheaved this 'oppressive r4girne, recalls a-remark of the quiet and observant Playfair, that it seemed to him that 'the whole cause of independence in Scotland hung upon the characters and the exertions of about hal-adozen young men in the Parhament-house. To what an extent Scotland, and incidentally the British empire, were indebted to these Lord Cockburn goes onto record. How slow and painful were the steps, how long-deferred was the fruition of a change such as the times required ! The reform commenced in 1S00 with the removal of an obvious evil in the system of the town infirmary, by the appointment, for the first time, in opposition to the managers, of a resident medical officer. Theestablishment-of the Comnercial Bank helped to further the impulse to the better administration and control of their own affairs by the citizens. The gradual introduction and operation of redeeming -aircuimstances went on to illustrate " by the example of-a single place the general- principles which- regulate the improvement of the world." And change succeeded change, success alternated with defeat. until the national excitement.of 1830 gave Lord Cockburn's friends, in a comprehensive sense, a most conclusive victory. In dwelling on their long depression and ultimnate elevation we have perhaps-somewhat lost sightof Lord Cockburn himself, but it' is really oinDg to the modesty of which we have spoken, and -which induces him to merge his own case intheirs, and to interest us in the personal fortunes and performnances of others. Nevertheless, we ought not to omit one circumstance which redounds greatly, to the credit of Lord Cockburn's consiatency.. So tFue was he to his party principles that when, inlSO65 he was unexpectedly made Advocate-Depute by the Tories, owing to his father's political connexion with that party, he objected to take -the office,-on the ground that his opinions were not those of the Goyernment, and was only induced to. do so after consulting with his friends and obtaining an uner-. standing that no political obklation was implied; and when, four years afterwards,' he-was dismjssed on the ground that ha"ad voted against the Lord Advocate at a meeftiiig of the Faculty, he declaes, and.-we believe him, that. he. "never -felnt ore - relieved than on getting rid 'of 'a connexion which had all along been more than-half compulsory, aid nevercomfortable." His:deprivation on this occasion was properly comp ensated by 'aiparty equivalent, when, in theultimate division of spoll by the victors, he was enabled tosay, ff I closc thin page yi b in- that Jefirey. has- beerr" -iade Lord-Advocate and, I Solicitor-General under-the Ministry of Earl Grey"' at which point, with, a sort of dramatic ap7omb theMemorials for the -present conclude.

THE CASE OF HEPNRY COBJS DA UGHTEBRS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TflES. Sir,-If the request for a- furthen- brief space in your columns is not an encroachment on the kindlness which insertd my late letter, I am anxious to state a few particaaI which 'besides their connexion with the claimsi of the individual suifferers in the Cort tragedy, have a con sider. able nublic interest. It is, perhaps, little known to those it most concerns-the recipients ofsemallpenzions-that out of the pttanceordered in their original warrants 7l1 per cent. has bleen commnonly abstracted to -'id in paying the interest of several milions borrowed to dischag the private debtsofi George L and George II. A farhe benevolence of 5 per cent, was claimed for Westminster landl-tax, though it is difficult to discern the connexion between this impost and a grant of charity to deservn persons in some distant part of the kingdom. Under the shadowy title of Exchequer fees a further exhaustion of 71 to 121 per e-nt. depletes the Crown *gift 20 to 25 per cent. altogeWler belowr the nominal bounty -surely a strange series ofrarrangements for distributing the charities of a great nation, especially the last, which intro. ducedl a poor penimoner on thae official scene as a prize or booty to gladden the res capuglc of, we must presuime, the underpnid servants of the State. How should wve seaker think of a private gentlemen who had a charity to dipes and hagained to e'ke out his butler's and porter's wages by abstractons of twopences and threepences in the shiling l But it must, I conceive, be stil less known that the acts lof Parli-menet establis'hing these deductions from pensions andl salaries on the civ i lit exempt all pensions less than 100!. s-year, and all of the nature of charitable donations, wbatever the amount ; and yet it is the incredible fact that these exemptions have not only not been attended to, but that the smallest charities have been subjected, to the heaviest fines. 'When, upon the appeal of 16 bankers, mnerchants, and members of Parlaiaent, Mr. Pitt relieved the distress of Henry Cort by a pension of 2001. a-ye-ar, in 1794, five years after the national benefactor had been pillaged by that Minsister's bosom friend, this bounty, both in t'he petition andl in t'he grant, was especially characterized as a charity, yet the disobedientandinexorable official sponge wiped 'away 401. yearly. On his preumature decease, in 1800, ,apenshion of 125!. was continued to Elizabeth Cort, his widow, Dn the report of the Controller [of the Navy (Sir Andrew Hammond) that. herself and orha family were truly objects for national relief. This, srely was a charity; yvet 100!. only was paid to her, flying in 1816, two pensions of 25!. Gs. each were accorded to two unmarried dalighters, and then, as if violation were the very rule of office, these pensions, -which possessed the double claim to exemption of bth conditions, being both charities and less then 100!. a-year, wero taxed with increased deductions;- 191. per annum only has been paid on each. The charity roll of the :British em ire has taken public credit for 12. 12s. yearly which it di& not pay, end the sign manual of its Sovereign stood before, the world for 40 years at a discoDunt of more than 25 per cent.!I It is difficult to trace the comimencement or the final erection of these Mlegalities. Necessitous recipients needing these small sums were prohably in no position to maake complaint, even had they Imown thei4gnevance. The expensfve remedy p3rovided in the respective acts-petition to the lla-ons of the Exchequer-was likely to swallow up the whole instead of a part of the pensions; it might be natural to fear that a pension granted during pleasure could be cancelled by displeasure, and thus the poor, who could least afford the imposition, were only too gladl to tak-e what they could get out of a gift. From documents attached to the report of a select committee on pensions, 1808, (reprinted 182) at appear that the clumsy device for diltenag sub road certain charges byv deduction out of other charges had led to infinite'troubles and irregularities. rater alia it is reported that numierous officers who were mn a position to help themselves had habitually paid to themselves their pensions or salaries in faul for so lung a period that their utter ruin would have been the consequence of the :Exchemjer surcha g them with the deductions legally due. The grat fishs having broken throgth e.f law,the ersm -fy of poor unsioners wvere, reousate, nfetofy grilled to mak-e good the deficiency7.

At that time a nominial change* wae maade to remove the scandal and inconvenience of such complicated intricacy, but a rela,tion of the steps takenx to render illeal deduactions permanent in the face of new acts of Fals scent declaring their abolition, and which are still moreunconceivable than the previous irregularity, would double the length of this already too long letter. Should you consider its details of sufficient public importance to warrant their insertion, connected Ps they are with the moitendulscientific and commercial facts in the world's history, I sell then presume to trrouble you with the conclusion of the story.

THe AG;;mowE.-An extraordinary meeting convened by some of the inmates of "the Abode of Love' at Bridgewater, was held a few days ago at the Clarence Hotel. The RPev. S. Starkey, G. R. Thomas, and J. Cohl attended from the Agapemone, and several of their followers were also present. The Rev. S. Starkey in a slow and lmpressive manner set forth the "principle2s of this deluded sect. One passage of his address is sufficient to show the blasphemous nature of their creed. hlr. Starkev said, " The Son of Man bath so loved the earth that he hath given is zown Spirt, that whosoever believeth in EHim shaU tot die, hnt be live, and abide the coming of the Prophet. Behold He comethI If any man believeinH}im he isa new. creature; old things have passed away-all things are become now, TheSonof Manwas in theHolyGhostreconlin, the flesh unto himsself, and hath given unto Brother P-ince the ministry of reconciliation. K'ow, then, I am the mes. ESnger of the HolV Ghost unto you. The Lord of Hosts camo and sent and proclaimed that the day of grace was pase, and the Gosp2elaispensation ended; and, thus left, the world and the professing church were like Ephraim of old when he said, 'Lot him alone.'

It appeared that the " cottons" of the defendants, as well as those of the plaintiff's employers, were warehoused in a uarehouse in Liverpool, called Bnrm's Fonndry, and so placed that a gangway was left b-etwveen the piles of. cotton, to enable the worm%en to pass and re-pass ; and upon the 7th of June last the p,aintiff was passing along the gangway about 1 o'clock, when a eervant of the defendants, named Kelly, being on the top of the pile, threw down a bale into the gangway, wathout, as the plaWtiff insisted, giving any warning whatever. The balo fell upon the plaiatiff, knocked him down, and iflicted the serious injury complained of. Upon the part of the defendants it as distinctly assertedthatKelly had giventhe usual wVarning, and further, that he was not acting as the servanb of the defendants at that time, being there without any authority from them, inasmuch as he had not been directed by their foreman to resune hiswork afterthe dinner hour.

The ship went out and anchored accordrag to usage off the bar of the river Benin on the coast of Africa, and a great part of the cargo was sent by tenders to the plaintiff's factory up the river, where a portion of it was bartered for palm oiL On the 3d of March, 1853, while the ship was off the river, a fre occurred at the factory, destroying the cargo which had been landed from the ship, and also a quantity of palm oil which had been purchased with it by barter with the natives, and which had not yet been sent on board the ship. The plaintiffs sought to recover on the policy at the rate of 651. 10 per cent. on the loss thus sustained, and also for loss of freight from the river Bonny occasioned byaninjurythevesselhadsustained on her ontward voyage,which prevented her taldng on board so large a cargo as she otherwise would have done. The defendants contended that the goods burnt had been safely landed 'within the meaning of the policy, and that the palm oil destroyed had notbeen on board, and was not insured. They aslo contended that freight could not be recovered on goods which had never been on board the ship. They contended that the policy did not cover the cargo or the oil in the factory. Several vitnesses were called to prove the usage and custom of the African trade, as to bartering outward bound goods for a return cargo, and the facts having been agreed upon, A verdict was entered for the defendant, with leave reserved to the plaintiff to move to enter a verdict for him non obstante reredicto on the issues raised.

He was seized by another man and gTen into my custody. I found upon him a silver watch and guard, three rings which he wore on his fingers, and Ss. in silver. When charged with the robbery he mnade no answer, and refused his address. After the usual caution, the prisoner was asked whether he wvished to say anything in answer to the charge, upon whichhe replied that he should reserve his defence till his trial took place. He was then fully commnitted to the Central Criminal Courtt Henry Clark, a soldier belonging to the 77th Foot, was charged, upon his own ccnfession, with being a deserter. Henry Trinder, city officer, 587, said that as he was on duty the previous evening a corporal of the Grenadier Guards brought the prisoner to him and said he wasadeserter and had given hinself up to him. The prisoner having admitted the statement to be true, the officei tookz him into custody. In answer to Alderman WIBE the prisoner, who exhibited a Crimean medal on his breast, said he deserted from his regiment in June last. The prisoner was remanded, in order that the authorities at the War-office might be communicated with. In the case of Fossey and Neary, reported in our impres;ion of yesterday, through atypographcal ezrror the amount of baii fixed bythe Lord M'ayor is stated to have been " themaselves in 00. and two securities in 251. each," instead of "themnselves in 500l. and two securities in 2501. each." The LOoD MAsYon requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of 11. from " J. F. V." as a donation to the poorbox. Bow-sTvnr.-A private in the Coldstream Guards, named James Orpin, appparently about 50 years of age, and having upon his breast a Crimean medal and four clasps, besides three good conduct stripes upon the sleeve of his uniform, was brought before Mr. HALT, charged with ,attempting to commit suicide on Sunday -morning by jump. ing from a steamboat into the river Thames. It appeared from the evidence that while Inspector Thomas, of the Thames Police, was on duty at the stationgalley near the Adelphi-pier, at about half-past 9 in the morning, he saw the defendant go on board the halfpenny steamboat Endeavour, ran across the deek, throw off his leather belt, and jump into the river. The inspector immediately caDLed his men to the oar and proceeded to the spot, where they caught defendant's body with the boathook, and succeeded in getting him into the boat. The defendant remained breathless for some little time, and then calLed to the crew to let hint drown, exclaiming earnestly, "Oh, let me drown, pray let me drown ! I did not know you were so near me." Ee th nmade several attempts to throw himself in again, Strugviing very hard with the men, until the insetor threateuejtohand cuff him if he did not remain qmet. On being asked what motive he could have for destroyinghis life he repfed " My wife, my dear wife, whom I loved so truly, has left me." He was then taken to Bow-street. I The colour-sergeant of the regiment, a fine stalwart fellow, also wearing the Crimean medal and clasps, here stepped 'orward and informedthe magistrate that defendant, who had been on duty throughout the late campaign, was a most efficient soldier, and bore an excellent character. He had sent home a great deal of money to his wife during his absence in the Crimea-more, perhaps, than any other man in the battalion; and when, onreaching home again, he handed her every penny of his savings she suddenly absconded from him, having, it Vwas believed formed an adulterous connexion wwith another man daring her husband's absence. - - - The defendant, who seemed painfuly aCected, sid ha was fully sensible of the wrong he bad committed in a moment of bitter anguish, and assured his worship thatif he would overlook the offence this time it should never be repeated. He had livedhappily with his wife for 14 years, and her sudden desertion now, without any conceivable ca e,was so great a shock to him that it wasalmost more than he conld bear. Mr. HIA1 .-Are there any children 1 Defendant.-None now living, your worship; Mr. H&LT.-That is a fortunate thing for you. You appear to be a mo-' respectable man as well as a brave soldier, and you may depend upon it that she is whollY unworthy of you, You, as a soldier, ought not, to waste a single tear upon a woman who has proved herself so ungrateful-so utterly worthless. Inspector Thomas stated that the wife's mother and sister were in court, but they knew nothing of her. The mother, a decent-looking woman, here Came as to the witness-boxweepmig bitterly. She said the defendant had been a very gO husband to her daughter, and she was wholly at a less to account forher unfeeling conluct towards him. She had never known them to quarrel. They lived together, on the contra_y, most affectionately Mr. HALL inquired if there was any one to look to him until his mind became calmer and more settled 5 Defendant.-Take myword, your worship, I will not attempt it again, I had better go to the banacks. That willbe the place for me. I had leave, ae a married man, to live out of barracks. But now I must go biak. Let me go with the sergeant. Eventually the defendant was given up to the sergeant, who undertook to look after bim for the present. The case excited much commriseration in court. fAR=0oROUGcusTERPz.-Mary Ann Routledge, a very young woman, was brought up fer final examiniation before Mr. BE/- QOn, for havin" attempted to commit sicide.

In the last session the Great Northern Railway Compay assented to the insertion of powers to enable them to sIbscribe 175,0001. in the capital of this company. and to enter into trasEic amrngements. Negotiations thereupon ensued between the two companies, which are still inpro. gress. Thearrangementwhichhasbeen ubliclyannouncecbetween certain of the shareholdersandSr.JJ. Ricarao,MLP., has insured the distribution of a large number of shares held by those gentlemern during the late monetary crisis7 which tended so much to weaken theposition of tho company. The directors have elected thsat gentleman chairman of their boar4, but they regret that a severe attack of illness has hitherto prevented him from taking upon himself the active dauties of that office. The directors have entered into a contract to complete the works for a fixed sum, which will- inw elude-allcontingencies connected withroa4s, sewers, water and gas pipes, and other similar items. The shareholders have nowT the assurance that a double line of mixed gauge from Paddington to the.Post-office can be omrpleted 'vithin the company's available capital. The directors bave secured the right of purchasing a larg area of tho vacant land abutting on. the nenw street leading from arnngdon-street. Rlegard being had to the position of the land, its shape and extent, the cost at which it has been obtained, and its importance to the larger railway companies with which it is intended to connect the MIetropolitan, this acquisition must be deemed of. great value. -The capital account shows that 123,148L has been received, and 39,1731. expended, leaving a balance of 71,2501. in the hands of the Accountant-General, and 12,725 at the bankars.' SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE The half-yearly meeting of this company was held atI lichfield yesterday. Mr. R. C. Chawner presided. The C EOaA n, in moving the adoption of the repor observed thatthe principal expenses incurred during the last half-year had been in the constraction of the new branches, or lawcharges, andlandandcompensation. TheirlawbiUls amounted to 3,6361, and land and compensation to 9,36& A great expense had likewise been incurred at the Dadley and Browiills stations in consequence of the great increase of traffic. Their line of railway, he was happy to say, was in good condition, and the tenns of their lease to Mr. m'lcan had been fully complied with. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Payn, two of their directors, had gone over the line and ened everypoint requiing investigation. Thosegentle. men bad recommended the appointment of arbitrators to settlesomemattersindispute, and the board had deter. mined to adopt their sugestion. Mr. JoYnsox seconded the motion. Mr. JETsoN called attention to the absence of any revenue account. They ought to have a full statement of the rents received, the balance in hand of unpaid dividends, ho. Perhaps the chairman would explain how it was that uch an account was not published, and ree that the proprietors were furnished with one on future occasions. The CUAxaas thought Mr. Jesson's suggeosion a valuable one, and saw no reason why the account should not be published. The account, however, was on the books of the company, si"ned by the auditor, and could be consulted by any harehoijer. As, however, they were coming to the end of their capital acecount ho saw no objection to publish a revenue account every half-year. Mr. FORSTER, M.P., complained of Iichfield being "an out of the way place ;" and, as Walsall was the birthplace of the South Staffordshire Railway, recommended that the future meetings of the company should be held in that town. Alter some further conversation, the matter wvas left with the directors, upon the understauding that the next half-yearly meeting should be held in Birmingham or WalisaIll The inconveniences to which passengers on the South Staffordshire Railway were subjected at the Wichnor junction with the Midland near Burton-upon-Trent were next made a subject of complaint by several proprietors. They were frequently kept hours upon their journeys, and it was highly desirable that some better communication should bo effected between Wichnor and Burton. Mr. P. DYoLL thought the time was come when they ought to know whether the London and North-Weterm were the allies of the South Staffordshire Company. The CAiRmvAsn was glad the subject had been mentioned. Me had always considered the Wichaor junction a weakr point with the Staffordshire Company. At the present time he would not enter further into the question. It was a most imporhant subject, and would not be lost sight of by the directors.

The report of the directors of this company states that the lie from Usk to the juncetion with the Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford Railway, four miles in iength, was op-ned on the 2d of June last, and byarrangement is worked by that company. The weekly returns up to the present time are as favourable as can be expected. The section of the line from Usk to Monmouth, 12 miles in length, is in a forward state, and wil be ready for opening in the spring of next year. It was estimated by the directors that, if the traffic on the line to Monmouth should oniv amount to 151. per mile perweek, it would pay a dividend apon its cost at thu rate of 5 per cent. per annum, allowing 50 per cent. for working expenses. WHITEHAYTEN, CLEATOR, AND EGREMONT. The accounts of this company to the 30th of June iast show that the total amount oi capital authorized by act of Parliament to be raiRsed is 66,6001-50,0001. in shares, and 16,600W by loans. Of the shares the sum of 47,9371. has been paid up, while of thel6,6001. to be raisedby loans the company have borrowed 15,3001., making, to the above date, in cluding interest and transferfees, 63,702?. On the disbursement side of the capital account appears a total of 62,0571. leaving a balance in favour of the company of 1,6441. With the exception of some accommodation for passenger traffic the line is completed. The Government inspector passed over it a fewdays ago, andreported favourably of its general construction, butitrequired the erection of several additional signal posts, amidhe construction of some new sidings before certifying it for passengers. These matters are being attended to, but it will bO some weeks yet before they can be completed. The entire length of the line is about nine miles, and the cost of construction has been within the original estimate. The line was opened for the conveyance of iron ore on the 8th of January last, but for some weeks afterwards the quantity conveyed over it was comparatively smalL Inorderto insure despatch and disinish cost of transit, many of the iron ore Proprietors are constructing branch lines to their works, Considering that the line has not been worked during the whole of the half-year, the revenue has realized tho expectations of the promoters. The total receipts on revenue account amount to 3,5101., and the expenditure to 1,7381, leaving a balanoe of 1,7721. The directors purpose recommending a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. Since the opening of this line for mineral traffic, the weekly receipts on both the Whitehaven Junction Railway and the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway have increased more than 30 per cent. as compared wlth the receipts of corresponding vweeks last year. SEHREWSBURY AND WELSHPOOL. The first ordinary meeting of this company was held yes. terday at Shrewsbury. The Earl of Powis presided. The secretary (Mr. R. S. France) having read the notice. convening the meetine, T=boetRSMrAIs congratulated- the shareholders on the suecese thatlhad attended their application to Parliament for an act authorizing the construction of. the line after a very long and tedious opposition in both Houses of Parliament. The Parliamentary oppoeiEion, though technicaLly th at of landowners along the line, appeared from the s,peeches of ospposing counsel and the nature of the cross-examination to lsaveheencondnctedon " the large scale of the breed gauge." As no evidence w/as called in either House of Parliament on behalf of landownrn.s as to the in,iury that w.ould he done to their several properties by the making of the line, he hoped that now the act had passed they would be disposed to meet the company iu a conciliatory spirit; and as far as the company: was concerned, he believed it to be the duty of the directors to meet the landowners in a liberal mauner. Heregrtte that aclause had been struck out of the bill for mriking arrangements with the Oswestry and Nfesetown Company, and he hoped that before the line wvas completed an opportunity would oceur fedapplying to Parliament for those powe:s. The 'shareholders would agree with himn that the more intimate the connesion existingbetween the two cornpanies the more likelythey were to have a decent dividend. Hehadtoregret the postponement of the consideration of the accounts until the next hall-yearly meeting, aws there had not been sulfficient time since the passing of the act to prepare a statement of the preliminar and raliamentary expenses, The secretary then read the repcort, which stated that the p resent directors retired from office and offered themselves for re-election. -The act aulthorized the election of 10 zdirectors, and the board recommended that their numnberbe increased to 10. The hoard recommended that the saLary of the secretary-be fixed at 2501. per annum, They recommended that M. Robert Owen and Mr. H. B.

An act was passed in the last session of Parksment for the constraction of a railway from Dunmfries to Castle Douglas, being a consderable portion of the line required to connect Dumfries with Portpatriclr. Surveys of the remainder of the line are now in progress, and an at, itishoped, ill be obtainediiuthenext sesson of Parliament authorWiing its completion to that port. NlEWRY AND ENISKILLEN. The report of the directors of this company states that, in the present peculiar position of the line of this compay, it is far too short to be worked 'with economy or advantaNe, or with any prospect, in its present position, of its paying a dividend; ancuthey unanimouslyrecommend that a junction shall be formed with the Warrenpoint Company, provided that company are disposed to contribute their proper share towards the expense of doing so, and then to lease their line on favourable terms to this company. The expense of effecting this junction will be of comparatively small amount, while an immense amount of saving in the wording expenditure of the line will be thereby effected, and the company, by this means, have the advantage not only of the sea, but of one of the finest ports on the eastern coast of Ireland. The directors are also of opinion that the le of this company should be extended inland to Armagb. provided reasonable arrangements can be entered into with the landowners along the line, and provided, also, that material and pecuniary support and assistance are given by the merchants, &c., of *Newry and A rmagh towards effecting an object in which they themselves have a direct interest. A puAlic meeting, at which the directors attended, was in MIay last held in Newry, and apledge given that, on certain terms, 48,0001. would be raised in ewry, Armagh, and elsewhere, towards effecting this object. The directors intimated to the parhes locally interested that, previous to taking any steps in the matter, they would require a bon4 flds share list of proprietors to be forwarded to them, They have since ascertained that the most lieral support for the extension of the lime to Armagh would be afforded by Colonel Close and the other landed proprietors alongthe lhe. The accounts for the half-year endingthe 30th of June, 1856, show that the receipts on account of capital amount to 3,721., and the payments to 5,4431. The receipts on account of traffic amount to 800, and the payments to 994. With reference to the small balance against the company on revenue account the directors deem it of no importance, the same having arisen from the Dayment of thebalance due to the superintendent, to the 31st of December, and the sam of 601. lOs. paid into court in dischae of al arger claim made on the company F. Spackman, jun, both cf which were. properly chargeable to the revenue account for the prevous half-year; from the fact of a reduction of rates after the opening of the Dab3in and Belfast CompFany's stabion, and from the further fact of there not being, till withi a Tery recent period, any waiting-rooms for the rcception and accommodation of pass<engers at the terminus of this company. The average wvee3ly receipts are nOwY above 40'., which more than pa-ys the expenses. A juction with the Warrenpoint Railway would materially conduce to a still further reduction in the working expenses, and enable both lines shortly topsy adividend. Thedirectorspropose to apply to Parliament an the next session for power to reduce the nominal share capital of the company from 50l. to 12!. lOs. per share. The utmost amount then that could be called up would be Sl. 16s. per share. The directors assume the cost of the junction with the Warrenpoint Railway at 8,000., being 1,OOOL. above tho highest estimate. The capital account to the 30th of Juno shows that 131,32GI. had been expended, leavin a balance against the company of 1,461l. The statement of assets and liabilities shows a deficiency of TRAFC RETURNS. Miles Pas- ier- Total, Total, lwaf s. open. senge. chandise. 153. isS.
