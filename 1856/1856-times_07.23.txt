EGYPT. (FBOM 0UR ow COFzBsroNmT.) A ALEXAN-DRIA JULY 12. Six boxes of letters, forming part of the India mail closed in London on the 26th of June, have been left behind in Egypt, and will be forwarded only with the next maiL They consisted of one box for Calcutta, two for Madras, one for Bombay, one for the Mauitius, and one for Reunion. The cause of this untoward event was that one of tile camels laden with these boxes, kbeing a wild, unmanageable animal, strayed away from the other camels and was not found until 24 hours after. The steamer Cadiz, which might have left Suez for Bombay with the mails on the 7th, was detained until the evening of the 8th, but as no tracess of the missing camel had then been discovered she had to start without them. Recent intelligence received from Arabia states that the last Scheriff appointed by 'the Sultan to Mecca, MohamedBen Aavoon, had finally succeeded in asserting his rights in that country. and that his predecessor, Aboo Moottalib, who had endeavoured to make a stand against the Sultan's authority, had surrendered to the Turkish troops, and was to have been sent to Egypt vid Cosseir. Aboo Moottalib, when reduced to his last entremity, had takenrefuge-in-thetown of Taif, which the Sultan's soldiers surrounded, when the inhabitants of the town offered to give the Scheriff up under guarantees of security to themselves, which was given. it is hoped that this part of Arabia will now be enabled to enjoy some of the blessings of peace, as it has been for a considerable time in a state of great anarchy and civil warfare. Prices of produce in Egypt are being run up very high. Freights are also better. Exchange, 10i piastres per pound sterling. The harvests throughouOt Syria axe this year very abundant, and the silk crop has also been very good. _
PORTUG-AL. p IIVERPOOIL JULY 22. The Battler steamer, arrived here with Lisbon dates of the 14th inst., brings no political news of importance. Every exertion was being made by the Government to close the Cortes on the 15th. The deputies had voted unaninmously the bill to authorize the 330,000/. loan for public works. The tPeninsular packet '1agus landed her mails at Lisbon on the 12th, late in the evening, and went on next morning for Cadiz and GibraltaLr. The Royal Mail packet Tamar, with the mails for South America, called at Lisbon on the 13th, and left at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The Prench steamship Prince Jerome, from Toulon, was coaling at Lisbon when the Rattler left. Her Majesty's steamers Leopard and Odin also put into the Tagus for coals on the 14th, the former having left at anchor outside the bar the Danish transport ship Espindola, which she istowing home from the Crinea with the Land Transport Corps on board. The Odin had, before entering the Tagus, parted company with Her Majesty's ship London, which she was to rejoin after coaling, but the London had notbeen signalled offthe bar whenxour Lisbon correspondent closed his letter. Two British ships of the line and a steam-frigate with troops from the East, which had been some days detained at Cascaes-bay by contrary winds, were supposed to have proceeded on their voyage during the night, as the frigate was alone in sight at daybreak on the 14th, steering north.
THE GERMRAS AT LDBRSHO-TT. TO THE EDITOB OF THE TILIS' Sir,-I beg you will do me the justice to insert in your paper a statement which I have to make in reference to an asticle concerning the Ist Jagers in your number of the 21st of July. Itis a misrepresentation to say that the regiment was guilty of disturbances duing the passage on board the Transit, oEnheir vay to Scatari. The regiment, under my command, was embarked, not on board the Transit, but on board tho Imperatriz, Captain Cox, and not the slightest complaint was made of the men, although I was a sick man at the time, with a broken arm, and my First Major had recently died on board of cholera. No disturbance whatever hasbeen created by the 1st Jagers on their homeward passage from the East, and I trust Captain Weeks, commander of the Colombo, will do me the favour to bring the good conduct of the men to the knowledge of the public. So much in replyto the remarks about the conduct of the IstJiigers on board. As for the afay at Aldershott, I will leave the defence of the regiment to others, who may judge with less partiality than, Sir your v bndirnt srvÂ¢n. i-. SCHROMR, Lieutenant-Coloncl.

FATAL CoLI-EMY EXPLOSION.-An explosion of fire-damp occarred in the S rafford Main Coflie ,Stainborough, near Barnsley, belonging to Messrs. Smit , Carr, and Smith, on Saturday afternoon, just as the men were leaving work, owing to the negligence of the two persons who were fortunately the onuy victims of the accident. Most of the hands had got out of the pit, when a man named George Ward, aged 38, and alad named William Griffiths, aged 17, a sor of one of the managers of the pit, incautiouslytookalighted candle into a 'benk"to searchfor some metal rails. The flame inmediately came into conUtactwith some foul air. which is supposed to have been liberated by the falling in of a portion of the roof a day or two previously, anda loud explosior ensued. Ward -was killed on the spot, and his body presented a shocking mutilated appearance. Griffiths escaped death, but was very Eeriously injured, being much contused about hishead and other parts of his body; one leg was also broken. The effects of the exvlosiou wexe confined to the vicinity of the "benlk'in 'which it originated, or the los of life wrould havo been considerable. It is due to the pronrietors of the pit to state that they have introduced every modern improvement- for the prevention of accidVents, and that this is theJfirst casualty of the kind that hiw happened under their management.

I DRESSMAKERS AND THEIB CUSTOMERS. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-By your powerful aid public attention has been drawn to the pitiable condition of the poor needlewvomen of the metropolis, and to their claim on the consideration of society for relaxationfronn their incessant toil and ill-zequited labour. May I request your advocaey in behalf of a little less injured class-the immediate employers of the needlewomen ? Within the last few days a case has come to my knowledge where a deserving dresrsaker, much einployed by wealthy people, has been obliged, by inability to pay her debts, to submit 'o have an execution enforced in her house, to decline to receive articles to make up, to xefuse orders, and, in sborb, to abandon her business and the means of livelihood of herself and her assistants, beeause a number of her rich customers have not paid, and wJIl not submit to be pressed to pay, their bills, some of which were delivered one, two, and even thr,e years ago. To add to the distress of this case, aged parents, a sick sister, and a brother out of emliloy are alike sufferers from what I may justly call the dishonesty of the wealthy debbors, who are nightly exhibiting at the gay parties of the season the dresses for which they have not paid. These people may be shocked at being caled dishonest for only postponing (in this instance till their victim is reined) the discharge of their biUs " to a more convenient season ;" but thoughtlessness is no excuse for such conduct, and a passing regret at tha result will bo but a miserable compensation for the desolated home and blighted hopes of the poor dressmaker.

This we deny, the principal cause of our leaving being the fact of Mr. Minto having csased an explosion on the 2d of June in consequence of his buildin' up a ' stopping,' so that we believed our lives would be in danger were he to continue our snaner. It is perfectly true, as stated in the papers, that Mr. Morton (the Govermment inspector) reported as to the perfectly safe and efficient state of the pit, but it should be borne in mind that that gentlemam did not inspect it until eight days after he bad been written to by us, so that the proprietors had sufficient time to clear the workings, which would most likely alopear in a very different state to what they were at the time the complaint was made. The article alluded to also states that there hal been a conspiracy among the miners in this instance. This we boldly3assert, to be false and malicious, as our sole reason for leaving ouar work was the desire to preserve our livet, and not heedlessly to hazard them by worling under P rman wlhose want of experience and love of e:tperiments might some day lead to a, catastrophe similar to that which ocwurredin 14S7. In conclusion, we rnow state our willingness to return to work provided Mr. Minto has not the future management of the pit, otherwise we must remain out, as wve do not intend to ron the hazard of sacrifiing our lives for the benefit of any on or persons. By order of the Committee of the Oaks Miners." The men, who had already retuned to work, have again left, in consequence of a ruole established by the coal proprietors of the district not to employ any r;mer unless he has a written cleazance from his last employer. lfany of the men on strike would find work at the neighbourIng collieries, but for this rule, the reftasal of the proprietors of the Oaks colliery to give the necessary " clearance"preeluding them from snakcin engagements elsewhere. Some collisions have taken- place between the turnouts, and some of their comorades wise have returned to work have been xssaultedin a violent manner with stones and other m1siles; the police have also been attackredia one of these iff ays. * oY.A COvro OF Sulsrtlos..-The following getlemen havintg undZergone the; necessar examination for> tnedsploinawereadmittedrimembersl of the College at the xteetissgof the Coutrt of Examiners on 'the 21st lut.- Mfessrs.

Whit chacter he asumied durin the deiberatios -vith elseed doors I could not say, but I corld not shut my eyes to the fact that that learned gentlemarn was a colleague of the noble lord, art was therefore-no doubt most unfairly-open to the suspicon that he might not have been more impatient for the drawing up of the report than the noble lord was for producing it. In passing, I must tske -the opportaunity of observing that it, wasrepugnant to al sense of justiCo that in a pelitiusi inquiry *rlitical partisan should be the officer to advise the rourt. review of 'the prdceedings at Chelsea nade it clear that the adminis- tration of justice before milita-y courts required consiera - tion on the part of theIegislature, and, as I believed that that consideration could not bh given to it in. aore fitting pl3ae than their lordships' house, I hoped thit the next session would not pass avway without the' attention of that House being called to the office of the J'adge-AdvocateGeneral, the functions of that officer, his tenure of office, and the mode of procedure before military courts, which I did not hesitate to say was at present: Unecessarily tedious and obstructive to eliciting truth.," I believe that to be an accurate report of wbat fell from mue on the oc3asion. But the learned gentleman in another place has thought fit to put words into my mouth. As I do not wish to detain the House long I wil only advert to those observations of the learned gentleman to which I taLe exception. The learned gentlsman is reported to have said, but I hopo he has been misreported:- " I am told thlat a noble lord, in complaining that the report had not been laid upon the table sooner, ascribed the delsy to the fact that I had drawn the report, and that I 'had been dilatory in the matter for the purpose of serving the objects of the Minister of War." Now, I never for one moment supposed that the learned gentleman had drawn up the report, nor dr- I state so in my speech. I said that there was no great impatience shown on the part of the Minister of War to present the report, |and the learned gentleman, being a colleague of his, might b eraps unfairly be open to the suspicion that he was not himself vrery impatient for the drawsing ulp of the report. The learned gentleman proceeded, according to the report, G~~~~~~~~~~~~t tho say:- , o"Tenoble lord has beenin constant communication with persons who have been connected with this inquiry and report, and I do not believe that anybody of the least authoI rity has given him this information." I deny in the most positive and solemn manne- that I have been in communication with any one individual connected with the inquiry. The learned gentleman thengoes on to say "he has not obtained i' irom Lord Hardinge.e What does that signify? It means that I did obtain it fromLord Eardinge. Though there is a connex1on between me and Lord lIardinge through ourchildren, yetInever sawsoittle of Lord ardinge6asduringthelastsixmonths, anditis apositive fact that I have never seen him to exchange words with him since the 18th of April lest. Nevertheless, Imay be told that it is most likely a communication has taken place through my daughter or son-in-lav. I declare m the most solemr manner that until the last week I never myself touched on the subiect to my daughter or to tfr. Hardinge, whom I had not seen of late three times till the last fortnight; "With whom," continued the learned gentleian, " he hobaeeninjfre*ienb commnincation of late about these proceedigs. ES&ever was anything so fabulously untrue. The noble lord opposite has the advantage of me, inasmuch as he- was under the gallery in the House of Commons when this speech was made, and therefore he knows whether justico has been done to it in the report. Lord PAN MURE.-I was not under the gallery at the time. ("Hear," and a laugh.) The Earl of LtTCAN.-A gentleman-Colonel French, the member for Roscommon-came to me from the House of Commons and reported what was said there, and added that Lord Panmure was present. Lord PA? IURE.-I was at the House of Commons communicating with Lord Palmerston, but I was not under the gallery. The Earl of LUCA.-The learned gentleman is also reported to have said:- " It is further reported that this noble lord imputed to me partiality during the conduct of the inquiry, and that I had abused the authority with which I was invested in order to prejudice hinL . . . . . . The noble lord complains that the inquiry was political in its character, owing to the circumstance of the Judge-Advocate being a Minister and attending the Court." Now, I deny that anything that fell from me was to that effe*t. I never caled it a political inquiry for that reason. I do not consider that the composition of a board makes an L.quiry political; it is the matter that comes before it that does so. I admit that this is partly a military and partly a political inquiry. I havo not read much of the report, but if the officers in exonerating themselves have throwvn the blame on Sir C. 5Trevelyan, the inquiry was a political one. I think I have cause to complain of the sentence I am now goig to read.. The learned gentleman is represented to have said:- ' And I ain bound to say I believe that, however incomplete the inouiry and insufficient the evidence might have been in Lora Lucan's case, yet the general officers, looking to what evidence they had tD decide upon, have given a just verdicb. Now the case, I think, lasted, with the intermission of a day or so, three weeks, and I never heard till this hour that there was any one point in ny case requiring further elucidation. If ever there was a case thoroughly investigated it was mine, and this learned gentleman, when he cannot deny that the verdict of these distinguished officers was favourable and just, adds, nevertheless, that the evidence was incomplete. Now, it is not too much to say that thin insiluation is baseless, and, if the learned gentleman did utter it, it is base. I have now adverted to all the points I think necessary to notice, and I shall not offer much comment on them. I shall centent myself with leaving the House and the pablic to form their opinion as to whom the charge falls on of uttering unmitigateduntruths. I -will only give this advice to the learned gentleman, that, seeing he holds a judicial situation and is supqosed, therefore, to have the benefit of judicial immunity, ne should be a little more cautious in the language he uses. Lord P1ANURE.-I think I cannot do better than give the noble earl the advice he has given to the rtht hon. and learned gentleman in another place-to be a little more careful in the language he uses towards other parties, and to avoid provoking a reply. I understood the noble earl to have distinctly stated that the Judge-Advocate- General had drawn up the repor' of the commissioners, and that he had used his position for delaying the production of the report. That was not only my understanding, but also the understanding of a member of the Board of Inquiry, who, if my r-collection serves me right, got up in his place in this house and defended the Judge-Advocate from the charge. I can only state that I think it is extremely to be regretted that the noble earl should take advantage of his position as a peer of Parliament to pass grave reflections on the highest judiclauthorityof thearmy-theindividualwhoadmuinisters itscriminallaw. Thatisbringingintocontemptnotonlythe high authority of the Crows, but the high authority of a civil member of the service to which the noble earl belongs. I enter not into the controversy between the two parties carried on in two separate Houses of Parliament; but, if an officer of tne Crown is attacked and charges are brought against him in one Hlonse of Parliameni, the noble ,arl must not be surprised if the person attacked, vindicates himself in the only place where he has the opportunity of makling his defence. The Earl of LUCAN.-I challenge the noble lord to produce any newspaper in which it is reported that I said that the learned gentleman had drawn up the Teport. I said notlitngofthe sort. WhatI did say was, that " theleamed gentleman was a colleague of the noblelord, and was therefore, no doubt most unfairly, open to the suspiclon that, he might not have been more impatient for the drawing up of the report than the noble lord was producing it."

While the ordnance imd earm depatents were perfectly separate there coula not, uithout violdation of law, be an application of ordnance money to army purposes, or ,of arms money oe ordnance purposes. But when the two de-S pJameses were am nited, votes granted fo.r army parposes might have been transferred, with the Consent of the Ptreasre, to ordnance purposes. Thatl wuid have been. a gre at abuse, and, by a most judiciots a pgementg cohmopletel separating the votesp it was now entinely prevented. Atserit there were some dibuculties arisingcfrm the consoh-. datiocn of the two deparments and, foresee.ng those difeculties, the late Chancellor ofrtheEvxchequer andthe present Chancellor ef twhe dchequer asked and obtained from Partiamndt large votes on account. He took no,on himself to say (and he did not think the noble lord&at the head of.the War Departmenb frould contradict bim) 'that-nbnt for those lnrge uAna propratwed sums ite mold have 'been utterly impossilre to cai on thne late w;ar eoficiently. (Hear.) lt was wdith considerable repugnance that he iewed the removal of the ordnance a ndounts from the indeendeut Board of Auditors tohis noble friend (Leord IPanumure). The alteration wvas very similar to the alter .tion -with respect to tshe comiss t. Any aeudit, to be effectu^al, must boe independent, aud disconnected from the department ^whose accounts were to he controlled. In any other form it w^ouli he a perfcot fallacy, and could ^not. banswer any useful purpose. It might be sad there was the Parlido entary audit, established upon the sgestionh -of Sir James aham, butthat-aonlyfor theHpurpose oE ascerataing that tbe-eoueyawe applied to the purposenXor Iwrhidlithey were voted. The g*eneral a-undit nstrsfeiredi to his noble friend, and he could not help expressing ht opamon that any departure from -ba independent *audit was destructive of -what ought to he the best security for the distribution of the public money, and the execution of the public works. (Rear, hea;r.). The Audit-office had bcen relieved of the army accounts, which had been placed under the iptios e very doe perthdent which incured the exwenditue, thus establisihing the somewbat ridiculousprinciplemof brrowingdepartment to audit their own accounts That s a point to which pe trunsted his noble friend torld htun is attend t on, for the present wras a moment when it would be most dangerous to nepart from the old rule of an independent audit of accounts. He also wished to obssrve upon the suzbject of our future erpenditture. We had just closed a wpar, psd were in a transition state from a axvish expenditureto a smore conomical system. At witse economy, duly exercised, --would be a protection against the false economy which would break dowvn all the national establishments, and render them useless far the services for which they were intended. Hbe wias glad to find that the subject bad been ta,ken up in the other house, not isn a rash and hasty sprt of economy, but ha dise and prudent men, -whom brought their long official experience to bear upon it. At resent our fiances were in w somewhat peculir condition. aring the war considerable sums hed been voted and very oppressive taxation levied, upon a specific ptlege that after a certaLin time those taxes should cease. The property-tax, the malt, tea, sugar, and coffee daties had been increasedo upon teha. understanding, and he-would be a bold nsinister who shlould propose to depart from it. While, haowever, oulrtincome was dimtiihing from those sources our exuendithre vould increase. By a new system of borrowing mciney upon long-dated bills the country was bound to pay 2,tCa,tt y. per anmnm for three year:, snd 1,500,001. for ay fourth year, to meet a loan that bad been contracted, and a bi ano upon their lordshi table proposed to grant an ulternitetie power of extendmg that susten. There pasalses of prospective sinking fund for the final exstinction of the late war nebt, which eas considerable. he thought the Chancellor of theBxcheuer had shown a wise judgment in not relying wholly upon taxation to meet the expenditure of the war, but bad had recourse to a mixed symstemn of taxation and borrowing. There weab anotherapoint which was wort.hy of consideration. He reierred to the manner in which the savings-hank fund had been dealt vdth by the Governmnent. Hle did not mean to say that what had been. done was contrary to the law, and stiU less did he intend toconntenance anybie doubts wich some personsmightentertain of the scuritypor solvenuy of those ,% eful ti sttustions the savings-banks; but, ats the same tie, he was of opinion that the system which had been acted upon was wel worthy of warlicepentaryinquiry and examination, which he trusted it would receive at no distant period. He conceived there vas a serious acnger to the publc service in the exercise by tbe Treasury of the powver which it undobtedly possessed cftselig out stock belonging todsavings-banks, ineorder to facilitate its own financial operations. The contro' over savings-banks, which was vested in the Governmnent, did not originally extend to the sldeof s ukbbelonging to those instituitions, but thDat power wa^s conferred by an act whaich ws subsequlently, and as he beLieved unwisely, passed. At presenti ohen a Chancellor of the txchequer found the market for Exchequer-bonds and hils falling he sold-out stovins' bink stocdh and invested the proceeds in the pur- chase of his depreciated seudalte, thus maling his savings-banks operations auiliry to his financial plans. These operations had been carried on of late to an extent -which, ne supposed, was btithoutgeample. There had been a continued action on the pert cf the Chancellor of: the Exchequer upon the stock-market, usd such anaction could robttako pioe without produ.cing aa actual effect orethe price of stock. Niow, the Iodors of public securities had no protection against the Chancellor o f the Exchequer, who appeared on the market' as the -proprietor of 30 millions of stsock, nand he therefore hoped that, as the exigencies of the war could no longer be urged as en ecuse, the noractiee tO which hehad alluded'-wnould altogether cease. He trusted their lord;hips wvould pardon him for having de'taine.d themn by remarL-s upon a subject which they, no doubt,cnied suffciently uninviting but he thought it be ov1d temto consider allthese mantters, because theyhad the resnonsihiihty, if not of voting taxes, at least of pasingr hills mvhich L,ordPlANXMURE sad that into the general subject so ably alluded to b_ his noble friend he should not attempt to enter, huit -there -wer one or two points to which referencee had been made upon which he wished to make a few observations.

HOIJSE OrF COcuOIS, TursDY, JuLy 22. The SP33AKER tookl the chair at 12 o'clock. The following bills were read a third time:-Bell's Estate Bill, Dallington Estate Bill, and Thoroton's and Croft's Estate Bill. COUNTY COURTS ACTS AAENDMENT BELL. On the order of the day for the third reading of this bill being read, Mr. GLADSTONE said, that when the House went into committee he took objection to what he thought a hasty proceeding, one which had not been duly considered and examined, and by which a charge of 170,0001. a-year would be imposed upon the public purse. He stated that such a charge ought not to be created without the House having previously examined into the state of the existing judicial establilhnients, 'n order to ascertain whether the country was subject to an unnecessary burden on that account. The answer givea to him on that occasion was, that the subject of the County Courts ought to be con' sidered by itself, and that, although there might be ground or inquiry as to the judicial position of Westminster-halD, yet that constituted no reason why the boon which justice demanded ir the extension of the benefit of the County Courts to the country should be withheld As the House appeared favourable to the measure le did not divide upon it, although he retained a strong opinion as to the precipitancy of the measure. But 'what he ebiefly wished to advert to now w-asthe judicial establishment at Westminster-hall. It was a subject which never could be satisfactorily examined into, except by the direct action of the Government. ARl that a private member of the House could do was to snake an appeal to the Government to undertake the examination of ihat important question. That was the object which he had in view on the present occasion. He should not be justified on this occasion in pressint for any positive or definite answer on such a subject, but the question he wished to ask Her Majesty's Governmen' was tniswhether, during the recess, Her Majesty's Government were disposed to make an inquiry into the state of the judicial establishment in Westminster-ball, andwhether the present number of judges sitting in Westminster-hallrwas essential, taking into review the immense relief which the courts inWestminster-hall had ex33erienced by the extension o- the jurisdiction of the County Cour, and that at a heavy charge on the country9 An] opportunity would be afiorded during the recess for Gxovernment to make up their mninds 'whether the establishmuent in WVestminster-hall wras more than adequate to the purposes required of it. Of course any reduction would be irrespective of the vested interests of the present holders of the official appointments connected with the Judicial office. He should bh very glad if his sight hon. friend th-3 Secretary of State for the Home Department could give him any assurance on the subject. Sir G. GREY said, he could not give any opinion as to whether it was practicable that a reduction might or might not be made in the number of judges in Westminster-hall. He believed, however, thas his right hon. friend was mistaken in supposing that there had been any diminution in the business of the courts at Westminster-hall since the formation of the County Courts. It was true that a certain description of business had diminished on some of the circuits. If, indeed, the County Courts had jurisdiction over criminal matters the business of the assizes might be materially diminished, but that was not the case; although, therefore, the civil business might be less, still the duty at the as4zes remained much the same. Besides, the increased demand of judges on the circuits would make it impossible to reduce the number of those functionaries. The county of Glamorgan loudly complained at having only one judge at the assizes ; but it had been repTesented to him that no more than one judge could be spared for that circuit without extendinrg the employment of judges and counsel far into the vacation. It was true there might be a new distribution of the circuits (hear, hear), by which a greater quantity of business might be got through with a less number of judges; but that was a subject which demanded mature consideration. The bill was then read a third time. On the motion of Colonel W. PATTmv, a clause was inserted extending the provisions of the bill relating to the superior courts to the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and Court of Pleas at Durham. Mr. HA.DFIELD moved a clause to empower articled derks to attorneys, of two years' standing, to appear as advocates in the County Courts. The hon. member supported the clause chicfly on the ground that these County Courts ought to be regarded as legal, schools in which the young students of the lower branch of the law (namely. attorneysS clerks) should be enabled to acquire a practical knowledge of their profession. Tne &TTORNEY-GENERAL objected to the clause, and said, these courts were not intended as schools in which a professional education was to be acquired. There were no other courts in which students wvere allowed to exercise the functions of an advocate. Besides, attorness were officers of these courts as well as of the superior courts, and those courts possessed a species of control over them; bhut derks would not be under the control of those courts. Mr. HEYWOOD supported the clause. Mr. STAFFORD thought that the object really was to enable young men to acquire tbe art of public speakdng at other people's expense. (" Hear !" and laughter.) Mr. GLADSTONE regarded this as a very important question. Either a person must appear before the judge and state his own case, or he must employ a barrister or an attorney. For the reason stated by the Attorney-General, he tbought it highly desirable that a person who representea paty in a suit should be under che control of the Court. If ttlis rule were relaxed it should not be in favour of attorneys' clerks, but rather in favour of the private agents of the parties concerned. On the whole, however, he thought it better that none but professional men should be emp oyed. Mr. CRAVUFURD said, he should be glad if that were the law, but unfortunately it was the case that not only might a party a.ppe.ar in the County Court by himself, but he had a right to appear by "counsel, attorney, or agent." Under the term 'agent" a set of persons calling themselves $'County Court advocates"' had crept in, who were wholly unacquaDsited 'with the law, and whose conduct was hiohly detrimental to the efshciency of those courts. Mr. maUdeIN GS thought thoee was some misunderstanding about the measing of the word "Pagent." eu anderstood it oad been construed as meaning the agents or stewards of the parties, and not strangers tendering their services. Msr. GLziDSTONE scaid, it was desirable the law should be clearly understoed on this point. Many persona wished thattheir own agents shouldbe allohed to appear in cases of small demands. It mnight howfever ho difficult in some cases to distiugaish between a permanent agent and an agent pro lMc vice. He admitted that to sanction the latter description of agent might open the door to gross abuses. But, in the case of smuUalcisius, a refusal to hear an agent might be an actual denial of justice. Sir T. B. PERRY believed the law to be that a party could only appear by a Professional agent, or by an attorncy, or- by a gratuitous agent. Ho hoped no rule would be Laid don-n which should prevent the employment of a gratuitous ageat. It was quite clear that the judges of the County Courts had ample power to prevent any abuse in this reag.nt The A TTORNEY-GENERAL said, that the judges of the County Courts would not allow any person to appear as a +,aid advocate for any party unless he were an attorney or a arrister. Mr. F1rOY understood the practice to be to admait an agent to appear in the.character of a witness rather than as ,n advocate. He was allowed to state Isis party's case, bu:t he was not pe-rmtted to plead or argue upon it. Kr. TADFILD said lie wouald not divide the House, 'The clause was therefore withdrawn.

Sir B.

House in reve.rsing a decision come to many years ago. The clause ws put and negatived. , . Mr. ROEBUCK said, he had discovered that in clause .10 an armendment had been introduced of whiehich i notice was previously given. It related to the comp6nsation to'be mnace to thec1elrks -whose business was going to betaken away. That compensation: had- been raised from onefourth to one-third without anynotice whatever. The House had gone through Eome of the forms, but not the whole. He believed that no alteration could be made in a bill on a third reading without notice. The SPEAKER said, the hon. and learned gentleman was mistaken. The rnle of the House was, that no clause should be inserted on the third reading without notice; but -an amendment might be made without notice. Sir-J. GRAIA A L-Then, has the amendment passed X The SPEAKER.-Yes. Sir J. GRAHAML-Is it not open for the House to discuss it? - The SPEAER.-No. Sir J. GRA.HAM.-Then I cannot sufficiently express my surprise and sorrow. (Hear, hear.) Af ter some other amendments being made in the bill, The SPEAKER stated that it was now competent for the Secretary of the Treasury to explain under what circitmstances the amendment had been introduced into the-bill for giving one-third intead of one-fourth of the existing salaies as a compensation to the retiring clerks. Mr. VILSON said, tnat by this biUl Parliament was re pealing an act by which the clerks were entitled to a la-rg, salary. He submitted that, whether the bill proposed to retain one-third or one-fourth of the existing salary, it would not be an increase of charge on the public. It was a charge to be paid out of fees already imposed. The reason of the alteration from one-fourth to one-third was, that orginally a discretionary power was given to the Government as to the amount to he Paid to these clerk s; but when it was thought more advisable to fix an absolute sum, without any discretion being left to the Government, then it was thought that. one-third would be a fair arrangement. These men had been induced to abandon their private practice in order to devote their services to the public. Suposing a clerk to be now receiving 0G01. a-year--by this bilI he would only receive 2001. a-year; and the mere possibility of returning to his private practice was a thing more easily spoken of than accomplished. Sir J. GRAHAM was perfectly sure, from his knowledge of his hon. friend, that the insertion of the amendment changing the rate of compensation froin one-fourth to one. third, withontnot.ce,wasbyinadvertence. By theoriginalbill, however, it never was contemplated that a plurality of ofices sh ould be established. He (Sir J. Graham) took sbam eto himself in not having foreseen the possibility of that plurality of ' offices. It was contrary to the spirit, if not the letter of the act. It was now tbought desirable to buy out this abuse by compensation, and he thought a compensation of onefourth, sanctioned as it had been by the committee, was most ample. He had that morning received an anonymous letter from Dewsbury, stating that, if any argument were wantingto showtheseriousinconvenience arisingfromnon-resident chief clerks, it was to be found in the fact that the clerk for the towns of Dewsbury, Pontefract, and another large neighhouring town, was residing in Leeds and that the duties wese delegated to a young man, the csief clerk attending only on court days. Eor these duties he received fees amounting to 2,2001., out of which be paid about 5001. for salaries to clerkxs, retaining a net income of 1,7001. a-year, a. suns exceeding the salary of any County Court jadge in the kingdom. He should wait with some anxiety to hear the decision of the Speaker as to whether the advance of the amount of compensation from one-fourth to one-third was obligatory on the House or not. The SPEAKER.-My decision will have no reference whatever to the merits of the case. It will be stricty of a technical character. In ordinary cases it is not competent for any person to propose a greater charge on the revenue of the country than the amount which has passed the committee. The only exception to that rule is, where a bill is I introduced to amend an act which was passed in a pre. vious session, and which act imposed a higher chargethan is intended to be proposed by the bill thus newly introduced. When the amendment, therefore, was propose I by the hon. gentleman (Mdr.Wilson) it was impossible for me to know whether the increased amount of compensation came within the ordinary rules of the House, or whether there was such a chayge created by the previous bill as would cover the amount proposed by the hon. member. But, as I- now understand, there was no change whatever under the old law. If I am right in that, then you ought not to attempt to exceed the limits fixed by the committee. Therefore, I consider that the amendment which has been introduced into the clause is informal, and one which ought not to be made; and it is therefore cancelled. Mr. HENLEY said, it was quite clear that it was not intended there should be miore than one clerk to e.ch court. But no check having been enacted, these men had got a monopoly of clerkships in every district. Mr. WILSON said that, with reference to the anonymous letter rsead by the right hon. baronet (Sir J. Graham), thera was no doubt it was entirely untree. It was impossible that any man could have received such a salary. It would have been entirely ilegal. Mr. CAYLEY thought the clerks who would be displaced by this bil had been hardly used. The bill was then passed. VICE-PRESIDENT OF COMITTEE OF COUNCIL ON EDUCATION BILL. On the motion that this bill be read a third time, Mr. HENLEY said, that no reason had been adduced by the Secretary of State to satisfy bim that it was necessary to bring another paid officer into that houe. Itiwould require strong reasons to make that course necessary. He therefore wished, at all eveuts, to record his own opinion thagnst pnes- og this bill, and thereby saddgeng an additional charge upon the public. NSotion of an amendment had been given tat this new officer shonld overlookIrish education as well as English. Tha.t opened up a large question. He under. stood, also, that this new officer was to undertake the charge of the various scienti6ic societies that were now in vogue. But the House having negatived by a large majority the scheme for a general system of education pro. posed by the noble lord the member for the city of London, be could not but think that the object of having an officer of this description had reference to a desire to set up some large scheme of national education, to he conducted bythe Government. That being the case, he could well understand why the Oovernment should press this measure. But being of opinion that there was no necessity for it, heshould move that it should he read a second time that day three month^-. Mr. GLADST1ONE concurred in the general views. of the right hon. gentleman* with re.pect to this biD. He saw with some regret a relaxation of that jealousy which this Iouse formerly evinced with reference to the multiplication of paid offcers in that house. The House was not now so rigid in re9uiring a case to be made out for such a measure as he could wish it was. Nay, individual members of the House sometimes rather officiously pressed upon the Government the multiplication of paid members; and, moreover, a practice appeared to be growing up of creating offices before they bad created duties which the persons fillingthose offices were to perform, in- stead of firA ascertaDnnDgwhat duties Nve-r-e to Se done' ard then providing officers for the discharge of those duties. The nght hon. gentleman (Mr. Henley) had said with great justico that there was a connexion between this bill when it was first introduced, and of certain schemes which were entertained, and which at one time wero thought probable might boadopted in regardtonational education. There was strong evidence in favour of that view. This bill was introduced in the House of Lords at an early period ot the session, and notice w as at the same time gsven by Lord John lussell of his resolutions on the subjet of education. The further proceedings with this bill were delayed by the Government in order to ascertain hat w ere the view s of Parliamuent wit o reference to those resolutions. The views -of Parliament were declared in a most emphatic manner, and those resolutions were now naubered with the things that- were. But this bill, notwithstanding, was sti proceeded with. He could wish that the proceedings taken upon the matter of education were such-as might not involve a chance at a future period of their retrograding from what they hat had already done. He was -bound to admit that generall their proceedings had beea of that kind; and that they -ha t not taken a backward- ourse, but that the sileasures which had been adopted had been taken after ' fell- discu.ssion, and that they had raceived :in gene- ral the matureappro bation of the country, But ith respect t o this bill he could not regard it as at all ettling tOes ?estionbich'it raised.'

Sir G.

The G,overnment were presed to establish anL individaalizaa responsibility, and to place the administration of thosze funds under t-heSuprintendence of one M-inister. It was also iirgedi that the educational department ought to ,be r',seftedinthat house, who, ina conjunction with the P?pesidentofthe Council, should tak~eupon himself thelad ui. nistrationofthaosefundsgrantedby Parliamentiorcducatiojsmal purposes, It was also suggested that the seine board should take upon themselves the5 charge now intrust-ed to the Board of Trade connected withlartand. science. The First Lord of the Treasury said in reply to these Appeals, that the GOvernment wvould not shrink from proposing to Parliament such a Measure. These were the reasons to begiven forestbliashing this new officer of the Government wvhich wasmraly designed to mooetwhat wvas understood to be the genersd 'wvish of the Hfouse. Tho bill didl not involve the question of salary ' that wYould corns annually before Parliamient. The right Lon. gentleman had drawn a distin,ction between a Privy Councillor and not a, Privy Councilor. but that was qutebeside the question raised by the ri-ht hon. mem. bar for Oxfors-dhire. That right hion. gentleman objected to any alteration of the present sytesn, oar to aniy paid officer sittinig in that house -who should be aLble to give, that information which it wcould be his duty to give, If It sny future period:it should'be thiought better that public education shouldbe:mepresent-edbyane-xecutive officer insteadl of by a Vice-P.resident, and that hissalary shonldhael,501. a-year ini.t-edof2,00)Lit'wouAldbeqmiiteopenfortheHousetoadopt, thatourse.

But it was, neverthieless, the gnrlfeling of the House that means should be tae oextend eduication throughouit the kingdom; and it'was thoughit that the existing means nesd now 'were the~ best that could be devised. When the Committee of P-rivy COuncil was first established, the grants of ptiblic money were small, and the duties 'were of a light charact.r, so that the cormaittee possessed suincient machinery to administer those funds. But slow that the grants had larely increased, and- the bushiess connected with the, departmient 'of cducation hae likewise increased, it was felt desrirale that the educ-ational department should be enlarged, ~nd that it should be representcd by an influ_ential Miinkstcr in the House cif Commons. Mr. NAPIER. was of opinion that it would be of gr4at advantage to hiave a responsible Minister of Education. in the house, if that minister were moade to represent the whole of the united kingdom. But he understood that the bill was not istended to be aPPlied tolireland. If the bill were to be passed, in that shaipe it 'woutld be drawingastl wider line odemarcation bettween England and Island on, the subject of Baucation thant at present existed. Mr. H1. VERNION could not allOw one observation of the Secretary for time Home Department to pass 'without remarkc. The right hon. gentIensan said it was quite bSid the question to makeo any objections to the bill on the ground of the position which the pnsposed officer was to occupy, or to object to his being a Privy Councillor. Yiow, the bil consisted of one clause, and he conceived tha t he whole force andi pith Of the bill 'was thLat the propoted Minister should be a highly salaried officer andt one of grat positiOn, It aPPeared to him that by this bill the resident of the Committee of the Privy Council 'would practically be made a. nullity. He confessed that heloedQwt great jealousy at the appobitment of such ano officer as this. He could nLot Possibly understand wvhat those mna tters csonnected with art. sod science, andl which 'were now easeo slated with theo Board of Trade, hadl to do wivth education in a practical sense. He 'was -aware that persons takdsout the education of the people being promoted by ariad science in en indirect manner. That, ino dout wa bre ut, what 'was required in this instalece . was a. hard-woridag officer,- -lye admittd that it woulcd hoa of grer.t advantage to have one Minister on fthe subjea-bi of education resposesble to thatHEouse.

BuI'the suggestionwhichahaLdbeau miade that daywoiuld fully meet-the case.

Vernon) Would adJnit that a strong case had been made out for having some officer; bat he should say an inferior officer of the Govermnent appoited to discharge that dty It could not, ho ever, be said, that it was of no importance whetlher that off cer was a Privy Councillor or not. It -was of great importance for this reason, that he must be strictly a Ministerial officer. His sole and entire business would be to carry out the views of Parliment, and the vEwms of the President of the Commuittee of Privy Council. It wouldnotdo tohavetwoeq-Alauthorities in the same department. HeR must be distinctl subordinate to the Pr-; sident of the PDvy Council, anid he must not go beyond the intentions of the Privy Council.

TEE AMNESTY. | Mr. T. DNCOMB;E rose to ask the right hon. baronet I the Home Secretary -whether, under the recent Act of Amnesty, granted by Her Majesty to all political exiles, orders had been given for the liberation of the following risoners convicted of high treason at the York Assizes of bepteimber, 1820. and-ttansported to Van Diemen's Land by the ship Lady Ridley in 1S21 :-WllLlism Comstive, W,1ham Rice, Richard Addy, Joseph Prith, Charles Stansfi-ld, John Birkenshaw, Benjamin Rogers, Joseph Chapel, Baniam^. Hanson, and Michael Downing ? These men were tried at York in the year 1820 on a charge of high treason, arising or,t of the proceedings of a seditious meeting held on the Grange Moor, and on the second day of the trial they, together with 1S others, pleaded " Guilty," on condition that their lives sbould be spared. These 10 persons were transported for life, while the others were sentenced to transuortation or imprisonment for various shorter periods. 'He had recently made inquiries at the Homeoffice, but had foumd that there was there no record of the conviction, and no trace of the whereabouts of these men. His object in asking this question was to make it known in the most distant regions of our colonial empire that these men had, in common with other political offenders, received Her Majetys pardon; and he hoped tlhat the geatlemen who sat in rhe gallery behind the Speaker's chair would aid him in his eudeavours to Obtain that object. (Cries of "Order, order."And a laugh.) Sir G. GREY said that it was not remarkable that no record of the conviction of these men was to be founad in t-he Home-ofce, because It occurred seone 36 years ago, and theseten persons were inA the following year transported either to V an Themen's Land or Ne.^ South Wales-he believed to the latter colony. From other sources ofinforma-tion he had ascertained that the offence of which they were convicted was s inilarin characterto those for which pardons had recently been granted. It was right that if any of these persons were living they should be included in the amnesty, and instructions had been sent to the colonies that they should be set at liberty. (Rear, hear.) BILLETING IN SCOTLANTD. Sir A. AGNEW asked the hon. gentleman the UnderSecretary for War whether Eler Majesty's Government weredisposed to relieve private families, as much as pos,ible, from the inconvenience of the present svstem of billeting in Scotland, by making other arrangements for the accommodation Of recruitinig parties and of the permanent stafis of militia? llr. PEEL said that the Government would consider whether it might not be possible to devise some means of accommodating the present staff of the militia without bileting them on the private inhabitants. PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS (SCOTLAND) B1LT,I The LORD-ADVOCATE brought up the following reasons for disagreeing from the Lords' amendments to the above-named bill, which were read and agreed to "Because the law at present in force in Scotland, by which no person can be admitted nas a schoolmaster ian any parochial school who does not sign the Confeesion or Faith, and is not an adherent of the established church, while it is unnece,ssary and ineffectual as a security for the religious character of the schoolmaster, is unsuited to the existingstate of the community in Scotland; operates as an excsion of persons it WaS intended to pr-o tect; unreasonably limnits the choice of those in whom theelection of schoolmasters IS vested; and reduces wshat vas intended to he a national syStem of education to the position of an inebitution purely denominationaL." TE1E CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. Mr. H. BERKELEY inquired whether any tenders for the con-aysnee of mail-s between England and the Cape cf Good Hope, and also for extending the same to the MAuuntls, Id,< ; an d homewards, bxd been received;-whe heicision being arrived. at, whetler the' Chancellor of the Exchequer would have any objection to lay on the table CoDieS of those tenders 9 Mr. WILSON replied that several tenders for the -conveyance of themails in onestion had been received and were under the considerition of the Government, who would probably decide upon thera in the course of tomorrow. When the onuestion was determined thore would he no objection to lay npon the table copies of the tenders. CHURCH ESTATE COMMISSIONERS. Mr. INGHAMI inquired of the right hon. member for the University of,Camblidge whether it was tlhe intention of the Ch-uch Estate Commissioners to act on the recommendations of the Committee on Ecclesiastical Comumisions as to the consideration to be shown to the 3essees of church lands for their beneficial interest in settling terms of enfrancise- Mr. WALPOLE replied that it was intended to act bonÂ§i .f,: upon three recommendations, and, indeed, the Church Estate Commissioners had clready begun to do so. ANNUAL F A1NCE ACCOUNbTS. Dr. Mm=CHEI inquired why.the annucl finance aeconts, which were upon thectable onthe 10th of.June, had not as yet been delivered, and whether they had been printed? fr.

Thiiuasia natterwhich came -within the *province of the (2rown. In the reign of Henry. vmL it rmw taken up b' eeveral very eminen'*men, and Lord Cromwell, Who was Sec-etarY of' State and the Ring's Vicegerent in sacred mater recomm6nded to the King 'to' give his sanctio- to a new trans4ation of the SCrptErs. Abedy of learned nenwas appointed forthe purpose They were asgisted by Archbishop Cranmer and other eminent persons, and the version of the Bible published under their - rection soon became 'o lar throughout the country. Then came the reign of Quee= Mary, during thich there 'Was a bitter persecutiOn of Pr stins, many of whom Ul to fiy for refuge to Geneva and. other place. At Geneva a fresh translation, or, to spesik more oor rectly, a revision of the fonner transdation, vas nd-er1aken and completed, and upon the revival of Protest. mtiesm, when-liabeth came to thethrone, that revised version was brought over to England. That edition hadi ioliowed Beza, as also had a1l subsequent editions, aid it. usis worthy of remark that when an erroneous traniationi 'was detected-it generally turnedl out that Beza was in fUlt. (Hear.) Beza was a decided Calvinist, and didnot scrnple to, turn a text so as to suit his own purposes. However, he was esteemeas great authority and hisinfiluence was paramoLnt. At the beginning of the reign of James L an application. sras made to the Crown to have the Bible again revised, and a commission was appointed for that purpose, in whieb the 'aritan eetnent was unrepresented. A reference to ihepreace of any family Bible would show that this body did not. attempt to make a new translation, but merely to revise' the old one-their object being to carry as much public feding as possible along with them in the execution of their' t. A sar spuit ought to actuate any conmmisioners selectelat the present day to revisethe existing tianldation. Unnecessary changes,which could only give offence to many persons, oughti to be strictly avoided; but there were various -passages at present -ucorrectly rendered that demaudedi alteration. There were nortions of the Scri tures which it ' painful to many clefgiymen of the church of England to' lavetoveadto their congregations in the nrecise w;ords of' the authorized version; nut, however faulty and repugnant to scholarship 'they might be, those clezgymen had no' alternative but- to. give them us they stood. This matter' 'as felt to he 'so pressig among the learned, that. ]rofessor Selwyn, of Cambridge, hd fgiven notice of a. mnotion for directing the attention of the clergy in convocation speciadly to it. Even so slight an alteration as that of the punctuation -would zender many passages cleaer. A recent articlein the E dinebusp, B1?cric2s aLso pointed outthe, a dvantages of a division of the chapters of the Bible into, paragraphs instead of verses. As an Mlustration of the errors of the present translation he might mention the text of the celebrated sermonon "Raelision in Common Thin's," Prelched befome the Queen by the'e Rev. Mr. (aird. FAe, text chosen on that occasion was, " Be not slothful in bosiness," and it was remarkable that the word "basiness" dil rnot appear in the original 4xeck. The correct word -was " zeal ," and the pasage rA, " Be nlOt backvward in zeaL" E;o tEhat there ws really nO conuexion betwveen the subject. c-f tihs excellent diMscourse and the tree interpr tation of the: telxtonwhichit wassensiblybased. Oher examples of careless translationnight easily be cited In the Acts of 'he Apostles, for instanoe, the phrase "Those matters which axe written in the la ndtheproihets"v wasput. into the mouth of St. Paul in lieu of the exict words,whicha were "1 Those matters which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets.' The correct readi showed -hat St. Paul, who was a believer in tradition, hela tradition in coniexion 'withthe law, but tooki the prophets literally. The passage in the first chapter of the first. epistle of St. John relating to the three heaveialy witnesses, en which an important doctrinal point turned, was not in. the original Greek, but had been interpolated by some interpreter. This text was, however, often used in argument by the unlerned, and sometumes also by the learned btUt disingenuous. On one occasion it was auoted by a theological disputant, when his opponent ask-ee him, "Did you not. mnow the verse is m'Go in the original Greek?" His reply ras rather singular; it was, "I did know it, but I ras not. aware that you did." (A laugh.) Tho people of the Uniteik "tates were so impressed with the importance of having the correct sense of the sacrediwrters made public that they hLad formed a society to revise the existing translation of the Bible. This body,whaichwas supplied with funids from volantary subscriptions, had gone through a considerable portiorL of the Old and New Testaments, the newversion being ;printed by them on the same page with the old translation, lD enLble the reader to judge between the two. It might be asked, why not form a voluntary society to carrv outf the sume object in this country, and thus avoid the necessity of applyig to Parliament on the subject? Hisanswer'was tati the work could be most efficiently done' aider the snpreme authority of the Crown, the labours of the comnmissioners appointed by whom, if imoertiLi and competent for' tiieirtask, as no doubtthey won!d be, would command the largest amount of public confidence. Opcosition to such an naderinking nmight be apprehended fran. the Bible iSociety; but that body would have timelynotsice of the intended change, and could easily diepose of all its copies in the oldverimon before the new one was ready for p blication. Eminent divines belonging to all the leading de zoiuinations of Christians were convinced of the necessity of the alteration now proposed, and it was to be hoped that dung theappioaching recoEs hon. members would csls wish the clergy and ministers of their respective neigliboarhoods on. thiis important rubject. Thu more public attention wvas called to the subject the more every reflecting mind mustfeel the urgencv , the revision he suggested. He could notreasonably expett that immediate seps iould be taken for' giving effect -to his views, but he bellaved that in no' more fitting aseembly than that of thhe representatives. of the people, coming from all parts of the Idndom, could so grave and serious a question be launcheL for full and fair discnssion. Trusting, therefore, that the ollect which he contemplated would gradually make itsway in public -favour, and be ultimuately accomplished to the satisfaction of the couEntry, he begged now to move them iesolution of -which he had given notice Sir G. PlECHELLi Eeconded the motion. Sir G. GREY,aid, the hon, gentleman had itimated that he did not inaend to take the sense of the House upoa. the rmotion, and he (Sir G. Grey) conceived that the House would do wrong to move in a matter of so much importance uIsess it was well, supported by public opinion. Mear.) For his own part, lie believed that the object of the anldress. [was not at all in- acceordance with the existing state of' public opinion (hevar, hear), and that 'te appointment of - eusu ha commission as thes;o .genle]man proposed would. czeae, geeraIl apprehension and alazmn and-wo3ld have 3- 'terden.y4 m5nttle the aithof t great body of the people, and to leseen their respect'ancd revetence for the aith6rizedL version of the 'Scripures. 'There were, no doubt6, ctaiia errors in the tranilatiqn of that version; it might contaim sonie words the meaning of 'which had -altered since the: data w'hen the -translition was r,niad; some Elight inaccuracies might be found iti it; bnt, speaking of it as a whole, le believed he expre.sed the general opinion of the Cl ristiau community ef this country when he said that, oving to the accuracy and'fidelity of the trnslaticn, and tothe pirity, beauty, and simplicity of itle lngusgo employed, it wasL 31usCly elltitled to-nthe ie-pect nmdi r*_everece lvih iv h it, had. been regarded.

The bill vrasthen read a third time. Some new clauses were proposed, but most of themw 'ere withdrawn or negatived. A discussion arose upon an amendment made in the clause giving compensation to retiring clerlks, whiah had been raised from one-fourth to one-third of their alaries, without notice, and upon this ground the amendment was cancelled. Tae bill then passed. On thebrder for the third reading of the VicePrefident of the Committee of Couhdll on Education Bill, ir. Hxxr.Ex objected to the introduction of another paid officer into the, House, and moved to' defer the third reading for three months. 3Mr. GLADSTON- supported this objection, and observed that they were going to give a bad constitution to the educational department. He thought theyz ought to now what duties this officer would have to discharge when not attending in Parliament. There was no standing business to justify the appolutmlent of such an official. In his opinion, it -would have been much better to appoint a joint secretary. Sir G. GREY defended the measure. The Goveriament, he said, were pressed -to place the adniinistration of the educational funds 'under the superintendence of one Minister, and to have the department of education represented in that House; this measure was therefore intended to meet -what' was understood to be the general vish of the House. After a discussion, in which MIr. NAFiEn, Mr. H. VExi,ox, Mr. HADFIUED, Mr. EInWOOD and Sir . GBn.4Ai took part, the House divided, when the third reading was carried by 77 against 35. The bil then, with some amendments, passed. The second reading of the Proctors in Ecclesiastical. Courts Bill, moved by Mr. IaDnriELD, was negatived. Tn the evenin", vMtr. M. Gissow inguired whether HsE MArxsrs's advisers contemplated the early appointment of a Minister from England to the United States. Lord PALAmnsto- replied that they had come to no dlecision upon the subject. Mr. EHyWOOD moved an address to the CnowVx for the appointment of a Royal Commission, consisting of learned men well skiUled in the original languages of the Holy Scriptures, and conversant with modern Biblical scholarship, to consider of sueh amendments of the authorized version of the BibIe as have been already proposed, and to receive suggestions from all persons who may be willing to offer them, and to report the amendments they may recommend. He assigned various reasons, including the :lauctuationsoftheverna:ulartongne,forbeliev-ng that the authorized versionx of the Bible did not reprsent the original text in an accurate form. Ee cited pFage in which, -he contended, the sensehad been ncorrectly rendered. Sir G. GPxv opposed the motion, thinldkn, as hÂ£r. HEYwOOD had admittedl, that the' House would do wrong to movein the matter without be;ng urged by public opinion, and he be.lieved that, so far fr om there beingr a desire for such an inquiry, it wouald creat;e great alarm. The authorized version of the Scriptures was, in his opinion, justly entitled to respect and reverence. Mr. HELYwooD witbdrew his motion. Mr. WI zxsox moved a resolution, " That, except upon the introduction of a measure to the House, no member do speak for more than half an hour at one time upon the same question, nor upon any occasion for more than one hour." He pressed the House to consider the amount of time wasted intedious speeches, and stated that there were 273 members who never spoke at all, and 209 who never exceeded half an hour; so that the monopoly of spealkng was confined to a very few members. Lc.rd PAxmsasrox said, in the abstract, the object which MIr. Wnnrsos had in view, that of shortening the debates in the House acnd increasing the amount of real business done, must meet the assentt of every member; but lie clid not think the particular method proposed, which would abridge the liberty of speech, and might be attended with greait practical mconvenience, was one he could recommend the House to adopt. He believed that, generally, members were not chargeable with abuse of speaking, and that there had I been much improvement in this respect of late years, there being a sort of control exerted by members who heard over those who spoke. There were subjects, however, upon which members should be allowed to go fully into the matter, and any restriction of this kind would very materially impede the enlightenment of the House upon those subjects. He agreed withiMr. WnKsoN tlhat a great deal of time was wasted, but he had not, he thought, hit the right nail upon the head. If there was anything that unnecessarily prolonged debates, it was not the length of speeches, but the number of speakers. He thought it was an abuse or evasion of the orders of the House to raise debates on F3idays upon the motion for diourrment. After some remarks by Mr. I. M_mns, MIr. W BIrGs, and Mr. Fox, who thought the evil might be mitigated if the leaders on both sides of the Home changed their habit of speaking at the end of the debate, the House divided, when the motion was negatived by 57 to 30. . Sir J. FnGruAmD rose to subnit the claims of certa:in of .H 3MfA.lsr sEubjects on the 'Spanish GovernTment for an honourable saettlement of the Spanish Committee Certificate of Coupon not Funded; and he moved- a resolution affirming the ustios of those clams. Lord PATrs:xsro=. concurred with Sir J. FtTzz GERua>0 in opinion that the course pursued Xi . Spanish Cortes and Government in regard totfeise claims was one quite at variance with the principiles of justice and good faith. In point of principle there could be no question in the mind of any honourable man; the oqly question was one of ex-pediency,-as to what course the British Government could tare that would be most likely tb obtain justice. The loan having been a,dvanei at the discreton and on the respoiiibmty tf private persons, the British Govemrment being Gno party, its offices were limited to friendly representations, which were accordingly made, but with. out succes Under these circumstances -he thought Sir JoHn would exercise a sound 1iscretion in not presing his .motion to a division. HeR thought Spainwould best coniult her natcional honour by making good her engagements with +.hose who-bad assisted her in the hour of need. The motion was withdrawn. Mr. ROrBucx moved a miolution, "That, the UNDEf-SaETsARY -for WAR having admitted that Upon anonymous infornation,; a iecret inquiry lad been ordeed into the ceonduct of a.

It is very hard to cal upon an innocent and disinterested person to endorse an equivocal act. The originator of the affair may be supposed to have counted the cost, and to have surrendered a few grains of conscientious scruple for a hundredweight of solid advantage or palpable convenience. That is his own affair, and he knows best whether he ihas made a good bargain. But it is mere gratuitous cruelty to come to some weak, *mresisting acquaintance, and ask him to sanction what he has never considered, what the first blush leads him to suspect, and what he lias really no interest in, except to keep his conscience stil sweet and clear. Now, are we to believe that the House of Coommons is really in the position of the simple friend, the easy good fellow, the verdant acquaintance, ready to put his signature to any document, and warrant any proceeding, however ambiguous? It is not the light in which we have hitherto regarded this body. Yet it is to be called on today to back up the House of Lords in a transaction admitted on all sides to have a most questionable character. At first we were told -there had been no negotiation with the retiring Bishops of LoznDox and DuxnAr the bill carefully suppressed all idea of negotiation; and when the correspondence was maoved for it was carefully kept out of the way tiU the bill had passed through committee and the proper time for considering the preamble had gone by. But, when the correspondence appeared at last, not only was the fact of a negotiation evident, not only did it now appear that these two unhappy prelates had actually offered to resign their sees on the condition, and only on the condition, of certain retiring pensions, but it was clear from what did appear that there was more that did not appear, and that there had been nobody knows how much negotiation. So this defence fell to the ground. Then it was alleged, with right legal subtlety, that though the two Bishops had proposed to do a thing contrary to the law, yet, as they had annexed the salvo "if it was not contrary," tleir consciences were clear. WYe don't think such a defence would hold in any case of improper overtures. Were a married gentleman to write a note to a married lady proposing to take steps to a union, if the law allowed it, the gentleman would hardly escape the charge of intentional adultery-at least, in the minds of decent people. Of course, the lawyers maintained that an act of Parliament would whitewash the whole affair, but the Bishop of Ox:oxD very rightly put the case of the bill not passing, but the episcopal overtures etanding on record against them. Yet it is obvious that the criminality of the transaction is not in the least affected by a subsequent indemnity, though, as it happens, the bill contains no such indemnity. Lord CAVFBETr, however, goes so far as to say that any proposition is lawful, if only there be annexed to it the sanctifyingformzua, "providing the assent of the Legislature can be " obtained." To pams over other palliatives, at the last moment, just before the division upon the third reading of the bill, the LoRD CH"c=on adroitly throws in a hint for the special benefit of the Com- mons below, that, after all, as he is at present advised,I the terrible act of Eiz.&Bxr=, 31, cap. 6, does not apply to Bishops, and is aimed at smaLer fry, lesser dignit3ries, and the parochial clergy. * But what a defence to make for two pillars of ,ustice and truth-lights of Apostolic doctrine and purity-fathers of the land ! This last touch alone was wanting to place the transaction in its proper light, and to throw aproper light, we are bound to add, on the existing bharacter of episcopacy. yell, it is very true that the LonD CHA?Cm=On bears witness to an ancient belief that Ghurch laws 'were not made for great Churchmen. -" The nearer the church the further "' from GOD." L YoOU wished to see the worst of IRome you must go to Rome, and more than half the Reforniers were made by the conduct of appeals at that court. The magnet points everywhere with rigid, uniformity, except at the pole itself, where it talters and vacillates. It is the comaon talk of the country clergy that there is never a job buit it is hatched in the Bizhop7, palace. While the small people are trimming their small waYs to their small tether, consulting acts of Parliament, Clergymeegs Assista-is, and Bun'es EcdcsiaZ Law, the bold big offender laughs at the hard letter of the law, and rejoices in the Christian liberty which reveals to-him its more- genial spirit. The laws of the Church, so far, at least, as coneers all matters akin to that before us, press heavily upon the scrapu. lolls conscience. The least approach to traffic, to pecuniaxy compensation, if only; to rectify the lbalance of an exchange, S almosti any arrangement I that domestic convenience maj' naturally suggest, retirement with any conditions, temporary resignation under any circnmstancem whatever, bring' all the parties concerned under the imputation. of simony,-the most dreadful crime a- clergyman can commit. It is caUed simony if a presentee in the most casual way acquiesces beforehand in any claim that his patron may happen to make. It is'called simony if in an exchange a difference of. 1001. a-year is balanced with money.- Many convenient arrangements cannot even be thought of, as they would bring the people concorned within point-blank range of this anathema. There are sensitive clergymen who have even, for conscience sake, resigned to their Bishops the next presentations, purchased for 'them by their kind relatives; and those presentations have been accepted. But it is very notorious that all these scruples are laughed at in the Bishops' palaces. There the mart is always open. The very notion -of simony, and the supposed analogy to the crime of SrsoN MaGc,s, is an absurd superstition. It might be asked why a superstition is retained, and even enforced by moral terrors anc pecuniary penalties, by those who despise it; but the question would argue small knowledge of human nature. Nine-tenths of the superstitions in the world are maintained by unbelievers. Indeed, a superstition is never dropped so long as there is found a sufficient number to accept it. Only-and it is the very thing that has happened in this instance-now and then we have a peep behind the scenes. A curtain lifts up, and the archpriests of the idol. are discovered maling a joke of his wooden majesty. Bishops, at least, don't believe in simony. Few sensible men ever thought they did. The Bishop of O.XPoRD very dutifuilly attempts to throw a veil over the frailties of the venerable prelates, and intimates that they had been given to expect a general measure, and that they only meant to resign their Bishoprics in the event of such a measure passing. No doubt, a measure of this sort has been intended, and is intended; but is postponed for the same reason that it has been postponed a hundred times. There are not many noble or other patrons of the Church who wish to see its duties and endowments distributed on the basis of common sense. One begins to make provision for cases of incapacity, and in breach of a system the very genius of which is to recognize no such thing as incapacity. One clergyman, one Bishop, is as good as another, and, once installed, knows no change or decay. Common sense dictates that the ministry of the Church should be conducted like that of every other institution or department; that the officers should be distributed according to their qualifications and merits; that when a man is no longer adequate to the duties of his office he should be superseded; that when the work is too much for, one it should be subdivided; that there should be a real and active superintendence, of a nature to compel all the clergy to do their duty; that the man who did his work well should be advanced to a higher charge, and so forth. There is nothing of this. It all now rests with the conscience of the clergyman, be he Bishop or curate, and there is not much even to teach and inform his conscience, if he be ever so desirous of knowing his duty. The mass of the clergy are groping in the dark, knowing well they ought to be doing more than they are now, but not knowing exactly what it is that is wanting. As for the Bishops, we are now told that a Bishop's work is over for the year in July, and the only reply Lord Sms.rrrsntm made to this statement was that his friend the Bishop of LosDow had stil a great deal of work to do at all times of the year, looking to the estates of his see. This ought not to be, as there is no evidence tnat the enemy of the human race takes a summer's tour and keeps abroad till Christmas BHp never sleeps. lWhat is wanted, then, is such a superintendence as there is in everybusiness or everydepartment of State,-everybody, high and low, kept to his work; the work and the staff freely adjusted to one another; and every other guarantee taken that the work be really done. It will be long before we see this. It is some other ideal that possesses high ecclesiastical circles. We see the vein crop out in this case. We shaU not describe it, but it is something very different from that primitive and almost rnstic scrupulosity that possesses all the clergy who have not courage to think for themselves.
The Indian debate of 3Ionday night seems to us to have been, upon the whole, the most satisfactory that we have had since the House, at the su-ggestiorn of Sir C. WOOD, returned to the practice of setting aside one night in the session for the consideration of the affairs of our Indian empire. So languid have been the debatwes, and so slight has been the interest hitherto felt in them, that the presence of even 30 or 40 members must be considered a very great advance, while the tone of the discussion was such as to convince every one that there exists in the House of Commons a sincere and ardent desire to acquit itself worthily of this mighty trust, and to do all that its means of knowledge place at its disposal towards developing the latent resources of the country, and drawing forth the latent energies of its inhabitants. The storm that recently lowered over the relations between the Board of Control and the East India Directors seems completely to have passed away, and to have left fair weather behind it. Sir J A2S HOGG has ceased to be vituperative and Mr. VERsON SsrTH to be recriminative, and the rival Powers of Leadenhall-street and Cannon-row are, for the present at least, restored to the best understanding. We have no wish to revive old disputes, and shall therefore gladly turn to the details of Indian administration as disclosed by 3Mr. VEaNsox S3ur, leaving the question of Indian government to that solution which it is sure to receive at another, and that no distant, day. The first thing that strikes us is the incurable confusion in which Indian accounts are involved. Either the principle upon which those accounts are made out is extremely defective or lhe details are misstated to a degree which makes them absolutely useless as means of information with regard to the financial position of the Government. The case stated by Sir E. PERRnY-and, as far as we know, quite ananswered-proves this to demonstration. The expenditure on public works is stated by Lord DI)AuarE at 2,500,0001. for 1853-4, and by the Board of Control at considerably under 1,000,0001. Of this discrepancy no solution whatever is offered. But this is not all: the Government of India is thoroughly conscious of its deficiencies in this respect, and has applied to the Engliahs Government to send them out a first-rate accountanf; to put their books into such order that they .may become -what they are not now-true records; of their financial transactions. Never was a miore reasonable request. But the Court of Directors felt that to send out an accountant would be a reflection on the book-keeping of the best of all po-sible serv:ees, and therefore referred the GoVm-i;on_G uER to the assistance he could obtain in India, as being, in spite of his own experience to the contrary, quite sufficientto reformn the public accounts of the empire. The. aOUntat was not sent, and theb 1ndiae $xecutive mcust go 3on wit:h accounts wrong one way or another on the single. item of :.ublic Worbs to the extent of 1,5OO,OOOI., because the court of. Diree-: tors cannot afford to admit the :truth that they have not in India' 'accountants capable of digesting. their receipts and .expenditure under proper heads, and balancing'their books at the end of the year.: .Another subject on which much dissatisfaction was justly felt is the treatment of the Law Ceonmission. The story is soon told :-Some 16 or 17 years ago a Commission, presided over by Mr. AIMAULAY, prepared a code of criminal law for India, one of the most grievous wants felt by its population having long been a clear, rational, and humane system. This work, which bears in every clause the impress of the genius of its accomplished framer, was executed -with a grasp of mind, a vigour, 'and a boldness which took away the breath of LIdian officials, well used to tame and diffuse mediocrity, but not to the treatment of a subject of the kind in such a manner and with such novelty and power. Markthe result; From that day to this the report of Mr. MAcAuLAY has been bandied backwvards and forwards between the Imperial and local Governments of India, and all that Mr. Vxuioir Sy= can now say on the matter is that there are some hopes at last of getting some of it passed into a law.. There were also reports of numerous law Commissions, formed at irmmense expense, which had met with a similar fate, while al this time the people of India are living under the worst possible law, and the Indian Government doing little or nothing to help them. In 1853, when the Charter was renewed, a new Commission was formed, at the head of which were placed the MASTER of the Ross, the C}TrF JusTicn of the.ComiIox PLxAs, and Sir EDWARD RYAts, and they entered on their duties, as we are assured, with the full understanding that what they decided was to be adopted, and was in no respect to meet with the fate of Mr. MALAuiv's crimiinal code. They, after two years' labour, produced a report, of which we gave some account at the time when it appeared, and of which we may certainly say that it deserved a better fate than it seems awaited it. No sooner, however, was this report complete-nay, while it was yet incomplete -than the jealousy of the Indian Government was excited, and they who had so long slept over the matter set to work with surprising energy to do for themselves the work that the Commission was doing for them. The result was, as might have been anticipated, a very inferior production to that of the able judges, lawyers, and civilians who formed the English Comnission. Violent objections were made by the Court to carrying the report of the Commission at once into efect, and, in deference to these representations, the report and code, bearing the signature of two English Judges and one Indiau Chief Justice, have been sent to Calcutta, that the Judges and civil servants of the Company mnay criticize its contents, and point out its inapplicability to India; or, as Mr. VERrioNx Sinv expresses it, may " sit in error" upon it. For this also there is no excuse to be given, except the strong feeling which exists among the civil service and the Judges in India, which renders it necessary to sacrifice to them the good faith of the Government and the respect due to the labours and position of the Commissioners. We have selected these two instances-that of the accountant and of the Commissionbecause they both serve to ilustrate the same fault in the present Indian Minister-a too great deference for what is most improperly caUed Indian public opinion. To Mr. YE=ow Su= we attribute the very best intentions; of the sincerity of his desire for the improvement of the natives there is no doubt; but he seems afraid to follow his own impulses, and far too ready to give up his own views at the bidding of Indian opinion and its representatives in this country. Now, Indian opinion in the proper sense of the wordthat is, opinion of the govemed classes in India -does niot exist at all, and the counterfeit which we mistake for it is only the opinion of the servants of the Company-the governing class themselves. Opinion in India is *against the reduction of salaries, because the classes who pay them have no means of expressing an opinion. Opinion in India is against competition for civil I appointments, because it is the opinion of those who hold them by patronage. Opinion in India is against sending out an accountant, because it is the opinion of the many bad accountants who are there already. Opinion in India is against the Law Commission, because it is regarded as an infraction of the privilege of the service to do everything for India tthemselves. All this is quite natural; but it is neither natural nor right that a M1inister on whose shoulders this heavy trust is laid should suffer himself to be governed by the opinions of those who are bound to submit to his decision, and who view every measure proposed for the benefit of India through the medium of class prejudices and personal ambition.
The Report of the Chelsea Court of Inquiry has been delivered to the House of Commons, and in a few days will be in the hands of all persons who may be at the pains of reading this document as a serious State paper. We warn the public beforehand to expect nothing from it. All the officers, even those most deeply incriminated, will be whitewashed as a matter of course. The Board wiU then have discharged its duty in a way to earn for its members the approval at least of their military superiors. We do not, of course, mean that these gentlemen have given any decision which did not seem to them perfectly justifiable under the circumstances of the case, but this only proves that they are men of the same calibre as the officers who suffered the Crimean army to melt away under their hands. What L-ucAN, CABxDiGAo, AiRVY, GOnRDON did, WOODFOBD, BERcOHA3iP, KNoLLYs, &c., approve. In the same position they would have acted in the same manner. Should this country be ever again engaged in hostilities we have at least the comfort of knowing the names of certain officers who cannot be inthusted with the command of our armies. Before turning to the Report itself, it will be well to call the attention of our readers to the flood of light which has been tnrown -upon it [by the disclosures of . the J-uDcn-ADvocAxE on I Monday night. Lord LUCAAN, with his usual discretion, had hit upon the notable plan of abusing theM sn-n orWAr., theJuDGE-AOvocATs, and the Chelsea Court, by way of bettering his case. Some special censure which he bestowed upoi. Mr. C. ViLasXns had the very natural effect of irritating that gentleman into reply. As to the fairness of the Report, Mr. C. Vm a told the House of Commons " that he had learnt that every one " of the General officers at Chelsea was of the " same political party as the Earl of LucAsn. And, "besides that, there was a gentleman who ated "as private Secretary to Sir ABx.Nn-Dnr. WooD"rOPD who was in the room the whole time when "the doors were closed, who, as he believed, was "a private friend, and, as he knew, was a strong Ipolitical partisan of the noble lord, so that he "had everything in his favour; and the noble "loi& judges, they who iried. him, and who cs judged and acquitted him, were all his own poli" tical partisans." It is no betrtyal of confidence to caRllattentiontothis remarkablepasageintheJDGnELvADvooA's speech, as it was delivered iu the open House. I`rom it there result two coiclusionsfrstj Lord Lucaw is acquitted a and secondly, Ie is acquitted.by.his own political friends and par. tisans. This, hovwever, is not al; for,-as we.read on, we find that the JIIB ADvocArxT informed the House of ComniJas that, in itus opinion, in Lora . LvcA's ca3e the inquiry was "incomplete" and the evidence "i isuflicient." We produce his vervwords, lest the partisans of -the prescnt military system should tax us withl exaggeration :-' I am bound "to say I believe that, however incomplete the "inquiry and isltnwffliet t evidenx reight have 'been in Lord 1Liucxi's case, yet the General "officers, looking to what-evidence they!had to "decide upon, have given a just verdict." We accept 31r. YaVUMss's testimony as to the fact-we demur to his conclusion. Lord LucAN, was the only one of the Crimean officers who has been so silly as to quarrel with his judges, and he has his reward. But, if the inquiry was "incomplete" and the evidence " insuffi" cient" in his case, what was it in that of Sir RicHAPuD AREu ? When the conduct of this officer was called in question Colonel TuLoon had been compelled by bodily infirmity to retire from the court. Sir RcIOHA1D ArEY had it all his own way; he stated his own case, called his o-n witnesses, cantered at his own pleasure over the course, and declared that; he had won the race. There was nobody to oppose him, which rendered his viceory less ?lorious, if more complete. Even so his statements consisted mainly of (leclarations that the Crimean Commissioners had exceeded their duty in reporting at all upon his shortcomings and of excuses for doing nothing. He has teen acquitted upon his own ex parte statements by a board of gentlemen who, by education, prejudice, feeling, and political predilections, are just so many repetitions of himself. The inquiry, as conducted, has been but a sorry commentary upon our existing rili-- tary system. We are absolutely without a court of appeal-without a shadow of remedy, when the treasure of the nation has been wasted and the blood of our bravest countrymen shed in vain through the incompetence of the officers in chief command.

HER MAJBS7r2S THEATRE. Rossini's Tancredi was produced lst night, after having been laid aside for many years Ihis opera seria-the ninth dramatic work of its composer--was written for the Carnival at Venice, and bronght out with extraordinary success at the Fenice, in 1S13. Rossini was then in his 21st Year. He had attained a certain degree of celebrity; but Tancredi at once made Ii m famous. The Venetians hailed another Cimarosa in the young composer, whose new contribution to the theatre fairly turned their heads. From high to low every inhabitant of the " City of the Sea" was eternally humming "M Mi rivedrai, ti rivedro," or luxuriating in the melody of " Di t2nti palpiti." Taencredi was intro. duced to 1onden four years later, at the King's Theatre, for -. Madame Bellocehi (or Belloc), whose name is now forgotten by the world atl la;ge, but whvo will be recognised by musical antiquaries as the celebrated Nina of Paissello, and thoprima donna for whom Rossini wrote not only his early o-era iuffa, called L'Inganno Felice, but his more renowned Gzza Ladra (in 1817). The first great sensation, nevertheless, created by Tancreai in England was when. Pasta assumed the character of the hero (in 1825) nd achieved, as every one knows, one of her most brlliant triumphs. Since Pasta, tho Syracusan warrior has been variously impersonated, with more or less success, by Mialibran, Pauline Garcia (her sister-now nadame Visrdot), Brambilla, and last of all by Alboni-at the Royal Italian Opera, in 184S. Tancredi fwas revived expressly for Mademoiselle Wagner, whose im. personation of the hero is famous in her native land; but it is worthy of remark thiat the four prin. dpal parts last night were all ELlotted to singers who, not being Italianls, may be set down without offence, at the Itarian Opera, as foreigners. Under these circumstances, it is highly creditable to Mademoiselle Wagner (Tancredi), Mademoiselle Bauer (Amenaide), Herr Reichardt (Argirio), and M. Bouch6 (Orbazzano) that the opera should have been performed throughout to the evident satisfaction of the audience, whose applause was so inces. snt that, at intervals, it might havo been arraigned by scrupulous connoisseurs as indiscriminate. Mademoiselle Wagner "looked" the personage of Trn credi just as magnificently as she did that of Romeo in I Montecdhi eed r Capuleii, and did hersutmost with it, too, in a histrionic sense-alt,hough it can scarcely be said to afford materials for the exhibition of fine acting. Madame Pasta, we are told, made a grand tragic part of Tancredi; butthis is one of the trditions connected with that eminent dramatic singer which ought to be received with caution. Judged fromeamusical pointofviewthe performanceof Mademoiselle Wagner may be described as genuine Tedescan, shining rather in declamatory force than in those fine traits of vocalization which belong almost exclusively to the old Italian style (of which the opera itself is a model), and remarkable more for energy and bread.Lh of conception than for other qualities. The rmusic, it is true, belongs to a school which has pretty nearly died out for want of singers, and was composed at a period when nearly all contralti and en.-zi soprani were supposed to be gifted with that fluency of execution of which the earliest and latest examples in our time have been presented by Brambilla and Alboni. Thus Mademoiselle Wagner was always most at home where large and expressive decla:mation is demanded, and least so where the music, being florid or ornamental, a certainfinesse in the management of ,7rupeUi and in the delivery Of roulades and bravutra passages is indispensablo. In the aria d'in?rata, the accompiamed recitative, "0 patria dolce ed ingrata," was far superior, for instance, to the mode7ato movement, " Tn che acceadi," and to the familisrcarbaetta, " Di tanti palpiti"-since the last two depend chiefly for effect npon vocal qualifications in which Mademoiselle Wagner (like the majority of her compatriots) is deficient. Her most dtrilin.g performance during the evening was the duet with Argirio, "Ah se del mali niei," in which she was seconded most efficiently by Herr Hdeihardt. This raised the audience to enthusi: mcm; and not only was it followed; by a loud anda unanimous encore, but byn general call for the singers at the conclusion. The air introduced by MademoiseUe Wagner at the end of the opera was not so well suited to her peculiar powers; and the curtain fell to a demonstration somewhat less genial and hearty then that which f oUowed the termination of the first act, and the duet to 'vhich allusion has been made. MademoiseUe Bauer shoved good qualities now and then in her executionof the music of Amenaide,and considerable command of bra'tura in She recitative and air (Act IL) "GranDio," wheretheunfErtunateprince.sappealstoHeaven on behalf of her newly fouad champion.

The rampant golden lion of Belgium, vwith the vast famly; of lions (likewvise. rampant) that belong to the various provinces of the kIdngdom, strike the eye at every point. In England the results of the heralds' art have an exotic look about, them, and seem to harmonize but indifferently with surrounding actualities. Here we -live for the nonce in the very region of blazonry, where everythitg is in perfect keeping, and the wildest heraldic fiections, interspersedwithallegories in classical taste, acquire a substantial existence, by the aide of which the marks of the 19th century fade into i- significance. Let it be emphatically added, that all the temporary edifices, which it would occupy whole columns to describe, are as carefully executed (though the materials are perishable), as if they were intended to form the perm=nent ornaments of a city peoplel with the mnost fistidious inhabitants. Experience has so'completely taught the Brit,on to imagine that all temporry edifices nstnecessarily belong to the "gilt gingerbread" sehool of art, that he could hardly imagine the brilliancy, devo.d of tawdry vulgarity, the solidity Of grandeur that has been obtained in this fine old ;own. Triumphal arches have been raised at the Porte cle Lacken, at the top of the Mfontagne de la Cour, at the entrance of the Rue Royale, and at the entrance of the Rue Guimard. By observing these p)oints on a map of Brussels the reader will easily be able to form an idea of the route taken by the King on proceeding from his palace at Lacken to the Place St. Joseph, which is situated without the boundaries of the town near the Boulevard du R6 gent. All the streets through which he has to pass are profusely adorned with banners suspended from ropes stretched across the road, and the constant repetition of the Belgian tricolor (black, yellow, and red), produces a remarkably rich effect. Wreaths and escocheons at the windows and along the walls of the houses are also to be seen in the greatest abundance. It is worthy of remark that the present route is the one taken by the Wing, on the 21st of July, 1831, when he made his entree into Brussels. The great ceremony of this day was the ceremony in the Place St. Joseph, where the King received deputations from all the important bodies in his dominions. The side of the Place, which is to the left hand of a spectator stationed on the church st-eps, is occupied by a large temporary building, gorgeousy fitted up in the classic style, and richly decorated with hangings of cimson and gold, escocheons of the provnces, and emblemnatical figures. This edifice is divided into nine compartnents, the centre of which is occupied by the gTrgeous throne, while the other eight have been devoted to the legishltive and judicial fuintionaries of the kingdom. and Theli ladies. In front of the church a broad platform is raised for the Archhiahon Cardinal of Maltes and .th provincial bishope andy on the opposite side of the Place stands an altar, surmounted by a picture of St. Joseph, under a ai)lenldid canopy. Towards noon the Place do St. Joseph gradually began to fill with al! the representative personages of the country, including deputations from all the regiments. Shortly before 1 o'ock a salute announced that the n had entered the city by the Porte do Lacuen (otherwise called the Porte d'Anvers) where he was received by the iBurgomaster and the P cheius. His cor tege wasu composed tbus:-A detachment of the civic gard on hor back, theor inge s ctyeirsg the delegates OI the Central Commission of the fyles, two of the Keing's Offlciers d'Ordo annnce the King, the Dure of Brabant, the Count of Flandres, the Aides-deCamp a nd Officiers d'Ordonnance of the King and the Princes; the Generals, the suDerior officers and the staff ofnthr cii gue ad the army; four piqueurs on horseback; aS carriage drawn by sis horses, containing the Grand Marshal of the Court; the Grand Chamberaine (lteatrt de da oaneisoi) of the oyal Hnousehold; a second carriage and six, containirn the aoahe byathesse of the Household of the Duke and Duchess of Brabant, the Ladies of Honour, and the Ladies of the Palace; a third carriage and six, containing the Duchess of Brabant and the Princess Charlotie, and attended on one side by the colonel commanding the depart ment of Grand Euyer-on thetheher by the aidedc-Camp de Se-vice. The whole procession terminated with a detachment of cavalry. At the Rue Guimasrd the Kin was received by the Presidents of the Legislative Assembles and by the Ministes, and at the Boulevard du Regent the sceuge alignhted, and amid the most eafening acecla- ations the King proceeded on foot to t throne ithe Plaee St. Joseph, where he took his seat, with the Duchess of Brabant on one side and the Princess Charlotte on the other. After a cantata, coimposed by M. Tonis, and su by a chorus stationed on an especial platform, the addresses of the Leniasative Assemblies were presented to the King on the part of both aemblies, and the Mineister of the Interior laid before him the medals struck in honour of the occasion. This ceremony i was followed by the solemn singing of the ele Deure , preOionsly to which the Bishops had passed over from their gallery in front of the church to the altar opposite, and the clergy hed formed themselves into two lines across the Place seas to make a passage for the ecclesiastical dignitaries. The intonation of the T. Deurn, which was foilowed by Donowcmp, oSaeum fac sepear, the solemn aspect of the priesthood and the altar, the various unifobms of the soldiers, the truly popular Monarch on his throne, the enthusiastic multitulde pressing around the space, and the bright sunshine, bwhich after three days' drizne seemed to come out purposely for the occasion, maderup a commerei which the most vviid imagination could scarcely rearlze. On Wednesday, when the allegorical cars from every province will pass along the streets, we shall have a more fanciful exhibition; hut the ce.remonyof to-dayis especially interestmngfrom the proof it gives of hearty sypathy between a Sovereign and his people, and of the general feeling of gratitude for a period of tranquillity that has nbted 2a years. ihen the clergy had returned to their orignmal platform the deputations of the civic 'uard and the |army defiled in columnbefore thethronie, and shortly after they had retired-that is to say, soon after 4 o'clock-the cortfge, which accompanied the King to his Palace, wvas in motion.

TiEE ABG(DOsNr MuitDER.-MNxa TarTant, who was convicted at the lst assizes at Abingdon on the charge of mnrdering herinfant, aged three months, is to be executed at the top of Eeadirg gaol oniFriday next. Since her conviction she has paid earnest attention to the rpligious instractions of the chaplain, the Rev. John Field. As the evidence failed to show that there were any of those features of deliberation and brutality wbich ha.ve characterized previsus cases in which reprieves ha.ve been granted to the culpnits, the public are now exerting themselves to, obtain, on her behalf, a commutation of the sentence. The chfld, it wall be rememhered, waes buried in a field, and, when fourd, it had a fracture on the upper part of the left aide of the head, which 'he surgeon alleged to be the cause of death. The woman now denies the murder, andsstates that the body was buried by the man with whom she cohabited. When the child was missed, and:the police made inquiries, the woman at firt denied having had a child, but afterwards admitted that she had, but said it died of thrush, and named the place where it was buried. This- circmnstance is pointedoutto t'he Secretary of State as favourable to the convict - an& ag all the witnesses proved her to have been lkind to tie child up to the last moment of her being seen with it, they conceive this to be a point worthy of rmerciful considera4tion.

FRANOE (:'Rois ow owx coRrrEsPoNDxlT.1 PARIS, MrsAY, JULY 21,6 Pf.S The French papers begin to teem with details of -the conflict at Madrid, many of them differihg from each other so widely as to be wholly irreLoncilable. It is alwavs difficuit to get at the exact particulars of an insurrection and. street fight of this kind, but it is certain that some of the correspondence published is far indeed from the truth. A great number of private letters have, however, been received from MIadrid by Spaniards a-nd others resident in Paris, and the contents of these prove that there was much more bloodshed than is admitted by the partisans and proteS of O`DonnelL It is untrue that the National Guards desisted from the fight before they were worsted and compelled to do so. They seem to have fought pretty well, considering that they vere attacked by about an equal force of regular trcops, against -which tivic volunteers, xnless the.r numerical superiority be very great, can rareiy hope to contend with much chance of ultiumate success. One battalion, the 3d Light Infanbty, composed chieflv of men who madethemseives remarkablefor their duing in July, 1854, fought desperately. According to various letters, 8W0 or 380 of them shut them'selves up in a house and made a fierce resistance, killing and wounding 1I0 of the battalion of regulars that assailed them. Overcome at last, they and their leader, Sisto Camara, were all killed. The two Escosuris were very active on the popular side. The ex-M1inister, Patricio, is an old soldier, and served in the artillery of the Spanish army ir thle time of the Carlist war. Be is said to have found an asylum at the British Fmbassy. As yet ve have no account of the fate of his b. other Narci o. Ihe 3d Tight Battalion and the D, mocrats seem to have borne the brunt of the battle and to have met merciless foes when the day turned against them. The -work appears to have been done in a manner efiectual enough to satisfy even the ruthless O'Donnell, wLo was doubtless resolved to g,ive the Nationals a shap lesson; and, if the accounts we receive be true, Mfadrid must nowr be full of mourning. The real number of dead is not known, and perhaps never will be, but I bave heard it roughly estimated, on the strength of le'ters from MIadrid, at 1,000, including soldiers aiad civilians, and people say there has been no such slaughter, in the way of street fig,htipg, since June, 1848, in Paris. In this there may possibly be exaggeration, but there has certainly been a good deal of bicodahed. Jose Munos (Pucheta), the bullfighter, fought with a valour which, displayed against a foreign foe, -would have won him a herors chaplet. As it is, he wiU doubtless long be remembered as a her) in the annals of his party, although set down as a desperate rebel and assassin by his opponents. This man, although his impromptu executions of Chico and one or two other persons in July, 1854, were unquestionably murders (however much the victims may have merited their fate), rendered good service on more than one occasion, and especially on the day succeeding the flight of Maria Christina from Mladrid, when it was mainly by his influence that the barrios bajos, or low ouarters, near the Toledo-gate, were kept quiet and bloodshed was prevented. According to the latest intelligence frcm Madrid, :E-partero, whose abode, since his resignation, had been the Gurreas' house, had left the capital, with a cavalry escort, by the gate of Alcala. There can be no reasonable doubt that he was virtually a prisoner. It is not known whither ho was proceediug. The gate oI Alcala opens on the Saragosma read, and by it, now just two years ago, he saude his triuniphal entry into Madrid amid the enthusinstic acclamations of the entire population. Not a window on his passage but was crowded with women, waving handkerchiefs and throwing flowers, and the people andNationalGuards thronged around hInm, eager to touch his dress, or even the carriage in -which he stood upiight while malkig his famous s; cech, and declaring that if the liberty that had just been re-conquered was ever again menaced his sword should spring from the scabbard to defend it. Ncne will accuse Espartero of want of personal courage, aud doubtless at this, as at the many other eventful epochs of his life, he has pursued the line of conduct his conscience dictated to him ; but the world, which judges by acts, ani-I dces not always inquire into motives, will ba apt to tax hiM= with singular apathy in the recent critical ci0 cum-tances. It is to be observei that although Espartero left Madrid on the side leading to Arragon, it is highly improbable that he wouldi be conducted or allowed to proceed far in that direction. His having taken it at all may be explained by the fact that the house in which he v'as residing is not far from the Alcala gate, and that he wou-ld have to traverse no populous streets in order to get out of the town. Once outside, a small ciruit would talke him into the CAtaIle road. It has lbeen conjectured that the intcntion of the Government was to send hiim to Fiance. Alt the acco'-ts r2ceived from Spaia up to tbis afternoon describe the tranouillity of Madrid as perfact. alnd say there is no apprehension of its beimg a,aina troublhd. The dose of lead and steel administered to the people of that iunlucky capital arpears to have been abundantly strong to keep tleni quiet for awhile. All is quiet also in the po0 inces, as far as is known. T he slight disturbrnces at Barcelona began at 5 in the evening of the 18th, and recommenced (after having been supp:e ed) on the morning of the 19th. Barricades were thrown Up on the Rambla and elsewhere, but were quickly taken and destroyed by the troops. There was some firing, but we have not heardwhether There was loss of life, and the whole affiair appears to have been trifling. Reports of disturbances in G-alicia are contradicted. The Basque Provinces are stated tobe sotranquil, and likely to continue so,that G>eneral Echague h1as been able to move his troops towards Tadela, in o.der to observe Arragon. If that province he alone in its opposition to the Go'vertnent, it is the opinionx even of those who sympathize with its cause that its resitance will soon be overceme. - The portion of the circular of M. Cantero, the new Minister of Finance, relating to the desarnortinrcion, in which he announces that the operation is to be actively continued, and enlarges on its benefits to tffe country, has excited some disapprobation on the part of his colleagues, who appear to consider the declaration neither necessary nor timely. The telegraphic communication between Madrid and the French frontier is still interrupted at Saragossa, and our latest news now comes by post. There is talk of reverting for the moment to the old lino of semaphores, which is still in good working condition. I am informed that the additionial Frrench troops sent to the frontier, in consequence of the state of Spain, 'vill not exceed a brigade, but that a ship of war has been ordered to go and crazs off Cadiz, and another off Barcelona.

The departure of Sir William Codringtoun was to take place six or eight days later." The Emperor has addressed the following letter toi 61. Rouher, ihe Minister of Public Works 5"Monsieur le Ministre,-After havnng examined with you | the ravages caused by the inundations, my first object of consideration has been to find the means for preventing similar disasters. Accordizng to wshat I saw, there are intiie. gre3test number of the localities secondary works, indicated by the nature of the ground, and which skilful engineers might readily execute. Thus, nothing can be more easy than to construct works of art wnich would temporarily preserve from such inundations cities such as Lyons, Valence, A-ig. non, Tarascon, Orleans, Blois, and Tours. But as to a general system, to be adopted in order to protect for the future from such terrible scourges our rich valUeys traversed by large rivers, that is stiU wanting, and must be absolutely and immediately found. " At the present time every one calls for a dyke, being satisfied with diverting the water from himself and throwing it on his neighbour. The system of dykes is only a palliative, ruinous for the State, and imperfect for the in terests to be protected; for, in g&neral, the sand which is brought down_ constantly elevating the bed of the rivers, and the dikes tending to narrowv them, it is necessary to be constantly adding to the height of those dykes, to be prolonging them along both banks, and to subject them to a constant superintendence. This system, which, for the Rhoue alone, would cost more than 100,000,000f., would be insufficient, for it would be impossible to obtain that tmn interrupted surveillance along the whole extent of the baaks which could alone prevent a rupture; and, should one dyke break-, the catastrophe would be the more terrible as the dykes would have been raised higher. In the midst of all the systems proposed one alone appears to me to be reasonable, practicable, of ready execution, and which, moreover, has experienre in.favour of it. " Before seeking the remedy for an evil it-is necessary to study well its cause. Whence, therefore, proceed these sudden risings of our large rivers? They are caused by the rain which faUs on the mountains, and hut slightly by that which falls on the plains. This is evident fron the fact of the rise of the Loire having been felt at Roanne and at Nevers 20 or 30 hoes before it reached Orleans or Blois. It was the same with the Saore, the Rhone, and the Gironde; and during the late inundations the electric telegraph served to announce to the people, several hours, or rather several days, beforehand, the precise moment of the rising of the watr,rs. " ThIS phesomenon may be readily understood. When the rais fals on a plain the ground serves as a kind of sponge, and the -water, before reaching the river, has to traverse a vast extent of soft ground, the gentle slope of which also retards the running off of the water, But when, independ. eritly of the melting of the snow, the same thing takes place on the mountains, where the ground, mostly rocky or gravelly, does not absorb the moisture, the steepness of the cos rtry camries the water rapidly to the rivers, which thus suddenly rise. This is what we see every day when it rains. The rain which falls in our fields seldom Â£eormsa stream, bht that which fall on the roofs of honses, and which runs iLto tl:e gutters,Iinstantly becomes streams. Thus the roo's are th e mountans, and the gutters the valleys. If we, therefore, suppose a valey four leagues long by two wide, and that there has fallen in the 24 hours lOc of rain on that surface, we shall have in the same space of time 12,SOO,O0O cubic mretres of water, which will have run into the river; and this phenomenon will be renewed for each of the tributary streams of that river. Suppose, therefore, that the Rhone or the Loire has ten large tributory streams, we shall have the immense volume of 128,000,000 cubic metres of water which wil have mn into the river in 24 hours ; but if rlatvolume of watercan be keDt back in such a manner that its running off must occupytwice or thrice the space of tiD]e, then, as m.ay be readily conceived, the inundation will be rendered twice ort'criceless dangerous. **Ever) thin. therefore, consists in retarding the running cff of the w} ater. The means of effecting this is to erect on all the tributary streams of rivers, at the mouths of the v weirs, leaving in the centre only a narrow passage ,'or the waters, and thus keeping them back when their v lume increases, and forming reservoirs which could only empty themselves slowly. It is necessary to do on a small scale what nature has done on a large one. If the lake of Corstance and the lake of Geneva did not exist, the valley of the Rhine and that of thle Rhone would only form to % ast sheets of water; for every year the abovementloned la,es, without any extraordinary fall of rain, and merely frorm. the melting of the snow, rise fromtwoto three metres, which makes for the lake of Constance an increase of alb,.ut two and-a-half milliards of cubic metres of water, ar d for that of Geneva an augmentation of 1,770,000,000. it- may be conceived that with this immense volume of water, if it were not kept back by the mountains which at the tpeniag of those two lakes cheek it, and only allow it to s un off according to the breadth and depth of the river. a faightful inundation 'would take place every year. Thisnatural inundation was followed, more than 1511 years ago, by electing in the Loire a weir, the ntility of which is shown by the report madetotheChamberinl1847by 5L Col'i&non, then deputy of the Meurthe, and which is as ful ows:- " The dike of Finay, constructed in 1711, is about seven miles above Roinne. This work, resting on the rocks wiich close in the valley, and enveloping the remains of an old blidge, which, according to tradition, -was built by the oromans, reduces the opening of the river at this point to a width of 20 metres; its height above the ordinary level is also 20 metres, and it is through this kind of sluice that the w hole LIoire is compelled to pass at the time of the greatest irnundation. The influence of the dyke of Pinayis the nore worthy of attention that it waserected, asshown by thedecrce of the Council of June 23, 1711, for the special object of moderating the rise of the waters, and opposing to their sudeen irnuption an artificial obstacle in the place of the natural ones, wIhich had been imprudenUtly destroyed in the upper part of the river. The dykeof Pinaywell performed its purpose in the muonth of October last; it supported the wfaters to a height of 21m. 47c. above the ordinary level;* it thus checked and drove back into the plain of Eorez a ins, of w.-ater estilmatd at more than 100milions of cubic metresand the rise had attained its maximvmn height at Roannefour or five houars before this immense reservoir WaS completely filltd. If the dyke of Pinay had not existed, not only would the rise of the water have sooner reached Boanne, hut the volume of water would have increased by about 2.600 cubic nietresper second; the duration of the inundation would have been shorter, but the imagination is startled at the addition vwhich might have been made to the disaster, already so great, of which the valley of the Loire has been she theatre. Moreover, the rise of the water above the, dyke of Pinsy produced no injury; far from that, the plne of Eorez wvil formany pears feel the fecundating action of the mud which thewaterc'deposited in it. Such has been the part performed by this work which a wise foresight raised orour secur3ty,and to serve us as an example. Tlhere exist in the gorges from wbence the tributary streams of our rivers flow, a great number of points where the experience of Pinay may be economically renewed, if the localities be well selected, thns usefully checking the eowing of the watsrs, and in most cases affording a material advantage to agrLculture. In place of these completely open dykes, ithas been proposed to also construct locks vwith floodgates. The reservoirs thus formed would keep back the water in times of inundation, and would allow in dry seasons of its being devoted to the wants of agriculture.' "The edict of 1 sil, epoken of by L Collignon, clearly irdicates the part whil:h the dykes are called on to play. It contains the followving apassage:- "' It in indis4ensibly necessar to Make three dykes in tne interval of the bed of theriver where boats do not pass-the first, at the riles of Pinay; the second, at the Chateau de 1a Roche; ind the third at the piers of an old bridge built on the Loire, near the village of St. Iaurice; and, with the assistance of thes dykes, the passages being narrowed, the water which woild otherwise pass in two days would scarcely be able to do so in four or five. The volume of water, being thus diminished by more than onebalf, will no longer cause subh ravages-as those which hare occurred during the last three years.' 'In fact, in1866as in1846,the dykes of PinayandLa Roche saved Roanne from a complete disaster. It may be moreover remaiked, tbat according toM. Boulang4, exengmeer-in-chief of the department of the Loire, the dyke of Pinay onlycost 170,OOOf., and that of ILaRoche 40,000f., and-he only estimates tke expenseat 3,400,000f. for building Â£-ve additional large dykes and 24 weirs, whichheproposes o have constructed on 'the tributary streams of 'theILie. .

It will not be very experAive if the small weirs be multiplied, instead of very large onesibeing erected - but it is clear that tlhs will lot prerent the necessity of secondnar works for the protection'of the towns and certain mote expoe,i "I wish you, therefore, to have this system examined oni the spot, as soon as 'ble, by the competent men of your' ministry. I wish that, independently of the dykes which are to be erected on the most threbtened points there shoald be mane at Lyons a- channel for carrymg off the geathulk of water, similar to that at Blois- it would have the advantage of preserving the city, and increasing the defence of that fortified place. Iwish'that-there should be Amade in the -bed of the Loire, at a time when the water is lowr, and parallel to the course of the river, dykes formed of branches 'of trees open at the upper jart, in ordei to form baKns for the mud, as progsed by,L Fortin, engineer of. thePontset Chawsies. These-dykea woulcd have the advantage of stopping the sandWitthout checking thewater, and thus deepening thebed of the river. $I wishthat the system proposed for'the Rhoneb IM. Vadide, Tnspector-general des Ponts et 1han1sees, sho..9d be seriously examined, with the concurrence of the Swiss Government. It consists in lowering the waters of the Rhone at the place where it rus from the lae of Geneva, and of constructing a weir there. By this means there would be obtained, according to his account, a lowering of the waters of the Leman, which would be. useful to the Valais, the Canton de Vaud, and Savoy; and also-a better navigation of thb lake, embellishtefits for Geneva, less disastrousr inundations in the valloy of the Rhone, and a better navigation of that river. "Lastly, I wish that, as already exists for some, the management of the great rivers should be confided to one person, in or-der thlit the, direction may lie unique and pr6mptin themoment of danger. I wish that the engineers eho hav.cq long experience in mnatters connected with rivers .should be advanced on the s-pot, and iot suddenly taken fromn their particular works, for it freieantly hyappens that an engineer who has devoted a part of his life either to tho study of maritime works on the seacoast or to hydraulic vworks in the interior is suddenly, by being prorhotpd, employed on another service, and the State loses the advantage of his special knovledge and the result ef his long :practial experience. "What happefied after the great inundation of 1846 shouild serve as 'a lesson for us. Much was said on the subject in the Chambers, and very luminous reports were made ; -but no system was adopted, no clearly defned impulse given. Partial works only were executed, which, according to the opmion of scientificmen, only tended, M I consequence of their want of ensemble, to render the effects of the last scourge more disastrous. * I pray God, Monsieur le Ministre, to have you in His holy keeping. " Plombieres, July 19." " NAPOLEON. Commercial transactions are at a dead calm in Paris. The wealthy part of the population has removed to the country, and retailers are doing little or no business. In the first days of the mnonth maniufacturers sold pretty largely for the fair of Beaucaire, but those purchases have now nearly ceased. Letters from the south state that the fairs opened on the 15th under the most favourable auspices. Business immediately commenced, and considerable sales weoe effected. Raw silk and silk atufis were in particular demand, and fetched high prices. The accounts from the manufacturinadistricts are likewise satisfactory. Numerous commission ag,ents had reappeared at Ronent, Mulhouse, Amiens, and Roubaix, and made extensivepurchases. At Lyons andSt. Etienne al hands were at work, and the stock was completely exhausted. The harvest has commenced in various parts of France, and an opinion as to the produce may soon be formed. In the south it has been indiferent, and only middling in the centre, but in the Beauce, Brie, and other districts, from which Paris is supplied, in the east, west, but particularly in the north, the crops present the most magnificent appearance, and, up to this time, everything augura harvest superior to that of an average year. Prices accordingly maintain themselves with dlifficulty. There is no change in the cattle markets. The prospects of the vintage are reassuring. The oiditum has not shown itself in Buugundy, Chani- pagne, or along the banks of the Cher and Loire,j and it has nade but little progress in Langue- i doe and other parts of 1he south. The bunches of grapes ale genera.Uy abunidant, an-d there is every reason to believe that the produce will be that of an 4 ordinary year. Prices, nevertheless, have not doe- clined.

This Govemment is at great pains to keep the world in ignorance of what is doing on the Neapolitan and Roman questions, but the following information relative to the former may be relied upon. About a wreek since Prince Petrullla, the' Neapolitan Minister at this Court, informed Count' Biiol that his Government did not consider the pre- sent a fittingy moment for those adm3inistrative and: judicial l eforms which the Imperial Cabinet seemed to consider necessary for the pacification of lNaples and Itsiy. The NYeapolitan diplomatist, whlo spoke in the name of Don Luigi Caraffa, the BMnister for Fo-'. reign Affairs, complained of the behaviour of Englaind ankd France, and even hinted that the latter had' some knowledge of the agitation wlhich was going on3 in favour of the family of SMurat. In short, the ~Neapolitan Governmnent politely refused to listen' to the advice of Austria. A day or two after the abovementioned interview (probably on the 13th)' Count 3Buol forvrarded another note to the Neapolitan Govermnment, in which the necessity for some kind of concession to the Western Powers was again urged. -If information acquired at a respectable' source be correct, it has been suggested thatit -would harIdly fail to produce a favounrableimpression in the West if an amnesty w.ere granted,:w and Prince Satriano made Minister of the Interior; but the King of Naples bears such a high character' for obst-inacy, that no one here believes he 'wll! voluhtetrily consent to do anything that is required o f him. General Filangieri hais recently inspected the Caliabrian eoast, and it is said that it is 'to bs strongly fortified. Officers of Engineers are actively, employed on the frontiers of Rome and Naples, aidfortificatiols are now being constructed at a towr called Sora, which is in the mnountains betweetiAbrtxzzo and the Terra di Lavoro.

BERLIN, Jury 20. ror another fortnight, until the King and Queen return hither, this placei must remain the desert that it is-desert in every respect, except that houses and trees are to be found here reposing list]essly on the sandy plain of the Mark of Brandenburg. It will not be till about the 3d or 4th of next montlh that the King and Queen will return to Potsdam. All the accounts that reach us from M4arienbad, where the King is staying, and Tdplitz, where the Queen is, unite in describing the advantaae as very great which the Roval couple are dersving from the waters. The king more particularly, who is perfectly in his element in the easy Uilafected style of life that prevails at the less frequented bathls, more particularly of Bohemia, seems to be making numerous conquests of the hearts of those who come wvithin the range of his personal influence. Freedom from the cares of Government and romn the constanatly pressingnecessity of keeping the different parties and tendencies at the Court in undisturbed! equilibriun, which is the ruling principle of His Majesty's ideas of kingcraft, leaves the extreme kindliness of his disposition and his great intellectual treasures full leisure for development, while the absence of Court ceremonial leaves him a wlidlar scope for this exhibition than the formalities that surround a kinii in his own dominions will admit of. Almostinhmediately after the ieturn of tbe KingandQueen the Empress Mlother of Russia willreturn to. Pots-lan from Wildbad, and after a rest there of a fewv days will proceed on her journcy back to St. Petersburg. It may be expected that on this occaion she will return by sea, for the voyage would certainly be infinitely less trying to any one in delicate health than travelling over the most wretchedly bad roads. The iEmpress Mother will be accompanied on her return, not by the Prince of Prussia, as was at first proposed, but by his SOnI, Frine Friedrich Wilhelm. the brsidegroom elect of t'ne PrincessRoyal, and he will proceed subsequently to Mosecow,x and represent the Royal family of Prus.ia at the Imperial coronation. The 1'rince and Princess of Prussia, with their daughter the Princess Louise, will spend a few weeks at Ostend. on leaving England, so that they will hardly return here before the end of August; the marriage of the young Princess is fixed to take plaoe on the 20th of the following month. According to very recent adivices from St. Peters- burg, the E3mperor will not leave that capital until he proceeds to MIoscow to be crowned; the reigning Empress-has already returned there, after havingi accompanied her children on a journey round the CO.lSt of the Gulf of Finland.| The Mlinister President, Baron von Mlanteuffel rettuxned last Friday from his sea bathing ex, cursion to Schevening, but after- a day's pause here proceeded to his estate in Lower Lusatia.

I could not, however, resist my desire to show how. many claimns on the attention of the devout has that chlrch 'which Ei MIajesty of Naple came from Gaeta to visit. A very different fact, and one perhaps of not much less importance, is the extensire circulation throughout the -capital and the provinces of a proclamation frowm the Liberal party. it is addressed to " the Neapolitwts," and runs thus "Your craol, painful, and protracted sufferings have been supported with so. much dignity as to have awakened the compassion of tIhe diplomacy of Europe. Yet, comprativny spealing, it Imows and can know but an infrinitely sntll portion of what you suffer. - Now that a propitioas breeze begins to inspire us with the hope that the-tr;inph of justice and equity is not fvr distant; now that by -isible signs, by the dishonour of the people confided to them, the hand of God weighs heavily on perjured Admistrationg, we turn to you with that serenity of mind which has never deserted us amid the vicissitudes of fortune, or amidatae rule of passtons hosie to the most holy principles. The time, perhaps, is not far distant when this your country will become the theatre of new events; await them with that same dignified and noble calmness, of which up to the present momient you have given so many splendid proofs. Whenyour position shall be changed, show youmselves to be not like slaves who have broken their chxins, but free men iho feelallthevalneof theirliberty, who have aconsciousness 6f their rights, who desire the reign of legality and justice, snd do not madlv riot in the regions of Utopia; and amid vain -delusions do not conceal from yourselves one even of your past errors, and in not concealing them you 'will give the suarest pledge tht they will not be reneweed. Be united in the one desire for a constitut-ional legality and for an admi7 nistration which will ranintain it intact and inviolate. RespecA the rights ofall. e not umjust towards those who have preserved their devotion amid the duties of military discipline, who no less thau you have execrated umiversal injustice, and who for so many reasons deserve your affection and esteem. The bohour of our commLon country is specially confided to their hands, and under a juster and more enlighteried Government they, the rivals of their compauions in arms in Piedmont, who have gained for the Italian cause the sympatbies of Europe, will notehrink froml preserving it uncontaminated against theambition of foreign arms. Concord andtranquillity-these we shall never cease to recommendto you; and leave to youlrenemies the remorse of having trampled on the work of God, and that vindic tive fury vhich is the surest indication of their own weakness. Thus only can we assert that God 'will be with us znd hope for the triumph of a cause which is undoubtedly the most holy and the mnost just." The first thing which strikes us7 on reading this proclamaition is the temperate spirit in which it is written. Then we perceive that the end and object of the project or wish is the constitution bymnoral means, ifpossible. This itis whichis felt to be the only gugarantee of liberty; all else, without it, is of no value; and this, urdess it be guaranteed by foreign Governments, is not to be accepted. The address of MIanin appears to be reproduced in this one of the Neapolitans, and it augurs well for the fortunes of the Liberal cause that its advocates are more disposed. to trust to the efficiency of means of which all good and prudenlt men can approve. A few days since the inauguration of the portion of the Naples and Palermo Electric Telegraph line which extends to Eboli took place. It is expected that the entire line will be completed in six months. The nrincipal stations will be at Naples, Eboli, Cosenza, Reggio, Mlessina, and Palernio. Signor Pellegrno is the acting engineer. Another line, too, has been completed from Naples to Castellamare, with a branch to "Quli si Sana," the lRoyal residence. -It is to be opened to the public as soon as the usual religious observances sball have leen performed. The superior and directing engineer of electric telegraphs is 3I. G. de Ronnani. I have on several occasions alluded to the differential duties, which pressed so heavily and so unjustly on British commerce. I am glad now to report that they have just been removed. An application on the question was made to Sir WTilliam Temple on the 21st of last month, whiich has been made the subject of a coinmuuication to Signor Caraffa, Miaister for Foreign Affairs, on the 20th uLt. An answer was returned on the 12th inst., not only granting the request, but promising to refmnd the entire duties which had been paid under protest. WVho will get them-the British owners of vessels, or the foreign merchants, who chartered them ? Another question has arisen as to the boon granted by this Government. We might have had it two years ago for the nsking. It could not and would not-have been refused. SPAR\'. Our accounts from Madrid are of the 17th inst. The disarmament of the National Guard was proceeding actively, upwards of 15,000 muskets having been already surrendered. General Espartero 'was said to have retired to the English Embassy. MM.L Patricio, Escosum> Pasoaal Mados, Sagnsta, Calvo Asencio, and other depouties, wthoheaded the battalions of the N=ational Guard during their resistance, had absconded. GeneralsZabala, Serrano, Bedoya, Iriare, Ametler, validez, and several others, who were then at MIadrid, had not offered their services to the Queen, 'but it, 'does not appear that they toolk part with the insurgents. LGeneral Serrano Dominguez had been appointed Captain-General of Madrid, and General Mianuel de la Concha Governor of the Palace.

A portion of the garrison of .Madrid' and 'the troops concentrated at Vittoria had been placed at his disposal, in order to reduce garagossa to sunbmisson.

"Madrid, July 14." The following are the terns in which the Civil Governor of Madrid announces that order is restored - "Iuhabitants of Afadrid,-In annoumciag to you that order is re-established my.duty is to address to you a wrtrd of assurance and confidence. All wvell-meaning and pWaC - able persons, without distinction of parties, will seer ivi h the msot complete protection from the Governtment.

Assurance to this effect is given yon in the name of the Qaeen's Government by your Civil Governor, -n "MANUEL ALONZO MARTDNEZ." The Government, after the re-establishment of order, had the follow-ing notice placarded over Madrid- " The rebellion is overeome and terminated, and the Iempire of the law is re-established. Te deputation and te municipality of Madrid have been dissolved by order of thes military authority. The National Geard of the capital his also been dissolved and subjected to re-organization, wvith the exception of the tvo brave companies of that force who have remained faithful to their oath, to their Queen, and to their conntry. At this moment (16sh July, 7 o'clock in the morning) the disarmament of the Nlational Guard is in progress. The facticus muinority of tue Deputies who, the day before yesterday, held an illegal deliberation in the Palace of the Cortes, and -who, in thel morning, of yesterday, also held a sitting ater h3ving received the declaration made by the Government on the usurpation and the violence of its conduct, resolved todissolve. The internal communications of the capital hava teen re-established." The following is the text of the proclamation published at Saranossa "aInhabitants of tre Province of Saragossa,-An attemptfdisastrous to the caasa of liberty, has just been-perpotrated in the capital of the kingdom. The man wvho in 1S51 dr-tw his sword in the name of the law has now seized up.n thev government of the nation in defiance of that same law.

" The city of Siragossa, always heroic and the firmeest: rampart of liberty, could not remnai an indifferent spec- tator of so -nefarious an attempt.

It alo strengthens the impression that the Ruk have-not made arrangements to purchase gold at a losS to the extent that was reported, but will endiaviour to fortify their position by more legitimate means. About 10,000!. of gold to-day was purchased on account of the French Criedit Mlobilier, towards Trq6iding for their speculatins in Spain, Austria, and elzewhere. A further portion also-was taken for the Bank of France, and only a very small amount was sold to the Bank of-England. - - The suspension was annouminid this mnorning, of the Hertford and Ware Bank. It was conducted by Messrs. Samuel Adams and-Co., and kr. Adams is also largely in business as a mnaltUter. The Bank was established 43 years ago, and was entitled, under the act of 1844, to issue notes to the amount of 22,6351.; but, according to the latest returns, the total in circulation is only 13,1231. Nothing has transpired with regard to the prospects of liquidation. Advices from Naples state that SirWilliam Temple had just communicated to the merchants the receipt of a note from the Minister of Foreign Affaira assuring him of " the desire of His Sicilian Majesty to meet England's wishes at all times, and that Englishl vessels shall enjoy the same privileges as Neapolitan, and those of other nations who have reciprocal treaties; also that the 10 per cent. extra duty paid ork,<vheat by English flag to France shaRl be returned if paid under protest." Xeapolit-an vessels have the same privileges in this country as English, not only with regard to indirect, but aLso intercolonial and coasting trade. It is therefore hoped that a treaty of perfect reciprocity will very soon be concluded. - The mania for establishing Cr6dit Mlobiliers in Gemmany shows no signs of subsiding. To those of Vienna, }rankfort,, Darmstadt, Leipsic, Dessau, and others, of which the shares are at premiums ranging from 10 to 90 per cent., there are now twvo additions which have just been introduced at Berlin. The! first consists of several second-rate merchants and bankers. The other, which is designated the Society of Commercial Credit, counts among its adnminstrators some of the first mercantile names in Berlin. The capital is fixed at 15,00 000 thalers (or 2,250,0001.), of which the directors ta-e 7,500,000 thalers at par, while the remainder are to be sold at a premnium, which is to be carried to the credit of the company. UJpon a subscript-ion being opened for a portion of the amount at l0 premium applications were sent in to the extent of 140,000,000 thalers. The eagerness to obtain shares is attributable to the fact of the company having at its head commercial men -who have alwvays been known to be successfuL The - managers reserve to themselves 5 per cent. out of theprofits, and the directors are to have 6 per cent. before any distribution whatever is made to the sharehoIders. The shares are of 200 thalers each, and are already in great demand at 17 per cent. premium. The bar silver brought by the last West India packet has been sold to-day at 614d. per ounce being the same price as that for the previous arrival. The commercial advices from NewYork to-day confirm the anticipations of arise in the stockmarket consequent upon the settlement of the Crampton difficulty. Several descriptions had experienced an advance of 2 or 3 per cent. Erie was quoted 634; Reading, 93; Panama, 101; and Illinois Central Bonds, 91. The rate of exchange was still firm, and shipments of gold to this country are likely to be made on their present scale up to next month. The decision of the New York Court of Agppeals with regard to the non-Liability of the New Haven Railway on the stock fraudulently issued by Mr. Robert Schuyler, their president, continued to excite much attention. The case is one that should operate as a warning to purchasers of American securities on this side. The stock certificates in question were issued to the extent of 400,00i1. They were in the usual form, signed by the regular officers of the company, and had nothing about them to excite suspicion. On the companyrefusing to recognizetheman actionwas brought in the ordinary court, and a verdict given that, the fraudulent issue having been made by their proper officer, the company must respond in damages for the delinquency of their agent, such damages being fixed at the market value of the stock at the time when the certificates were taken. This decision has now been reversed in the Court of Appeals, on the extraordinary ground that the company having already issued their legal amount of capital could not legalize the over-issue, and consequently that, the certificates being void under all circumstances, no one could claim damages for a refusal to recognize them. TInder these circumstances the parties interested intend to carry the case before the Supreme Court at Washington, but meanwhile every possessor of American certificates must bear in mind that, even although these documnents may carry the signature of every duly. appointed officer engaged in the undertaking, they constitite no valid security in case those officers should designedly or involuntarily have lent themselves to any fraud. Caution should also be excited by - the circumstance that a leading company can be found with the concurrence of its shareholders wilng, to take advantage of such a plea. Look-ing at the character of the entire transaction, it is satisfactor to contemplate the fact that when a similar stat7o of affairs occurred in the Royal Swedish Railway, throuagh the misdeeds of Sadleir, not a single shareholder was found to offer a proposition to evade responsibility by this means. The Committee of Spanish-American Bondholdera have transmitted the copy of a document, too longe for insertion, adlressed by their agent at Bog,ta ihe Govrnment of NTew Granada. Its object is to demand the strict fulfilment of the agreement of the 15th of January, 1845, assigning to the creditors of the Republic the tobacco duty and half the Customs. ~. correspondent suggests that, as the merchants connected with the Cape of G ood Hope are anxiolls to write by the steamers shortly about to leave with troops, some special intimation from the Post-office cf the period when they are likely to atart w6uld be serviceable.

STATE OF TRADE, MANCHESTER, JULY 22. There has not been much business; tse accoumts from India, which were expected to improve the market, hlwving created disappointment. Manufacturers and spinners have still employment on unfinished orders, anid are not pressing for new business, consequently they maintain a firm attitude towards buyers, and there is no change in prices. 'The market is not so inactive, however, as at the close of last week, and, asregards the home trade, a rnore cheerful feel ing prevaiis in the anticipaMon of a better cf trade. Bol.h in cloth ard yarn prices are steady. Mlessrs. John Slagr and Co. report of the cloth market: -"We have had a qniet het steady market throughout the week, without change in prices. TAo-day there h.s bee~ a imore cheerful feeling and an improved demand, and a fair amoiunt of business has been done at very ifull rates." Messrs. G. Fr'aser, Son, and Co.,* say of the marketi generally" There is but little or no alteration to notice in tc-day's market; prices are without change, and1themarket vithout nuch animation." LEEDS, J~uLy. 22. The cloth trade is rather qtel just noir, and bsiness is scarcely so brisk as it vw as a week or two ago.. This apparent relapsing seems to be grincip^aly occaitoned by the somewhat unsettled state of the wool trnale. The price of mool having receded at.the late wool sales, the merchants are unwillig to purchase goods at the prices demae aed by the manufacturers, and conseqiuently business is checked. F A son, owecr,as things assme a mere settled is et, the cdoubt that there will be E good demand for woollen cloths. In 'he cloth-halls this mLorning a qo,ieter tone prevailed than on Saturday, and tlere was -little disposition to operate; consequently, transactioeis were only tlo alimited extent, and chiefly comprised fweeds and other l ight fabrics The report of this day's Huddersfield market is as follos-_ The price of wools having been to a certain extent settled at the recent sales, those parties who held back- in expectation of a large Yeduction in price and consequ:ent fall in cloth, have visited the market to-day, and trade is brisker. Shipping houses have bought low goods, other houses plain goods,"

In this cage a person named Hannah Knight, who was the aceounting defendant in a suit at the Bolls of " Brotherton v. Knight," had been ordered to py a sum of 700L, which falling to do a sequestration had issued against her estate; and she was at present conesaled. Under these circumstances a petition was presented, asking payment of that sum to the sequestratoie appointed in the other suit, out of moneys to which Hannah Knight was entitled in this sui;, or in the alternative that a transfer of the fand in this suit; might bh made into the other suit. Mr. IOtnxiV (for Mr. Boys) appeared in support of the petition. 31r. G. W. CoLrL1'S opposed it. The VIcE-CsHA-cRLLos said he had looked into the cases witthout being able to fnd any precedent in point; but there was a case of "W ilson v. Ietcalfe," 1 Beavan, wher3 Lord Las gdaie had ordered payment by a stranger, who did not dispute the right of the party to the money; therefore by analogy this Court stood in the place of that stranger, nd not only did not dispute the right to the mnney, but had made an order recogni2ing the right to it; and, therefore, as nieither this Court nor the Rolls' Court had juaridiction to orde axny transfer from one suit to the other, a petition must be presented either to the Lords Justice s or the Lord Chancellor entitled in both suits; and his lonour wotld meantime make an order for an injunction to re' strain Hannah Knight from dealing with this money whi^-h the superior Court miight either support or discharge, according as they dealt with the casa.

Tlhe statement was supplied by a corresp)ondent on whore ;vord he had been. in the hab}t of ringD, and before hi land 5any opporunity of making inquiry the plca of justHication was placed upon the reoord. Since then, howrever; he had instituted the necessary inquiries, and the result was that he was now perfectly satisfied that there was not t3e'least foundation for the insinuation against the character of the Marquis, anclhe -was therefore intrusted k -.,t1drav the plea of justification, and to apologise en the part of the defendant for inserting the article in -question, and-he ^would consent to a 'verdict that would carry wsots.

SMIH This ws an action to recover damages for aLn illegal dlistress. 3Ir. Bovili, Q. C., and 3Mr. C. Po'lloclk were for the plain. tiff; and Mr. G. Demnran and Mfr. Cbitty for the defendant. -The ulainti;ff, it appeared, was a 'widow, who had for- merl occpieda respectable position in lifis, balt at the death of her husband she was left v.ith har-dly any resources, and 'with a family cf si; children dependent upon her. The defendant was a sheriffs officer, brok-er, and anctioneer, and the action wa&s brought against him to recover damages f or his having illegally seized and sold a quantity of furniture belonging to the plaintif. It appeared that Mr.Boweer, upon the death of h,er husband, endeavouredto obtain aLivelihood by k;eepin a lodgiughonse, and she occupied a*house on Albert-terr.ace, Gravesend, which she used for t.hat purpose; and it seemned' that at Christmas, 1855, she was in arrear for rent to the amount of 25C. Finding herself in this difficulty, it appeared that she proceeded to Lonldon in order-to - endeavour to obtein some assistance from her friends; and on her departure from (Iravesend she locked'no her house aud tbefurmiturecontaanedinit. Yery soon aftihehad leftituappes red t,hat the defendant and another man, named Stedman obtained admission to the house by placing a ladder against one of thewindows, and so gettingim; sandltedmanflra made a seizure for 57. for Queens taxes, and the defendat then made another for the arrears *of rent, and placards announcing the sale wvere icomodiately issued, and on thoe four-th day af'.er the seizure, the laworequliring that five days should first ho allowed to intervene, the furniture was sold, and, according tothe case for the prosecution, this wvas done in a most reckless mau,sner, many articles that had cost a considerable sum being sold for a mere trifle; and ..t arpeared that property which 'sas represented to be fairly' worth S61. was sold for 39l. ITo distress wTarrant 'was put ,n evidence, aLnd ther-e appeared pretty good ground for supposing that the defendant had. acted. principally, upon his owvn authority, and that he and Stedman had preconcerted the plan to obtain admission to the premises, thatSi tedmuan should make the seizure ftor Qneen'w taxes, and that 'when the door wa[;s opened the defendat. should go in and seice for theo rent. An attenmpt was made on the part of the defendant to show that Stedan wras the person who hadl commsitted the. trespass, but the facts f'ailed enltirely to justify tBhe assuption. The Lolsn Cnr Benole expressed his ou,nnion that the conduct of the defendat 'was altogether illea a] End wTithout. excuse, and he said the only question was the amount of damagSes to which the plaintiff wvas entitled. The jury retcued a verdict fo_ the plaintiff-Dainages,s 1501.

MATLDANTD CMRCMT. NOTTINTGEA1, JULY 21. tBejore Mr. Justice sJRESSWELL ald a Cormmon .ury.) LACEY V. COOKE. This was an action of trespass for seizing the plaintiff's farming stock and implements, as well as his household furniture and effects, and advertising the same for sale, vwhereby he was prevented from carrying on his business, bin crops were damnaged, and his credit imnpaired. Mr. Melor, Q.C., and Mr. Cockle were counsel for the yliaitiff; Mr. Serjeant Hayes and Mr. Boden for the de- The plaintiff is a farmer, occupying land near East Retford, in this county, and the defendant is one of the trustees under his marriage settlement. It appeared that in 1848 he married a widow named of Hal, who waspossessed of certain farming stack, which was valued at 4001., and a sum of 2001. secured by two promissory notes. Mrs. Hal bad two children by her former husband, who were entitled to some property under the wil of her father, and upon her marriage with the plaintiff her own property was settled to her own separate use for life, and afierwards to the mse of her children by both marriages. The trustees originally appointed had alowed the plaintiff to have the use of the farming stock, but declined to let him have the 2001. ; and then a change of trustees took' place, and the defendant and another person were appointed. They allowed the plaintiff to take the whole of his wife's reparate property, upon the understanding that he was to pay interest upon the 6001., and they afterwards took from him a mortgage security upon his farming stock, implements, household farniture, and efects. By that mortgage the trustees were empowered toI dlemand payment of principal and interest at any time, and! n case of non-payment forthwith, to enter and seize the property thereby assigned and sel the same. Assuming to act under the power thereby given, the defendant, on the Jth of October last, sent an auctioneer and bailiffs with a written notice, demanding immediate payment of the 6001. and interest, and with instructions to take possession in case of non-payment. Those instructions were carried out, and advertisements of a sale posted about the neighbourhood. The plaintiff at once consalted his attorney, and upon application to a learned judge in London an injunction was issued to stop the rale. After keeping possession for five days, the defendant wita.drew, but m the meantime the plaintiff stated that he had been stopped from carrying his crops of beans and tares, which were damaged by rain ; and his credit had been injured, as he alleged. by the appearance of the placards. The defendant's co-trusiee had not given any authority ior these proceedings against the plaintiff, and the defendant therefore could not just.fy his conduct under the power contained in the bil of sale; hut he eaUed witnesses for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff had sustained no substantial damage, and that he (the defendant) had only done what he thoug,ht necessary for the purpose of protecting the treast estate- The defendant had paid 40s. into court, but' in the end the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 201. The whole business of these assizes was concluded in one day.
OX-FORD CIRCUIT. _ STAFFORD, TUEsDiY, JULY 22. Lae crves cunness assizes was ronglit to an unexpected close this day, before S o'clock. It was at one time expected that ft would last throughout the whole of to-morrow (Wednesday), which is commission day at Shrewsbury; and gloomy expressions began to he uttered by the learned andges as to how it would he possible to get throuh the wvork. But we have often observed that nothing tends more to expedite business at the assixs than the near aniproach of comofsio-day in the next town. A deighful smurt of conciliation then seemns to take possession of everybody, from the highest to the lowest, and under this genial infuence we believe it w;AS that the civil business of the asaizeahad ailmelted down before 3 'clock this day. "Nonst," "referenceU," "withdrawng the record" (the three cardinal virtues of agisi P-is) 2 ll attended, and lent their id-eand thus it has come to pass that, beyond asl hopte the learned judges and the bar will he enabled to enjoy a " whole holyday." We need not say that this will be no unwelcome wind-up to a week of about 10 hours' daily work in the heat and foul air of the Stafford courts. CRmrsAL COURT.-(BefOre ilk. Justice WIGnn; sus.) oilliam Tuckley, aged 21, e.ngineer, and Henry Smith, agedl19,engineer, were charged with the manslaulghter of wdmund Hiarris, on the 28th of April last, at Bilaston. Mr. 3. Cook Evans and Mr. S. Hill appeared for the prosecution; and fr. Kenealy for the prisoners. Thepresentinquiry arose outof the explosion of a steam boiler, which took place at Msessrs. Rose and Higgins's iron works, at Ejlston, on the 28th of A pril last, when aS many as four men were killed. The engine-house WaS blown to pieces, and the boiler, which WaS strongly secured by brickwork, was torn from its seat and thrown several yards into he works. At the monment of the explosion the wholedlace ivaS filled with steam, but as soon as it bad cleared off the four men were found and attended to, but they were pl either kilted on the spot, or died soon after of the injswita teceived, In order to show the gIt of the prisoners it WaS proved that on the day n queston, Tuckley, the elder prisoner, had charge of the boiler up to 6 o'clock; and that after that time it was under the care of the younger prisoner. The explosion took place at a-cuarter to?7, and the evidence for the prosecution tended to shoxw that the accident arose from the neglgence af the prisoners to keep the boiler pronerly supplied with water. A man named Plant gave it UD at .4 o'clock to Tnckley, and at that tune it contained' water to the aepth of 3 feet 9 inches. At 6 o'clock Tuckley gave it up to the other prisoner, Smith, and accordmng to st,atements made by both the prisoners before the coroner, wvhich were nut in evidence, at 6 o'clock the boiler contained 3;feet 6 inc ies of water, R3ut several witnesses were examined, who stated when- they examinied the fire-plate the next day, it haa the appearance of having been subjected to a red hleat, which would weaken the plate and rivets, and render the tursting of the boiler probable. It appeared that about six months before tho a6cident the boiler was in .a lealqy etate, but *kaA thoroughljy repaired.. It: a ppeare -th!A - the boEter had a float' or. "gboy," to indicate the heizht ivt which the water stood, and it formerly had a whistle which performed the same office; but the latte&inArturent wna out of'ordt-and'did not &ct.;. ;At the close of thie case for the prosecution, Mr.. EVANS i answer to an appei, from the Court, sd he thught there was no -case against Tuckley. - Mr. = ALY then addressed the jury for the other pr;. soner (Smith); and the jury found him Ao' Gidklty Ifr..JustIce WIGHTMA?. said lhe thought the case was a' very propetr one for an inquiry, but he entirely approved -The piisonerseaere then both discharged. The onlvother case remaining, which was an indictment for a nuisance, was arranged; and this brought the businets of the assizes to an unerpectedly early termination at a lit'.le before 4 p.mn..
WESTERP. CIRCUIT. DORCHESTE JULY 21. . 11RDER. - CROwiV COURT.-(Befare Mir. &-jeant CHAstNmEL). Elizabeth Martha Brow.n was indicted for the wilfl murder of John Anthony Brown, her husband, at Broadwindsor, on the 6th of July. Mr. Stock and MIr. Compton were counsel for the pro-ecoution; and Mr. Edwards defended the prisoner. It appeared. that the prisoner and the deceased were formerly fellow-servants 'on a farm. An int;macy sprang up between them, and, although he wEs only 19 and the prisoner 40, they were marred about five yers ago. The deceased then became a carrier, and was, in consequence, frequently from home, and there wss reason to believe that the prisoner was jealous of her hua. band. On the 5th of July the deceased went with his horse and cart with another man, also with a horse and cart, to Beaaminster, a distance of about seven miles. On the road they saw HLazr Davis, the 'woman of whomthe prisoner was jealous, and she walked some short wav with them. They left Beaminster on their return home about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but called at a publichouse on their road, 'where they remained drinking and playing at skittles until midnight; they then left the publchouse and proceeded onward tintil they came to a divisioa of the road, 'where tho deceased and his iriend parted, each going towards his own brome. About 2 o'clock in the morning a wom in named Xight, who lived close to the gate of the field in whicb the deceased kept his horse, heard fo,otsteps, which sho believed to be those of the deceased, going past her house. She had previously heard the gate of the field slam, and a noise as of a horse eating the grass. A hIrs. Frampton, who lived some distance off, heard screams hetween 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, proceeding in a direction from Brown's house. Al was then quiet until. S o'clockiu themorning, when the prisoner called up a person named Damon, who lived some 130 yards off. .e imnmediately getup and went to Brown's house and in an inner room he found Brown lying on the iloor on his right side, blood was flowing freely from his head, and his hair was covered with brains and blood. He was dead. The prisoner was standing by ; he asked Tier how it happened. She said she hai heard a noise outside the house, and she opened the door, and found her husband-he was bleeding very much. He said, " The horse." She carried him along the passago throngh the shop, and into this inner rcom. Damon asked her why she did not call him before. She said her husband had hold of her dress, and she could not get away from him until he, became weak and faint, and then she pushed him back, and he fell on the ground. Damon exaamined the body, but there was no blood on the bosom of his shirt. There was no blood in the passage or in the house, except in the room where the body was lying, There was no blood in the road leading from the field, nor were there anymuarks of any struggle. The field gate was 137 yards from the house. His hat was close to the gate as if it had been placed there, and did not appear as if it had falen off. A halterwas hanging on the rail of the gate. Other persons were then called up and went to the house. The de-^eased's head was tied up vwith a hankerchief. lThe following evidence is very important. Richard William Broter.-I am a surgeon at Beaminster and have been in practice seven or eight years. I and another gentleman named Gilbert were requested to make a pos0t eswrtem examination of Brown. We did so on the Wednesday, in his house. The body was in a coffin, and was dressed for interment. There was a wound over the right eyebrow, dividing the integument, but the bone was not fractured there; that commenced at the eye, and ran up. wards and outwards. The bones of the nose were broken. There was a small wound at the root of the nose, which had driven in the inner angle of the organ. There was a wound a little above the left eyebrow, triangular, through which the bone protruded. The integumeUtwas separatedifrom the bone, leaving the triangular bone protruding. At the side of the .left eye, a little behind, was a wound running uD and down about an inch in length. The open surface of the integmment was about a quarter of an inch. Passing backwards over the head, rasther at the top of the head, there was another triangular wound, through which the bone protruded. It was about an inch at its base. It was a little bent in on one side, coming up to an angle. Behind that was a wound passing from before, backwards, nottriangular. On the top of the head there was another three-cornered wound. Quite at the back of the head there was another wound that was divided into two. The left ear was perfor-ated, and behind it a long wound divided into two. It did not gape above a quarter ofanuinch, end itwas rather more than an inch long. We removed the integument from the skull, and found the frontal bone fractured on the left side, extendin g above the midd7e of the orbit upwards and backwardsl across the parietal bone, and extending into the occipita bone from an inch to an inch and a-half. The frontal bone was separated from the parietal about half an inch. I then removed seven pieces of bone that 'were driven in on the brain, varying in sizefromabout half au inch to three inches. I then removed the brain, and at the back of the head, at the lower part of the brain, there was a large quantity of blood that hadbeeneffused. Thneplexus of thebrainwasverymuch inflamed. The forefinger of the left hand was bruised, but whether it was old or new bruise I could not say. Either of the wounds I have described would cause death. The kind I have mentioned would. The small wound a1; the root of the nose, the one behind the triangular wound, or the one behind the ear would. Such wounds would have caused a great flow of blood. Presuming the deceased to have received the injuries in the field, he could not have gone home without a considerable flowing of blood over the face and over the front of his person. I presume he could not have gone that distance without; leaving traces of blood on the road. The wound in the nose would have bled freely. Supposing he wa assisted into the house by his -wife as she stated, I should think there would be marks of blood, unless her clothes caught it. If he had received the injuries in the field, my opinion is he could not have reached his home-he mnst have been totally paralyzed. That must necessarily and immediately have beon the effeet of the injuries. I beleve there are three wounds that would incapacitate him from going that uis. tance. All the wounds being there, a person would not have been able to speak afterwards. Under the three wounds the brain was so damaged that he could not have lived afterwards. I have been in court during the triaL The deceased could not have held the prisoner as stated two hours after receiving the wounds. He rould have been dead. By the JUDGE. -There might have been a death grip, but he must have had power previously to grasp her. Examination continued.-After receiving the wound he would not have power to grasp so. The wounds were not such as would bei occasioned by the kick of a horse; one of them might have been produced by the kick of a horse, but they were not at all like what would be caused by the kick of a horse ; they were such as might have been produced by a blunt instrument, such as the back side of a hat_hot: striking sideways with the back of a hatchet would produc6 a three-cornered wound-some such as he had desaribed. Cross-examined-I have never been present when a skull was fractured- I do not know that I have ever seen wounds caused by the kick of a horse or by the back of a hatchet; a fiat iron or a poker that had an angular edge would cause such wounds; I have seen about half-a-dozen fractures of the skull; have seen a patient breathe afterwards, hut not conscious ; sometimes when there baa been a fracture of the skull persons hays lived years afterwards- The wound behind the ear I should think would cause death. The piece of bone was driven into the brain, and deceased could not have walked after receiving that. There are two other wounds that would prevent him from walldng. iltness was also examined on some extraordinary instances of recovery after the bone of the head hadbeen severely factured. Re-examined.-T looked at the horse's shoes; one was in two pieces. I come to the conclusion that they 'would not produce the wounds-certainly not. By the JUDGE.--1 believe the man was dead immediately after receiving thei wounds. Joachim Gslbelt.-I live at Beaminster. I have been in practice 32 years. In company with the last wfvitness I made a Post morste examination of Brown. I have heard his account of the weands; I agree with him, and come to the same conclusions. Cross-examined-I know there have been remarkaMble instances of portions of the substance ofithe brain having been lost, and the. person recovering, but in this case it is moraJly impossible. The temporal bone was driven in half an inch. I know there are cases in which the bone had been driven in and the person afterwards recovered. By the JuDGE--When there is a pressure of bone on the brain anda portion of thebrain escapes, it sometimes affords relief. There was one of the wounds at the top of the head in which I put my finger at least an inch. It was imPossible for this and the others to exist without a tremendous shedding of blood. Mr. EDWARDS addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner, urging upro them that the death might have been caused by the cIr of the horse, or that some person might leave inflicted the blows, but that it was nmost improbable the wife should have done the mischief, as she depended on her husband for her living. Mr. Serjeant CnArEL having summed up, The jury retired at 6 o'clock. They were sent for at 10 o'clock, and they then said they wished to ask some questions of the medical man. , Mtr. Gilbert was sent for, and in answer lo questions put to him by the jery said that had the post smeodeme examrination taken p lace earlier the appeaances would have been the same, and. that it would have been periectly impossible for the man, after having been so dreadfully Wounded, to got into the inner room, even w;ith the eassihance of the 'wife.*- The jury upon this found the prisoner Guiily, and sentence of death was passed upon her, the JnDGZ stating that he concurred in the verdict. The court was crowded the whole day.

MIr. Freshfield, solicitor to the Bank of England, ap ared for the prosecution ; Mr. Wontner 'attended on behalf of the prisoner. Mr. Fxeshfield briefly opened the case on the part of the procecution, and called - !Mr. Henry Haley, who said,-l am a clerk in the New Three per'Cent.-office.ofthe Bank of England. I know the prisoner, from his hsving transacted business at our office I produce the transfer book of the New Three per Cent. Stock. On and prior to the 20th of May lsst the sam of 5081. ls. was stending in the books of the Governor and Company, of the Bank of England, in the name of E Bliziw Potts of Great Totham, Essex, spinster." On the 20th of May last atransfer was made of 500., part of the 50.. Is., by a woman who signed in my presence the name of Eliza Potts, and she was identified by the prisoner as the owner of the stock, and he signed the transfer book in my presence, identifying ^hat womaja as Ehlia Potts. The transfer was made in the usual manner, and into theelame of " Henry Smith, of the Stock-Exchange." I have since seen a person named Eliza Hrnmphreys, who stated that her maiden name was Eliza Potts, and that she is the rightful owner of that stock. Mrs. Eli7Humphreys, who seemed almost in a fainting state, said,- y name before I was manried was ElizaPotts. I am nowthe vwfe of Charles Humphreys, a gardener, and reside at M-istley, in Essex. In and prior to the year 1849 I bad some stock in the Bank of England, the arrangements connected with which up to that time had been conducted by Mr. Gower, who then died. Subsequently to that time I came up to town on several occasions and communicated with the prisoner, who purchased stock for me and attended with me at the Bank to receive my dividends. I remember in narticular coming to town on the 26th of October, 1854, just before my marrince. On that occasion I saw the prisoner at the Bank, and he accompanied me to receive my dividends. I then told him I was going to be married on the 30th, and Imiado a transfer of 3001., part of the stock, and gave him 1001. to invest. The transfer and investment were made for my sister, Mary Stow, of Nayland, Suffolk. I came up to town-again on the 4th of the present month. Iam quite cure that ldid not go to the Bank in the interval betweenOctober, 1854, and the present month, and that I did not make any transfer of any part of my stock, or receive any dividend, after I was married, which was on the 30th of October, 1854. I came up on the 4th of July inst., with my aunt and Mrs. Stow, and we went to the Bank to receive our dividends. Mrs. Stov. received her dividends without difficulty. When I applied for mine the clerk told me there was some mistake, and asked me where my broker was. I went for the prisoner, but could not findhim. Ileft word at his office that I was goingto the Bank. I then went to the Bank and wvaited till he came. 1 said to him, " rve come up to receive my dividends, and I find they can't make it right, there's some mistake; what's the mattere' He replied, " You can't receive it to-day, because the transfer is not made." I said, " lVhy can't I? my money was not to be transferred )" He replied, "You can't receiveoit to-day, because it is not transferred " and he added, " What money do you want?will 201. do ?' I said, " It is not money that I wantI want to have my business settled." He said I could not have it settled then. I asked him, "Wlhy 1" and he again replied, " Because it has not been transferred," and he went away. I aftrards we-nt to the office of the chief accountant, v,ho showed me a docxument purporting to be a transfer of my stock, but that document was not signed by me. I returned to Mfistley the same night, and shortly afterwards received the followig letter from the pri-- soner:- "4, Austinfriars, Old Broad-street, July .5. " erMadam,-I beg leave to informa you that after lenving yourself, Mr. Humybreys, and friends at the Bank the second time yesterday .i wgas engaged in looking into the matter, respecting w hich I fear there is some r istinke.

I was looking for you at the railway station last evening at 6 o'clock. 4I remain, dear Madam, yours respectfully, " Mrs. Eliza HImnphreys, 3Iistley, Essex." Mlr. Freshfeld.-I ought per-haps at this s,age of the Broceedings to stato that since this tune the prisoner has caused 5l. to be replaced in the name of Mrs. Humphreys to her account in the Bank of EDngland. Probably Mr. WYontuer will be satisfied with that statement in lieu of proof of it ? Mir. Wontner signified his assent, and added that he had no question to put to the wcitnesses in cress-examination. TlsleLonD M.yoR, after the usual caution, nasked the prisoner whether he wiished to say anything in anser to the charge. The Prisoner.-2No, my Lord; I leave my case in the hands of my solicitor. HIe was fully committed for trial on this charge. A fresh ease was then proceeded with against the prisoner, he being charged with having feloniously aided, abetted, counselled, and advised a woman of unknown name to forge and utter a transfer of 200l., Part of a sum of 4001. New Three per Cent. Consolidated B.ank Annities, the tsnnsfer purportin to be made by one Mary Stow, with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. MEr. Henry Hlsey, clerk in the New Three per Cent.- office of the Bank of England, said,-I have searched the Bank books, and find there was a sum of 4001. Xew Three per Cent snding in the booiis of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, in the name of Mary Stow, of Nayland, Snffolk, widow, on and prior to the 9th of June last. I Preduce a transfer, puraorting to be execuned by I her, of 2OOI., part of that stock bearing that date. The prisoner identified the person transferring that stock on that occasion, uder the signature of "James ERailten." HIe signed the book as attesting to the identity of Mary Stow. Cross-examined by Mlr. Wontner.-I have known the prisoner 12 or 14 years. Mrs. Mary Stow.-I am a widow, residing at Nayland, in Suffolk. I had the sum of 400r. in the New Three per Cent Stock in Juno last. On the 4th of July inst. I went with my sister, Mrs. Humphreys, to receive my dividend. I had never been in the Bank of England before. I received my dividend. I was subsequently taken to anotaer office in the Bank of England, and was shown a document purporting to be a transfer of 2001., part of that stock. I did not sake the transfer, nor did I ever give authority to anybody else to make it. I never saw the prisoner before that day. I was not in thePan of En gland on the 9th of June last, the day on which the transfer purpoorts to be made. The prisoner declined saying anything in answer to the charge, and was fully committed for trialin this case also. James Hunter, a determined-looking fellow, was charged with beingconcerned witha man, sincctried and transported in steig a large quantity of jewelry from the shop of Mr. Cockayne, of Meark-lane, on the 15th nit. It will be ecollected that on the day n question two men entered the shop of Mr. Cockayne, and asked to be shown some shirt studs, but before there was time to serve them they decamped with a quantity of valuable articles. Theprisonermanagedto escape, but his companion, after a desperate resistance, was secured, brought to this court, commatted for trial, and subsequently transported. C. Bassett, constable No. o93, said.-Ahout 1 o'clock yesterday I was in Brick-lane. Spitallields, when I saw the Prisoner and three other men standing at the door of a.publichousa. I ght assistance and returned to the bar of the house, nd sav the prisoner, to whom r esid, "mHarry, we have been looking for you for a long time. I sUPPose you know us." He replied he did not. I staid to him "o am an officer I charge you w ith being concerned w ith another man, who has been since convicted, in assaultin and robbing or. Cockayne, jeweller, of Miark-lane." He replied "So help me -1I know nothing about it." I told him it occurred about a montheor five week;s ego. On being told at the tationhouse thedate of therobbery he said, "1 wish to God it had been a day before, and then I could have proved I was in other comnany." I was about to search thie prisoner, when he pulled offhis hat and took out has handkErchief, which hadesomething init. Iheldout my hand to take hold of it, when he said "It's only bread and cheese; you may as well letme have that," H'e then squeezed up something, which af terardsascertained to be soap, twas e rtm two and threw it on the oor.

I caunot positively swlear to the prisoner as being one of the men, but he has a great resemblance to him. Ho had no hair round his chin at that time as he has now. The officer said the prisoner, who had for many years been the associate of thieves of the worst character, had only been released from prison the day before the robbery took The prisoner was remanded.

MA OROUGH-STRIT.-Rotert Johnston, of the Army and Navy Club and 29, Webb's Caunty.terrace, descrsbed as agentlema,ascharged with assaulting William Kay, a gentleman of fortune, residing at No. 36, Hill-street, Berkeley-square.

I am'qultc PorePred. to go into the cae. fr.binso.--I ian prepared to answer it, tlesasmttetr should come up which I do not think proper to aiswer. Mr. Bodkin.-I will, now proceed to state the circmnstances which gave rise to this application :-The complai. ant, who is Low 22 yeals of age, unfortunately became the associate or acquaintance of thedfefendant when lhe was about 18 or 19 years of ge. Heis a joungman,of considerable fortune, havig an ncome of 8,OOOL or 9,000 a-year. He became the associate of the defendant before he wAs of age, and vwas led to the continent, where money may easzly be e_pended. The defendant, assisted by two other persons, hving contrived to get from him securities to the amount of 50,0001. or 60,O01Z., his friends interfered. Thber applied to Mr. Galworthy, a respectable solicitor, WhO, by hi promptitude in filing a bill in Chancery, obtained two decrees, whrel All the deeds, bills, and securities acquired by fraud and conspiracy were made void and set aside. I mention this in order that the Court masy understand clearly the nature of the case, and the gosition in which the parties relatively stand towards each other. One night, as Mr. Kay was proceeding to his house in Hill-street, he was inter.ered with by a man mudfled in a cloak, which concealed his features, who asked him if his name was Kay, and, beino told it was, said, " I arrest you for debt." He replied he owed no dobt he could be arre;ted for. The man replied, " Your wife does." The complainant was arrested; ho was not allowed to go into his house, buthe was taken in a cab by the man who arrested him to a house at the west end of the town. He was placed in a room on the ground floor, and the man disappeared, locking him in the room. The complainant sat down to 'wite a letter to his solicitor- whiile thus engaged the door was opened, and the defendant Johnston came in. The comrplainant naturally said, "' Why have I been arrested for debt ?' The defendant replied, "The arrest is nil sham; it was only made for the purpose of getting you here." The defendant then locked the door and commenced a tirade of abuse and slander of the characters of certAin parties, aftervwards makng overtures to revive the association that had already proved so roinous to Kay. The defendant Johnston wonld not permit Kay to depart without extorting a pledge that he would write to him, imd ask him to dine in some place where they could then so arrange as to get the Court of Chancery decrees modified in some way. Now, a promise so obtained is binding neither in law nor honour. As soon as Kay obtained his liberty he sought advice, and in consequence of that step the defendant is here before you. The complainant Kaywasimprisonedthreehours,froml2atnight untal3inthe mornin. Thi.appears tome to beaseriousand scandalous outrage. It arose out of proceedings in a higher court of law, and I thilnk I am justif'edin calhngon yon to ask Johnston to find goocl hail to answer such charge as may be preferred against him in another court. The charge of assault is niade out on the confining and locking him in a room. That is the assault. There canbeno reasonable doubt that the defendant andthe other man were act'ing in concert together. It is not necessary to ShOW who this man is, there being sufficient evidence of conspiracy to enable us to prefer a bill of indictment for conspiracy, and to ask you to require sureties from the defendant to meet the charge. The complaiantwas here called into court. HIe is a youlmg man o ild and diffident aspect. On beirg sworn, he said,- My name is William Kay, and I live at do, Hillstreet, Berlkeley-square. I carae of age in ISM, an!d was then entitled to considerable property. About two years before I came of age I got acquasnted with the defendant. I gave him some bills, ani, after I came of age, somte bonds. A deoree has been obtained to set them aside. Mr. Robinson called for the production of the decree. Mr. Galworthy, solicitor, was called. Ho produced the original decree of the Court of Chancery, and read portions to the effect that a certain bond of assignment was to be delivered up and cancelled; that certain suites of apartments in Hillstreet, Paris, and a place in the country, were to be given up to their owner or owners, together with the furniture ; that an account of all sums of money paid by Johnston to a persocL named Adams, on behalf of the complainant, together with a sum of 30,0001., raised by the plaitiff and handed over to Adams be rendered; andi that all the securities held by certain persons, together with a certain settlemnent of property, were to be entirely void. . Kay's examination resumed.-On Tuesday night, the 8th of July, I was returning home from the Wyndhcnm Club, when I was stopped by a man whom I never saw before, who was dressed in a light opera cloalk with the collar uo, and who said to ma " Are you Mr. Kay?' I said "Y es." tRe replied, " Then, Iarrest you for debt." I said " What debt?' He replied "A debt of your wife's," mentioning the sum and naming the person to whom it was owing. He said he had a writ and a judgment against me, and must take me. The man refused to allow me to go to my lawyer's. He askced me where I preflerred to go-a police-office, the police-station, or a private house." I said, " Let us go te a private office." A cab was passing at the time. He asked me if I would cab it or walk it. I said, I would ride, and we got into the cab, which drove to as house that was strange to me, and which I afterwards found out was No. 1, Park-street. I asked the man when we were in the cab if I might writetomy lawyer. He said, "Yes; and you will be at home in half an hour." I was shownl into the dining-room, whore there were pens and paper. The man left the room, and I sat down to write to my lawyer. While doing. this the door opened, and Johnston ~walked in. He said to me, after locling the door and taking out the key, "I desired to have an interview with you." I asked him if I might send. a letter to my lawyer. He refused compliance, but I do not recollect his precise words. I told him I had been arrested for a debt of my wife's. He said he did not know anything about the depat. He admitted in the COulrSe of the eveningf that he had no other means of obtaining an interview with me than by the means he had used. I said, " Am I here against my will?'" or word s to that effect, and I cannot recollect his answer. I said, in answer to his question, "I am in your power." He then began to make certain statements against persons interested for me, which I believed to he calumnious. He spoke disresnectfilly of my wife and some friends. He asked me to refer the matters between us to arbitration, and to set aside the judgment that had been obtained. He mentioned the name of a person to whom he wi;hed the matter to be referred. I did not agree to the offer. I said I would abide by the determ ination at which the Court of Chancery had arrived. He asked me if that was my decision, or words to that effect. I said " Yes." I beheve Johnston then left the room for a minute or tvo, and I believe he unlocked the loor, and he locked it outside. I did not try if the door was locked. Mfy belief is ihat the door was locked. Johnston returned, and when he shut the door I believe he locked it. He then wished m.e to appoint a meeting, and he mientioned the name of a person who had called at my law3-er's. I said I would made no M.ointment, and he then replied that I had better go to Mr. BE3ADoN.-Why were you to go to bed? Complainant.-I was to stay in the house. I was not to be allowed to go out. Mr. BEADOX.-Did you ask Johnston if you mighit leave t'he house ? Complainant.-I did, and I believe he said, " You shall stay here until you consent to do what I want you to do." At first I said I would take a bed, but Johnston did not press this upon me. When he found I would not mrake an appointment he asked me to write and fix ah appointment. I had been in the house some time then, and ]: said if yoa will let me go now I wiUl not mention anything that has occurred. He said, "I will not letyougo untilyougiveyour word and honour that you will tell nothing that has passed to night to anybody." I did make that promise, and also that I wouldwrite to lim. I was allowed to go home after being detained in the house about three hours. While I was in the house the defendant asked me to have some brandy and water, beLt I refured, not being thirsty. I was to-wzite to the defendant and direct to the Army and Navy Club, he being a member, I believe. Mr. Bobinson, having requested Mfr. Kay to retir, 'proceededto say that he hardly knew what course to pursue, as the two charges of assault and conspiracy had been mised up together. With regard to the assault, he had to submit to the Court that no coercion had been used, and that no one laid hands on the comrnlainant. Mr. lxAnOir undcstoodi that the man who arrested the complainant laid hands on his shoulder. Air. Kay was recalled. He said the man touched hlim on the shoulder, but not Johnston. Mr. Robinson said, it was clear there was no touching by Johstonn tuanyway. Te tachingby the first man wa not touchi_g by the second. The magistrate would refuse to stretch the law to meet a case of this kind merely because his learned friend bad called it an outrageous assault. Mr. BEAnox.-The lock was turned upon him, Mfr. Bobinson.-Is that an assault? -Mr. BEAnoW.-Oh, certainly; imprisonment is an assault. M1r. Robinson.-Looldng at the extraordinary way in which Kay has given his evidence, and recollecting that he made no attempt to open the door, can it be said the'e was imprsonment or assault? r. BrD hON.-No force cof an- kidn appears tohavaltbeen put upont him. He seems to 'have g5ne willingly. Ho appears to be a weak young nman, for ho does not appear to havo even attempted to assist himself in the sail htest degree. He chooses to go to a private house insteal of a station-house, where he would have been safe, and when he ts to Johnston!s house he does not attempt to rescue niself. No foreo is lima. Mr. hodn-Johnston srid, "I shali not let you go until you do what I want." e o g ni Mfr. BzAnos.-The lock was turned on him, and that certainly is an assault. He did not mnow how the miatter of the fictitious arrest might turn out. It would bo a very serious businessif an illegil process had been resorted to for ulterior objects. The young man. appeared to have gone quietly, and the question was, was thi sin assaut: tthat required moro than sureties to keep the peace? Therquestion of conspiracy was an entirelyr different case. Mr. Rbinson.-It was only a -ime to procure- an in e r.

Officer, do you describe the SergeantYoay, 7 I.-The prosecutor, a very resptable man, is the owner of two publichoush= near each other, and oneo which-was formerly tenanted by & person named George. This person Was charged witr having in his possession a boxo0fadedfrit which had been stolen from the railway, and being obliged, consequently, to give up his house, the prosecutor was compelled to send hs wife there to look after the business while he took care of the other honse. The prisoner at that time loKlged in the first house and it is supposedthat an improper uaintsnce then commenoed between him and the wife of the prosecutor. Mrs. Quantrell subsequently returned to her husbmd'shouse, but on Monday last took advantage of her husband being asdeep to abscond fromthe house with a great deal of property, the prisoner being connected with it in the way shown by some witnesses I hAve here. The prosecutor and two friends met the prisoner in Brick-lanie, and, bringing him to me at the statio-house, cha,ued him as he is now charged. there being 41. Os. 9,,d. foun on biin, and a savings-bank-book, showing that money had just been dra,wnuout. Xothing has been seen of either the wife or,-the property since, but it is believed she has been living at Bow. Prosecutor.-My wife absconded on Monday while I was lying down, but the money was taken while I was out. She asked my son for the key, wlhich he gave her ard she wanted that of the iron chest, but I, fortunately, had that in my pocket, or she would most probablyhave tal-en much more. The prisoner was at that time lodging at miy other house, and Iinstantly suspected, on discovering she had gone, that shl had gone with him. Samuel Bouverie, cab-driver.-On Monday week, about 6 in the evening, I took up a lady at the prosecutor's house, and drove her to a coffee-house opposite the Waterloo station of the South-Western Eailway. The lady paid me, and when she entered the house the prisoner came in and spoke to her. I was at the Eastern Counties Bailway when I was hired by the prisoner, who told me to drive to the prosecutor's house. I told him to get up and ride, bat he refused, saying he was not going. Theladyhadno box with her, but she had so largea bundle that it was the size of a bed, which I thought it was at first. It was so large I could hadly get it into my cab. I know the prisoner by sight very well, and when he came into the coffeehouse to which I had diven the lady he said, " It's all right ;" but what else he said I cannot recollect Mar Poole.-My Drother keeps the Cambridge and lNorfolk Copand Coffeehouse, opposite the.Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. I did not see the lady and prisoner come to the house, but I saw them sitting together about half-past S. They gave no name, but said they had arrived from Uverpool that morning, and were going to start the following morning for Southampton. They after. wards went upstairs together, and sleuÂ¶; together. The lady had a large bundlewith her, and the prisonercarried itup to their room. We, of course, supposed them to be man and wife. The waiter attended upon them, and be was paid but I aon!t know which paid. The srisoner left the bedroom first, saving the lady was pacling some things from tne bundle inbo a box. He said to the lady, who was weening very much at the tine, " I shaUl return about 10 o'clocl;, and get what you like, vou had better have some brandy." The prosecutor, who had been compelled to hold his hand before his face to conceal his emotion, here became so affected that he was obliged to leave the court. The witness continued.-The prisoner did return. and canied abox do;nstairs, when the waiter took it from him and carried it across the road. Prosecutorrecalled.-I have also missed waistcoat pieces, and other atiles-* I really cannOt tell what is missing, but I find it is a great deal more than I at first supposed. Thomas Qruntrell, l4.-On Monday my brother called to me for the keys, saying my mother w7mtedthem . and Igave them to him for her. On the same day my mother sent for the prisoner, who came, but left after stoppig a short time. fr. DTY\corT_.-This evidenco is not sufficient for rae to keep the prisoner, but I shall call upon him to enter into his own recognizances to appear a.d answer the charge again next week. Mr. Heritage, who was retained for the defence.-I beg, Sir, to apply for the restoration of the money that was found on my client by the police. Mr. lYEYNcouRT.-2No; I shall say nothing about giving that uD: the officer can do as he thinks proper.
