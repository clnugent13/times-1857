The TImperial Hotel Company has been formed,-with limited liability, under the Act of last Session, for the purpasse of building a large hotel, on the principle of the great Hoeld du louvre, rue Ilivoli, Paris. Parliamexnt having purchased a sito for a newr National Gallery at K:ensingtona. the site and adjacent groemdnowoccupiedby the Na tional Gallery, Trafalgar-squssre, is, mn every respect, oe of the finest and Most appropriate that couid be selected In Londion for such an hoteL As investmen-ts for capital such undertakings have proved highly successful. The leading canitalistn in Europe and Amlerica have united an Promoting them. The Great Western Hotel in Londoun. oni the same principle, has proved to be a highly remaiiuerative inavestmient - the net protits in the Last division were 31 per cent, per annum, anti the dividendI p aid was at the rate of £25 Per cent. ner annum. The shares have about doubled in value, and, although it has niot been in operation two years, it is too small to meet the daily aPPlications for accommiodation. The profits of the Imperial Hotel, fxom its superior sitration and many other advantage-s, wfi be at least equal to the moat lucrative undertakings of a similar niature. A Bill giving powers to the Comnpany,vwith reference to the site in Trafalgar-squane, has bieeni read a second time in the House of Commons. An instralmet of £2 per share is reqjuired to obtain complete registration with limited liability; butshouldithat orthe site niot be obtained the deposit will be returned to the shareholders, less a sum naot exceedirag Is. per share on aceount of expense.

PARLIAfMENTARY JTBLLIGENC. IOtJSE OF LORDS, Twmsmy, A?Bm 17. The LonD CH.LCELLOn took his seat on the Woolsack at 5 o'clock. The Earl of ST.

ASAPH presented a petition against the abolition of church-rates without an equivalent. L ordDYlN'EVOR presented petitions-to the Same effect. The Earl of DEBBY presented a petition to the same effect, and also a petition against the Church DisciDline l TEHE FIRE BRIGAfDE m TEE HOUSE. ILord STANLEY of ALDEELEY, having stated that he had no objection to lay upon the table the correspondence that had taken place beteentheoBoard of lWork's and the Treasury, with respect to the transference to the police force of the duties heretofore discharged by the ire bngzade, observed that it wFas mntended to employ in the performance of those duties one inspector, two sergeants, and sixteen constables. Itwas.axobservation of theefficient nmanner in which the arangements for the prevention of fire were conducted under the superintendence of the police at the Woolwich dockyards that had sugysstedthe propriety of establishing the same systemintheriouse of Lords. Lord REDESDALE confessed his entire inability to understand eitherthe policy or thejusticeoftheproposed change. (Hear. hear.) On the contrary, he had a strong convection that the safety of the building would not be adequately provided for unless it were confided to the care of a body of men intrustedwith that duty and none other. The fire brigade were in that position. They were acquainted with every pipe thathad been laid down, whether for gas or water; they were fuUy cognizant of all the duties connected with the arrangements for the security of the house, and they were in all respects as zealous andefficient as the men pro- tobo substituted for them could possibly be. (Hear, -aear.) The new system wrould occasion a great increase of expense, for the men about to be brought in were exKactly twce the number of those whom they would supplant. The greater part of these men had been engaged for eight years; some of them for a longer period than that. They had farihes, and were men whose age and statureprevented them entering the police force.- Being in the servce of the Government, they were naturally under the impression that their engagement was for life; but notwithstanding that they had alwayS behaved admirably they were now cast upon the world without resources. Nay more, they were, before leaving, required to instruct the men who were to turn them out of their situations. It enightbe said that the engagement with these men did not dfer from that with the servants of railway companies or other public bodies; but certainly no such body would, when dischargig servants, require them to teach their duties to those who were to succeedthem. He thought that the proposed change was one which would press very hardly upon the firemen, and would not tend to the security of the building. N\or was this only his own opinion? Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney, to whom was intrusted the whole charge of the lghtmg and ventilation of the house, had that morning caUed uponi him. (Iord Redesdale), and exuressed his opinion that under the new arrangement the building would not be so safe as it was under the existing one. The matter well deserved the consideration of the Government, and he (Lord Redesdale) hoped that the proposed change would not be adopted without further inquiry. The Duke'of SOMERSET said, that in his opinion, the existing system of firemen was not a good one. Within the last six years there had. been a fire which exposed the building to great danger, and in connexion with which it was shown that there was much mismanagement. It was most important to thesfety of the building that this system shouldb revised and reconsidered. Those who had charge of the pipes ought also'to have charge of the cisterns. When the fire to which he had alluded occurred, the cisterns were empty, owing to the water having been drawn off for other purposes without the knowledge of the firemen, who had no control over them. Unless there was one common control over the water, both in supply and delivery-whether by policemen or firemen did not matter -the danger which had occurred six years ago might occur again. Lord STANLEY of ATLDELEY entirely concurred with his noble friend that considerable danger arose from a divided control, as had been shown by the occurrence of the fire to which the noble duke had referred. At that time the custody of the house was in the hands of Sir Charles Barry; the Board of Works had a certain power; and the firemen were a third body, under their own head. It was now proposed that the authority of Sir C. Barry should cease, and that the whole control and guardianshiip of the buildings should be transferred to the First Commissioner of Works, who alone would be responsible for theirsafety. It was also thought desirablethat thereshould be no divided authority over the men who had the protection of the buildings. If there were firemen who had to look to one authority, and policemen who had to look to another, and to give aid or not as they might think fit, there might be a great conflict of authority, and would certainly be an absence of that uniformity of action which was necessary in order to prevent the recurrence of danger from fire. Instead of increasing -the proposed system would considerably diminish, the expense of watching the houses. The estimate of the probable expense, of the nnited bodies of firemen under Ar. Brady, and of- policemen, was 3,005.; while the whole expense of the police, who would be available both for the protection of the buildings and for ordinary purposes, would not exceed l,5001. a-year. The cisterns would be under the innuediate control of the Clerk of the Works, who would be always resident in the Palace, who was an officer of the Board of Works, and who would Invariably be in direct communication with the superintendent of the police, who would also be resident within the building. TEE DESPATCH OF TROOPS TO BRIMSH NORTH AA MRICA. The Earl of ELGIN asked his noble friend the Secretary for War whether there was any truth in the report that it was the intention of the Government considerably to increase the British forces in Canada? Lord PA3NMURE.-There is a general impression out of doors that a very large force is about to embark for British North America. It is quite true-that it is our intention to send back to North America a certain number of regiments which were taken from that part of Her Majesty's dominions for the purpose of carrying on the wnar; and it is not improbable that in the new organization of the army, by divisions and brigades, which is contemplated, there will, over all the North American provinces, be a small addition to the British army; but the impression that we are about to send thither a large force for purposes of aggression is entirely without fo-a.. dation. It is also stated-and I am glad to have this opportunity of explaining that too-that large quantities of munitions of war are being sent to British North America. The fact is, that during the war we drew from the British North American stores almost all the munitions of war, in the shape of ganpowder and other materials, which they contained. AU that is now being done is to replace the stores which were drawn thence. INDI)AN TERRITORIES. The Earl of AL;BE?ARTJE gave notice that he should, on an early day move the reappointment of the Committee on Indian Territories. PUBLIC WORKS BILL. This bil was read a second time. PUBLIC WORKS (IRELANTD) BILL. Tne Pablic Works (Ireland) Bil was also read a second time, Lord STA.NIXEY of AIDERLEY stating, in answer to a question from the Earl of CLAycARTY, that it had nothing to do with arterial drainage. PUIBLIC EDUCATION. The Bishop of OXFORD rose to ask his noble friend the President of the Council what was the intention of the Government with regard to the bil touching education which he had introduced into their lordships' House? Earl GRANIVLE said that, although one of the principles upon which his bill was founded was involved in the propositions which had recently been discussed bi anotlher place, he did not think it logically followed that, because those propositions had been rejected, a similar fate would necessarily attendh measure, which was wholly of a permissive character. (Hear, hear.) It was, however, very undesir'able, when measureswere not likely to be carried, or at least when the Government did not see their way to carrying them, that they should be proceeded with at the risk of exciting any sectarian and angry feelings, and for those reasons he did not propose to press this measure on their lordships' attention any further, at least during the* present session. *HEREDITARY PENSIONS. On the motion of Lord MrO?N-AGLE, a retUrn was ordered, showing the particulars of the hereditary pensions which have been redeemed in the year ending the 31st of March, 1856, by an issue of 213,1771. Is. 2d., the principle on which such redemption money was calculated, and copies of the warrants, minutes, or other instruments by which such issue of public money has been directed. Their lordships then adjourned at 25 minutes to 6 oclock.

ErDICAT RTsinWmn TBELAXD.-A small bluebook, of 150 pages, contains the fourth annual report of the commissioners for administering the laws for the relief of the poor in Ireland, under the act 14th and o1th of Victoria, chap. 66, commonly called the Medical Charities Act. It is shown by the learned commissioners that i7r the year ended the 30th of September, 1855, 732,56S persons were relieved under the act throughout Ireland, ,iz.,-583,547 by dispensary, and 149,016 by visiting, tickets. The number relieved-in 1854 was 695,025, and in 1853 690,411 It appears that for the -whole of the country there has been, during the three years of the act's operation, a steady increase anumally in the numbers re. lieved, both at home and at the dispensaries. The total expenditure last year amounted to 89,3$.7 including 6,6934. for rent, 61,4451. for salaries and wages, and 14,864'. formedicines, &c. The Poor Law valuation in Ireland for the year 1855 was 11,564,9271, so that the expense of these medical charities is equivalent to a poundage on the valuation of 1-86d. The commissoners next refer to the important subject of vaccination, and it is truly lamentable to find thatf they have reason to express, in still stronger terms than before, their anxiety and dimtisfaction, not unmLxed with! apprehension, andto record their persuasion, thattbe poweas whichltheyatpresent possess are altogether inadequate to. enablethem to contend successfuly against the principal causes of the evil, viz,-the stupid apathy of the lower orders, their ignorant distrust of vaccination as a prophy. lactic against smallpox, and their wide-spread prejudice in favour of variolous inoculation-a measurewhich the Legislature has justly branded as crimi. naL During the past year the number of vaccinations performed at hthe dispensaries was 46,711, or less by 6,133 tham in the preceding year. Yet it is esti. mated tbat, according to the nmlber of births, taken together with the popuiation 145,600 vaccinations oghttohavre been performed, instead of 51,164 (the total numboer of vaccinations performed under the act and in workhouses ; a fact that excites the most serious apprehensions on thepart of the commissioners, and probably of everv inteliigent person in the country. In short, the ratio of the number vaccinated to the number anvaccinated is onlyas 1 to 2 8. There is reason to believe, moreover, that a large number of personsin Ireland are unprotected against smallpox, eitherbyvaccination or inoculation. The lower orders (and, perhaps, not a few of the higher) entertain a silly notion that the virtue of vaccination is impaired or destroyed by punctur ing the vaccine vesicle for the extraction of lymph for the performance of fresh vaccinations, and in consequence of this prejudice few children are ever brought back to the dispen. saries to enable the medical men to ascertain ite success or failure of the operation. These circumstances have convinced the commissioners of the imperative necessity of some le"islative remedy for the woful state of tbings described, and they make the obvious suggestion to extend the Compulsory Vaccination Act, nows in force in 13ngland, to the sisterkingdom, as they are persuaded "thatinfinite benefit wonld result fromthe enactment of any system of compulsory vaccination." As regards the cholera, it is shown that the last outbreak in Ireland was, comparately speaking, remarkably mild, and the mortality surprisingly low. Some cases are adduced, siving strong suPport to the " contagion" theory of the origin of the disease. The results of the arrangements made to meet the epidemio were most satisfactory, andwere mainlyattributable to the commissioners haming beenenabled tobringinto speedy operation the whole dispensary organization immediately on an outbreak in any locality. The expediency of extending to Irelad the amended sanitary laws, passed for Eng. land in 1855, is urged on the attention of the Government. M an addcndum to this report maybebrieflynoticed that of the Dublin Hospital Commissioners, datedthe 4th of December, 1855. Their recommendations chiefly refer to matters of detail, but they again urge the expediency of appointing a c conduct of these ht itals in fivo years ended March 31, 1855, amounted to 32, 63?., the expenditure to 27,771?., and the total number of patientsi .ad mitted to 16,3S1. ExIKSIvE SEIZURA OF TO WAXELvD.- The Court-house, Wakefield, was crowded on Wednesday last by persons anxious to hear the proceedings relative to the late extensive seizure of flour from Messrs. Jackson and Sons, corn dealers, Wakefield. Eighty-seven sacks had been seized by Joseph Johnson, the sanitary inspector of the boroagb, in February last, from two shops of the defendants, in Westgate and Wrengate, under the impression that they were unfit for human food. Owing to the result of the analysis of Professor Taylor, of London, S2? of these sacks were ordered by the 'xench of nigistrates to be returned to Miessrs. Jackson. The cases before the Bench on WVednesday related to the 4? saclks still retained by the inspector. The presidmg magistrate on the occasion was MUr. Jose.phHoldsworth. NMr. WV. Shaw appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Digby Seymour, 3LP., was speciallyretained for the defendant, assistedbyMr. Micklethwaite. The first chArge preferred against Messrs. JackoLn was for having fiourfor sale intheir shop at Westgate-common on the 26th of February last, the same being unfit for human food, contrary to the statute, Mr. Seymour took objection t'hat the inspector had no aulthority from the local board to proceed with the case to recover penalties, as required by the 18th and 19th of ictoria, cap. 121, sect. 5. lThe Bench considered the information bad as regarded the penalties, but good as re. garded the seizure. The information fell through; and the next case taken was for having flour on their premises in Wrengate on the 25th of February unfit for food, which the inspector prayed might be destroyed. The principal witness called for the prosecution was Dr. Letheby, of the London Hospital, who, having examiined a specimen of the flour, declared it, in his opinion, to be unfit for human food, owing to the gluten of the flour being in a state of decomposition. The Rev. W, ,R Bowditch, Mr. Statter, surgeon, and MWr. Mller, surgeon to the convict department of the House of Correction, aUl gave it as their opinion that the flour was unfit for human food. Mr. Seymour made a. long -an able address for the defenceq and he then called n number of cornofacotrs, including Mir. Thomas Smith, of the firm of Sandsrs and Smith, liver polandManchester ; Mr. W. Nelstrop, late Mayor of Sitockport;Mr.IIarbridgc, biscuit contractor, liverpool; and Mr. Thempson, Wakefield,-all of whom gave it as their opinionthat theflourwas fit for human foodw asr IHuggon, chyanicl lecturer, leeds; Dr. Atkison, phv sician to thcdsenay Waefield; Dr. Craven, of Poth well;* and Professor John T. Way, consulting chymist- to the Royal Agricultural Society, had Al examined portions of the flour, and they deClared it to be fit for hmar food. There was uo trace of adulteration in the flour, and a slight taint which it had obtained might b- been cauaed by the impropr stowing of it during the six weeks since the seizure. The case was dismissed after havieg occupied the Court eight hours. The decision was received with a round of applause by the assembled audience. The case has excited te autmost interest amorg the corudeaiers in. Yorkshlire and L cse.
XoA73Y-MABXBtad CITYIJT-LLIGENC.E Thursday Evening. The English funds opened steadily this morning at the pnices to 'which they had recovered last evening, and before the close of business the marklet experienced a further slight improvemeut. Consols for money were first quoted 93 to i, and after having remained wMithout alteration up to the afternoon theyadvanced to 93i to . For the 8th of May the price throughout the day wVas 93s to A, the alteration that occurred being limited to the money quotation in consequence of the purchases haling been for money ratherthan for time. The announcemnent of the closing of the Paris Congress, together with reports from the Bourse of increased buoyancy in stocks and shares, tended, with the arrival of the Blackwall from Australia, to support the disposition towards firmness. Rumours were also revived of an intention on the part of the French Govern.nent to authorize an increased issue of notes bythe 'Bank of France, although tho letters from Paris to-day make no mention of it. The Bank of England continue to abstain from an equalization of their rates for long and short paper, but the step is expected in the coumse of a week or two. BMoney was in good supply, not only from the recent payment of the dividends, btit also, it is said, fromi the effect of laase disbursements by the Government for general contracts. BIank Stock left off at 212-4 to 213A; Reduced, 91i to 92 ; New- Three per Cents., 92Q to ;- Annuities, 30 years, 37; India-bonds, 10ls, to 5s. discount; Exchlequer-bonds, ~8~ to J; and Exchequer-bills (March) par to 3s. premtium, (June) 3s. to 1s. discount. 'The commercal3 demand for monev falls nowv nlmost wholly on the discount-nasket, owing to the rates being for the moment a fraction below those of the Bank of EngLand. IJnder these circumstances, it is assumed that the position of the Bank must be rapidly improving, as far as regards its reserve of notes. Foreign seciurities have been steady, with a moderate amount of business. In Turkish Sixfper Cents. the transactions were at 98,, J, and ;- for the account. The Four per Cent. Ouaranteed Stock was negotiated at 101? for money, uad 101k and i for the account. The general operations comprised Brazilian, for account, 99A; the Newv, 99,-; Blexican, for account, 227-, 23k, and 22S,; Portuguese Fonr per Cents., for account, 50; Ruissian Five per Cents., 106 and 105k; the Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 95-1 and 95; t;ardinian. Five per Cents., 9P5 and 95 Spanish Three per Cents., for acco'unt, 451; the New Deferred, for account, 24a .nd -I; and Dutch Fotur per Cent Certificates, 93Xand L. ,New South Wales Debentures were sold at :37. i The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening wvere Z4f. for money, and 74f. 50c. for the end of the month, showing a further advance of nearly five-eightlhs per cent. In railwvay shares the activity is still greater, and the fact that the rate of interest for carrying on transactions ranges between 15 and 20 per cent. is regarded with indifference. At Hamburg the pressiure for money increases, the rate of sdiscotnt having riseni to 74 per cent. In Holland the stock-markets are flat, and the exchange on Ilondon has an unfavourable tendeiicy. The Blackwall has arrived from Port Phillip with 8S,281 ounces of gold, valued at S49,1241. iNothing has transpired at present as to the probability of this sum, or a portion of it, being taken to the Bank of England. The mercantile advices by the Overland Mail hbdavingle again favourable, a decided improvement goccurred in the demand for Manchester goods at Bombay, while at Calcutta the market has -een fully maintained at the prices reported by the previous arrival. There is no China mail on this occasion, but dates three days later had been re-ceived at Calcutta-namely, from Elongkong to the 18th of February. The rate of exchange at Canton remained at 5s. 4d. to Id.; Sycee silver had dedlined to S-l. The holydays were not over and business had not been resumned. Mexican dollars in 3fanilla are stated to have risen to 12 per cent. premium, and in London their price has experienced a renewved improvement. The letters from Alexandria to-day state that the Bank of Egypt appears now to be regarded with general favour, and that the arrangements to enable it to commence business are nearly complete. It is understood that a Swiss bank, to be called "The General Bank of Switzerland," vith exclusive pover to issue notes on demand to the extent of three times the amount of its stock of bullion, will be introduced in a few days. Two new clauses, proposed by Mr. Wilson, to be inserted in the bill relating to crossed checks, which is fixed for a third reading this evening, ttave attracted much attention to-clay amono- the banl;in interest. The object of the first clause is to ?,ive ban&kers a legal option of refusing to pay to one banker a cheek crossed to another, while the second provides that the drawer of a check may, by the use of a penny stamp, positively direct it to be paid to a particular banker. These modifications are considered to demonstrate a desire on the part of the Govern.nent to nieet the wishes of the commercial community on the subject, and they have been regarded on that ground with much satisfaction, but it appears that the form in which they are drawvn iip is in several respects thought to be objectionable. An agreement therefore will probably be arrived at to defer for a short time the third reading of the bill, in order that the Govermnuent and the bankers may have an opportunity to concert the precise phraseology that may be desirable. The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been sold at 6ld., showing no variation in the price. The next public sales of colonial Owool are announced to commence on the 8th of May. Since the last sales about 32,972 bales have arrived. The following is from the English and Australian Copper Company -- " The&directors have received advices from their manager, da'tedAdelaide, 25th of Januarylast. The whole of the mule vaggons and harness had arrived, and the smelting opera. t1ons of the company were progressing satisfactorily. The make of copper for the month of January was expected to be about 300 tons. Shipments of copper and ore were being made to Enzland for account of the company."

STATE OF TRADE. MAICHESTER, APRIL 17. Buyers continue to hold back at the extreme prices asked on Tuesday, and rather less business has been done, but with the present state of the cotton-market and the good supply of orders in the hands of bo7th spinners and manufacturers there is little or no disposition to make any abatement. The prices of yarns are ld. to 1d. per lb. higher than last week, and manufacturers are askdng from 1ld. to 3d. per piece higher for shirtings. There is a more g6neral de. mand both for cloth and shirtings than of late, and the market maintains a healthy tone.

We reduce our quotations Is. per quarter on the better descmiptiond of English, and fully 2s on louer Suilities. while Ameriesn declined to a similar extent. The transactions in English four wvere likewise very restricted at a reduction of Is. per sack on the best khids and 2s. on secondary sorts, American, at the snme time, mneeting a tolerably fair sale at Is. per barrel under the ratesof dmiseayseennight. In oats or oatmeal there was no change. Beans and Indian corn were rather easier to purchase. Barley was scarce and the turn dearer. BIRMDUi-11AM, AtRIL 17.

It stated that the committee had held many protracted meetings, and, after a careful investigation had come to the unanitnous opinion that it will be necessary to take power to raise 350, 000. to finish t'he line from Crurlinto =uaker's-yard and to liquidate all exting debts and liabilities. That sum was 83,6021. above the amount estimated by the directors. The committee have received a distinct assurance from the officers of the company,that their wants wouldbefallycoveredby36lTl6!., less ],000!. arrears of, calls on shares and 7191. cash in hand, leavmg 348,9971. to be provided. This amount comprises a sum sufficient to complete a double line from Hereford to Cnuinlin, and a single line from Crumlin, to Qaaker's-yard, ith land, bridges, sidings, and worksfora double lineaxd, large as this sum, is, the committee believe that the result will be satisfactory to the original shareholders, and that the security for the amount required at the present time is ample. They consider that when this railway is opened, which will be within 15 months of this date (should the money now be subscribed) the receipts will rapidly reach a mienirnums sunm of 401. per mile per week, which will be more than sufficient to provide for the interest on all the bonds, on the present 5 per cent. preference shares, and on the proposed new preference 6 per cents., and also to pn a dividend of 3 per cent. per annum to the original shareholders. The Newport, Abergavenny, and Ilereford line,' like the Taff Vale line, passes through a rich and active mineral district; the latter 40 miles in length, has cost about 27,7001. per mile; the former, 50 miles in length, will have cost about 25,0001. per mile. The Taff Vale is taking an average of fully 951. per mile per week, and the committee can see noreasonto doubt, from the data laid before them by parties well acquainted with the locality and its traffic, that the revenue of the Newport and Hereford Railway will considerably exceed even their present estimate of 401. per nile per week. The construction of the Worcester and Hereford Railway is of the greatest importance to the Newport and Hereford Company, and the coumaittee recommend the proprietors to give it every assistanceinttheirpower. The committee recommend the creation of a new b per cent. preference stcek to the extent of one share of 101. for every original share in the comnpany, whichi will amount to 216,8401., and that the same should in tlho first instance be offered, p7'o ratd, to the proprietors of the original stock. The remaining part of the 350,0001. they recommend to be raised by debentures. The committee strongly recommend the proprietors to take their proportion of the 6 per cent stock, from the absolute necessity of the cbmpany being put in Ipossession of immediate funds. The commnittee conclude by I recommending that the board should be strengthened by the introduction of two more gentlemen of business habits, as the success of the undertaking must depend upon the assiduity, ability, and discretion of the managements, and in thlis viev, the directors concur. The commnittee state that the directors have afforded every faciltyduringthe investigation, and that 31r. Pritchard, the secretary, and the other officers of the company have also given their hearty co-operation M1r. J. HuvCHsNSOx, chairman of the committee in moving the reception of the report, said that they had endeavoured to ascertain the highest amount that would he required to complete the works; at the same time they were anxious to raise as little as possible on preference shares. He hoped the shareholders in general would take up their proportion of the 6 per cent, shares, as he could assure them the committee intended to take up their proportion. The C5mItAIIiM said, be was glad that the committee had confirmed wvhat he had stated on former occasions in respect to the value of their property, and he had b reat pleasre in seconding the motion. After some observations the report was unanimously adopted. A PROPRIETOR said, he had no confidence in the estimate, and he wished to know what guarantee they would have that the works vould be completed for the amount stated 9 The CHAIRMAN said that the only guarantee he would give w as, that the whole would be compIeted for 250,0001. less than the Parliamentary estimate. (3eai, hear.) MIr. HUTCHINSON said, the committee had done all that men could do to ascertain the probable cost of the works and the liabilities of the company, and they believed the amount of capital stated would be sufficient to complete the undertaking, and thatthe estimates of traffic would bemore than realzed. Resolutions were passed rescinding the resolution passed at the last meeting for raising 200,0001. on preference shares and authorizing the directors to raise 216,8401. and 6,0201. on 101. preference shares entitled to G per cent. per annum in perpetuity, and to rank as to preference with the 100,0001. 5 per cent. preference stock] created in 1854; authorizing the directors to issue to the public at par or above par any portion of the preference shares that muglht not be taken up by the shareholders; also authorizing the directors, so soon as the company were in a position to do so, to exercise the borrowing powers to the extent of 133,1601. On the motion of the CssA usN, seconded by Mr. SNoW, the best thanks of the meeting were unanimously passed to the conimittee of shareholders for the time and attention they had bestowed in preparing their report on the affairs of the company. A vote of thank-s to the Chairman concluded the proceedings. RAILWAY BILLS I' PARLIAMENT.

LONDON GENERAL 0miBus C? rAsxy.-This company,by way of introducing the French omnibus " correspondence" system tw the inhabitants of this metropolis, commenced it on Monday morning last upon their Barnet line. The Royal Mil omnibuses (formerly the property of 3Mr. M'Namara) ply between the Post-office and Barnet four times n-day, vi-d Aldersgate-street, St. John-street-road, Islington, HIigbhury, Eolloway, figate, ;Finchley, and Whetstone. Hitherto passengers have been carried by them on the directline, only atls. 6d. foX inside and Is. for outside places, and any person desirinto go to anyether part of town than that in the immediate route of the Barneb omnibus has had either to walk or take another vehicle and pay a farther fare. By the new arrangement the ls. 6d. or Is. includes the right of conveyance to Chelsea, Picca,. dill, Westminster, Strand, any part of the Nev-ro-d orCity-road,London-bridge, orFenchurch-street,5the only stipulation being that the passenger asks for a "correspondence ticket" when he pays the Barnet Qnductor his fare. The changing stations from the Barnset omnibus to those for Strand, Westminster, City-road, London-bridge, and Fenchurch-street, are at the eompany's (late Wilson's) yara at HBghbury; and for Regent-street, Piccadilly, Chelsea, or New-road at tim Angel, Islington. The system of tickets adopted is sld.iar to that used on railways. We understand that it isthe intention of the company to test the system on this line of road for a short time, with a view to its introductien at an early dait. in connexion with tha Edm-ntg9n3 Wtodford, andI otD!r suburban distriots.

MEETING OF AfIDDLESEX MAGISTBATES. A general meeting of the Middlesex magistracy was held yesterday at Clerkenvwell; Mr. Pownall in the chair. On the motion of Mr. Kn3snxAD, Chairman of the Committee on Accounts andc for General Purposes, the Court made an order on the county treasurer for the payment of bills, salaries, and demands for the quarter, to the amount of 13,4011. Ss. lid.; and ordered an ordinary county rate of SL in the pound, and a rate of 4d. under the Lunatic Asylums Acts. 3fr. meisrInAD then read some correspondence-hich had taken place between the Rev. G. W. White, rector of Darlaston, South Staffordshire, and Mr. Brent, deputy coroner for Middlesex. The rev. gentleman complained, in his letter addressed to Mr. Wakley, of the pain and annoyance caused to the family in consequence of a posC m4rttem examination having been ordered uponthe body of his brother, MIr. White, late of UpperGrafton-street,whichdidnot take place, it being foundthat there was no necessity for it, as his brother died from congestion of the brain, and had been attended by two medical men. Mr. Brent, the deputy-coroner, in his answer to the letter, explained that the inquest had been ordered upon the report of an intelligent officer, and said that there had been every desire to meet the wishes of the relatives. Mr.: Kemshead deprecated the practice of holdinginquests upon the vague report of a constable, and said he hoped the Court would not allow the matter to pass without special notice. It was not improbable that there were many cases, notwithstanding the vigilant inquiries of the committee, in which there had been as little necessity for inquests, and it was afact wsich ought to be well known to the ratepayers that the cost to the county for coroners' inquests was something like 10,000l. a-year. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Wakley's accounts for inquests for the last six weeks amounted to 1001. per week. The constable received a fee for giving information to the coroner, and the more cases he gotinpof course the greater his fees. The whole matter deserved a strict investigation. Herewas a case of the body of a gentleman being taken from the coffin after the lid had been screwved en-such was its condition that it had to be buried the day after death-to undergo a post vzorlcen examination, under a warrant issued by the coroner on the idle gossip of a constable, who had heard that the deceased bad been found insensible, while the fact was he had taleled rationally of his complaint and was attended till death by two medical mess, wlho knew the cause of death. He woald repeat that it was a most flagrant instance of the improper exercise of the coroner's authority. The deputy-coroner had asserted tlsat Mr. Waldley did not Inow even of the inquest, but the summoning constable had since stated that he gave theinformation to Mr. Wak;ley himself and that Mr. Wakley issued the warrant. (Hear, bear.) Mrr. PAYNE (coroner) said he regretted to hear that the annual costs of inquests to the county was~ so great as 10,000?. He knew a little.of such matters, and he tliouglst he could say that the cost for the city of London and Southwark hoas short of 1,000?., and that district comprised the great hospitais. On the motion of Mr. HxA.Ery the matter was referred to the Committee of Accounts and General Purposes to investigate and report to the Court. Sir A. SPEA-RAN' moved, in accordance with the decision of the Court at a speca meeting on the 27th ult., that the committee of the lunatic asylum at Hanwell be authorized to raise the sum of 70,0001. to carry out the alterations of which the plans were submitted to the Court in the report of the committee. A long discussion ensued, in which it was urged that there were still 1,100 pauper lunatic patients to be provided for, and it was a question of an outlay of 120,000?. to enlarge the present asylums, or one of 300,0001. to build a thi-d. Tte motion was agreedto. Mr. CoTTREcL then moved for 50,000?., to be raised by mortgage on the county rate, to carry out the enlargement of Colney Hiatch Asylum for the accommodation of 63M additional patients. This motion wras also 'agreed to, as was one brought forward by Mr. Atugustinilo7binson, for 11,000?. for increasing the accommodation and providing a nsew infirmary at the Westminster House of Correction. After a discussion upon the treasurer's accounts and the disposal of some routine business the meeting adjourned.

ANCI-T SEPUeIHRAL REI,Ics un PzRTxSHiRE.- A highly iuteresting discovery of sepulchral relics has within the last few days been made in the grounds of IYr. Stirling, "of Reir, MP. In the course of construct-mg a new walk in the park a place of ancient sepultuie waidiscovered. Numerous cinerary urns, full of calcined mones, were found aced at irregular distances and within i few inches of the surface. Ainong theincinerated resmi,were mnany fragments of burnt hones, -which have ~beea~ctrefully jpreservea. About the centre of the sepulchral bed the bones I fa3 skeleton were found ertended at full lenth northI east and south-west. Along with several thc -were in. advertently destroyed by the workmen- have . li wise been discovered two renmrkably perfect spe cimens of the " incense cup," or bowl of -i4tile ware. They both conLtained inte-esting remains.- The p sence of these remains, along v.ith the fragmentg of copper in the urns now discovered, would point their orig;n to the transition era between tho stone and bronze PeTW&d of the archtologist; while-the position of the sepulcral deposits, as well as the worlimanship on the urns, would refer to a period-when interment near the surface had sEupersedel the practicr of inhumiation in the huge eromiech and 'chin.

EXHIBITION OF THE BOYAL SCOTTISR ACADEMY, EDINBURaUr. The artists of the Modern Athens, although they exhibit many works of merit, have produced fewer works this year of the class which at once fix the eye, as the pictures of the exhibition, than is usually the case. This apparent mediocrity is in part produced by some cf the most distinguished artists preferring to send their principal pictures to the Royal Academy Exhibition inLondon-a faetasregards the centralization of the metropolis which we wonder ha3 hitherto escaped the notice of the champions of the wrongs of Scotland. The president, Sir JohnWatson Gordon, exhibits two adluirable portraits, those of Lord Dunferniline and Mr. Colin Campbell. They are painted with great force and fieedom, and are an agreeable contrast to the generality of respectable persons and their spouses who, " done in oil," gaze upon us from the wgzuous. The portraits bf MIr. Colvin Smith display great talent and vigour, especially those of members of the coarser sex. We imagine, however, that an equal aimount of force might be obtained without painting the shadows on his faces with asphaltum and black. "A Girl with Flowers" and " Scotch Lassie crossing a Burn," by Mr. Gralham Gilbert, are remarkable for their tone of colour and handling. " Design," bythe sanie artist, is the " Scotch Lassie" "got up" ina satin gown, and holding a new sketchbook in her hand. Each of these threepicturespossesses charm of colour and much good feeling in the treatment, but we malst confess that the constant repetition of similar subjects and the introduction of the same fair-haired Titianesque damsel into most of his pictures make us doubt somewvhat in the powers of imagination of the artist. The portrait of a yellow satin dress, with a lady contained therein, by Air. Graham Gilbert, is, we hiave no doubt, a very satisfactory one to the lady's maid who prepared that dress for the occasion. The hand and arm of the lady, which are stretched out stiffly, with the tips of the fingers resting on a table iu the conventional manner of old portiaits of field marshals and statesmen, are, we presume, put into that position for the purpose of displaying to effect the jewelry of their possessor. This, we may remark, is a favourite attitude wvith the artist. In the centre room wre remark the "Bathing Poor' and the "Weary Gleaners," by Mr. Robert Gavin. The latter, especially, is a charming picture, full of infantine grace and nature. MIr. Gavin is very rich and mellow in his colouring, and is peculiarly happy in his representations of children. Mlr. R. T. Ross exhibits some genre pictures of great merit; we especially notice "The Bible" and the "Dancing Lesson ;" both are painted with great delicacy and ease of finish The latter represents a little six-years-old lassie learniug the first principles of the reel from her brothers and sisters on the stone floor of the cottage kitchen. The figure of the barefooted little maiden is full of motion and childish glee. Mr. Noel Paton exhibits only one smaU picture, " Watching the Pass." It is of considerable artistic merit, but inferior in interest to his moro carefully prepared works"Oberon and Titania," and "Paolo andErancesca," which were exhibited on former occasions. This is an artist of whom the Scottish Academy may well be proud, as well as of his brother, Air. Walter Paton. " Whew! caught again," by Mr. Erskine Nicol, is an Irish cottage scene, depicted -with great humour. The unexpected entry of an old woman into the cabin surprises a redheaded "M Mike " in the midst of his attentions to a bouncing, blackhaired, gray-eyed Eathleen, who with a goodnatured laugh is escaping from him and his bothering. The tangle into which the ball of worsted has worked itself showsthat the stocking has not progressed during the interview. The half-confused, half-laughling expression of Mike is capital, aud trl-y Milesian. "A Turf Cot; Returning fiom the Bog," is a calm sunset scene, with a barge and figures in the foreground. The quiet evening effect is well rendered. There is a certain pensiveness about the figures -which harmonizes well with the still scene, and shows Mir. Nicol to be capable of other things besides farce and humour. There are a great many pictures by the same artist, aU remarkable for expression of character and freedom of handling. " The Sermon," by Mfr. John Stirling, was exhibited last year at the Academy Exhibition, Loncdon. This young artist is another proof of the vigour and oiginality of the Scotch school, but, mu ch as we admaire his picture, we must protest against the want of beauty in the female figure. She hardly deserves to distract the attention of her neighbour even from the sixteenthly of the minister. Mr.: George Harvey, whose picture of the " Free Church Minister leaving the Manse" -was exhibited in London at the time of what is called the " disruption in Scotland," has twvo landscapes, rich inr colourand truthful in detail. In the foreground of one of them the Rev. Dr. Guthrie is represented " striking" a trout. We are glad to see that for a -Scotch divine to recreate himself with that which was an apostolc occupation is no longer reckoned a sin. The know.ing turn of the Doctor's wvrist indicates thatthis is not the first fish he hashooked. Mrss. Hugh Blackburn possesses great talent in the delineation of animals. Hfer " Scene on the Carrick Coast" shows greatpower. Two of the original draxin,ggs for the "Illustrations o'f the Animals of Scripture" are well knov;n to the public by the p)hotographs of that most artistic w.ork. Mrs. Blackburn's picture of "IKitiewakes"' is hardly worthy of her other pictures. WTe recommend to her notice Gudin's picture of the same subject. We understand that MIrs. Blackburn is an amateur. MIr. Douglas has twoo carefully-painted and wellimagined pictures-" The Tempter" and "The Rosicrucians." As much cannot be said for a great many otier pictures. It is to be regretted that facility of painting and a ready sale of small pictures should tempt artists to be content with producing pictures which seem to be little more than portraits of their lay figures variously attired. In contradistinction to such works are two small pictures by two very young artists, Iessrs. John and Alexander Burr-" Little Kate" a-nd the "A pple Stall." W%Nre trust that these young gentlemen may meet with the success which the merit of their first efforts seems to promise. Photography and pre-Raffaelitism have had their influence among the landscape painters, and the effect is seen in the greater truthfulness of many of their pictures; yet we must think that a paling and a barrel, however truthfully ancd lovingly painted, are scarcely worthy objects for so much care and love; and we regret that an artist who can paint so well has not chosen a more interesting subject. The best among the landscapes are by Mr. WValler Paton-" ARiver Scene!' and "A Summer Night in Arran." This young artist seems to be prosing his -armour at all points for the artistic struggle, for his three pictures are perfectly -tnlike one another in treatmentaand manner. The "RiverScene" possesses a strong foreground of the most startling brightixess and finish. It is a bright, sunny, and truthful picture. The "Summer Night' is less elaborately painted, but is the more successful work of the two in making us forget the paintbrush in the- feeling of the soft twilight of a midsumnmer night in the north.

rONADONg, FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 1856. In the House of Lords yesterday, Lord REDESDALE again put his questioni to the Government on the substitution of the police for the firemen attached to the house. Lord STAUNLEY of ALDERLEY explained that it was intended to adopt the plan followed in the dockyards. The police were beinginstructed in the duties required, and every care would be taken that the building should be fully protected. Lord REDESDATE was not satisfied with the explanation; the a ngement would double the expense, be a great hardship to the men discharged, and not increase the security of the building. The DuLe of So3iERsET thought it necessary the former system should be revised, and all the arrangements placed under the control of one authority. Great danger had arisen from the cisterms being under one authority and the engines and pipes under another. Lord STANLEY of ADEm=Y denied that the expense would be increased; as the police would be available both for their ordinary duties and that of firemen, the expense would be diminished. In answer to a question from the Earl of ELGiN, Lord PAnmurn stated that an impression which had gone abroad, that a large military force was about to be embarked for the British possessions in North America, was without foundation. It was intended to send there a certain number of regiments returning from the Crimea to replace those which had been withdrawn; but that a very large force was to be despatched to our North American colonies was an unfounded rumour. It had been a]so stated that great quantities of munitions of r war were also on the point of being sent to those colonies. The fact was that during the recent war the colonial dep6ts had been drawn upon largely for this description of stores, and all that was about to be done was to replace the quantity that had been so removed. The Earl of MUEisAR.aE gave notice he should on an early day move the re-appointment of the Committee on Indian Territories. The Public Works (Ireland) and Public Works (England) Bills were read a second time. The Bishop of OXFORD asked whether it was the intention of the Government to proceed with the Education Bill ? Earl GB vm.vLv stated that it was not the intention of the Government to press the bill, at least durinong the present session.

A few days ago we descanted upon the difficulty of that great problem, the administration of India. We might call this not only a difficulty, but a prodigious anomaly. It combines diffictulties which, formidable even when separate, become appalling by their combination, exhibiting the fusion of all discordant elements into a hard and unmalleable whole. A population constituted of two races, one of which wasthe victorious, the other the vanquished race, each retaining its own religion and the habits which that religion has impressed upon it-each to the peculiarities of religion adding the peculiaritie3 of blood, and both, moreover,impressed with thosa distinct characteristics which a conimon origin has transmitted to the whole Oriental family,-this population, which numbers 110 millions of human beings, which is scattered over an area equal to three great European kingdoms, which for two thousand years has been exhausting the experience of Eastern despotism, which has never known or till lately heard of a standard of public moralty or public opinion, whic'i has grown uip generation after generation in the abject awe of power and the abject adoration of its trappings, which has recognized revenge, and cruelty, and lust as the legitimate attributes of successful conquerors or the legitimate retaliation of offended and triumphant tyrants,-this population is to be governed by the deputy of a remote Sovereign, whose crown rests upon the broad basis of law, freedom, and opinion, and whose European subjects apply to the government of her dependency the principles and maxims of Rumnymede and St. Stephen's. To reconcile these contradictory exactions-to govern India so that native subjection may not be jeopardized, or native respect destroyed, or native prejudice outraged on the one side or Enoglish opinion offended, or even English fanaticism alarmed, on the other-so that we may still remain the lords of that varied and uncombining people, butw,ithout the reproach of the crimes which follow conquest-to make a gigantic empire not only not onerous and disreputable, but honourable and profitable,-such is the task that the British nation devolves upon those on whom it confers the administration of India, and more especially upon the foremost man among themthe Governor-General. It is a task which, discharged according to the mere letter of instrections, demands no small ability, temper, discretion, and conscientiousness; but which, to fulfil it in a large and comprehensive view of its obligations, exacts from the temporary Viceroy of India a devotion of time, thought, anxiety, and labour which it would be unreasonable to expect that the ablest man could persist in giving beyond the ternm of six or steven years usually allotted to that high office. Lord DALHousiE's deleg,ated Royalty has a'ready lasted more than eight years, and now Lord DmousrE retires, oppressed by fatigue, ill-health, anxiety, and almost, we may add, by the regrets of the subjects whom he quits. Our last Indian correspondence contains the address of the Calcutta deputation to the parting Governor, and his most touching reply. Few Indian Viceroyalties will bear comparison with that of Lord D uunousrz, if regard be had to the public transaetions by which it has been signalized. No Indian Viceroy within the last 60 years will bear comparison w-ith Lord DAIousm himself, if the personal energy and intervention of the man be considered. Vieweed by themselves the events of his rule are important; but when it is known how much their course was directed by him, how minute was his attention to the details of every plan, and how vigilant his supervision of their execution, the admiration which is always claimed for success becomes due to the energy and industry by which success was won, and a vague wonder warms mito a feeling of personal respect. It was this harclworking, unflagging energy, which earned for Lord DAumousrE the homage of all, even of his opponents, and it is this which now drives him, sickand worn, from the helm that he has so firmly grasped. It was Lord DAtOHuSIE'S object, as it was the wish of those who sent him out, to cultivate and perpetuate peace in that empire, which was beginning to breathe after a sanguinary struggle. But he soon discovered, as he told the gentlemen of Calcutta in his final speech, that "No prudent man, having any knowv" ledge of Eastern affairs, would ever venture to "predict a prolonged continuation of peace in " India." Scarcely had he been four months in the seat of supreme government when he was roused by the revolt of MooLRAJ into preparation for war. He himself marched for the North-West Provinces, and the vigour of his plans was attested by the desperate conflicts which ultimately sliattered the combination of the Sikhs. HIe followed up the crowning victory by a policy at once original and bold. He annexed the Punjab at once, indifferent to the unpopularity that such a measure might encounter. in the East, or the disapproval with which it might be visited in England. He then, by a felicitous plagiarism of the famous scheme of Lord CHiTHAZIX converted his bold but vanquished foes into trusty and hardy auxiliaries. But it was destined that one annexation should not suffice for the period of his authority. Berar, Pegu, Nagpore, and Oude have successively swellecd the area of our dominion and his responsibility. Neither courting war nor coveting territory, he has found himself adding province to province and people to people, proving by the bloodless and pacific acquisition of large States and populations that, wlhatever be the shortcomings of British rule or the paucity or indifference of British rulers, it and they are held by the native population in higlher respect and affection than the hereditary imbecilities raised from the soil. But, while he was a conqueror from necessity, and in spite of his previous determination, he was, from impulse and design, an ardent promoter of the arts of peace. The Sikhs sul.ued into alliance, Pegu, Nagpore, and Berar annexed, Oude annexed, railways opened, the electric telegraph permeating the length and breadth of the empire,-these are the monuments of Lord DxAousr's reign,-memorials, indeed, of his vigour and intellect, and also, we may hope, pledges and auguries of greater improvements and wider benefits to be conferred upon the Eastern subjects- of the British C1ROWN. It is the prerogative of greatness not only to tax itself by its own exhaustive efforts, but also to impose the prospective tax of emulation on posterity. It will be well forthose successors of Lord DAnousrE whose star does not pale under the blaze of his fame ;-it will be jbetter for those whose deeds and fortune will admit of their sharing with him the respect of England and the gratitude of India. We speak thus confidently of the reward which the ex-Governor-General has earned. In his case fortune and daring have proceeded with equal and concurrent step. He has lived to labour and to prosper in his labours, to plan wisely, act boldly, I and, even in the lifetime of his sway, to reap the hearty recognition of his services. But such prizes are not vwithout their drawbacks and their penalties. Hlear Lord DAHousiE's own truthful and touching language,- c31y only aTnbition long has been to accomplish the task w7hich lay before me here, and to bring it to a close withl honour ad success. It has been perniitted to me to do so. I have played out my part. And wLile I feel that, in my case, the principal act in the drama of my life is ended, I shall be weli content if the cnrtain should drop now upon my public course. Nearly 13 vears have passed away since first I entered the service of the Crown. Through all those years, with but one short interval, public employment of the heaviest responsibility and labour has been impo.ed upon me. I am wearied aud worn, and have no other thought or wish than to seek the retirement of which I stand in need, and which is all I now am fit for." To such men retirement may be a physical necessity. It is necessary to brace their nerves, to recruit their strength, and renew their health. But we trust that after a brief period of repose Lord DA=ousx will be able t6 earn by other services as useful, if not as brilliant as in his Indian administration, still further claims to the gratitude of his country.
If statesmen are warned to put no trust in Princes, they may be with equal justice cautioned against too confiding a dependence on popular assemblies. Last evening, when Sir J. WA3LMrSLEY was to ask leave to introduce his billU for the extension of the franchise and the improvement of the representation of England and Wales, there were not 40 members present at 4 o'clock. The House accordingly adjourned, and the scheme for a new Reform Bill is for the present year consigned to oblivion. In a House of Conimons which overthrew a Conservative Government and supports all that remains of the statesmen of 1832, there were not found 40 men who cared sufficiently for the great question of a quarter of a centiny back to give by their presence an opportunity for its discussion. But this apathy is by no means confined to the representatives of the people. The most ardent advocate of popular rights can hardly in the present case declaim against members as indifferent to subjects in which their constituents have a deep interest. In neglecting to make a " House," the Commons most truly represent those wvho sent them to Parliament. The great question of electoral reform is for the present entirely forgotten. It may be that war and its excitement have driven peaceable projects from the minds of borough politicians. The alternate triumphs and disasters of a sharply contested campaign, the alleged delinquencies of military chiefs, and the crash of a military system, are themes sufficient for the Englishman, who in politics, as in business and domestic life, is content to think on one subject at a time. It may be that the Eouse of Commons, however faulty in construction, has sufficiently answered the demands for progressive imnprovement, and the nation, finding that no abuse is denied a remedy, or at least a discussion, forgets to look closely at the theoretical defects of a system which is not inconsistent with good government. Whatever be the cause, the result is not doubtful. The people in this year of returning peace and cheering prospects care nothing about Parliamentary reform. Sir J. WAI-usLEY may be an honest and useful member of Parliament, but if a real Reform Bill were at hand it wonld certainly not be left to hii to introduce it. The debate, if not strangled in its birth, would have been only one of those annuals which politicians look on with different feelings according as individual comfort or public zeal predominates. To the majority of the House a motion of this kind gives hope of a pleasant holyday, while by the few who grieve over the delay of public business it is looked upon with something | approaching to impatience and anger. As to the wvorld out of doors, we doubt whether one Englishman in ten thousand knew that a bill for the reform of Parliament was to be brought forward on the 17th of April, or will feel either surprise or indignation that his representatives made their escape fiom the threatened debate. We are certainly not indifferent to the proper representation of the people, nor are we unmindful of the benefits which the great measure of 1832 conferred on the empire. All that has been done during the last two reigns-the reconstruction of our legal system, the freedom of our municipalities, the unfettering of our commerce, have been the results of the change which it cost so much time, toil, and statesmanship to effect. We have no wislh to use against fulther improvements the very arguments which fel from the lips of the Tolies of 1831. We doubt much whether a bad system can ever work well; nor do we believe in the vested ri-lits of electors, nor in the representa| tion of England being a representation of interests, and not of men. All that Sir J. WAmiSxy could have urged we, in common with the bulk of mankind, clearly see. Comparisons between Thetford and the Tower Hamlets, between Rutland and the West Riding, ara obvious to -every thin;ing man. Few persons have failed at some tiue to discuss the merits of triennial, Iquinquennial, and septennial Parliaments. Whether large constituencies are more or less subject to corruption than smal ones we have heard debated a hundred times, as well as the question whether bribery or intimidation be the greater ofil. The preponderance of what is called the gentry is an old subject, and we may debate whether a manufacturing country should have agricultural institutions. The riglit of Scotland to more than 53 members and of Ireland to more than 105 has been fully impressed on every one who has Scotch or Irish acquaintance. We may concede to Sir J. WA3ErsLEY that he would pro1 ably have had much the best of the argument. But the feeling, however illogical, is not the less irresistible, that the motion was il-timed, useless, and was received witlh an indifference with which the nation fully sympathizes. Probably there never was a time when people cared less than at present for Parliamentary reform, or believed less in its power to cure public ills. The last Reform Bill brought with it a Liberal Govemnment, a great change in political views, in party management, and oven in social habits. It was the close of one period and the beginning of another; like a deluge, it swept away an old world, which we shall never see again. Pensioners and sinecurists are pretty well extinct; criminal informations anrd arrests for sedition are things of the past. N"o such convulsion can ever occur again, for there is no accumulated mass of evil which stands in the way of public improvement. The favourite comparison of old Liberals -the Augean stable-is now only used with reference to the City Corporation, the Ecclesiastical Courts, or some such tottering relic of ihe past; it cannot longer be applied to the whole political system of this country. We cannot but feel that a new Reform Bill would be to the last what the revolutions of 1848 were to the great uprising of 1789. Men feel that there is no reason for manufacturing a 1olitical crisis, of which the benefits might not counterbalance the evils incurred in their attainment. There are at present matters enough to be arranged, and plenty of angry passions likely to be evoked in the settlement. Let us not add to the pressing difficulties of the hour any gratui- tous complications, or now, when party seems extinct, once more divide society into hostile camps, with the old cries and the old animosities. Three years since the leader of the Whig party rashly gave a pledge to introduce a bill of this kind. He perhaps did not feel that the 40 years of peace were coming to a close. In another year we had drifted into war, and the nation felt the absurdity of setting differences between the sections of the political world at a time when it was necessary that all should be united. It may be said that England is IIow at peace, and that the thread of reform should be talken up at the-point where it was left in lS53. But if peace be proc'aimed, we are still under the influence of the war that has closed. Such a fever does not leave the patient at once sound and strong for his ordinary avocations. Who can help feeling that the country, with its armies still in the field, with its expenses -still uncomputed and unprovided for, with its military system still in disorder, with the moral gains of the war yet to be realized, requires for the present a gentle and cautious treatment ? We still have allies, if not enemies; we still have a work to perform in Europe, territories to settle, military occupations to determine, races to regenerate if possible, nations to endow with somewhat of the prosperity which we ourselves enjoy. Such a time is most unfit for the opening of a domestic strife which would set every county and borough within the three kingdoms at variance.
No mad dog fears the vater more heartily than the ordinary run of Governments do a clear and consistent course. They have a perfect hydrophobia of principle. They care not what they do, provided only it be not clear, straightforward, and intelligi'Dle. They dislike running straight before the wind because it requires so little art and finesse, and are eternally tacking and veering, from a real honest preference for a crooked line to a straight one, or of two sides of a triangle to the third. Look, for instance, at the course of the last and present Government with regard to Ministers' Money, and say if it be possible to conceive any line of conduct less reducible to sound principle, or more calculated to disturb without remedying, and to irritate without preserving. The imposition or rate called "M l!iisters' "Money" was imposed by an act of the Irish Parliament on the householders of the city of Dublin and of seven other of the principal towns in Ireland for the support of the parochial clergy of the Established Church. Originally, no doubt, the burden fell principally on the Protestants, who were the chief inhabitants of the towns, but by degrees this incidence changed, and by far the greater burden fell upon the Roman Catholics, the vast increase of whose numbers placed the Protestants in a very small minority. Here was a case for a Liberal Government to deal -with on the clearest and most unquestionable principles. First, there was the general abstract doctrine that it is a manifest injustice and contrary to the spirit of modern legislation to compel one class of men to paY taxes for the purpose of supporting the religion of another class. Even if this ground be denied, there remains what appears to us the unanswerable argument derived from the relative positions of those who receive and those wVho pay. The recipients are endowed by law -with the revenues of a wealthy Chureh establishment, which they administer for the maintenance of a clergy possessing every attribute of a national Church, except parishioners to attend and congreg,ations to preacn to. The payers of this tax are principally the Roman Catholics, whose Church, while fruitful in children, is barren in substance, and whose ministrations, however eagerly sought, are poorly rewarded, because the wealthy Protestant establishment has engrossed to herself the funds which were once devoted to the maintenance and support of the religion of the Trs1i people. A stronger case, in point of justice, can hardly be imagined; but the policy was as clear as the justice. In the present state of Ireland it is not only wise statesmanship but the imperious duty of every Government to avoid occasions of strife and soothe the rankling wounds of faction and fanaticism which still grieve the land and divide its races and its energies. -What could be a more fruitful subject of discord than this periodical demand of a tribute, the badge of social inequality, superadded, by way of finish, to so long a catalogue of wrongs and grievances ? Here are reasons, as it seems to us, more than sufflicient to put the most phlegmatic Government in motion and to win the consent of the least liberal theorist. The result has contradicted ihose expectations. In 1854 Sir JoHN YouNxG, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, for the first time determinedto meddle with the question, and, instead of abolishing Ministers' MIoney altogether, sought to palliate the evil. The owners of houses under 101. were relieved from the payment of the tax, its collection was taken away from the clergy aud given to the municipal corporations, and the rate w-hich they were bound to collect was declared to be a debt due to the CROWx. The resullt has been what might have been expected from a measure of this complexion. The corporations, with much unanimity, refused to be tax-collectors for the clergy of another faith, and left the Government of the LoRD-LiEuTE&qAxT to levy the arrears as CRtowx clebts from eight of the most considerable towns in Ireland as best they could. Nor waas this resolution as magnanimous as it appeared to be. iMost of these corporations have no other property than their rates, -which are appropriated by act of Parliament to other purposes; and thus it seems extremely probable that the return to the process of execuition taken out against them by the Government will be " no effects." This was the position in which Ministers found themselves placed, and in it they had nothing to do but to choose a principle and boldly act upon it. If they were resolved to maintain the rights of the Protestant clergy and disregard the wrongs of the Roman Catholic laity they should have introduced an act to substitute for the unworkable machinery of Sir JoHxYouxG7'S bill a really: efficient agency for collection, armed with legal powers ample enough to secure the intended object. If this would have been neither just nor merciful, it would at any rate have been intelligible and consistent. If, on the other hand, true to their liberal professions, and acting in accordance -with the doctrines laid down by themselves, hi this very session, on the subject of Church-rates, they determined to give the relief to which the Roman Catholic; are so unquestionably entitled, their course wa3 eqrially clear ;-they should have repealed the impost altogether, and thus have obviated fha necessity of an unseemly conflict between the Government and the corporations. Eith.r course we could understand, but the Government of Ireland adopted neither of them. They professed, no doubt with perfect sincerity, the' greatest disliko and disapproval of the tax, and, having done so, they followed up this decision by defeating M1r. FAAzN's motion for its abolition, and declaring their intention of commencing a series of legal proceedings, which they admit will be utterly inoperative and ineffectual, announcing their intention at the same time, when. these abortive proceedings have come to an end, to reconsider the tax vith a view to its aboliti6n. They censure and disapprove the bill of Sir JoBx Y1OuNG, but continue to act under it. They agree in the justice of ir. FAGGAl's measure, but they procure its rejection. Ve are often told that Irish questions must not be look-ed at from a strictly English point of view, that we must make allowances for the difliculties which arise in that remarkable country, andnot push, in their application to the sister island, extreme doctrines to their extreme conclusions. But aU this is no excuse for creating difficulties, and every active inconsistency committed by a Government is a difficuilty, and a difficulty of the most embarrassing and least honourable description. MIankind wl acquiesce in nmuch hit grieves them if they thoroughly understand _ths rule under which they are governed, but pliancy without conciliation and inconsistency without adaptation to the exigencies of fie monient confer neither dignity nor popularity, and, while they embarrass immediate action, give but a poor promise of anythiing better for the future.
The Lower House of Convocation has set itself to worl; on a tasl; which defies even its well-knovn audacity of design and fertility of invention. While the LOBD CHANCELLOR and the oldest Bishops on the Bench have been labouring in vain to devise some decent and effectual mode of procedure for enforcing the discipline of the clergy, a committee of the Lower House of Convocation has come out -with a scheme of its own. As miay be expected, it is founded on the principle of reinstating the Bishop on the seat of justice which he is supposed to have lost, but qualifying his inexperience, his temper, his prejudices, his youth, his age-in a word, his usual notorious unfitness, with a copious application of aids and checks from other quarters, chiefly from the other dignities and ranks of the clerical profession. The Church Discipline Act, now " in force," was an attempt to combine the ministdrial and judicial functions, by letting the Bishop try his hand first and settle the affair before it went further. Even this he was not allowed to do without the aid of a commission. The proceeding has never had the least weight, and has been described as " savouring too much of an " actual trial without its safeguards or conclusion." It is now proposed, therefore, by the Lower Rouse of Convocation to substitute an actual trial. For this purpose they have evidently referred to the model of the Court-martial. Putting the Bishop of the diocess in the place of the SOV`EREIGY, they have composed a court of as many and as important materials as they could lay hands on. The machine, indeed, is immense, considering the very trifling affair, the very insignificant person, and the very out-of-theway place that would sometimes summon it into existence. Imagine a young clergyman fresh froin the University, of genial character, social habits, and not always able to command his temper, or even to control his thirst. Let him appear in public once or twice rather the worse for the 'squire's hospitality, or get into an altercation with a parishioner. Rere is the machinery it is proposed to set in motion against him:-The Bishop is to appoint a commission, consisting of the Vicar-General or Chancellor of the diocess, and a special Commissary, who should have practised as an advocate in Doctors'-coinmons not less than seven years, or as a barrister not less than ten years ; the Archdeacon; and not less than four beneficed clergymen, to be selected out of a panel of not less than twelve in each Archdeaconry, chosen by the clergy at the several places of the Archdeacon's visitation. This Court is to decide on the lavw and the facts of the case it is to sit as near as may be to the locality of the alleged offence; to send a report to the Bishop, with the evidence, and recommend a sentence, with adjudication of costs. It is then reserved to the Bishop to pass such sentence of admonition, censiure, suspension, deprivation, or deposition as the justice of the case should appear to him to demand. It is proposed that there shall be only one appeal, which in such a case as we have supposed would be to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Coincil, passing over the Archbishop's court, and attempting to repair that omission by providing that for the purpose of such appeal everyArchbishop or Bishop, or member of the Privy Council, should be also in the Judicial Committee. We will not go into the ampler tribunal and the more complex procedure provided for alleged offences against the doctrine of the Church or involving questions pertaining to ritual or divine service, because whatever remarks we have to make on the simple, vulgar case, wve have supposed, would apply wvith tenfold force to the more delicate cases of -disputed doctrine and rite. We have one tliing to say of the whole attempt to coinpose a judicial coUrt of Anglican ecclesiastics, whether Bishops, Archdeacons, Canons Residentiary, Canons Honorary, or Beneficed Clergymen. None of them have had any legal education, or one at all qualifying them for judicial functions. What is even more to the purpose, they have not gone through that life of discipline, that daily routine, that exact subordination, those formalities of office which qualify the members of a military or a naval Court-martial. Not ouily is it possible that any one member of the Comnmission here proposed, and even the Bishop himself who is to appoint them, and then confirm, aunml, or qualify their sentence, may have been put in his place simply because he was a man of family, or a rich man, or a Greek scholar, or a mathematician, or a man of science, or a good fellow, or a bad fellow, but the probability is the greater part of theni woould have come to their position by some such recommendations. Take the very unexceptionable case of a man made a Bishop because he was a popular preacher, of good family, and of amiable disposition. Is it fair to trust anybody's character and prospects, and, what is more, the personal discipline of the Church, to a judge with these official qualifications? WVe all know how men are made Bishops, and, to say the truth, we don't know a better way ; but they are not made for their legal and judicial qualities, nor is even fairness and imipartiality always required. Weknow, too, how Archdeacons and Canons are made,-as often as not on the mere ground of personal friendship or kin. We know, too, how beneficed clergymen are madesometimes at Colleges, sometimes at the Auctionmart. Putting aside the probabilities of the case, the poorest curate in the kingdom has a right to the assiirance of a better qualification for his judges; and a proper qualification is not to be obtained by ringing the changes on Bishops,Deans, Archdeacons, Canons, Prebendaries, Rectors, and the rest. Were the ministry of the Church of England at all like the naval and military services-were the clergy compelled to a routine, to the command of bodies of men, and to duties calling for continual self-command and discretion,-were they even accustomed to send in reports to their superiors,were they, in fact, obliged to do anything at all but live a certain proportion of the year in their parsonages, and read services on certain days and occasions, they might acquire, if not strictly judicial, at least business habits. But, with little to do requiring discretion, and indeed little of any lind-with little subordination, either to yield or to enforce, they are about the last men to be put, at the su3nmons of a Bishop, in the seat of a Judge. A man put on his trial in a matter affecting his life, his hoitour, his position, or his prospects, will lcok -with a jealous and scrutinizing eye on his judges. Even if he mnust admit the fact charged against him, still he knows also that the measure of the fact, and the proportion of his error, as compared with those of others, will depend on the discretion and candour of his judges. Re will expect the spotless ermine of unquestionable character ancd qualification, - whether in the Lord Chancellor, or the Jndge of Assize, or the Court-martial, or the Judge in- Doctors'commons. He will not willingly submit to anuihilation at the hands of any chance person, possibly of no weigalt, and not wholly irTeproachable. Even to take the vulgar instance -with which we began,-the young clergyman-who has been drinking too much with one squire, and had a wrangle with

CONV-ENrTION OF ScoT-ITsH BUVGHS.-The annual convention of commissioners representing the Royal burghs of Scotland assembled at Edinburgh on Tuesday last. About 50 burghs were represented. In the absence of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh the Provost of Stirling 'was -called to the chair. The junior Commissioner for Edinburgh (Mr. Dickson) proposed that the Convention should memorsalize Her Majesty in favour of the appointment of a Secretary of State for Scotland, in the same terms as formerly. Nothing, he said, would be done till the people of Scoland showed themselves in earnest by continuing to persevere in this application. Professor Aytoun (Assessor for Qucensferry), seconded the motion. He said he believed that, had there been a Secretary of State for Scotland to make himself acnuainted with the feelings of the people of this country, and who occupied such a position in the Government as would have enabled him to bring matters connected with Scotland officially before the Government, it would not have suffered the defeat it lately met -with on the blfletingquestion. The motionwas agreed to. Onthe motion of MajorS cott (representing.Selkirk), it wvasnanimnously ,greed to petition the Hoiuse of Commons to give practical cffect to its late resolution on the subject of the billeting of coldiers- The Provost of Stirling proposed that a vote of thanks should be tendered to Mr. CoNvan and other Scotch members of Parliament who had attended to the interests of the burghs in this matter, which was agreed to. The Convention then agreed,by 29 to 16, to memorialize Government to proceed with the coast defences recently commenced on the east and north of Scotland. TheAssessor for Lanark (Mr. Duncan M'Laren) then moved the approval of the Lord Advocate's bill for the planting of new schools in burghs in Scotland, and for the levying an education rate not exceeding Id. per pound for their support; which motion -was unanimouslycarried. The Convention resolved to present an address of congratulation toHerMajestyontho restoration of peace. The Convention then adjourned till Wednesday, when the first business taken up was the Lord-Advocate's 'iUl to increase the salaries of parish schoolmasters and to remove the tests limiting the cloice of teachers to members -of the established church. 3Ir. 3'Laren moved the general approval of the bill. The Assessor for Xilrenny moved as an amendment, that the bill be approved, excepting the clauses relating to the removal of the tests. The motion was carried by 30 to 9. It 'was unanimously agreed to petition in favour of the English system of registration of Parliamentary voters being extended to Scotland in place of the present mode of registering through party organization. It was resolved to petstion against the vwithdrawal of the present Parliamentary grants for the encouragement of the fisheries in Scotland and against the abolition of the Eishery Board. It was agreed to petition for the stationin,r of ships of war in the firths of Forth, Tay, and Clyde, and 2,lorayFrlib. Itvwas remitted to the annual committee to -atch over the Local Shipping Dues Bill, whicls it was held would injuriously affect the interests of Edinburgh and other places. It was agreed to petition for the reduction of the dunty on fire insurance from 3s. per iOZ. to Is. After some other business the Gcnvention adjourned till April, 1857. PNrO3fRNTD TO Jonr WEsL.-At a public meeting held at Epwortb, the principal town in the Isle of Axholme, North Lincohlshire, and the birth-place of John Wesley, the founder of the sect of Wesleyan Methodists, it was unanimously resolved-" That a statue, in accordance with a design submitted to the meeting by Mr. Henry Xilbury, artist, Doncaster, be erected in some convenient place in the town of Epworth, the birth-place of the late -John Wesley; the requisite fund to be raised by a national penny subscription. A committee was formed, with Mr. as. Dunn, M.., of Doncaster, at the head, for the purpose f caryi out the object of the meeting; and, in furtherance of the foregoing resolution, a lithograph of the intended monument was ordered to be prepared, and arrangements were made to facilitate the collection of subscriptions liy duly authorized agent-s.

FORBIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE CLOSING OF THE CONGRESS. [A portion of the following Appeared in our second edition of yesterdav :-1 (BY SUDmuRL A)D PRntSH TOGBAPiH.) We have received the following telegraphic depatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, THURSDiY, APBE 17, 8 A.M. "The Moniteur announces that the Congress of Paris has terminated its labours. " The closing sitting was held yesterday at the hotel of the Mtinister for Foreign Aiairs. "After the signing of the treaty, the Plenipotentiaries had still to occupy themselves with different questions of a nature to consolidate and complete the work of peace. " The ratifications will be exchanged at the end of the month. " Immediately after the promulgation of the general treaty the protocols will be published, and will make known the labours of the Congress in their detail."
(}!0Ow OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS, WEDNESD.Y, A2RiL 16,6 p.. The Congress met to-day for the last time. Three of the Plenipotentiaries will leave Paris on Friday or Saturday-namely, Baron Mfanteuffel, Count Buol, and Lord Clarendon. They will probably have their audiences of leave to-morrow. As the time is fast approaching for the arrival of the ratifications of peace from Constantinople, and the publication of the protocols, it is, perhaps, more prudent to hazard as few conjectures as possible about them; but, notwithstanding the repeated denials about the Italiani question having been treated in the Congress, it is now beyond doubt that it has been treated, and at some length, though it is certain that but little of what passed will be foiund in those documents. Indeed, I should not be surprised if the subject were despatched very briefly. It will, perhaps, be said that while the Congress has taken into consideration the condition of certain of the Italian States, and while it adkmits the necessity of reform, yet having no special mission on the subject it adopts no resolution on it. Even if this version be correct -and I by no means guarantee it, it does not follow tbat strong remonstrances will not be addressed to the King of Nfaples and the Pope. If these remonstrances are without effect, the Italian people may take the matter into their owvn hands. Be this as it may, I repeat that much has been said about Italy in the Congress of which the protocols will make no mention. A person who professes to be well acquainted with the Court of Berlin, writes to the following effect, under date the 10th "Do you really believe that a few scandalous and san. guinary incidents are only passing here ? You are in error if you do so. I know the country well, and I can clearly see the plague spots which are spreading gradually, but surely, over the whole body politic. I find it dificult to explain to myself the sort of indifference which exists in France and England on what passes. France (it is a German who writes) may well rejoice at it, for Prussia cherishes undying rancour against her, and the Rhenish provinces were only given her in order to perpetuate it. But England has two powerful reasons to interest herself in the future of Prussia. One is, as you are aware, recent. The eldest daughter of Queen Victoria is destined to be one day Queen of Prussia, if Heaven sparesher life. But what is of still greater interest to England is that Prussia is the only nation on the Continent which, as Protestant and possessing a constitutional Governmnent, offers an alliance to England amid the hatreds which have been on aU sides excited against her. The petty Protestant States offer her no resovrces-iot even Saxony; for if the Saxons are Protestants their Sovereign is Ca. tholic. If it be true that such is Prussia-if it be true that she plays such a part in th& equilibriumn of Europe that, at the commencement of the conflict which the treaty of peace has just terminated, she could by a single word ad. dressed to Russia have saved treasures and armies buried in the Crimea-what ncw passes here is very grave indeed. You may rely upon it the King is engaged in an implacable warfare with his o.vn bro-her, and the efforts made to keep up appearances to the contrary, only convince those who are in the secret of the depth of their hatred. The noblesse in its feudal frenzy dreams of nothing but the rgisghc of the sword and of t'it bludgeon; the restoration of their seignorial rights, pit and gallows included, in the provinces, and in the capital outrage and insult. In the meantime the people coalesce with the middle classes, and, all of them having served in the Landwehr, they receive from the members of colleges and of the liberal professions counsels the more formidable that they are justified, and provoked by necessity. To complete the general confusion, the great Ceplfoyis are constantly at loggerheads; they insult each other without taking the trouble to conceal their quarrels. " Al that occurs is attributable to the K-ing, wvho alternately encourages to extreme measures the liberals and the aristocracy. He abounds in theory, and ever pushes it to its extreme limit, and exhausts either system by turns. You are surprised, Isuppose, when you learn that a favosuite counselor perishes by his own hand; when another, seeking in vain the protection of his honour in the authority of the Sovereign, finds no other resource than in the open violation of the primary rules which govern the magistracy, and, unable to live dishonoured, flings himself on death. Then you have the King foHowing his funeral, and weeping for him whose life and dignity in the State he hesitated to save. Does all this really astonish you? But such things will henceforth become more formidable, and more frequent. Who does not Inow, for instance, thatthisworthy Seigneur, this perfectly honest man, Count de Maltzan, Minister for Foreign tffairs, died mad ? He had a successor whose ability, whose fine intellect, and whose attentive manners were known and appreciated by Elurope. That Minister, who wvas a soldier as well as a writer, could nlot long survive the petty but implacable warfare waged against him. The history of the career of MI. de B., one of the rivals whom theKing constantlyopposed to him in aU his opinions and in all his plans, is quite characteristic of the Monarch. 'When hiis Mlafjesty was Prince Royal, while he was stiU enlthusiastic for abstruse science and hollow philosophy, he paid avisit to Rome, whence he brouight back the Catholic branch which he subsequently tried to engraft on the stemi of Protestantism; the branch soon decayed becauise it was too old, and the tree too young. Oil his arrival at Rome the King sought a cicerone to guide him, and he was given the renowvned historian of Rome, Niebulbr. They went together to Mount Aventine, and then the pedant Prince asked his guide for explanations of all he saw around him. fiebulhr, as unyielding as the Fates themselves, cut short the thread of the Prince's discourse, and proved to his Royal Highness that lie was utterly in error. The Prince returned in a rage to the Prussian Embassy and demanded for the following day M. de B., another, but less eminent, antiquarian, attached to the Prussian mission, inorder to continue his researches. This sarant, who was a better courtier than the other, made a complete conquest of the Prince, who as soon as he mounted the throne drew him from his Carferlai7res and his Palimpsestes, and transformed him into a statesman. He rose to the summit; but soon shared the fate of all who have had the misfortune to be the Kinges favourites-he fell. Believe me, we are all falling '2' I venture to make a remark or two on the preceding letter, which very pro&,ably presents a faithful description of the internal state of Prussia. I am aware that an attempt will be made, and, perhaps, is now makingR, in Prusssia and elsewhere to induce forgetfulness and pardonfor the shortcomings of that Government, to damagetheFrenchalliance with this country, and to substitute for it that of Prussia. Yet it is doubtful whether a similar theology and similar political institultions will be accepted in satisfaction for bad faith. It is very well to speak of Prussia's influence at St. Petersburg, and to saythat a single word from Berlin could have prevented the war. If so, why was not that word spoken? Why, when war was raging, did not the nighty magician wave his wand and stay the tempest? Was the philosophic King of Prussia so absorbed in theory as to have no thought of humanity ? The modern history of Prussia offers little to recommend her as an ally to any nation. She has been perfidious to friend and foe alike, and has not hesitated to accept from the hand of the common enemv the spoils of her own allies. While accepting the subsidies of England, she proposed, after the victory of Austerlitz, a treaty, of 'which the basis was the annexing Hanover to the Prussian dominions. Her perfidy to her friend, her servility to her enemy, and her rapacity towards all, did not even secure her the confidence of him to gain whose favonr she was ready to descend to the lowest point of degradation. "From the moment," says Bignon, "that the Treaty of the 16th of February (1806) was signed, Napoleon did more thanhate Prussia-he conceived for her the most profound contempt. Allhis views from that day were based on considerations foreign to her alliance; he conceived new projects and formed new plans as if that alliance no longer existed." The conduct of Prussia during the crisis of the last three years, which for the present is terminated, does not qualify her to be the ally of any Power. The Patrie announces that the Frencl corvette Duichayla, commanded by Rear-Admixal JTu i=n lo Ia Graviere, is to attend at the grand naval review which the Queen of England is to hold at Spithead onthe .26th inst. Among the other officers and persons appointed to accompany the Rear-Admiral are-Captain de Belveze, Lieutenant Zed, who was dangerously wounded on the Ville de Paris, by the aide of Admiral Hamelin ; M. Hamelin, jun., AideI de-Camp of the Minister of l-arine; M3. Buquet, Under-Chief of the personwel of the Naval Departi ment; and A. Durand Brager, a painter, who lately returned from the Crimea, where he remained attached to the squadron since the beginning of the war. The Duchayla is toleave Cherbourg on Saturday or Sunday morning. The Marseilles journals of the 15th inst. bring accounts from Constantinople of the 3d, and from the Crimea of tho 1st inst. The French naval administration, in the Tiukish capital, was already making preparations to convey part of the army to France. The garrison of Eupatoria is to bethe first embarked. The commercial intelligence from Eu- patoria was truly deplorable. The cosmopolite | merchants established there had no other resource left than to ship their stock for Odessa. The news of the conclusion of peace had produced a favourablea influence on tEe rate of the currency, which had declined 5 per cent. General ILirchey wvas to resign, on the 4th, the chief commtand of the French troops at Constantinople and in the Bosphorus. On the 3d the General took leave of the Sulltan, and was to be succeeded in his command by General Pariset. General Williams is to form part of the commission which is to fix the Asiatic boundary. Abbd Fraissignes, a Lazarist, chaplain to the French military school hospital, died of typhus fever on the 30th ult. Another clergyman of that order and a sister of charity, both attached to the Sardinian Contingent in the Crimea; had likewise died. The number of nuns of St. Vincent of Paul who perished since the beginning of the war was 24, and many were still lying dangerously ill. The municipal council of Marseilles had resoived to offer a banquet to Marshal Pelissier, who is expected there towavrds the close of the mnonth.

The return of the Prince of Prussia to Berlin, which had been originally fixed for Sunday last, is postponed till next Saturday. His stay on the Rhine has been prolonged by his desire himself to install General von Bonin, the former Mlinister of War, in his newv office of Vice-Governor of the federal fortress of M;layence. On Saturday evening last all the regimental bands of the garrison performed a serenade in his honour before his hoteL On Sunday he was presented to the entire body of troops drawrn up on the Schloss-platz, which was followed by a dinner, at which all the highest civil and mnilitary authorities were present. Some of the Berliners are looking forward with great expectations to a -visit from the Emperor of Russia, whio, as they expect, will accompany his mother hither; and not content with this, they have fixed upon Berlin as the spot to which several different Sovereigns wrillresort for the purpose of paying him their respects. The talk that there was some little time back of a further Russian loan for 100,000,000 roubles, has died away ; it turns out to have been caused by some recent inquiries made in Amsterdam, previous to the signing of the peace with a view to the possible contingencies of the war being prolonged. The wlhole of the last Stieglitz Five per Cent. Loan has not been disposed of yet, so that the Russian Government would not gain much by bringing out another in a hurry. A. report has also been current here, with much less foundation, that a crgdit moybilier was on the tapis to be opened in St. Petersburg by English capital as soon as the peace is established. If any such scheme is on foot in the city it will be safe to pronounce it as got up for the benefit of the " stags" of Bartholomew-lane. Any one who knows Russia must be aware that that Government would never permit any private company to acquire the influence that would be inseparable from the wielding of large capital there; nor does the country stand in need of such help; though the Government is poor the population is rich in ready money. If the Government take the proper steps to inspire its subjects with confidence in any undertaking the capital can be foind in the country; if not, the State borrows money abroad at 5 per cent. per Stieglitz, and then makes a clear profit on the ordinary rate of interest, which is pretty steadily 8 per cent. in Russia. There are higher grounds, however, for believing that an application has been made to the Russian Government, among oihers by a house here, for permission to erect a cre'dit vnobilier at Warsaw, but with what success I have not heard. Prince Chreptowitsch, Russian Minister at Brussels, is here just now on his way back to Russia, where he proposes to reside a short time on his estates. Prince Galitzin and Baron von Berg Secrgtaire de leationg, are also here from St. Petersburg. That which Russia stands most in need of is skilled laboiur; this article, more particularly in connexion with machinery, steam engines, and manufactures, was, up to the breaking out of the war, supplied by Englishmen. Such of our countrymen as were under contract in Russia at the breaking out of the war were not permitted to return, although their continuing to work for the enemy was pronounced by the Queen in Council to be treason. The authorities gave the English workmen in St. Petersburg to understand that they were vigilantly watched, and that any attempt to leave their work or the country would be punished by, being conveyed into the interior. All fresh supplies of skilled labour since the breaking ouit of the war have been derived from Prussia; physicians, mechanics, engineers, smiths, &c., find berths there very readily; but, nevertheless, it was not till last December that the Russian Government thought proper, in consequence of repeated representations on the part of this Government, to put Prussian subjects on the same footing as other nations with regard to the facilities of visitmig E[oly Russia. On the 2d of December last year the Preussische Corraespondenz published the news of the facilities at length conceded to Prussian subjects in visiting Russian Poland; and, on the 11th of February this year, the Minister of the Interior made known that the same facilities were extended to the traffic with Russia Proper as had already been afforded with reference to Russian Poland. Those facilities consist in the permission to Prussians who live within 21 versts of the Russian frontier to cross over without any other than a Prussian passport backed by all sorts of testimonials as to good character and conduct, &c., and Russian Embassies and Consulatesarepermitted to affix their visA to the passports of Prussian subjects " not unfavourably knowvn to them" without previous inquiry in St. Petersburg, &c. At the same time, the Minister publishes a caution that all those who have not obtained a fixeed employment beforehand will not find it judicious to visit Russia on speculation unless they are in possession of very ample means of subsistence; the chance is very smal of their finding sitnations when there, the result of the experience hitherto obtained being that they generally come to bitter, want. The Russian Embassy here also makes known tnat no application for employment addressed direct to the Emperor or to any of the authorities in Russia can meet with any attention; they must all be made through the Russian Embassies, postpaid, and be accompanied with the necessary certificates of good behaviour, & c. These papers consist, in all probability, of certificates of birth, baptism, of having had the smallpox, of never having been in the clutches of the police for any offence, of excellent conduct from the curator of the applicant's soul (Seelensoayger)-that is to say, the clergyman to whose district he belougs. Simonides bids fair to become a Wandering Greek, aspend ant to the Wandering Jew; he is aow expelled from Vienna, and the route of lIis coercive passport is visi for Syra.

The Blac&wall, Captain Thorn, belonging to Mr. Green, of London, has arrived in. the Channel, and was 70 miles S.W. of the Lizard at 10 o'clock a.m. on Monday evening, when she placed 21 passengers, chiefly Comish men, in a Scilly pilot boat, which landed them at Penzance on Tuesday afternoon. The Blacl-wall left Melbourne on the 28th of December, and, after touching at Pernambuco, crossed the line on the 23d of Masach, since which fine weather has been experienced. She has a full cargo, chiefly wool, and is said to bring beween three and four tons of gold-dust and upwards of 200 passengers, many of whom have pareels of gold-' dust. Among the first-class passengers are several successful Scotchmen returning with their families. It was Captain Thorn's intention to land the mail, containing about 2,000 letters, at Plymouth.
IRBLAND. (FR0w OUR OWN0 CORESPOasDEWT I DUBI3, THURSDAY MORNsG. MAYWoOTHE. The result of Mr. Spooner's annu31 spring assault upon the Maaynooth endowment has created some surprise here, and the effect will doubtless be an attempt, probably successful, to stir up the smouldering embers of agitation in the form of a counter attack upon the Irish branch of the established church. The heaa to conduct such a campaign has yet to be found; nevertheless, the professional disturbers of peace are quite sanguine of -an early flush of business, and have no fears whatever of the trade being checked for the want of a competent leading partner. It now only remaias to be seen whether the policy inaugurated at Sligo, Nev Ross, and Athione, will be foLlowed up in the event of a general election, and whetlher Dr. M'Hale and his turbulent adrairers, lay and clerical, will further strengthen the hands of that party in the house of Commons of which the hon. member for WVarwickshire is the exponent. THE nAHDCeoK ESTATES. The case of " Delacour v. Handcock" was again brought under notice yesterday in the Court of Chancery, in a cause petition or petitions, which were originally set down under the 15th section of the Chancery Regulation Act last term, as ordinary administration suits, but were ordered to staud in the general list under the peculiar circumstances that they arose out of the celebrated case of " Delacour v. IHandcock," which was heard by his Lordship in Hilary Term, 1855, and which, it will be recollected, resulted in a compromise, by which the defendant, Mr. John Stratford Handcock, was to get the estates in dispute, and the petitioner a sum of 20,0001. in case he should attain his majority, and the interest onthatsumintheinterim. The petitions, it appeared, were filed by some of the next of kin of the late Miss Honoria Handeock, to admnidster her assets, and the case relied on was, that the compromise entered into, and before referred to, and which had been made the subject of an act of Parliament, did not and could not affect their interests, and that they were entitled to considerable portions of the property of the deceased. It is, of course, unnecessary to go into a detail of the facts of this very remarkable cause, which were reported at great length in the original suit. The Court was all day engaged in hearing the arguments of counsel upon some preliminary point raised, and will this day go in detail into the facts. THE TIPPERARY BANE.

MEBVIXA OIF CONYOCATIOX. Both Houses of Convocation reassembled yesterday. THE UPPEP. HOUSE. Their Lordships met in the Bounty-office, under the presidency of his Grace the Primate. There were also present-the Bishops of Oxford. Tincoln, St. Asaph, Worcester, Salisbury, Ilandaff, Norwich, Winchester, and St. David's. Several petitions were presented, -when their lordships adjouned till 2 o'clock. Upon the Hlouse reassembling at that hour, The President sent Mr. F. Xnivett, the spparitor, to the Lower House, to inquire whether they had come to any resolution on the report. The Prolocutor, accompanied by the Very Rev. Dr. Peel, Dean of Worcester, the Venerable the Archieacon of St. Albans, the Archdeacon of Bristol, the Rev. Canon Selwyn, theRev. Mr. Massingbred, the Dean of Norwich, and the Archdeacon of Maidstone, as his Assessors, arrived. The PsoLoCUuTOR, addressing his Grace, said-I am desired, your Grace, to place in your hands the report of the committee on the laws affecting the discipline of the church, as amended by the Lower House. I am also desired to inform your Grace that the members of the Lower House have desired me to appoint a committee to assist me in framing a report on the amended document. I beg now to place in your Grace's hands the document as amended. The Archbishop of C_xN-TmBuY said,-I will lay the matter before this House, and after it has been discussed you 'will hear from me again. The Prolocutor and the Assessors then retired. The report, as brou"ht up was read by Mr. Dyke, the Registrar-General of the province, and after a short discussion their lordsbips adjourned. THE LOWERt HOUSE. Yesterday morning, at 10 o'clock, the Lower House of Convocation reassembled in the Jerusalem Chamber, the Dean of Ely, the Prolocator, again presiding, and resumed the consideration of the report of the Committee of the -HEouse on the state of the law affecting the discipline of the clergy. THE FNAL APPEAL IN ATT1ES Op DocTRTh'1I. The Archdeacon of Bmn-sismE submitted that it was exceedingly desirable that the House should arrive, if possible, at some conclusion on the subject of the court of final appeal in matters of doctrine. The question, he admitted, was surrounded with difficulties which were inherent to it. The church of England, so far as it was connected with the State, was an organization within the State, andmust therefore, to a certain extent, be overruled by the constitution of the State. With regard to its spiritual constitution and its higher essences, it was part of a far wider organization, which- was bound by no country and no kind, the laws of whichwere so established that nohuman adjudicature could in the least touch them. The House had to recognizeand, if possible, to reconcile-thoso two elements, complete in themselves, but conflicting in their practical operation. He wanted to have every question of this kind fairly handled by the spiritual element acting by itself ; in other words, to keep the temporal and spiritual discussion separate. With that view he moved- " That in all causes involving questions of doctrine or ritual the fmnal appeal should be to Her Majesty in Council, and should be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; provided that no person, not being a member of the united church of England and Ireland, should be com- etent to sit in such committee for the trial of such appeal. That the Judicial Committee should frame and transmit to the Archbishop of Canterbury a question asto what was the doctrine or rule of the church of England on the point which might happen to be in dispute; and the archbishop should thenceforth sunmmon a meeting of aU the bishops of both the English provinces; and the bishops of so many of them as should be assembled under such summons should cause the question to be argued before them, aud should, after such ar"ument, report their opinion on the question to the Judicial Committee, who should then, after consideration of such opinion, proceed to such final determination of the cause as to them might seem proper." The Rev. Canon HussEY seconded the motion, which appeared to him the most desirable and practicil way of settling this difficult question. It was, besides, not adverse to the prerogative of the Crown, not inconsistent with the principles of the church, and it was quite in accordance wvith what had been done in former times. The Rev. Canon WOODGATE supported the motion, which he believed was the.onlyplain, practical, andcommon sense way of settling questions of this kind, in that it recognized at once the supreme power of the State and the spiritual element. Archdeacon DE=sox objected to the assertion of any principle at this moment as to the constitution of the court of appeaL He thought under the circumstances under which the church of England was placed, when it was a plain and notorious fact that it would be erxtremely difficult to procare the assent of the chief authority in the State to the synodical action of the church, it became the House to be careful how they constituted a Court, the decisions of which, from the ecclesiastical character with vhich it was proposed to invest it, would carry with them a degree of weight which did not belong to the decisions of the Court as at present constituted. He saw a difficulty in uniting Presbyters to such a Court, because he did not see on w;hat principle the selection should be made. He thought also that it was contrary to all principle and al ri.ght that the civil power should be altogether excluded. The very question of an establishment at once brought in the civil power as the guardian of the temnoralities. All that he wanted to see was that the reference ihould be of a proper kind, that it should not be made to one portion of the Ecclesiastical Synod only, but to the whole Siynod. Archdeacon GRA4N-T moved an amendment to the effect, that the motion of the Archdeacon of Berkshire demanded serious consideration, andlonger deliberation than theHouse could safely give it sithin the short time to which their session wras now limited. IMr. Chancellor MBTLN. seconded the amendment, because he believed the motion of tho Archdeacon of Berkshire, if adopted,might every now andthen place the Church andthe Stateina most lamentable state of coJlion. It sought to organize a new mode of procedure, which somepeople would almost regard astantamountto aseparationof Church and State. The amendment was put and carried. The House then proceeded to discuss and settle the remaining clauses of the report, most of which related to the medes of proceeding in causes not involving questions of doctrine, and which, as involving matters of detail, had, comparatively, little public interest. The report in its1 entirety, as amended and adopted by the House, is intended to form the groundwork of a measure to be brought beforo Parliament, by which, it is hoped by the House, to use the concluding words of the report, " the authority of the church wvould he exercised, and its discipline enforced, in a manner less costly, less dilatory, and more effectual than by the course and forms of proceeding prescribed by the existing law." On the motion of Mr. Canon SELwYN, an omission in the report was cured so as to include the province of York, as 'well as that of Canterbury, in the proposed measure. On the motion of Mr. Archdeacon DESisoN, seconded by the Rev. 3Mr. JOYCE, the Prolocutor was requested by this House to undertake ,with such assitance as he might call for from the members of the committee, the task of digesting and preparing for presentation to his Grace the President and their lordships of the Upper House, the report on the discipline of the clergy, as amended and adopted by this House. The Archdeacon of lArDsToN E moved, that the following be the preamble to the resolutions proposed by him on the preceding day and agreed to by the House, declaratory of the principles to be kept in view in regard to final appeals - "In approaching the subject of the due adjustment of the course of final appeals in questions of doctrine, the House felt that they were entering upon the most grave and important of the matters referred to their consideration, on which they were required to combine full security for the doctrine and discipline of the church, vith the maintenance at the same time of the supremacy of the Crown, as the ultimate source of justice or redress to every subject complaining of wrong, whether in matters ecclesiastical or cviL" The Rev. Canon WoRDs,yoRTH moved as an amendment,- " That with the view to connect ourselves withibe church in primitive times, and showing that the Reformation was not innovating but restorative, and that in fact, instead of originating any new principles, it adopted a primitive princi Ye transmitted from the earliest times, in the judgment o this Hlouse the principles to be kept in view in regard to final appeal are those which we have inherited from primitive times, and which were fully and carefully embodied, at the time of the Reformation, in the preamble to the Statute of Appeals." He said, what he wanted to show wa, that the church of England wvas not in an insular position, but in harmony with the whole of Christendom from primitive times, and that they w ere doing nothing which was at all peculiar to themselves, but that they were bringing foreard, or rather restoring, principles which were common to them and the whole Roman empire. What he wrould entreat the House to consider wras that thev wvished to bring out, not the principle merely that this was a legitimate sequence from thepractice of the church of this realm, but from the practice of the church and the whole Roman empire. He thought they strengthened their position exceedin'ly when they enlarged the basis to which they had hitherto teen confined. He protested against the charge alleged againstthem, that theywere, bothphysicallyandeccleiastcally, an insularatomnasitwore, separated andexcluded from communionwiththerestof Christendom, and that they were historically and spiritually so; and he wished to show that, so far from that being the case, they hAd adopted a principle inherited not merely from Englishmen, but from the beginning of the church catholic. (Cheers.) The amendment was withdrawn on a suggestion that it was irregolar or inconvenient, and the motion of the Archdeacon of Maidstone was agreed to. The PRoLocUToR, accompanied by his assessors, then proceeded to the Upper House, in compliance with a sammons from their lordships, and informed them that ths- had completed the consideration of the report, and that hg (the Prolocutor)'would, with the assistance of the comniAtt.e, undertake the task of digesting d preparing it foz i sentation to their Iordships.

HORRIBLE ASSAESrArATION in BREW-R- STIIEET. One of the most daring acts of assassination ever ptrpetratedin this country occurred last night, shortly after S o'clock-, in Ruperb-street, 1aymarket. One man has been so seriously ijlured that in all prohability he has already ceased to live, and three other persons are dangerously wounded. The assassin is an Italian, named Foschini; and, unhappily, in the confusion which arose at the moment he commnitted his diabolical crime, he effected his escape, and up to the present moment has evaded the most active search of the police officers. The scene of the tragedy is an Italian and French restaurant, k;ept by a native of the Papal States named Ioouis Stuechi, at 45, Rupert-street, Haymarket. This person is at present in the country,_ and the crime, wvhich will give to his house a terrible notoriety, will therefore be first communicated to him through the newspapers. Among the foreigners who were accustomed to assemble at Stucchi's restaurant were Francesco Rossi, Carlo De Rn.dio, and Pietro Chiesa, all natives of the same part of Italy. The assassin Foschini has been a visitor only during a comparatively recent period, but from his family and connexions having been mnown to Rossi and the other Italians, he had been admitted into their society, and frequently passod his evenings in Rupert-street. At about a quarter past S o'clock last evening Rossi, Chiesa, and Da Itudio were conversing together in the back room on the ground floor, on cursory subjects, when Foschini entered, and, producing a pack of cards, suggested that the whole party should play a game together. Rossi objected, and sssigned as a reason that he wished to go home early, upon which Foschini repeated his request, and volunteered to fetch some beer from a neighbouring publichouse as an inducement to keep the party togeiher. He did so, and on re-entering the restaurant offered Rossi and the others the free use of the beverage he had furnished. Something was said as to the bad quality of the beer, and Foschini went out to exchange it, returning presently afterwards, and again joiing his companions in drinking. There was a fifth Italian present at this time- Carlo Rouelli, a man of education and birth, but reduced by circumstances to act as waiter at Stuchi's restaurant. In X short time after Foschini had rejoined the party, and before any game of cards had been comnmenced, Foschini complained of feeling ill, and requested that one of the party would assist him to the shop of a medical man. Possi, anxious to go home, volunteered to do so, and resting uponhis arm, apparently in a state of suffering, Foschini left the house and proceeded up Rupert-street, Rossi's intention being to conduct him to the nearest chymist's shop They had arrived at the corner of Richmond-street, oppo. site to Brettell's printing-office, Rossi raUying Foschini, and endeavouring to persuade him that he was not so ill as he affectedtobe, whentheformer,releasinghis armfromposchini's grasp, accidentaUy touched vith his hand a hard substance withinthe trousers of the latter, whichheat onceknew tube a poniard or stiletto. Rossi immediately charged him with the possession of the weapon, and ask-ed him vhat he meant. Foschini made no reply, but at once seeemec to have recovered his strength, and with Rossi retra:ed his steps to the restaurant. Rossi had, it appears, some mnowledge of Fosehini's desperate character, and from his sullen manner on being questioned he felt somewhat alarmed. On reaching Stucchi's house Rossi was in the act of placing his hand upon the door-handle, for the purpose of entering, -when Foschini, who was folowing closelv behind, struck him a violent blow over the shoulder with his poniard. This blow fortunately took only a slight effect, having been stopped by one of the upper ribs. Rossi instantly exclaimed, "What are you doing, assassin7" But before he had time to recover himself he received another blow on the arm, and retreating into the house, he -was followed by Foschini, -who continuea to strike at him with his poniard. Chiesa, De Rudio, and the waiter Rouelli were in the front saloon on the ground floor wvhen this attack took place, and on discovering Rossi retreating from the assassin they ran to his assistance. Foschini then dealt his deadly blows against all present. Rossi, faint from loss of blood, rnshed into the street, and, calling aloud for help, hastened to the nearest surgeon's, where his wounds were dressed, and from there he was conveyed to Charing-cross Hospital. As soon as Rossi left the house Foschini turned off the gas, and then in comparative darkness continued his murderous attack. Ronelli, the waiter, who had been foremost in endeavouring to seize the assassin, fell first, dangerously wounded in the head and abdomen, and. indeed, in all parts of the body. De Rudio next succumbed, and Chiesa alone remained to grapple with the assassin, when Foschini, finding, it is supposed, bis strength failing, retreated into the street, followei by Chiesa. On finding himself pressed, the assassin turned again upon Chiesa, and struck him a severe blow in the abdomen, from the effects of vhich Chiesa fell, still retaining strength, however, to call upon the bystanders, of whom nearly 20 were at hand, to arrest the assassin. The sight of the lpoiiard and the determined appearance of Foschini, however, seemed to strike a panic among them, and the assassin was actualy allowved to escape vithout molestation, no police constables being up to this time at hand. As soon as the restaurant was entered a dreadful sight presented itself. Rouelli, apparently in a dying state, was stretched upon the floor, blood flowing freely from wounds in every part of his body, and De Rudio was in a fainting state, also from loss of blood. Assistance was at once procured, and all the injured persons were conveyed to Charing-cross Hospital, -where the best medical aid was instantly afforded by Dr. Golding and Mr. Hancock, the chief physician and surgeon to the institution. The case of Roueli -was pronounced to be a most dangerous one, and, uLder advice of the medical men, his deposition was at once taken by Inspector Parke, of the V division, under whose care all the wounlded men had been conveyed to the hospital. 31f. Francois 2Napoleon, an Italian, and IL Albert, interpreter at Mareborough-street police court, were sent for, and as soon as they had arrived the dying man's statement was taken, Mr. J. T. Beck, house-suirgeon, supporting the unhappy man and directing the officers how to apply their questions between the paroxysms of agony from which the poor man suffered. The statement was as follows:- A April 17, W45ap..m. "I, Carlo Rouelli, of 45, Rupert-strect, Haymarlket, state that I feel I am dying from the effects of the wounds that I received from the man named Fosehini, in the front parlour of the ground floor of the house between 8 and 9 o'clock p.m. this day. I am not aware of having given any offence or cause for such an attack. Foschini jumped on me like a savage, and stabbed me with a triangular-formed instrument in several places, more particularly in the region of the heart and the head. " C.AILO ROtTELLL Wltnesses-Francois Nanoleon. " John D. Parke." The sufferings of the poor fellow were of the most agonizing character while this deposition was being taken. He rolled about from side to side, as if unable to obtain a moment's relief, and continually exclaimed, "Ah! mio Dio i Ah ! mio Dio Immortale! Come io soffro !" It was generally believed that he could not survive through the night. A very accurate description of the assassin has been obtained by Inspector Parke from ML Rodi; and it is hoped he will not be many hours at liberty. He is a young man, only 23 years of age.

INDIA. [A yortion of the following appeared in our seond ediUon ot yesterday:_-] By the arrival of the Overland Mail wve have received our private correspondence and letters from Bombay of the 19th of March, and from Calcutta of the 9th of March. Our Bombay correspondent writes "BOMBAY, MIARCH 19. "The settlement of the annexed territory of Oude is proceedi%ng rapidly and in perfect tranquillity. The eagerness sith which the change of government is welcomed by all classes, the soldier equally with the peasant, affords additional evidence of the grievous nature of Wajid Ali's rule. The reports 6f the readiness of the King's soldiery to re-enlist are fully confirmed. Two regiments of infantry, which were chiefly employed about the King's person, and to which wvere attached bodies of cavalry and artillery, the whole forniing a kfcid of Royal Guard, have taken aervice under our colours ex mnisse, and are already employed in the districts, under European officers of tact and energy. Two other good regiments have been made over by their late commandants, and so great, we are told, was the rush of individual applicants for military service that the officers recruiting for the Contingent have been forced to refuse two-thirds of them. These rejected remnants of the King's overgrowvn arnmy are meanwhile, together wvith their re-enlisted comrades, receiving, imder the care of MlajorIarriott, all arrears of pay due 'o them in their late service. A disbanded soldiery, carrying the license of the camp ints the village and the homestead, is naturally an -object of terror to the peaceable inhabitants of a district. In Oude, as elsewhere ulnder similar circtunstances, the occurrence of isolated acts of violence is not improbable, but the stern impartial justice of the English rule will powerfully tendto convert the soldier bandit into the peaceful cultivator. The military police is being rapidly organized, and large numbers of Rajpoots have taken service in the corps. " The head-quarters of the Oude Irregular Force are established at Lucknow, in a stately palace on the margin of the river, a spot described as being both beautiful and salubrious. TheBombay officers 'whose names I mentioned in my last have all left by various routes to take up their new appointments. I was mistak-en in including Captain (xell among these gentlemen. His appointment is not to Oude, but to the command of a regiment of Punjab Irregular Cavalry. " Vhile Lucknow is perfectly quiet, and the intentions and proceedings of the deposed King are unlknown andl little thoughto%, the country at large is equally tranquiL. 'The news from the districts,' says the Dzelhi C4czetfe, 'is most cheering. IFrom east and west, from Khyrabad and Bairaitch, 'w-e hear that the cultivators are delighted, the soldiery contented, the landholders and great farmes astonished at the moderation of their new masters, and at the very trilling assessment that has been made. Niowhere have any set of men given any trouble or shown the slightest disposition to dispute the wishes and acts of the British Government.' " We hear of no new disturbanlces in the Santal country, nor is there any fear nowy of an outbreak in Rajpootana. If the differences between the Ranah of Oudeypore and his chiefs be not already amicably settled, a recourse to arms would be prevented by the increasing heat and drought of the season. Throughout the vwhole of India, indeed, all is peace. " There is news from Cabul down to the 25th of February, and from Candahar to the 19th. The Aineer wvas stiU at the latter city, busy in strengthening his position there, and finding, it would appear, considerable difficulties in his way. He has got rid, as I have before mentioned, of his nephew, Mahomed Sadik, who has fled to the Persians. But there remains his elder brother, Rahum Dil Khan, upon whom and his family the Ameer proposed to settle a large allowance in exchange for his principality, but the sturdy or perhaps imbecile old chief refuses "he money, and wishes to quit Aflghanistan altogether. The Dost wvould much prefer having him under his owvn eye, and will probably keep him, lest he should join his nephew and sons at Teheran. While thus disquietedl at Candahar the Dost is said to be anything but at his ease with regard to Herat. There, as we are informed, Prince Yusuf is endearinghimself to the people, lighteninghis assessmentfor the revenue, and granting remissions withnoniggard hand. Strong in the growing attaclunent of his people, the Prince asserts his determination to meet the Ameer should he march upon Herat, and his confidence of being able not only to beat him, but to capture Candahar. That the Dost can maintain himself at the latter city for any lenoth of time is doubted at Cabul. At any rate, with his hands so full as they now are, he cannot well be the aggressive party with regard to Herat; and Prince Yusuf, unsustained by aid from Teheran, will probably remnain n umolesting as unmolested, possibly to play a part hereafter in the game of Central Asia whenthe clear head and strong will of the Dost are gone. "Lord Canning reached Calcutta on the 29th of February, and on the evening of the 6th inst. his predecessor quitted the country which hel has so long and so ably administered. An excellent srnnmary of the principal events, military and civil, of Lord Dalhousie's prolonged Viceroyalty appears in the Fri"ed of India. It is too lengthy to be transferred to your columns in e&:tenso, but may, perhaps, itself be sumiarized, and yet be intelligible. "Arriving in India in January, 1848, the then Earl of Dalhousie assumed the g-overnmnent of an empire at peace with all its neighbours. its arnmy reduced by 50,000 men, its finances i'mproving, though still not fully repaired. The power of the Mabrattas had been broken at Maharajpore and Gwalior; four great battles had bloodily avenged upon the Sikh confederacy their irruption upon British ground. But scarcely had the GovernorGeneral been four months in India when tidings reaclhed him of the revolt of Bloolraj and the 3nurder of the British Envoys at Mooltan. He saw that the whole Sikh nation was about to try their fortune once more against us. ' Gentlemen,' he said, in his speech at Barrackpore, ' if these men -will have wvar, they shall have it, and wvith a vengeance.' In October he started for the NLorth-west Provinces. Though not present with the army the infltuence of his foresight and resolution was felt throughout it. At Umballa he organized an army of reserve, from which reinforcements were forwarded to supply the -ruel losses at Chillian-wallah. Whenthework of the soldier was completed at Guzerat and the Sikhs were finally beaten, it was for Lord Dalhousie to come forwardL as the statesman to pacify and settle the country of the conqluered. And now the true qualities of the Governor-General were seen. Contrary to the alvice of many persons thoroughly conversant writh the Punjab and its inhabitants, conscious that he would meet with disapproval from the Court of Directors, and even, perhaps, but a cold acquiescence from the home Government, lie determined not to re-establish the native regency, not to proclaim the young Rajah under English guardianship, but to incorporate the country into the British empire. The Punjab was annexed as a non-reg-ulation province. A staff of revenue officers larger than in the same area of any regulation province was distributed throughout the country. The population was arbitrarily disarmed, the existing army Largely increased by irregular reginments, and finally-in most happy imitation of the policy of the elder Pitt-the disbanded Sikh soldiery were enlisted into our service. The ad- ministration, at first intrusted to a Board of three Commissioners, was afterwards placed in the single hands of the ablest of the three, Mr. (now Sir John) JLavwrence. In six years this wild country has become a prosperous province. The border tribes are rendered almost innoxious. Roads and canals are completed or in course of construction. Justice is regularly and efficiently administered, and cases of vioent outrage are rarer than ever among the peaceful Benigalees; and finally, spite of the expenditura, the Punjab pays a surplus into the general Treasury. " In 1852 came the war with Burmah, and the haughty proclamation by which the C-overnor-General declared Pegue to be annexed to the British empire. In this new province much has already been done in developing the trade of Rangoon w ith India and the interior, and by the establishment of the electric telegraph. With its iich fields imperfectly cultivated, and its resources not one-tenth developed, Fegue yet pays all its civil expenses, and has caused no addition to the army. " Three other large provinces have been added to our dominions during Lord Daihonsie's rlde-Berar in M ay, :5,4 in payment of the Nizain's debts; Nagpore in July of the same year, by the extinction of the reigning house; and Oude, under circumstances too recent to need repetition. Under his auspices have been inaugurated the railwas,.+he electric telegraph, and the system- of uniform cheap postage. If his least successful operations have been those in finance, it may well be that his failures are to be ascribed to the-existence of difficulties which not even his skl and frnmess could surmount. Mlch as he has done, he has no doubt left some things undone, -but things which, if he had, or could have, -given his personal3 attention to, mig,ht hav been done. But, after allowing for these'slight detractions, the Marquis of Dalhousio leaves in Tndia a reputation scarcely, if at all, second to that of any of its formaer Governors-GeneraL "Sir Robert Hamilton, agent for the GovernorGeneral at Indore, has addressed a letter to Colonel Baker, Secretary to the Government of India in the Public Works Departmient, giving interesting details of the proposed railwaj from the port of Broach to Indore, and on to Agra.,: From Bombay to Broach, and on to Baroda, the capital of the Guicowar; a line is already sanctioned. The surveys, of which Sir Robert now gives the details, were ordered by the Supreme Govemnment at his request. Dividing -the whole distance (upwards of 600 miles) into five sections, Sir Robert shows, by the reports of the surveyors, that in the course of the second section only that from Rajpore Ali to Indore are there any serious difficuilties to be encountered. There the Vindhya range of mountains has to be surmounted, in, as is proposed, an ascent of about 53 miles, with gradients varying from 19 to 33 feet in the mile. The greater part of the country to be traversed is describedaspopulous andwell cultivated, requiring only the means of export to increase production. Indore, the capital of Malwa, is the focus of the trade of Central India, whether from Bombay or from Hindostan, through Rajpootana. The imnpetus which the opium trade would be likely to receive is in the opinion of Sir Robert worthy of special attention. "So deeply interested," he says, "are tlhe mercantile community in this article of trade, that the amount realized at the Electric Telegraphoffice at Indore during a month covers the expense of the establishment." The passenger traffic, he thinks, cannot be over-estimated. ' I There is a constant flowv along the line. In addition to the ordinary passengers, the whole of the pilgrims toe-ecca, Dwarka, and other ordinary shrines, are daily seen journeying along the route, while through Saugor, from the Gangetic Valley, the salt consumed in Central India, the spicos brolught by sea, the importations froni Europe, and the seaborne traffic will supply to the railway an amount of tonnage which must be anmply remunerative.' " In conclusion, Sir Robert informs Government that from Holkar, from the chiefs of Dhar, Bhopal, and other districts, and from the mercantile communities of all the principal towns, he has received communications or deputations expressive of the ardent desire of all that this great boon should be extended to them. " The Great Indian Peninsular Railway is working fast on to Poonais from the top of the Bore Ghaut, to the foot of which it will be open from Bombay continuously by the mliddle of Alay. Four years are given to the contractor to complete the ascent of the ghaut. His contract is 750,000I.. The works will be on an immense scale, including, I believe, 10 tunnels, viaducts with a span of 1,G00 feet, and piers of 210 feet in height. The portion of the line from the top of the ghaut to Poonah will be open in less than two years, and beyond Poonah to the southward the line has been let as far as Sholapore, and the works will be commenced immediately. At the river Kristna it will join the line from Mladras. " The electric telegraphs is so recent an institution in India that the latter half of Lord Dalhousie's reign has seen both its introduction and its completion. In April, 1852, the scheme was laid before the Governor-General. It was immediately adopted, anda superintendent,Dr. O'Shaughnessy, senttoEngland for workmen and materials. In October he returned, and the work commenced. The line was opened to Agra in MLarch, 1854, to Bombay in July, to Lahore in October, and to MIadras on the 1st of January, 1855. Between Agra and Bombay the work was very severe, owing to the absence of roads and bridges and the prevalence of jungle fever. No fewer than 20 miles of river cable had to be laid down in all. Later in the past year the Grand 1runkLine was announced as complete, 'and Madras aid Bombay, Agra and Calcutta, Calcutta and Lahore, were united by an almost instantaneous communication.' The magnitude and extent of the work has been thus illustrated :-'Imagine a line of telegraph extending from London to Trieste, thence running to Archangel, and then trending oiouthward to Marseilles, and you will understand oigmething of its leng,th. Imagine Europe 6,000 [niles from an iron mine or a factory, withiut artificers, without tools, without engineers, ~overed with a dense jungle, and visited during wvo months in every year with one long coninued storm of rain, and you may comprehend some portion of the difficulties over which Dr. O'Shaug,hnessy finallly triumphed. The average cost of the whole was a fraction more than 50O rupees a-mile. On the great American lines it was equivalent to 400 rupees. "Here we have little news. The scarcity of water is becoming daily more appreciable, and many of the natives who have no particullar ties inBombay are leaving for their towns -or villages in the Dleccan or elsewhere. The railwvay, however, is beginning its labours, and will shortly bring in uipwards ot 100,000 gallons a-day. " Sir Matthewv Sausse, the newf Puisne Judlge, arrrived by the last mail; Sir Wrilliam and Lady Gomm, who have been staying with Lord Elphinstone, leave~ by this. " The B3ishop has returned to the Presidency, after a prolonged tolur of four months and upwards in Scinde and Guzerat, during whichl his lordship, in company with M,rs. H arding, visited all the stations of the clergy in those districts, and travelled nearly 2,000 miles. "Lord Elphinstone remains atBombay for the present. The head-quarters of the army move to Mlahabuleshwar next week. B3rigadier Mackenzie leaves by this mail, on meclical certificate, for 15 months. " There has been an improvement both in the import and export markets, and a further improved demand i's looked for. The money-market is somewhat tighter." The following is the letter of our Calcutta correspondent ~" CALCUTTA, MAIiMcH 9. " Lord Canning, the new Governor-General, arrived in Calcutta on the 29th FRebruary, and according to usage was sworn in at once. The ceremoniial is not imposing, being chiefly remarkable for the absence of any attempt to invest it with a religious character. " On the 5th inst., the address fronm the inhabitants of Calcutta was carried up to Lord Dalhiousie. Thoulgh faint and weak wtith work and suii'ering his Lordship stood up to receive the deputation, and* read the subjoined reply: "s' Mr. Sheriff ald. Gentlemen,-I receivec the senatiments which you have addressed to me on the part of the inhabi-. tnts of the city of Calcutt3 with the deepest feelings of gratification and pride; of pride, that anx administration w-hich has been prolonged through more than eight years~ should command at its close so general a tribute of approba- tion and applause; of gratification, that the inhabitants of.I the capital of the Indian emnpire should have framzed their judgment of me in terms so honourable to my name, and should have pronounced it in tones of such manifest cordiality. "'I Rest assured that the approving voice of his countrymen-the deliberate, concurrent, and hearty coninendation of those among whom he has long lived and acted-is the reward which sustains the heart of a public man, which affords him compensation for long years of exile, and niakes him amends for the toils and cares, the injustice and ill. will, which form the burden that must be borne by every man who serves the State. " ' It is not for me, gentlemen, to speak of the events and the measures of past years, on which you have dwelt with such favourable regard. Bu3t it may be permitted to me to look forwvard -with you, and to express a hope that, as I leave you, the prospect is fair and full of promise. "'No prudent man having any knowledge of Eastern affairs would ever venture to predict a prolonged continuation of peace in India. We have learned by hard experience how a difference with a native Power, which seems at first to be but the little cloud no bigger than a man's hand, may rapidly darken and swell illto a storm of war, involving the whole empire in its gloons. We have lately seen how, in the very midst of us, insurrection may rise like an exhalation from the earth, and how cruel violence, worse than all the excesses of war, may be suddenly committed by men who, to the very day on wlhich they broke out in their frenzy of blood, have been regarded as a simple, harmless, timid race, not by the Government alone, bub evenL by those who knew them best, who were dwelling among them, and were their earliest victims. "'Remembering these things, no prudent rman wiU venture to give you assurance of continued peace. "' But we seem to have every reasonable ground for be. lieving that tranquillitywithin and without is likely now to prevail in India, and that thus fair scope will be given for the prosecut.on of those projects of internal improvement on which the Government has largely entered. - 'While we have a right to congratulate ourselves on :what 'has alreadybeen done; while we may regard with complacency the introduction into the East of 'those great instruments of public benefit whicE science has long since created in the West; while-we may'rejoice that measures have been already taken for opening new sources1of public wealth, for ministering to the convenience; for increasing the happiness, and for raising the mental and social condition of the endless millions whom Providence for its own wise ends has conunitted to onr charie-I trust we still shall 'feel that aU'we have yet done must be regarded as no nore than the first beginniigs of greater thingithat are to come. In regions so vast as these and among interests so vaxious all progress must needs be gradual and slow. But I leave you with the firm belief, and in the confident hope, 'that public improvement among you will now advance with I steady pace, sustained by the vwise and liberal'spirt wvhich is yearly animating more and more the minds of all who exercise an influence on Indian affairs. "'You have made kindly allusion to the fature that mar awvait me. I do not seek to fathom that future. My only ambition long has been to accomplish the task which lay before me here, and to bring it to a close with honour and success. It has been permitted to me to do so. I have played out my part. And while I feel that, in ny case, the principal act in the drania of mylife is ended, I shall be vell content if the curtain should drop now upon my public course. ' Nearly 13 years have passed away since first I eon tered the service of the Crown. Through all those years, with bat one short interval, public employment of the heaviest responsibility and labour has been imposed upon n.e. I am wearied and worn, and have no other thought or wish than to seek the retirement of which I stasid in need, and which is all I now am fit for. "'But, whatever the future may unfold, you have not erred in believing that I shall never cease to regard with deep 'and unfailing interest the land for which 1 have toiled so long, and those with whom and for whom I have laboured. "'Before I quit its shores I earnestly desire to acknowledge, in the presence of you all, the deep debt of gratitude which I owe to those among whom I have lived and' ruled so long; gratitude to successive colleagues in the Council for their constant aid through eight long years, without one hour of discord or distrust; gratitude to the many able and zealous and earnest men by whom the civil admlinistration in all its various branches has been invigorated and assisted; gratitude to the gallant army, by which the honour of the country has been upheld, its power extended, and its general tranquillity secured; gratitude to all, for the confidence they have reposed in me, for the support they have given, for the fairness and forbearance with which they have judged. Above all, now in this parting hour,when the memory of each among us is thoughtfully resting for a time on the eventful years through which, we have passed together, I desire humbly and reverently to acknowledge the gratitude which is due for the ever present protection of Him from whose hand alone are the issues of war. " xr. Sheriff and Gentleumen, I have now but one more word to add-it is a word which I find it hard to utter,FarewelL. Govermnent-house, March 5, 1856.' On the 6th inst. he quitted Government-house. He was attended to the landing-place by a large concourse of gentlemen, -who evinced the most lively marks of sympathy and sorrow at his departure. I Some were litermlly unable to do more thani bow a farewell; an attempt to give him a parting cheer I as his boat pushed off brolke down. Men's throats i were too full, and several ladies lay back in their carriages sobbing audibly. This e-xhibition of feeling is the more striking because Lord Dalhousie is in no degree a 'popular' man. He has lived latterly i a most secluded life, and, though many acts of kindness are recorded of him, he has found severity very fiequently essenitial; still he is bitterly regretted. The truth is that for eightyears he has been really our king, in the old sense of the word. His colleagues in council have, almost up to the last year of his reign, been men vwithout hold upon the com- munity. His well-known habit of deciding for I himself has exempted him from all other infuence, and in all serious questions the commucity have looked to himn alone. In every danger tnen have been accustomed to ask, not w-hat ought to be done, or what will Government do, i but ' -What does Lord Dalhousie say ?' This con- fidence has been on the whole fairly justified. His ! course has upon all occasions been, even if mistaken, clear, firm, and consistent, and his success such as has fallen to the lot of but few statesmen. He has begun two great wars, and carried both to a triumphant issue. He has annexed four great kingdoms, and they are all quiet, obedient, and contented, while one of theni has become the model province of I India. He defined the principles upon which railways in India ought to be constructed, and already thefirst section of the line in Bengal is earning profits in excess of the guarantee. He broke through at official traditions to give Dr. O'Shaughnessy absolute power over the electric telegraph depart-. ment, and already we have 4,000 miles of telegraph at work and paying. It has long been the object of Government to secure a supply of iron from Upper India. All kinds of offers, experiments, and in- quiries have been made, bult they have all failed.| Either the iron was bad, or there wvas no fu31, or no flux, or the geologists differed with the practical miners, or, in short, there was some cause for a break down. At last MIr. James Hunt, the ablesti and most successful of our railway contractors, un- dertook the task. After some months of investiga-i tion, conducted at great ex~pense, he discovered a mine and a coalfield in juxtaposition. He then went up to (Govemnmes4, offering, if the minerals were made over to him, according to an implied, promise long since advertised, he wXould produce so eany thousand tons of iron in a limited time. As usual, there were all kinds of difficulties, offlcial and otherwise; but Lord D)alhousie comprehended toI the full the immense advantage offered to the Go- I vernment, brushed away the forms, and secured the iron toMAfr. Hunt. In a few years, therefore, the rails we now import with so much difficulty and ecpense will be supplied from the 'Dalhousie Ironworks.' It has been the same in minor matters. The only necessity for anybody was to see that the Governor-General reallv attended to his claim, or' offer, or grievance, or project. A distinct unmis- 1 takeable refusal or a strong energetic support w-as sure immediately to follow. You, pestered as you I are by officials whose only idea of statesmanship is compromise, can comprehend the position a man of this class, wielding uncontrolled authority, gradually assumed. It is not too. much to say that i for the last six years the individual opinion of Lord Dalhousie has been as importait to India as that of Louis Napoleon is to France. " One severe disappointment he has sustained. It is understood to have been one of Lord Dalhousie's strongest wishes that the Crown should acknowledge the moritz of his most able assistants in administration. The request was acknowledged, but there has beensome delay, and. the honours long expected have not arrived. I understand, though it is impossible to speak quite positively, that the gentlemen recommended were M:. John Laurence, the chief commissioner' of the Punjab, who shares with Lordx Dalhousie the credit of the regeneration of that province; General Outram; General Mark Cubbon, the uprighlt -and successful commissioner of Mysore; and MIajor Phayre, conmnissioner of Pegu, andI second founder of Rangoon. All these were recommended for the Bath. I)r. O'Shaughnessy, the officer who has conipleted the telegraph, was to be Knight and C.B., and Mr. Stephenson, to whom we owe the railway, simply a Knight. The latter nomination is not Jord Dalhousie's fault. It seems that amid the mystic laws in which heralds and officials delight there is one by which the civil K.C.B. can be pgranted only to men wlo have distingnuished themselves in Government service. That is, MIr. Brunel is not to receive the honour which may be bestowed upon a General Simpson. Surely it is time such a distinction,- if it really exists, should be done away. Mr. Stephenson has toiled now for nearly 10 years at his great scheme. With what unconquerable ! ardour, with vwhat expenditure of strength, withi iwhat quiet slow-footed judgment he has carriedI it on, none know, Sir, better than yourself. I Yet he does not rece*ve a reward granted to General Outram. As I said before, Lord Dalhousie would most gladly have remedied the inequality, and secured for MIr. Stephenson even a more permanent reward. The commiiunity of Gscutta have presented him with an address, signed by at least 150 firms and every official of emllinnce. It ex:presses the universal belief of tle vomnTlunity that without 3Yr. Stephenson we should, ha-ve had no rail and the shareholders no prospect of a dividend. "This prospect seems a near one. Heretofore the enornious worliing expensea swallowed -up -the profits. They amounted to G8 per cent. on the receipts. During the last half-year, -howevei,, Mfr. Stephenson, aided by a keen traffic m'nageF, has reduced them to .41 per -cent.' The-net receipts, therefore, amounted to 3j per'cent. :But the-company iS under contract to -coniey 110,(O00 tons 'of coal a-year. Only a portioni of 'this quaitlt 'was carried in the last sir mbiiths'; and when this'Ais added, as at present it is being added, t'he ""'4fts will amount to about 6 pereriit. There is, therei: -, every reason to believe that during -thi's urrnt half-year'the East Indiani Railway is earning mote than the. guaranteed 5 per cen.t- "The telegraph has been almost equally succe-sful, but this is in Govcrnme,.t. bhandz_ The 4;00D miles already const-iit&d have 6ost 200,0001., or 20 lacs of rupee3. ':he inouthly expenditune amounts to 25,090r. The monthly reoeilits, offic.al messages ,included, have just reached that figure. One-third ,of all- the messages eve seat l?y ni.tives, who have7a strange,- out- of-tho-wav fancy, for this method of communication, It is a positive fact, absurd as it may seem, that they prefer it-. to'.t-he post as a depository of secrets. "The mercantile conimuniity of. Madras have requested permission to' increase the capital of that bank from 30 to 50. lacs of rupees. A similar movement will, it is said, be made in Calcutta, The last increase to the capital of the Bank of Bengal was made .in 1839. It was .then raised to 1,070,0001. At that period the trade of Calcutta amounted to 11,737,6001. It was in 1853-54 upwards of 19,000,0001., and has since -increased, some say, to 22.000,0001. The bank is the only one in Bengal which 'can issue notes and' which restricts itself. almost entirely to commercial business. The capital is too small for the trade. On the slightest pressure, therefore, men with Company's paper in their hands cannot obtain loans at less than 1.2 per cent., and business is unduly and unnaturally repressed. It is proposed, therefore, to petition Govermnent for permission to increase the sum, but to what extent it is difficult to anticipate. It wll not, howvever, I imagine, be an increase of mnore than 50 per cent. - "I anm told that the allowance granted by Government to the Idol Temple at Pvoree has been discontinued, under orders from home. The abolition of this grant has been an object w ith Indian missionaries and philanthropists for some years." COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. BOMBAY MARKETS. FRO03 THE 5TH To ME 18TH OF MARCH. The Overland Mail of the 11th ultimo was received at Bombay on the 9th Mlarch, per Peninsular and Oriental steamer Singapore. Our monev-market during the fortnight has, contrary to expectation, become slightly.tighter, and the banks in consequence have not reduced their rates of interest, as anticipated in our last; but it is generally supposed the present pressure will be only temporary, and that he rates of interest now ruling vril not. be maaintained. Government Securities have given w. ay in value since our last report. I3reoTs.

EGYPT. I (FOBt oiUR OvN- COR SrPON.-D .). ALEXANDRIA, ARIL 5.. Said Pasha has during the last few days been 'rushing about the country in the most fanciful manner. Eis Highness first started from Alexandria at the utmost speed of the railway to look at his new toy, a palace on the banks of the Nile, which he has. purchased from one of his nephews for 1l0,000. sterling; thence he proceeded to the barrage of the Nile, where he is erecting extensive fortifications, which can never be of any use; then he came down the Nile to Cafr-el-Ais, whence he summoned by electric telegraph from Alexandria an accession of troops to the 2,000 cavalry and infantryhe always takes about with him. At Cafi-el-Ais he expressed *his intention of going to the great fair of Tantah, in the'[)elta, which was then taking place, but changed -his mind, and went down the Nile to Atfeh, where 'some measures are finally to be taken for the deepeningr of the canal. From Atfeh he returned to Cafrel-Ais, and wlent to Tantah, where he spent a couple of days, and had the dancing girls to perform in his -presence. Suddenly he gave orders to take down all the tents, and, mounting on horseback, he started in the direction of the railway station, where preparations *were hurriedly made to receive his Highness, but he said he was not going by the railway, and proceeded down the line. The train started, and soon overtook his Highness, who immediately called out to the engine-driver to stop. The Viceroy dismounted, and, on the plea of unwillingness to disturb the passengers, he gets on to the locomotive, sits in the coke, and is now in Alexandria. The working of the railway between Alexandria and Cairo is often interrupted by Said Pasha's hasty movements and the constant conveyance of his troops. Delays and disordersfrequentlv occur, and c the only reply that lis Highness makes to any observation on the subject is, that the railroad is entirely his own, that he maust be served first, and the transit afterwards. Several robberies of specie and of goods have again occurred, and the complaints of the lack of system and vigilance are loud and frequent. The Mahmoodieh Canal being closed to navigation the railway is almost the only means the merchants have of bringing their goods to Alexandria, and, though the charges are enormous, no care is taken of their property. Last week a train that was bringing to Alexandria 20 trucks, wittLl,100 bales of cotton, caught fire, and the whole was corapletely destroyed, the cotton being placed on the trucks without any precaution to save it from the sparks of fire from the engine. Lord Dalhousie, late Governor-General of India, arrived at Suez, in the East India Company's steamer Feroze, on the 2d inst., and will proceed to Europe on the 7th or 8th inst., in Her XajesWs steamer Caradoc.
THE AMIEXATION OF OuDE.-The week has been fill of rumours of events about to transpire in Oude. Mlost ofthem.have referred to some impending disaster. The mob of the capital was about to rise. 'The artillerymen were in revolt. The soldiers looked gloomy and discontented. The nDeople held obstinately aloof, or showered imprecations oRs the British. The Hiindoo lRajahs were arming to defend their rights. M1an Singh, and the Zemindar of Toolseepore had each collected 50,000 warriors. The lYepaulese had promised assistance, and were about to descend in irresistible force. Troops had been urged for; wardbyimperative orders, transmitted through the telegraph. With these old iives' tales were mingled others of snore malignant character. Lucbnow had been plundered. and the people insulted by the Europeans. The King was on his waytolayhisturbanat thefootofthethrone. The Government had seizedhis property, and had sequestratedmoney advancedto itinthe hour of need. The wives of theKing had been compeUed to bury their jewels for fear of spoliation. Captain Hayes, of all men in Oude, was the one appointedi to insult them. Some of these stories may possibly be i native rumours, exaggerated by translation. The remainder, we fear, are deliberate inventions.' Not only has there been no d^nzeutc, and no invasion, but there has been a marked promptituide and alacrity in recognizing the new Govern-. ment. By what class are.we to decide? The soldiers are perhaps in an Oriental monarchy the most independent e- ponents of the feeling of the people. The King's bodyguard, the Coldsteams of Oude, ummediately after the annexation stepped forward, expressing their readiness to serve the Company. The regiment of cavalry, belonging to the same corps, followed their example. 60 men only of the infantry refused, and their refusal placed the general feeling in the strongest light. Every one of the 60 was was a gholam or personal retainer of the ing's confidential eunuchs. The regiments are now commanded by European officers, and have taken the English military oath. Rajah Sobah Singh wields an immense influence inLucLknow. He commanded the finest regiment in the service, one of the few in Onde reaUy equipped, dressed, armed, and provided with guns. He voluntarily stepped forward to offer his services and those of his best officers and men. In one instance the AMahomedans held back. The reason was asked, and the native officers respectfully urged their reluctance to part with their beards. They were allowed to retamn them, and to a man swore fidelity to their new colorurs. If we try the general feeling by that of the upper classes, we find the same result. The proclamation was forwarded speciaUy to 79 men of rank throughout the country. The list included the nobles, the greater landholders, the influential Talookdars. Replies havebbeenreceived from allbut 14, and in all cases tbereply is a tender of the hearty allegiance of the writer. The Rajah of Toolseepore in particular, of whose defection so much has been made, has forwarded letters of the most submissive character. He has, moreover, given a material gnarantee for his fidelity by dibbanding his retainers, who flock to the British recruiting-office at Baraitch. Yet these are the only men who can even comparatively lose by annexation. They forfeit the opportunity of distinction, the chance of resiting an assessment, and a more than feudal power among their omvn retainers They gain in return a new secur<ity for life and property, and they have accepted the exchange. At present, in a word, thrrughout the lengtb^ and breadth of the land where- i ever there is not congratulatioA there is an utter apathyFr7ie77d of India.

On that ground the decision of the House of Commons on Tuesday night, however abortive and ridiculous,-is deeply to be regretted. We do not know that MIr. Spooner is exactly to be blamed, for he has long ago thrown off the dominion of prudential considerations, and is doubtless willing, so far as his personal reputation and interests are concerned, to brave any consequences that may ensue from acts of controversial hostility to the church of Rome. How is it possible to. blame a gentleman -who. is capable of telling the House of Commons that " they might rest assured there was, at the present moment, an earnest intention on the part of the Roman Catholics to claim the right of succession for a Roman Catholic king, for which they mntended to make a struggle." Many a man has been held irresponsible for the commission of murder on evidence less conclusive as to the absence of a mischievous intention. "You cannot expect," as Dean Swift said, "to reason a man out of an opinionwhich he was never reasoned into ;" and, therefore, we do not think that Mr. Spooner personaly is either to be seriously argued with or seriously condemned. But it is the majority of the House of Commons, not carried beyond its judgment by fanaticism, but swayed to this or any other extravagance by motives of faction or caprice, which may justly be called on to give an account of its conduct to the country. The hopes with which Sir P. feel 11 years ago changed the form of the assistancegranted to Maynoothfrorn an annual vote to a permanent endowment have been signaUy disappointed; and that, too, not in a time of fierca religious agitation, such as we have traversed intho interval, but in the umidst of profound domestic peace, produced not more by the sober and industrious qualities-which the Irish people are heginning to develope than by the lovalty and good faith for which the clergy of the popular faith hava lately been distinguished. We know, indeed, that the mischief will not bc suffered to proceed very far in this instance; hut it is impossible not to reflect with some apprehension on what such a Parliament may do before iht decisions can be overhauled, or ite powers transferred to a worthier depository.-Manci&ser Guardi4an.
TEHE MUBDER OP THE coU2TESS CAUMZfRT LA FORUcE. The trial of AntoimeBeaumi for the murder of the CoGnusedeCaumontlaForce tookplacoeonWeanesdaybefore the Court of Asizes of the Seine. A great part of the spacD appropriated to the public was filled 'with ladies, several of wnom wvere indeep moinnin", and tho other part of the place was densely crowded. .n a table was a parcel containing the clothes worn by the Countess at the moment of her death. M. 2elElbe ws counsel for the prisoner. At half-past 10 Beaumann was brought in. -He is a man of short- stature, and was dressed respectably in a darkcoloured frock-coat aud black cravat; his demeanour was exceedingly quiet and composed After he had declared, in answer to the questions of the- Court that he was a native of Xhecklenburg, 32 years jf age, and a groom by occupation, the idictment WaS r. It differs but little in the circumstances*which it details from the account of the murder given at the time it was perpetrated. It, howvever, states that it was a person named Lefilleul, sa.et de chal'afre of M. van den Bruck, occupying the adj'oning hotel, who Iirst heard the cries of distress and groans proceeding from the hotel of the Countess. Thinking that he recognized the voice bf that lady, he mentioned the circiumstance to his feUlow-servantf lnnocent, who proceeded to the entrance of the hotel Cautnont La Force, while Lefilleul k-ept watch at the side of the garden. Innocent having perceived a Bergent-de-viile, named Pett, went up to him and communicated their suspicions. The police officer went up to knock at the door of the hotel, when it was opened from the inside, and Bea appeared with his hands and face stained with blood. When qnestioned by the police azent he at first declared that he was going to drink aglas3 of brandy at a neighbour. ing winshop, but afterwards, when pressed with questions, he said, " have just Idlled my mistress," without appearing in anyway agitated. He then admitted the -two men -into the yard, and, openig the doorof the stable, he showed the dead body of the Countess lyin" under a heap of straw, wvith a number of pieces of irewoo throwzn over her. All the details already given of the mauner in which the prisoner entered the service of the murdered lady, of the altercations which arose between them, and of the blow with which he felled her to the ground, are repeated in the indictment; also of his having ascended into the apartment of the Countess after the murder, and tak-en 45 francs froni her workbox. The indictment did not accuse him- of premeditated murder, but only of homicide. The prisoner, when interrogated by the President, declared that one minute before the dispute with his mistress he had not had the s]ightest idea of injuring herthat it was all the effect of a sudden inpulse when his patiencehadatlast givenway. He had been frequently tormentedcbvher unjustreproaches, but no ideaof injuring herhadeveroccurred to him. The mannerin which the dispute arose on the fatal rormng was described by the prisoner in this way. :-"Ny mistress desired me to ioak for a piece of iron which. she had before twice spoken to ne about, but which I had not found. She said, 'Come with me and look for that iron.' I replied, 'I have looked for it already enough.' She insistedthat I had not. I lost my temper, and then-the act took place." When interrogated as to his motives for carrying the body into the stable and covering it with straw, he declared that he did not know what he was doing at the time. During the course of a long interrogatory the prisoner alwvays replied clearly and to the point, and on one or two occasions shed tears. After his examination a number of witnesses deposed to the circumstances described in the indictment, and Mladame Gerard, widow of hle Marshal, gavea very favourable account of the deceased Countess, whowas her niece, assertig that she was a most kdindhearted and well-conducted woman, though somewvhat eccentric. The Advocate-General de Vallee supported the accusation, and IL Nibelle spoko in favour of the prisoner. The learned counsel, commenting on the nature of the evidence, maintained that the act of violence perpetrated on the deceased was the result altogether of a sudden movement of exasoeration, without any premeditation of causing death. In conseqence, whatever verdict the jury should arrive at, it must be accompanied with circumstances of extenuation. The President then sunmed up the evidence, and the jlury, after a very short deliberation, returned a verdict of Gzutlty, but with extenuating circumistances. The Court sentenced the prisoner to imprisonment, Xwith hard labour, for life. The following sketch ef the family of Caumont La Force wi be read vith interest-:-The lordship of l-a Force, situate in Perigord, gave its name to two branches of the house of Caumont, -wich derives its origin fromn that countrv. It was first possessed by Jacques Nompar de Caumont from his mother,Philippa de Beaupoil de La Force. It was raised to a marqute in 1609 by Henri IV., and into a duchy by Louis XIII., inl037. JacquesNompar do Canmont, first duke of La Force, peer and marshal of France, who was born about 1559, was son of Francois de Caumont, who fell in the massacre of St. Bartholomew on the 24th of August, 1572. Several versions have been given as to the place where this sanguinary event occurred, and as to the circumstances under which the youngest of the children of Caumont escaned death. Some writers pretend that it was at the Louvre that the murder was effected, while others as positively assert that it was at tle Hotel de La Force, opposite the church of St. Paul. This hotel had originally belonged to the brother of St. Louis, Charles d'Anjou, who became King of lNaples and Sicily. In 1292 it passed into the hands of Charles deValois and the Counts d'Alencon. Charles VL, who before his insanity passed his time in tournaments and carrousels, regarded this habitation w-ith an envious eye, as, from its being close to the Culture Sainte Catherine, it was very convenient for his exercises of chivalry, and to repose himself after his combats. His desire was expressed to Pierre d' Aleuion, who offered his palace and its dependencies to the Kingz. Charles V71. deigned to accept them all by letters patent of the 26th of Nay. 1390. After his death the hotel'passedinto the hands of the Rings of Navarre, and at a later period into those of the Counts de Tancarville. Cardinal de iNeudon afterwrards became proprietor of it, and commenced rebuilding it in 1553, the works, however, not being completed by him, but bythe Chancellor de Birague. At the death ofthe latter, in 1583, Antoine do Roquelaure purchased the hotel, and afterwards sold it to Francois d'Orieans do Lognveville, Count de St. Pal. It was aftervwards purchasedhby Chavigny, and byhina given as a dowry tobis daughter, who marredthe Duke de Caumont LaForce. At t'cat time itchanged itsname for that of HOtel de la Force. It afterwards became the property of Mlademoiselle Toupenel, andin l7SOit was .purchased byorderof Louis XVL and converted into a prison, which wasdemolished abouttwo yearsago. The Caumontwhohadso miraculously escaped the massacre of the Protestants became the friend of Henri lV., whose confidence he always enjoyed. He was in the carriage with that Monarch when the attempt was made on his life inthe Rue de la Ferronnerie. During the first years of thereign of Lonis XIIL some subjects ot discontent removed De Caumont from the Court. He was afterwards reconciled to the Ring, and made a marshal of Franiee. He was sent in quality of Lieutenant-General into Piedmont, where he dibtinguished himself on several occasions. He died at Bergerac on the 10th of Nay, 1652, at the age of 93. His direct descendants played important parts in State affairs up to 1764, when the family became extinct in the person of Armand Nompar de Caumont, sixth duke cf La Force, who left his titles to the second ducsl branch, which now exists, and which was then represented by Bernard de Caumont, who, in 1757, marriecl his cousin, the daughter of the Count de Beam, aud, by Olympe de Caumont, heiress of the first branch. The family of Caumaont La Force,-one of the most distinguished ;of theFrench nobility,-has constantly rendered eminent .ser,vices to the country. Count Augustus de Camnmont La Fcrce, ,now a senator, is the brother of the iNarquis de La Force. *He married lademoiselke Antoine de Celle, daual"ter of tho Count do Celle, formerly Belgian Ainbassa-o. This family is allied to those of Lagrange Valence, Genlis, arshal iGcrard, &c. Nadame do Gealis, in her Xeaois, speaks of two girls, PulchGrie aun Antonine, and it is 'he latter who became Iadame de Ca-nmont La Force, and was tl'e victim. of the late murder.
THEM OON CONTROYERSY. TO TH DITOR OF THE TDIES. Sir,-Qualis af, fnceplo, 11r.Symons, who began -with wondering at the ignorance of astronomicalwriters in saying the moon turns on her axis, and denounced the stupidity of his opponents, instead of trying to answer them, now descendsto the bluster of the betting-ring, and asks me, " On what terms will yoa back the experiments you suggest ?" Why on these, and pretty good ones too for him. If he has de-terity enough to perfonn the expernments pr operly. andsatisfyhalf-a-dozen sensiblepeoplethathe can fairlymak;e them not answer as I say they will, he has only to waite to ihC iTimnes and say so, and he will have gotwhat he has been writing all these letters for-notmerelya victory over me and his other opponents here, but over Herschel ind Hind, and aUl the astronomers vhose knowledge of their scienco he will then have shown to be as nothing compared with that of lr. JeEnger Symons, "Her Majesty's Inspector of Schobs" Those are the terms on one side; and on the other, if he will not perform the experiment (which he, not I, suggested, only without dreaming that it could be really performed in a terrestrial and possible way), or if he performs it, and is not able to satisfy some reasonable number of sensible people that the result is contrary to what I said it would be, -why, then he has got himself into a rather awkward and ignominious scrape, and must expect to be laughed at accordingly, even in his own schools, for some time to come. I may add that I find the experiment requires even less delicacy than I expected. It will answer perfectly with a mere disc of tin for the moon, hollowed a little in the middle to make it balance easily on a strong needle stack point upwards near the end of a bar of wood revolving horizontally. You can hold the disc with your fanger while you turn the bar, so as to keep some mark upon the disc facing the axis on which the bar turns, and let it go just before yon stop thomotion of the bar. In the converse experiment you have 6nly to turn the bar, leaving the disc alone; and then it will not revolve (except in its orbit), but will present all its circumference in succession to the aXis of the bar, thus showing that an additional force was neces. sary to make themoon torn on its axis besides turning round the earth. t And here Imust tale leaveof the moon and Nr.

The Lords present were the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Clancarty, and Tord Milford. SIR ROBERT -EXZIES, BART,, V. 3'fOlxALU. This was an 3ppeal fromna decision of the Court of Session ln Scotland in an action of declarator, raised at the in- stance of the appellant, Sir Robert Menzies, against ajor- I Genezrl John M'Donald, the respondent, in respect to the right of the latter to enjoy the fisheries, &c., of Loch Rannock, a lake of about 11 miles in length and two in breadth, situated in the county of Perth. The chief question turned upon the construction to be put upon a charter raxlted to one of the ancestors of the appelant in 1502 by JKing James IF., and to the title which was conveyed to the respondent as the purchaser of certain lands bordering upon the said lake. The arguinents in favour of the appellant were not concluded when the House adjourned. The Solicitor-General, Sir F. Kelly, and Mr. Anderson appeared in support of the appeal; and the Lord-Advocate and Mr. E. Palmer for the respondent.

VTrC-MCANCELLOR'S COURT. ARxr 17. STEEDWAN V. MURSH. tRefoig Vire-Chancdlor Sir W. P. WOOD.) This w;. a demurrer to a bill filed by the plaintiff to restrain the defendant from proceeding with an action at law brought by him against the plaintiff to recover damages for an Uegerl infrin'ement of a patent granted to the defendant in ' 55 as tle inventor of a new mode of constructing pianofo-tes, in the manufactare of which articles the plaintiff and the defendant were both engaged, and had been formerly engaged together in partnership. The case made by the bill was that the invention for which the patent had been granted was, in fact, the invention of one Milligan, a manufacturer of pianofortes at Lima, in the Republic of Peru, and that a plan or drawing of the invention, with a description of it, had come to the hands of the defendant in En;land under circumstances (set forth in the bill) which constituted the defendant a trustee of the patent for 3lMigan, who was the real owner of the invention, and by whose authority and direction the pianos made by the plaintiff on the principle of that invention had been constructed Independently of the circumstances stated in the bill, and on vhich the plaintiff relied for his contention, there was a substantive allegation that the defendant "was and is a trustce"of the said letters patent forMilligan, wsho, as the beneficial owner thereof, had ful powver to authorize the plaintiff to construct the pianos in question. And the bill also alleged that a suit was nowv pending in the court, in which Mlligan w-as plaintiff, to have that benefcial ownership established against the defendant. There was also an allegation that the defendant had, in fact, acted as and was the agent of the "plaintih" in England, the word " plaintiff" having been introduced into the printed bil by inadvertence for the wvords "the said Thomas Milligan." To this bill a demurrer was put in for want of equity, and also on the ground tlhat Miulligan wi-as not a party. Mr. CisrPS, Q.C., appeared in support of the demurrer, and contended that there w-as nothing in the facts stated in the bill which could lead to the conclusion that the defendant held these letters patent as a trustee at all ; and that, unless the facts stated did show it, the mere substantive alegastion that he was a trustee was not sufficient, more especialy in a case like this, where it appeared on the bill itself that the question of title was in litigation between lilligan .and the defendant. If the bill was to be maintaied, all the pianoforte manufacturers in England might get orders from Mlilligan in Peru to construct pianos on the newly-invented principle, and the defendant's right at law estopped by bills founded on a simil.ar equity. Mr. RO LT and Mr. WI LLLXuFRnEEMLN supported the bill. The VICE-CHLINCELLOR said it was to be regretted that the bil did not more distinctly allege the trusteeship, but it wvas equally to be regretted that a demnrrer should have bDeen put in, as, if allowed, it was a case in wvhich, of course, liberty would aLso be given to the pLintiff to amend. Unfortunately, the charge that the defendant was "general agent" for Mulligan was not found in the bill by reason of the accidental mistake whihie had been m.ade in this respect; and, although in the present form of pleading a substantive and distinct averment that the defendant held as trustee might (on demurrerat least) be sufficient, yet when that Was coupled, as in this case, with other averments which did not amount to such a conclusion, the Court must look at the whole bill, and the substantive averment be held insufficient to support the equity. With regard to the objection that Mlilligan, the alleged cestuqglee trust, was not a party, his Honour said that, although a simple averment of trusteeship would not be sufficient when it was a case of a disputed trust, yet on demurrer it must be taken to be admitted, and, being admitted, there was no reason s-hy aplaintiff shouldnot file a bill in this court to restrain a trustee from proceeding against him at law without bringing the nersons for whom he wvas trustee before the Court. On tke wvhole, the demurrer must be allowed ;withoUt costs, hut with liberty to amend.

UOLLTIEE (with whom was Mr. Karslake) moved for a rule calling on the plaintiff to show cause why the verdicb which had been found in his favour for 2,5001. should not be set aside and a new trial granted, upon the ground of misdirection andl that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was brought by one medical man against another for alleged breaches of covenant in a deed of partnership!. It appeared at the trial, which took place before Mr. Serjeant Chaunell at the last assizes for the county of Somers-et, that one of the questions wvas wvhether the plain- iff was entitled to recover the sun which be claimed under the deedasliquidated damages, or, as the defendant contended, w hether it was to be regarded only in the nature of s penalty. The learned serjeant w;as of opinion that the plaintiffwas entitled to recover the full sum of 2,5001. as *quidated damages, but, in c.ase the Court should be of a different opinion, the jury were directed to find the amount of damages which the plaintiff had really sustained by the defendant's breaches of covenant. That Vwas estimated at the sum of 1,2001., and leave was given the defendant to move this Court to reduce the damages to that amount. The learned counsel did not avail himself of the leave reserved, but now moved for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection and that the verdict wvas against the evidence. Lord CxatrpEaL said the learned counsel might take a rnle on the question whether the money might be recovered as liqmdated damages; on the other question the Court would consult the learned serjeant. LIT RE LOCKE. Mr. Serjeant ATKD;sox moved for a rule to show cause why afi. fa., -which had been executed on the goods of the applicants, should not be set aside and the moneypaid returned to them. An application had been mnade to this court for a mnndamits to the churchwardens of St. Faith's Winchester, to proceed to an election of new churchwardens. The application wv-as made on the affidavit of Robert and Charles Locke, but the real prosecutor 'Was a clergyman named Holloway. In Hilary Term last the rule -was discharged, with costs to be paid by the prosecutors. The costs were taxed at the sum of 201. odd, and a threat wvas made to proceed against the applicants as the prosecutors. An application .vas then made to Mr. Justice Crompton at chambers to stay proceedings, upon an aflidaxit made by the Lockes, in which they stated they were not the prosecutors, that they had not retained the attorney, and that all they had done was, at the request of the Rev. Mr. Holloway, to make an affidavit of the facts which were -within their knowledge. The learned judge intimated an opinlion that Mr. HoUoway was the real prosecutor; but, notwithstanding this, the defendants had issued aJi. fro., and seized the applicant's goods, The money v.-as then p.aid. The present application wvas made, in order to have the proceedings set asilde and the money returned. The Question u-as, wyho was the prosecutor 9 The other side alleged that, as the rule was drawn up on the reading of the applicants' affidavit, and the name of Holloway did not appear on the face of the proceedings, they (the applicants) were the prosecutors. Lord CAI1PPELL.-The simple fact of their swearing an affidavit would not make them prosecutors. Mr. Justice Cro3srTos' &-id that when the case was before him the applicants had failed to satisfy him that they were not the prosecutors. TIE qUEES V. THE JUSTICES AT ST.FOPD. M1r. ScomvX;D moved for a rule calling upon two justices of Stafford to show cause why they should not sign a poorrate which had been duly made by the township of Hopton. The ground for the refusal was that the column in the rate-book headed " occupiers" was not filled up. It appeared from the statement made by the learned counsel that in the neighbourhood of Stafford there was a piece of land named Coton-field, which was divided into small allotments, held by poor tenants, burgesses of Saffor(l. As soon as these alotments were from time to time made, they wvere frequently underlet, so that it became isupossible to ascertain who were at the time the real occupiers. These facts were stated to the justices, who thining they had a discretion to exercise, refused to sign the rate. The ac t of the magistrates was, however, only uninsteriaL Besides, the overseers, in the verywords of the act of Parliament, " declare thsat the several particulars specified in the respective columns of the above rate are true and correct, so far as we have been able to ascertain them, to which end we have used our best endeavours." If it were said the overseers might have ascertained the names of the occupiers, that was matter for appeal at the sessions. The rates had usually been paid by the ovners, and the names of the owners were there. Iord CAM31BELL said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. roWLEs V. =rynm In this case a rule had been granted to enter the verdict for the defendant. The question raised was whether the defendant, the registered owner of a cab, was liable for the negligent act of the cabman, who had hired the cab and horses for the day, upon the terms that he should pay 14s. 6d. per day on taking the cab out, the defendant undertakidng to provide the horses with corn. 3fr. H. kilLL, Q.C., now showed cause against the rule, which was supported by lMr. Bovm~, Q.C., and M1r. Iord CA3MBELL said the Court would consider their decision. CHOrSOl V. BARr0so. In this case a rule had been granted to enter the verdict for the plaintiff on one of the issues. The question was whether the defendant was liable for the negligence of a man named Walter, under these circumstances :-The defendant was an engineer in the service of the SouthEastern Railway Company, and when engaged in the discharge of his duties lie was in the habit of using a fIv. The ty was drawn by a horse hired of a person named Wise, whose servant also acted as driver. The driver, when employed by the defendant, wore his livery. It anppeared at the trial, which took place before 3Mr. Justice Bile towards the end of last term, that on the day in question the groom went to the defendant and asked if he wanted his carriage. He was told that he did not. The groom then said that if the defendant had no objection he (the groom) would take the horse out for an airing, and give his sister a drive. The defendant said he had no objection. -Upon this the groom took out the horse and fly, and before he returned home at night he came in collision with one of the plaintiff's cabs and did the damage for which the present action was brought. The question was whether, under the circumstances, Walter could be considered at the time as the defendant's servant, so as to render the defendant responsible for his negligence. Hr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Phipson now showed cause against the rule, which was supported by 3Mr. hf. Chambers, _.C., andMr. Prentice. Lord Ct3iPBEuL said the question was whether the learned Judge (Mr. Justice Erie ought to have directed a verdict for the plaintifl on the issue raised hy the plea of " not possessed.' That depended on whether, when the accident happened, Walter was the servant of the defendant. It appeared that Walter was the servant of Wise, and he was onlythe servant of the defendant w,hen actually employed by him. Was he so employed at the time of the accident 9 He (Lord Campbell) thought be was not. The defendant made no objection to the groom's driving his wife and sister to MIaidstone, but he didnot employ him so to do; and he was t}erefore no more liable for what occurred than he would be for anything else done by Walter at any other time when not employed by him. The other Judges were of the same opinion. Rule discharged. NVI}oEZo V. NVESSTER. Mr. BoNra,, Q.C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant. The action was in ejectment for a forfeiture upon the ground of a breach of covenant in a lease. The covenant was that the lessee should not use the house as a shop or publichouse, or for " any public trade or busiuess," but that it should be occupied as a " private dwellinghouse only." The defendant had opened a day school for young ladies, 20 in number, between the ages of 6 and 12 years, and the question was whether this use of the house amounted to a breach of covenant, so as to incur a forfeiture of the lease. The action as brought by the lessee against the defendant as underlessee, under the apprehension that if the plaintiff did not bring the action the lessor would do so. T,Ord CAaIPI5EL said that, as the question might occur again, it would he well that the point should be decided by the Court after hearing both sides. LIKvnGSvO.NE V. P;ALLT AIT)D CO. Mr. BOmnL, Q.C., moved in this case, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendants. The action was brought to recover damages for the breach of a contract for the sale of corn; and the breach on which the plaintiff relied was that the defendant had refused to refer to arbitration a difference which he alleged had arisen betwveen the parties as to the contract, and which difference should it arise, the defendant had agreed to refer to arbitration. There-was also a question raised as to the measure of damages. Lord IAPB5ELL said the learned counsel might take a rule, BATI COURT. (SUH2293g (d Nis! P2riUs before Mr. JustiCe COLEItIDCE.) The Court was engaged to-day in trying a part-heard case, in which the question was whether the party who had obtained provisions, &c., for a ship had been duly authorized by the ov ner.

The plaintiff was the agent of a gentleman at Gottenburg named Roose, and the question turned on the construchon of a bought and sold note, the terms of the bought note being "Bought through Mr. Koppy of Mr. Reese," and signed by the plaintiff; and the sold note was exprsse tobe siged n ~hal ofMr.Rouse, of Gottenburg"Uertob thesefacts the lfearneMd counsel contended that the contract was byMr. Rouse, ^and not by the de- Rule isisl granted. ARNOLD AN)D ANOTHER V. ALCOC. This was an action tried at the Guildhall before the Lord Chief-Justice. M1r. ML S3ssITnjQ.C., now moved for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was brought by the charterers of a ship called the Mehemet Ali for not shipping a large vacuum vat for Batavia according to contract. It was found the vat could not be got through the hatchways of the ship without taLing the combings off. It had been agreed to take the vat for 451., the shippers to be at the expense of disturbing the deck. The defendants under this contract refused to take the vat, unless the shippers would replace the combings with new ones, the cost of which would be 30. This the plaintiffs refuised to do, and sent the vat by another vessel, at a cost of 1701., and sought to recover the difference. The CouRT saw no reason, on the evidence, to be dissatisfied with the verdict. Rule refused. COOPER V. CHIAPMA2 This was an action tried at Stafford before MTr. Justice Cresswell, in which the plaintiff was nonsuited. Mr. SEATIG, Q. C., now mioved, on affidavits, for a new trial. The action wvas against the Sheriff for a false return of ullae 6ono, the officer, as alleged, having made no efforts to execute his writ and make a levy. For the defendant the officer, named Lucas, was called, and swore he had been four times 15 miles to the house in which the levy was to be made, and had kept guard over it, without being able to get in. Iu answer it was said the furniture had been removed one Sunday night after the writ was issuied, and that the officer's visits had been after the furniture was removed. Rule nisi granted. HURST V. MSRORN. This was au action tried at the Guildhall before the Lord Chief-Justice, in which a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 200?. Mr. WsILDE, Q.C., now moved for a new trial, on the grounds of midirection and improper rejection of evidence. ,£he action was brought on a eharter.party. The plaintiff was the owner of a ship chartered to go to Limerick for a gram cargo on the 22d of September, 1854. The vesselwas first to sail to Ravre and then to Limerick to take in a grain cargo. The vessel was to be of the class Al. Owing to stress of weather the vessel did not reach Mavre till the 26th of December, and on her voyage thence she -was obliged to put into Rnmsgate for repairs, where she losther class by effluxion of time, and was afterwards obliged by stress of weather to put into Plymouth and Falmouth, and she did not arrive at Limerick till the 31th of April ready for her cargo, when the defendant refused to load one. The evidence proposed to be given was that the custom of the port of Limerick was to load grain cargoes in the winter, and that both parties knew this; that the ordinary passage was 50 days, and - the vessel had taken 202 days; and that, regard being had to the nature of the trade, the defendant was not liable for refusing to load the vessel under the circumstances. It was also submitted that at the time she arrived at Limerick she did not fulfil the conditions of the charter-party, as she was no longer classed as A 1, and that the shipowner was bound to keep the vessel in the condition in which she was described in the contract, which he could easily have done. The CornT thought the warranty of the class of the vessel had reference to the time at which the charter- party was made, and that the evidence tendered was rightly rejected. Riule refused. IlMUntN V. REEVE. This was an action tried before the Lord Chief-Justice at Norvich, in which the plaintiff was nonsuited, with leave to move to enter the verdict for 301. Mr. OiLuLEY now moved pursuant to the leave reserved. The plaintiff had agreed to sell a mdare and foal and t-o keep them till Michaelmas for thle defendanit, and also to keep another mare and foal of the defendant's tRll Michaelmasfor 301. At Michaelmas the defendant took the mares and foals away, his OWl mare and foal having been agisted on the plaintiff's land. The contract was not in wvriting, and the defendant, under the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds, contended that he was not liable, the contract being for chattels above i01. in value. The learned counsel now submitted that there had been a part acceptance by the buyer w6ithin the statute, he having taken six months' grass away on the backs and ribs of his mare and foal. Rule 71iSi granted. BASTTERSHALL V. REED. This was an action tried at Exeter before Mr. Justice Crowder, when a verdict was found for the defendant. Mr. COLLIsR, Q.C., noW moved for a new trial, on the ground of nisdirection. The action was brought by a reversioner of certain premises for obstructing a right of way, to which an unitnterrnpted user of 40 years was setup iunder the statute. For ten years, from 1843 to 1853, there had been a unity of possession, which the learned counsel contended did not affect the operation of the statute. He also submitted that the reversioner was entitled to recover substantial damages for the injury to his reversion. The OURTthouht hereough tobe no rule on the first point, as the plaintaff hahdrha°d gnoenjoyment eas of right for 40 years next preceding his complaint under the statute;but granted a rule on the second point. RLule ftise granted. ROLT V. COUSINS. This was an action tried before Mr. Baron Alde?son at the last assizes for Surrey, when a verdict was found for the defendant, with leave reserved to move to enter the verdict for the plaintiff for 1531. 3Mr. BOVILL, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. C. Pollock), now moved accordingly. The action was brought on a guarantee to pay the amount on consideration of forbearance till a certain time. Before the time elapsed the plaintiff issued a writ, whicb, however, was not proceeded with, and it was contended that the plaintiff had performed his part of the agreement, and was entitled to recover. Rule ssisi granted.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER, THRSDAY, AprBIl17. DERBY V. OTJSLFTEY. (Sittinoz in, Banco.) This was an action of libel, which was fully reported by us on the occasion of its trial at Liverpool before Mr. Justice Wifles, when a verdict passed for the plaintiff with 4:5t. damages. Mlr. KNrEALY now moved for a new trial on four grounds. He first complained that certain evidence hadbeen improperly rejected; secondly, that the learned Judge had improperly interfered with the learned counsel in his ad. dress to the jury for the defendant, by refusing to allow him to read and explain to the jury certain documents without proving them; thirdly, thathe had misdirected the jury; and, fourthiy, that he had adopted a tone in his susmning up which was calculated improperly to infuencethejnry against the defendant, and had over minutely criticized his (lr. Kenealy's) speech and refuted all his arguments. In support of these various grounds the learned counsel addressed the Court at considerable length to-day. At the close of his argument, The CTxF BARiox, on behalf of the Court, gave judgment, refusing the rule on all grounds. Rule refpsed. SiUings at M.Ti*Prt^, before Mr. Barois MARTLN ard a C0onmon Jury.) G}OR;N V. LUCIUNG. This was an actiou brought by the plaintiff, an attorney, against the defendant, a house agent carrying on business near Portman-square, to recover a stun of 501. alleged to have been received to the plaintiiWs use by the defendant. The defendant pleaded a set-off. It appeared that the plaintiff, having some premises to let in Oxford-street and in the Fulham-road, had requested the defendant to let them for him. Theplantiffdid not hear from the defendant for some ime, and let the Oxfordstreet house himself. It them turned out that the defendant had previously let them, but did not communicate that fact to the plaintiff until a fortnight afterwards. A sum of 601. had been placed in his hands as deposit by the parties to -whom he had let them, and he now refused to deliver up that sum. The defence was that the 501. which the defendant had received he had kept as his commission for letting the houses, for hc contended that, havina let the Oxford-street house previously to the plaintiff letting it, he was entitled to his commission upon that house. Lr. O'MIalley andlfr. Joyce appeared for the plaintiff and M\r. Hawkins for the defendant. After some consultation it was agreed to refer the matter to his Lordship's decision. Mr. Baron A.P.Tsr said he should not allow the defendant's claim for commission upon the Oxford-street house, but he thought the plaintiff ou-ht to pay the M01. which the defendant claimed upon the Fuham-road house. He would now state that, in his opinion, if a house agent had a house placed in his hands for the purpose of letting it, he was actmig as the agent of the L~udlor, and was bound to commiunicate everythiag that occurred with respect to that house immediately to his principaL. If a house-agent kept back 'anything from his employer he had considerable doubt vwhether that would not be a forfeiture of the commi-ssion.
ADMIRALTY COURT. THURSDXA. AIRm 17. 'r1. VTVT-RI,N_ (Before Dr. LUSTNqGTON.) This was a suit promoted by the late brigantine H[enry, of the burden of S9 tons, againmt the steanvessel Vivid, to recover for a total loss, occasioned by a collision between them atll 30 p.m. on the Ulth of August last, in Doverroads. The brigantine, coal-laden, was bound from Newcastle to Rouen, and had brought up opposite to the entrance to Dover harbour. According to her account, she immediately hoisted a signal-lantern under the boom of the foresail, about feur feet on the starboard side of the forems.t and about 20 feet abovethe bulwarks. There was also a bright fire in an open caboos in the galley. The night, although dark, was clear. The steamer, of the burden of 300 tons, with engines of 120-horsepower, carrying the mails froml)over toCalais, was seen rapidlyapproaching and was instantlyhailed, but no notice was taken, and the steatmer struck the brigantine with such violence that she filled, and the master, mate, and a boy were drowned. The steamer, as alleged, was proceeding at the rate of 12 miles an hour. The steamer pleaded in her defence that she was under a contract wlith Hrer Majesty'sGovermnent to convey the mails at the rate of 13 miles an hour; that at the time in question she saw ahlmost under her bows a dark obj ect, whereupon the master caled out " Hard aport" two or three times "Ease her," "Stop her," and "Turn her asternm" but, notwithstanding such orders were instantl obeyed, she ran into the brigantine. She contended that anterior to and at the time of the collision the brigantine had no light exhibited so as to be visible to any one on board the steamer, and that, if she had a light, it was not suspended in accordance with the Admiralty regulations. Dr. JENxxxa and Dr. BAYFOnD were heard for the brigantine; Dr. HAoGGARD and Dr. RoBERTsoN for the steamer. The learned JUDGE, having conferred with the Elder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, said they were of opinion that the brigantine had a suitable light hoisted, and was not in an improper anchorage; that the exhibition of the light on board the brigantine, as proved by the evidence, was as visible to the steamer so approaching her as if it had been hoisted at the masthead; that the collision was not occasioned by the departure from the rules of the Admiralty, and that no blame attached to her. Theywere of opinion that the collision was imputable to the fault of the steamer, and he thought so toe. SWEDISH IRON. A quanitity of Swedish iron was taken out of a vessel wrecked in the Baltic by the boats of Her M1ajesty's ship 1Falcon, and sent to this country for adjudication. The COURT condemned it.

(Before Mr. Commistioei P .T.rTPn 1 Ihis imsolvent applied under the Protection Act, and a peison named Barnard, who described himself as formerly a jockey, appeared to oppose. Mrr. l)enney was counsel for the insolvent. It was alleged by Barnard that the insolvent owed him upwards of 2,00019 hut the insolventdenied that he owed him anything; on the contrary, he considered that he owed him 2001. lMr. Dim~ said the alleged claim by Barnard was mental delusion. Mr. Commissioner Pnmsts, after a long discussion, referred the matter to the Registrar, and adjourned the case to Monday. BY RE SARAH MEDLEY Mr. DOVSE applied for the assistance of the Court under peculiar circunmstances. In 1849 the insolvent was discharged under the act, having previously deposited a policy on her life in the Law Life-office, with a Mr. Beresford, for o00I., owing him 401. He had paid 1501. as premiums, and was now tired out. The debt, with interest, was 2071. 6s. 8d.

POLICO. MLuS1O"-nOtsxE.-George Frederick Lillicrap, charged with having removed, concealed, and embezzled certain goods, being par' of his estate as a bankrupt, to the value of 101. and upwzards, with intent to defraud his creditors, was brought-before Sir HxRY~~ MUGGEBGIIE for final examinat.ion. Mr. Pasryappearedfortheprosecution,andra. Humj hries for the defence. The former evidence was read by 31r. Goodman, the chief clerk, and copies of the evidence given before Mr. Goulburn, the Comtnissioner of Bankruptcy, were handed in by Mr. Dollman, the solicitor to the assignees. lIr. Dollman said, that at the commencement of the examination before the Commissioner the prisoner swore that he did not remove any goods, and in the latter part he admitted that he did remove some of the goods. Some of the goods so removed had been subsequently recovered by the assignees. Alfred .Tacobs, clerk to Mr. NSicholson, of Basinghallstreet, official assignee, produced the booksof the bankrupt. Some additional documentary evidence was produced. A broker to the Bankruptcy Court said, he took an inventory of the goods in the bankrupt's shop and house, and he also took an account of a quantity of pepper, cloves, and other grocery goods at the house of a Mr. Green. Mr.flurn, accountant, of Basiughall-street, said he prepared a balance-sheet at the instance of the prisoner, under the bankruptcy. He did not prepare the additional balancesheet. He declined to do so. Having observed several alterations, he asked the prisoner what he had been doing with the accounts, and told him he had upset all the statements, and he (witness) must decline going any further into them. Mr. Humphnies (for the prisoner) said, he did not consider it necessary to make any observations upon this case, as he knew the Alderman would not decide upon the point of law on which it would be necessary to make objections. The prisoner, upon being asked whether he wished to say anything in his defence, said, "I leave it-in the hands of mny solicitor." The prisoner was then committed for trial, but was admitted to bail. GUILDHALL.-Richard Reynolds, a young man of respectable appetarance, was charged wzith obtaining two photographic lenses, value801., from Mrr. Htorne, of Newgatestreet, by means of flse pretences, and also 'with robbing luis last two employers of photographic lenses. The prisoner declined making any defence, and Alderman CARTER committed hiin for trial on oae charge of obtaining goods by false pretences, and on two charges on robbing his employers. John O'Brien was charged with assaulting complainant and biting his thuasb nearly off. Dennis Sullivan said, he was coming down Union-court, Holborn, last night, when he was set upon by the prisoner and several others. They knocked him down and beat andl kicked him about the body until he was bruised all over. The prisoner then got his thumb in his mouth, and bit right th-ough the nail, indeed it was bitten nearly off. He held it between his teeth for nearly a quarter of an hour, and it' Was with the greatest difficulty he was induced to let go. He could produce no witness, because they had all been deterred by threats from coming forwvard to give evidence agmainstthe prisoner. There was a man outside the door wao atened himn if he pressed the charge. Aidernan CuABTER said, the prisoner had acted in a most brutal and unmanly manner, and to mark his sense of his condact he should infiict the full penalty of 5l., or two months' imprisomuent. MAR.wBSON.-George King,police-constable 61 F, Wilh'am Hawvking Smith, Alfred Brocldey, William Castles, David Thomas, and Joseph Sea'ey, all of whom were in the first instance charged with having been concerned ingstealing property to the value of 4001. from the goods station of tho London and North Western Railway, Camden-town, were again brought up before M1r. Loxr. The whole of the accused parties were at the period of the robbery in- the employ of Messrs. Baxendale, the well-known carriers, trading under the name of Pickford and Co. * From what transpired upon ithe first examination' it apreared that on the 18th of June, 1854, gold watches, 36 in number, together with a quantity of plate andother articles, were sent by different parties to Mfessrs. Chawner, Hosier-lane. They were packed up in a box, which was sent in the usual way to se ood station of the railway. It was addressed to Messrs. 3lirhead, Glasgow. None of the istolen property had been found. One of the prisoners (Smith) was admitted as awitness against the others, and he entered into details as to the prot'erty being disposed of by King to a man named Mayes, living in King s-road, Camden-town. He further set forth that he hadreceived 101., and that sums of different amounts were paid to the other Drisoners. Mr. Swan now attended, ns before, for the prosecution Mr.Herirg orKing, Mr. Lewis for Castles and Brockley, Mr. Herrin~ for anad IIr. Roinson for Thomas and Sealey. The whole of the evidence taken upon the previous Tharsday was read over by the chief clerk,lMr. Fel Smith (cross-examined by Mr. Lewis).-Ican,tsayhow many robberies I have beenl concerned in before; it might be a dozen. I expect to he set free by giving my evidence to-day. I have been concerned in a robbery of silks and in other robheries. I was not particular what I took. Mr. HerringRs cross-examination elicited from Smith admiions similar to those which he had made to Mr. Mr. Solomon, who appeared on the part of Smith (the vvitness), raid, in reference to remarks made by the solicitors for the defence, that he (Smith) was, as he firmly believed, a truthful witness in respect to the disposal of the property and the sharing of the proceeds thereo£. The accused were remanded till Thursday next all of them, with the exception of Smith, being allowed to give good bail for their re-appearance on that day. WMs.rrNsTEP.-Henry Charnell, late butler in the establishment of Mr. HIL. Fisher, was brought up for re-examination, charged with stealing his master's plate, value 3001. In addition to the former testimony, which has already been detailed, Thomas MWGavin, of 27, D'Oyly-street,' Chelsea, was examined. He stated he had beenin the habit of jobbing at the house, and was there on the evening before the robbery from 6 o'clock to 10, daring which time he did not notice anything particular; but just before he came away a young man, who he was told was a butler in the neighbourhood, came to the house to see the prisoner, and was asked into the* pantry, which was his private room, where he saw anv friends who might call. The key of the plate-closet was generally kept in the door when it was open, and he saw it open that night. The plate used at dinner was washed in the ordinary way and put in the closet in a tray. It Was not the practice to put it in the chest, and he did not see it pat in the chest that night, nor could he say whether the prisoner locked the door. When witness came away the young man whom he had seen at the house two or three times before was in the pantry with the prisoner, but he saw nothing in the conduct of either to create any suspicion. The mode of access to the house by servants or their friends was to go down the area and ring the bel, and the area door was opened fros awithin. The area gate wasunlockedwhen witness went out. In cross-exarination by Mr. Wilding, solicitor for the prisoner, witness reated that he saw nothing whatever to excite suspicion while there on. the night before the robbery. On the question beig put, whether the area door could not be unlocked from the outside, the police replied in the afBlrmative. Mr. PEYtrEn said, he should remand the prisoner for a week. Mr. Wilding addressed the magistrate for the prisoner, nrging that he bore an irreproachable character, that he had never attempted to leave the house after the discovery of the robbery, but informed his master of it. HIe (Mr. Wilding) thought the case a very slight one against the prisoner. - MEr. PAInTrER observed, that he was far from thinling it slight, and had made up his mindto commit the prisoner for trial at the Central Criminal Court. Mr. Wilding said, he would venture an opinion very confidently that the prisoner would be acquitted. He then solicited that bail might be taken for the prisoner. MWr. PASYNTEsX refused, on the groand that thiere was every reason to believe that other parties were implicated with him. Prisoner was remanded for a week. Georgina Chatton, a tall, powerful woman, 24 years of age, wife of the proprietorof a coffeehouse at 5, MIiddlerow, south, Knightsbridge, was finally examined, charged with feloniously assaulting and wounding her husband with This is the third time the accused has been charged with bratal attacks upon her husband. On the first occasion, in 1854, she wounded him desperately with a pair of firetongs, and was committed for trial from the Hammersmith Policecourt, but subsequently begged off by her husband at the Old Bailey. IaJunrelast she was again committed from this court for stabbing him with a huge knife, and afterwards beating himu wth her fists while he was bleeding from the wounds she had infiicted. On that occasion, owing to his reconimendation to mercy, she only received six months' imprisonment, which expired on the 1st of last January, when he attended at the prison and took her home again. On the 26th ult. she quarrelled with her sister and struck her, when, upon her husband interposing mnd endeavonring to pacify her, she seized the poker and inflictedtwo desperate oweupon his head with it. He fell bleeding into the arms of a m an attracted by his cries, and prisoner, who was immediately captured, has been since then from time to time remanded, owing to her husband's life being in danger. Mr. Henry John Strong, house surgeon, of St. George's Hospital, said that Mr. Chatton had been suffering from a very serious incised scalp wound in the front of the head, and that the blood was infused on the back part from another blow. He had been in great danger. Prisoner, who made lio reply to the charge, was committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court. WVOtESsSTR-EET.---r. George Fullwell, a gentlemanlylooking man of 35, described as having flourmills at Chelsea and a wharf in the City-road, was charged before Mr. HMm- aL, at the instance of the parish authorities of St. Luke's, ith feloniously receiving a quantity of broken stones, he well knowing them to have been stolen. Mr. Albury, for the Parish vestry-clerk, said that in October last the St. Lukefs authorities delivered from their yard to one of the servants of the parish contractor, Mr. Dodd, a quantity of broken stones for repairing the parisl roads. These stones were worth between 12s. and 13s. per load, but it was subseqnently ascertained that the defendant, who had a wharf in the City-road, had purchased them at about 3s. 6d. These circumstances came to the knowledge of tlhe parish through the medium of a man named Atkinson, a servant of the defendant, who had been indicted on Wednesday at the MIiddlesex Sessions for robbing his master, convicted, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. It then appeared that the driver who received these stones from tIme parish for repair of the roads had taken them to the defendant's wharf, where they were shot by direction of another servant of Mr. Dodd, named Johnson, who had suddenly absented himself and was not to be found, but it would seem that there were altogether about eight loads of these stones discovered at the wharf, and the parish therefore felt themselves compelled by their duty to prosecute. He should at present content himself by calling evidence to prove the delivery at the wharf of a certain quantity of these stolen stones, and on another occasion adduce the evidence of two persons, one of whom would prove the carriage there of some of them, while the second would depose to seeing the defendant pay 10s. Gd. for them. Twvo men named Newman and King were then called, the first of whom proved delivering to the contractor's men, on the 5th and 6th of October last 15 yards of broken pebbles, and th!at on going to the defendant's wharf that (Thursday) mormng he saw about four or five loads of stones us a heap. of a precisely sim.ilar character and quality. The second man proved the delivery there, by order of Johnson, of a quantity of stones, but said he did not see defendant, and received no moncy for them, il. Wontner, for the defendant, complained of a great want of truth and suppression of facts in the case. The defendant was a highly respectable nerson, against whom these proceedings should never have been instituted. The facts were, the defendant had a man narned Atkinson in his employment as foreman at his wharf in the City-road, whence he was removed to the other premises at Chelsea, but it had latterly been discovered that he, in conjunction with another man, bad been conunitting robberies upon the defendant, and he was therefore given into custody, and indicted and convicted as before described. It was then that the defendant became avare that these stolen stones were in his possession, or rather at his wharf, Atkinson coolly observing to him, -" There are stones at your wharf wluch have been stolen, and you shall hear niore about' them." The defendant immediately gave directions that not a stone should be moved, and at once forwarded information of the fact to the parish authorities. This conduct was honest and straightforward enough, and the way in which his ciient became possessed of the property was, that his wharf became very much out of repair, and he therefore gave orders to his men to purclhase stones and rubble to fil up the holes, but had not the slightest idea that the materials so obtained had not been obtained honestly. Mr.t Albury protested against there being the remotest idea'of suppressing anything on thepartof theparish, either one way orthe other, and they regretted they had such a public duty to perform. Some further remarks of a somewhat similar character were also exchanged between the learned gentlemen, which wereterminated by the magistrate remanding the case for a week, and ordering the defendant to put in his recognisances to answer the charge. SOUTrHWAVR.-After tho trifling night clages had been disposed of, Mr. Edwin, the chief clerk, reportea to Mr. A'BECKETT the escape of afemale prisonerftrpn the custody of Downe, the gaoler of the-police court, in a very mysteriousmanner. He informed his worship that on the previous afternoon a womanljwell kmown to the authorities as an omnibus thief, and connected with a notorious gang of housebreakers, named Mary An Leonard, alias Gardiner was brought before t r. Combe, chared vnth being at large before the expiration of the term for which she was sentenced to be kept ain penal seritude. She was tried on the 2Oth of august for stealing a portemonnaie contining' Of. 10s. from a Iady namned Sully in an Atlas om3iibus, and, being found guilty, sentenced to six years' penal servtude, former convctions thavi beenathen proved against her for similfr robberies. She was confined in Eorsemonger-laneG Gaol, to remain unxtl notice for her removal to a penal prison should be forwarded from the Home-office. Prir to that, however, on the 19th of t ebruary she contrived to escape from that gaol in a very mysterious nanner, and evaded the sathorities until Monday night last, wvhen she was apprehended at Liverpool, just, as she was about t sail itE a man to the IUnited States, they bomh havcng paid the.r passage. Inspector Murphy hrought her tothis court, when satisfactoay evidence hfaving been taken dofn, showfing that she was the person who escaped from ieorsemonger-lane Gaol, hmr. Comb committed her for tria at the nexb Old aley Sessions. She was then remnoved by Downe, the gaoler, who locked her up in one of the cells at the rear of the court, to wcit till the van arived to convey her tohlergate. She, however, managed to escape again, aad was still out of custody. Mr. Ae BEccour asked how it was she contrived to escape ftrom the ceUs of the court 9 The mag,istrate was informed that shortly before 5 o'clock some of her friends called (as is usua;) to see her, anbythey prevailed on the gaoler to allow them to have their interviewv in his room, instead of standing innthe passage oltside the ceDs. The gaoler consented and brought her into his room, which is situate between the police court and the ,entrance to the celLs, where two or three women and a nale friend conversed with her. During that time Dobane was called into court sudderay on busiess, but prior to leaving them he carefully locked the door leading to the cels, and took the keys with hin. On his return to his room, after being absent hardly moro than a moment, he vas much larmed at fiundeg that the prisoner and all her friends were gone. She must have passed through the. court,which was wather crowided at the fime, disgwused by her friends, as they were seen to leave rather suddenlyy b our reporter and one of the ushers; but it was not in the least suspected that the prisoner was among them. As soon as the escape was discovered an alarm was raised, and offlcers were sent in every direction; but the prisoner's friends had so wvell plannediier escape that no ClU corld be obtained as to the route she had taken. Mndr. atBEC a rr directed a report of the circumstances to be forwarded to the Secretary of State, so that means might be immediately adopted to recapture her. frowne the gaoler, is a very careful and steadv manr , and, aths is is consistent with his duty, humane totards the prisoners under his care. TXhe prisoner is well k;nov.n to the pollee as an e.xpert thief. She was taken into custody a feea years ago, with several other notorious characters, for a robbery at a jeweller and silversmith's in the Strand, but discharged,r there not being sufiicieat evidence against her. Shefwas bseveraltimes aftervards in custody for similar robberies and for robbing ladies in omnibuses. She was sery successfrl in those robberies for a longtime, andwas solassisted by hef companions in effeCopndq ick changes in her attire, after commithigthose depree ti ofs, that for a long time she r ecapd. hehad, however, been twice tried and convicted, and at last her companions and her ow.n daring have enabled her to escape from the law. It has since been ascertained that a few sears ago the same prisoner made her escape lfrom the cells at Marlborough-street Police Court, therefore this is the third time she has contrived to get away from custody, and evade the sentence of the law. nigtoxter.-Mrs. olizabeth Wright, a decent-looking young woman in widows weeds, appliedlto Mr. Eurol T for some assistance from the poorbow for herself and her children under circumstances of a very distressing character. The applicant said that her husband, who had formerly been a gertlaman's coachman, had been, employed for upwiards of two years at the Crsstal Palace as a timnekeeper over the workmnen, hut there bemng no further occasion for his services he in the beginning of December last joined thes ArmyAWorks Corps, under Sir JosephPaton, andseiled for the Crimea on thel9th of that month. Previous to his going her husband signed a document which entitled her to the payment of lSs. a-week, and this amount she regularly received ufto about five weeas since, when it. was hstopped by about 10 days after the cage of the money she received a letter from a frieno~ in- the Crimea, stating that her husband had been burnt to death on the night of the 17th of March, with about 17 or 1S others. while asleep in his tent, and this melancholy news was confirmed by a letter which she begged to hand to his worship for his perusal. The poor woman here handed to the Bench a letter, of which the followhing is a c6py:- "'Army WForks Corps-offlce, 18, :S;ew-street, " Spring-gardens, April 6. hehalizabeth Wright,-I am directed by Sir Joseph maxton to commnlicate to you the sad intelligence which hehas just received from the Crimea, that John Wright has lost his life by a fire which broke out in the camp of the Commissariat branch of the rirmy Works Corps at Eadikoi on the night of the 17th of Mareh last.

In reply to the questions of MEr. ELLIOTI, The applicant said, she resided at 7, Roiemary-terrace, Peckbam; that she had two children living. (little girls, the one five and thze other two years of age, and expected athir;lin a short time. She also said that, having received nothing for nearly five weeks,-her means were quite exhausted and she scarcely knew what to do. MIr. liLo'rr deeply commziserated her unfortunaate situation, and ordered her a sovereign from the poorbox for her imnmediate necessities, a kidness for which the poor woman expressed her gratitude..-

THEEO CRMEAYV BOARD OF IYQUIRY. Among the titlcd persons present nt the meeting of the board yesterdy were the Duke of Cambridge, Viscounl Chelsea, Lord Claud Hamilton, and Lord Elcho. Throughout the proceedings the lady visitors applied themselves to their needles more industriously than ever; and various tlaborate patterms in fancy werk, and ingenious devices for consuming silk, patience, and time wvere "advanced a stage" under the astonished eyesof the Court. Lord Lucan was briefyrexamined by Colonel Tulloch.-In answer to questions pat to him, his lordship stated that, in taking up the Con-isisariat sup plies eachl man had two horses-one to carry-himself and the other to carry the provisions. Unquestienably this doubled the numnber of the hones required -for the service, but for the dragoons to have walked this -distance, instead of riding, so as to save the labour of the horses, would, in his opiniioni, I.-ve been rost improper;at that time, in the thoeu condition of th1 roads; and-ho had stated so to Lord Raglanl. Colonel TffIloch said, he had no othtr wifcsses to<eull withz the' eseption of Colonel i'otticr, who was unablc to ho present, having been unexpectedly called away that nuorning,;t:aad the captain of a transport wessnl, which wsY, -espectedto atrire at Southampton on the 9tth. This wit- Cess bad. 'he believed, offered sailcloth, nulll had also "offered to put it lip. -Mnf.`lMder.-The Boeaz-&lbaing -been -so. good assto allowv arre an opportunity of repling to the -statelent made by Lord Lucan on Wcdnesdiv the '9th sigt., -respoe-ting the duties of the Commissariat, I would dbserve that on that occasion Lorl Lucan road several -etters Nthich had been addressed by hinm eithr to the Adjutant-General, the tQuartermaster-Ceneral, -or msyself, represelnting the foraging -of the cavalry; bu-t in no instance-did bisiordship read the *answers to those letters, and nny object -in addressing the $Roard at present is respeetfuilly to -protest against incomplete correspondenoe bela" adniltted as evidence to my prejudice. I feel nssared aba Lord -Lucanl lhs no wvish to prejudice my case, hut -sueh must inevitably be the consequence if the evidence lis alowed to-stand as at present. I w.ould therefore snbnit'for'the consideration of the board, either that these letters be not-admitted as evidence, or that Lord Lucan be required to put in the-answers to thein. I have teen obliged, by the rnIes of the service, to leave my official papers in the Crhnea in order -to cnable my successor to carryon the public business; otherwise I soight at afuture opportunity lay beiore the Board the answcrs to the letters quoted by Lord Lucan; but his lordship has, no doubt, all his papers -with him-in England, and it may be deemed by the Board msore - convenient that he should furnish tlis infomantion-at tlle present stage of the proceedings. Although mny chief object in appearing before the Bolrd is, to make this protest, -the Board may perhaps think it desirable that I should,-on the-preseust occasion, make any further observations I may -have to offer on Lord Lucan's statement, otherwise it midst be necessary to detain his lordship till the close of tie proceedings. Not having my papersvwith mc, as I'beforestated, I anm unable to follonw Lord Lucan's observations'in all their details, and must confine myself, for the most part, to general remarks. Lord Lucan, no doubt, made-frequent representations at different stages of the military operations to Lord Raglan respecting the foragiugof the cavalry; but in none of those cases which appearees to Lord iRaglan to be of a nature to call for inqtury, and in which explanatious were sulbmiitted to his lordship, was he of opinion that under the circumnstances in which fhe irregularities or deficiencies complained of -had taken place, blamne could be attributed to the Commissariat, and his lordship was the proper authority -to decide in the matter. Let Lord Lucan state in what instance, in answer to his representations, Lord Raglan decidedthat blame attached to the Comniissariat. As regards the foraging of that part of the heavy cavalry, amounting to about 900, which was more immediately under Lord Lucan's command while in Bulgaria, his lordslsip'scommunications with use related chiefly not to a defidency offorage, but to the inexperience of the Comumissariat officers, and to his desire to have a Divisional Commissariat officer- appointed to the cavalry. I was, therefore, very much surprised to hear his lordship state that his own Daggage animals were never allowed any rations at all, or very short-ones at this period. I have since obtained from the Audit-office the ration returns for Lord Lucan and the head-quarter cavalry staff, and I beg to lay them before the Board. -4n inspection of them wvill show that full rations of forage wvere issued both for the chargers and baggage adim-ils -belonging to himself and his staff tlhrou-hout the whole of the month of August, the period to which hiE lordship -more innnediately refers, it having been in that 3nonthtbatthe great fire occurred at Varns, by which a large quantity of corn we had in store was destroyed, and it became 'necessary in some degree to have recourse to the standing crops in the country. The returns are signed by one of his lordship's staff. With respect to Lord LucanWE reresentations about the Commissariat officers, I had no othersto give-him,'and I was unable to meet his wishes. His lordship therefore says truly that on the occasions of his communicating vith me-which were almost alNvays on this sabject-he left me dissatisfied, but dissatisfied on grounds which it was impossible for me to remove. It would have been no fault df mine had the Commissariat officers been without-experience, but in fact the cavalry was better off in this respect than othercorps. I will herereadan extract of aletterthat was written by me to the QuartermasterGeneral, an answer to a representation wvhich had been madebyLordLucan at a subsequent period on the subject-:- "-Head-quarters, Balalilava, Oct. 4, 1854. " Sir,-I-have the honour to return herewith the letter from the Earl of lucan, of the 29th ult,, enclosed in yours of the same date, respecting the manner in which the Light Brigade- of Cavalry has been supplied by the Coumnissariats officers -attached to it, and I transmit herewith an explanation -which I have received from Deputv Assistant Commissariat-General Crook-shank, the senior of thoseofficers, on tne subject. -In a separate report froiU Mr. Croolshank-, which has been submitted to the Commissioner of the Forces through the Adjutant-General, it is sshown that he has sever-been w-ithout provisions for the troops during the recent march; but that, owing to the lateness of the hour at 'which-they arrived on the ground, or the uncertainty of the position occupied by the brigade, they Were not always issued at tlse proper time; and that with respect to forage, the cavalry have seldom been wsithout their rations of corn, althongh-irregularly supplied. With reference to the Earl of Lucan's remarks on mny departmental arrangements, I 'would observe that it has never been customary to have a divisional Commissariat officer for the cavalry, owing -to the diffliculty of his superetending the supplies of a body of troops actig so widely apart; nevertheless, in compliance with Lord Lucan's wishes, I have - twice attesmpted to carry out this arrangement, but have on each occasion been thwarted by circumstances beyond my control, and I have now no disposable officer to appoint to the duty. And with respect to the qualifications of the two Commissariat officers at present serving with the Light Brigade, I can only observe that one of them, Mir. Crookshank, has been 10 years in the service, and has had much experience in every branch of Cosamissariat duty; and the other-, Mr. Siutherland, Isi years, nor are there any Commissariat officers with this army better suited by their activity and intelligence to act as cavalry commissioners. I amn, indeed, enabled lyipersonal obser-ation to bear testimony to their exertions -since-the entrance of the army in the Crimea, having seen them late and early making every effort to bring uptheir transport or to procure forage in the viiUa-es Ima.yadd-that-they supplied the brigade when at Xeni Bazaar and its neighbourhood without any assistance from the deplt, much to the satisfaction, I have understood, of Lord Cardigan. "I have, Pc., °" \fLIt3 FrILDEP, C. G." Lord Cardigan in his evidence before tlle Sebastopol Committee, says, "the Commissariat officers of my brigade eexertedtthemselves.to the utmost, and did all they possibly coudd. Indeed I never saw more zealous officers in my life." This rela.tes to theoLight Brigade. The JUnDGE-ADVOCATE said, that 'Mr. Filder could not read Lord Cardigan's - evidence.

Lord Iucan observed that hehad confined his statement respecting the cavalry- in Bulgaria entirely to what fell under-his own eyes. -lr. Xilder proceeded.-'The Commissariat officer attached to that part of the; heavy- brigade wlshicl was more imnme-dately nder Lord Lucan's orders had also had several yePars' experience in Commissariat duties. Lord Lucan zalludes to his aide-de-camp jhaving been appointed to assist in obtaining-forage, but I had attached to the Commissariat -officer for -this purpose.

Wbhen the armycame crowding into Varna and -eacauped in its neighbourhiood preparatory to embarking for the Crimnea, there may have been, as stated by Lord Lucan, So2e collision amon -the several C0omnissariat officers, antd itl searching for forage they may have for a few -days interfered with tide district viwich up to tlsat titne had beenSoraged by the c3valry; but -t to their galloping over the country, -which his Lordship makes snatter of complaint, I should have considerdi it a proof of their zseal and activity, mather than, oaf their incompetency. Lord Lucan certainly prop^,osed to sae, as he states, that a enuxb;sum price sisould be fixed for-ss-pplies, but I did not grpew^ith his lordshtip on~4hat point. I have never known 21 Mfxmv¢sls prnce tebe fiSxeC, bal t lt hai-beea evaded in somie weay or other. Besides, the Commissariat officers attached to the troops while i'a the neighbourhood.of Varna made no purchases but of forage. Then,with respeet to the foraging of the Light Cavalry Brigade Iwd Cardignn, on his arrival at Varnaz, to embarlk f6rthe Crimea, reported to Lord Rag- lan -that Ate was satisfied with ';ie maner in which the Coma-issariat duties had-een-pegFormed whiffle the Light Brigade had been in front, which, in fact, embraced the whole of th e tim e it had been inBuigari-. Iiappened to be resent when a Lord Cardigan maade this report to Lord Rag- ran, andI must suppose ie made the thme a-ee.ort to lord lucan. The herses, indeed, withthee x-eptionof that proportion of them which had been enployed in-the reconnais- sance to the Dobrudscha,were consideredhy milita-y mesn to be in high condition; and Lord Lucan now states -that there was not much diference between the condition of.th a Light Cavalry (excluding from the comparison DobrndscszaLorses) amd that of the heavy cavalry, which had been umder his insmediate command. The inference is, therefore , tbattShe latter could not have been badly foraged. The sethoriiod ration may, as stated by Lord Lucan, hav-e hbase-a n insla- fiiesnt one; but then his lordship w as President of thg Board which recommended it. There now remrains only ta ;5e noticed the two beavy regiments wlich had been statij,ned at Devna under the command of G:-eneral Scarlett. LIrr Lucan allows that General Scarlett -was nlt dissatisfied -±da the manner in -which they had been foraged, Lo& Lucan.-On the contrary, I stated that General ScarlV:h was not well satisfied. AMr. Yilder.-These observations embrace the whole of the perio4 dur8ig w hich the army was in Bulgaria u n 1i lsey -emrarlced for the C rinea. Lord Luc;aanseenis ; t,atflbut to mie the deficiency of forage which a 3s e,'porienced during the passage, but it l.e ~ p,gc ery f'- aae to observe to the Board that the >~0 2m'Q=sreneral has nothing wvhatever to do w ith feeding eE mP ora h~orse5 on board ghipi thlat duty belongs to the Admi-galty. Nor did Iever interfere. wit the reserve of sin- 'weeks' supply of forage which Lord Raglan had orderr4d to be retained on board the horse transports for the r acmber of horses they were capable of conveying. I did 'not, therefore, cause the deficiency that was experienccd oy the cavalry voyage. At a subsuq,uent period-that iv', after our loss by the storm of the t4ta of November-T certainly got that order rescinded; but when I sent for the hay to Eupatoria, where the horse transports had beems )-ing, it wzas found that they had been ordered, in commia with all other sailing transports, teo Constantinople; so that I did not get the bay. After landing in the Crimea thore was some irregularity and deficiency in the issues of forre dunng the march, and the representation which |lerd Lucan made to Lord RIaglan on the subject as referred to mne; but tic explanation of the tCommissariat officers attached to the cavalry, showing the quantity of corni that had been issued by them, and the cause of the deficienev, having been laid before Lord R.aglan, his lordship did not attribute blame to the Conamissariat underthe circumstances. Myreply was, I understood, communicated to Iord Lucan, and his lordship did not, so far as I am aware, question the correctness of the explanation. It was not possible, indeed, to invade the territory of a powerful enemy, and in the vresence, it may be said, of a large army, without experiencing inconvenience and difficulties with respect to supplies, especially in regard to so bulky an article as forage. The cause of the deficiency at the Alma, to which Lord Lucan mbre particularly adverts, wvas that a sufficient quantity of corn had not been landed at the time the cavalry came down to the beach for the whole of them to receive three days' rations, as had been intended. We were, of course, dependent upon the navy for landing stores on an enemy's coast; it was only surprising that they landed the quantity of supplies they did; but it was not always practicable, in the hurry attending suich a service, to arrange the disembarcation of the different articles in the proportionin which we requiredthem. Another cause of irregulanty in the issues both of provisions and forage tothe cavalry, during the march, was the lateness of the hour at which that force in particular took up its ground for the night, which depended not on previous arrangement which could, be communicated to the Conmmissaniat officers, but on the movements of the enemy. The troops, also, sometimes preferred relying on theConimissariat reaching the camp in time rather than take their rations in advance, according to the usage of the service. This was stated in the explanations which were submitted to Lord Raglan. The Board will perceive from this how prejudicial it might be to me if Lord Lucan were not to be required to produce the answers to the several letters he has guoted. Lord Lucan, in his great anxiety to have the cavalry m good condition, did not make allowances for other people's difficulties-he only sawv his owvn; but Lord RUaglan was in a position to know to difliculties on both sides, and that is why his Lordship's decisions were sometimes diflerent from what Lord Lucan expected. Lord Lucan allows that after the termination of the march-that is, from about the 26th or 27th of September up to the 28th of October-the horses of the cavalry were sufficiently foraged, and that at the battle of Balaklava, on the 25th of October, they were in better condition than they bad been at any fanner time; therefore, wvhatever they may have suffered before, the horses were in good condition at the commencement of the winter. In the neanwhile, a cargo of hay had arrived from England, but it was not alowed to be issued so long as forage could be found in the v illages, excepting to that psroportion of the Artillery wvhich was employed in dragging up the guns, and could not therefore forace for themselves. Lord Lucan says, referring to tSis period, that I fancy our authorities reduced the ration which had been fixed by General Orders. A memorandum which I submitted to Lord Raglan, and which, with the permission of the Board, I will now read, will show that Lord Lucan is tnder a misapprehension on the subject. But before readiiig it I should observe that this hay was a portion of a larger quantity which I had applied for long before it was known that the army would proceed to the Crimea. [ am not now certain what object I had in view in writing for it, but it arrived very opportunelv. Here is my representation to Lord Raglan, and his lordship's reply:- "A portion of the hay forwarded from England on say requisition having arrived, it would appear to be desirable under the circumstances of uncertainty in which the army is placed with respect to our obtaining any further supply of forage, that the ration should be reduced and the part of the force to which the hay is to be issued should be restricted. The whole quantity when received will amount to nearly 1,500,0001b., or 150,000 full rations of lO1b. each, or 250,000 rations at Glb. each, or 300,000 rations at 51b. each. Thse number of aninsals for which rations of forage will have to be provided cannot at present be ascert.ained, as they are daily arriving from Varna, but at the present time there are about 7,000 with the army. If full rations were to be issued to that number the hay would only last 20 days. It is for consideration, also, vwhethera portion of the hay may not be required for the horse transports, some of whlich havulnow, I believe, very little forage on board. "WIasLLAUE FILDEP7, C. G. "Ctommissariat, Balaklava, Oct. 9, 1854." "(Mlemorandum.) "Ido not know to wYhat extent the horse transports are still provided withforage. Captain Christie will probably be able to afford the required information upon this point. Horsesare apttolose theircondition,whenchbangingttheircoats in the autumn, and then they require plenty of food. The horses of the artillery, the cavalry, and the staff shouldhave the hay that has arrived. Six pounds are very insufficient, but, until more is received from England or Constantinople, it will heprudent to limit the ration to that quantity. " October 11, 1854."'" RAGLA-." The ration was for a few dan 6ib., and aftenvards increased as further quantities arrivedto B1b. for the cavalry and 101b. for the artillery, the latter being the full ration as fixed by the board of which Lord Lucan was president; and it so continued up to the time of the storm. Far the chargers of infantry officers the ration was continued at 61b.; but the Coimmissariat officers were ordered by me to offer to the infantry officers the option of a full ration of chopped straw or this diminished ration of Pressed hay, and they always chose the latter. Lord Lucan here stated that at this period his baggage animals had no rations at all ; but his lordship is again under a misapprehension on this point. I now hold in my hand his return, signed by an officer of his staff, which shows that up to the 28th of October both chargers and baggag,e animals lad fall rations of corn. Of hay up to that time the cavalry foraged for themselves, and took pretty much what they pleased. The Commissariat officers not having paid for the hay, it is not included in the return receipts. These returns also show that from the 28th of October up to the period of the storm both chargers and baggage animals had full rations of corn, and (as authorized by Lord Raglan) diminished rations of hay. The baggage animals of the army were at that time doing nothing; they did not then carry up their own forage or any fuel; and Lord Raglan having ordered that the Cosmmissariat transport uanmals which were in dep6t, and not working, should have reduced rations, I considered the order equally applicable to other baggage animals not working. Wen at a later period Lord Raglan ordered full rations to be issued for baggage animals, they were carrying up their oawn rations and fuel besides. On the occurrence of that storm, by whlich we lost 20 days' supply of hay for cavalry, artillery, and chargers-nearly all we possessedGeneral Canrobert maade an offer to Lord Raglan of a large quantity of hay (but not to the extent of 30 days' supply, as stated by Lord Lucan), upon condition that I should replace it within a certain period. I could not. Nevertheless, I rode over immediately to the Intendant-General at the French head-quarters, when I learned froni hini that it was not hay but chopped straw that he could lend me, and I ascepted it imme dately to the extent of three cargoes. I left the vessels, however, at Kaameisch until the straw should be wanted, in order not to furtlher crowd the already overcrowded harbour of Balaklava; and eventually when I did claim the forage the Prench could not u-ithout inconvenience to themselves spare me more than one cargoc, which was repaid to them within a short time. For a period of about 10 days after the hurricane-that is, from about the 20th to the 30th of November-there was a serious deficiency of forage; but, although I had represented in writing to Lord Raglass that, in consequence of the losses sustained on that occasion, the anny was placed in a critical position, particularly with respect to its supplies of forage, f nevertheless received complaints of deficiencies as though no such calamity had occurred. Notwithstanding this deficiency, we never vere without a supply of chopped strav, but it was quite inpossible to land and to issue suflicent quantities of that description of forage for the consumption of a large army. I will here read a report froni the depot Comlmissariat officer to show wbat our difficulties were in this respect. 'Up to this time we had only about 2.5 yards of quay and vwharfage accommnodation for Landing the supplies of the whole of the army-I mean, wharfage which boats could apProach to be zinladens; and this consisted of three or four small jetties which had been hastily and imperfectly constructed by the Commissariat :-r W"'While I greatly regret that the valuable time of the Field-Marshl comsmandin- should be occupied by a recurrence of such complaints, ? beg respectfuly to state that I made every possible endeavour to prevent them, and that no exertion is wanting on my part, not only barely to perform my duty, but to afford every possible accommodation and assistance to every rank in Her Majesty's service; but I would also request to he pennitted to submit to his lordship's consideration, the want of magazine accommodation the great confusionl which prevails frosmi the number of persons sent for the supplies necessary to maintain this large army, being, crowvded into the inconveniently limited su^ace of a veiry small potoiftevlag fglkaa zen the whole of its area would only suffice for our proper accommodation; whvlile we also experience great delay and diffculty from the very crowded state of the harbour, the frequent impossibility of approaching the vessels laden wNith our supphes, and the further delay of getting boats ashore fron the numerous warps and cables obstructig their passage, aid of getting them discharged from the very limited wfharves. I may aiso add that, for some weeks past, all these difficulties have been matarially increased by the arrival and landing of very large cargoes of clothing, hlts, and timber, which in many caseshave monopolized the large boats and much narrowed our wharves and roads. W. IL Dr-tsz, Deputy Commissary-General. " Commissariat, Crimea, January 28, 1855." From this state of things it was inevitable that there sh1ould be delay in the issues, and both horses and men must have suffered from waiting in the wet and the mud till the deliveries could be completed. There was, no doubt, a deficiency of forage throughout the winter ; but, if Lord Lucan should lay before the Board the correspo.ndence ead papers relating to the subject, as I hayv suggested, it wi hbe seen that the deficiencies in the issues of forage' to the cavalry divisioi vwere not so geat as might be inferrd from hlis lordship's statement. The deficiency was expelmened fir a greater degree by the infantry divisions in front. L,crd Lucan, in reply, remarked that, sq far from having said aisything to the disadvantage of the Commissariat -with regard i o the foraging of the troops in the neighbourhood of Varna, he had ahleaay stated that Lord Cardigan, the best judge of the facts, had expressed his approbation. When, however, Mr. Filder inferred that the Ioht Cavalry horses came up in perfectly good condition because they were in the same conditio.i as the horses of the H3eavy Cavalry, he isxXhed to soy that ri9 happened to see Lord Raglan on the ver7 day th1at lie (Lord %ucau) expected the Light Cavalry, and he said, in reply to a ,restion from his lordsNhip, thathEe considezefl Uio Ithe , t ot- Light CQYW horses tnuch About equal to that of the }eavy Brigade, but that iie was not sattisfied -with the oondition of either of them. He had never intended to attach blame to the Commissariat in consequence of the deficiency of forage on board the transports. As to the forage returns handed in to the Court, he was surprised that Mr. Bilder should allow himself to produce what Le (Lord Lucan) believed to be about thernest wvorthless documents hich officers of the army werecalled upon to sign. Every member of the Board knew that a moat extraord;nary system prevailed vwith regard to these forage returns, which were generally filled up bfore you got the forage; and ox this point he should like to refer to a memorandum by Colonel Gordon, in which he entirel'y concurred:- " The present system relative tothe issue of rations to the troops, and the receipts given for the rations issued, aypears to he very defective, and to invite irregularity, not E fraud; because the receipt for the articles issued is given on I the same paper and at the same time as the 'demand' for therm. This wvould not much signify if the rations were always forthcoming, but it frequently happens otherwise, especially with forage; and when this is the case the receipts are of course incorrect. But as they are the vouchers for the correctness of the Commissary's monthly abstract of issues, I expect it will 13e foundthat in many instances they are inserted in the abstract as they are signed for, and not according to the actual issues." He was ready to affirm in the most positive manner that that was the fact, and that these forage returns were not correct returns of the forage received while the army was in Bulgaria. Colonel Gordon continued:- "In out quarters, where forage is often scarce, and purchased in the neighbourhood by the Divisional Commissarythe amount for which the receipt is given is generaUy very much in excess of that actualy delivered, the horses being frequently sent to graze. In such cases what security has the public that the amount charged for is the amoumt purchased and issued? for the Commissariat officer has in his possession receipts in ful for the whole quantity demanded, which are also the vouchers for the correctness of his ab. stract; and I presume his abstract is intended to account for, or have some reference to, the stores placed under his charge, including forage and provisions purchased in the neighbourhood of his camp." He did not wish to say more on this subject, except that, if necessary, he would prove by evidence that every one of these forage returns was incorrect, and would give a very false impression as to the forage issued. &r. F ilder bad stated that there could be no great cause of complaint during the time the army was in Bulgaria, but a reference to his divisional orders wvould shov that there was not that regularity and sufficiency of forage which Mir. Filder -would lead the Board to suppose. It appeared now that the reduced allowance to which reference ad been made did receive the sanction of Lord Raglan. All he (Lord Lucan) could say upon the subject was that Lord Raglan had stated to him personally that the amount of the ration had been reduced by Mr. Filder without his sanction or knowledge. In aletter addressed by him (Lord Lucan) to the Quarterniaster-General, dated December 13, he called the attention of the Field-Mlarshal to the fact that the allowance of 81b. of hay, much more one of 61b., wvas totally insufficient, and that the French allowed 101b. to their smallest amimals. In consequence of this an order came out directing that full rations should be issued, but Mr. Filder waited upon Lord Raglan and obtained a memorandum for the continuance of the reduced allowance, it being ordered that the deficiency should be made up with chopped straw. The offer of General Canrobert, which had been alluded to, had originated from an application made by him (Lord Lucan), that the French shou[ldet them have 30 days' supply. He admitted the difficulties -which had been experienced with regard to the lauding of the forage. Mr. Filder said, that Colonel Gordon's memorandum, read by Lord Lucan, related to a very different state of things from that which existed in Bulgaria. In the present case the deficiencies in the issues were shown upon the vouchers, which would be impossible under the system described by Lord Lucan as prevailing. Mfr. Crookshank, Deputy-Assistant Commissary-General, was called and examiined by Mr. Filder, to show what the practice wa-s with respect to fillmig up the ration returns, and charging the issues in the Commissariat accounts. He stated that if there was a deficiency it was noted, and only the quantity actually issued was charged in the accounts. Lord Lucan.-Is it not true that you were unable to furnish the Commissioners of Inquiry with the amount of deficiencies in the forage for the cavalry during a period endinig with the beginning of January.?-Yes, and the reason was that at the period I was examined I no longer had possession of the accounts which would have enabled me to supply that information. Lord Lucan.-In their report the commnissioners say:- " During the great scarcity of hay and straw, between the 14th of qfoveamber and the 1st of January, the Coiimsissariat appear to have been in nearly the same difficulty as the quartermasters in regard to furnishing any accurate statements of their issues." In reply to questions from the CoURT, Mr. Filder said the rule was not to issue back rations, however full the magazines might be. This was a regulation made by the Treasury, not by the Comi,rissariat. Lord Lucaa asked whether the Board would allow him to address them after Colonel TuUoch had replied ? Colonel Tulloch said, Lord Lucan had taken objection to a great number of his figures and calculations, withlout, however, showing how they were inaccurate. No doubt all this would be brought out in his lordship's reply, and he (Colonel Tulloch) should, therefore, like to have an opportunity of ma;ing a counter statement. The Boardretired to deliberate as to the course they would adopt. After an absence of about 20 minutes the Commissioners returned, and The JUDGE-AnDVOCATE, addressing Lord Lucan, said, the Board had decided to pursue the course they had originally stated as the mode of conducting the proceedings. The Court had heard him (Lord Lucan) upon his complaint respecting the commissioners' report, and had also allowed Colonel TuUoch, upon his own application, to give evidence and to exanue witnesses. Upon the last application of Lord Lucan the Court had decided upon adhering as closely as possible to analogous proceedings in other courts of law. Colonel Tulloch would be allowed to mak-e any observations he pleased upon the evidence adduced by Lord Lucan, and the latter having opened the complaint would be permitted to reply upon the whole case. Lord Lucan then requested to be allowed to examine Colonel Tulloch. In reply to questions from the noble Earl, Colonel Tulloch stated, that the first day of examining witnesses in the Crimea was the 16th of March, and the Last day was the 30th of May. Nlo witnesses were examined at Constantinople whose evidence appeared in the report; but one or two were examined at Scutari, whose evidence it was afterwards thought unnecessary to quote. Sir J. M'BTeiU made many inquiries at Constantinople as to Comcnissariat matters. The commissioners quitted the Crimea on account of ill health. One reason for their not returning to the Crimea was, tha' Sir J. M'Neill was not sufficiently recovered, and, moreover, the comnissioners were of opinion that they had acquire I all the information in the Crimea which could be obtained the only evidence then wanting being the replies of Genera! Airey to questions wich had been sent to him from Con stantinople. Sir J. M'NeiU intimated to Lord Panmur; that he should not remain beyond the middle of Juno, conceiving that their inquiry was completed, and he shoul I then join his family at Trieste. uThe commissioners left Constantinople about the 14th of June, and he (Colone' Tulloch) arrived in England in about three weeks, Sir J. M'Neill not arriving until about a month later. In answer to the BOA\RD, Lord Lucan said he intended ta connect these questions witlh the report of which he complained. Colonel Tuloch's examination continued.-I saw the Mlinister of War within a week after my airival. I think the telegraphic instructions to General Airey to reply t the uuestsons of the commissioners were sent by the Minisierof lVar inimediatelyupon the arrival of Sir J. M'NeillinEngland. Aftermy arrival inEngland, and before the presentation of our second report in January, I believe, we did not communicate officially with any officer belonging to the army in the East, but privately, it is possible, I may have done so. I had many comminications with Colonel Gordon after my return. He called frequenitly at my office and revised his own evidence, and those communications led to our examining him again to explain the evidence which had already been given by him. Sir J. M'Neili and myself were sent to the Crimea to inquire into circumnstances which had happened there, and we did not consider we had power to open an inquiry in this country; but we thought it ought to give ,Colonel Gordon an opportunity of replying to counter statements which had been made here, and to ex-plain some ambiguity in his formier evidence. Was your inquiry closed wlhenyouleft the Crimea, seeing that you examined Colonel Gordon and General Airey in this country ?-The inquiry was certainly closed, and wVe had doubt about the propriety of re-exaamining Colonel Gordon in this country, but we thought it the fairest course to pursue, and I presunic, if the Government had considered we had done wrong in that matter, it would have excluded that evidence from the report, as other matters were omitted. I had no power to examine other witnesses in this country. If the Government had thought it necessary, no doubt they would have instructed us to do so. The queries addressed to Colonel Gordon wil show that such heavy charges -were conveyed in regard to the Quartermaster. General's stores, that it was only just to allow hiui the fullest opportunity oE replying to them. We examined Colenel Hodge, then acting as Brigadier of Cavalry. an verygen rwl oicrwose nameapperee iu the list fur nished to us by order of Lord Raglan. The other general officers of cavalry were absent, and we did not consider it necessary to send written queries to them, as we exauiined every officer on the spot, and wve could not follow every one who went away. I know of no particular informationr which we could ave derived from examining your lordship, as we were directed to examine certain officers in the Crimea, and we did not go beyond that, except in the case of General Airey. WVe did not send quenes to any officer not in the Crimea at the time. I was guided much in the choice of persons to be examined bymy colleague, Sir J. M'Neill, and we confined our inquiries strictly to what took place in the Crimea, having omitted much of the evidence wvhich related to what occurred at Varna, believing that to-be beyond the scope of our duty. Upon our arrival in the Crimea we sent a copy of our instructions to Lord Raglan, who directed every divisional comrnander to give IIs all the information we might require. We did not tell him that we intended to inquire into the conduct of any officer. I would observe, that as the Government has expressedits satis- faction at our performance of our duties, I imagine that it is not now a subject for discussion whether we exceedel our duties. The approbation of the report consists in its presentation to Parlanient. It was read over by the Secretary for War, and alterations made in it, and the presentatioit of such portions as were left implies the approbation of that repoit as laid before Parliament. I could produce letters to shiow that if our report is impugned the Government ig xeady to support it. General PEEL.-Can youi read those letters? Colonel Tulloch.-r can produce a letter to that effecf, but I must havv6the authority of the writer before doing se. I may mention that Lord Palme rston stated in the hou e that the Goverm-nut approved the report. He expressed himself satisfied witL' it, ars4 did so when we returned. I haye received the %vri,*.l ippF9b1Aion of the niqyepment andE to has Sir J. M'Teir In still stronger terms. I have here one letter to myself which I may read. Colonel Tulloch then read a letter from Colonel Mundy, the private secretary to Lord Panmure, dated April 7, l 1S5G, in which, after replying to an application for papers1 and documents, the-writer went on to say, I bave to add, that although the Government wish to leave the conduct gf the inquiry to the Board, they are prepared in all respects to support the commissioners, should their renort be imupugned." 1erhaps, said Colonel Tulloch, it will be unne. cescary after that to preduce any private letters to prove the agprobation of the Jovernment of our proceedings. CDolonel Tuloch's examination was then resumed.-I deny1 having animadverted upon Lord Lucan except pernaps ini the paragraph relating to Colonel Greffiths's evidence. l Irrespective of any animadversion upon me, would it not have been only fair to have examined me, as the officer com-i manding the cavalry, before commenting upon the excessive Ioss of horses ?-We had not the power. An inquiry may hereafter take place into this very subject. The Government may want to know who are the oficers who have been ; uilty of want of promptitude and ingenuity; but Lord j lucan cannot expect me to open a new inquiry upon a subject into which I have no power to enter. We had only to report upon evidence which we collected in the Criniea Did you or Sir J. M'Neill draught the first report ?-I do not think that is quite a fair question. The BOARD decsded that the witness need not answer the question unless he chose. Colonel Tulloch.-I may say voluntarilv that occasionzaly we both of us draughted portions of the zeport in order to compare our opunons on various pointse Our reort was susbmitted to the Minister of War in, I believe, two portions, during the time he was confined to his house, and had an opportunity of fully considering it. Sir J. Y'Neill, I believe, took bath trtions of the report to Lord Panmure. The inister for war has omitted from the reportsubmitted to Parliament some portions of the report we made to him. One.subject was the high rate of mortality in the regiments. We called for returns from the medical officers, but, as that subject formed no portion of our instructions, the Minister for War omitted it from the report which was laid before parliament. The JuDnc-ADjvOcATE, on.behalf of the Board, inquired of Colonel Tulloch whether he had any other document to show that the Government had ever approved or would ap. prove the commissioners' report'.l-Colonel Tulloch replied. that he had, but would wish topostpone givinga specific answer to that question until he had had en opportumty of lookring over his letters and papers. The Beard then, at .3 o'clock, adjourned until to-morrow (this) mornng. ___
I NA YXAL AND MILITARY lZTEBLLIGENc-g. The foliowing letter, d Me alta, April 12, is from our own correspondent:- "The English steamitug General Pelissier arrived from Shields, Gibraltar, and Algiers on the 9th, bound to Con stantinople. " The schooner Black-eyed Susan, with Government stores from London, arrived on the 11th. "The City of London steam transport left for Genoa on the 9th, to bring over another cargo of oxen for the British Commissanat, whose stocks, as well as that of the contractors, continue very low from the prevailing snurrain. " The Imperial stoam transport left on the 10th for Constantinople. "Rer Majesty's steam frigate Miranda left for Gibraltar on the afternoon of the 9th, to takeup that station untilthe return of the steamer now at that port, about to leave for England for the trial of one of her officers by Court-martial. Rear-Admiral Sir Montagu Stopford, who has been for nearly three months past ailing from fever, took passage in the Miranda for change of air. During his absence RearAdmiral Sir Houston Stewart will take charge. At about 2 p.m. the wind suddenly shifted from ES.E. to N.W., blowing forabout half an ho. r a tremendous hurricane. No damages were sustained by the shipping in port, but several Lave since arrived with cargoes shifted and leaky, from having been cast on their beam-ends. The Miranda was caught by the hurricane just after clearing the harbour's mouth, unable to regain which easily, she ran before it, and got into Marsa, Sirocco Bay, on the south-east coast of the island, where she remained until the 11th, when the weather moderated.

The Commander-in-Cihef of the fleet at Portsrmouth and Rear-Admiral Sir M. F. Berkeley held a levee yesterday at the Admiralty-house, which was attended by all the captains of the fleet, with the object of finally arranging the movements to be executed at the review by the Queen. The fleet was joined yesterday by the Amphion, 34, Captain Henry Chads; the Pylades, 21, Captain D'Eyncourt; and the Harier, 17, Commander Derriman, froi the Baltic; and the Archer, 14, Captain Heatheote, from Portsmouth harbour.

The weather yesterday was exceedingly fine, and the fleet looked grand in the extreme. All who desire to view its unbroken and deeply-strildng proportions should see it as it now is, and steam through it. The General Screw Company's steam transport Calcutta sailed for the Crimea yesterday morning with the Government passengers previously enumerated in Tke Times. The Golden Fleece and the J ason will sail this morning for the same destination. These three vessels will be employed in the conveyance of horses and troops from the Black Sea to England. The preparations for the grand naval review at Spithead on the 23d inst. are causing considerable activity at Southanipton. Nearly the whole of the accommodation at the principal hotels is disposed of, and the difficulty to procure sleeping apartments is already apparent. The Peninsular and Oriental Company are preparing the whole of their available ships for the purpose of conveying the directors and shareholders and their friends to lwitness the dis. play. These vessels will include the screw steamers Alma, Sultan, Afanilla, and Alhambra, and the paddlewheel ships Euxine and Ripon. The Pasha of Egypt's small steamyacht Mustapha Bey, now lying at Southampton, will also leave for Spithead. The Royal Mail Company are getting ready the Atrato and Tay to convey their directors and shareholders, and Her Majesty's screw steamtransport Himalaya is, under the superintendence of Captain Engledue, Superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, being provided w-ith sleeping accommodation for 600 persons. This fine vessel wvill also be present during the review. Berths are also made up on board many of the ships in the docks for the use of the members of the mail companies. Several announcements of the departure forSpithead of chartered steamships, at one guiinea per head, are posted throughout the town. It is expected that between 20 and 30 steamers will leave Southampton on the day of the grand spectacle, carrying an immense number of spectators. The directors of the Southbanpton Dock Company have agreed that on this occasion no tonnage dues or other charges shall be made on steaniers coming in to embark or to land passengers. The passengers also will be (mbarked and landed free of charge. The company, however, require notice from all steamships not belonging to lhe port, in order that proper berths mnay be assigned to tlhem. The Imperatriz steam transport, Captain Cox, arrived at Portsmouth yesterday from the eastward, with Russian (late) prisoners, as specified in The Times of yesterday. She has embarked others at Portsmouth, and will take in more from Lewes and convey them to a port in the Baltic. The Lancashire Witch clipper, 1,390 tons, Captain A. S. Molison, belonging to Messrs. Dunbar and Co., sailed from Portsmouth yesterday for Hobart Town and Wellington, New Zealand, with the following officers and men for the above posts :-Major Blosse, 11th Regiment, in military commani d; Dr. Birkett, of the 74th, in mnedical charge; 3 fficers, 74 non-commissioned officers andprivates, 2 women, 5 children, and 6 buglers and drummers of the 11th Regiment; 1 officer, 85 non-cozmmissioned officers and men, 2 women, and 5 children of the 12th Regiment; and 1 officer, 251 men, 30 women, and 29 children of the 65th Beghnent. The gunboats Spey and Tilbury, 'which sailedfrom WooL -wich on Wednesday evening for Portsmouth, put in from stress of weather, and anchoied during the night at Green,bithe, but left again yesterday. TP9 mortar-fIoats, I9s.l k2 and 113, were yesterday received at Woolwich from Messrs. Scott Russell's. They are to go into basin to be rigged and fitted out. A new screw steam gunboat, the Peacock, 2, with engines of 69-horse power, has been launched at Messrs. Pitcher's, of Northfieet, and forwarded to Wool-! wich, where she is to be docLed and fitted for service. A telegraphic raessage was yesterday morning forwarded to Deptford and Woolwich dockyards from the Lords of the Admiralty, giving instructions for the immeediate suspension of any further despatch of gunboats and vessels thence to| Portsmouth, the number intended for the naval reviewbein.I complete. Orders have been received at Woolwich arsenal to prepare ammunition for the use of seven regiments of the line about to proceed to Canada. These regiments, it is said, are to be transported from the East to Canada, in the Dnke of Wellington and other large vessels of war, immediately after the termination of the great naval review at Portsmouth. The order for continuing the large establishment employed at Woolwich arsenal has been countermanded, and fresh instructions have been delivered by the war authorities, by which it is decided that a reduction in the number of Labourers woriDng in the various departments must be attempted. On or about the 1st of May aext 53 collarmakers are to be discharged from the storekeeper's department; 200 of different trades are to be pensioned and dismissed from the carriage factory; and 200 men and boys are to be discharged from the laboratory. A circular has been forwairded from the Horse Guards to the officers comimanding depOts at Chatham garrison, direct. ing that the settlement of accounts of bread, meat, and forage for the army be transferred from the Commissariat to the War Department, and, ordering that in future the forms directed tobe kept are to be sent tothe examiner at the WarD)epartment, and the duplicates to the office of the Accountant-General.
CIV1 RECBPTION OF THE EBW AIERICA.7 MIF7ISTER Iast night the Right lHon. the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress entertained his Excellency Mr. Dallas, the newv American Minister, at dinner at the MIansion-house, in honour of his arrival in this county as the accredited representative of the great Transatlantic Republic. A numerous and ditinguished company were invited on the occasion, aimoudi n aiong many others, Mrs. and Miss Dallas, Mlr. P. lRallwt, Mliss Nicklin, Lord Stanley, MP., Mr. Walpole, M.P., Mtr. 3Miner Gibson, MA., Mr. Cardwell, MYP., Captain Scobell, MYP., the Hon. J. Byng, M1r. W. Milesj x.p, Mr. Roebuck-, M.F., Mr. Mlasterman, MLP., lMr. Stafford, M.P., Mr. Cowan, M.P., Mr. Heywood, MY., and Mrs. Heywood, Mr. Mowatt, M.P., BIr. Bowyer, bLP., MIr. Cheethamn, M.P., Mr. Hadfield, Mf.D., Ilr. Horsfall, M.D., MIr. MEaims, 3LD., Mir. J,C. Ewart, MY., Mrf. Adam Blac'k, M.D., Sir Charles and LadyEastlake, the LordProvostof Edinburgh, Mr. W. C. WVentworth, Sir James Duke, Bart., 1.D., and MrTs. Hil1, and Alderman Cubitt, Mff.D. On the removal of the cloth the usual loyal and constitutional toasts were drunk- and responded to, that of " The Army and Navy " by Mr. MalEs, MLP., and Captain ScoIma, M.P., respectively. The LORD MAYOR then said he rose to propose the health of one of his honoured guests that evening, his Excellency the representative of the United States. (Cheers.) Mr. Dallas had kindly honoured him with his company, and he rejoiced to see him at his table, because he was the representative of thatgreat kindred nation on the other side of the Atlantic. (Cheers.) Ever since he (the Lord Mayor) had the honour of being connected withthe corporation of London he had always found the American Minister one of the most honoured guests at the banquets at theMansion-house. He remembered how often he had had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Abbott Lawrence, a former American Minister on such occasions. There the American Minister, w%hoever he might he, was always welcomed, and it had invariably afforded the greatest pleasure to the citizens of London who were invited to meet him there, inasmuch as it afforded them an opportunity of reciprocating those kindly feelngs which it was the interest as well as the duty of Englishmen to cultivate towards their fellow citizens and national kinsmen on the opposite side of the Atlantic. (Cheers.) There wasno reason whatever why they should be jealous of the Americans; but, on the contrary, there was every reason why they should he proud of them. He w,as sure he rightly interpreted the feelings of the people of this country when he said that all they desired with respect to the Amuerican people was that the most intimate social aelations should ever exyist betsen the two countries. (Cheers.) They spoke the same language, and possessed a common literature, and he could hardly understand how any qUestiOn could arise the settlement of which could render it necessary to have recourse to the dreadful alternative of war. (Hear, hear.) He presided there on behalf of his fellow-citizens, who entertained no other feelings than those of the most cordial friendship towards the American people, which feelings they desired to perpetuate; and had invited Mr. Dallas to partake of his hospitality because his Excellency was the representative of a kindred nation, to whom the people of Great Britain were united yconsiderations of a common origin and a common language. He begged to propose " The Health of Mr. Dallas, and Prosperity to the great Republic to which he had the honourto belong." (Cheers.) The toast was drunk- with enthusiasm, the band playing "Hail Columbia" and "Yankee Doodle." Mr. DaLnAs, on rising to respond to the compliment, was greeted with enthusiastic cheers. He said,-ly Lord Mayor, ladies, and gentlemen, the very mind and complimentary language with which your Lordship has prefaced the last toast and the cordial manner in which it has been received by this distinguished assembly are entitled, and I hope will receive, my return of gratitude. In truth, I am almost bankrunt in the language of thanks; for ever since I landed in the dominions of your illustrious Queen, as the representative of the American Government and people, I have met with nothing but a series of the most flattering demonstrations of welcome and hospitahty. (Cheers.) I perfectly well know that these manifestations are not addressed to an individual so utterly unworthy as myself, and that they are the profuse and generous tribute to a nation whose messenger I am. But on its behalf, with a sensibility that I know it would unanimously feel, I beg this distinguished company to accept the assurance of my profound acknowledgments. There are some subjects on which it -would be ill-timed, and more enterprising than wise, for me to touch on this occasion and in this presence. Indeed, my arrival is so recent that I scarcely can pretend to know the subjects Which -would be most acceptable to you. I dare say, however, I shall incur but little hazard if I venture, according to a provmciahsm natural to a western tongue, to "g guess" that the spirit and purpose of anew comer may have excited at least some little curiosity. (A laugh.) Well, my Lord, let me say that I am not authorized to feel, and do not feel, any desire other than that of giving my exertions and energies unreservedly to the restoration of the most harmonious sentiments and friendly relations. (Cheers.) Animated by this spirit, and aiming at such a purpose, if I fail-and I may fail-it will be because of some inexorable, over-uling State policy, or some foregone conclusion not to be undone by uniform, steady, persevering, frank, and honourable conciliation. (Renewed cheers.) My Lord, permit me, in conclusion-for any object is to be exceedmngly brief-to tender to your Lordship and the guests assembled here my congratulations on the great event consummated since my arrival among you-the restoration of peace to Europe. (Cheers.) War, although undoubtedly accompanied by its moral benefits or alleviations, is at best an evil; and the vast powers of. this empire, although for.a time, and however gallantly, enlisted and ably directed, will find more genial and more fruitful employment in those chaunels, agriculture, commercial, and manufacturing, and those pursuits which have hitherto so signally illustrated the exertions of her people. (Loud cheers.) My Lord. I again thank you. The lORnD A-O then gave "'The House of Lords," associating w ith it the name of Lord Stanley. Lord SnxsavSE, M.D., briefly acknowvledged the compliment. It was a bold thing, he said, to undertake in any companay, still niore in their presence, to be the spokesmnan of Parlimnent. But there w as one idea whlich predominated in all their minds, and on that subject he thought he might venture without presumption to say that he could express the unanimous feeling not only of the Legislature, butwhat was quite as i;uprtant-of those for w hom the laws were made. (Hear.) le thanked the Lord Mayor for having given him that opportunlity-an opportunity of which others had availed themselves-of expressing aloud that which was in the thoughts of all-namely, their deep, earnest, and almost passionate desire that, be the chances and changes of political events what they might, Enuglaudmight retain inviolate that~ national alliance of which they had among them at that moment the living representative-an alliance, which had its root in no consideration of temporary or political ex-pediency, but which rested on the surer basis of the common origin, the coinmon language, the conmnon laws, the COmmlOn energies, and the common aspirations of two mighty empires, and ev-en in that which they must all acknowledge-a common family likeness in common faults and failings. (Cheers, and a lau,gh.) UpIon the union of these two natio'ns depended the hopes of mankind and the peace of the world; and if they went on as they had done for a long time past, wiathin a century from the present time the earth would be inhabited by 300,000,000 of the Anglo-Saxon raCe-the most energetic, industrious, and enterprising people that ever tilled its soil. It w as upon the cordial union of that vast mnultitude of men, our descendants, that the future hove of mankind rested-a future of rational progress and well-ordered freedom, in which the knowledge of man should he extended, his power over nature increased, and his command of the appliances of civilization multiplied; and it rested with England and the UJnited States to act on that principle. (Cheers.) Mr. CmnD5Vnu., M.D., in acknowledging the toast of "The House of Commons," proposed by the Lord MIayor, said he was sure the Commons of EKngland would not fail to reciprocate those fraternal feelings which had been expressed by the AKmerican Minister on behalf of a people who with ourselves spoke a common languarre and enjoyed the blessings of a common Christianity. li[e could nut forget that free institutions, whether hero or there, rested on that firm basis of common law which we andthey alike inherited fromu our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, and that they nowv had the privilege to be entertained by the first of those municipalities which constituted an integ,ral and important p art in the great hierarchy of free institutions. (Hear, hear4l The lion, member concluded by proposing. " The Health of the Lord .Mayor." The LOan biaOR briefly acknowvledged the complimnctt. Mrr. Dainxs then, in graceful terms, gave " The HIealth of the lady Mayoress," which was drunk with acclamation. The LOBn MAYOR, in responding to the toast, told Mir Dalas that if his diplomacy was equal to his gallantry ha should have no fear of the success of his misrsion. (A Several other appropriate toasts were dTnnk in the course of the evening, and the company separated about 11 o'lIoak. plt, evntser whficiated as ohastnastgr.
GROss SrERs-MTXo_.-Afew days since a gentleman, while walking through the village of Farley, WVilts (near Bath), was surprised at the lord beating of a drans near the brook. On aesing a rustic the reason for sucha a proceeding he was informed that a farmer's carter had recently been drowned in the brook, and that, not finding the body by drag , g, they were now beating a drum, expecting to seethe body rise when the drmn camie to the spot where the deceased lay. The gentleman eexpressed his surprise at this superstition, on w,hich the villager assumred him that the body would certainly mnake its ap. pearance. On returning that wvay in the afternoon t.he gentleman w as anxious to learn the result of the experiment, and was informned that the body had not risen as wasexpected. The people, however, told him that they had another plan, wbich could not fail, and which they were about to put in practice as follow s:-A half-quarteril loaf was to be put into the brook at the place where the deceased fell in, to be floated down the stream, and on reaching the spot where the body was the loaf was expected! to turn round three times and then go down.
