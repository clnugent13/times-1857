| SOLDIERS ASHARVSTLABOABRE.& : -(From the Manchater Â¢usrdien.) If, in the words of the popuar saying, "Turn and tuin about is fair play," -we mayrefer, without either exltation oa the one hand, or regret on the other, -to the pesent sin.; gular chaue in the market for agriutura labour. 'Tho other day'Â§ir Morton Peto wroteto ta-he 2Tmcs, that "the price of harvest labour has risen until the farmers outbid railway contractors, and w find ourselves compelled to suspend, for the present, the execution of all but very pressng publiec works. ' Navvies,' who. were earning from 4s. 3d. to 4s. 6d. a-day, -have -left us because they can earn moro at harvesting." Some two or three yeaZs sgo it was the other way.; the railway contractors then, by higher .wages, drew away from the farmers' service their best paid -and ablest labourers.. So thebt here, at all- 6v6nts, is a singular changeof position, between two classes of-earth labour. But a still more striking turi of the labour wheel is exlhibited, if we look bacs to 18345 - when the great depression of agricultural wages and the -superabund, arco of labour in' the large farming districts of England were ocnl relieved by a considerable nigration from the south to the north; agricultural labourers from Back-~ inghamshire, &c., becoming workers in Lancashire cotton mills, obtaining constant employment, and earning (as families) thrice the amount'of wsges paid for agricuhural labour in the districts they had quitted. This measure was found so beneficial that in the parish where the experiment was first tried the rates were reduced one half, mainly in consequence of the migration.' But the consequence was, that at lenath the landowners sent northward a number of agicultural labourers, -with their wives and ehildren, for wnose coming iio preparation had been made; and it became necessary to stop the indiscriminate pouring of agi. cultural labourers into the manufacturing disticts, and to substitute a gradual absorption of them, family by family, for this migration en nzasse. Since that period the balance of labour has been better preserved in this' country. In the sister kinedom, how.- ever, there was for a long time a vast superabundance of labour, and no adequate demand; nor was the scale turned, till famino, 'fever, and enmigratiou lowered the numbers of the population below even those of the preceding decennial census, and the alarm was raised that Ireland was becoming depopulated. Again, the d:scovery. of the goldfields of California and Australia has offered temptations to the labourers of England to emigrate to regions where, too often and too generally, theirhopes-alone have been' golden. The war, too, must have done its shar.e i taing ifrom the plough a number of the hardy sons of labour. But, notwithstandimg these draughts of our population, we see in the announcement of harvzest Labour be7ng scarc'e and dernothing to alarm us. True, we nolongermeet ever where the numerous bodies of Irish respers, who, in. years past7 landing inliverpool, Bristol, &c., spread over the country- their periodicd labours, and retrned home with their harvest savings, as the mainstay of themselves and their families 'through a hard and pinching winter. They are -now better employed, either nearer their old homes, or in' new ones across the Atlantic. There seems, as yet, no reason to believo that the scarcity of agricultural labour is permanent in this counry. If temporary, and merelv the reult of a sudden and . simultaneous ripening of the grain all over, the country, or at least over large tracts where in ordinary seasons it comes to maturity successively, then, surely,the provision to meet it needs only to be a temporary measure. Sir Morton Peto's " navviee,' when harvest work is over will doubtless be ready to return to their spade work in railway construction, and the curo wil arrive as suddenly as the evil. But Sir Xorton has somewhat hastily.and without consideration, as it seems to us, sug ested that Government should give instructions to the commanding offioersofregimentstoallowthe soldiers, not figuratively but m fact, to exchaugetheirswords for sickles-and reapinghooks, and to cut the oern wherever there is need of laborers to' get the -harvest. This suggestion, we trust, will f,nd no. favour with the: authorities; for it has' the double fault of being uinnecessary and: mischievous. There can be no question that there is.a large body' of unemployed labourers in almost all, our populous towns, who, by a little of such organization as the master manufacturers employed in 183,f5, could be got together and sent to the very places where they are most .needed, without loss of time, with little cost, vwith temporary relef to the local poor rates, and good woork and wages to the men themselves. On the other band, with no wish to write a single word in de.Dreciation of the many excellent qualities of the British soldier,' we cannot close our eves to the fact that, in the late Crimean campaign, an extra sispenice per dhem afforded a temptation to intemperance which many of the poor fellows were wholly unable to resist To send companies, peihaps regiments, of soldiers from bar. racks into free. country quarters, relieved from all military superintendence, all discipline cast aside, and -with 'money in their pockets and a beerhouse at every turn,-we can imagine few things more injurious,' individually, to the men themselves, moredemoralizing and ruinous to their collective character as soldiers. To what end have they profited by the severe discipline of war and inclement seasons, if they are to be, cast loose over their native land, to neglect for a time all the lessons of the past, and to revel in a short-lived liberty? To what purpose are our barracks extended and huge camps formed, but to con. centrate our soldiery together, and to diseipline them muore rigidLy to act consentaneouslyin larger masses than heretofore? Yet this proposal to turn them out, a few to engage with one fanner, a few* with another, for the short period required for the labours of the harvest, would be 'to segregate themn still more, to remove them from under that wholesome control which is; indispensable to military discipline, and to undo habits of obedience, punctuality, and 'rder, which it may tal1e a lon$time once more.to implant.' That the cern is generally ripe and the 'harvest' plenteous, we are glad to learn; that any considerable portion of it vill perish for lack of labour to get it in, wo fcannot bring ourselves to believe. A vigorous effort, 'and a little sensible combination and organization of the.farmers and their landlords to pro. cure labour, -would soon dissipate all fear of the' harvest being lost from' the fewness of the labourers. - But the Government, wve trust, will, at all events, sanction 'no such dangerous inteiference wiith the labour-markec as to thro.w the military force of: the o intoa rude and artificial competition with' those wiho have no' other ans of- livelihood. This would, indeed, be a retrograde movement in the great march of 'economic and social progress.

As regrds foreign prodiots, i some arrive in this country in an adulterated condition, while others are adulterated by the English dealer. Other commodities, agau, the produce of this country, are shown to be in an aduterated state v when. passing. into thie bands of the dealers, while others undergo adulteration by the dealers themselves. -- d a by the - -"Not cnly is the pubolic -heath thius exposed to' daneer, and pecuniary fraud cornmitted on the whole conmmunity; but the public morality is tainted, and the high commercial character of this country sericusly lowerea, both at home and in the eye= of foreign countries. - Though, hapily, very many refuse, under every torpttion, to fa,sifj.:the quality of their waresj there are, unortuntely, large numbers who, thouga reluctantly practising deception, Yield to, the pernicious contagion of example, or to the hard pressure of competition forceda upon them by their less scrupulous neighbuoursi taken, your committeo Would enumerate the leading articles which have been proved to-be more or less commonly adulterated. These are, arroWroot, adulteratedwinth potato and other starches; bread, withpotatoes, plaster of Pazis, alum, and sulphate of copper; bottled fruits and vegetables with cgrtiin salts of copper ;eoffee.with chicory, roasted wheat, beans, and mzngo rdwurel ;chiory with roasted wheat, carrots,sawdust, and Venetan-si red; cocoa with arrowroot, potato;flour, sugar, chicory, and some ferrugincus red earths; cayenne 'with . ground ncIe,nm ilrd husk, &c., coloured sawi.red lead, Venetiln red, and turmeric; gin, with grainsLof Paradse, sulphuric'acid, and cayeime; lard with potato-flour, mutton suet; ilum, carbonate of soda, and caustic liine; mnstard aith-wheatfIour and turmeric; marnalade with apples or turnips;- porter and stout (though sent out in a puie state from the brewers) with water, sugar, treaclr salt, alum,- cocculus Indicus, grains of Paradise, nuxvomica, and sulphuric acid; pickles and preserves with salts ofeenp0 s miff with various chromates, red lead, lime, and powderedglass; tobacco -wit water, sugar, rhubarb, and treacle; viegar with -water, sugar, and sulphuric acid ;, jamap with powdered wood;opium with poppy capsules, wheat-flour, powrdered wood, and sand; scammony with wheat-flour, chalk, resin, and sand; confectionery with plster of, Pads and other similar ingredients, coloured with varous- pigments of a highly poisonous natue; and acid drops, purporting to be compounded of Jargonelle pear, Ribstone 'pppin, lemon, c., with essential oils coutamning prassi acid or other dangerous ingredients. * t d "The adulteration of drugs is extensively practised.; and when it is borne in mind that the correctness of a medical prescription rests on an issume&d standard of strength and purity in the drugs or compounds emplosed, and how frequently life itself depends upon the efficacy of the medicnes prescribed, it is difficult to exggerate the evils arising from this prevalent fraud. " The adulterat.on of drinLs deserves also special notice, because your committee cannot but conclude that the intoxication so deplorably prevalent is in many cases less due to the natural properties of the drinks themselves than to the admixture of narcotics or other noxious substances intended to supply the properties lost by dilution. " Though adulteraieons prevail more or lessin aU districts, it may be assumed, as a rule, that the poorer the distric' the greater is-the amount of adulteration. Nor have the poor the same power to protect themselves against such frauds as their richer neighbourg; they are necessarily limited to such means of purchase as are afforded by,the immediate locality in which they reside, and are, moreover, too often bound to one dealer by the facilities of- credit which he affords them. - " These adulterations may be classifiod iiuder2thrfe heads -those of which the objectis to lower theprice of theartiele adulterated, by the admixture of substances of a cheaperkind; those vwhich are intended to improve the isppoarance of the adulterated article, and thus in many casesto deceive the public as to its quality; and those which are practised for epurpose of simulaing some property injured or destroyed in thoprocess of aduteration. " IAdulterations in each of these classes are of two kinds, -those in which are employed substances of an innocuous character; and those in which the niixtures are more or less injurious to health, either directly by the noxious properties 1 of the ingredients, or indirectly by loweming the-nutritive qualities of the artiecle adulterated. " In dealing with these various adulterations, it is necissary to distinguish between the pecuniary fraud practised on the public, and the injury to public health. If, regards the adulteration of articles with substances of a cheaper and innocuous character, the public derive the full benefit of this cheapness in a lower price, it would be difficult, if not unwise, for the Legislature to interfere, unlessit coldd do so by requiring that every such article be sold as a mixture, as distinguished from the article in its puro state. This the law alreay requires as to the article of coffee, and also as to the article ofjbread, which, unless made of wheatflour alone, must be distinctly marked with the letter 'MX.' BuT, whenever an article' is so adulterated as to involve pecuniary fraud or injuryto helth, it appears to your comeitten to be the duty of the Legislature 'to provide somo efficient remedy. * "It has been objected that the best course will be to leave the buiyer.to tak-e care of himself. Butthere are many adulterations which it isimnpossible for the buyer to detect. Already the law takes notb of frauds in wreights and measures, of injuries likLely to result to the publio health- from the sale of unwholesome animal food, and indeed Of mauy adulterations, though in most cases onlyvwith a viewe to fiscal considerations, and not to those of a moral or sanitary character. is It is said, too, that there are many frauds which Lgislation cannot reach or punish. But, on the other hand, it wrould beiffrcult to tOil the numberless frauds which legis- lation may prevent. The great difficulty of legiilating on this snbject lies in puttrag an end to the liberty of fraud vwithout affecting the freedom of coramerce. "With iview to form an opinion as to the best remedyfor this growing evil, your committee have obtained evidence as to the law- on adulterations in other countries, and especially in France, Belgium, Germany, and the United States. In this object your comnmittee have baen materiaUy assisted by returns procured through the kindness of Lord Clarendon from some of our Ministers at foreign Courts. . " As to the present state of the law in this country, -our committee received much valuable information from Mr. S. R. Goodman, the legal adviser to the justices of the city of London. - "The followingis a brief statement of the laws of different eountries on the subject of adulterations:- - - "1 In France, a law, hearing date-the 27th of March, 18514 confirmed and extended the penal code to ail adulterations in I alimentary and medical substaces.' To this law was., added one of the 5th of May, 855. applicable to the adulteration of drinks. The law of Marc; 1851, was founded upon two reports of a commission of inqr' bearin date tho 24th of January and 26th of FebruaryssL. -helaw of gay,'1855, was preceded by a like report made the 29th of -March,I . 1855 " . The provisions of these laws apply-1. To those who shall adulterate any alimentary or medicimal substances intended for sale. 2. To those who sha sell or expose forsale suechsubstances, knowing them.tobe adulterat d "If theaticle adulterated containasnbstances iniurioas to: health, the line ranges from 50f, to- 50f.; with inprisenment from three months' to two years; these punishments. being applicable even- in cases where the adulteration is known to the buyer or consumer. "-A penaltv of 16f. to 2Sf., and imprisonment from sLx toten days, or one of those - modes 'of, punishment, according to lcircumstances, is imposed on those who, ' without legitimate cause,' shall have in their shops or warehouses any such adulterated articles. If the adulterated article be in-. 7 mions to health, the fine may be increased to 5f., and the imprisorment tol4 days. "Thefine andimprisonmentlmaybedoubledif a delinnt-has been previously convicted-within five years of bis laset offence. - - "The aduiterated artIcles shall be confiscated, and, if injuirious to health, destroyed. "The authorities may make public announcement of the particulars of the offence by placard and advertisement. "A special ' Ordornancede Police, in navis, applies to the manufacture and sale of confectionery,-and forbids the usse, for colouring, of all- mineral matter gad all poisonous vegetable matter.> Confectioners are required to envelope coloured confectionery in paper markod with their name and address, and are made personaly responsible for accidents arising from the consumption of the articles they sell. Confectioners' shops are to be visited for the purposo of seeingthattheyconform totheseregulations. Asan additional precaution, the 'Conseil de Salubrite' of the City of Paris, abodyconsisting.of eminent physicins, chhymlsts, and other persow, -pubshes i.list of colouring mattera which may be employed byeonfoctioners with instirctions as to the manner of mixing them, and a list of the colour- ing matters the use of hichis expressly forbidden. . - l "li-.- Belgium,a law,, bering date thel7thofMAich j 1856, declares that ali'wFho shall have adulterated, or caused: to be adulterated,- aty articles of feed or drinik intended Dfor sale, shall he liable toen iiuprisoumentfrsn eigXht daysto oue. year, alnd a fine of fromn 50f. to100 o o-etrpaihj - " The penalties are divided into -twb elasses. -T he first {apples topersons who have adulterated, or caused- to be ~adulterated, eatables,} driu,kable liquors, or .any articles of food intended to-be offered for sale, the penalty being, as -nlready stated, fromneight days' to a.

The law aw provides against the adul- ,teration ofoils, against the deceptive packintof. hay, an. ,even against fruds inl Enens and other goods, contaiing fewer yards of measuremcnt than are marked upon them. "In nglandthe lawe affords redress to consumers ircases of adulteration by actioni if the injury be individual in its character ; by indictment, if the injurybe general; by summary charge before a magistrate'; and by proceedings insti,tuted h toe Excise. The process of action or indictment is at once too costly and too, cumbrous for general adoption. That by summary charge before a magistrate, as -well as that originafng with the Excise, applies only to a-few special articles which are named in particular acts, or which are subject to the supervision, 'for fiscal purposes,'ef the`B&rd of Inland Revenue; but your committee are of opinioni that it would be most desirable that, in all cases of the sale of an 'adulterated or flcttioui article, a cheap and easy remedy by summary charge beforeama'wistrate'should -be afforded to 'the person,upon whom'the raud had. been practised, and they woiud strongly recommend the i?ropriety of such a change in the present law on this sub3ect as-would effect this object. - i Your committee desire specially to cal attention to the gmrovisionsof the Bread A ct, 6t and 7th of nIllisÂ±u IV., Shap. 37.

'The act also provides for an appeal to quarter sessions, and declares that no person shall be convicted unless complaint is made within 48 hours after the offence, orwithin such reasonable time as to the justices may seem "Your committee have given the provisions of the Bread Act" intsome'detall, because it seems lo ,hem to comprise much that may be ueful in frAng a meosur applicable to adulterations generally, . " It is impossible to frame any enactment ont this subject which shall rely on stict definitions. The object of thelaw is to strike at fraud, and wherever a fraudulent intention canbe proved, there to infict a 'pemnlty. What constitutes fraudmnust be left to the interpretation of the administrators of the law. Thus mixtures of an innocuous chaacter, made knownby.the seller, or usa for the preservation of the article, cannot be forbidden without danger'to the needful freedom of commerce, and ought not to be interpreted as comingwithin the provisions of a penal law. Nor should those provisions -apply-wherever the seller can afford satisfactory proof thathee as himself been deceived, and was not conscious of t,ho adulteration practised; unless he have evinced a culpable ignoranceof the trade vhich he professes to follov. "'fSubect to these qualifcations, the law- should be clear and positive in forbidding adulteration, andin punishing those who practise it." - "Bitherto the Progress of legislation has not kept pace with the ingenuity of rand, which has not scrupled to avail itself of every improvement i s hymnistry or the arts which eould subeserve its purpose. - - .- - - "Although, howrever, the means of adultertion have, -sreatlyincreased,Pso also, ibstunately, have the facilitiesfor detectioni, especially by the improved use of the microsco,pe, wrhich has been employed- by Dr. Eassal and others with: -signalsuccess- ' " At first, no doubt, some diffic}tywould.be experienced in finding persons qufied to eonduct the required chymical and microsoopical exinations; but the want will soon gnve rie to the needfulsuppl 'This wAnt has been already felt by the Board of nland Rvenue, which has been c6mpelled, for the purposes of -the analysis rtquiaite in cues of adulterated articles of'Excise, to educate persons for this specialduty. In addition to aboat 4,000 officers, scattered over-the country, whose, experience enables them to detect many adulteration, and :to discover 'case of stronr S'ApLcion, the board employs 'bout 60 to 70 analytical chymists, who-% - numbers are recruited -b-ysaidentk -educated for. this purpose at University CUolege% to the number- of 14 in every year. -Mr. Phillips,' the chief officer'of the cbhymidi department:of :the Board -of -Inland- Revenue,:' states Ithat-the practice is for the oficers, if ' they suspect a trader of adulterations, or on information given to them, to fgd' and procure samples; - Many are competent to examine samples on the spot.

And -he adds,' as showing the rbsult of the system adoptetbythi board,- that adIteration Iasbeen totally stopped in some .rticles, and much diminished in' others, from the very fact that traders know they arc liable to inspection by the Excise officers. - - - - "It has been suggested that the prevention of adultera. tionsin food might be' accom sed by an extension of the systesm of the~Board 'of nd R:evenule; but your' commaittee are of opinion that no machinery for this p'urpose wilvork satisfactorilymmleassthe agents employed dlerive their authority from corcorate 'or other local governing bodies. - -.;= 'St wfil be dedrable,qtherefore to empowermunicipal or other local or district authorities to appoint an officer, or Qfficers, who, on complaint made,- orin cares of i-easonable suspicion, shall procure-portions-of any article supposedto be adulterated, with a view to their exauinaiion oranalysis by some duly -quilified-person appointed for' that purpose,' On the report of such persons, if it eoimfirn th'e suspicion of adulteration, a summons shbl be issued 'and the case be investigated before-the justices, who shall have poeire't infict'sanmmary punishment, by fine or imprisoimnent, in every cseaewhere pecuniary: fraud or dinger tohejth-sh&l bv been proved.

THE PUBZrC HEALTH. From the egisrartGeneral's WeeMkyEeturn.) The inhabitants of Yondon are not in an averge' state of - health. 1,250 deaths were registered in the week that nided August 16, whereas the corrected avrage of the corc fesponding eight weeks of previous years, When, cholera was not epidemic, is 1,127. In the second 'week of August, 1S849 and 18i4, cholera was epidemic, and the deaths amounted to 2,230 and ,833. Summer cholera now prevails to a sight extent, and was fatal in 2-2 cases; diarrhcea was fatal in 253 cases. 242 children died of these diseasee under the age of 10; 11 of the adultswere under 60 years, and 22 -were 60 years of age and upwards. Of 1,250 persons of the various stted ages, 760 were under 20 years of age; 150 were of the age 20-40; 145 were 40-60; 15e were 6MOO ; 39 only were of the age of S0 and upwards. 620 of the persons wnose career -was cut short under 60 years of age died either of zymotic diseases or of diseases of-the respiratory orns and conumption. These dieeaes are natural to man, but their ravages are greatly aggravated by the phvsical impurities of. the atmo-' sphere aeen from a distance hanging in a cloud over London.

I ZOADOX, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 20, 185. IUntaught, by his experience of the past, and rckless of what may gccur in the future, the King of NAPIEs has met the remonstrances of France and Great Britain with open defiance.. Is he not aA-- anointed King? Does he not hold a comMissoi fro-m above to worlk his will upon his subjects? Who shall presume to interfere with the action oi a -Monarch whose own Wi is the meaaure of his rights ? To each of the two Government3 reproaches are addressed with all the violence and all the impotence of aMlity. How -c. France, -itholut gross inconsistency, dare to remonstrate vith the King of the Two SiCois upon his treatment of his subjects? How can she cvea venture to point out that the peace of Europe may be compromrised unless he should condescend to alter his policy, -when she herself has so recen*y &apatched her armies to the East to vindicate ihe law of non-interference ? It is for England, lovvever, that the most puissant efforts of the Royal logic are reseived. WhEt would Lord PAWLEtoox may were the King of the Two Sioa.ms to assume for once the mantle of mild. licf3, and to point out t) him the blots which vl^nminmtrmtion in British India or in lieland? Would ho listen- for a mnoment to the -bland remonszrances of the Eavoy, who m5ght be commissioned to distil -into his ears the counsel of his Royal master? Most assuredly not-such is the conclusion of the KÂ±xo: not only would the FIirst Mlinister of England turn a deaf ear to such uliseasonable advice, but -he would on the instant cause his passports to be delivered to the bold diplomatist w ho had dared to tamper with the majesty of Great Britain. Alas for the wretched subjects of the Sicilian Kx !-there is nob one of them who might not -envy the lot of the most oppressed subject of the British Crown, whether in India, or in Ireland, or in any other portion of our dominions. We were not aware that English statesmen, or Englishmen generally, were so punctilious, and if the King of the Two .Sicrms, through the medium of his Envoy to the Court of St. James's, or in any other way that may seem most fitting to himself, will favour us with a few hints for the 'benefit of our Irish, or Indian, or colonial fellow-subjects, we shal feel nothing but gratitude for the kindly motives which prompted his suggestions, and shall be ready to adopt them without reserve. All this, however, is mere trifling. WVhat can such a person as the King of NX&LEs know of the condition of Ireland or of British India, a7nd what cares he about their misery or their prosperity? ' He had resolved not to listen to the remonstrauces of the allies. He cid not wish to reason, but to scold. What he required was not an argument, but a reproach. If the King of NArLEs will select that portion of Ireland or of British India which he may consider the worst governea, and grant to his subjects the same immunities and the same measure of liberty which the most oppressed subjects of the British CMov.N now enjoy, he may hold himself for the future to be secure from all remonstrances from the Western Powers. The question, however, of non-interference, under any circumstances, with the action of a foreign Government in its relations with its own subjects, is another and a more delicate matter. The King of NAPzrs denies the right under any conditions. Whether the position be a tenable one or not for the moment we will not say ; but who made him King? But for the fleets and armies of England in the first instance, and for the joint interference of the allies by various acts of successive Congresses, the present King of NWA?r would be a wandering Pariah in some foreign country, dependent probably upon the commiseration of foreign Governments for his support. Q It is mainly Great Britain that has forced the dynasty of which the present King of the Two SICmES is the representative upon a reluctant people by sheer force of arms. We are in a condition to judge of past counsels by actual events. We can now appreciate the policy of the support given by Great Britain to the Neapolitan BounBONS when the conquering armies of NApOLEOrN had hurled them from the mainland and driven them, under the protection of our flag, to their insular dominion. Not for a week, not for a day, would they have been safe even in that last place of refuge but for the active and constant interference of that Power which is novw warned by the King of the Two SicrLirS not to interfere in Neapolitan affairs, because interference implies a violation of the public lavw of Europe. The question in the abstract of noninterference in the domestic concerns of a 'oreign State may present some difficulties of definition, but in practice a solution is not so wholly unattainable. Without entering upon the general question, it will be sufficient for the moment to establish as a principle that when any particular State is so grossly misgoverned as to endanger a general European conflag-ration other States are justified, for the sake of their own security, in demanding that what is amiss shall be rectified. A private individual has no -imed fame right to enter his neighbours aprtment or his neighbour's house, but if he is informed that his neighbour has laid up a good store of gunpowder, and other combustibles, and is in the habit of casting burning cinders among the barrels for his pastime, it is then high time to abandon the doctrine of non-interference. It is with States as with individuals; even in their dealings with their own subjects independent Governments must consider that without the limits of their own territories there are nations who will not permit their interests to be imperilled. Now, has such a case arisen within the dominons of the King of NAPLES at the present moment? We are well aware that, wit} the exception of the Sardinian possessions, there is not a square mile of the Italian Peninsula which is- not ready for revolt. The first effective rising in any one of the Italian States will set Italy in a blaze from one end to the other. At Naples, and in the Neapolitan provinces, the exasperation is at the highest. Civilians can no longer tolerate the oppressions and espionage of the police. The galleys and prisons are crammed wlith unfortunate er'sons whose crime is that they are suspected of not wishing well to the Government of the King. In the Last place, -we may now say, as it is no secret, that the army itself, with the exception' of the Swiss mercenaries, has been so disgusted with the LNG that the native regiments are, ready to go over to the people on the first outbreak of hostilities. The Neapolitan troops, as far as the Government can contrive it, are disseminated about in various fortresses> where they are rather the watched than the watchers. ln the city of Naples itself they are placed under the surveillance of the Swiss. Swiss and Neapolitan regiments are ready to exchange, not to unite, fire on the first convenient opportunity. lt is uncLer these circumstances that tha Ming of NAPLrs has thrown down his gauntlet in the face of the Western Powers. He is literally depending for his tenure of power from day to day on the support of the Swiss regiments in his employ, and on the Lazzaroni of the capital. 3a cae of any outbreak the Knh'G win let loose the Swis and the Lazzaroni on the town, with license to work their will, so "order be restored at Naples." What effect this threat may produce we know not, but such calculations as these, when too publicly announced, are not unconmonly stultified by the event. What other resources the King of NAPLs may have at his disposal we know not, unless, indeed, he has received assurances of sympathy and aid from Austria, in violation of the public declarations of that, Iower. The real strength, however, of the King of the Two SICES lies in hiis absolute weakness. The presence of two French and two English line- of-battle ships in his bay would be sufficient to insure his absoIute destruction. The Powers can pass no other sentence than that of deposition ; therefore it is they hesitate, and would rather leave the King of NAPILs to his better reflections or to the justice gf his subjects. If it be yet time, -and it is not quite clear that time is left,-we str ongly recommend the Km-G to reconsider his determination. He need not speak, after all, with such disgust of the constitution, for he swore to it. He need not hold up the principle of foreign interference to such entire execration, for foreign interferene replaced his family upon the throne of the Two Siciliee We shrewdly suspect that it is not incumbent upon the Western Powers to take any very active steps in this matter. It is ufficient that it should be known. throughout the. Two Sicilies that France andEngland are not in the least disposed to assist in rivetting the chais Ihich their KING has I and the-event Ma&y be 1,.: to man's isticts ad Ithe turmof thebua-glu. 11 - .

*Teevacuation' o'f Turk b th key by the aIlics- will possibly prove to be the turning. poiiit'in the modern history of that empire. 'The great tl is now to begin; we are to learn if the grounds on which We have restored the Ottoman State to independence are tenable, end if the promises which its sponsors have made are likely to be fulfilled Soon not asingleforeignsoldier willtreadtheTurkish soil; the SULTAN and his advisers will be perfectly unfettered, and may congratulate themselves on a .position beyond their highest hopes three years since.. For a oentury and a half no Turkis4 ruler has been so po-werful as ABDux MDIDJI. He cannot, it is true, threaten Vienna or scour the Mediterranean with a' fleet, but he is the undisputed master of the most fleiely placed empire on the globe, of regions which ouly require the labour of man to raise them,to the height of wealth and fertility. No independent Viceroys, no rebellious pashasweaen his authority. His Christian allies have understood the word "sovereignty" in their own sense, as the possession of supreme, indefeasible rights; and Tunis, TripoliA and Egypt, Servia, MJontenegro, and the Danubian Provinces. rer fully submitted to his sway, scarcely saving the local iprivileges accorded to them in old times. It is said that the Sun, evinced both surprise and anger on !earning that the new decree in favour of the Christians was to be seriously carried out, and even forbade from his presence the GRAND VrzR, whom he held responsible for gaining his assent tinder false pretences. Tf this be correct, it shows in what manner a party at Constantinople interpreted the late war. Everything was to be done for the ruling Power, and all reciprocal obligations were to be forgotten the moment safety and independence were achieved. Tne politicians of the capital will not be slow to turn what is caUed 44 reform", to their own advantage. Theymost assuredly care nothing for the philanthropic wishe3 of the Western nations; they probably cannot even understand them. That people two thousand miles away should trouble themselves about the welfare of races from which they can expect no immediate return is enough to puzzle the generality of Mlussulman officials. They will ask themselves the motive of all this sympathy,-vhat is to be gained by it? and, unless they discover a solid reason, they will conclude that it is assumed, and, though quite ready to bear a part in the play, they will soon show how unreal they consider it. NOW, it is quite uncertain whether any direct improvement will take place in the lot of the Christian population and the poorer classes generally on account of the late firman; but there can be little doubt that if the Westem Powers press for its execution the ruling body at Constantinople will endeavour to turn it to a means of extending their power and making the whole empire more inumediately subject to themselves. In Turkey, as in other countries, equality will be made an excuse for centralization; not that the new official whio governs as the shadow of the Minister will be less selfish and grinding than his predecessor, who, throagh custom and the distance of hiis province, was able to set up a kind of independent authority and tyrannize in a rougher fashion than is consistent with modern usages; but everything will now be done in a more regular manner. Of yore, perhaps, no accounts were kept; now they wil be ready to the day, but civilization will ha-re introduced the skill by which they may be made to veil even more than former delinquencies. No man will be openly plundered, as formerly, but those who do not propitiate the governing power will find themselves unsuccessful in all their enterprizes, and the new system will be somiething too artful for the ordinary European Consul of the locality to expose. It seems to be allowed, as stated by our Constantinople correspondent, that the direct government by the PORTE has not benefited the subject provinces. No empire except England has so many various races under its sway requiring so much judgment for their control. We can hardly wonder, therefore, that the strings of all these Administrations cannot be held in the Council-room at Constantinople. The old government by Pashas, who held their places for many years at a time, was a species of self-government, inasmuch as the ruler generally identified himself in some measure with the people he -was among. Provincial officers, provincial lawyer-, servants born in the pasha'ic, all made himi in a short tme acquainted with the country and interested in its wants. If it grew rich, he could build up a larger fortune; if. it grew powerful. he was a greater man in the eyes of his master and of his brother Pashas. He therefore, not unnaturally, gave play to the local energies; and, if he were an able man, the province prospered in its own primitive way. But now the provincial ruler is a niiuch less exalted personage. It is, no doubt, better for the empire as a wh6ce. There is no chance of intestine war. Never again can there be an Art PAsHm of Janina or a 3mzizET Ai of Egypt. The new Govcrnor is often a poor servile hanger-on of one of the great Pashas of the PouRT, for it is now seldom that a man of property is appointed, least of all to a district where his own possessions lie. He goes, having borrowed money of Armenian bankers, on the desperate chance of makdng a fortune. He may be recalled in a few months, and plunged in obscirity; he may be raised to some loftier post. The latter is always his great aim, and he only looks on the office which he holds as a step to something more. No superior political knowlede balances this great defect. He is not a sialful administrator ana souna economist despatehed from the capital to establish civilization in a half-feudal province, but merely a selfish and ignorant adventurer, superior in noteing to the old school of Pashas, and inferior to them in independence of character and a certain interest in the well-doing of their resective provinces. - It may weUl be said that reform is uged on. too fast, if it be sought to reduce the heterogeneous Ottoman empire to the administrative pattern of France or Prussia. We shall probably soon understand, what nearly every one conversant with the East has declared, that the Turldsh imitation- of European. forms is but a shallow and superficial civilization. . The capital, the Ministerial depart*ments, even the army, may benefit by the adoption of the- institutions which prevail in Europe ; but it is impossible that the people as a mass can be. governed by usages to which they are utterly unaccustomed. To denationalize even the races of the East must be to lower them and impede their progress. Sclaves and Albanians, Turks, Greeks, Arabs, and Africans, cannot aJl be brought in a day under one form of administration, however elastic and prudently carried out. Provinces separated from each other by distance and difficulties of conumunication must for many years longer require for their development men conversant with their wants, and intereated in studying their respective capabilities. Such men the centralized Stamboul system cannotproduce. Even English Governors of colonies are apt to display much pedantry and ignorance for the first twelvermonth that they pass in a new part of the globe, and ara often orly well acquainted with their duties iwhen it is time to quit their, posts. We cannot wonder, then, that provinces wither under the sway of the needy, uneducated, and constautl changing Stun- boul offlicals. It iu evideut that the regeneratioa, -of Turldai state i3a niore compjlex problni~ :n either Europeana or niatives are wilng tbe lieve, and we.niuchkfear that even the gobd iutentions of reformers are likely to cause evils hardly less than those gast- &~ hi -ekorts ta . is aailtwhich they directtheir
The "Report of the Select- Committee of the "House of Commons on the Adulterstion of Food"' is now before us. The following paragraph appears to sum up the conclusions 'which the committee has arrived at "Ilf, as regards the aduteration of articles sith-sibstances of a cheaper-and innocuous character, the pubV4c derive the full benefit of this cheapuess in a lower price, it 'would be dinicult if not unwise, for the Legislature to interfere, unless it could do soby requring that every smch article be sold as a mixture, as disinguiahed from the articlo in its pure state. -Bnt whenever, an article is so adulterated as to involve pecuniary fraud or injury to health, it appears to your. committee to be the duty of the egilature to provide some eficient remedy."' It will be observed that this paragraph, though cautiouslyworded,ddoes not're'comniend the application, of legisative intereuce to.adulteration itself. The committee does not appear to object to simple adulteration--. e., to selling an arhiclei under.the name and profession of being the genuine article, while it is not such really, but a mixture of -the genuine article . with various -other substances. This :is -what, in cormmon parlance, is meant by adulteration, and in this 'the. committee sees no criminalitv, though' it hiuts, that the Legislature might impose upon the seller the use of some mark to distinguish such mixed article from the genuine-not that it goes so far as to reconmend even this. So far the report seems to represent certain opinions of a particular section of the committee. which come out very prominently in the proceedings. Great efforts were made by some members of the committee .to get this whole question of adulteration regarded strictly according to the rules of political economy, ancd treated simply as a question of supply and demand. It was assumed that the public could tell a genuine article from a mixed one, and that they preferred a mixed one because it was cheaper, and, upon that assumption, the inference was muade that, after all, the seller, of mixed or adulterated articles only met the wishes of the public, in the kind of article he sold. The public had rather have a cheap article mixed than a dearer one genuine, and they got what they wanted; there was no pecuniary fraud in such a transaction. The mixed article was sold at the market price of the different materials of which it was composed, so that the purchaser received what was worth the money he gave. All this view of the case followed, or was, supposed to follow, from the assumption just mentioned; but we must beg leave to doubt the truth of that assumption. We doubt whether the public agrees to buy, or thinks in the act of purchase that it is buying, a mixed article. A man goes into a shop to buy a loaf of bread, or a pot of marmalade, or a pound of coffee, or an ounce of cayenne. He may know that mixture and adulteration are common enough in these articles, and that therefore he runs the risk himself of buying them' mixed and adulterated; but we deny that he consents to that mixture, or that there is any understanding between him and the seller to that effect. He wants the genuine article, and if an article is sold to him as the genuine one which is adulterated he is cheated. The committee distinguish in the paragraph we have quoted between simple adulteration and adulteration which involves " pecuniary fraud," aud assume that there is only "pecuniary fraud" when the mixed or adulterated article is sold at a higher price than the inferior substances vith 'which it is mixed would bring in the market,-that is to say, they only allow fraud to consist in charging more for an article than its component materials are actually worth. But is there not fraud in calling an article what it is not, and selling it as genuine when it is really mixed? It will be said, "Oh ! the "public virtually know' this; they know that if "articles were really genuine they would have to "pay more for them, and they would not like to "have to pay more; so they are sucbstantially "responsible for the present composition of these "articles." But we reply, in the first pLace, that this is certainly not trtue of one portion of the public. The classes that can afford to buy the genuine article want to have it, but the present system prevents them. However willing they may be to pay for it, it is not to be had for love or 3noney. Here is an obvious injustice, then. A man wants to. buy g-enuine coffee, and he buysy coffee mixed with chicory, roasted wheat, beans, and mangoldwurzel. It is very poor consolation to him to be informed that he has got the chicory, roasted wheat, beans, and mangoldwurzel at the proper market price of those substances; for even if he has got them under the market price he is illused, because he did not want them at any price. So the potato and other starehes which are mixed with his arrowroot may have been sold at their fair market price, but that is n1o compensvtion to hi3m. This class of purchasers, then, is certainly ill-used by the present system. In the next place, if there is any portion of the public so ill off that it had rather have a mixed article at a lower price than a-pure -one at a higher, this, at any rate, ought not to be taken for granted 'without giving the purchaser a choice in the matter. But, according to the present system, he has no, choice; he must have either the mixed artiek or none at all. All this is the more important because aduleration is sure to grow and increase, so that, if what the committee calls " innocuous' adulteration is allowed, pernicious adulteration is sure to go along with it; and it must be remembered, too, hor absolutely the pyublic are at the mercy of shopkeepers in these matters. The. rule of caveat eiaptor would be a very unfair one to apply rigidly in such 'cases. -How is a man, when he goes into a shop, to know a spurious article from a genuine one ? The seller has him in his power, unless, indeeed, every man is to be compelled to keep a chymist in ordinary, to take with him on his shopheepingg roands aiid test every article he buys. It' may be said the poor want cheap aricles, and that cheap articles mrust be adulterated ones ; and the defender of "innocuous?' adulteration nay use this argument for the conlaUson he anives at; but how can you check adulteration when it begins; and when it has outgrown the harmless limit, and become poisonous, Who are' so absolutely the victims of 'this worst and most fatal hind of adulteration as the poo? T they are simply at the mercy of the shopkeeper in the village or the nearest market town. They have no choice but to buy what is placed before, them, and. cannot change their chymist or their grocer, as their. 'wealthier neighbours can, or send up to London for' their goods. They are, in fact, in the hands of that class of tradesmen' who are least under: the influence of public opinion, and who are most tempted to. make theeir way: by the low arts and tricks of trade. At the same time too much' must not be expected from legislation in the way of cure for these grievances and protection to the purcIasor. A standing board of HA&ssALLs, who -would punish the fraudulent by publishing their: names, 'ould, perhaps, be a better security to, the public against the dishonesty of tradesnieik than any legislative penalty.

Nor did-the day grow better as it grew older; a black squaUl from the north-eastsweeping up the Medway and rustling through.the -trees and bushes gave.ominous indication of a coming storm. Towards noon the sky became completely.overcast, and soon, to use the language of the Crystal palace Compa ny, "the' whole -system of waterwerks W2as5iifull<. play." But th^is, unfortanate condition of t. the,. weather . did not impede the progress of the. mimic siege nor damp the ardour of -those lwh-o were engaged in it. Independently of the troops who kept the ground, and wh6 were for the most part recruiits of the Royal Sappes and Miners, ,there. were assembled within the lines about: 2,700 rank and file, of whom 1,0O0 :were- Sappers, -and 600 Royal Marines, while the remainder constituted the, Provisional Battalion.'. Colonel . Savage and Colonel Sandham commanded the Sappers, Colonel PhiMips the Mfarines, and Colonel Jervis the' Provisional Battalion, while the command in chief devolved on: Colonel Eden, who is at the head of the garrLson. The Provisional Battalion was.composed of the depGtsof thefollowingregiments:-5th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 24th, 26th, 27th, 29th,. 32d, 35th, '37th, 40th, 43d, 45th, 53(3, 56th, 60th Rifles, (1 st, 6lth, 70th, 74th, 75th, 78th, 81st, SSd,' 84th, 86th; 87sth. The troops -were all iinder arms at half-past llo'clockF, and afterbeing inspected by their conmasnding offlcers were paraded on the reviewvgroundadjoiningthe:EntB3arracl, where they received .instructions from Colonel Saudham, R.E. The D keof Cambridge, whowore the undress uniform of a general-officers arrived from 'London at 12 o'cloclk, in company with General Sir J. Burgoyne, I.C.13. His Royal Righness was attended by his aides-de-camp, Major Clifton and Colonel Gordon; Sir J. Burgoyne, by Captain Stopford. Having spent. soime little time -vith the Commandant, the Duke repaired to the North Parade, where he was received by a guard of honour of the Sappers, the goat and the camel which share the foitunes of that scientific corps being also in attendance to give him welcome. At 1 o'clock the troops were all assembled within the lines, and then ensued a series of movements designed to illustrate -various stages and processes in the rival arts of assailing and defending fortresses. Rand grenades and stones were collected in great quantities near the mortars inside the right branch of St. Mary's Eornswork. Sods and deal tompions also -were Upplied in abundance, and each man was provided with 10 rounds of blank cartridge. The gans were ranged in battery, and manned by the Royal Marine Light Infantry. The siege operations were conducted with extraordinary rapidity First a pary of the Line from the Provisional Battalion, unIder the direction of Captain Walker, Ioyal Engoineers, went through the escalading exercise against the right face of Prince Henrs Bastion, -with 20 ladders, the 10 in advance being placed against the escarp, and 10 against the counterscarp. A covering party formed on the crest 'of the glacis to the right and left of the ladders, but did not open iheir lre. When the ladder parties had crossed the ditch the covering party followed and the whole formed within the bastion. They then recrossed the ditch in reverse order-viz., 1st, the covering party who took up their orig,ial position on the crest of the glacis; 2d, the counterscarp ladder party who drew their ladders from the ditch and ground them at the foot of the glacis; 3d, the escarp ladaer party who followed and brought theirladders across the ditch, ascending the countersarp and forming their ladders in second line at the foot of the glacis, wvhere the ladders were left until the operations of the day were concluded. Captain' Walker conducted the party to the left of the attadk, and posted them in the parallels and advanced works and lodgnments in connexion with the troope of the garrson already distributed in the works of the attac. - The' double sap, the great descending gallery, and the two single saps were under the direction of Major Sed ey, Lieutenant Bullen, and Ensign Jones. After these -works had been inspected a fire was cemmenced from the batteries, parallels, and rifle pits, by solnd of bugle. The men were then withdrawn from the lodgment in -front of the Redan, and the lodgment was destroyed by the mines of the garrison, fired by a voltaic battery in charge of Captain Scott. The next operation was the construction of a pontoon bridge formed by rafts, under the command of Lieutenant Phillips. This singular craft, which started into existence as if by magic, was rowed up under the rigit bank of St. Mary's creek=, across the mouth of the ditch of St. Mary's hornwork. As soon as the pontoon bridgewas formed a party of 12 Sappers, under Captain Brine, Lieutenant Storer, and Ensign' Thackery, with bags of powder, and with filled sandbags for tamping, preceded by a covering party, advanced from the lodgment on the extreme right of the attack, followed by a party of 100 men of the provisional battalion, crossed the pontoon bridge, and proceeded along the glacis in front of the hornwork *until they reached the stocade. The coveringl parthy then lay down, 'but did not fire. The Sappers passed through them, placed the powderbags against the stockade, and covered them with the sandbags. Captain Brine tien ordered the parties to retire, and, having ignited the fuse,- joned the parties, and retired with them to the head of the bridge. A party of Sappers, under the charge of lTeutenantMitchell, protected by General Blanshard's iron mantlets, then quitted the same lodgments. formed on the crest of the glacis, and covered the party told off to form a bridge with General Blanshard's Infantry pontoons, across the wet ditch of the right branch of St. Mary's hornwork. Ensign Thackery established two ladders against the counterscarpfor the formation of the bridge, and LieutenantR. M. Smith laced two ladders agains he escarp resting on the head of the bridge as soon as it wass formed. Rethen sent ulp two men with lilaooks to cut an opening in the quicksetnhedge on the "berme," by wrhich the escalade was effected. While these operations were going on, iAeutenant Anderson, wit Lieutenant Brwoke, took charge of an escalading party of eight ladders, carried bGySappers, four for the escarp and four for the countencarp, -which noved out from the right of the lodgment in front of the Redan, and eacaladed at' the point where the embrasures of the ramr crossed eacij other. When the explosion aga=nst tlhe stockade had taken place a parlty of' Sappers, --with crowbars and axes, advanced from the head of the pon- I toon bridge, followed by the min body at 4'the i double," and cleared the breach in the stockade to enable 'themi to -pass through it. IBnslly, the troops having gained the inside of the works were formed in coetiguous columns of corps. The Provisional Battalion and the Royal Marines LIght Infantry then marched back to their barrac. Throt hout all these diEcult' operations the men displayea preci mn a d . celerity 'of mo*ement tat evoked niversal dmition. The quielc measurement of distanes, the rapid, sidlful, and unexpected concentration of forces -upon particular . point the. coolness andthe ciencewhich give to war its chief grandeur and power, wem al represented with a vividnsss' and a splendour of effect which might 'kidle a spark of martial enth'asiasm' eve' in the' pacific breasts of those who, 'like Casio, "1Never set a squadron in the field, -'Nor the division of a battle ]now " fore thai'a'siiatr."i After the other troops had retired the Sappers still lingered in the scene of' their glory, and made soome experiments in pnooning which evideneod .emarkable ingenuit, and a singulr genius both for constructiveness and destrutiveness. With almost the rapidity of' thought they " boomed" out their planks and, rolleiS, and formed them into bridges, which in. another .initant they- took to pieces and dismantled, and then again converted Taekinto bridges It Was impoEsible to watch the operations of 'this most ingenious corpis wth out perceiving how wonderful is' the progru t;t hs been made . of Iate yeas in the art of pontooning.- oE- ie Penin- r -W.-,Wa bge-iw little, mxore ~~~~~St-bantumber.-d -boit heai.yauiI sumbentied tgated.." yh.w"r, and lialei any nioment to:rp.

THE LATB DISYU?BA?CES AT LISBON. - -~ ~ . i, ~. (FR3M OUR OWN COPB oNDxM-T.) LISBO2, AUG.- 11.0 The bread riots'whichcommencedhereire nightssince were resumned last night, 'being Sunday and, a leisure day,'upon amore extensive icale, and, unless more energetic steps be taken to supprew them,they are likely to assume an alarmng aspect. The principal points of attack have been theprivate residence of Mr. Eugenio de Almida aud his steam-mills anc bskery, 'which are situated at different extremities of the town, and last night therioters seemeh to have divided themselres into three groups. One took up a central position, Gold-streetb anotherattacked the privateresidence; whUletheth-ira proceeeded to the bakery,which was already under the protechon of a detachment of the Municipal Guards and consequently escaped the conflagration with which it had been threatened. I amnot. aware whether Mr. Almeida was actually at home when his house was attacked, but the rioters were told that he had gone on board ship, and that his vife and children alone remained in the house. The. mob broke down the iron- gates, and, having got into the yard which give-s admittance to the house, had broken the windows and set lire to the door,. when. the fire bells were tolled, and the engines coming up the street under the protection of troops, the mob was dispersed by the cavalry, who used their swords, but were careful to do little damage - andl amalsotoldtheinafantry formedcto chargewith. the bayonet. As respects the rioters who had collected in Gold-street, they appear to have dono little more than give vi7sa to the Ring and cry " Down with the monopolists !" until a body of Municipal Cavalry appeared, 'when they formed across the street, and presented a front,. which led the cavalry to halt, and brought on a parley, during which the Mfarquis of Loul6, Presi-r dent of the Council of Ministers, appeared, and endeavoured to-persuade the mob that the Govern-' ment had taken every-possible step to reduce the price of bread and other provisions, by decreeing their free admission. Ile aso assured them the King' was coming from Cintra, and that all further praeticaLmeasureswouldbe adopted, if they would only have patience, and dispee. It .appears the Marquis's arguments haWd ^no influence upon the, mob>and that he 'was little less successful wben he requested the Municipal Cavalry to disperse them by force. It seemed pretty clear that such foroe could not be -relied upon, as too many of the men were sufferers in their own families, and Sympa-. thized with the people, with whom they mIght have: fraternized had force been actually resorted to. I am told by an eye-witness that one of the mob had' actually cocked his piatol to fise at the MIarquis of LouI6 when he rode off. I ame not aware that the rioters in Golicstreet did any f rther mischief than attaking a couple of bakers' sl~ in the neighbour-. hood, after which they seem to have been led in, E'diferent directions to join their companions at Mhfr. lmeeida's house and bakery, -where tneir disappominment at the little which had been done naturally iduced the whole to disperse, and; before morning the streets were free from the' rioters, the public squares and buildings havimg been occupied during the 'whole night by troops of the Line, including cavalry, infantry, ad - arillery,'which ill have to 'be used more activey: if these dang,erouls proceedings are not. to produce perfect anarchy in the capital. At the moment I 'write f-he Mrinisters have gone to the Palace to meet the King in council Reports say that political partisans stir up these riots to upset the Government, but nothing clear has yetbeen proved upon that head, and I suppose the high price of 3a. per lb., which the poor people have to pay for their bread, is the principa3 cause of the riots, whieh wre, as is often the case, directed - against those who are doing the greatest benefit to the people. lMr. Eugenio de Almeida is the pesn who sells the -eheapest bread in the capital, and his establishment has had the effect of neutralizing the monopoly heretofore exising among the bakers, who combined to keep up high prices when not justfied by the vue of gra. Inthe present instance, however, the price of bread is in proportion to that of grain, which is high, not only on account of badc harvedts in this country, but the impossibility of importing wheat from other places at lower rates, unless the merchant be expected to import without profit, or even at a loss. AUGUST 12. I avail myself of the steam-transport Baffalo to send vou a copy of the letter I wrote yesterday by ller lMjatey's steamer Seahorse respectingw the bread riots,'which, I trulst, havec now been completely checked by the enery of the Government and the mniitar. There is no doubt the Municipal Guard, particularly the infantry, was disposed to fraternize with the rioters, and therefore a deree was issued yesterday by the King in-council, placing the whole of that body temporaily under the Count da Ponte de Santa Maria, 'who acts as Commnander-in-Chief of the army in the absence 'of the Dulke of Saldanh. It was also decreed that all groups of 10 persons oi upwards should be dispersed by force, or captured after 15 minutes' notice. While these -measre were being adopted and printed yesterday. theziotoo,_reckniz'-upo tse- pasMIvezIRS of the M1unicipal Guard, Iihd begn to collect in difieret streetsand squares, but thoy were completely disapesed in the evening by the troopa whicb^l hd replaced' the Municipal Guard. and by 10: oelock the town was even quieter thaii usual, as the, peaceable portion of the inhWbitants'were as anxioiaas the mob to remain at bome. The troops made no ceremony in using their swords aiid' muket% with the rabble, for tie rioters wrere litte el*se, and tranquillity Ws restored at the expense of a few' sabre cuts, which are in no case likely to prove mortal, as far as I canlearn. It is said Lr. de Eugeio Almeida, whoie bakery andhouse had beentheprincipal ob*je of attack, hastal-en out a passport to6leavo the country, and that, he has taken refuge at the American legation, but I thinlk he may now' saely return home, and resume his bakdng, which w suspended l night. ' - It is still said that the rabble were instigated by political intrigue, and, although nothing positive has been proved upon the subject, it is posible that each of t he parties aspiring -to office, as well as the Miglites, who are always redy to disturb the Goverunment, mnay have }lad its ptsans among the rioters to instigate them and avai of the onfuision to promote their owu plan; but all such are nol4' trust, -fully cheeked. Should any more roupa appear, I believe they will be unceremoniou y dispersed, hich is all that a required to keep this naturaly quiet capital completey taqUiL . The Sing Dom.

Every window cornmanding the nivur from Piatnoy to Chiawls had its full complemenxt of Occupant; each bhasn, despite the mad,'which was ankIe d'eep, was thickly lined, and no' a trecon. eitheraside -at bad its grateful knot of shelter-seAkers.- The water par-ties, too, wer nuvmerous; eve description of river craft, from 3ha aristocratic gig to the blaffbo wed,'capacious jolly boat had been put into requisition, and towards the cloea of ihe day, when the turn of the tide had brought down unany parties from Hanmeramith,- there was a thick fringe of boats two or three rows deep on each cido the river for some distance above Patneybridge. Of coulrse thescene was-ndt so gay and variedas it would have been had the sun. been of the party. The fair sen did not muster so strong, end those Indies who did venture forth bad, naturaly-enough, contented themselves with their most sombre toieces. Oilskirn capes and pea coats seemedtobetheprevailingcostume, and,-thoughno One present could deny their' utility and fitness for the occasion, they did notaddmuchtothepicturesquenessofthescene. Every boar, too, which hand not an awning displayed a forest Orn umbrllas, and, had there been much of a wind, the cons`e-U1nces of carring too much sail would have been unpleasantly- demcnstrated in very many cas2s.- In spite of thaee drawbacks, however, there was no lack of enjoyment. Everybody seemed to have come out with a determination to make the best of it; and from behind the sheltering ginghams -there came Occasionally loud bursts of- laughter, - which intimated pretty clearly that the merry hearts vwthin wero but- littire borce down by- -what halosophera call "the eDternal 'indluences." It -would far cifhicult, perhaps, to say what share- ceran capacious, round-bellied bottles, which told their ovin tale, an:d v,hich appeared to circ4ulate pretty freely, had in this hxilarity; but, as there were no capsizes, and as there were no encounters more serious than the usual and allowable contests of river wit, it is only fair to supposesaore particularly as the ladies appeiad to drink fair with ine rest-that these only conltained judicious repellants of wet and cold. OL thoe Middlesex side, off the Bichop of Tiondon's grounds, was moored a steamer for the reception of the subscriers and visitors invited by the committee of management, and a German band stationed on board did its best to enliven the day. Here, too, were displayed in sight of all, on a raised st=ad, the various prizes which were to he contended for. tt -was, indeed, unfortunate that the weather should have Lean Eo miserable, for the committee, by dint of untiring asertions, have succeeded in producing a programme fully equalto that of any former year, and w-hich gave promise of excellent sport Yesterday's list contained no le.s than 16 races, including g1ntlemen's sculls, watermen's apprentices' sl, watermnen's pairs, gentlemen's four oars, and gentlemen's pair oar UP,s. Up to 5 o'clock the course sm from Putney to Chiswick Eyot foifour oars, and from Putney to aammnersmith bridge for the pair oars and sculls, and after the turn of the tae which took place about that time, from Iammersmith to Putney. The rowing was excellent throughout, some of ae races, particularly in the final heats, being very closely contested. One of the best races of the day was the "tlemnen's pair oar, which was rowed down the river lromn lananersmith. A foul ensued soon after starting, but Messrs. Nottidge nnd Chapmar, in whose favour the umpire gave it, waived the advantage, and agreed to pull the race through, as though nothing had happened. This was off the Crab-tree, and both started well together thence, ss fine race foUowed, Messrs. .Nottidge and Chapman having, however; a fair lead until opposite the committee bage, 'when their opponents, apparently calculating on their beirn dead beat, put on a magnificent "spirt," and almost nucceeded in passing them. The event wazs some moments doubtful, but the victory rested with Messrs. N2ottidge znd Chapman, who may thus be said to have achieved a double triumph, first by their generosity, and next by their chill and prowess. The final heat of the Watermen's pair-oar race, in old fahioned boats, was finely rowed, terminating in favour of Cole and Driver. There was but one four-oar race in the day's programme, which was won by the London Clu-b, their Only antagonists being the Albion Club. It was a tight contest, however, and it was not until they reached 3Hnmmersmith-bridge that the London drew away from their rivals, and it seemed to be a general opinion that, had the Albion boat - been steered by a moro experienced .eoxain, the contest would have been even more severe. The rowing of the watermen's apprentices was hiihly applanded, the final heat being decided in favourof G =Ummerton, who rowed with grtat pluck and nigour. The course was well kept throughout by the river police, who seemed to be ubiquitous, and who, by their excellent rArrangements, no doubt prevented many accidents.

At lI.SO precisely the startiag-gurn was fired, the signal having been previously made for the yachts to proceed to the eastward towards the Nab Light, with a nice breeze blowing from the northward, and it was truly surprising to see the- speed with which the Thought was underway. In an instmat she showed her bowsprit ahead, up went the mainsail, and after that her topsail, and in about two minutes after starting she had bhot considerably ahead of her rivals. The Extravaganza was well upto her work, but, although a vessel of vary superior tonnage, sho was by no means so quick in her movements as her leading competitor. The Hesperus and Haidee brought up the leeway; keeping at a very respoctful distance astern of the others.

1?HRPRQP6??ED Y1?71YJ7BRSZO2? OPiPHE BIBLR?-? TO TEBB EDI)Tbll OP(FE I Sir,-You have published two lett froim-- Dri ean. ming,-. n which he states the objections he- enteains t a "new siraelatien oli the Bible^."- He . as iithe music and-rhythni of our puesent translation would b, destroyed by such a rec6nst ction as h4 contemplatei, it is evdert thorefore, that lie imears an- entire recasting of the whole work. It is to be hoped and presumed that no sincere member o'f the ,Church of England or lover of tho Mngish toue would desiro such a inew trnislation. .But the admitted and undeniable errors of our authorized version: may be. corrected without any unnecessary.and sacrilegious disturbance of the incomparable beauty. Of its general style and- language. And - such a re-, vision seems to he- demanded by weiglhty ad i un., amswerable reasons. Dr. Cumminig's first letter con?, sist of .a panegyrio on our present translation, and. on the divines wvho published it in 1611; and very fewpeople, I suppose, could object,to this panegyric. His second. letter contains-suecimens of false translation Jin the Donau, andcertain-Baptist and Unitarian-versions; and none but, al.oman,Catholic, or Baptist,. or Unitarian, wouldobject. to his, criticisum. Bat Dr. Cmnming draws the illogicalconclusion that, because other translatiions are certainly-in. correct-7nay, contain- the most scandalous and disgracefulerrors, inasmuch as G-od's inspired word has been falsified to serve party purposes, therefore the Church of Englandis not to give the world the -blessing of- as perfect atrandala; tion of -the Bibl! as she can. At- no time were the -clergy in general more remarkable ,for critical -ability and sound philological knowledge; and therefore there never was a, tihe when- a revision of the authorized translation of the Bible could hare beeuundertaken ithso much safety and advantage as the present, aind such a revision is undoubtedly demanded by the advanced intelligenra and learning of the laity. Iam awain of-the objection usualy taken:-"If yoihavea revision of the Bible, the Socinian, or'tho Baptist, ortlie Roman Catholic, will gain by it; better leave well. alone." - In answer I say if the Baptist or any one else will g.m an advantage by tbe publication of the truth, he is entitled to it, andought to have it. Promotion of thetruth can and must be tfie only object contemplated by a revision of the trans.' lation of the Bible. The Church of England is founded- on thetruth,--by the truth she must stand; and no admission coald be made more adverse to-lihr genuine spirit or more perilous to her existence than the admission that she was afraid of the truth. But to say that the Church of Eang land is unwiling to revise her version of th Bible becauso ' 'he fears the consequences is libellonsy to accuse her of fearing the truth. - * I the errors contained in our authorized version were much fewer and less important then they really are,- yet, surely, a proper reverence for God's revealed word ought imperatifely to require and enforcetheirremoval. Nothingless than an extreme case of dificulty or necessity can jus. tify a Protestant churcn in allowing a single avowed and. notorious error to be propagated in the name of divine truth. But the errors of our translation are numerous and important. I speak more'especi ally of the translation of the NewTestament. No one who has not'critica3ly and accurately compared thetranslation with the original-nay, who ha not takenthe troubleto mark down the cases oferroneoustranslation-canhave anyideaof their number. Theseerrors areoften of vital importance-e.g., several texts in the Epistles of St Paul speak of the divinity of our Saviour inthe mostpositive terms, yet the force and' meaning of them -is entirely lost in our mnis-translation. And when Dr. Cumming justly nrges - against Unitarians and others that their translations favour their respective tenets, is he not aware that they retaliate and charge our version, in several passages, with a leaning to Calvinism ? It is not at all surprising that there are errors in our translation of the New Testament.' It would be much more sorprising if there were none, for our version is mainly a translation of the Latin Vulgate, which is itself a very imperfect translation of the origial Greek. The want of a definite article in the - Latin language has of itself been. the cause of. a large and important cla3 of mis-translntions in the autho. rized version. And does'Dr. Cumming vish to see an instance of the mischief produced by the falso translation of a single word? Let me refer him to 1. Cor., xi. 29, where the word- plya is translated damnation." But the Greek word -could hardly have been so translated; our tianslators must have had the Latin word doamnia. tiovemn before them. The false translation of this single word has done more to hinder the laity from partalking of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper than all other causesput together. -: Two centuries and X half. aÂ£o, when our translation was published, no collation 'of the manuscripts of the Neow Testament had taken place. The tftus re7eptus was not and could not be a sound and correct text. Tho materials had not been collected for making one. - Since that time the labours: of hEIU, Bentley, Wetstein, Griesbach, Lash main, Tischendorf> Tregelles, and others, in the examina.- tion and comparison of immense multitudesof manuscripts, have rectified the text to such a degree that upon this ground alone a revision of our present translation has be. come not only advisable but necessary. Iam aware of the objection :-Supposing a revision of the present translation .to be published by authority of the Church, what is to be. come of the immense number of copies of 'the present translation now extant? My answer is, if the. revised translation ihould be a manifest and undeniable improvement on the old, it wiUl naturallyandprogressively displace the old one now in use, just as the translation of 1611 displaced all that had preceded it; for there vwere of course translations in existence-a fact which should ba borne in mind by those who seem to think that the present translation ought never andaon no- account to be improved. I know- it is said the clergy are aware of the errors which exist in the present version, and they can' and do occasionally point them out in the pulpit. But-when an error is sopointed 'out, the one of two things occurs-every unlearned member -of the congregation, who thinks seriously, wil either CQntinue to believo his Bible right, and will therefore conceive some degree of dishonour for his ministers judgment; or he will believe his minister, and, as a natural- consequenee, will feel disposed to doubt the - accuracy of his Bible in general; and this is one of the worst evils produced by errors in our translation. A'general insecurity and suspicion, and in many cases an indifference, is begotten in the minds of those 'who ae intelligent, acute, and inquisitive, but who have not a knowvledge of the original Greek, by which thev might satisfy their own judgment. Meanwhile the gainsayer and infidel derive an immense advantage from the present state of things, for when a pas. sage is quoted by an unlearned but earnest opponent against' any one of their - tenets they may say, and do say, " the meaning of that passage is not what yousuppose, nor is it to be wondered at that you should have mistaken its purport. You are aware that many passages in your Bible are falsely rendered, and this is. one of them," though it may be the fact that the unlearned believer in reality understands the passage correctly. There is yet another reason for having the present trans lation of the Bible revised, which Dr. Cumming, of all men' ought to be willing to allow. TheRoman Catholica are now making unprecedented efforts to restore their church in England; and how great is their advantage in being able to say, "You-Protestants take the Bible for your rule of faith; but how can that be a correct rule, or how can you be guided by a rule which, according to your own admission, contains numeroas -and important errors?" And I don't think Dr. Cumming will find it very easy to answer this qaestion satisfactorily. If we authorize exclusively the use of a translation which we know contains errprs, what is this but keeping the key of knowvledge to orselves ? Is this not doing the very thing with which -we charge'the Papal3Church-keeping the laityin the dark? That-there are difficulties in'the way of a revision of the authorized version is undeniable; but they are not insurmountable-and none but such as are realy insurmountable ought to hinder the Church of England from giving to a7l men who speak the English tongue the very best tranlation of the Word of God which the learning and piety of her clergy could produace. There may be hazara in under. taidng the work of revision, but there is infinitely greaterhazard in refusng it. Let the work be done in a right spirit, out of the pure and simple love of the truth, and no ono need doubt the issue. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, W. G. COOMLESEY. I A ug. 19. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent, Dr. Cumming, should confine his exibitions of himself in the chrater of a Biblical critic to Exeter-hall, or assuredly his name *ill not havebecome one of those "dear to every scholar" when the time amr ves for Mr., hiacaylaes New Zealander to take his stand on the, ruins of London-bridge. I have no desire to defend the Boman Cathouc versions of the Old and New Test ament, still less their notes; butt I should not havehbeieved the veriest tyro in theology ignorafit that they are professedly made, not from the original text) but- from. the Latin vulgate. Indeed, a jutification of this proceeding is attempted in the preface to the: Bleins Iversion. What.can the Doctor then mean by imputinga doctrinal bias to the omish translator because t'ho same Greek work is not renadred by the same phrase in theo2d and the 5th chapters of the Acts?

OAN INCUAMENT OF.THE PROVIMCE OF CANTERBuRY. August18. -
RIVER PLAT-P. - TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES. ' Sir,-Iu the interest of British comamerce with the River Plate, allow me to corrct' the mis-statements contained in a' letter sigeed "K." which appeared -in Te. Tiimas of yesterday. ,The project of law wlhich engages the attention of the Argentine Congress,' and which has'-already passed the (hamber of Depatids, does not double the import d'ties on allgoods shipped' from Biaenoi Ayres ind Montevideo. It goes still further; it establishes a complete prohibition of thoseogoods in favour of the direct trade of Europe with the new riverain ports of the Argentine Republic. 'These ports are not situated, as is stated, on a "river of intricate navigation, which can only be reaced by sihall vesels of alEght draught of water." The very reverse is the case, asis amply'proved by the facility with which vessels of war of all nations and of heavy draught of water hate navigated the River Parana as far as Paraguay-a distance. of upwards of 800 miles-in whieh river, besides, two naval engagements have taken place between tnoe combined British and French fleets and the batteries on the banlks of the river. . - lfor is the port of Buenos Ayres a safe and easily accessible harbour, as vessels are obliged to lie at a distance of six to eight-mile.s in an open roadstead, while the same vessels, however great their tonnage, can, with ease, and without risk, reach the -port of Rosario, where proximity to the shore, facilities of dischxrgin- anEd loiding, and safety are insured. If theso advantages didnob exist, it is cvident that the provin,ces must be- made to adopt a -measure viich would drive from them that trade which they now posiess.- This is the first time that a Zorth.Americani State has esÂ§Wblished prohibitions which iafourfbreigadirect'tade, and which wereformerly only resorted-to as the means iinterrupting aid checking,tho' commerce of Europe. It is trao that the effect of the present project will be to drive the greater part of the trade from Buenos Ayres -aod Montveideo to the flivial ports, but, whileit certainly wouled be injurious to the local interests of those cities, the primeial revenues of which are derived from this souree, it wonld not be dletrimental to any branch of our trade, -whichwilbe greatly favouredby the present measure, inasmuch asthe artieles of consumption introduced into the Argentine provinces, which are admitted to be three-forzths of ithe whole import trade, will be thus relieved from the payment of those additional daties and the expense now incurred at Montevideo and Baenos Ayres, which are not free ports. Whatever British diplomacy or its results may have becn as connected with the Rivar Plate, there can be no doubt that the policy now pursued bg er Majestys Government is enlightened, and 'the best adapted not only to promote the welfare of those countries, but the interests of British commerce. T The appointment of Mlr. Christie to the seat of the Central Government at Parana has followed the importanb measure adopted by General Urquiza, the President of the. Repmiblic, whereby the great river Parana was thrown open to the trade of the whole world, and although there may, at the present moment, be'few British residents, or little direet commerce to protect, there is little doubt that hisprincipal endeavonrs will be tarned to establsh that com merce on a firm basis; and his duties cannot be unimportant when it is recollected that the provinces which compose the Repablic presided over by General Urquiza consame threesfourths of the whole trade of the River Plate, the British share of which exceeds 1,00,00. sterling annually. It is perfectly trae that hitherto a complete monopoly has been maintained between Montevideo and BuenosAyres of the whole trade of the interior provinces of the Argentine Republic; but this is no reason why the monopoly should be allowed to continue to the prejudice of commeree, and it is not at Il improbable that those very mercantile establishments-which are now most clamorous against the projected measure,'and which have hitherto availed themselves of this mon^poly, vill be the first to tal-e advantage of the 4ew protecting regimen for Transatlantic commerce by sending their merchandise direct froni Europe to those iorts nearest to where they are required for provincial consumption. If it is true, as "X" declares, that three-fourths of the amierchanidise introduced into the River Plate are consumed in the interior provinces, it is evident -tat -any measure adopted for the protection;of that large proportion would be a general measure, and if thiisiipoition of the British exports to the River Plate is 'thus disposed of, and the free navigation of its tributarieswill give an impulse to the internal productions of the republic,- which- must consequently increase the impdr-sto double or treble their pre. sent amount, tha policy of the British Goveernment, as i displayed in the appointment of Mfr. Christie, naturallv represents the most general interest of British trade in the River Plate. X" asserts thatthis measurewill embarrass and damage foreign trade with `thelRivbr Plite republics, buit I caninot agree with him unless he can show that the traUsniission of goods direct and in one .bihp o-the port of consumption ; that the going to a safe, easily accessible, and convenient port, instead of a dangerous and inconvenient one, and that the savng of foreign duties and other serious charges. cAused by transshipment, are motives for producing such embarrassment or damage. - With reference to the Buenos Ayrean bondholders, they would err materially in judgment if they accepted the assertions of " X," or if they entertain the belief that their loan can be ever repaid to them unless by the assistance and cooperation of the wvhole united republic.. The time so long enjoyed byBuenos Ayres for mrintain. ing a monopoly injurious to the interests of the sister provinces has passed for ever; it cam never return unless produced by the results of civiI strife, whichsall are interetd in avoiding; and therefore eveiy exertion should be made to bring about a union founded upon free trade, thus giving one Government to theoStateinstead of two,. which can only be maintained for the benefit of a fewindividuals to the perjadice of the general commeree in thome corntries - In conclusion, it isneceasary to sUtt that this prohibition ill only lst so-long astheyrovinoe of Buenos. Ayres shall. maintain its present isolated porition sad that so soon as Buenos Ayres becomes reuniied to the remaining 13 'provinces from which it has separated itself, it will regain those advantages of which it is now deprived, and although it may never again becomr:e the set of the Cent Govern. meat, Bulenos Ares muÂ±st, ~for many obvious reasons, continae to be the centre of wealth: and the empcorium of t;rade, miore espmecially' if means are adopted for improving the;piort acnd for increasing the fac;lities of internal communicathon. - I have the honour to be, Sir, ns- nrr obedient vnt. , -: A RES&ENT OF MANY YEA.Ir IN THE I .- I'RnTVER PTATE.

A Tippea-ary paper states it is most pleasing to chronicle that 68 brave men, whio volunteeredl to fight under the banner of the gaRlant 16th Royal Irish previous to their depa*ture from Chatham for the- Crimea, rejoined the left wing of Her Majesty's 9th. Regiment on Tuesday at Butte. vant. Major Kirby opened the zanks, and as each deeorated file marched down they were enthusiastically cheered. by their old and young comrades. The men, although sunburnt and teatherbeaten, with-huge patriarchal beards and moustaches, were inuthe enjoyment of good. helth. On Monday eveuing Vice-Admniral Sir George Seymour 3LC.B., Coinmander-in.Chief at 1Portsmonth, entertained the Sardinian and Dutch captiin3 'whose frigates are at Spithead. About 4 o'clock on Saturday an addition was made to the number- of ships-of-war in Coikharboar by the arrival of the Algiers, 91, Captain Codrington, with troops from Balaldava. She had on board, the 50th and 56th lIegi. ments, to the number in all of 1,560 men, to accommodafe whom and afford stowage for baggage, stores, &c., her lower deck gunshad beenremoved. These- regiments wera the lastof the British troops that occupied the soel of the Crmea,- and it was from the possession of the 50th that the town-of Balakavawas rendered into the hands of the Russians. The men have all-a sunburntand veather. beaten appearance, and a largeproportion bear the Crimean decorations. On Sunday the troops were conveyed to Cork by the river steamers Axthur and. Alice. As soon as the disem barcation of the troops twas completed, about 5 o7lock, the Algiers got up steam again, and left the harbour. - The four despatch gunboats Mohaiwk, Lxpwing, Coquette, and Surprise, also took their departure. Their destination his not been made public. Lieutenant Boileau, B.N.,- bas arrived at his father's marine residence, BaUygihanj Kingstown. He was First Lieutenant of-Her -fajesty's ship Queen, 116 guns, Captain Stopford, which was paid off at Portsmouth on Friday.

The accounts we raceive withf respect to the resul of Austrian remoustraucea at lNaples continue to be bontradictory.'* One day we are told that Kring Ferdnnd's concessions are ouch as will satisf tim demadsof Firance and EnglanJd, enld that te question maty be considered at en en; on the next we hear that these conlcessions wre purely ilusory, and will satisfy no one. Meanwhile it is eern that General Martini has left Naples on leave of absence, which leave, it was reported two or three weeks aeo at Vienna, might end an hi: being removed from his post if he had not act up to the instructions of his Government. It is reported that Baron Hibner has been ordered to Naple3 to take up MIartini's task, and try to make the stiff-necked Sovereign of the Two Siciies liEden to reon. Mlean. while, the steps taken by Austria, end her participation in or support of thie remontrances of the WesternPowers, are tated to have greatly irritated Ferdinand, to the extent, it is said, of driving him topenl and ink. Lettersfrom Vienna speakof asort of memnoir or memorandum addre3sed to the English Govern3ment end attributed to his pen, in which the King of Raples is spoken of as te most legitimate and capable of Sovereigns, and te most consisteat in hi3policy. His consistencyis certaiy un impeachable. At the same time this document by no means spares Austria, whom it threatens with an alliance with Piedmont, for the purpose of driving her out of Italy. Such a coalition as this would inly astonish the world, and no one could ever have anticipated that Ausrian power in Italy would be menaced from that quarter. The position of Austria is undoubtedly most equivocal and awkward, and -we daily behold her seeking on certain questionathe support of Governments which she vehemently opposes on others. Thus we find her linked winth ngiand on the anestions of the Bessarabian baoundary and the lsle of Serpents, concernig which latt4r Count iBuol is said to have been perfzctly tranquilized by the entrance of the British sqzuadron into the Black Sea. On the Neapolitan question there is a wide interval between what England demands and what Austria recommends to be done; and on the question of the organization of the Danubian Principalities it is probable that she willfind herself greatly at va-ric with the viewrs of England, as she assuredly willllwitha those of France. There cannotbe a doubt that shiewill do her very utmost to prevent the union of the two provinces, in which she discerns danger to those extensiveportions of her own temitory in whose popu3ation theRoumaIic elementpredomaes. YWe know that within the last fewmonths the Alutrian officer in Moldo-Wallachia, and the numerous body of engineers employed in the trigonometrical survey of that country, have busied themselves with a sort of propagandism which we cannot but supDose had been enjoined upon them by their Government. It has been proved, and it is notorious in the PrincipalEtcs, that they lost no opp*rtunity of exciting the pessantry against their superiors, expressing surprise at the Corves they had to perform and at the imposts to which they were subject, and assuring them their brethren in Transylvania and tShe Baat were exempt from such burdens,andcwere in all respects infinitely better off. The Emperor of Austria, they were assured, was their best friend, and desirous of improving their condition. It is doubtful whether their representations obtained much7credence among the peasantry,although one or two slight disturbances that occurred in Wallachia were attributed, and in one instance traced, to the incitement of these Austrian agents. But if, byI the labours of the Commsoners and the act of theI majority of the seven Powers which have under- taken the reorganization of the Principalities, the, condition of the worldku classes is imnproved and the grievances abolished of which they now with justice complain, their position and that of the Austrian Roumana will be reversed; it will be for the latter to look with envy upon the eufranchised and flourishing population of Moldo-Wallachia, and to yearn after inclusion in the consolidated Itoumanic nationality. That Austria greedily covet3 .he possesion of the Principalitie3is no secret to any one; their union and prosperity would be aI reh barrier to the reaization, of her desires, and!I a fresh peril, although perhaps a remote one, to a portion of her present dominions. In opposing that union, in placing every obstacle in the way of their promised tranquillity ana prosperity, she does but consult her own inte , but these areunfortunately opposed to those of the Principalities, and, Ithink it wil be found, tothoseof Europe in generaL The Journa7, Franfais of Bucharest gives a detailed account. of the installation of Prince Alex-der Ghika na Kaimakan or IieutenantGovernor of Wallachia, including the text of the firman, the speech of Miamil Bey, and the reply of the Prince. Certain passages of these appear to have excited, as indeed they were calculated to do, a strong sensation among the persons present at the ceremony. In the firman Wallachia is spoken of as an. integral part of the Su7an7s empire, and as " our Imperia province," and mention is made of the privileges granted by the Porte to the Wallachians-privileges which they will hardly admit, since they consider them as rights stipulated for wYhen first the province acknowledged the protectorate of Turkey. Another unsatisfactory passage is the following: - "Until the moment of the revision of the statutes actually existing, those statutes must necessarily be conformed to in principle. Every act concerning the administration and fidure sce of the country which shall not be conformable to the existing regulations must be considered in principle 2s ron arenu." Tn his speech Kimil Bey made use of words which were listened to, says a correspondence from Bucharest, in mournful and expressive silence. They are those in italics in the following passage - " allachia is to maintai a calm and dignifed attitude, and to have fall and eitire confidence in the sentiments of exalted benevolence of Elis Imperial Majesty the Sultan, to asEte the interal administrative ameliorations which wial be discussd, approved,X and pzt into xcecution by the Sulirnze 3?crte." Prince Ghika's reply, brief and becoming, included the following sentence:- "I beg your Exceliency to believe that I will do my utmoet in order that the inhabitants of Wallachia, happy in the consolildtion of their rights and of their welfare, may uaceaingly bless tlhe: august name of His Imperial fifjesty." The words in italics, upon which the Kaimakan aid particular emphasis, wYere received with enthusiastic applause. With reference to the fi-man and to the speech of Kiamil Pey, the correspondence already referred to has the follomng remarks :- "Arwein thesame situastion relatively to thePorte as the Bulgarians and its other subjects properly so called? Havo 'we, yes or no, our righte, and may we now reckon zerionsly on the position that- they create for us in our relatiozs with Taurkey? Then, why wish to encroach on what our treaties-. with her secure e" The corespondent adds that there is much talk of the approachina return of the Wallachian political emigrants to their country, and that Prince Ghika i3 said earnestly to desire - it. To the fulfilment of thia desire -I think there can now be scarcely an obstacle. The Wallachiau emigrants aro not numerous. I doubt if they amount to 40 persons, but among these are some of the most intelligent and able men of that Principality, whose presence there would certainly be desirable during the aproaching investigation;, and if among these exles there are a fe men (I believe very few) whom e-. aggerated doctrines and Socialist theories have nmisled,, it is to be hoped and expected that these will eacrce their opiions, at least temporarly, to those of the great majority, 'or at any rate not ijudiciously put them forward at a time when a calm andmoderate attitude is incumbentupon every Tvlodo-Wallachiau who sincerely desires the welfare of his countzy. This, they may be well assured, will not be attained by exorbitant demands, or by political dissensions a -ong them slves. " The idea of the union of the Principalities," says tie lettsr quoted, - Ls dominant in everr one's mind: it is the sole thought, it is tl?e generaDl Wish, of ths Mfoldo-Maiachians. Even the frisds of Er=a join the mass of tho nation in stivino for tho union, and, whatever the maotive that inspires Rus;i5 with'thess tasticn, it is cerEain that she sapport.s the union at,Bacharest. and at Jassy, aS she did tat the Congress of Paris. It was. rcmarked that the Consuls of Prwusia and Ansuia were not present at the reading of the firman." ' Count Walewki, Minister of Foreign Affaird, gave a-gran4 lmenron Fridjy in honour of the f6to of the Empero. -There were preaent the PapelNuncio, theo Englimh and Turidgh -i;nb&=&doj, -ad al1- the diplomatic body; Viseouht de -ruar, Envoy straordiuary efrom the 3mperor of the -}rails; Colonel Careniont, m ijtl commisier of- the British Government it - ri -the Miniters; Count Portalis Gn=eral C,ier, Baron de Butean: val; 3f.

Monsignor Sacconi, tie Papa4 Nuncis, inthe namne of the diplomatic body, proposedthe health of the Emperor, to which Count Waewaki repliedby a tat to the Sovereigns and Governments allies and friends of France.: On the occasion of the national f6te of the 15th the Minister of Statehas ordered-the distribution of 1,300,00Qf. from? the funds ppropriateeC for -the execution of the wil of the Emperor Napoleon 1. among the 26 departments designated by the august testator. The amount for each wilU be 50,OOOf. 'She Mnisterhas also laced at the disposal of the Grand Chanucelor of tlb Legion of Honour a part -of the funds of the will intendeifor old soldiers, and which. is to be distributed among four or five thousand of the oldest and most neceitoms. The Emperor, the Empress, and the Pxince Imperl are to leave to-Iorrow for Biarritz. A letter from Constatinople, in the Gazefte du Midi, after giving an account of a distribution of prizes made to the pupils of the Chrisan schools in that capital, says:- " T the capital of Ilamism, at 1,000 leagues from lar Eeliles, such a picture is mnoze striing tiha elsewhere, and we cnnot but thank Providence for the advntagespro. cured to civilization and to Christianity by the Society fori the Propagation of the Faith. It is this society which alone has supported Zor the lad 16 years the three schools at Constantinople, which now reckon 700 ptmpil>, and might be readily doubled it suitablo accommodation could bW procured. The bhols given in-prizes to the pupils were duo to the French Ambassador and MLonsignor Mussabini, Archbihop of Smyrna.- The distribution took place on the 22d in the garden of the Embasy; the cemmony was presided over by the Archbishop of Smyrna; Monsignors Hassoum. Amneno-Catiolc Bishop; Triocie, Archbishop of Babylon Salvya2n, Bishop of Erseroum; Hating; Bshop in pVamibw, and Ihe Armeno-Catholic Patriarch.; There were also present Count de Sdgur, first Sec rey-of, the French Embassy; General Parisset; and a niumber of priests of the parishes and Catholic chapoels of Constntinople. A French military band was in attendance. The different works of the pupils, copybooks, drawingn &e., were suspended to the trees, and somo of the children recited interesting dialogues vith much grace tad facility. The majestic appearance of thoepontiffi with their'loig white beard the variety of costumes, the delight expressedby the pupils, and the enlivening airs of the music, alto-' gether made theRte a most attractive one." Ns'o improvement has taken place in the commercial situation of Paris. The dearness of provisionsand lodgings and the increase in the price of goods generally have produced a diminution in the cousumption, and consequently in the activity of transactions. Manufacturers, however, suffer little from this state of stagnation. During the last two months they have sold largely for South Araerica, but particularly for Brazil. The trade of France 'With that country is daily extending. Jewelry has been in considerable demand. in Russia, on account of the coronation of the Emperor, and the quantity supplied by Paris amounts to between 2,000,000f. and 3,000,000. Most ofthe furniture, silks, bronze rdticles, and fancy goods required for the fetes of the coronation have- been likewise furnished by France to the amount of up, wards of 10,000,000f. The price of graincontinues to decline all over the country. On Saturday it was scarcely possible to sell old wheat, that of the new crop being found so superior in every respecT. M1any farmers, - who little - expected such a result, and believed that the harvest would benlate one, and had accordingly kept back their wheat of last year, are now obliged to submit to sacrifices and pat with their produce at a serious los3. The fall during the week has been between 38. and 4f. per hectolitre aud a half, or 7f. in the fortnight. Flour however maintained its price, because of thedrought, which pzevents many mills from working. The flour offered for sale stUll fetchea 94f. per sack of 157 kilogramimes, but for the four months from September the quotation is only 83f., and for the first four months of 1857 it is under Sf. The Echo Agricole thus describes the result of the harvest in the north :- - " In the departments north of the Loire a finer season for saving the harvest has not been known for years. Wheat was never drier. In aI the moEt productive departments of France the sheaves are extremely abundant, and, although the ears do nob yield so much as was expected, the quantity of sheaves insares a large produce per hectare. Thus, in all the region of France extending from the banks of the Loire to the Belgian frontier, itis calculated that the average number of sheaves per hectarn exceeds that of 1855 by 150 to 200. The yield of each sheaf being at least equal to that of last year, the quantity of wheat reaped in 156 wil consequently be superior by three or four hectolitres per hectare to that of 1855. In the north this augmentation in the produce may bo fairly calculated at from 8,000,Q00 to 10,000,000 of hectolitresY" The l-cho infers from thesE facts that the position is widely different from what it was at the same period last year, and anticipates shortly a considerable decline in Drices. The sale of cattle was difficult at the last markets of Sceaux,Poissy, and La Chapelle. The owners, however, preferred tlaing away their cattle to lowering their pretenons. The price of wine has somewhat declined in the south sinCe it has been ascertained that the injuy done by the oidiuma w .S exaggerated. It was not believed, however, that the fall woiud maake much progress, as the crop will searcely come up to one-fourth of an ordinary year in that part4 of t.he counr. Brandy ISstl risincowing to the scarcity of the article. It sells at Paclz for 2101., and for 200f. at Bordeaux. The price of snirits extracted from beet is 1 52f. at Paris;and 1601. at Bordeaux.

In St. Petersburg there is a story in circulation' of a re_ly that Sir Charles Napier gave the Grand Duke Constantine.

The ordinlance for the sale of corn, oats, and pearl barley fixes the price at 10 per cent, l!ower than thevare tobe had intheordinnryeoe of trade. A considerable number of labourers in OstPreussen have been engaged bythe Russian Govern ment for the term of three years, who are to be employed in the rebuilding of the south side of SebastopoL The wages offered are a thaler or 3s. a day, to commence from the day of departure from home and to continue to the day of return thither: those who are marTied are to be permitte to visit their families once a-year. If more fugitive Poles have not yet returned to their native land than we hear of having done so, it has not been for want of numerous applications forl permission to return. A gentleman just returned from Warsaw. states that there are quantities of applications now lying unanswered in%the. Government offices in that town, that the indolence of the Russin empoies is something totaly above the imagination of those who have not ha amwpe personal experience: of it. The Russian Embasies in foreign cities are unremitting in their inquiries if there is no answer yet to the applications they have forwarded, and the upper authoritiesf in the 'Government are, as mnay be supposed, no.t baclkward in reproofs and threats;hut Russian indolence is rep?resentedasbeing proof against every spur to activity, except perhaps fair pay for their work. f SCANDINAVIA. A letter from Stockholm of t-he 7th inst., in the Debats, says "It has been already mentioned that a scientific expedi. tion, under Admiral Glasenap, of the Russian navy, accompanied by six engineers and officers, is at present exploring the northerr. coasts of Norway. I will now call your attention to the Gulf of Bothnia, which, from its situation, is the most favourable point for tbo landing of an enemy's army, should there be an idea at any future time of malcing the oonquest of our capitaL Tne Swedish Government has been informed that the Russian General of Engineers De. Berg, bwho was Governor-General of Finland during the late war, has several times this sammer visited the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia opposite the norhern coast of Finland. The attention of this officer was particularly directed to the smaU Island of Kasko, situated tX the north of the islands of and. This islana, which is composed of a single block of rock, has the finest possible port formed by the hand ofnature. It is so deep that ships of the line can approach close to the shore. There is a small town on the island, of about 1,000 to 1,200 inhabitants. The port of Easko also. presents this great advantage over all the others on the coast, that it is surrounded by small clusters of rocks, which break the sea, and thus render the port more secure for. merchant and other vessels. By means of a flying bridge 250 feet in length Kasko has a communication with the coast of Finland. Thisharbour remains open to navigation for ai-onth or sx weeks later in the season than any of the otherports, andsailing vesselscanleave it with the windfrom. any quarter so long as the sea remains open. It masy be readilyconceived what importancothe RUssian Government attaches to this port, and no doubt is felt hero of its intention to convert it into a second Sweaborg, and there form a third naval establishment for its Baltic Beet. This noew ,fortes woOuld be always dangerous for the capital. of Sweden, as nothing would be more eay than in a few hours to throw a larga body of troops from Hasko on the Swedish. coat of the Gulf of Finland, and march thaem on Stock., hoh,while a fleet fromthe Gulf might attack it at the sametime by se.M Takenthusbetween two fires, the city could nat-long resist the combined efforts of the Russians, should they think proper, undr.certain poEtical aventn alities, to declare war against Sweden." i SPA I.

As the indivisibility of the four principles ,and the limitatioio pon the' sovereign attribute of negotiating with' otheiPoweris are not a part of the 'Declaration,' any nation is at liberty to reiect either or both, and to act upon the ' Declartioni' without restriction, acceding to it in whole orinpart In deliberating on this importantsubJect, it behoves all Powers to consider, and, if they thinLk tproper,tet uponthisd4tinction.

"mhe second s;na t hird principl-s set forth in the 'I>eclaratio,' beingthese submitted to other maitime Powers for ta.doptionby this Goveernment, it is mos ani3ous to see incorporated by general consent, into the code of maritime lAw, and thus placed beyoind future controversy or question. ,uch a result, securing so may advantages to the co4mmerce ofnzeutral aions night have been reasonably expectea but for the proceeings of the Congress at Paris, which require 'them to be purchised by a too costly sacrifice-the surrender of a rig,ht which, may ell be considered as essential to -hb Ifreedom of the seas. "The fourth principle contained in the 'Declation,' amely-' BlockIdes; in order to be binding, must ba effetive; that is to say, agntained by a force suffident reali to prevent access to the coast of the enemy-eatn hardly be regarded as ohe falling withinthat cl asswith wshich 't was the object of the Congress-to interfere; for this rule 'has not, for a long time, been regarded as uncertain, or the caxuse o,f aiy'deplorable disputes.' 'If there have been anuy :disput in regard to.bwloclades, the uncertainty was about the facts6,but not thea. Those nations which have resorted 'to what are appropriately denominated 'paper hloike.des' haie 4 rarely, if ever, undertaken afterwards to ustify their .con t upon principle; but have generally admitted the illegality of the practice, and indem nifid the injuwre parties. "What is to be sdjudged ' a force sufficient really to prevent access to A' coast of 'the enemjy' has often o'ben a severelyTconteste' qustioni ar;d certainly 'the 'dvartion- which, merely reiterates a general undisputed 'maxim of mcratime law r does no'thing towards relieving thae subject of bloclade from that embarrassment.

'"in reg-srdto theright to employ privsteers, which is d6clarea to be abolished by the firs, principle put forth in 'tho Declaration,' there was, if possible, less uncertainty. Therightto resorttoprivsteersis asdeslras the right to use public armed ships, and as incontestible as any other right appertaining to belligerents. The policy of that law his been occasionally questioued,, not, however, by the best Luthorities; but the Jaw itself has been universaRly admitted, and most nations have not hesitated to avail themselves of it; it is as well sustained by practice and public I olinion as anyother to be found in the maritime code. .There is scarcely: any.rule of international law which ipaticular nations in their treaties have not occasionaly suspended or modified in regard ,to its application to themselves. Two treaties only can be found in which the contracting parties have azreed to abstain frm. the employment of privateers in caso of war between them. The first was a tseaty between- 'the 'Ring of Sweden and the StatesGeneral of the United Provinces, in 1675. Shortly after it was eonclu4e. the pa,ried were involved in war, and the ,stipulation concerning privateers was entirely disregarded ' bybeoh.

"The nersigned is directed by the Pxesiaent'eoa`y that to this principle of exempting private propery uipon the ocean, as well aS upon the land, applied without reic-- -ion, he yields a most redy andilling assent. The under signed cannot bettr express the PresidenVs viens upon $ 3abiect than by quoting the language of his annual message: to Congress, of December 4, 155I:- "'The proposition to' enter into angagements to forego a resort to privateers, in case this zountry should be forbedinto a war -with a greet nlav Power is not entitled to more favourable consideration than woud be a propositio- to: agree not to accept the services of volunteers for opeatiots, on lnd. When the honour or nights of ourcopuntyrequiR4it to assume a hostile attitude, it confidently relies upon thei patriotism of its citizens, not ordinarily devoted to thes' military profession, to augment the amy and navy, sol* to male thema fully adequate to the emergency which calls: tbem into action. The proposl to surrender the right to enmploy volunteers is professidly founded upon th prii: ciple that private property of unoffending non-comnbatants. thounh enemes, shouldbe exempt from thezavages of-war;: b-t tte proposed surrender goes but Litle way in carmiyi -out that prnciple, which equally requires that such ptrirteproperty should not be seized or molested by national ships. of war. Should the leading Powers of Europe concur-rn proposing, asa rule of interational law, to exempt private property, upon the ocean, from seizure by public arod! cruisers as well as by privateer, the hinite4 States readily meet them npon that broad ground.' "The reasons in favour of the doctrino that private prO perty ahould be exempted from seizure in the operations of; war are-considere& in this enlightened age so controllingal; -to have secured its partial adoption by all civilzed nxtions-;, but it vouldbe, difficult to find any substantial -easons for the distinction nowrecognized in its application to such pro-~ peaty on land, ana not to that which is found upon the oceON. "If it be the object of the declaration adopted at Paris to' abolish this distinction, and to give the same security from the ravages of war to the property of belligerent subjects on tthe ocean as is now acoordea to such property upon the land, the Congress at-Paris hs Men short of the proposed result by not placing individual effects of belligerentsbeyond the reach of public. armea ships ssWe aas privateersX If such property is to remain exposed to seIzure by. ships, 'blonging to the navy of the adverse part, it is etrem6lj difficult to perceive why it ohould nt, in like mannier, be exposed to seizure -byprivateers, which are, in fact, but another bianch of the public force of the nation commisioningthem. - "If the principle of cpturing private property on-the' ocean, sad condemning it as prize of var, be given up, that property would, and. of right ought to be, as secure from molestation'Dy public ameda essels as by privateers; bit if that principle be adhered to, it would be worse than uselessto attempt to confine the exercise of the right of cap. ture to any particular description of the public force of the belligerents. Thereis no sound principle by which such a distinction oan be sutained; no capacity which could trace ,a definite line 'of sepmation proposed to be made; and no - roper tribbinal to which a disputed question on that subject could be referred for adjustment. The pretenco that the distinction may be supported uponthe ground that ships not belonging permanently to aregular navy are more likely to disregard the rights of neutrals than those-which do belong to such a TuVy iS not well sustained by modem expest.. ence. If itbe urged that a participation inthe przes is cAlculated to stimulate cupidity, that, as a peculiar objection, is removed by the fact that the same passion is awlakened by the distribittios of prize-money among the officers and crews of ships of a regularnuavy. Every nation v'hich authorizes privateersis as responsible for their conduct as it is for that of its navy, anid ill, as a maxtter of prudence, take proper iprecaution anad curity aganst abuses. "But if such a distminon were to be attempted, it woulo1 bO 'very difficult, if not impracticable, to define the paticUlar class of theo publio maritime force which should ba -regarded is privateers. 'Deplorable disput,' more in inumber, and more difficult of adjustinent, would arise from tan attempt to discrimiaot between privateers and pvbiidi atmedshipms. - - - "If such a iscrismition were attempted, every nation, vwoui have an undoubted right to declare what se-, should cbnstitute its navy, and what should be requisite'to; 1give them the character of public armed ships. These ate. matters which could not be safely or prudently left to the detennination or supervision of any foreign Power,,yet the Idecision,oÂ£ such controversies would naturally faMl into the hands of predomoinant naval Power, -which would have the Tability to tuforce their udgments. It cannot be offensive ,tÂ° ulrge weaker Powers to avoid, as far as possible, such an arbitrament, and tio maintain with firmness every existing barrier against encroachments from such a quarter. "s Io nation swhich has a due sense of self-respect will allow any other, belligerent or neutal, to detemiine the chracter of the foroe wbich it may deem proper to use in proeting hotilities; nof will it act wisely if it vomuntarily. surendss fthe right to resort to any means snctioned by - internationa law, which, under any cir- cuinstances, -may- be advastagus!y used- for defence oragreson. e "The'united States considerpo0werful navies and- lar standing armies, as.

The following communication relates to the progress of the vine disease in Portugal3 and announces that the Alto-Douro district, which in 184S produced 111,000pipes of wine, will this year not produce 4,000. The distress of the population from this cause, together with an unfavourable harvest, is understood to-be excessive- "Sir,-The vinermalady, which undersucgro Aug. 9. various phases has for some years past caused so much destruction m'te vineyards of Europe, having again appeared in Portuga the subject caunot fail to he interesting to the readers of e imes, and therefoor I do not hesitate to submit toyeou a few practical o'oservations of my own, made during my' tour' last month in the portwrine districts of the Alto-Douro and iun'he country between those districts and the Spaluish frontier. "1L The o7diure appeared this year in the Alto-lDouse about the end of May, or early in June, and blighted the budding fzllit. "1 2. In the beginning of July the disease increased in intensity; the very limited quantity of fruit (formed and grown to the size of small shot) was suddenly covered with the fungus, and one-half of the grapes were converted, as it were, into stones, while the other half burst. " 3. For about four days the vines were paralyzed. The branches drooped, and fears were entertained for the future fite of the parent stem, when suddenly vegetation recommenced with fresh viour- the branches' increased in'size and ztrength, and the reaves were more verdant than ever, tho plant throwing out new and healthy rcots, an being apparently unaffected by the parasitic destruction of its rut. "4. By the end of July another visible change tooklace in the vines of tho Alto-Douro; thelewgrapes which lad - escaped, but which had become quite hard began to incremse in size, and to be Teas affected by t:he oYdium, then a, severe thunderstorm swept away at least two-thirds bf the remaining fruit, and the ligneous part of the branches, and even the tendrils, became stained with a variety of leopardlike spots of various hues, while the healthy colour of the leaves remained unchanged. - "' 5. Many proprietors of vineyards, finding that their crops of trapes are already destroyed, hawve determined no loner to cultivate their es4ttes. - "6. If the cultivation of a vineyard in Portugal be neglected for three successive yers -the vines will cease to produce, and a new plantation, or grafting of vines, be rendered absolutely necessary. 7,. The restrictions m tlie'*ine, districts of the AltoDouro stll cause the most prejudicial effects on the agricultura and cormercial interests of Portugal, 'as those restrictions indirectly prohibit every improvement not only ir. the cultivation of the vine, but likewise in the msste of malking tho wines intended for exportation. - 3 S.

Ie sys:-"A more scandalous, unsatisfactory, and ispudunt statement never appeared in print than that 'which came out in your Tuesday's impression. It appears to me, and to hundreds more in this town, that Dove's villanous habit of lyinz followed him even, to his prison, andto th scaffold. I tell you, gentlemen, and can give you ample ureef of the trth of my assertion, that not one-tenith p ar of Dove's statement in lns prison is true. I have uniform!, wished himz to behave well to his wife, and to go home and use kind, conciliating Languge to her, and 'she woud then meet him wvith a smile.' And he admits that. The statement made by Dove in June should have been in the hearing of Hardcastle, who declares that all he (Dove) says is a tissue of lies that can be very soon refuted." He then observes thpt he htas beem the eins of iltming many from a sick bed, and that if the conductors of newspapers knew balf as much about him as they ought to do, they would not have treated him in the manner they had done. Avter which he continues:-"I always tog Dove that he never would be happy with his' wifeuntil sheshould bring him some children,- and that it would be much botter that he should separate from her if he could not live, agreeable -with her; thAt it.was no credit to him to be continually tormenting I -woman who could not yield him thoee blessings which nature forbade her -to give, vi, - a half-2ozen children, which he ( aove) pretended to long for; Gentlemen, it will be of no use me attempting. to deny ang one paricular statement made by tlhat profllgate ana nfeelingcrÂ¢nnunal, as Idelre to ou, -upon my honour, that there is scarcely a sentence of ittrue; and a'atis -true is told ix such a raving, incoherent manner, that the pubec-aye, the public-have -seen the folly of publishing at,. and that same discering apublic declre- 'that the document ought not to - have been. put into print."'

TaH FLODS Or THE AIflUITy. ThLe morning paper-give the following accounts of yesterda's proceedings in, Dublin and Kingstown :-. "Yesterday, at 12 clocek, Sir Charles Wood lnd Ad. miral Berkeley Lords of the Admiralty, visited the new xgraving-dock which is being constructed at the XToctls-walU. Ti'heir oord hips arcived in one of the Vieeregal carriages, and wrea accompanied by Colonel Larcom, Under-Secretary. Their Lordships mincutly examined the plens of the dock, which were explained to them by Mr. Hpin, chief engineer, and by lJr. Stoney, assistant engineer. They also nscected the works closely, and made vaeous inquiries on thi subject, and, after havng spent a considerable time in their examinations, expressed themselves highly pleased vith the admi-able manner in which those splendid works are being executed. " Shortly after 3 o'clock his Excellency the Lord-Lientenant quitted Westland-row terminus by special train for the purpose of going on board the Admiralty yacht Osborne, late the Victoria and Albert, and the mrortar frigate Forth, an present acting as tender to the yacht, for the Purpose of being presentt, should circumstances permit, at the grunboat shell practi-e, which was to have taken place outside the mouth of the harbour. It appeared, however, that, owing to a strong sea and a headwind, the gunboats had ;not secceded in making Kingstown, and the weather was also too rough for the Forth to display the capabilities of the celebrated 13-inch mortars, which could not be fired in haTbour without the risk of shattering every pane of glass inttthe town. The Viceregal visit, therefore, confaned itself to a mere round of inspection, with a short sail as faras theMu-glins, the probable objectof which was to look after the missing vessels. His ExceUency was accompanied by Lady Dover, Sir Charles Wood, Lady sry Wood and Miss wood, lord Cowper and the Hon. ir. Cowper, Mr. F. Howard, Hon. Colonel 1ensonby, Captain Evererd, Captain Willis, Captain'Williams, and Captair ]Butler, aide-de-camp, and the Viceregal party were con* veyed on board the yacht in two barges manned b3 artions of the crew of the Osborne; that in whici /s Excelency was conveyed being steered by Cap tain Bowers, Lieutenant-Commander, R.N. As hn Excellency mounted the side of the Osborne a salute of 21 guns was fired fiom some of the smaller guns of the attendant vessel with magnificent effect, and, having spent a considerable time in examiningthe internal arrangements of the noble yacht, his Excellencywasthenput onboard the Forth, mortar frigate, Lord John Ray commander, where he was reoeived with all formalities, the yards manned, -&c. The Forth was an old 44-gun frigate cut down and fitted up as a mortar-vessel with a very heavy armament, comprising, in addition to 10 or 12 ordinary guns, two68-pounders and two 13-inch mortars. Having been conducted over her decks, -&c., his Excellency next went on board the beautiful yacht, lint a few hours arrived, the property of Sir Alexander Bannerinan, on quitting which his Excelency than returned to the Osborne, 'which immediately slipped her anchor nnd stood out to sea, where she underwent rather a sevare tossing. The trip lasted about an hour and 10 miinutes, and on the return of the vessel his Excellency and suite entered the special train, which was in waitieg at the terminus, and -were conveyed to town in the marveDously short period of se-wn and a-half minutes. His Excellency was attended by Mr. WaDler, one of the directors, and Yr. Muggeridge, the secretary of the cornmany, and was received upon the jetty by Lieutenant -utrhi3on, .N., harbour-master." ,mNDIAs er-van asyviec. The laurels won by the Dublin IJniversity at the last competitive examination have been added to by the appointment of two more gentlemen, graduates of Trinity College, to lucrative appointments in the civil service of the East India Company. In the course of last week the Court of Directors selected for imnedate employment in the Educational Department in India, with eligibility to the important office of Principal when openings occur, Mr. R. L. Talartin, A.B., son of the Archdeacon of Ardagh, and Nr. H. Smith, A.B., son of a beneficed clergyman in the north of Ireland. The grounds of selection in both caseswere the numerousandhigh distinctions obtained by these young men during their undergraduate course and at their degree examination. rim WEATa:R. A marked and, even for this fickle climate, singular change in the weather has taken place since Saturday last. In the afternoon of that day the wind set in at north-east, and it suddenly became sharp and cold.' Sunday, though a fine and bright day, the temperature fell lower; and yesterday, in the absence of all sunshine, the glass sunk to 50, being nearly 30 deg,rees below what it stood at only eight or 10 days previously. In fact, during any part of the day no one would have been surprised at the apparition oi a snow shower in the middle of the month of August. The change from tropical heat to a intense cold has been general in Ireland-all the last weather reports announcing the veering of the windfoa north-easterly point,with n11 the symptoms 6f a premature winter. This morning opened dark and gloomy, but the cold has somewhat abated.

&TMMER AMI -.: -- WORTHERN. CtRCUIT. TlVERPOOL, Auq.19.- ? --' (4lV CdURT. -(Befo6n ,Ms. JTstice VjliEs.) 'Yesterday afteMroon James Bracken, i'nourer, aged 24, snd Andrew Bracken, labourer, aged Z., Mns brother, were indicted fortho wilful murder of hDE aUm Bates, at Manchester, on the -28th-of June .ast r. igain appeared for file prosecution, and AMr. T. Atkinson and Mx. M'DomuI1 severally defended the prisonerrs Itappeasedfiom t!e statement of the learned coumsel forl the prosecution, .ad-from the evidence ior the prosecution, that on the night of the 28th oh Jusne a person namedTayior and the deceased were coming down George-street, Hulme, aboat 9 o'clock in the evening, and, having spent the day together in publichouses, they were not quite sober. In George-street is a be-rhouse called the Brown Cow, and when they got to that place they saw the two. prisoners |fghting a man, whom they chased into a beerhouse. Immediately Taylor and-Bates got near to.where the fight Lad taken place one of the prisoners made. a blow at Taylor, who went away for a policeman, leaving the deceased there, and when he came back Bates had beenmxeoved. - Both the prisoners struck tho decessed, who was knocked down more than once, andwhile down theprim-ner Andrew came tip and Lickedhim onthe headsevera-alties. Hoewas fouldinthostreet in an insensible state and takeia to-the infirmary, where lo was attended by a surgeon, who found himbnrised in several places; there was avery extensive fracture of the skul, and the cause of Batess death was 'an etision, of blood - on the brain. Having had his wounds dressed he was reraoved to the police station next door, but he died during the course of that evening, and was insensible from the time of his receiving the kicks on the head until the time of his death. Both the prisoner3, it appeared, had been drinking from noon till 9 o'clock at night. As the deceased and Taylor approached the beerhouse, where the prisoners were fighting with a man, one of the prisoners was heard to cry out-" Here are two brothexs, who will face us m3en?'- After the deceased had been struck * and knocked down, the prisoner, -Andrew Bracken, knocked him down again on the flags, and Iicked bim on his heai more than once - witness, namdA Mrs. Ann Smith, who was pasing down the street, raised the deceased up, but he was knocked down again and kicked in the middle of his back and on the top of his head. Mrs. Smith ehonted " Murder !" and told the prisoner, Andrew Bracken, that he vould ill the man. Andrewv replied, ' We'll kill the - " and again kicked him. The afray lasted abont a quarter of an hour, and there had been a ring formed, in which the parties were fighting. Jamnes Bracken was seen to strike the deceased a heavy blow on the bridge of his nose, which knocked him down, and Andrew then said he would break his head and let his brains out, after saying which he ran up to Bates, who was lying on the flags, and kicked him several times on the head. The people round abontcalled out "Murder, murder ! The man is killed, the man is killed " The deceased was then taken insensible to the police station, where he died. Abouttwohours afterwards iMlr. Foster, house-surgeon to the Salford Dispensary, made apost msortent examination of the deceased, and foumd the skull fractured and a considerable effusioni of blood on the brain, which had caused death. For the defence of the prisoners their respective counsel coutended that the row was a drunken brawl and a fight, in the course of which the deceased had received the injuries and that at most the killing of tho deceased was not murder, but manslaughter. - His LORDsHIP then proceeded to sum up, observing that drunkenness was no excuse or palliation for crime. That which was done by a drunken man was as much murder as that act could be by a sober man. If any body intentionally did an act which he meant to cause death, and It dlid cause death, that was murder. Further, the law applicable to this case was, that if anybody did intentionally that, the probable and natural-result of which wvas to case death, he was guilty of murder. If a man were to call on the prisoner to prove the intention which existed in his mind, the answer would be that the act he had done, being one naturally tending to death, involved intention, and was murder. But the law, making allowances for the infirmities to which human nature was saubjected, provided for them by making a distinction, constituting one degree of crime murder, and another, witl extenuating circumstances, manslaughter_ Thus, if two men fought, while quarrelling, and one of them killed the other, it would be manslaughter;- but, if they fought with deadly weapons, it wrould be murder. There was, according to the evidence, a great difference between the cases of the two prisoners; and probably the jury might think that, while James was guilty of manslaughter, Andrew was guilty of the murder, if he knew when he was striking the man that the injuries he was inflicting were likely to cause death. His Lordship then proceeded to read over and comment upon the evidence. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 25 mninutes to .7, and at 25 minutes to 8 they returned into court, when a deathlike stillness prevailed. The Clerk of the Crown then asked the foreman if the iury had agreed upon their verdict ? The Foreman.-We have. We find James Bracken Guilty of manslaughter; and Andrew Bracken we find Guilty of wilful murder, but with a strong recommendafion to mercy. The scene that now ensued can scarcely be described. A kind of groan, as it were of pity, was raised in the densely crowded court, while three women in the gallery, at the back of the court, shrieked in a dreadful manner, and one of them was seized with a fainting fit. Th2ey were all taken outside the court, and it was slated that they were the aged mother of the prisOners and their two sisters. The prisoner Jam es fell back into the dock and fainted, but in two minutes again revived, when, kneeling at the bar, he raised his hands to heaven, and, with a piteous look at the judge, cried, "Oh, myBLord, have mercy on my brother." The prisoner Andrew literally tore his hair, and, rt kneeling and then standin, piteously cried, "Oh, Ily Lord, I beg mercy." lis Lordship sobbed audibly, and appeared to be quite overpowered by the scene. y ainng put on the black c.ap, His IoBDSf then proceeded to pass sentence on the apriSOners. He said,-Andrew Bracken, prisoner at the bar, you have been con icted of the crime of wilful murder, and you, JamkesBracken, of the crime of manslaughter. A peaceable subject of Her MEajesty, passing along the streets iof the city of MIanchester, is brutally attacked by you both. IYou were, no doubt, engaged in a common designu of attacking any person who came along that way, and of beating him in a cruel and violent manner. You, James Bracken, have been convicted of m.anslaughter, and you, too, were engaged in the unlawvful design which I have described, but you were no party to the last violent and cruel attack by which that unhappy man was sent to an untimely grave. You, Andrew Bracken, were guilty of that; you attacked him with your feet, armed, no doubt, with clogs; you kicked him about the head; you fractured his skull, and you sent him to a premature grave. You did an act, the natural and ordinary consequences Of which must have been to kill the man. It was a cruel and a brutal act, and you did it wholly reckless of the consequences which it might produce. You have, therefore, been very properly convicted of the wilful murder of that man. The jury, however, have accompanied their verdict by a recommendation to mercy; I presume that was on account of the drunken state in which you were. That, in point of law, is no palliation of your crime. I have it not in my power, Andrew Bracken, to attend to that recommendation. The pierogative of mercy rests with Her Majesty alone, and I cannot encourage you in any hope whatever that that recommendation will be acted upon I shil, however, forward it to the Secretary of State, to be laid before Her Majesty, that you may be placed at her mercy. Again I say, thatI cannot hold out to you any hope that that recommendation will be concurred in ; but I now most earnestly recommend you, with the assistance of your clergyman, to seek that mercy from the Almighty which -you liad not for William Bates., With regard to you, James Bracken, you were guilty pf manslaughter of the most aggravated character, and for that offence the sentence of the Court ia that you be transported for life. Upon you, Andrew Bracken, the sentence of the Court is, that you be removed hence to the place from whence you came, and thence to a place of public execution, and that there you be hanged by the naec7n until your body be dead, and that it be then buried within the precincta of the gaol in which you shall have been last confned; and may God, in the plenitude of His goodness, have mercy upon your soul. The prisoner Andrew fell down again in the dock and begged for mercy; but being raised by the turnkey, was escortedfrom the dock, ejaculating, with fearful intensity, of earnestness, "Oh, mother, mother, -that I should be hung.". For a few minutes the court seemed paralyzed by ithe shocking scene which it had witnessed; and his Lordship havine raised his head from his hands, slowvly rose and leit the court amid solemn silence. Several women were carried out fainting,, and, it was rumoured about that the prisoner James Bracken, if acquitted, was engaged to be married nest morning The Court adjourned at 8 o'clock. To-day the Court has been occupied all day with the trial of a woman named Jane Newton, charged with having onL tha 4th of May last attempted to poison' her husband with arsenic, at Aehton-under-Line.

| CVBNTBAL CRMINAzL COURB2 Avg. 19. - OLD COURT. (Beforc tthe Commoass SERJrrT.) Daniei Yusuf Ben Houlin, an Arab, surrendered to talke his trial for misdemeanour, in having -published certain false and defamatory libels upon Arthur de Guise. Mr. Ribton -was counsel for the prosecation ; Mr. Robin' son appeared for the defendant. Mr. ROmBiSoN said that in this case the parties had come to an arrangement that would save the Court and jury the trouble of going into the details. The prosecutorwas a highly respectable gentleman, a foreigner, and* he and the defendant had been on most intimate 'terms. In consequence, however, of some pecuniary trausactiousthat took place between them there had been iUl fedings created, and the defendant had written some letters that reflected upon the chaWacter of the prosecutor and his v'ife, and it 'was for publishing these letters that the present indictment had been preferred. He was novw, however, instructed to'state that the defendant was satisfied that there was no foundation for the statements contained in tho letters in question; and that he retracted all the offensive matters contained in them in the fuUest possible manner, and at the same time expressed his regret that he had published the charges compinuned of. Mr. RInTOw said that the prosecutor, Yi. de Guise, be. longed to one of. the oldest and most noble families in France. He had served with honour in the Hungarian iiisurrection, and was now engaged as a merchant in the city of London. He had no other object than to vindicate his character, and, asthe defendant had unreservedly withdrawn the imputations that were sought to be cast upon the prosecutor, had admitted hehre was no foundation for them, and bad apologized for the cours hlie had taken, the prosecutor bad no desire to proceed further with the matter, and he should thberefore withdraw from the prosecutlen.- The C03roso SERJEANT expressed his opinion that by the retractation and apology that had been made the honour of the prosecutor wo ld be much better satisfied than if there had been a trial and conviction. The defendant then entered into his personal recognizance to appear on any future occasion, if be should be required to do so. James Railton, 40, a respectable-looking man, pleaded "Guilty" to two indictments charging hiim with forging a transfer of Consol stock to the amount of 7001., and also with forging a receipt. MEr. COOPER, who appeared for the prisoner, stated that he was 'formerly a stockbroker, and he had the power of transferring certain stock, and it appeared that he had done so and applied the proceeds to his own use in some inst.-nces, and in others he had induced persons to personate the partiesto whom the stock belonged. He had made good the amounts of stock he so obtained as longas he could, but at leiigth he became inextricably involved, and the present prosecutions were the result. The Co3rio2 SETJBEANT inquired the amount of the prisoner's defalcatMons, and he was informed that stock to the amount of 2,0001. had-'been altogether transf6s-red by forged transf.ers, hut the prisoner had rejilaced stock to the amnount of 1,10012, so that there were 9OO0L only deficient. The Cos.msox Sxssssaxv postponed passing sentence. James Reilly, 30, was indicted for assaulting William Joslevine with intent to rob him. The prosecutor stated that he was a butler, end on the evening of the 8th of August he was in Gray's-inn-lane, when he had occasion to turn up a court, called Fox's-court, and the moment he had done so he was seized by two men, one of whom grasped him tightly round the throat and almost strangled him. An attempt.was then made to force his watch from him, but the swivel broke, and while the thieves were endeavonring to get the chain over his head a person named Simpson entered thb court; and the prisoner, who was one of the men, arnd his companion ran off. The prosecutor was so much injured that he was unable to follow them, but Simpson did so, and never lost sight cf the prisoner until he secured him. The Jury returned a verdict of Gaily. The C03t eox SRJEAENT, in passing sentence, said that outrages of this description were becoming very frequent, and every means must be taken to put a stop to them. If the indictment had been framed in another form he should have been empowered to pass a sentence of transportatiori and that sentence would in all probability have been passed. Under the p resent indictment, however, the extent of punishmen t that would he inflicted was one of imprisonIment only, but he should give the fuLl amOunt of punish. ment directed by the law, which was that he he imprisoned iand kept to hard labour for two years. Cornelius Urell, 20, a gentlemaiily-looking young man, pleaded "Guilt' to an indictment charging him with forging an acceptance to a bill of exchange for 510l., with intent to defraud Charles Joachim Hambro. Mr. Giffard appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Thompson was counsel for the prisoner. The prisoner was in the service of Messrs. Barnes -and Co., merchants in the city, and bore a very good character, and it appeared that he had obtained possession of a letter that belonged to the firm which contained a number of iforeign bils of exchange, and among them the one inquestion, which was payable at 31essrs. Hambro and Co's. office; and it appeared that he forged the aeceptance of Messrs. Barnes auld Co. to the bill, and obtained the money. It seemed that almost immediately after the commission of the offence the prisoner repented of what he had done, and told his master what had occurred, at the same time handing over the bank-notes he had received. He afterwards accompanied the officer to the river Lea, and he there showed him where he had concealed a large number of sovereigns in a bag under some stones in the water. Tho other bils of exchange, it appeared, were destroyed, and the whole of the proceeds of the forgery, it appeared, were recovered. The prosecutor strongly recoinmmnded the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the Court. The CONrION SERJEANrT sentenced him to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour for 12 months. NEW COURT. (Before 11Th. PRc;NDxRncsSr, QC.) This Court was engaged during the principal part of the day trying prisoners for passing bad money. The cases did not' present any features of public interest. The nrumber of prisoners so charged was nnusuaLly small, there being only eight. The aver age committals during a period smilar to that which has elapsed since last session have for a long time past exceeded 20.
POLICE. MAnSION-HOUSE.-Jolm Crawley aud John Loveday were brought before the LORD MAYOR, charged with having robbed a corporal in the 6th Dragoon Guards, named William AM'Kelly, of his Crimean medal and some silver. The prosecutor, having been sworn, said,-On Saturday night last I went into the Union Coffee-shop, Union-street, vhere I met Crawley and a friend of his (not the other prisoner), and treated them to some coffee. I shortly after wards fell asleep, and when I awoke Ifound that my money had been taken from my pocket and that my Crimean medal had been cut from my coat. The prisoner Crawley and his companion had then left the house. Mr. B W. Bilton a sharebroker and dealer residin at Camberwell, said,-i was in the coffee-shop when the last witness awoke and complained of having lost his medal, but he could not give any account of the persons in whose com: any he had previously been.

The prisoner had upon sevefal previous occasions been remanded in consequence of the prosecutrix being, unable, from the frightful injuries vhich she had sustained, to attend.

He had threatened me; and upon one occasion he told me to remember Baker, and I mnderstood from what ho said that he alluded tea man who had murdered a womnan at Southampton. 9Ie bad told me that I had deceived him, but that I should never deceive another. After some further proceedings, Mr. BROUGHTON asked the prisoner what he had to say. Prisoner.-I am extremely sorry for having injured her; my mind and feelings were so- wounded that I could not master them. I knew not what I was doing. The prisoner was fully comniitted for trial at the Central Criminal Court for wounding with intent to marder.

He got the ring from her, after which she seised hold of his hand and -hit the hack of it. She then ran away. At this -time a police. man came up, who went in pursuit of her and overtook her. enryg Marsh, 169 Bproved having ta'ken the prisoner has not since been found, The prisoner was comulitted for tral. Peter Smith, lately in the Crimean Army Works Corps, was charged with embezzling various sums of money, the property of 31r. J. T. Jackson, dyer, Brompton, his employer, having been that day (yesterday) apprehended by Eergeant Loome at the Mechanics' Intitution, sestminster, where he had called to receive his money. Mr. Philpot was engaged for the prosecutGr, and Mr. Austin for the prisoner. The prosecutor stated that the prisoner entered his service in the month of January, 1855. - He received It. a-week, and wae allowed 5 per cent. on all orders he obtained from new customers. A few months ago be left this country and went to the Crimea. Since his departure he (prosecutor) had ascertained that he had received various sums of money which he had not accounted for. (The nrose=ntor produced eightbh;lswhichhad the prisoner'sreceipts attached to them.) In answer to a question, the prosecutor said that there were sums varying from 2s. and 3s. to 21. that the prisoner bad received. If the prisoner was remanded he should be able to prove the several charges agast him Mr. Austin said that he should be able to give a complete answer to the case on the day the prisoner should appear again. 31r. Felix L. Bauwen was summoned by Mr. Gibbs, superintendent of the B division, for having, in certain pre mises, used for the purposes of trade and manufactures situated in Ranelagh-road, Pimlico. known as the Patent Candle Company (imited), unlawfully used a certain furnace rot constracted so as to consume its own smoke. Mr. Bodldn, who attended to prosecute on the part of the Govermnent, stated thatgreat complaints were made bythe neighbours of the annoyance arising from the large quantity of smoke issuing from the defendant's chimneys. On the 3d of January last the defendant- was convicted for a similar offence, and the nuisance was now as bad as ever. There was at present only one charge against the defendant, but there were other chimneys complained of. Mr. William Sandeson, engineer, said that he was employed by the -Commissioners of Police to inspect the premises of the defendant, BHe went there on the 30th mnst., bultbefore be got to them be saw large quantities of smoke issuing from a lofty chiminey. This occurred repeatedly, and lasted from 7 to 10 minutes. He went into'the premises, where befounda large furnace which was not so constrcted as to consume its own smokse. They vere then burnin-g Welsh coal. On a subsequent occasion when he called he found that a bituminous coal -was uised. It would bevery easy to constract an apparatus by which the smoke of the furnace could be consumed. Mr. Inpector Andrews, B division, and Mr. Simons, late inspector of the same division, confirmed the evidence. Mr. Brook, manager of the company, stat that since the last conviction measures had been taken to have a patent apparatus. The defendant had been to several largImanufactuaers in order to find out where he could meetwith the best apparatus by which smoke could be consumed. He obtaine one o :Noland's patent, but it had not answered. Since the summons was taken out an apparAtus had been set up, which he thought would be satisfactory. - Mfr. AsNOLD observed that there were no mitigatingecircumstancesin the case. Since the 3d of January last the defendant had continued to use tbe furnaco without the apparatus, and he continued the offence up to the 30th of Yune. It was his duty to impose3a heavy penalty,' and-if he (the defendant) were brought-there agaim the fine would be incroaed. The defeldant was fined 101, which he immediately paid, A sum of 10s. has been received by the Magistrate, froim " I J R. W.," for the poor laundress Mrs. Roberts, which it is requested may be acknowledged in Tho Times.
