TEE ALLEGED POISONINGS I I AT RUGELEY. I TRIAL OF W. PALMER. I CENTA CRM'TAL COURT, X&Y i9. The court was again crowcded long before the commencemeOnt of the proceedings this morning. The Earl of Den. bihand LordLyttelton-were among the gentlemen who occupiedseats upon the bench. . The jury came into court shortly before 10 o'cloclr, and were soon followed by Lord Campbell and Mr. Justice Cresswell, accompanied by the Recorder, the Sheriffs and Under-Sheriffs, 2c. Mr. Baron Alderson did not take his seat until about 2 o'clock. The prisoner was immediately placed at the bar. There Was no alteration perceptible in his countenance or demeanour, and he took notes of several parts of Dr. Taylor's evidence. The Attorney-General, Mr E. James, Q.C., Mr. Welsby, Mr. Bodkin, and Mr. Euddleston appeared for the Crown; Mr. Serjeant Shoe, Mr. Grove, Q.C., Mr. Gray, and Mr. Kenealy for the prisoner. Dr. Alfred Sw,ayne Taylor, examined by the ATToR}nEx-. GEN-EPRL.-Iam a fellow of the College of Physicians, lecturer on medical jurisprudence at Guy's Eospital, and the author of the well-known treatise on poisons and on medical jurisprudence. I have nade the poison caled strychniathe subjectofamyattention. Itis theproduceof the nux vomica, which also contains brucia, a poison of an analogous character. Brucia is variously estimated at from one-sixth to one-twelfth the strength of strychnia. Most varieties of impure strychnia that are sold contain anore or less brucia. Unless, therefore, you are certain as to the purity of the article you may be misled as to its strength Ihave performed a variety of experiments with strychnix on animal life. I have never witnessed its action on a human subject. I have tried its effects apon animal life -upon rabbits-in 10 or 12 instances. 'l'he symptoms are, onthe whole, very uniform. The quantity I have given has variedfromhalfagraintotwograins. Malf agrainissufficient to destroy a rabbit. I have given it both in a solid and a liquid state. When given in a fluid state it produces its effects in a very few minutes; when in a solida state, as a sort of piU or bolus, in about six to eleven minutes. The time varies according to the strength of the dose, and also to the strength of the animaL In what way does it operate, in your opinion 9-It is first absorbed into the blood, then circulated through the body, and especially acts on the spmal cord, from which proceed the nerves acting on the voluntary muscles. Supposing the poison has been absorbed, what time would you give for the circulating process?-The circulation of the blood through the whole system is considered to take place about once in four minutes. The circulation in animals is quicker. The absorption of the poison by rabbits is therefore quicker. The time would also depend on the state of the stomach,-whether it contained much food or not, whether the poison came into immediate contact with the inner surface of the stomach. In your opinion, does the poison act immediately on the nervous system, or must it first be absorbed 9.-It must first be absorbed. The symptoms, you say, are uniform. Will you describe them9.-The animal for about five or sx minutes does not appear to suffer, but moves about gently; when the poison begins to actit suddenly falls on its side, there is a trembling, a quivering motion, of the whole of the muscles of the body, arising from the poison producing violent-.ud involuntary contraction. There is then a sudden paroxysm or fit, tho fore legs and the hind legs are stretched out, the head and the til are drawn back in the form of a bow,. the jaws are spasmodically closed, the eyes are prominent; after a short time there is a slight remission of the symptoms,and the animal appearstolie quiet, butthe lightest noise or touch reproduces anotherconvulsiveparoxysm; sometimes there is a scream, or a sort of a shriek, as if tae animal suffered from pain; the heart beats violently during the fit, and after a succession of these fits the animal dies quietly. Sometimes, however, the animal dies during a spasm, and I only know that death has occurred from holding my hand over the heart. The appearances after death differ. In some instances the rigidity continues. In one case the muscles were so strongly contracted for a week afterwards that it was possible to hold the body by its hind legs stretched out horizontally. In an animal killed the other day the body was flaccid at the time of death, but became igtd_aboutfie_mirnutes afterwards. I have opened the bodies of animals thus de&id7 Could you detect anyinjuryinthestomach?7.-Nlo. Ihave found in some cases congestion of the membranes of the spinal cord to a greater extent than would be accounted for by the gravitation of the blood. In other eases I have found no departure from the ordinary state of the spinal cord and the brain. I ascribe congestion to the succession of fits before death. In a majority of instances, three out of five, I found no change in the abnormal condition of the spine. In all cases the heart has been congested, especially the right side. I saw a case of ordinary tetanus in tho human subject years ago, but I have not had much experience of such cases. I saw one case lastThursday week at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The patient recovered. You have heard the descriptions given by the witnesses of the symptoms and appearances which accompanied Cook's attacks?-I have. Were those symptoms and appearances the same as those you have observed in the animals to which you adm inistered strychnine?.-They were. Death has taken place in the anmals more rapidly when the poison has been administered in a fluid than in a solid form. They have died at various periods after the administration of the poison. The experiments I have performed lately have been entirely in reference to solid strychnine. In the first case the symptoms began in 7 minutes, and the animal died (including those7) inl13minutes. In the second casethe symptoms appeared in 9 mmak3, and the animal died in 17. In the thrd case the symptoms appeared in 10 minutes, and the animal diedin 18. In the fourth case the symptoms appeared in 5 minutes, and death took place in 22. In the fifth case the symptoms appeared in 12 minutes, and death occurred in 23. If the poison were taken by the human subject in pills it would take a longer time to act, because the structure of the pill must be broken up in order tobring the poison in contact with the mucous membrane of the stomach. Ihave administered it to rabbits in pills. Wouldcpoison given in pills take a longer period to operate on a human subject than on a rabbit ?-I do not think we can draw any inference from a comparison of the rapidity of death in ahuman subject and in a rabbit. The ciorulation aEd absorption are different in the tw o cases. There is also a difference between one human subject and another. The strength of the dose, too, would make a difference, as a large dose would produce a more rapid effect than a small one. I have epernmented upon the intestines of animals, in order to reproduce the strychnia. The process consists inputting the stomach and its contents in alcohol, with a small quantity of acid, which dissolves the strychnia, ana prodauces suiphate of strychnia in the stomach. The liquid is thenfiltered, gently evaporated, ind an alkali added -carbonate of potash, which, mixed witha small quantityof sulphuric acid, precipitatesthestrychnia. Testsareapplledtotbe strycbnia, or snpposeda trychnia,when extracte. Strychnia has a peculiar stronglybittertaste. It is not soluble in water, but it is in acids and in alcohol. The colouring tests are applied to the dry residue after evaporation. Chauge of colour is produced by a mixture of sulphuric acid and bi-chromate of potash. It produces a blue colour, changing to violet and purple, and pawsing to red; but colouring tests are very fallacious, with this exceptionwhen ie have strychnine separated in its crystallized state we can recognize the crystals by their form and their chymical properties, and, above all, by the production of tetanic symptoms and death when administered through a woun. in the skin of animals. Are there other vegetable substances from which, if these colouring tests were applied, suiilar colours would be obtained?-There are a variety of mixtures which produce similar colours. One of them has also a bitter taste like strychnis. Vegetable poisons are more difficult of detection by chymical process than mineral poisons; the tests are far more fallacious. I have endeavoured to discover the presence of strychnine in animals I have poisoned in four cases, asisted by Dr. Bees. I have applied the process which I first described. I have then applied the tests of colouring and of taste. Were you able to satisfy yourself of the presence of strychnia.-In one case I discovered somebythecolour . In a second se there was a bitter taste, but no other indication of strynlnia. In *he other two cases there were no indications at all of stchnia. In the case where it was discovered hya colour .st two grains had been admuinistered;* and in the secmd case, where there was a bitter taste, one grain. In ene of the cases where we failed to detect it os grain, asd in thie other, half a grain had been given. How do you account for the absence of any indicaticon of strychnia in cases where youknow it was administerediIt is absorbed into the blood, and is no longer lix tb,I stomach. It is in a great partchanged in the blood, How do you account for its presence when admninisesd in large doses?-There is a retention of some ink exmOCe of what is required for the destructionof life. Supposing a miiMnRuM dose, which will destroy life, has been given, could you findw any?-o. It istakenuphy absorption andis no longer discoverable inthe stomach. The smallest quntit by which have destroyed the life of an animal ishif a; grain. There is no process 'with which I amacquaintedby whichit can bediscoveredin the tissuepu. As far as I know, a small quantity cannot be .iis. covered. Suppose half a grain to be ab3orbed into the bloocl, what I proportion does it bear to the total quantity of b,'ood cir- culated in the systei ?-Assuming the system to contain the lowrest quantity of lod, 2 it. woluld he 1 50th of a ~raintoapo dof lood.. A pby5idlan °,oce died from a dose of half a ain in 20 minutes. I Jelieve it undergoes some partial change in the blood, wch inreases the di.- cu1 y of discovering it. I '.ever heard of its being separated ron e tiss in a crystatlizAd 5tte, The crystals are eculiar in forn, but there are other organic crystalized snbetanes like them, xo that a chymist will aot rely on the form only. Alter the post morflea examination of Cook a portion of the stomach was sentto me. It was delivered to me by Ir. Boycott in , brown stone jar, covered with bladder, tied, and sealed. The jar contained tUie stomach and the intestines. I laTs experinented upon them with a view to ascertain if there was any poison present. I What poisons did you seek for in the first instace ?- Various,-prnssic acid, oxalic acid, morphia. strychnia, veratria, tobacco poison, hemlock, arsenic, antimony, mercur, and other mineral poisons. Did you find any of them ?-We only found small traces of antimony. Were the parts upon which gou had to operate in your search for strychnia in a favourable condition 9.-The mos3t unfavourable that could possibly be. The stomach had been completely cut from end to end, all the contents were-gone, and the fine mnucous surface, on which any poison, if present would have been found, was lying in contact wvith the outside of the intesines-all thrown together. The inside of the stomach was lyingi the mssof intestinal feculent matter. That was the fault or misfortune of the person who dissected?-I presume it was; but it seemed to have been shnaken about ia every possible way in the joamey to London. The contents of the intestines were there, but not the contents of the stomach, in which and on the mucoUs memlbrane I should have expected to find poison. By my own Iequest other portions of the body were set up to me,namely, the spleen, the two kidneys, and a small bottle of blood. They were delivered to me by 31r. Boycott. 'We had no idea whence the blood had been taken. We analyzed alL We searched in the liver and oneof the kidneys for mineral poison. Each part of the liver, one kidney, anu. the spleen all yielded antimony. The quantity was ess in proportioninthe spleenthan in the otherparts. Itwas reproduced, or brought out, by boiling the animal substance in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and water. Gall and copper water were also introduced, and the antimony was found deposited onthe cooper. We applied various tests to it-those of Professor Bi-andt, of Dr. Rlees, and others. I detected sonne antimony in the blood. It is impossible to say with precision howv recently it had been administered; but I should say within some days. The longest period at which antinony can be found in the blood after deatlh is eight days; the earliest period at which i. has been found after death, within my own knowledge, is 18 hours. A boy diedwithin S hours after taling it; and it was found in the liver. Antimony is usually given in the form of tartar emetic; it acts as an irritant, and produces vomiting. If given in repeated doses a portion would find its way into the blood and the system beyond what was ejected.. If it con.- tinued to be given after it had produced certain svmptoms it would destroy life. It may, however, be given with impunity. I heard the account given by the female servants of the frequent voniiting or Mr. Cook, both at Rugeley and at Shrewsbury, and alsothe evidence of Ir. Gibson and Mr. Jones as to the predominant symptoms in his case. Vomitings produced by antimony would cause those symptoms. If given in small quantities sufficient to cause vomiting it would not affect the colour of the liquid in wvhich it was minLxed, whether brandy, wine, brotb, or water. It 's impossible to form an exact judgment as to the time when. the antimony was administered, but it must have been within two or three weeLs at the outside before death. There was no evidence that any had been given within some hours of death. It might leame a sensation in the throat-a choking sensation-if a large quantity was taken at once. I found no trace of mercury dunng the analysis. If a few grains hada been taken recently before death I should have expected to find some trace. If a man had taken mercury for a syphilitic affection within two or three weeks I should have expected to find it. It is very slow in passing out of the body. As small a uantity as three or four grains might leave some trace. I recollect a case in which three grains of cal6mel were given three or four hours before death, and traces of mercury were found. Half a grain three or four days be. fore death, if favourably given, and not vomited, would, I should expDect, leave a trace. One grain would certainly do, so. I heard the evidence as to the death of MIrs. S3roytb, Agnes French, and the other lady mentioned, and also aS to the attack of Clutterbuck-. From your own experience in reference to strychnine do you coincide in opimon with the other witnesses, that the deaths in those cases were caused by strychnine' R-Yes. Did the symptoms in CooL's case appear to be of a similar chaacter to the symptoms in those cases ?-They did. As a professor of medical science, do you know any cause in the range of human disease except strychnine to which the symptoms in Cook's case can be referred ?-I do not. Cross-examined by Ir. Serjeant STxa.-I mean by the word " trace" a very small quantity, which can hardly be estimated by weight. I do not apply it in the sense of am imponderable quantity. In chyncal language it is frequently used in that sense. An inflinitesimal quantity would be called "a trace." The quantity of antimony that we discovered in all parts of the body would make up about half a grain. We did not ascertain that there was that quantity, but I will undertake to say that we extracted as much as half a grain. That quantity would not be sufficient to cause death. Only arsenic or antimony could have been deposited, under the circumstances, on the copper, and no sublimate of arsenic was obtained. [The witness, in reply to a further question, detailodthe elaborate test which he had applied to the deposit, in order to ascertain that it consisted of antimony.] Would a mistake in any one of the processes you have described, or a defect in any of the materials you used, defeat the object of the test 7-It would, but all the materials I used were pure. Such an accident could not hbve happened nithout my having some intimation of it in the course oE the process. I should think antimony would operate more with tne works of Orfila. He stood inthe highest rank of analvtical chym^sts Di)d not Orfila find antimony in a dog four months after injection 9.-Yes; but the animal had ta'k-en about 45 gramns. gMr. Serjeant SnIE called ihe attention of the witneas to a passage in Orfila's work in reference to that case, to the effect that the antimony was found accumulating in the bones, the liver contamed a great deal, and the tissues a. very little. Witness.-Yes; when antimony has been long in the body it passes into the bones; but I think you wil find that these are not Orfila's experiments. Orfila is quoting the expeiments of another person. But is not that the case with nearly all the experiments referred to in your own book?-No - I cannot say that. Mr. Serjeant Snnu again referred to a case in Or.ft&r im which 45 grains were given to a dog, and three and a-half months after death a quantity was found in the fat, andsome in the liver, bones, and tissues. Witness.-That shows that antimony gets into the bones and flesh, but I never knew a case in which 45 grains had been given, and I have given no opinion upon such a case. A pretty good dose is required to poison a person, I suppose .-That depends on the mode in -which it is given. A, dog has been poisoned with sixgrains. The dog died in the case you mentioned. When antimony is adiunistered as iv. was in that case the liver becomes fatty and gristled. Cook's liver presented no appearance of the sort. I should' infer that the antimony we found in Cook's body Was givea much more recently than in the e.xperiments you have described. We cannot say positivel how longit takes to get out of the body, but I have known three grains cleared out in 24 hours. I was first applied to in this case on Thursday, the 27th of November, by Mr. Stevens, vwo was introduced. to me by Mr. Warrington, professor of chymistry. Either then or subsequently he mentioned Mr. Gardner. I ha&. not known Mr. Gardner before. Ihad neverbefore been. concerned in cases of this kind at Rugeley. Mfr. Serjeant SHER read the letter written by Dr. TaylDrto Mr. Cardner:- "Chymical Laboratory, Guy's Hospital, Dec. 4, 1856& Ree J. P. Cook, Esq., deceased.

SADLER'S WELLS THEATBE. Last night the frequenters of this pleasant little suburbani theatre, which has been rendered classic by the energy and taste of Mr. Phelps, enjoyed a musical treat of an unusual kind. It was the first of a series of operatic performanees, under the direction of Mr. Howard Glover, the composer, whose undertaking was inaugurated by Mr. Balfe's Boheinan Girt, one of the most popular works of the day, not only in England, where it was originally produced, but on the continent. This was presented under auspicious circumstances, since not only was the cast very strong-comprising Mr. Sims Reeves as Thaddeus, Mrs. Sims Reeves as Arhline, Mr. Weiss as Count Axnheim, Miss Poole as the Gipsy Queen, and Mr. Delavanti as Devilshoof-but there was an orchestra which, though small, was extremely efficient, including in its ranks some of the best players from the Italian operas, and conducted by Mr. Balfe himself. The house was crowded to the roof; and from the overture to the end the opera was thoroughly enjoyed. The audience were reaUy enthusiastic, and not merely applauded the music-song after song, concerted piece after concerted piece-but, what is better, listened with attention, which gave them a right to pronounce upon its merits. The reception accorded to Mr. Balfe, when he first made his appearance in the orchestra, wasaguaranteethathispopuarity inI,ondon is not confined to the south side of the New-road. It was nothing short of uproarious. The general execution of the Bohemian Girl-for which a competent chorus, no less than a competent orchestra, had been judliciously provided by Mr. Glover-was of an order uite unprecedented in these remote regions. Ar. Sims eeves, who, for some years, has been an immense favourite at Sadier's-weUs as a concert singer, was, as a matter of course received with acclamations, which were renewed over and over again at each effective Point of the performance. His two ballads-" When other lips and other hearts," and "The fair land of Poland"-were encored in a tumult of applause. We need not, however, describe so wel known a performance as the Thaddeus of this gentleman, nor the graceful impersonation of Airline by Mrs. Sims Reees, which is just; as familiar. She, too, completely won the favour of the Sadler's-wells habitu.s, and was compelled, in obedience to the unaniincus wish, to repeat the tuneful and pretty romance, "I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls," which she sang with great arehness, and in a style which Italian critics designate as "synipatieo." Another encore, and. equally well merited, was awarded to a new balad, "No more I'l join the dance and song," given with much sweetness by Miss Poole. This was written by Mrr. Balfe for the occasion; and the -words being ap- ,os of tho Gipsy Queen's rejection by Thaddeus, when Ar=ine solicits him to choose betweeif them, comes in naturally enough (more so, by the way, than one or two of its predecessors and companions). Nor were the zealous awarders of distinction unpropitious to MIr. Weiss, who, in a ballad once precious to amateur performers on the cornet-ipiston ("The heart bowed down"), was erncored, like his comrades, and deserved the complinent. So far as the audience were concerned, indeed, we believe they would willingly have listened twice to almost every mo0reeaZj; but, being on the whole considerate in the midst of eiithusiasm, they ins-isted upon no more than five repetitions. At the end of the opera 3fr. Balfe was loudly and unanimously summoned. When he had appeared and bowed his acknowledgments there was a regular shout for " Sims Reeves," who came forwardwith his cara sposa; and, lastly, Miss Poole was led on, at the bidding of the greatly delighted public. We should mention that, although Mr. Delavanti mad no solo air entitling him to honours apart, he made a very spirited representative of Devilshoof-a queer personage the conception and dramatic treatment of which are essentially Bunn-ian. Altogether Mr. Howard Glover's attempt to innoculate the Isnogtonians with a taste for good music, well performed, has commenced with an cclat that promises well for the issue. After the Bohemian irsl the farce of Z77c Dead Slhot was performed, in which the character of Louisa Lovetrick was played with remarkable sprightliness by dliss Fanny Bland (a granddaughter of the late Mrs. Glover). It was her first appearance on the Bondon stage, and the impression she produced was highly favourable. Auber's Era Diavoto is !announced for Veea

PARLIA2IENTARY ThTBLlIG6ECE. HOUSE OF LORDS, MOhDAY, MAY 19. The :DOn CRANCELLOP, took his seat on the woolsaclk at 5 o7clock. l MARITTIZE lAW. Lord COLCHESTER gave notice that on Thursday next he would move the following resolution:- " That the most eminent jurists of all ages bave accepted as a principle of international law, that the right of captusring an enemy's goods on board of neutral vessels is inherent in all belligerent Powers. That the maintenance of this right is of essential importance, and its abandonment of serious injury to a Power whose main reliance is nn her naval superiority. That Great Britain, consequently, although occasionally waving the exercise of the right by specific treaties, has invariably refused to recognize the abandonment of a principle which successive Governments have concurred in considering identified with her national great- ness. That this House deeply regrets that a principle so i long and so strenuously maintained should, in the recent Conferences at Paris, have been suddenly abandoned without the previous sanction or mnowledge of Parliament by plenipotentiaries assembled for the purpose of discussing the terms on which peace with Russia might be concluded and the affairs of the East satisfactorily adjusted." TRANSPORTATION. Earl STAN-EOPB gave notice that on Friday he would move for the appointment of a select committee to inquire intoeprovisions of the l7th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 99, 1 intitled "An Act to substitute in certain Cases certainPunishments in lieu of Transportation." CENTRAL AMERICA. The Earl of ELG7'1 said, a letter had appeared in the papers of this country, copied from the American journals and bearingthe signature of "'B. Hammond," purporting to bea reply fron the Govern ment of this country to an application of the Costa-Ricans for arms. As considerable importance attached at the present momient to any proceedings on the part of the Government of this country with regard to Central America, he wished to ask the noble I lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs whether that letter was a genuine document, and, if his reply should be in the affirmative,whether he had any intention to lay on the table of the house the letter of the 12th of January, to which it purpqrte& to be a reply? The EFrl of CLA6RENDON had no hesitation, in answer to the question of the noble earl, in saying that the letter of Mr. Hammond published in the papers was a genuine letter, and that it arose from the following circumstances :-The agent of the Costa Rican Government in this country, and the agents of other South American States, ever since the attack made by Walker on the Government of Nicaragua, have applied to this country to assist them to defend themselves. A great variety of proposals had been laid before the British Government for accepting the protectorate of these countries, and for givingthemassistance. To allthosepro. posals the British Government had invariably replied in the negative. The British Government said that they had nothing to he with the affairs of Central America, though they were sorry for the attacks made on Nicaragua. They also said that they had the more reason to deplore those attacks because the property of British subjects had been not only endangered but sacrificed by Walker, and therefore they should be very glad that his bucaniering enterprise should not be carried further; but with any interference with the affairs of Central America they were determined to have nothing whatever to do, and that all their action would be limited to sending just such a naval force to the coast of South America as would be sufficient to protect British interests and British property. Mr. Wallerstein was greatly disappointed at this answer. Allusion was also made to the interest shown by the British Government for Central America, and the bad return made by the Govetnments there for what had been done for them. An exception, however, must be made in this respect in favour of the Government of Costa Rica, which was a reg_lar Government, and had always kept its engagements with the British Government. Mr. Wallerstein then replied that there was a great quantity of British property accumulated in Costa Rica, which might be protected by a naval force, and added that the Costa-Ricans were determined to make a stand agaist the invasion of their country by Walker; but he said that they had not the means of repelling. the a eon they apprehended, and inquired whether tht British War Department would not give them a fewv arms for the purpose. He (the Earl of Clarendon) stated that he could not give an answer. until inquiries were made of the War Department, and when the answer was received the substance was communicated in Mr. Hammond's letter. The fact was, however, that hr. Wallerstein did not consider himself entitled to accept the i offer, and he had since died; so that no interference, even in that indirect way, had taken place in the affairs of Costa Rica. Some time since Walker took possession of Nicaragua and British property there; he (the Earlof Clarendon) communicated with the Government of the United States, and Mr. Crampton, in a despatch, reported a conversation he had on the 15th of March with M1r. Marcy, there being no disguise with the Government of the United States as to what the British Government were doing, their only wish being to protect British property. Mr. Marcy then said that the Government of the JUmted States entirely disapproved and regretted the existing state of things in Niclargn wihiol tlhey-thollghv-anmerorus and cacubtiOd to cast a shade on the repuitation of theUlnited States; that they were as anxious as the British Government to see the Government of Walker rooted up, and were determined to take measures for the redress of injuries indieted on citizens of the UJnited States. Unlder these circum,stances, he (the Earl I of Clarendon) intimated that there could be uo better plan than for the Governument of the United States and the British Government to combine together for the protection of the property of the citizens of both countries. (Hear, hear.) CIRCASSIA. The Earl of MALMIESBURY asked, whether it was true that the Circassians had made a representation or presented some diplomatic paper to the Porte, asling for the interference ofthe allies in favour of theirindependence, and also for protection against Russian aggression? He also inquired whether the British Government had received any paper to that effect,; and, if so,whether there would hoe any objection to laying a copy on the table of the house ? He likewise desired to knowv whether the Foreign Secretary had any objection to lay on the table the notes presented to the English and French Governments by the S.ardinian Government, and which he believed had been laid before the Sardinian Par]iament? *The Earl of CLAREN7DON said, it was true that a deputation had come from Circassia to the Porte; but hehbad not received from the British Ambassador any document except the letter from the Circassian chiefs to the Queen. |Nothing had been addressed to the British Government. WVhat the Circassians desired was that their independence shouald be secuAred, and that application they made in consequence of having heard that peace was signed; and he had to observe that the person who was at the head of the deputation and was their spokesman was not a Circass.an, and had during the two years of war been anythingbut friendly to the allies. That individnal was the person who mainly |prevented the fortifications of Anapa being destroyed, and was one of the greatest agents of Russian power. Therefore he did not thin that these persons had any claimn upon the |allies.'t With respect to the Sardinian note, there would be !no objection to laying a copy on the table. CRIMINAL JUIJBSDICTION IN SCOTCH BUYRGHS. L ord BROUGHAM p resented a petition from the Convention of Scotch Bnrghs, complaining of the wrant in those burghs of criminal jurisdiction asto petty offences. INDI : The Earl of AL,BEMARLE rose to move the a ppointmuent of a select committee on the government of Indian territories. He said a committee on the samne subject sat in 1853, but since then, for some reason he was not awrare of, its services had not been called into requisition. The object of the committee was to inquire into the Indian Bill of 1833. at the end of the session of 1833 the speech firom the Throne stated that. that act had been framed for, the happiness and welfare of - the people. The committee of 1853 occupied itseif in anquiring into all that related to places, patronage. and pover, hut on all subjects relating to the materala and social condition of the people of India, and on all points relating to their happiness or misery, he behieved there was not a shadow of investigation. Therefore, if there wrere no other reason, that would be a sufficient ground for the resumption of the labours of the committee~ Her MLajesty's Ministers intimated their intention of bringing in abill in 1853, without any of that evidence whioh they were p lodged by their programme to enter into, and in violation of all former precedent. The consequence was that a bill had been carried, which had been very weEl characterized by a petition from India, as containing no provision calculated to improve the condition of the people or to redress the grievances of which they had complained. There had been whispers of a letter from the GovernorGeneral of India, declaring that inquiry would endanger British rule in India. So that the power that had overthrown Hyder and Tippoo, that had hurled the Great Mogull from his throne, and had sustained the loss of a whole army in a foolhardy expedition against 3 distant neighbour, Was to be endangered by an inquiry conducted 10,000 miles from India. T e plea was Iaoaever admitted, and Parliament passed the crade and illconsidered bill of 1853, by which the East India Company were reinvested with i-responsible power. Parliament had legislated -without inquiry, and had at the same moment burked inquiry, and yet the subject was well worthy of Parliamentary investigation. Their lordships table had groaned with petitions from all parts of India, complaining of the excessive amount of taxation, of the barbarous mode of assessment, of the. cruelty with which the collection was made, of the absence of due provision for the education of the people, of the disgraceful. condition, of the local courts of justice arising from delay, expense, and inefficiency, of the neglect of public works, such as canals, roads, bridges, and waterworks. What had Parliament gained by burking inquiry ? It was afterwards casually discovered that there existed in India a system' of. torture, and there also transpired the appaing fact that'its existence was known to the East India Corn pany andto the covenanted servants of the Company, but had been concesled not only from Parliament and from the people of this country, but also from the Governor-General, from thegovernors of provinces, and from Her Majestfs responsible advisers, who bhut for the juggle of 'a double government, would have been responsible for the -atrocities in question, if, indeed, such atrocities could have existed under a responsible Government.' This discovery had brought miuch obloquy upon this cotntry, aid the eyes of thewhole civilized world were upon us. One foreigni author, who had vi.ited Ildia, said that from. one end of the countryto the other he had.never heard but one word"1 PRvenue." Let their' lordsilhps Dave an inquiry whether this wed "revenue'> might not hve ?omethting to do with thehorriblesystemof torture. Eetrustedthattheywould not be content with the apology and extenuation that torture existed in India because it had been customary. The Court of Directors, in a despateh dated the l2th of September, 1855, said that torture existed because it had been handed down from the less civilized and less humane nations that preceded us. But our Indian government must. be based upon an European model, and not upon the principle of Aatic despotism, which meddled with everything and ercted 19-20ths of the prodae of the people. Bat he doubted whether these barbanians were so black as the directors had represented, for Tmouor the' Tartar had ordained that the collection of taxes shoud be enforced. when necessary, by menaces and threats, but never by whips and scourges. Timoaralso ordinedthatxesshouldnotbelevied in a manner productive of ruim to the subjects or depopulationtothe country. Ifacommitteewere appointed, onesabject of their inquiry would be the condition of the pablic works. It would bo found that the roads were in a disgraceful condition, and that the people were in the same state of despondency for want of a market, in consequence of the neglect of the roads, as they were in the year 1846. There is as little protection from tamine for want of irrigation to the great majority ot the people in 56 as in 1840. Of the necessity of such works as these he presumed none of their lordships were ignorant. Millions of the inhabitauts of Asia depended upon worlks of irrigation alone. Their more izse predecessors were well aware of the necessity of those works; but for three quarters of a century they have been neglected. Since the accession of the able nobleman, who had lately left the government of India, something had been done. But what was that something? There were one or two, or perhaps more great works of irrigationin the Punjab. There was thegreat Scinde Canal, the great Ganges Canal in the province of Agr, and there was the West oast Canalin Madras. There were the expensive works of navigation in the three great southern provinces. But -what did all this amount to ! Here were seven localities affecting at the very most 20 out o£ the 120 provinces into which India was divided. Those localities were more than 12 times as large as Great Britain; and those 20 provinces were improved at the expense of the whole community. For what bad not been done he did not hold the noble and distinguished marquis responsible. He -was sent out 'to India to administer a system sanctioned by the Government and by Parliament, but which was not-the less a system at variance with every principle of political science. All that zeal, enterprise, and energy could do that noble lord had done; but he (the Earl of Albemarle) contended that it was a system under which-no country- ever did or ever couald prosper. The constraction of public works formed no part of a wholesomb and well regulated Government. Such works came within the province of private enterprise and private capitaL But in a country where the Government was despotic and extortionate, in a country where the ta-xes were very variable, arbitrary, multitudinous, and excessive, where nineteen shillings oat of every pound of the whole revenue of the country were taken bythe Government, where the Government appropriated to itself everything it could get, and where the administration of justice was in a most miserable condition-iu such a country no moneyed man in his senses could possibly embark in those works. There was one more point connected with this subject,-no public works alone could possibly have anv effect unless accompanied by measures of such a nature as he believed impossible to be established under the existing form of government. There could be no greater proof of this than was afforded by the district in the immediate vicinity where these works were takzing place. With re-"ard to the administration of justice he would not now spe4, because that would properly form the subject of discussion when he brought forward another motion the' terms of which he had already placed on the table. But he would simply refer theirlordahipsto an observation whieh had been made by men well conversant with the subject, that the administration could not be satisfactorily conducted in consequence of the naucity of the officers. There wereornv 74 officers inthe prestdency of Madras, which contained 2,000,0W0 people. It was the opinion of Mr. Eliot, one of the members of the Government, that the present system of government was such that an inmrease of officers was impossible; and yet without such an increase he believed that the abolition of torture could not be effected. He felt that he had now stated sufficient to justify him in asking their lordships to appoint a committee to resume their labour just where the committee of 1853 left it. The noble earl concluded by moving the appointment of a select committee on the government of Indian territories. Earl GRAI-VILLE did not suppose that it was the intention of the noble earl to press his motion uapon their lordships, but that he had taken a legitimate mode of giving their lordships a statement of his vievws connected with the government of India-a question in which the noble earl took a very great interest. It did not appear to him (Earl Granville) that the noble earl had sufficiently made out a case for his motion. The noble earl had complained of the hasty manner in which the present act for the government of India was passed, it having become the law before the public had sufficient time to conduct the investigation which the state of India demanded. Their lordships were aware that the subject of the government of India was inquired into by two committees of Parliament, and which committees went deeply and widely into the subjects brought before them. The noble earl had stated that he understood the Government were much influenced by a letter received from Lord Dalhousie, in which that noble lord strongly expressed his opinion that great inconvenience would arise from any greaterdelaytaking place and the whole of thepeople of India being left under a Government of an unstable character and only of a prbviftionarmne.- IeT dT -,'i,Srr-' ence to that letter vas averyhappy illustration of the motion by the noble earl-by which, soon after the passing of that act, he proposed that their lordships should appoint a committee to do exactly that which l.ord Dalhousie deprecated -namely, creating in the minds of the people of India a belief that there vras an intention on the part of Parliament to make some great and immediate changes in regard to the government of that country. The chief ground on which the noble earl based his motion was with regard to public works. He (Earl Granville) was not fuUy possessed of a knowledge of all the details in reference to that subject, but he believed that the only question under the able and energetic management of the late Governor-General was, whether he should push on these works by means of borrowed money, instead of allow-~ ing it to be said that there had been the slightest delay or want of energy in carrying them on. The determination of Lord Dalhouise was to force on the works, and, accordingly, in every part of India, they were carried on by money borrowed at high interest. So far, therefore, from there having been any neglect in that respect, it was one of the brightest points connected with the administration of Lord Dalhiousie. The noble earl had again adverted to the qaestion oftorture. But the noble earl had not ventured to say that since the fact of torture had been proved to exist the government at home or in India had neglected any means in their power in the most searching manner to inquire into the practice. But with regard to the constitution of the government of India this torture case did not appear to himto have any bearing at alL The noble earl oppsite (the Earl of Ellenborough) remarl-ed the other day that he never heard during his administration of the govermnent of India of any case of torture taking place in that country. The opinion held by thoso possessing: the soundest knowledge was, that the government of India, to be carried on with effect, must be carried on in India itself- and it wasa point not to be forgotten by their lordships tiiat whatever change they might be disposed to make in' the government of India, no change could be made in the great experiment now being made-that of admitting the civil servants by open competition-til the result of that experiment had been fullY established. The noble lord, while professing not to speak on the subject of judicial proceedings in India, had yet brought forward certain vague charges in connexion with that subject. WVhat the noble earl ought to do was to bring forward some particular case of hardship, and to show that under the present state of things no efforts were being made likely to produce amendment. Believing, as he did, that it was a great evil to unsettle the minds of all Inldia by committees of in quiry into charges of avaguleandgeneralcharacter,theonlyeffectofwhich would he to lead the natives of that country to suppose that theyv ere living muder an unstable form of government, he could not agree to the motion of the noble earl, and he trustedthat he would not press it upon the acceptance of the House. (Hear, hear,) 'The Earl of ELLElNBOROUGEH was quite ready, in the event of a comnmittee being proposed with a view to organic changes, to concur, in the view just taken by the noble earL There could be no doubt that to entertain questions of that kind would tend to unsettle the mimds of the people of India,-but he should be extremely sorry to come to the cohclsion that they were precluded from making inquiryinto the internal administration of the affairs of India. (HIear, hear.) He thought there might be occasionally great advantage in directing the eye of the public of this country' hi the' internal administration of India, and he should be extremely sorry to preclude the possibility of such matters being investigated by committees of that House. IHe had in his possession an official paper, purporting to contain an account of the fiances of Idia, and he must say that in that paper alone he saw enough to just a committee of this kind. (Hear, hear.) He found it stated, for example, that the cost of collection of the revenue, chiefly derived from land in lthe north-western provinces, was 9j per cent.; in Bengal, 10 per cent.; in Bombay, 13 per cent.; in the Bunlab, 14.'. p)er cent.; and in Madras, 17 per cent. Now, he realty thlought that where there was so great a difference in the cost of collection as in one case per cent., and in another 17 per cent., there was a good case for inquiry. (Hear, hear.) In the north-western provinces 05,0001. of Customs vws coucted at a cost of 72,OOOl. leaving 23,0001. to go to the revenue. (Hear, hear.) In Bengal the receipts from the Customs' were 768,0001.- in Bombay, 295,0001. ; but the expense of collecting the small amount at Bombay was co?ssiderably greater than that of collecting the large amount in Bengal. fHear, hear.) Such things as these were matters for inquiry, and might be investigated without impairing in any way the respect and efficiency of the government of India. He would most earnestly suggest, what he had done two years ago, the appointment of an independent audit for India. This was done by every country that desired to have its affAirs conducted with propriety and honesty- andhe would recommend the' Government, without any Aelay, to bring in abill to establish a board of audit, having no dependezice on the government of India, to examine the accounts of that country.' (Hear, hear.)- I a few days he hoped to call the attention of the House to the mode in which -the directors carried out the act of Parliament re- quiring them to lay on the table of Pirhiament an annual' account of the charges of India. -The paper which had been presented, and to which he hid already referred, was not in acoordance with the provisions of the act ; and he regarded this s one among otherpointswhich cilled forthe strict vigilanceof Parliament. (Hear.) -He -had great onfidence in the wisdom and energy of- those who were appointed Governors-General of - India; but he wished to, tive them assistance, -with6ut -which 'he 'did not believe they could thoroughly discharge their duty. Rethought' that a7nong the oprivale secretaries d the Governor-General there slsould bone :nlish gamtleinan of the highest quahific7ations, snd holdingapetesainiilar i to' £hat' obeupied 'b:r de-ce eeAio i;j ths ~oznatz. Wh9 Gvernor-(;gene had not time, =ad, therefore, it was quite impossible. for him to do all things himself, aad he would be assisted to the greatest degree if she Government P laced at his diqposal ian fficer, similarto apersonof thedescriptionof an UnderSecretary of State, from London. LEe trusted that the Houwe wlould not be thoughbt, by not agreeing to the present motion, to be precluded from taking up in committee the considerationof the internal administration of aff-drs in India. The3isarquis of CLA2IRICA1tDE observed that, it appeared that great mistakes had been committed in the returns laid on the table. On a late occasion, at the Indiahouse, the Chairman of the India Comnpany went into ;a elaborate account of the state of the finanlces laid cf the defict of the last two vear The chairman endeavour.ed to show tnat the deficit was caused by the money expended for public works during that period, but he made the amount laid out on public works at variance with the accounts placed on theirlordships'table. Thereturns madethetotal expendeel for that purpose during the year 1S53-54, 621,411. - but Colonel Sykes made the amount no less than 2,52,0004 Therewas a great discrepancy also in the two statemenLt 'with respect to the amount Laid out in the-year 1854-55, and he thought that this wvas a matter which called for inquiry, for ever since the year 1784 the debt of India had gone on increasing eteadily. The finances of India were administered in such a way as to,ead to the unsatisFactoy conclusion that sooner or later the tarpayers of the united kingdomTwouldhavetopaythecost.ethotughtthat'thesewere matters for inquiry, but he could not agree with the noble earl who last spoke, that a more extensive inquiry in refer^ ence to the foncdations on which the govermment in India rested was not desirable. That was a most serious matter for inquiry, for the Government in India did not rest on the affections of the people, anu unless some step were tl-en to make the governnentin accordance 'with every principle that history, theory, and exerience pointed out as the foundation of government, Brtish rulein India couldinotlast except so long as it was maintained by the force of arms. There was this peculiar circumnstance to be borne in mind, that by the education and information afforded to the natives principles of the most liberal and, he might also say, repub-lican nature were instilled into their minds. It was impossible that tie present state of things couald last long. The natives of India must be brought into the government, or the government never could be safe. Every year petitions were piesented,detailing the grievances of the people of India. They held public meetings and had a free press, and it was therefore impossible that the present state of things should go on. The only effectual mean of. reducing the expenditure of the Indian administration was by employing the natives instead of the more exPensive Europeans. .Many high authorities, including the Duke of Wellington, had borne testimony to their administrativa powers, and tlere could be no doubt they were capable of filling many offices, the duties of which they would be glad to discharge. Why should not the natives be allowed to administer iustice in its higher branches, which ma-ny of them were wel qualified by their learing to do? TheEuropeans, however, had a monopoly of everything thatwas good. As soon as the people of this country could. be made to see that itwas their money of which the Court of Directors-were disposing they would demanda reform in the admiistration of that country. The income of India was really the income of the Crown, and upon the people of this - country would rest the duty of disharging the debt of India. The motion was then put and negatived without a division. MARRIAGE LAW AM EN1DIENT BTlL Lord BROUGHAM, on moving that the House go into comnmitteeon this bill, said thathe found so mnch opposition to the clauses of this bill relative to divorce and legitimacy, that he had thought it better to con6ne it to oneo single object. He did not propose to alter the marriage law in Scotland at nll, but to give protection to the marnagelaw of England by preventing the gross evasion of its proviiouns which the difference of the two laws occasioned. e had seen a statement signed by 19 rev. gentlemen of all sects in Berwick-upon-Tweed, setting forth that the great grievance to w-hich the morals of the people were subjected by the practiee of persons passing the border forthe purpose of being married was such that it wras nmpossibleto describe to w-hat degree bigamy, seduction, and bastardy were practised in that district. Se agreed that the Scocth law on the subject of marriage wvas in a most unsatisfactory state, but this measure had no connexion 'whatever with that law. He knew that in Scotland fixec and rooted opinion had set in that a larger explanation of the law on this subject ought to bh given. But the evil he complained of was, that the present law of Scotland enabled the English law to be entirely set at nought. Hiis impression was that their lordships would do a wise thing to con6ne themoselves, for the p resent, at least, to going no further than the measure then before their lordships. They should act apon a principle which he believed was not confined to Scotland-to get what they could, and k;eep whatthey got. Upon this principle he had proceededinliraitianzhis endeavour on the present occasion to protect the law of England and the people of 13ngland. HEe had therefore confined it to irregular marriages. The noble and learned lord said it was a grievous thing to leave the law of divorce in such a state of conflict, and the courts in such a state as to make it an impossibility to administer the law satisfactorily, in consequence of his being obliged to limit this bill to the single ppoit of irregular marriages. There-were cases nearly connected with their lordshiips Rlouse in which the circumstances of the uncertainty of the legality of the marriage of the parties might by possibility ase. It was not quite certain that even a Scotch judgment of legitimacy would not be reversed when it came up totheir lordships' House by way of appeal, although the -eoteh- 1asrbed a.u -separnies- wveTe~-enIftd - to marry again after a Scotch divorce. Considering all the diversitv of law on the subject and the conflicts that 'were perpetually arising, Ie did earnestly hope that their lordaps would at least make a beginning inthe amendment of the law, by assenting to a bill which would accomplish the object of assimilating the Scotch and English law on the subject of marriage. Lord CAMPBELL thought the bill would not addlto the lustre of the name of his noble andlearned friend, because it would not accomplish what it professed to do. His noble and learned friend proposed that those marriages which lie called irregular.maranes should not be legal unless the parties had been domicned for three weeks in Scotland. He (Lord Campbell) believed that this would be no remnedy at all, but would be the cause of a great deal of fresh doubt upon the subject. Hisnobleandlearnedfriendhad introduced a new element of doubt as to regular and irregular marriages. What was an irregular marriage? If an Episcopalian bishop performt-da marriage in Scotland, .hat he beYieved would be an irregular marriage. Slarriages could not be - legally performed by any Episcopalian wvithiri the realmi of Scotland. All such marri3ges erve irregular,- and | any persons so married might he srummoned hefore the Court of Session and be rebuked for living as man and wife without being regularly mnarried. A marriage by a seceding minister would not be a legal marriage. It must be by a minister of the established churcb, after the due proclamation of bans. He did not thirk his noble and learned friend would effect any great remedy by this bill, and that he would only introduce new difficulties into the question if he carried it. Itwould not operate in mitigation of the evils complained of, and he hoped, therefore, his noble and learned friend would not press it. The Earl of ABERDEEN would give the bill his cordial support. Though he desired to preserve as it -was the law of Scotland affecting marriage, he had not the least wish to throw any obstacle in the way of preventing evasion of the law of En-land. *With xegard to marringes .n Scotland, all were hMd irregular that were not solemnized after the proclamation of bans, and the contracting of an irregular marriage subjected the parties to ecclesiastical censul-e, ana, he believed, to penalties, though it was valid in law.. He could not admit the accuracy of the description gi-en by the noble and learnedlord, andhe would only say that the marriage lawr in Scotland WS in accordance with the wishes of a people at least as intellectual as themselves. The bill then went through committee. The Procedure Before Justices (Scotland) Bill, and the Bankers Composition Bill were both read a second ti:ne. Their lordships adjourned at a quarter past 7 c'clr.

I thoroughly agree with you that those bands have afforded 'an innocent and healthful enjoyment on the Sunday afternoons, to which the people have a right;' but I think it essential that the working people should of themselves, and by themselves, assert that right.

LONDON TUESDAY, MAY 20, 156. In the House of Lords yesterday, The LORD CA.Nomon, in reply to a question from the Earl of DoNIoUGuxoE, stated that there was no intention on the part of the Government to abolsh the Irish ecclesiastical courts, but it was proposed to establish in Ireland a court having the power to try suits and pronounce sentence in cases of divorce. The-National Gallery Bill was read a first time. - Earl STAxn[OPZ gave notice that he should on Friday next move for a committee of inquiry into the effects of the xubstitution of penal servitude for traportation as a secondary punishment. The Earl of EGwix read the letter recently pub. lished in the newspapers purp4W't-gto be an answer from the Foreign-office to a request from the agent of the Government of Costa Rica for a supply of arms; he asked t'ne Earl of CLx nmDo- if that letter was genuine; and, if so, whether he had any objection to lay on the table a copy of the application to which the letter appeared to be the answer? The Earl of CLARENDoN stated that the letter, as published, was perfectly genuine. Some time after the attack of WATxER On Kicaragua the agents for the Government of Costa Rica, and other Governments of Central America, applied to the English Government for assistance. Several plans by which that assistance could be given were proposed, and it was suggested that England should take the protectorate of those countries. That offer was declinedthe English.Government was determined to have nothing to do with the affairs of Central America though it regrettedthe attack that had been made on Nicaragua, by which the property o£ Englishl subjects had been sacrificed. All the Goverment had done was to send to the coast a naval force, just sufficient to afford due protection to British subjects and their property. The agent for Costa Rica then stated that the Government of that State intended to resist the aggression of WAlKER, but that it had no arms ; the agent, havingno credit in this country, could not himself purchase them; he therefore asked whether the War Department could not furnish him with a supply. The answer of the War Department was contained in the letter the Earl of Ear,ls- had read; that offer was not accepted; so, even indirectly, there had been no interference with the affair of CostsaRica. Since WAlxaii took possession of Nicaragua, he had seized a good dealof British property by the form of forced loans; therehadbeen some communication on the subject with the United States Government, and from a despateh from Mr. CrA'rrxON, dated the 15th of March, it appearedthat that Government regretted the state of things in Nicaragua, and was as anxious as the British Government to see WAtaxu rooted out; and the Earl of CLARNDoN thought there could be no better mode of effecting this than that the Amnerican and British Governments should combine for the purpose. The. Earl of MBXrTxsnURY asked if it was true the Circassians had made a representation to the PorTE, in which they called on the allies to protect their independence, and whether the Earl of CLARNDON could lay the document on the table ? The Earl of CLANDoxN said it was quite true a deputation of Circassians-had made such a representation to the Turkish Government, but the English Government had not received any document, except a letter from some Circassian chiefs to the Qu=f. The spokesman of this deputation was an individual who was not a Circassian at all, and who duming the war had shown himself anything but friendly to the alhes. The Earl of Anssr irAn moved the reappointment of the Select Committee on the Government of our Indian Territories. The former committee, the labours of which were interrupted in 1853, had not directed its inquiries to the internal administration of India; he stated the chief points in which that administration is defective and requires investigation,-the finances, the public works, the paucity of judicial oficers, and the practice of torture. He hoped the committee would be reappointed, and that it would commence where the committee of 1853 terminated. Earl GRhAvmTx thought the necespity for reappointing the committee had not been provred; the governmenat of India must be carried on in India itself. XIe hoped. the motion wvould not be pressed. The Earl of ErLLxoxouGH agreed with Earl G 1N-vmvs that it would not be advisableto reappoint the committee if its object was to promote organlic changes, for which the time had not arnived. But, in refusingr to reappoint it, it should be understood that the Rfouse did not declare against all inquiry into the internal administration of the Indian Government. There was much in the finances alone that justified some inquiry. The Marquis of CLANRIcARDE concurred with the Earl of EiawrnsoxouGn as to the necessity of improving the management of the finances of India. The motion was negatived without a division. The Marriage Law Amendment Bill went through committee, Lord BnonOUG A having withdrawn the two clauses most objected to, those relating to legitimacy and divorce. The House then adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to MIr. OTWAY, Lord PAMErtsmON explained the reasons why the band-playing in Kensington-gardens and the Parl;s on Sundays had been discontinued. The prohibition, he added, would only apply to the metropolis. The House having resolved itself into a Committee of Ways and Means, The CN&EIcuoR of the EXCHEQuIER made his financial statement. He reminded the committee that in a statement made in February he had said that there was a difference between his estimates of the revenue and expenditure last year and their actual amount; it was not necessary, therefore, to repeat that statement, and he should contenthimself, he said, with stating that the receipts were somewhat less, and the expenditure was somewhat greater, than he had anticipated, and that the result was a deficiency of 3,560,0001. To cover that deficiency he had submitted a resolution for a loan of 5,000,0001. in Consols, andalso a propositionforfunding 3,000,0001. of Exchequer-bills, which had taken effect, and had been successful for its object. Since then the balance-sheet for the financial year 185556 had been laid before Parliament, and the House had seen the result, which he thought it unnecessary to repeat. The expenditure in the past year, 1855-56, had been 88,428,0001., the revenue 65,705,000., showing an excess of expenditure over revenue of 22,723,0001., or, with the addition of certain other items, the Sardinian loan and the redemption of hereditary pensions, a total excess of 23,936,0001. To cever this excess there had been raised by loan, Exchequer-bonds and bills, 26,478,0001., exceeding the deficiency by 2,542,0001., and it was his duty to account for this sum, and to show how the Exchequer had been benefited thereby. The balances in the Exchequer on the 31st of 3March, 1856, exceeded their amount on the 31st of March, 1855, by 2,651,0001., showing a balance in favour of the Exchequer of more than 100,0001. The expenditure of the year which had elapsed hadbeen mainly characterized by its connexion with the war, the civil expenditure having been but slightly augmented. The total expenditure in the two years of war, 1854-55 and 1855-56, was 155,120,0001.; the total amount in two years of peace, 1852-53 and 1853-54, had been 102,032,000., eing adifference of 53,088,0001. The revenue in the two years of -war was 125,200,0001., and in the two years of peace 108,018,0001., an increase of revenue from taxation in the two years of war of 17,182,0001. The amount raised by an addition to the funded and unfunded debt was 33,604,0001.: so that the total receipts in the two - years of war amounted to 50,786,0001., as compared with two years of peace. Adding the surplus incomo in two years of peace, the amount applicable to war expenditure over and above the um mappliedto peace expenditure was 56,772,0001.; and adding. for the war expenditure of 1856-7 24,500,0001.; the total excesswa 77,588,0001. Having stated theseparticulars, he observed that, although peace had been concluded, yet, for practical purposes, the present year must be considered as a year of war. Prepa-. rations had been making for operations by sea and land during the winter and the early part of this year; large contracts had been entered into, which were payable this year, as well as the cost of the re-transport of the Sardinian troops from the Orimea. Nevertheless, he rejoiced to say that the Government had been able to make considerable redluctions in the estimates for the army and navy, the original estimates having amounted to 54,874,0001., and the revised estimates being 37,315,0001.-a difference of 17,559,0001. Besides the expenditure immediately connected with the war, there was a char-ge arisinU from the convention with Sardinia; and he stated the circumstances under. which he Droposed to the House to authorize the Government to advance a second million for paying the expenses of the Sardinian army. The estimated total expenditure for the current year 1856-7, including the loain to Sardinjit, was 75,525,000I., which woulc cover the- entire egimated services for the year; but, as it was difficult to make accurate estimates as to various items of expenditure, he proposed, by way of prudent precaution, to take, as a margin, a vote of credit for 2,00,0001., which wouldnmake atotal of 77,525,0007. After entering into detailed explanations respecting, the income-tax and the Customs duties upon tea, xugsr, coffee, spirits, and malt, he stated the total net amount of the revenue, as estiQined, at 67,152,0001.;. deducting this sum from the amoun-t of estimated expenditure, there appeared an estimated deficiency of 10,373,0001., wiich the remaincder of the produce of the loan of Last year, 1,500,007., would reduce to 8,873,0001. Looldng to the condition of the couatry and to the difficulty, or improbability, of* immediately realizing this amount by additional taxation the Government did not feel justified, he said, in proposing any additional taxes, nor did they recommend any reduction. They proposed to make no change in the existing basis of the taxation, but to resort to borrowing, and they had, in the first instance, invited tenders for a loan of 5,000,0001., and their terms, which had been accepted by the contractors, he should submit in the form of a resolution to the Committee. Re had the authority of Baron RomTSCHILD for atating that the deposits already amounted to 4,0G0,0001. in Banlk of England notes and gold, which, at the rate of 10 per cent., represented a capital, ready to be advanced, of 40,00,000o. He trusted that the Committee would be of opinion that this loan had been effected upon terms fair to both the parties and the Government. The loan would not, however, cover the entire estimated deficiency by 1,873,0007., to provide for which he proposed, at a later period of the session, to ask for power to borrow, in Exchequer-bonds, if it should be advisable, to the extent of 2,000,0001. The present state of the Exchequer-bill market did not render it advisable to increase the amount of the unfunded debt. At the same time, he believed the fall in the value of those securities had been occasioned by temporary circumstances. The quantity of outstanding Exchequer-bills in the market amounted to 20,124,0007., of which sum the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt held 5,000,000. ; so that the amount really in the market was no more than 15,124,0007L Comparing the amount of the debt at the end of the last war and at the present time, he showed that the funded debt had decreased 49,000,0001. Rad the ulfunded debt 17,000,0007., the total diminution being 66,000,0001., whilethe charge for the debt had 'diminished 4,500,0007. Ravingread a statement of aecruingliabilities on the one hand, and on the other an account of the annuities and pensions that would cease or fall in in the course of a few years, hejuatified the borrowing in Oonsols instead of terinuable annuities,maintaining thatperpetual annuities were a form of borrowing most convenient forboth borrower and lender. An impression existed, he observed, in some quarters, that the moment of a transition from warto peace was a favourable one for revising our system of taxation. Our Customse tariff had, however, been revised by Sir R. Pxza, and the only duties of a protective kind which now existed were those on foreign spirits and on malt. The stamp duties and assessed taxes had been revised, and the whole revenue of the Excise had been constantly under the consideration of the House. The expenditure of this country, within thie control of Parliament (excluding the public debt), calculated per head, was not, as he showed, unreasonable, compared with that of other countries. Re mloved, in conclusion, a sories of resolutions sanctioning and giving effect to the loan. After some remarks by hlr. ALcoCe and Mr. HA:sFrFmr on the subject of fire-insurances; from Mr. W. WILms respecting the stock in which the loan was contracted; from Mr. E. BxAL, on the malt-tax; from Mr. VAxcE, on the duty npon Irish spirits; and from Mr. M. GmEsox, in favour of a repeal of the duty upon paper, M1r. DisRAx, after expressing his gratification at receiving an assurance from the highest authority that the resources of the country were unimpaired, said he hoped, when the excitement of the war had passed away, that the House would give its attention to a most rigid system of economy, and not allow itself to suppose that it could guard against a repetition of the circumstances which had occurred&at the beginning of the war by maintaining a much larger military establishment. Re then adverted to the relations between this country and Sardinia, observing that, judging from the protocols of the negotiations laid before the Rouse, he should suppose that there had been an understanding between the Sardinian Ministry and the British Government respecting the liberation of Italy; but how, he asked, was he to reconcile such language and diplomatic documents with a tripartite treaty between England, France, and Austria, coisolidating and sealing a policy opposed to that which Sardinia had adopted and Great Britain encouraged ? Lord PFAr=nsroN said the surmises of 3Mr. DisrAuR.r were entirely destitute of foundation. There was no mystery in our relations with Sardinia; they were known to everybody, and appeared upon the face of the protocols and the treaty; they were the relations of perfect confidence and friendship and of intimate alliance; but as to any secret project of revolutionizing Italy, there was not the slightest ground from which any man could pimly such an imputation. The treaty with Aistria was for one purpose, and for one only-namely, that there should be a mutual engagement between England, France, and Austria, to provide for the, due execution of the treaty for securing the independence of the Turkish empire, but not binding England and I France .to guarantee the possessions of Austria. Sir F. BAmG, recalling the discussion to the subject of finance, said he thought the CH2N-CELLOn of the ExcHicux: had taken the wisest course in the present state of things, but hoped that next year there would be a reduction of the estimates, for which otherwise the country would loudly calL. Mr. GLADsToNE thought that MIr. DIsRitxA WAS justified in referring to Sardinia, which he did not believe to be intent upon schemes of aggressiori. Her function, he observed, was to exhibit a bright example to Italy, and, as a consequence of that example, she was most certain to find her reward. With regard to the principle ulpon which our military expenditure ought to be regulated, there was, he said, a vague opinion in the countr thatthe Rouse of Commons was the cause of the evils shich had happened at the commencement ot the war; blit he denied that anyconnexion couldbe traced between the alleged cause and effect. He commended the CHANCELLOR of the ExcHxqma?, who, he thought, had sailed very near the wind in his estimates, for not proposing to remit taxes, and trusted hevwould hold finn and decided language as to the intention of the Govermment to maintain the existing taxation until they were in a condition to_ propose the remining reforms neowsary to bring our taxation into a satisfactoxy state. After some further discuion, The CHAwcyr,rop. of the ExcxQvEn made a short replyto objections, in the couse of which he statod that the 5,000,0001. Exchequer-bills held by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the Watiaui3 Debt represented savings-banks' money. The resolutions were then agreed to. On the order for going into committee upon the Fire Inurances Bill a discussion of some length arose, and the House divided upon the question that the committee be deferred for six months, which was negatived by 172 to 31, and the Rouse went into committee upon the bill, the clauses of which underwent much discussion. Certain other bills were advanced a stage, and, after some other business, the Rouse was counte< out at a quarter to 1 o'clock.
The CnAicELor of the ExnRumie's financial statement, notwithstanding the enormous figures andl the grave events with which it deals, will be read with great pleasure. The Budget is au annual affair, and everybody who wishes to verify the auticipations of one year can do so by waiting for the financial retrospect of the next. A statesman must indeed be bold who can promise a balance which, twelve months -hence will be a glaring deficiency; and so, presuming that no man is so careless of his reputation, the most sceptical are disposed to believe a financier thus pledged to truth. The OH"CELLon of the ExcHEQnu promises a saving of 17,559,0001. by-the revision of the Army and Navy Estimates for the current year. -What he promises he doubtless believes, and- what "he believes we are bound to receive wii miuch respect, Of course, he has to take the figures ODL
Among the Parliamentary annuals Mr. BznxEx.nY's motion for the Ballot holds a distinguished place. 2Not even Maynooth offers so large a field for indignant declamation. The scandal of electioneeriiig tactics, the secret histories of Norwich and. Liverpool, intimidation in counties, exclusive dealing in boroughs, party virulence and quarrels among neighbours who are always friends except at election time, are subjects on which a speaker can always find something to say which shall fill up the two hoius which the importance of the occasion demands. As the Blaynooth motion is a kind of safety-valve to the Protestant feeling of constituencies, and is looked upon by a clasm of members as a useful opportmlity for giving a popular vote which will come to nothing, so Mr. BEnsELra's motion gives liberal representatives the power of harmlessly redeeming one of the commonplace pledges which are a formality of the hustings in our large towns. It is quite possible, therefore, that the Ballot will to-night again receive the sanction of the House of Commons. Leave may be given to Mr. BERKELEY to bring in a bill, which will be duly brought in by him and two or three of his friends, and then as duly devoted to oblivion. What, then, is to be said on the question that has not been said during a score of sessions, we cannot tell. Certainly nothing new has been revealed on the subject since lay 22, 1855, when, in the crisis of the Sebastopol campaign, Mr. IBsxiZY, deprecating exclusive attention to the war, cited all the disreputable stories that are extant regarding bribery, treating, and their kindred scandals, and - asked the House to sanction his plan for secret voting. The two evils which, in the judgment of its supporters, the Ballot is to cure are-the a* cratic constitution of the House of Commons and the personal demoralization of the constituents themselves. Now, with regard to the first, it seems to us thaC the Ballot can only form part of a larger scheme. For nearly a quarter of a century a reformed Parliament has been in existence. That it has done good service to the country none but the members of an inconsiderable faction will deny. No grievance is felt throughout the land without receiving the attention of the House in discussions which are only too long. It cannot be said tnat any Englishman of fair abilities and reputation-has much difficulty in obtaining a seat among the representatives of his country. Therefore, both as regards the public weal and thejust ambition of individuals, the House of Commons is a popular body. Anomalies which the most simple can point out, faults which the most subtle cannot defend, exist in the constitution and working of the machine, and when these vices produce an effect palpably injurious to the public service the voice of the nation will, no doubt, call for a remedy. But at present there is silence. So far from the public demanding another Reform Bill, there never was a time when organic change in the constitution of the Housewas lessdebated on the platform orinthepress. A few weeks since the House adjourned for want of a quorum when the motion for Parliamentary Reform was to come on, and, so far from members being viited with the indignation of their constituents, the apathy of Manchester and Birningham gave an implied approbation to what had been done. The Ballot must be considered as one of the points of a Reform Bill, as it is, indeed, declared to be by its most earnest and constant advocates-the Chartists. To treat it as a separate question demanding an immediate decision is warranted neither by its own importance nor by any predilection on the part of the public. For it cannot be denied that of all the schemes of Reformers this is the one which is least generally assented to by the people in general. The argument of its advocates, that the open voting demoralizes the constituencies, is not admitted by the constituencies themselves. The great majority of the electors vote not only without reserve, but with an openly avowed confidence and pride in their opinions. Both before and after the poll, each manwears the colours of his party, aids its schemes, repeats its cries, its platitudes, and its claptraps. If the voters are morally lowering themselves, it is at least willingly, with their eyes open, and in accordance with habits which become a tradition among them. To take an open part in the borough election is as natural for the ten-pound householder as to interest himself in parish or municipalaffairs, and we cannot think that any enactment which should seek to change this second nature would have the slightest effect. It is impossible to doubt the force of the objection that under the Ballot nine-tenths of the electors would openly proclaim which side they had supported, and that a few days after the election almost every man7s vote would be accurately known. In fact, it is impossible to eradicate what is ingrained in the political life of the country. Open voting is, for good or evil, the mode by which Englishmen express their opinions on public affairs or men, and to cite the exiamples of other ages and countries is simply to forget the fact that people make their institutions rather than are made by them. WVe wish, indeed, that such simple machinery as a box with variously coloured balls could restore purity to the elective system of England, give an unfailing succession of able statesmen to the country, destroy the tyranny or the enticements of wealth, and procure for merit its just position in the State. But these are benefits not to be obtained by any summary legislation; they are the fruit of time, of patience, of unceasing watchfulness on the part of the public. We have during the present generation made great advances, and we trust that the evils which still exist will lessen year by year; but for the elevation of the voter we must trust to the spread of education and sound principles rather than to any legislative enactment.

It has been determined that Lord GRANVILLE, the President of the Council, shall proceed upon an extraordinary mission to St. Petersburg on the occasion of the Emperor of RussIA's coronation. The choice is one which will meet with universal approval. In the first place, it seemed desirable that some statesman high in office should be selected for the mission, but yet it was difficult to withdraw from his official duties any high functionary absolutely engaged in the conduct of a department. Now, the President of the Council is an officer who can be spared as soon as the Parliamentary Session is over, and who yet fully understands the feelings and views of the Cabinet. There is nothing known to Lords PAT, MIERSTON and CLAitm-ox which is unknown to Lord GA-vinx-a nobleman who, from his official position and personal character, necessarily enjoys the entire confidence of his colleagues. It is a greater compliment to the Emperor of RussiA that such a person should be selected for the mission of congratulation. Now that the war is at an end, we imay be permitted to say that the Emperor ALEXANDEP well deserves such a mark of respect from any of his late opponents. It was not he who brought on the war. He received the fatal legacy of strife from the dying hand of his ambitious father. Since his accession to the throne he has done all that lay in his power to restore peace to the 'world. As far as we may judge of his intentions by his declarations and acts, he appears resolved to turn the minds of his subjects to those more peaceful pursuits on which the prosperityand happiness of the Russian nation undoubtedly depend. Itshould,then, be our pride, as it is our duty, to hold out the right hand of fellowship to the young SovzmGro. The difficulties with which he wil be surrounded at home will be quite sufficient to tax his energies to the utmost ;-the least that foreign nations can do is to convey to him hearty assurances of amity and goodwill so long as he adheres to the policy of peace. This seems to be the view which the British Government has taken of the transaction, and therefore a man of such note as Lord GAxv-rNv has been selected to convey the compliments of the nation to the young EMPEROR on his accession to the throne of the Russias. We, who were lately urging on hostile preparations against him, very sincerely bid him " GOD speed" at the outset of his momentous undertaking. Let the Emperor AnDsXAND forget the evil traditions of the past, and be very sure that the happiness of his own people is inextricably bound up with the happine3s of all other European nations. There are certain private considerations besides which mark the selection of Lord GBAwvars for this pleasant office with the stamp of peculiar fitness. The father of the present PLresident of the Council was for a considerable time the representative of this country at St. Petersburg; and hence have arisen amicable relations and intimacies, which will have a great tendency to smooth tlle path of the half-courtier, half-diplomatist, who is charged with the first message of peace and goodwill at the conclusion of a most furious contest. There is, however, one point on which we would lay particular stress. This appointment of Lord G&NaviEn does not in any manner whatever affect the mision of Iord WoDnrousE to St. Petersburg. He is not there to prepare the way for the regular Ambassador; but purely, as his denomina. tion will imply, upon an errand of Sigh cointvs an4 respeot to the young Emperor, 'Uon this occasion it 3might be wise to revise the ancient practice with regard to such missions. We believe it has hitherto [been the custom that the Ambassador Extraordinary, or by whatever more formal name he may be known, should himself undertake a large portion of the expense of his mission. Now, such a custom seems derogatory in the highest degree to the dignity oi the nation. It comes to this, that Lord Gx.avnr,-not the English people-will have to. pay the compliment to the Emperor ALEXANDER. We will venture to say that there is not a Financial Reformer in the House of Commons who would not reject such a conclusion with the utmost disdain and aversioA. lhe English people are rich enough to defray all public services well, and to pay with generous hand any person whom they may employ on affairs of State. The idea that any nobleman or gentleman is to be taxed out of his private means to a heavy amount because he iB the fittest person to render a particular service to the nation is quite at variance with all our ideas of public morality or dignity. That service which is paid for is the only service worth having has lonTg been a maxim among men of business, and it applies to embassies as well as to other affairs. We shall be glad to hear the proper Minister propose a vote to the House of Commons for such a sum as will defray the expenses of Lord GBAvi}'s mission with a splendour creditable to the nation. There can be no doubt that such a vote will be agreed to on the instant, without contradiction from any side.

UNIY.IRSITY INTI_LIGENCE. AYWAPTh IrT. in The vacant scholarshiosat Trinity College were this day awarded to Mr. James Leo Warner, of University College; lMr. Edmondes, from Sherborne school; and Mr. E. C. Boyle, from Marlborough. Mr. Waner was educated at Ru,by school. The Junior Proctor has given notice that he will receive the names of those undergraduates who wish to offer them. selves for responsions during the current term, on Saturday, the 24th inst., from 12 tiUl 2 o'clock, and on Monday, the 26th inst., from 1 till 3.
TRn= MONDAY.-Yesterday, being Trinity fonday, a special general court was held at the Trinity Rouse, on Tower-hill, at which his Royal Highness Prince Albert was unanimously re-elected Master, and Captain Jobn Shepherd Deputy-31asterof that ancientcorporation [ forthe ensuing year. The Courc then proceeded to the parish church of St. Olave, Hart-street, where divine ser- ice was performed, and an excellent and appropriate sermon preached by the Rtev. Arthur P. Stanley, MI.A^. ILAsTER DEPARTuE oF MAiLS FOr THE M mITERRANEAN, INDLX, &c., VIA MARsEmLEs.-The overland mails for the Mediterranean, India, &c., rid Marseilles, will in future be made up and despatched from London on the evenings of the 10th and 26th of each month, instead of on the mornings of those days, as heretofore, except when the 10th or 26th of themonth falls on a Sunday, on which occasion the mails will be despatched from London on the morning of the following day. THE MURDERERS oF MIss HxyDs.-The execution of Dunne and Murphy took placo on Friday, and, although there was a large assemblage of persons to witness it, there was not anything lik-e the crowds that usually congregate on such occasions. Shortly before 12 o'clock the troops and constabulary took up the different positions allotted to tbem, and a very formidable appearance they presented. One o'clock was the hour appointed for the execution, and immediately after that time James Murphy was brought out, attended by two clergymen. He appeared fervent, in prayer; and, on its being announced tLat allwas ready, the fatal bolt was drawn and he was launched into eternity. He died almost without a struggle, the only thing observable being a cLtqvering of the limbs. After hangingforabout half anhourhisbody wasloweredandplaced in a coffin, to be interred within the precincts of the gaol. Cavan scaffold admits of only one execution taking place at a time; therefore, shortly after Murphy'sbody was removed, Dunne was brought from his cell, attended by four priests, and he too was earnest in prayer and most attentive to his religious duties. When it was intimated that he was ready he walked out on thedropwith a firm steDp and theboltbeing drawn hetoowentinto thepresence of his Makerwith scarcely any appearance of bodily suffering. When he had been suspended the usual time his remains were put in a coffin, and shortly afterwards delivered to his sister, immediately upon whEich the crowd dispersed in the mo$tpeaceable and orderly manner. Tlhus ended the earthly career of these two wretehed men cut off in the prime of life for one of the most diabolicai murders ever committed in thins country. It is a well-known fact that until Murphy was induced to join the Riband lodge in this locality no better conducted or more industrious young man could be foun. DREADFulx FE AT WYEST DEEriNG.-On Friday morning last$a fire broke outonthe premises of Mr. Greaves at West Deeping. It appears that on the morning of the day in question, at about 4 o'clock, Mr. Greaves's wife awoke him, the room being ful of smoke. He immediately got up> and ran out. A djoining his house is a watermill, winch he found was in flames. Greaves then ran round to the millhead to arouse two millers who were sleeping there, and, having put a ladder over the water, with a shorter one he broke in the casement. Greaves then looked in and he be. lieved he saw the two men sinking from suffocation. The mill was soon after enveloped in flames, which were rapidly extending themselves tothe house. A short time afterwards afarmernamed JosephMorley, inlookingthroughthewindow at the bottom of the mill, saw, hanging from the rafters, the body of one of the men graduallyburning away; the bodies eventually dropped on the ground floor, and thence into the water. When taken out they presented a horriblo appearance, the heads being nearly burnt from the bodies, and nothing ,more than the trunks left. An inquest was held on Saturday evening before Mr. W. Edwards, coroner, at the Red Lion inn, on the bodies of the two men, named Wright and WiUoughby, when a verdict of " AccidentaUy burnt to death" was recorded. On the previous evening Mr. Greaves passed the miU at about 12 o'clock, and he then told the miler to go to bed at 2. To all appearance alI was then safe. A watch was found in the water at the millhead, which had stopped at half-past S o'lock. This was the property of one of the milers. The miU and adjoining premises werethe property of Mr. J. A. Allen, of Toft, and were insured forS l. The only copjectureas to the origin of the fireis that the miller, having put In sufficient corn to last until2 o'clock, m-ay have gone to sleep, thinkmzg to awake in time to stop the mill, but not doing so the friction of the stones caused the framework to ignite, and thus the fire arose. TEE EsMANuENT OF THE TH&IES AND CHELSEABurDGE.-A copy of reports on the progress of works inthe Thames embankment, Chelsea-bridge, the new street from Lower Sloane-street to Chelsea-bridge, and Battersea Park, presented to the Board of Works by Mr. Pa e and Mr. -ennethorme, was published yesterday. A full history is given of the Chelsea embankment in the first of these re-. ports, whence it. appears that this year Mr. Jackson has constructed 200 feet of river wall, and a length of 280 feet of wall at the Grosvenor Canal entrance, and that thus there have been completed of the river wall of the embankment 4,966 feet, besides 984 feet of wall to docks, leaving a length of 1.502 feet to be executed to complete the embankment to the westendof theChelseaCollege property. The waUs of the GrosvenorCanal entrance are now nearly high enough for the formation of the bridge, and the embankment will then boe pushed forward so as to complete the communication between Vauxhall-bridge aud the Chelsea-bridge, and the new street now being formed through the Ranelagh Property of Mr. Brett. It is calculated that .32,500. wifl be required for completing the works to the west-end of theChelsca College property, and 28.5001. for the embankment thence to the west end of. Cheyne-walk. An interestirng account is given of the construction of the new Chelsea-bridge, the piers and roadway of which are of iron; its length is 922 feet (18 feet longer than Londonbridge), the width between the para ets 45 feet, and the area of roadway and footpath 41,490 feet. The cost of the bridge (including appoaches) will be 88,0001., or less by 10,7601. than the Hungerford Suspension-bridge. The piers of the bridge have been constructed in apeculiar manner, and without cofferdams. The bridge is now 47 feet between the railings, including the chains; it contains 4,610 superficial feet more than the original design, and is one-ninth larger than that structure. The works of new BatterseaPar- (excepting the liver embankment) are so far advanced that they may be completed within 18 monti if tewalks and plantations are to be formed upon the F present level, otherwisethey wil be spread oversomeycers It would neither be practicable nor necessary to raise the level of the park generally, but it is proposed to tro mounds and to construct the walks on a level now%ee less than two feet below Trinity datum. 16 acres of oraamental water Wll be also fermed. The total area of the park will ho 34b acres. The expenditure up to the 31st of March last, has been 281,068h., and the outlay willM ventuaUy amount to about 336,0681., of which 200,=1Ol..has been borrowed from the Exchequer-hDll Loan Commisioners, on [the security of the 125 acres of building la dround the park. The opening of Chelea-bridge wi bring this locality nea 1ly within two miles of Charing-oross; t150 soil is a fine sanS±y gravel, and there is every reason to, expect that the 'pXace will become attractive. The pul}jic sewer or open ditch whichnostraverses thewholelensh of the south sideof the park is denounced, in. the report hefore ns, as a great public nuisance and a treat drawbek an4 hindrance tnthe I njoyinint of thc park,
THE NEW MIJTAJBY HOSPITAL ON THE SOLENT. SOUTHAPTON, 3L&Y 19. Whatever may have been the result of the late war in a political point of view, there is no doubt that one great advantage to be derived from the experience gained by it will be the 'mprovement. which must be introduced into theadministration of the army, arisingfrom the insight which has been afforded into the defective worldng of many of our mnilitary instittions, exhibiting the absolute nadequacy of the barraclk and hospital establishments of the country to support the pressure upon them while in a state of war, or for maintaining a due efficiency in time of pease. Her Majesty has constantly shown the kindest solicitude for the wounded and invalids who, -after braving the horrors of war, pestilence, and mismanagement, have landed on their native shores with mutilated limbs, shattered health, and broken constitutions. Accordingly, we find that the first public act of Her-Majesty after the official conclusion of peace, tending to inaugurate what is to be hoped will be a new era in the improved administration of our military forces, is the ceremony which she has to-day accomplished in the laying of the foundation stone of a new military hospital near Southampton, which, from its magnitude, situation, and appliances, will, it is expected, be the first of its class in Europe. The site of this gigantic establishment has been admirably chosen. It is distant only six miles from Southampton and about 12 from Portsmouth. It is within five miles of the Botley and Southampton stations of the South-Westem Railway, and thus is brought into direct communication not only with the metropolis, but with the camp at Aldershott, and with the great naval and military station of Portsmouth. The land purchased by the Government for this object consists of 100 acres. The situation, besides being surrounded with exquisite scenery, is undeniably healthy. The building itself will be of immense magnitude; the frontage alone (facing south-west) will extend upwards of 1,400 feet. The main block is to consist of a centre and two wings, each three stories high. The centre it is intended to appropriate as a hospital for sick and invalided officers, the two wings for soldiers, the whole having accommodation for 1,000 patients, divided into wards of various sizes. The base. ment will be devoted to the use of inferior officers and servants of the establishment. Another part of the establishment, but quite distinct from the hospital, will be appropriated as barracks for convalescents, which will be constructed to accommodate 1,000 men, while a museum and anatomical theatre will be erected in a convenient part of the building. Detached will be a lunatic asylum and chapels for both Protestants and Catholics; A jetty has been thrown out into the Southampton Water a distance of 1,000 feet, on which a tram-road is laid for facilitating the landing of troons, and the trans-: mission of supplies. Alongside there is a depth of 10 feet of water. In the rear new roads are being formed leading to Botley, Gosport, Southampton, &c. The buildings will be supplied with soft water of excellent quality from Scholingcommon, distant about two miles, where works are now being erected to raise it. The whole pile of building is expected to be completed in about three years, and the cost, it is understood, will be about 200,0001. The ceremony of laying the first stone of this magnificent pile of buildings was of the most imposing kind. The arrangements for the accommodation of the Royal visitors were in every respect perfect. The jetty was decorated by an archway of evergreens, surmounted by a crown. The entire length was covered with scarlet cloth, and at the land end was a roomy platform for the presentation of the address from the 'Mayor and corporation of Southampton. The ground was entirely lined with detachments of military, which reached from the jetty, about a quaiter of a mile, to the spot at which the ceremony took place. The troops, all of whom were under the command of Colonel Barlow, consisted of 400 men 'of the 22d Regiment, 600 of the 7th ad25tsUeer4'-id1O oich of th 'regiments of Staffordshire, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Surrey, and Armagh MIilitia. The county police, under Captain Harris, were also on the ground to preserve order. At the end of a covered pathway, also tastefully decorated with choice plants, &c., leading from the spot at which hung thefoundation stone, two tents were erected, the one forming a reception and refreshment tent for the Royal family and suite, and the other a retiring roora for Her Majesty. These were most elegantly furnished and ornamented with plants of various descriptions, together with bonquets composed of the choicest flowers. A large tent for the recep. tion of the troops after the ceremony was also erected towards the back of the whole, in which was prepared a substantial dinner of roast beef, plumpudding, and ale. A dWjcader for the offlicer of the various regiments was also provided. A grand stand for the accommodation of visitors, of some magnitude, was quite filled with spectators. At a few minutes after ll o'clock the guns of Her Majesty's ship Arrogant, bearing the flag of Sir W. Seymour which was moored a short distance from the landing-place' made known that the Royal standard had appeared in sight Shortly after the Royal yacht Fairy, Captain Crispin, accompanied by the Elfin, Master-Co mmanding Balliston. brought up off the jetty. After some little delay, caused by the boisterous state of the weather, Her Majesty landed, accompanied by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, the Prince of Wales, and attended by the Duchess of Wellington ind the Hon. Mfary Seymour, and, under a salute from the guns of the Arrogant and the squadron of gunboats which had by this time anchored off the shore, Her Majesty walked along the jetty to the platform, where, after Lord Panmure ' bad presented the ex-Mayor of Southampton, Mr. J. T- Tucker (who officiated in consequence of the illness of Mr. l Sampson Payne, the present Mayor) to Her Majesty, the address was read in a very clear and impressive manner by the Town Clerk, Mr. C. Deacon, and afterwards preseuted by Mr. Tucker. On receiving the document Her Majesty replied,-" I thank you for your loyal address, and receive with much satisfaction your assurance of attachment to myself and sympathy in the welfare of my brave soldiers, and accept the deep interest evinced by the corporation of Southampton in this day's proceedings as a tok-en of their determination to forward as far as is in their power this national work." Her Majesty then proceeded, amid the most enthusiastic cheers, to the spot selected for laying the foundation stone, in the performance of which the programme as published in llic Times of this day (Mtonday) was druly observed. Duing the ceremony there were among those in attendance on Her Majesty Lord Panmure, Sir George Grey, Sir George Seymour, Sir John Burgoyne, General Breton and staff, Colonel Foster, Commanding Royal Engineers of the South-West District; Colonel Beaulieu, Major Ravenhill, R.E., Captain Wrottesley, &c. The Bishop of Winchester and most of the clergy of the diocess were also present. The stone bore the following inscription " This stone was laid on the 19th dayof May, in the year of our Lord 1856, by Her Most Gracious Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, to be the foundation atone of a military hospital for the reception of the sick and wounded soldiers of her army." The trowel, which was elegantly chased, also bore an appropriate inscription. After the ceremony the Queen retired to the marquee erected for her reception, and, after passing through the tent in which a substantial dinner for the troops was provided, returned at once on board the Royal yacht, and immediately left for Osborne, the zuns firing a Royal salute, and the men of the Arrogant again manning yards. The Mayor and corporation of Southampton, who had senzred for themselves the steamboat Medina, followed srtly after Her Majesty, and, after proceeding some short distance down the river, partook of a grand banquet on board, and raturned in the afternoon. A display of - fireworks took place on the water in the evening. The wather, although squally in the morning, became beautiPully fine. The battery of the Southampton platform. saluted ler Majesty both upon her arrivaland departure. After the ceremony had concluded. Lord PanmutLie, accompanied by other gentlemen, left for Southampton, when his Lordship inspected the Ordnanoe Su1rveying Department in this town. We must not omit to state that Mr.. J !. Tucker, ex Mfayor, at the request of Her Majesty, h1d. the honour of an audience. The following veseid were, in additionto the Royal yachts Fairy and Elfin, ir attendance on Her ajesty, viz.. -Royal yacht ViotoTi and Albert, Captain the Hon.

CosT oF Tx WAR.-At the worst this extraordinary war wvill have been brought to a conclusion by the creaTion of only 40,440,0001. new debt, funded and tanfunded.! In the same period of time, 1795 to 1797, Hr. Pitt raised loans to the amount of 144,000,0001., and in the years succeeding 1798 to 1801 to the amount of 148,000,0001. But when we say that public debt has be6n created since the beginning of 1854 to the amount of 40,440,0001., we must observe that that statement is subject to considerable modifications. By a reference to the fnance accounts of 1854, it will be seen that in the first six 7Asonths of that year Bank Annuities and South Sea Stock were paid off in cash, under the Conversion Act of 1853, to the extent of 8,0M8,505l., and which so exhausted the balances in the Exchequer in April, 1854, as well as anticipating a portion of the revenue of the following quarter, that the immediate issue of the Exchequer-bonds in the above list became urgent. When, therefore, we speak of the debt created since the 1st of January, 1854, we must deduct from the amount that of the public debt redeemed during the sametime, for the debt incurred in the interim has been required not alone for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the war, but also in order to restore the balances .'n the Exchequer to their present satisfactory condition. The account, then, stated with this 'deduction, will staid thus *. neb, funded and unfunded. created since Jan. 1. 1854 £40410,006 Deduct debt redeemed in 185t .. ... *- .. 8,068,505 Sotht helance of niew debt.. .. , .ze1j7t9 So that the. public debt of this country, including the 5,0,0.loan about to be contracte for, and; the 2,000,0001. of, Exhequer-bills hereafter to be issued, will have been increased by the *ar to an amount of only 32,371,4951. No fact could better show how ready the people have been to bear a large portion of the expendi. tare by increased burdens at the moment. But this souind principle of raising within the ear the supplies of the'year has been carried still further. Te great bulk of the war taxes have been so granted that they will continue for nexrly two years more, so that an abundance of ways and means will exist to redeeni the whole of the Exchequer'bonds faling due, as well - as some portion of the Exchequerbills issued for the war. The amount which the exiastimg taxes will thus redeem cnot be placed below 8,000,000W, which, when the war taxes shall be exhausted, will reduce the debt created for the war to 24,371,0001. Bult oven here the provision which Parliament has already made tor the reduction and' eirly redemption of that -debt does not stop. In the Loan Acts of 1855 and 1856 there. is a: provision, having aUlthe force of law, and which wril no doub' be included in the act for the further 5'000,000l., by which a chrge is made upon the Consolidated Fund to the extent of 1,500,0001. a-year for the redemption of the debt incurred for the wars. Taking the amount, then, as we 'have 'shown it WMill be when the war taxes have expired, at 24,371,000X., the whole sum will be liquidated in, 16 years 'under a provision of law which no Chancellor of the Exchequer will be able to evade. - So far, then, as . the -war has- affected the national debt, it- may be summed up in a few -words. Including alI the i ,extraordinary expenditure of the uresent year, there - will, since the beginning of 1854, lave-'been added to the debt 32,371,0001.; of this amount 8,000,00Q1. at lea of Exchequer-bills and bonds will be redeemable in-a-short period, and for which thero are already provided the' extra - war taxes to the full amount; so that -at the close of-the war expenditure and the expiring of the war tases the: balAnce of increased debt will be 24,371,00., for the pay- ' ment of which there exists a legal provision at. therate of. 1,50,0001. a-year, which will result in art entire-liquidation of the whole in 16 years, and this not dependent upon-thewill or ctprico of any Government of the day, but se,ured by an act of the Legislature,-Econo,misf.
. Oox our OWN, ORP PARIS, SuxD.y, M yS, 6 PrX. It is said that Russia has protested, or is soon to protest, against the treaty'of the 15th, as concluded and signed, without her participation or knowledge, by England, France, and Austria. I do not pretend to vouch for the correctness of the statement, but I have heard it in a quarter generally so well informed that I have little hesitation in mentioning it. It is also believed that inquiries have been made as to the rmnour that has circulated in various quarters] relative to a secrettreaty, and to which Ihavemore than once alluded. At all events, I fear there is reason to apprehend that the relations with Russia are not of the warm and confident Inda which were expected from the conclusion of the conferences. Private letters from Italy speek of the deep discontent which prevails everywhere, and to which some of the functionaries of certain Itahan Governments are not strangers.' In one State it is said that several officers of rank in the army are dissatisfied :with the actual state of things; and disbelief irn the possibility of its continuance is hardly concealed even by those who have no interest in a change. By some it is thought that the year *will not pass away without this discontent assuming a more marked and formidable appearance. The efforts of the allied Governments are said to be directed to calm, rather than to excite, the fermentation which exists throughout the whole peninsulawith what success remains to be seen. The Italian race, if the most brilliant, has certainly been one of the most ill-fated of which history makes mention. The fatal gift of beauty, to use the words of Filicaija, has been allotted to it; and to it no humanglory has been refused. 'When supposed to have lost the genius for government and for war it became the centre of lterature and the arts. Its influence, material or moral, has been felt all over the world; but, though she civilized and converted,' after having conquered it, Italy has not acquired polticalcohesion or political power. She has not even obtained the advantege possessed by a people she once despised, andhas never ceasedto hate. She hashad no confederationhike the States of Germany, nor even the apparent combination of ancient Greece. She has long been the aim of the ambitious and the prey of the aggressor, and has been despoiled in turn by Germany andFrance. Acountrywhich, in a united state, would form no inwvieldy possession, remains still divided into three secondary States-Piedmont, the States of the Church,and thekingdomof the Two Sicilies, and the smaller Principalities of Tuscany, Parma, and Modena,without counting the almost imiperceptible spots of San Iarino and Monaco, while not the least important in extent, the most fertile in natural products, and not the least rich in historical associations since the time of the Gauls, Loombardy and the State of Venice belong to the House of Hapsburg, and of the two islands peopled by an; Italian race one belongs to England and the other; to France. This want of cohesion for so long a period, inviting to aggression hasled to the conclusion among many even who are friends to Italy that Italian liberation and unity are but a dream, and the Italian race is utterly unfit for independence and self-government. Its instinctive and exquisite taste in all that relates' to the arts and literature is freely admitted, but its 'aptitude for govermment denied. This I believe to be one of those errors which confounld thre effect ancd the cause. It is not true that the Italian people are. unfit for government, and we have at this moment the best proof of the fact in the actual condition of Piedmont. The revolutionary movement of 1848, iwhich in the other countries to which it spread was simply destructive of good and bad alke, inPiedmont only overthrew the latter. Before that period Piedmont was under the influence of Austria, was in the hands of the Jesuits, was enslaved, and was ,wretchedly administered; but where is the country on the continent of Europe that occupies the position she does now, after passing through so many bitter trials? Is there one that would not have been thrown back for many a long year by the disastrous campaign which closed I on the field of Novara? It was not merely defeat in the field, but treason and ingratitude, that she had to contend against. The treaty of August, 1849, put an end to the war with Austria, and not merely was Piedmont forced to abandon all views on Lombardy, but her powerful and triumphant enemy exacted from her, exhausted as she was left by that defeat, an indemnity which the allies are generous or simple enough not to demand now from Russia.. Piedmont wvas bound in three millions sterling, onefifth of which had to be delivered within three 3months, and the remainder by instalments of nearly a quarter of a million sterling every two months. She faced the danger which was all but financial ruin without flinching. No chicaneryvwas resorted to, no undignified expostulations or complaints were heard from her. She stubmitted with heroic. resignation to the hard law of necessity. Her Government ratified provisionally the ruinous treaty of the 12th of Auguxst, and herParliament voted fands for the payment of the first instalment of the war tribute. The Chamber of Dleputies, it is true, at first presented some obstacles to the ratification of the treaty, as a whole; the Chamber was at once dissolved, and the young and gallant Sovereign appealed to his people for support. His people responded to the call, and the new Chamber, animated by a spirit of wisdom and of true patriotisma, redeemed the honour of its KRing. It voted in silence and sorrow, but stil it voted, for the maintenance of the treaty and of its consequences. It merely coupled its approval with a demand that the Minister should declare that no such compact existed anterior to August; that extradition should not be extended to political offences ; that Austrian vengeance should be baffled; and that the convention with Austria relative to contraband should not be renewed on its expiration. Whatever might be said of the polcy of that -war, it was noble in its object, for, had it been successfuil it would have been followed by the liberation of Italy. Such as it was, the struggle was catrie'd on by Piedmont without fear, and was terminated without dishonour. Even at a moment so terrible to the vanquished 1iedmont rejected the bribe offered by her conqueror, in the considerable reduction of the war indemnity, on condition of abolishing her constitutional regime, which was a standing menace to Austria. She rejectedthe bribe, she borethe heavy burden imposed by adversity, but at the same time she maintained inviolate her engagements to her enemyand to herown people. It must not be for. gotten that Piedmont was then new to coinstitutional government; that her misfortunes were -in gat part owing to the abuse of liberty; that her ng was just driven into exile and to death,; that a reaction had already sprung up all over Europe against the excesses of 1848; and that all this neither disgusted her with liberal ini- stitutions nor intimidated 'her. One advantage. she gcained; she issued, it is true, exhausted materially and morally from her unequal struggle with Auistria, but she gained with all' true patriots, -writh all the rational I,iberals of Italy, an influence wluch has ever since steadily increasedl, she has won the respect and admiration of all whose. respect and admiration are worth having, by her, perseverance, her courage, her moderation, and her 'wisdoni ; anduhe has now her reward in being looked up to as the last hope of Itaban independence. . IWe must not forget the conduct' of Venice during lher 1' months' independence of Austria, nor thb moderation of her 'Government, encompassed as they were by the horrors of pestilence and of *ar', and'hich e;torted-praise even from the mostb itter enemies of her-revolution. But the masterpassion of 'the .Italian isthe complete- liberation of his -country from.foreign doxriilnaton.. The failuri ,of thie ,experment at 31ome, -Naples, and the 6ther- :States is traceable to the hatred of Austria, to the - insinceitiy of the Governments in alliance with her, .to the. general conviction among the peopie that te' concessions were extorted, and not voluntar,y, and to the little faith in promiies made in the 'houir. of' :Aanger, but wlieh 'were, sure to be violated. the' instant they 'oould be done so with impunity. --_ The. liberty of 'the Piedmontese.would have succxumbed ;in 1848 as it did in 1821'had Austrian dominatioi niot been - thirown off, _and Piedinont would be pointed at, -as Rome,-. Naples, and'- TUs_ cany now are, in proof of the - utter inaptitude of- the Italian for government. You will get no Italian to believe that Austria really intends to introducs ameliorations in the moral or material condition of her Italian-subjects. No one believes in her truth. She-roused Italy to arms by simiar hopes durinthe lastrsaggle withNapoleon, and*henthe colosus.wa overthrown and she had :nothing:to fear she forgot her most solemn pledges. In 1849 the capitulaton of yenice was obtained by assurancee that liberal istitutions should be granfed. :ow4 these were kept we all know. Bat, were Austria astrastworthy as she is false, it is not believed that she cauatnelibrate the condition of her Italian posseesions. She fears and hates Piedmont -for her constitutional Government, and she cannot place Lombardy in a condition to be admired and envied by Hungary1 and Bohemia. But, were she disposed and able to do so, all the reforms sihe may introduce in her own possessions, or allow: to be introduced at Rome or Tuscany, would not avail her in gaining the- affection or securing the loyalty-of the ltalia. Her reforms they woulda accept, but they would not fail to use them, as they have already done, as an instrument towards complete liberation. - Italy will - never rest contented while a German is on her soil; - and, as M. Cavour observed to M. Buol on the last day of the Paris Conferences, it must be "all ornothing." The Italian people- will never be reconciled to their oppressors, nor will they ever feel loyal to their own rulers who are indebted to foreign support for their thrones. Fire and water will sooner combine than the Italian and the German. Between them there is nothing common, I either in nature, or in temper, or in taste, or in habit. The Germanlooksdownupontne Italian, and the Italian repays his contempt with intense enmity. With a more comprehensive hatred than Shylock, the Italian -will have no relation with the German, " will not talk with him, walk with him, eat with him, drink with him, nor pray with himn." This anti-German feeling is not weakened by time; in ancient books, where the name of German occurs it is often coupled withl some ignominious expression, and in our -day thg name hardly escapes ltalian lips without some contemptuous and foul epithet. -Tis state- of things is serious, and its danger is not dimninished by the Conference of Paris or by the debates i the En,glish Parliament. Several of the Italian Liberals seem to count upon the Emperor Louis Napoleon, and they may remind him of their former fellowship in the cause of Italian independence. It is a state of things which calls for the utmost attention of statesmen, for it is theirs to consider how the danger is to be prevented. PRUSSIA. (sMoX OUn ow corN 0 rNMsXr.) BERUIIN, Mky 17. The o infr was prevented yesterday by indisposition from setting of to meet the Empress of Russia at the frontier; whether his state of health will admit of his doing so to-day is not at present known to me. Colonel von Manteuffel, however, who is appointed Gentleman in Waiting to the Empress, and also Lieutenant-Colonelvon Schiutz, appointed to wait on the Grandl Duke Michael, duly left here yesterday for Gumbinnen, and the same train that took them thither conveyed also Baron Budberg and Count Benkendorff, the Russian Diploinatic and Military Envoys here, to go and receive their Empress. If all goes wel with the latter she will- sleep to-morrow night at -Gumbinnen, on this side of the frontier, and the following night at Konigsberg. To both these places a detachment of the culinary boranch of the Royal household has already been despatched in advance, with a plentiful supply of carpets and other funiture, in addition to the ordinary batterie de cuishie. However much gratification the King may experience at receiving hisImperial sister at his own Court, tre visits of the Empress are not the source of unalloyed delight to the Court circle, or to the ministering spirits who fetch and carry within those favoured precincts. A lady in the 58th year of her age, possessed of exalted rank, and " enjoying rery bad health," is apt to be caigeaxtIe, and rather reclkless of the feelings, inclinations, and occupations of those around her. UJnfortunately for Emperors and Empresses of Russia also, the habits of all subaltern officials attached to the Imperial retue deprive these augulst personages to a great extent of the resources which -riches afford them of bestowing liberal recompense for services rendered or salve for mortified susceptibility, the gems of the rings, the brilliant settinmg of portraits and snuff boxes, the characters of chronometers in rich cases, even the amount of bills paid, undergo a disadvantageous metamorphosis before arriving at the hands of the proper recipients. Tradesmen and artists, as well as courtiers, of this place could furnish evidence of the above enough to fill a pampllet, if it were wanted. The Postmaster-General also is an official who hears of Imperial visits with dismay; not only is an immense extra amouit of labour thrown upon him in providing travelling accommodation for the numerous retinue that always attends on Imperial Majesty, but also the expenses must be defrayed out of his budget; for by an arrangement between the two States " in this case made and provided," each State defrays the travelling expenses of the reigning family of the other within its own frontier. Furthermore, as Russia has much more frequently necessity and inclination to visit Prussia than is the case vie versa, the latter has in this arrangement, as in all others with Russia, the worst of the bargain. The existence of a railway from Konigsberg to Berlin of course very much decreases both the trouble and the expense of forwvarding so many guests of rank to the capital from the frontier, but previous to its construction the travelling expenses of the Empress and her suite to this place have figured in the aecountsof the Postmaster-General to the tune of 80,000 thalers. Among the various relatives of the Royal family who will be here to meet the Empress there will be the Grand Duchess Alexandrina, of Ifeecldenburg Schwerin, Princess Frederica of the Netherlands, and Princess Marie, her daughter. The inspection of the troops of the Guard takes place now almost every day, under the eye of the Prince of Prassia, who is almost always accompanied on these occasions by Prince Windischgriitz. The belief in the latter being intrusted with a political mission has rapidly vanished here, in spite of the Oeste-reichisclie C(orrespya?ze?z having denied his being so intrusted. The Prince has for a long time past been totally estranged from politics, does not stand on good terms -with Count Buol, and visits this Court in compliance with an invitation given - him by the King last year. In prosecuting trials and ex;periments on firearms, the task that has been assigned to a commnittee of which the Prince of Prussia is president, his Royal Highness seems indefatigables. These trials become mnore frequent and nore extensive every day; and among other weapons of recent construction the ialbiisen or rampart rifIes, formi now the subject of special atten-D tion. Tlhese rifles are constracted for the purpose of dismounting heavy ordnance on the ramparts of fortified places, by shootintg away the woodw ork of the carriage, and even by the injury they can inflict on the pieces themselves. In another matter- in which the Prince has taken great interest, and which brought him to Berlin earlier than he- would otherwise have come, he has- not met with the successL that might have been expected -when the heir apparent to the CrowFn exerts himself in its favour. In .the interest of the Rhenish provinces, of whichi he is the military commander, the Prinoe has left nostone unturned to prevent the new communal law,-which the present Government has just suel ceeded in- passing through the two Houses of the -Diet,'in spite of -the energetic opposition of the Rhenish deputies, from obtaiing the Royal sanction in i- present state. Irk consequence, of the representations nade to the King on the subject by Count Firstenberg-Stammheim and Herr von der Heydt the subject wasreferred back to the N:inistry for, rconsideration. At' two of the sittings of the Ministerial Council the Prince of Prussia presided, but. only, a very -small amount of concesion has been obtained from the Minister of the Interior, who had elaboiated( the measure and pased it through b6th- uses of the Legislature. This eoncession, though too small to appease the dissatisfaction of the PRheinlanders, whobse communal liberties and historical associations the new law circumscribes and offends, will be found great enough to provoke lively mIterpellations next session as to the right the Mfinistry and the Crown have to alter a law the* two Houses-have' acepted and passed without previously coniulting them. A constitutional. conflict will thus bewagdbetweentheHoe0 of theDiet, the Crown, the Ministry, and'the Provincial Dliets,wshobs -attributes and powers forma a constituent element 'in the' ne legislation; at the same time, the ntervention of the Prince of Prussia, althougl -exerted- ithe cause of the pre crp- .tive rights of the -Rhenish provin.e will --1b obnoiious to many attacks on the score of unconstitationality. As soon as the law' is publihed in its slightly altered form we may expect a considerable amount of agitation to arise-in the Rhenish onvinces, which, werenot therelationi of-Prhisia to France so good: as they actually Are woul.i:t,t be without da-nger; - -The Rheinlanders are still more -widely separated fro&mthe inhabitants: of the other iixpro inces by their frank, indeieutenie.ar1ink their love of freedom,- their Codes Nqpdeon, &C, tlan they are geographically, and- Whenerer-thlei is any political crisis there is a 'dankger, jor at :atiy' rate an apprehension, of these provinces fallingof from their allegiance to -thePrussian Crown, xaxc this dsager will certainly not be dec'e aed by tlhs Rheinan ders acquiring the conviction that their connexion with-the other six provinces, which outvote them in the Legislature, only tends -to curtal their long cherisihedliberties. THE GERMAN DTET. The following is the declaration which accompaniedthepresentationof theTreaty of Peaeebyth6 representatives of-Austria and Prassia to the Diet of Frankfort:- "The representatives of Au str ana Pruss-i, in conformity vith the orders of their Coarts,have the honourof submitting to the High Assembly a copy of the treaty concluded it Paris on the 30th March. The august Sovereigns of Prussia ind Austria are already convinced that the sentiments of high satisfaction with which they have laboured in thework of reconciliation, now so happily accomplished, wrill find a ready echo in the assembly of the representatives of the German Governments. IJniversal ce has been restored to the world, and one of the most aNg,erounpolitics cora. plications has received, through the moderation and disinterestedness of the Powers, a solution which -wilt give satisfaction to the general desire, and will furnish to history a memorable example of the magnanimous uion of the Sovereigns in their solicitude for the coromon interests of humanity. This solution responds at the same time in a complete manner to those points which were recognied by the Bigh Diet as constituting the mission of Germany on the Esternquestion. Already,ill its preceding decisions, has the Diet pronounco4 itself for the realization of the basis on which mainly depends the treaty vhich has been concluded. The Courts oE Au&stria and Prussa believe, in consequence, that their high confederates in Germany will not Peruse this treaty 'without finding therein a justification of the confidence whic?x they have but recently again displayed to the two Courts, by the resolution of Feb. 21 of the present year. The enlightened activity of all Governments, iuJt delivered by the meri Of Providence from the burdens of war, whic. directly or indirectly weighed on all Europe, will now turn, in rivalry of zeal, towards tLa development of the internal prosperity and the moral and material welfare of their re. spective States. The share which falls to Germany in this mission is grand and honourable, and the Governments wilL devotethesselves to it with a serious determination, sustained by a mutual friendship, and by the intimate bonds of relationship which unite them; nd 'wil likewise be excited by the unanimous wish tD add force to their con-. federation and to carry out its high aim." ITALY. (ErBox OIvB owi- COunr!SOhOxhr.) TURIN, MIx 13. Turin has been a scene of revelry the last three days, in hononr of the Constitution, of which this is the eighth anniversary since its proclamation by Charles Albert. On Sunday the usual religious and military ceremonies took place in the morningz. The King, accompanied by the Prince de Carignano,went on horseback, attended by a numerous staff, to -the open place in front of the Church of the Gran Madre di Dio, under the portico of which high mass was performed, attended by the Ministers of State, Corps Diplomatique, deputations from both Chambers of the Legislature, the magistracy, municipality, andotherpublic officers. Eu the Place immediately in front of the church, and in the Place Vittorio Emmanuele, onthe opposite side of the river, the troopswere massed. During the religious service His Majesty remained on horseback and uncovered, and on its conclusion he returned to the Piazza Castillo, where a defile of the troops, N'ational Guard, students, and trades took place. On this occasion the troops lately retuned from the Crimea headed the column, instead of the NTational Guard, as is usual. They consisted of General Durando's division, formeed of the brigades of Generals Fanti anld Oialdini. and their march was accompanied by incessant cheering from the crowds assembled in the streets and houses. They were dressed in the clothing in which they returned -from the Crimea, and their appearance denoted -robust health. I understand His Mlajesty was very much pleased with them, and if the approbation of their- fellow-citizens is grateful to these veterans, as no doubt it must be, they had the satisfaction of receiving it in the most unmistakeable manner. - On the afternoon of Sunday there were races onl the Camupo Marte, and at night a general -illumination, and a masled ball at the Eing's Theatre. Yesterday all the public galleries and the Royal Gardens were open to the public, and there -was a. distribution of prizes to the students at tho mnuicipal seminaries, and. in the evening a monster concert in the Piazza San Carlo, with illuminations. To-day there have again been races, and. a ball to-night at the Philharmonic Society's rooms concludes the festival as far as public entertainments are concerned, I believe; but the town will continue more than ordinarily lively probably for some days, in consequence of the vast number of strangers from the provinces and other parts of Italy. The amusements provided this year, and especially the illuminations, show a decided improvement in the art of public rejoicing (if it maybe so called), though itis neither a matter of statepolicy here, nor are the people by their nature particularly well' adapted for enjoying such displays; but there is one characteristic of a Turin crowd wrhich never fails to astonish all foreigners. and that is, its orderly conduct. Though the wliole population, with the addition of severalthousands of provincials, may be crowded into a few streets and squares on the nights of illumination, an accident, or a squabble even, israrely heard of. The police merely prevent carriages and horses from passing along the streets so occupied, and the good taste of the people in adhering to certain unwritten laws ot progression suffices for all the rest. The races have been better atteuded this year, too, by both men and horse3. On the whole, the citizens of Turin, and more particularly the innkeepers and cafe proprietors-the publicans and sinners, in fact-have most sold reason for cryig "Eeviv lo Statado," whatever may be their political faith.! The Piedmontese papers have latelY been much occupied in commenting on the tone of Count Walewsl's remarks in Congress regarding journaism in elgium, which are naturally looked upon here as equally directed towards the press of this country, and it has been said that the Belgian Government has addressed a communication to the Government here on the subject. There is no doubt indeed that ever since the cottp detat the Frencl Government has exhibited a most morbid sensitiveness of anything like criticism, but it must, or ought to be, perfectly aware that the remarks of papers openly circulated, and which are liable to prosecution for libel, are not one-hundredth part so hurtful as the black slanders disseminated by secret printing, as is done in all countries where a rigid censorship is maintainod, even in France itself, as was proved in the case of the Marianne conspiracy. In Central Italy, at this moment, there are numerous printingpresses constartlyat work,whichfarnish the readers of the papers issuing from them with matter such as no Piedmontese paper would dare to publish. The Governments of Central Italy are certainly not deficient in will to suppress this illegal traffic, yet it never seems to have occturred to them that a relaxa- tion of the prohibitory sstem miight be the most effectual for the purpose, just as low Custom-house duties wil ruin the smuggler's calling. In Piedm:ont there are no such things aS secret presses, because there is no demand for them. It would not pay -either morally or materially for an agitator to make use of such means in this country. People would%ot read his doctrines, because they can always obtaitn a reguar newspaper with the ordinary intelligence and gosip of the day, and as much serious politics as they require, without pains or penalties. There is a prosecutioninprogress here now by the Austrian Government against a Turin newspaper for abusive language towards the Emperor Francis Joseph,which wllf probably end in a conviction and iine, and there are no papers here so -violent against the 'Government of the countr as the organs of the clerical party, wvhich wish to impose a censorship, so that the mnerit Qf perfect impartiality must be a'warded to the Sardinian Government, andpro'bably, if common sense. only were allowed to regis. late the affair, other Governments would adopt the Sardinian system, instead of trying to forceit to adopt theirs, Mhe Marquis Provenziale has arrived here fromVienna to oocupy the post of Tuscan Itesidaent Charga d&Aftisres. His MIajesty the Kinc of Sardinia has charged Lieutenant-General Daborda with the mission of acknowledging to His Majestv the Czar the notifioati.ou of his accession to the Tlirone.
fGO2EY-MARKETaMd CITYINTELLIGBNOCE. Monday Evening. ,The announcement that the bidding of MIessrs. Rothschild for the New Loan of 5,000,000!. had been at 92,, and that it had bee1 taken by them at the YninimIZM fixed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-nanely, 93-has been followed by.a further general improvement in the English funds. The Stock-Exchange opened this morning at 10 o'clock, .the hour appointed for the negotiations at the Treasury, and a few transactions in Consols took place at yesterday's price of 93, to I before the terms of the contract became ;nowi, Upon the particulara reaching the city there was still for some time an absence of any material fluctuation, but about the maiddle of the day increased firm- i nem was manifeated, and a steady advance oc- curred of three-eighths per cent., which was well 1 -imaintained to the close, the final transactions 1aving been at 94 to J for money, and 94 to i for the 4th of June. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215; Reduced, 92s to 93; New Three per Cents, g3 to J; Annuities, 30 years, 17 1-16; India Stock, 228 to 230; India-bonds, Os. to 4i. discount; and Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 8. There was a disposition to purchase Exchequer-bills, and, as the miarket is not over-su'pplied, a slight recovery tool place, the last prices being (March) 4s. discount to par, (June) Gi. to 2s. discount. The scrip of the new loan was first quoted 1J pre. mnium, whence it advanced to 1i. The applications, including the amount required by Messrs. Rothschild themselves, are stated to have amountedto 40,000,0001., and the total paid on Friday as a 10 per cent. deposit was 3,700,0001. The proportion *lotted. was in most cases about one-tenth of theamount ask-ed for, but some applications of an immoderate character were cut down much below even that proportion. The surplus deposits will be returned by Messrs. lRothschild to-morrow, and the knowledge of that circumstance caused a tendencyto easeiin the moneyxnarket this afternoon. The value of the new Scrip, as compared with Consols, depends in some measure on the rate of interest which may prevail between this period and the 18th of September, when the last instalment wil be payable. The market price of Consols being 94j, and the Scrip being issued at 93, there is a direct difference of 1J per cent., but, as 100,. Scrip represents 1071. 10s. 7d. Consols, the profit of 1I per cent. on 71. 10s. 7d. must be added, as well as the interest saved by the interval allowed for paying up the ftlll amount. This interest at the existing rate of 6 per cent. would be equal to 19s., but under the anticipation of an early improvement in the money-market it will be more correct to take it at 5 per cent., or 15s. 10d. This would show the Scrip when Consols are at 94j to be worth a premiaum of 21. 2s. 10d.-namely, 11. 5s., the direct difference in price; 2s., the percentage of that difference on 7!. 10s. 7d. ; and 1s. 10d., the saving of interest. Foreign securities present little variation, but there is still a tendency to improvement. In Buenos Ayresthe transactions to-day were 76 and 79, the late advance being suppor;ed with remarkable firmness. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 98 and X for money, and 98; and 99 for the account; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed were purchased at 302i. The general business comprised :-Brazilian New, 96; Mexican, for money, 23j ; for the account, 23t and -; Portuguese Four per, Cents. ex. all over-due coupons, 48; Russian Five per Cents., 105Zs; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95 and 95k; Sardinian Five per Cents., 94, 93i, and 94; Spanish Certificates, 5 ; Austrian Five per Cents., 83; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64g; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 94i and i. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 75f. 40c. for money and 75f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing coutinued steadiness. About 200,000!. of the late gold arrivals is understeed to have been sold to the Bank to-day. Of the 180,000Z. of specie brought by the West India steamer to-day nearly 100,0001. is gold. The gold by the Arabia, from New York, viA Boston, is 190,5701., and there was every indication of a continuance of large remittances. The commercial advices on this occasion state business to have been influenced by an increased pressure in the moneymarket, the banks, alarmed by the rapid exportation of bullion, having further contracted their loans and discounts. The stock-market continued dull, and it was anticipated that little improvement could be looked for until the payment of the amount due to Texas next month, which will liberate 1,400,0001. of gold from the Federal Treasury. The shipments of specie by the PeninsuLar and Oriental steamerPera amountto 539,2421., of which 7,921!. is gold for Alexandria, Ceylon, and Madras, and 531,3211. silver for Bombay, Ceylon, Madras, and Calcutta. The following translation of a decree of the 31st of Mlarch, declaring the port of Carthagena a free port, has been forwarded to us for publication:- "The Senate and House of Representatives of New Granada, assembled in Congress, decree,- "Art. L From the 1st of September next the port of Carthagena, on the Atlantic coast, shall be completely free for all imports. In consequenceall vessels entering the said port, as well as all merchandise imported therein, shall be exempt from all fiscal dues. "Art. 2. The immunity of the said port shall only comprise that part of the district of Carthagena within the walls. " Art. .3. The Executive will issue the regulations that it may consider necessary for the opportune and due execution of the present decree. "Passed in Bogota Muach 29th, 1$56. "T. C. DE MOSQUERA, President of the Senate. "J. ANTONIO CALVO, President of the House of Representatives. M. M. MEDINA, Secretary of the Senate. "ANOEL PsOsBO, Secretary of the House of Representatives. LI.et it be put into execution and published, "M 3L I MAIALARINO, Vice-President of the Republic, intrusted with the executive power. "RAFAEL NUNEZ, Secretary of Finance." A work just issued by MIr. W. P. Andrew, theI chairman of the Scinde Railway, with the view of demonstrating the probable effect of that enterprise in developing the resources of the Punjab, also furnishes details of the project, whch seems now nearly ripe for execution, to connect the MIediterranean and the Euphrates by railway, and thus establish a route, vid the Persian Gulf, to all parts of India, which, it is estimated, will in the first in- stance shorten the commumication by nearly onehalf, and may ultimately effect a further great reduction. The desirableness of the undertaking has been recognized from the date of the surveys by General Chesney, and there appears little doubt that with the assistance of the Turkish Government it may speedily be accomplished. The length of the line, which would run from the port of Seleucia, in the Mediterranean, to Ja'ber Castle, on the Euphrates, where that river becomes navigable for 715 miles down to Bussorah, at the head of the Persian Gulf, is only about 80 miles, half of which distance is a perfect level, the remainder being also of a favourable character. From the head of the Persian Gulf it is nearly a straight course by steamer to the terminus of the Scinde Railway, at the port of Kurrachee, and, communication being thus established with the Indus, the connexion with all the most important points of our Indian possessions will be increased toa degree calculated to create another revolution in our ideas equal to that originally produced by the organization of the existing transit as compared with that by the Cape. A lance at the map, taking the Austrian railways to Treste, thence by steamer to Seleucia, thenoe by railway vid Aleppo to the Euphrates, and thence by river and ocean steamersto nurrachee, exhibits a di- rectes which, looking at the disance traversed, ix aimost nexamIed, and begets, when the evidence reopectng the absenoe of natural obstacles in alo eosidered, a conviction that on account - vaf itplBg XlQkI n4 3a its jinanvial wI Corn- "a c imptnce it will be regarded as one of the most prom ent among the several objects to which the conclusion of peace enables attention to be turned. The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week show a considerable interruption of business from the Whitsuntide holydays, weich, owingto the prosperity of the people, have bee generally kept in all quarters. At Manchester the transactions have been limited, and the tendency of prices has been towards flatness. The Birmingham iron-market is steadily maintained, since, although the supply of fresh orders has been small, nlnufacturers are fully engaged on previous contracts. In the general occupations of the place there are symptoms of improvement. At Nottingham agood inquiry has prevailed both for hosiery and lace. In the woollen districts increased caution is manifestd, owing to the high price of the raw niaterial. From the Insh lien-markets the accounts continue very favourable. At Dublin the provision trade has been influenced by large arrivals from America. A meeting of the Canada Company was held today, Mr. C. Franks presiding, to take into consideration the provisions of a bill before Parliament for increasing the general powers of management. The preamble and enactments were explained by 31r. J. Freshfield, and it was stated that the company wll not be allowed to return any portion of its capital until arrangements are made f.Jr a final liquidation. The following resolution was passed unanimously:- " That the bill now submitted to the proprietors, entitled 'An Act for granting certain Additional Powers and Authorities to the Canada Company,' be approved." The departures from the psrt of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised teven vessels,-three to Port Phillip, one to Adelaide, one to Sydney, one to Hobart Town, and one to Launceston,--with an aggregate capacity of 5,324 tons. The rates of freight in some cases exhibit a tendency to increased firmness. The report of the' rust and Loan Company of Upper Canada for the last half-year shows the net profits to have amounted to 9,6691., which, added to the sum brought forward from September last, gives a balance at credit of revenue of 9,7101. Out of this it is recommended that a dividend be paid at the rate of 7j per cent. per annum (less incometax), also that one-half of the surplus profits over 6 per cent. per annum be put to reserve fund, in accordance with the charter, and that 2501. be carried to redemption of preliminary expenses, leaving 106L The reserve, with the above addition, amounting to 1,5641., and interest 2901., will then be 9,8171. R esolutions confirning those adopted at the re- cent meeting of the English shareholders of the' Royal Swedish Railway are understood to have been passed on Saturday at a general meeting of the com-I pany at Gothenburg.I The following is from the Mexican and South American Company: " The company have received advices from their melting establishments m Chili by the Parana. The dates from Hesradura are to the 1stult. The Henry Ranking had completed her loading at Tongoy, and sailed for Swansea on the dlst of March with 450 tons of copper regulus and cop- per ores."
THE NEW LOAN OF FIVB MILLIONS. [The following appeared in our second edition of yes. terday :-1 A numerous attendance of capitalists took place this (Monday) morning attheTreasurytowitnessthe biddinga for the new loan of 5,000,0001. Shortly after 10 o'clock a.m., the hour appointed for the business, the gentlemen in attendance, including Baron L. Rothschild, Sir A.Rothschild, Mr. J. Cape,, Mr. Norbury, Mr. Biddulph, MIr. R. and Mr. T. Thornton, Mr. B. Cohen, Mr. -L. Cohen, Mr. Iarjoribanks, Mr. Laurence, Mr. Cazenove, Mr. B. B. Williams, &c., were received by Lord Palmerston, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. J. Wilson, on the part of the Government. The Governor and Deputy-Governor of the Bank were also present. The Chancellor of the Exchequer having handed to the Governor of the Bank a sealed paper, containing the minimum terms which the Goverment were prepared to accept,. Baron L. Rothschild observed there was one rather important question which he wished to asl, -What were the intentions of the Government with regard to Exchequer-bills? The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-I stated at our previous meeting what were the intentions of the Government. We have no intention, at least no expectation,' of issuing Exchequer-bills. I presume it is to issuing bills you refer ? Baron Rothschild.-No, not exactly that. The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-Well, as to the rate of interest, all I can say IS that notice upon that subject will shortly be given, but I am afraid I can't give any further information just now. Baron Rothschild.-The Government, then, have no intention of funding? The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-No; that I stated before,-that the Government had decided not to fund at present. Baron Rothschild.-The question to be decided [is, whether you will increase the rate of interest, for that may makea difference in the terms. Exchequerbills in their present position can scarcely be said to float. The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-They are not at a very great discount yet, and that is a question which at present cannot be decided. Is there any gentleman present who is disposed to make an offer for the New Loan ? Baron Rothschild handed in a paper containing his tender. No other tender being offered, The Chancellor of the Exchequer opened the paper handed to him by Baron Rothschild, and read- " MIayI 19, 1856. "Sir,-We begto offer fortheproposed loan of 5,000,0001. tobepaidforat the periods mentionedinthepublionotice of the8thinst.,atthe rateof 108g. Three per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, with dividend from January last, for every 1001. in money, on which we are ready to pay the required deposit. "To the Chancellor of the Exchequor." The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-That is not equal to our terms. How much is that equal to in. Consols ? Baron Rothschild.-Very nearly 92g. Mr. Wilson.-Or 9?* 31r. J. CapeL-It is between 924 and 92g. Baron Rothschild.-It is within 9d. of 92g. The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-Well, that is not equal to our terms. Will the Governor of the Bank open the paper which I have placed in his hands? The Governor having opened the paper read the minimum terms ofthe Government7-1071.10s. 7d., or equal to 93. The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-There is therefore a difference of J. Baron Rothschild.-Will you allow us to retire for a few moments, as before? The parties then retired. On their return, Baron Rothschild, addressing the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said-We have decided on accepting your terms. The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-Very good. You will please sign the usual paper. Baron Rothschild.-Yes. Your terms are 1071. 10s. 7d., or Consols at 93? The Governor of the Bank.-Precisely so. The contract was then signed in due' form, and the parties immediately withdrew.

HE LATE MAUJOB-GENE1VL SIR W. H. SLEEMA24f:lkKC.X l : ., 'The announcement of .t de'ath of-SirWilim enry Eleeman, made in our columns yestefday2-has caused the Createst regret in all circlescon"ectedn*ith India. The deceased General enteredthe mlitary-seivice of the EastIndia Company in 1808, so that 'he lied devoted a life of nearly half a century to active eiplo3-meht in the East. For several years he had discharged with. the greatest zeal and ability, the duties of British Resident at Lucknow, in--the kingdom*of Onde, and it isin connexion with-that country that-hisname will be longest remember&"' ThI the earlier part .6f his offluial career he,,iel been assistant in - the Saugar and Nerbudda.diatrict, where he gained an immense amount of experiean, and an accurate knowledge~ of Central India which-Sfterwards was tiurned tq,_-goo account. In laS4 wdlfind him British Resident.atnfWalior; this.appointmenthJe held during the criticaW times which ultimately led to hostilities in that SuyarUfi5.;nd resulted in the ;battle of Maharajpore. Itj,my be remembered that, - soon fter his arrival in India; liord Ellenborough thougbt fit to.aaks extensive chand among the military and civil officers who conducted the judicial and reveaue departments in -the Sauguur and Nerbudda district. Among those iv-hom he appointed to the vacant posts was Colonel -Sleeman, who lost no time in proving that, if he haad been an efficient servant in an inferior position, bewvas an. able organizer and administrator as well. It sthould be imentioned to Colonel Sleeiman's credit that he was one. of the very first person iin high authoritywho cornmenced-thegood work of suppressing the* system kn6wn as "Thuggeef"' that the official papers drawn up upon the suoject :ererenainly the waork of his pen; and'that the departnaeitThich was specially commissioned for this insportant purpose was not only organized, but worked by him. Sch be. - as antecedents, it is not surprising, therefore, thatolonel Sleeman became intimately und exteniely-aqua ted with the native character, and proved himsdIf-the right-hand man of Lords Ellenborough, 'lardinge, raid -Dalhousie, the latter of whom frequently refers in despaithnes to Colonel Sleeman's diary. Neither is it surprising that,4 in dealing with such a State as that of Oude, Lord DaiLkousie should have, looked to his Resident at Lucknow for -tmstworthy information and steady support. Colonel Sleeman had not resided in that capital without obsern that its internal 'adm inistration was hopelessly corrupt, and that no course was open to the British Government but one-namely, that of bringing it under British lTaws. Colonel Sldeman beheld a fertile soil looking like a desert, with villages plundered and deserted; a Cout --allownnrg in uikury and effeminacy; the Mlinister carele2s and negligent of all public duties; the - towns infested with.mnrderers and assassins, and the vhole -country rnarauded 'by,noble robbers called "Zemindars," at constaint war -with .the no less noble bodyof Chucklidars, or- representatives of the King. Added to this, so far had 'nattars gone that on one occasion, in July, 1S54, a Bengal paper. the Hurb-rze, states that " Coknel Slecman, the able and cautious Resident at Lucknsv$'.detected a letter sent from the King -of Persia to His Majesty.of Oude, in which the former -monarch spoke hoptully .of a Persian invasion of India, ,and "promised in that-exeit,to do all that he could for the ,a-tability of Oude." As.a proof of the insecurity of life in Qlucknow, we may mention-that only a fewv months previously an attempt waz made tby night upon the life of ,<olonel Sleeman himsevf in his own house, which attempt -enonly escaped by hat&xig.fortnnately changed his bedroom rbc±. evening.

COURT OF COMfON COUNCIL. PRESENTATION OF TH1, FREEDOM OF THE CITY GOT AfIAL LYONS. Yesterday aspecial court was held, for the purpose of pre-I senting the freedom of the city to Admiral Sir Edmund5 Lyons, Bart., G.C.B., agreeably to the resolution unanimously passed in the Court on the 28th of February last. The cotrt had a remarkably briliant appearance, a number of ladies from the other end of the metropolis having honoured it with their presence. We observed among the visitors Lord and lady Clarence Paget, Major-General Sir Henryand Lady Bentinck, Lord hi'ward Howard, Lord Je~es and Lady Rachel Bntler, Captain Eden, R.N., Admiral Lord and Lady Radstock, Lord Charles IRussell, the Governor and the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of England, the Chairman of the East India Company, Mr. and Mrs. Thomson Hankey, Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Hankey, and Miss Lyons; Major Pearson, Captain George E'liott, Captain Carnegie, Captain Greville, Lord George Paulett, Colonel Sykes, Sir James Clark, &c. Sir Edmund Lyons was introduced by Mr. Deputy Dakin and MIr. Alderman and Sheriff Kennedy, the mover and seconder of the resolution, and was received with hearty cheers. The LORD MAYOR having intimated to the Court that the Queen had been pleased to return a gracious answer to the address of the corporation on the ratification of the peace, the special business of the day commenced. Mr. John Sewell, the clerk to the Chimberlain, read the introductory declaration, signed by Deputy Dakin, Alderman and Sheriff Kennedy, and Deputies Harrison, Thomas Rowley, John Wood, and Henry Lowman Taylor. Sir JoaD KEY (the chairman) then addressed Sir Edmund Lyons in the followingmanner,-Grateful as is the duty which devolves upon me to offer to a newly admitted member of our brotherhood the first token of civic welcome, yet is it a part of my office which was far more pleasant to anticipate than I find it easyto discharge; for, Sir, the tribute of respect which itis my privilege, on behalf of this Court, to offer you on the present occasion I need hardly say is no tribute from us as a mere assemblage of citizens, but from us as the trustees of a great national distinctionfrom us as the dispensers of an honour which has been thought to add lustre to the patriot's name and new laurels to the victor's brow-from us as those accredited exponents of public feeling from whom the rest of the country learns how to do homage to its wise, and how to reward its brave. To be the trusted interpreter of the Court under such circumstanceswas, therefore, I feel to be, no common responsibility. For though nothingl could say could add to your honourfrom this day's proceedings, I may well fear lest by my omissions I should disparage or lessen theirs. (Hear, hear.) lTeither, Sir, does it diminish the difficulty of an address like this that your claims on the regards of your countrymen are so many and various that aU the powers of a eulogists judgment must be taxed to decide whether in. his honourable mentions he shall give the foremost place to the commander or the diplomatist, to the organizer of snartial enterprises or the keen observer of the intrigues of Courts, to the hero who in war has upheld the British seaman's Xuntarnished fame or the councillor honoured with a 410narch's coalidence, to advise advisers, and to considei the best terms of pe<ice. Still, Sit, I think I know enough of. a saior's heart to feel assured that he will allow no hohoulrs to stand in competition with professional honuours, with the rewards of those adventurous exploits bodied forth in life's youngest and fondest dreams, with the insignia.. he.ilears about him, of a country's gratitude-for flra.Ning his faithful sword in the conflict and guiding his noble vessel through the deep, and in you, Sir, especially, should I expectto find this preference; for eclipse the lustre of your professional reputation nothing can. Already have been recited'ii; this court some of those early auguries of uiobleIromise which made e_pectation fasten i'felf`libon yolk'1the man raised forthe country's day of trial. (93dl- f) Already have we heard of that feat of dariinngj the coast of J*ra in w.ichp with your two boats' crewsj of kindred spirits, yi,V storiHied, captried, and destr4'ed the strongly-mounted fort of the enemy, mode4ly beariig back to your incredulous superior the .torm down and dishonoured flag, a testimony to after ages of that characteristic of our seaman's valour which, when his country's honour is at stake, rejoices inthe difncult,thinks scornofthedangerous, ignores and denies thefimpossible. (Cheers.) Already has attention been called 16 another bold and successful enterprise, which we deem it now no presumptionto attribute to that Divine Power that dothshapehuman events-tothatfar-seeingProvidencewhich was even then ordaining the means for our success in the oncoming European struggle. I allude, asyou will suppose, to your s ul conduct of the Blonde into Turkish waters in the year 1S29; to the keen insight you acquir&d thereby into the warlike capabilities of an unscrupulous and aspir ngPower; to your determination not to rest till the British flag was seen in the very harbour of tltat far-famed fortress which it had required years of unexamnpled energy to construct, as it has cost the best blood of two great nations to capture and destroy. (Cheers.) Yes, Sir, already have we heard of these achievements, and of others like them, and yet you will not wonder if to us, as civilians, there is one passage in your professional life which outshines in glory all your deeds of daring. Sir, think not we account.lightly of the imperishable honours which have accrued to you from the victories of Kertch and Rinburn. Deem not there is among us an imagination so dull, or a heart so cold and dead-as not to sympathize with the dauntless crew of the- Agamemnon when they seemed almost to vie with the granite walls beside them in the bold front they opposed to a hostile and determined fire. * But we feel that we give utterance to a sentiment, to which your brave heart will be the first to respond when we -say that -no -honour which could have come of having destroyed an enemy's forces could compare withptheglory of having, uner circumstances of unexampled difiiculties andPr been perm itted to save our own (loud cheers); and this glory, under the gudance of God's good providence, is yours. 3venunow dowe trembleto think what might havebefallen our nation's martial pride and strength if the embarcation of the army at Varna, or the arrangements for its transport acrOSS the Black Sea, or the preparation for landing a force extending over 16 miles of water, had been intrusted to a mind of ordinary energy, or to a commander of common genius and powver. But the eyes of Europe were to be drawn to a spectacle of unparalleled martial grandeur-to a mighty armada, moving in obedient lines upon the troubled ocean, with aol the precision of troops on a peaceful and nutented field, and then to the descent of nearly 60,000 men, without an enemy to oppose their lauding, or a single casualty to mar theptriumphs of the day. Sir, the present may not be the time to advert to that painful narrative of offiCial incompetency and neglect by which so much of precious treasmue and more precious lfe has been los to our country; but it is the time to testify with grateful emphaids to those hioh and commanding qualities by which, in the hour of OUr nation's peril, all that we hold dear to us was saved, and therefore, taking up the words of one of whom itisnot toomuch to say that be has elerated newspaper writing to the dignty of history, and the office of an agent of the daily press to that of an unpaid people's ambassador I repeat it, Sir, as the conviction of this Court, that "hut for you the mightiest armament of our own, or of any time, might have otted in the camp, or, at the best, have wasted itself in ignoble enterprises of no beneofit to the ehxpedition and no honour to our country's arms." (Cheers.) But, Sir, vrhile in deference to your professional predilection and in admiration of yourlheroic conduct and untiring energy inhyouricoutry's cause, I have chosen to give the prominence in these remark s to your servicess a a naval commander, I cannot consent to cast into the shade the fame which has gnthered round your diplomatic, character, or omit to notice how much a nation's hopes were centered in you as an adviser n the comncils of peace. Surely the instance is no common one, even in the lives of England's noblest worthies, of a man caled at the outbreak of a war from the duties of a pacific embassv because his country had need af him to guard her fleet, and then, before warcconclded, carmed from that fleet again because his country could not spare him from her councils in negotiating ter powith a disheartened foe. But in both these measures we recognise on the pact of Ifer Mfajesty's Goverament a wise and discriminating choice,, a right anureciation of that varied experience and those locked-up stores of wisdom acquired by your long politiegi residence at Atens and at Stockholm-n- residence whinch they-knew you had employed not only in keeping a vigiant outlook upoua ahl the statecraft and- policy of qhe great Power maf ao 2Torte , tit which you hid isrado subservient also to -t'ce enlargement of your professiunid knowledge of the dctent of. Ihis materil resources and thegnature of the struggle in which you felt your country ~uld soon have to engage. 'To you, we nothing doubt, durin;g hcse neatly 30 yeas~ of,diplomatic service, it was hecoming ecrayearmore appacenieow insidiously, but surely, the pLkss of.acvt ambitir. ,wtte becomngsn 4evloped. lTow the favowed policy of thse ,Orar Peter with regard to Tulrkey ivas ,beiq cherished by 12is.ccessors-a secret but sacred heir:loomn of ancestral pcsite which their rigiathand shonldlosedsscunning before sic,' Zscupant of his throne should forge.

(Cheers.) Aimated with these feelings, nehave the greatest pleasure in presenting to you this box, which Ikinow you will estimte, not so much for i ntrin sic value as because it contains the freedom of this ancient city, within whose wals constitutional liberty has ever been cherished in the worst of times and under the most adverse circumstances. (Loud cheers.) Sir EDMUN LYONS addressed the crowded auditory in nxearly the following words :-Mt Lor Mayor, Mr. Chamberlain, and gentlemnen,-It would be vain for me to attempt to express how deeply sensible I am of the distinguished hdnour conferred upon mue by you, wfhom I am indeed proud to address as fellow-citizens. (Cheers.) The freedom of the city of London, in acknowledgment of services rendered to the Sovereign and the country, has ever been considered a laudable obiect of ambition by naval officers. The hopes of arriving at this honour were' awakenedin my breast at a very early age, by reading when aboy that it had been conferred upon Nelson. Those hopes I have cherished ever since, and now that they are happily realized I find that, instead of the reality faUing short of the anticipation, as is too often the case, my feelings of pride and satisfaction are, on the contrary, uubounded, for it is indeed a proud thing to receive such a proof of confidence and goodwil from the most enlightened and important commercial body that ever existed-a body whose influence is beneficially felt, not only at home, but all over the civilized world. (Loud cheers.) The Chamberlain has done me the honour to speak in very complimentary terms of my public life. In zeal for the good of the public service I yield to no man, and during the two-and-forty years I have served abroad in diplomacy and in the navy I certainly have conscientiously performed my duty to the best of my humble abilities, and I must say that on all occasions I have been so ably supported by those serving under me as to render my task comparatively easy, and particularly during the last three winters, in the Black Sea, and on no occasion more than when the Agamemnon-as alluded to by the Chamberlain-seconded by the Sanspareil and London, attacked Fort Constantine. And here I must observe that in every general action, both by sea and land, though aU are animated by the same ardent desire to be foremost in the fight, some ships and some regiments have the good fortune to be:.iA a more prominent position than others. On this occasion every ship in the fleet took up 'her appointed station with the greatest precision, and performed her part nobly when in it. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, as your interests and feelings are, I know,'so much identified with those of the navy, it may not be irrevelant to say a word or' two on that subject;: I believe that most of us were at Spithead last month, when the Queen reviewed a fleet which for combined 'grandeur, power, and originality was never equalkffi (Loud applause.) It was impossible not t6 be shtok with admiration at the external apbearance of that imposing armament as it presented itself to our vew, a proof of the marvelous resources of this jcountry) and forming, as it did,' but a portion of Her Majesty's naval forces, for we bave a large fleet in the Mediterranean and ships of war in all parts of the world; butthe admiration so excited is much increased when we reflect upon the order, discipline, cheerfulness, and patriotism that reigned within, and still further increased by a fact which I have mentioned on more than one occasion, and which is worthy of being mentioned again and again, for it will figure in a bright page of our history when contrasted with the state of things that existed in former wars-I allude to the fact of the whole of Her Mlajesty's fleet being manned by volunteers (cheers,-men who came forward of their own freewill to serve their Queen and country. I think too much credit cannot be given to the naval branch of Her Majesty's Government for the manner in which the manning of the navy has been lately conducted; and I learn with great satisfaction that in the reduction consequent on the peace the men are discharged in a way which shows them that their good conduct is appreciated and their convenience consulted. (Cheers.) I fear I have very inadequately expressed my feelings of pride in becoming your fellow-citizen and my gratitude to you for the kind and handsome manier in which you have received me. This beautiful box will be handed down as an heirloom, and preserved by my children and children's children as a memorial of one of the proudest events of 'my life. The whole Court rose and cheered the gallant Admiral at the close of his address, and the Lord Mayor immediately intimated that the proceedings of the day were at an end. His Lordship then invited the whole company to lunch at the Mfansion-house, and entertained them in the Egyptianball.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES. I . * Sir,-Iobservethat the statement I made before the Board of General Offlicers at Chelsea Hospital on Thursday last is in some respects incorrectly reported in Tze !rirnes of Friday, owving, probably, to my not having spoken loud enough; but there is one error which I should be much obliged to you to allow me to correct. It is where I am mada to say that while my reqnisition for hay to be sent from England was for 580 tons per month, only 275 tons per month was forwarded. What I did say was that the whole quantity sent out for the service of the army in the East during the two months of October and November was 270 tons, and that of this there was received in the Crimea only 228 tons up to the 22d of January, a period of nearly four months. I request you will have the goodness to permit this explanation to be inserted in your next impression. I have the honour to be, Sir, v - J Your obedient servant * I WHIIM FILDER, O.G. , | 57, Eaton-square, M1ay9.

-T:E CRBMR:A2 BOARD OF INQUIRY.<- - CO2NCLlUSION OF TRE INESlTrA TrTnv Yesterday the Board of General Officers met again at Chelsea Hospital and resumed the inquiry, which they concluded before separting. The attendance of the public was not so great as on many of the preceding days. It has been evident, indeed, of late that the interest which the investi-' gation excited in the first instance was on the decline. Captain Heath, R.N., the principal agent of transports in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, to whom, at his request, the board had given permission to answer certain evidence as to his conduct as transport agent at Balaklava, given by Colonel Gordon before the Crimean Cornuissioners, appeared and made a statement. He said, Colonel Gordon, in his evidence before the Crimean Commissioners, gave first his general reasons for thinling the sea transport should be unuLer a merchant captain, instead of one in the Royal navy, and then a s ial reason founded-on his (Captain. Eeath's) individu conduct. It was upon this latter point that he wished to address the board. Colonel Gordoi stated, first, that- " Great benefit would be derived if the transports of the army were placed under the direction of a captain of the merchant service instead of under a captain of the 'Royal navy. The former are more accustomed to berthing ships in a crowded harbour than the latter (who rarely enter a small port with a mnoSf-war), and they are naturally more familiar withthe dnties of receiving and discharging cargo, ac., than officers of the Royal navy. Thinks there would be less form and offlcial etiquette necessary witha merchant captain, and less reference to the admiral on the station, iwho is frequently at a distance. Cannot see what the admiral in command of the Royal navy need have to do with the fleet of transports belonging to the army when they are not under weigh together. It would also be a great convenience to the military service if this oficer, whether of the Royal navy or merchant service, were required to have an office on shore for the transaction of hisbusiness with the army, as has frequently been requested by the military authorities, who have offered to place a building at their disposal for ihis purpose. During Captaina Christie's time the inconvenience was less felt than at present, as he for some time lived on board a vessel with a gangway, so that we could walk on board from the shore, and latterly his vessel was within speaking diEtance of the shore at the upper end of the harbour ; but Captain Heath, the present agent of transports, finds it necessary to live on hoard aman-oS-war steamer, at the outer end of the harbour, n Cossack Bay, rendering the transaction of business very inconvenient, especiaUly where wounded and sickofficers are concerned, who often have to wait at the water-side until a communication can ho had with Captain HIeath or his clerk in Cossack Bay. The French military authorities who have considerable experience in these matters, Sind it quite unnecessary to have a ' Principal Agent of Transports' and his assistants, with the correspondence consequent upon an intermediate office, but transact their business direct with the masters of vessels." Colonel Gordon then drew a personal contrast between him (Captain Heath) and Admiral Boxer and Captain Christie in tese terms:- " Our own Commissary-General finds no difficulty in managing the commissariat vessels without the intervention of a captain of the Royal navy; on the contrary, wvitness expects he finds considerable advantage from a direct communication with the captains, and thinks the same system might be adopted with regard to the army transports, thereby saving a great deal of official correspondence and routine; not that Admiral Boxer or Captain Christie made any difficulties,-on the contrary, they most readily undertook whatever they were asked to do,-but this varies with the man employed; for instance, Captain Heath finds it incompatible with the ' dignity of his position' to continue the practice adopted by his predecessor of sending a daily report to the Quartermaster-General of the arrivals and departuresat Balaklava, stating whether the vessels contain troops,.stores,-&c As a compromise-he allows one of his subordinate officers to do so, but declines to sign it as Captain Christie used to do." With respect to the question of whether it would, on th whole, have been better for him to have lived on board a transport or on board a man-of-war, he begged to state to the board that his duties as Principal Agent of Transports were of a very varied nature, and by no means confined to that particular branch which was connected with the Quartermaster-General's department; and, in order to show this more clearly, be begged to refer the board to an extract from the written instructions given him by Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons:- " You are to assnme (said Admiral Lyons) the charge and commnand of the various steamnvessels and sailing transports vhich have been or may be hereafter chartered by the Admiralty, for the conveyance of troops or military stores, and you will take care that these vessels are always kept in an efficient state, fully manned, in accordance with the charterparties, and tat all times ready for service; and that the respecetive agents or masters in. command perform their duties in a proper and attentive manner. As the transports have been chartered for the special service of the army, it will be your duty to attend to al requisitons which you may receive from the Commanders in-Chief or officer in the command of the troops, and to afford every assistance in your power to forward tAhe miitary service. With this view you wrill correspond direct with him on all subjects which relate to the emnbarcation, landing, or mnovement of troops or military stores by sea, keeping the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty as well as myself (Admiral Lyons), informed of the same, and, if ncgssary, the Rear-Admiral Superindents in the Bosphorus and at Yalta. You will control the movement of all steamvessels and transpoorts which are under your orders, and you wil afford ~tiicli assistanceetoFiieh (AdidirarL ns) and totlhe RearA dmiral Superintendents in the Bosphorns and at Malta as may be necessary forthe conveyance of stores or* provisions when it does not in any manner interfere with military movements."- . It seemed to him (Captain Heath) that in order to insure an efficient control over the service- afloat, and to superintend effectnally the various active duties devolving on him, it was proper that he shouldlive on board. ship; and that in order to be in an independent position as regarded the transports, it was highly advisable that such ship should be a mian-ofwvar, by which means he should alsD be 3nore free to niove from port to port if the circumstances of the campaign should require it. These views being coincided in by Sir Edmund Lyons, the Triton, a email steamer, with paddlebox boats, which would be useful in the harbour waS placed under his orders, and she was moored, in Cossack Bay, because thence he could command a view of the ships at the outer anchorage. and because she would in any other part of the harbour have taken up room much wanted by vessels discharing cargo. With regard to any inconvenience arising to the Quartermaster-General's department from any supposed difficulty in communicating with him, he had to state that it took about five minutes for an ordinary hoat to pul from the Ordnance-wharf to his ship; that there were at the time when Colonel Gordon gave his evidence in the Crimea upwards of 30 registered and licensed boats plying for hire at od. a trip ; that there was from morning until night a lientenant at the sickwharf with transport boats in attendance waiting for sick, who, ifapplied to, vWould always send off any message or persontohim; and moreover, that the master of the Baraguay d'Hilliers, while that transport was in nort and after she had sailed the master oE the Bncephalus, had strict orders to answer any one who hailed from the beach, close to which his ship was moored, and to send off in his boat at any hour of the day or night any person wishing to communicate with him, or anyletters that might be sent; and that this arrangement was officially notified to the officers of the Quartermaster-General's departmient. With respect to the inconvenience vwhich Colonel Gordon stated was suffered by sick and wounded officers, he begged to hand in letters from Lieutenants .oss and Scott, the officerswho superintended the embarcation of sick, showing that statement to be unfounded. As to the second portion of Captain Gordon's evidence, of which he complained, he begged to state that, as he was never called on to sign the reports in question, he never could, as Colonel Gordon said; have "'compromised the matter by allowing one of his (Captain Heath's) subordinates to do so." The true facts were as follows:-On the morning after he had relieved the late Captain Christie, the boarding officer, Lieutenant Hutchinson. brought in two reports of the arrivals and sailings of the previous day, one for himself (Captain Heath), and the other for the Quartermaster. General. lieutenant Hutchinson statedatthe sametime that Captain Christie used to signthe latter, and he (Captain Heath), thinlkng the officer who was personally acquainted with the matter of- the report was the right person to sign for his work, directed him to do so, both then and in future - and until he' (Captain Heath) read the evidence of Colonei Gordon,he iever Imew that the change had been noticed, still Iess that it had been considered worthy of mention before- the Crimean Commissioners. It appeared that Colonel Gordon's evidence ivas left for some time in his own hands for 'revision and correctio2. Colonel Gordon had placed inverted commas before anid after the words "dignity of his position" as if inuuotation; but he (CaptainHeath) thought he might nevertheless safely afflrm that no such expression ever escaped his lips or hIns pen, for he should indeed be sorry if he had allowved any trivial notions of etiquette to interfere with the public service. He thanked the Court for affording himthat bpportnnity of publicly answeringt the accusations of Colonel' Gordon. -- The letter of Lieutenant Scott, written in April last and referred to by Captai Heath, stated that whenever a sick or. wounded oncer presented limself on the wharf and requested to be sent to an hospital-ship withont having a re-. gular prder to be received on hoard, he was taken to his Lieutenant Scott's) hait until such order could be procured, and that no sick officer had ever been kept waiting on' the beach during the time he had charge of the ernbarcation of' the sick and wounded, commencing with May, 1855. Lieutenant GwsS, who attendeathe embarcation of the sick -up to the end of Mfarch, aLso - stated, ir' a letter to Captain Heath, that he did not remember tLe case of an officer serious] indisposed being kept on the wharf, though itsometimeshpened that sick officers arrived before their medical atten2 ants, -and might have had to vait a short time until their aval, . . Colonel Gordon, in reply to the statement of Captain jUeath, said, when - the queston of sea -transport, in *-eerence to which he had had a great amount of re,respondence, was under disnascioji before the Crimean Collssioners, -he. thought * it - his duty to point out to' them what had been a souree of very great iuconv,-ience to the department of the Quartermaster- General, and what he stated to the Commissioners wasper-, fect7y corMt. He ight, perhaps, have bee1 in error in, attribatirg ta Captain heath the expression, " dignity of hisposition," ia the extract just read by that gentleman from his (Colonel Gordon's) evidence before' the Commiissioners;.but' he uriderstood General Aireyto say Captain Heath haduseeRit h an interview he had vith him on a matter of business, ad she (Colonel Gordon) gave it a few days after hehaditfiom i^eneral Airey. If Cautain Heath was positive that he di-d not- anake use of-that expression he -would sdIit - that he hgd a,tributed it to him under a-mistaken' im-pression. - -Ca-a.i~ Heath migh4. perhaps, recall to his rec6llection tiat- off one occasion, when hle spok.e to him about -nt d sndindg- a report that was wwiited, he- told him' (Colonel. Gorcon) that the Quartermaster-General' had- nis ewn officer at lhak7lava, to wlham he Eiaightt apply fordf(-. liet P99nvI - Gordon) wras perfectly awvare of the ability with -which Ideuter,antsGoss and Scott performed theirduties in the embarcation of the sick and wounded but in his evidence before the Commissioners he specialyreferred to the' sick and wounded officers who were tak-enill in the mor having to wait for some time on the beach before they col be received on board an hospital ship. In the morning it was of thegreatest importance to getthem awayfrouthe scene of their sufferings: and it had been reported to him that mIny of those officers had been going about the harbour in boats seeking for Captain Heath, or his clerk, to get an order to go on board ship. 'The suggestion he made tothe Commissioners as to the necessity of havg an officer on shore was adopted after he left, and he had been informed that it was attended with the greatest advantage. With regard to the separation of the command of the transports from that of the fleet in the navy, that was a matter of opinion on which Captain Heath and himself might differ; but he (Colonel Gordon) was firmly of opinion that the divided command was the best, and he was confirmed in that opinion by the evidence of Sir James Dundas before the Sebastopol Committee. He would only further state that he. was desired 'to lay before the Commissioners all he knew asto the working of'the transport system, and he did so; and he was ready to calU General Airey and. cther officers, if need were, to confirmn the evidence he had given before them. Captain Heath said,he rather thought the officers to whom Colonel Gordon alluded had left the Crimea long after the time when Colonel Gordon gave his evidence bfore the Commissioners, and that they would speak to atime when there was great difficulty in finding transport accoimodation for officers wishing to leave. By General PERT-His (Catain Heath's) instructions were precisely similar to those given to Captain Christie, exeept in the preamble, which merely defined the place where they were respectively to exercise their functions. By the PFSEIEnDs.-He never changed the position of. his ship. It was necessary thathis ship should be moored in Cossack Bay, because he did not wish to takeup roomx that might be turned to better account in accoimnodating other vessels in the harbour, and because it was a good position for superintendingvessels lying in the outer anchorage. Colonel Gordon said, the returns sent to the Qaartermaster-General's department as to the transports were often inaccurate, and the Quartermaster-General wished to have the signature of a responsible officer to them, in conforraity with the rule acted upon by Captain Christie, but he was frequently unable to procure such signature, and eventualy he ceased to insist upon it. The Quartermaster-General and himself did not care who the transport oificer was provided he resided on shore, where they wanted him, and where they could easily transact business with him;- but they had the greatest difficulty in gettine to Captain Hieath when he lived in a ship out at sea. Perhaps the board would permit him to ask Captain Heath to read a letter which on one occasion he {Colonel Gordon) addressed to him, asling for a report to be furnished to him (Colonel Gordon) on the subject of a vessel to be prepared for some sick Turkish labourers, and to which letter Captain Heath replied by stating that his instructions did not authorize him to report to the Assistant QuartermasterGeneraL On the morning before the attack on th e Mamelon, as Lord Raglan was about to mount his horse, he told himn (Colonel Gordon), who was to accompany him, to write a letter to Captain Heath on the subject he hadjust mentioned. e did so, but on that occasion, in the hurry of the moment, he simply signed his own name to the letter, and omitted to add the words "for the QuartermasterGeneral." The reply of CaptainHeathwas, that hisinstructions did not authorize him to report to the Assistant Quartermaster-General. That was the only' occasion in which he (Colonel Gordon) ever remembered signing aletter emanating from the Quarmaster-Ceneral's Department with simply his own name. Captain Heath said that the reason he wrote the answer of which Colonel Gordon complained was, that the letter to which it was a reply was, though'net uncivil, very strongly worded for a subordinate. He added that, in an interview he afterwards had with General Airey (to whom he made a similar remark when the subject was under conversation), General Airey said he was aware that Colonel Gordon's mauner was very bad, and that he had a great want of tact. He destroyed Colonel Gordon's letter after that interview, which would account for his inability to reoduce it now before the board. Colonel Gordon said that was the first occasion he had ever received a complaint as to the style of his letters from any one, and he asserted that he never wrote a letter which was not perfectly civil, and in which he did not use the word "r equest" when asldng for a report from any officer whose duty it was to report to the Quarmaster-GeneralPs department. He thought, too, that if General Airey had had any reason to complain of his (Colonel Gordon's) mauner, he would have communicated it to him. He added, with respect to the evidence he gave before the Commissioners, that there was an obvious want of improvement in the mode of communication with the different departments of the army, and especially between the army and its own transports, and he gave the Commissioners the information he had done to show that certain imnrovements were necessary in those respects; but it was perhaps impolitic on the part of the Commissioners to publish it. (A ]augh.) In reply to the JUG1E-A:ovOcArE-GmENmnAs, Colonel Gordon admitted thatthe evidence he gave before the Commissioners was not printed in their report until after it had been sent by them to him for his approval and correction, and until after he had returned it to them, and that when he returned it to them it contained the passage which he had just said it was perhaps impolitic in the Com3nissioners to publish. But, e a ded, he was not then aware that the report was to be published, and that he .thou-ht it was to be laid before Lord Panmure. Colonel M'Kenzie was recalled by Colonel Gordon, and bore testimonyto the inconvenience which -was felt in-the Qnartermaster-General'sdepartment, andto the detention of sick and wounded officers on the beach, from the difficulty of communicating with Captain Heath. He added that he had seen anofficer lying on a stretcher in the mudwaiting for an order ir-be'conveyed on board a transport, and that the delay a-ose from the diffitultv of getting the signaturze of Captain Heath or his secretary to the order. Captain Heath said, there was no necessity for the order to be signed by him with a view to an officer being received on board an hospital ship. Colonel 31'Xeuzie was zecalled at a subsequent part of the sitting, and asked by Captain Heath if he could remermber the date when he saw an oflicer lying on the beach in the mud, for he (Captain Heath) anived at Balaldava on the 1st of April, 1856, and left on the 10th of November in the same year, and during that interval there was no mud? He had no doubt such a circumstance happened in winter,. but he wished Colonel MlKenzie to state the time when it occurred. Colonel M'Kenzie said, he could not call to mind any particular time. The wounded officer in question, he added, in reply to General BERKELEY, was put down on the wharf on a stretcher, and had to lie there until he could get an order from Captain HIeath to go on board a transport. But that was not the only case of that kind he had seen; he had seen at least half-a-dozen officers sometimes lyinlg iaLthe mud on stretchers. In reply to Captain Heath, Colonel MlKenzie said he could not furnsh the date when that circumstance happened. The JUDGE-A_VOCATE-GENERAL reminded Mr. Commissary-General FlYder that in his evidence on the 15th inst., before the board, he drew their attention to the circumstance of Sir Charles Trevelvan having put togethertwo sentences of a letter written by Mr. l?der tohimn (Sir C. Trevelyan) in October, 1854, which had no necessary connemion, in order to make it appear that Mr. Filder had at that time an ample supply of forage in store, which was not the fact. Mr. Filder, in his evidence before the board on the 15th, pointed oit that in that letter he was referring to other stores, and not to fora"e. Sir C. Trevelyan, in reply to that, wis;ed to ask Mr. Filder what he meant by stores when he was making requisitions to the Treaswy ? Sir Charles thought he must have included hay when he referred to stores in the letter of October. la. Filder said, in the first paragraph of the letter in' question, he thought he had disposed of the question of hay by showing thit it was not in sufficient quantity; but the second paragraph referred to other stores, for which he did not make requisitions, because he believed those at his command ample for.the emergeucy. Sir Charles Trevelyan, however, had. put. the two paragraphs together in order to prove that he (Mr. Fildei) was satisfied with the quantity of hay which he had then got, notwithstanding that he wrotle by the next mail another letter to Sir Charles distinctly asking for hay. He submitted, therefore, that there could be no misapprehension as to the meaning of his requisitions to the Treasury. The JiiDGE-ADVOCATE-GEEXRAL, at this stage of the proceedings, in reply to a question from the INresident, stated there were no more wvitnesses to call, and that no other person who felt aggrieved by the Commissioners' report had applied to be heard before the board. The PREusnESr said, under those circumstances the board wvould adjoum,.and they wished to say-to the shorthand-writer (r. ill) that his services would not be farther required, and that they were highly satisfied with the -manner in which' he. hadi dischar~ged his dulies. - 'Thb 'board then' adlorn'ed at 20 minutes to'3-o'clock, and so ended the investigation, which had lasted 23 days.
.ELANXD. - - (FROM OIL oWN cOBRolPDaE J.) - DUBLIN, IOEDAY MORNns. HE TIPPERA;Y B5ANX CON-MIBTOE.MS. The war of words still rages in Master Murphls office. Saturday was occupied with the cases of Mr. Wilson Kennedy and Mxr. Vincent Scully, and at the conclusion of the arguments the Master intimated that his judgment with respect to those gentlemen's claims for exemption would be preparei by Monday (this-day). It is said that in the event of judgment being given against the English share holders, the parties are prepared to appeal, first to the Court of Chancery, and, if imsuccessful there, then to bring the matter before the highest tribunal in the empire. Altogether the prospects of ,the creditors do not improve, and everything denotes the certainty of a long day before-a sixpence shaJ be touched in the way of a dividend. : JOHN SADLEm'S ASSETS. The Freeman of this morning has a stateknent-to the effect that the Crown, on the memorial of creditors to the extent of 250,000i., has agreed:to appoint Mr. Anthony Norris,. of Bedford-row., London, and one of the creditors, to be adis; trator for collecting in the assets of the late Job} Sadleir. Mr. Norris has consented to act limder the authority of the Crown, and will lose no t in6ic reaizing for the benefit of the unhappy cfeditors large sum stated to have been invested by ;e suicide in various securities both at home oien abroad. This step will perhaps affofa a solution to the prevailing mystery with respect to the disposal by the deceased of the gigantic funds resli7d. inthe course of his successfu career of fraud. (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAIL) - DUEBLtN, MO-DAY -Evm.-nG. TIFPERArgY BzAiX.-i oETAwT JUDG-iT. MIr. IURPHY gave judgment this day on. the~ applications made by Mr. Wilson Kennedy andMr. Vincent Scully, Q.C., M.P., to be removedfronx the list of persons liable to the liquidation of the liabilities of this concern. The Master stated at considerable length lIr. Wilson Kennedy's positiorn in respect to the bank, his directorship, for which he was entitled to a salary of 5001. &year,andthe importance and responsibility of the-duties attaced. to that 6ffice, which he held down to the date of thetransfer, and, after recapitulating the law of equity as argued at the bar, said that the case must be determined by the deed of co-partnershi. Ms clearopinion was that what was done by 3ir. Kennedy was not what he ought to have done, was not what. he was justified in doing, and he shoulcd thereforestand upon the list asa contributory. Mr. Tincent Scully was differently circumstanced. He wasplaeed on the list in the.same position as Mr. Kennedy, but with a much larger amount of liability-namely, as a holder of 700 shares. Although he (theMaster) had said there were features -which distinguished the two cases, yet really Mr. Scully and Mr. Kennedy. stood in the same position. It appeared to him that Mr. Scully was held out constructively to the publicas a director of the bank, yet getting no court of directors to meet and doing everything to give validity to the transfer of his shares. Hemust have had knowledge of the informality connected with that transfer, and he was possessed of the knowledge which prompted him to sell out. He (the Master)apprehended, then, that Mr. Scully's application could not be sustained inn coulrt of justice. He wa3t$he honest bond fide holder of the shares, and. his name must therefore remain on the list without qualification. It is understood that this judgment. willbe appealed against to the Mfaster bf the Roll&. Cors, MoNDAY MonRNncT. DDRnADFUL ACC]DENT AND LOSS OF L . - A dreadful accident occurred on board the Nimrod steamer, from Liverpool, which arrived this moming at 5 o'clock at the Quay, Cork. As she wasswinging round an explosion was heard on deck, and a dense cloud of smoke was seen to issue from the engine-room, where were found sixn men lying in various parts of the roonm. The bodies presented a fearful appearance -when. brought on deck. One was found dead, and Rheothers in a dying condition. Two died immediately. Three more were removed to the North Ilnfinuay, where they soon afterwards expired. t The accident was caused by the bursting of theboiler.
