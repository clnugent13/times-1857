PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIaGFCE. flOfUSE OF LORDS, TUESDAY, FM. 19. The LoaD CzzcEiLort took his seat on the woolsack at 0 'lock, PETITIONS. l Th. EArl of SHAFIESBURY presented petitions agsinst9eotening of tbe Csta2lPalsceasdlBritish Musnronthe laordvseday from the tesleyan infoun Chane, Primstone erneym Strensal, the clergy, &c. of theparianof Bani2ton,the chapseryf Penley, the *Vesleyans in Atherstone, GreatwWre,aathe Indepcndent chapel at Battersley-Ensor - tron to *orkrs n leachwvorks of South Arthurlie, for]| gesct restrain incensed pawnbrokers in Scotland;- and ;from Strensall, in favour of church-rates. THEE WENSLEYDALE PEERAGE. E-ar GREY said, -I beg to give notice that on Friday I 'ball move an amendment on the motion of which notice aas been given by the noble and learned lord (Lyndhurst) to leave out all the words after the wrord "opinion" for the purpose of inserting these words:- "That thehighest legalauthorities having concurred in ileclaring the Crown to possess the power of creating peer. ag for life, and this power having in some eases, been exerxcised in former times, the House of Lords would not be 3ustifled in assuming the illegality of the patent creatinrthe Bight Hon. James Parke Baron Wensleydale forlife, and in refusing unon that assumption to permit him to take Ulsseat as a peer.' If the above amendment should be agreed to by the com2nittee, then I will move the following additional resolutions "1L That, although several grants of peerages for life we recorded to have been made m favour of females up to a comparatively recent period, no precedent has been found within the last 400 years for the admission of a com- aoner to the House of Lords by the grant of a peerage for life. 2. That the grant of a peerage for life to Lord Sens. leydale being thus unsupported by any recent precedent; it is expedient that the House should declare its opinibn that as a general nile Her Majesty ought not to be advised to :nake use, without the consent of Parliament, of any of the 3prerogatives which may still in strict law belong to the Crown, but which cannot be shown to have been exercised except in remote periods of our history when the constitution was in many respects unmsettled. Biut that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Hiouse in declaring this opinion may properly abstain from expressing dispprobation of the conduct of Her hIajesty's confidential !ervants in advising the grant of a peerage to Lord Wensleydale for life. 3. That the grant of peerages forlife might in some cases be of advantageboth to the House of Lords and to the public, but that the practice of granting such peerages would be peculiarly liable to abuse unless guarded by some precautionary regulations. 4. That it will require further and mature consideration to determine wLat steps it will be proper for the House to adopt in order toprevent the patent granted to Lord Wensleyd.le from being drawn into a precedent in favour of creating peerages for life, and in order oestablish adequate securities against abuse if such creations are hereafter to take place." Lord BROUGHAM.-1Ill the noble earl state what mneans he proposes? Earl GREY.-I do not know. THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. The Earl of DERBY gavenotice that on Thursday ho a-ould put a question to Her Majesty's Government, with the view to ascertain the respective duties and responsibilities attaching to the offices of Secretary of State for the War Department and Commander-in-Chief, and that he should move for the production of any document in which those duties were limited or defined. THE COhMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES. Mr. W. Smith appeared at the bar and handed in the -Journals of the House of the year 1692, containin- entries Xelating to the Earl of Lincoln's writ and patent. V1CE-PRESIDENT OF COMMITTEE OF COUNCI ON EDUCATION BILL. In moving the third reading of this bill, Earl GRA±NVILLE explained that, in attributing on a former evening to Sir J. Pakington the sum-estion of the present measure, he did not mean to itnplylthat that right ton. geitleman had been the originalyro oser of aMinistry of Education. No doubt Mr. Ewart im the other house. and the noble and learned lord on the cross benches (Broughanm) had previously proposed a similar scheme. What he intended upon the former evening was to acknowledge the efforts of Sir J. Palington in the cause of education kst sear. Lord BROUGIAh:cordially recognized the enminent services of Sir J. Pakington in that and many other matters. The bill was then read a third time and passed. The House of Commons Offices Bill and the Metropolitan Police Bill were severally read a third time and passed. THE SUNKEN SEIIPS IN SEBASTOPOL HARBOUR. The Earl of HARDWICKE begged to caU their lordships' attention to a subject of considerable importance to the country and to the House, and over which they could only exercise a distant and moderate controL At the commenceuent of the war with Russia the authorities at Sebastopol, in order to provide for the defence of that port, tlought proper to sink- seven, eight, or nine-he was not sure of the asu-ber-heavy ships. The state in which those ships 'Were sun- he beleved was not known to any one. Whether they were sunk- with their stores or guns on board, or other. wise, no one Inew; nor whether they were built of oak or .if fir. He rather believed they were bult of Oak, judging from the abundance of that kind of timber in those countries. He felt sure the Government would agree that if at the close of the war there should be a resurrection of those ships very great pain and irritation would be felt by the people of this country, vwho firmly ;c5ieved that the Russian Black- Sea fleet had been utterly and completely destroyed. He therefore ventured to call the attention of the Ilouse and of the Government to the snbject, believing, as he did, although he had heard it stated that those ships lay under the firefrom the northern forts, that science could still find some means for effectually destroying those vessels. For himself he would express no opinion, but, as Sir E. Lyons was about to depart to renew Ins coummand, he (Lord HardwicLe) caled the attention of the Government to this important matter. It was well known that operations could be carried on under water with almost as reat facility as regarded the p reservation of life has upon lad, although, of course, with less rapidity. HIe ap~prehended that possessing, as the aDlies did, the southern aide of the harbour, operations of the nature to which he tad referred could be carried on. L,ord PANMURE said, the noble ealrl had assumed that ---hich wras not entirely the case with respect to our posses. sion of the harbour of SebastopoL Operations of the kind suggested by the noble earl could not be undertaken in the daytinse without the certainty of exposing our men to the fire of the Russian guns in the northern forts. With respect to the general question to which the noble earl had called attention, he (LordPanmure) could assure him that not only now, but ever since the south side of Sebastopol had fallen into the hands of the allies, they had lost no opportunity of destroying, as far as lay in their power, every. thing that could he applied at any future time to the reconstruction of the naval and military establishmnents at Sebastopol It was only yesterday that a despatch 'was received from Sir W. Codnngton, announcing the final destruction by our allies of Fort St. N-icholas. He felt assured the country could rely upon the zeal and energy of Sir E. yosan would ho satssfedthat, as far as it mi"tlie in his power to prevent any resurrection of the RussYlan Black Sea Beet, no opportunity would be lost in accomplishing all that science and galantry could effect for the destruction of othose ships, whether under the water or above it. Their lordshipr then adJourned at half-past 5 o'clock.

PERRY said, he had been informed that no lon. member could move that a petition be printed with the votes until the printing committee had declined to print it. But he wished to ask the right hon. gentleman in the chair whether under urget circumstances, when the subject was very shortly comig before the House, it was not con petent fora meember to move that the petition be forthwithprinted with the votes. The SPEAKIE-Three years agoarule was adopted that no hon. member was entitled to move that a Petition be printed with the votes until the printing committee declined to print it. Until the committee so decline it is not competent for the hon. member to make that motion. Sir E. PERRY then presented a petition from the son-inlaw of the late Nawab of Surat, complaining of the manner in which the East India Company had dealt with the inheritance of the Nawab, and praying inquiry and redress, rne petition was ordered to lia upon the table. THE BALTIC FLEET. Sir C. NAPPIER gave notice that on the 4th of March he would move for a committee to inquire into the operations zOf the British Baltic fleet in 184 and 1855. BANK CHARTER ACT. M1r. H. B^AMLLIE asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer i v,ether, in the event of the Government deciding to renew the Bank Charter Act for another term of years, he would be prapared to introduce a clause to continue in force the arrangement by which the Bak of England aWreed to may to those private banks which consented to withdraw their paper circulation one-per cent. per annum upon the average ismue of those banks in the three previous years, mid to continuie the came so long as the other privfLte bankts were permitted to iue their paper ?

Mr. PEEL said that the noble lord, in puttinghis question, had overlooked the fact that the commissioners hadmade two reports; and the report which principally concerned the Horse Guards was dated London, and therefore could not have arrived in this country, for it was made in England. - The first report was sent by the commissioners to the War' Department in June last, not in the form in which it now appeared with the tables inserted, or with any evidence oz returns attached to the report, but ina less complete form, for the information of Lord Panmure. That report was not, he understood, communicated to Lord Iardinge, inas much as it concerned a branch of the military administtion which was entirely tnder the control of the War. Department-namely, the commissariat. The second report - along with the evidence and appendices, was prepared and. printed by the commissioners; and it vwa completed in January in the present year. It was submitted to Lord Pan. miure in the latter end of that month ; and that noblo lord immediately gave directions that its publication should be proceeded with, and it was dishibuted withoutloss of time. The interval between its being seen by Lord Panmure and Lord Hardinge must have been very short indeed; in fact, it could not be said that there was anything like an endeavour to withhold it from the Horse Guards. Colonel NORTIL-I shorld like to know fronrthe hon. Under-Secretary whether the document on the table zontains the whole report of these commissioners (hear, hear), and, if not, vhetherthere is any intention on the part of the Government of laying the whole report before the House? Mr. PEEL-There is no intention of submitting the report in any other form than that in which it is at present before the House. Mr. ROEBUCK.-I must point out to the hon. gentleman that that is no answer to the question put to him. (Hear.) Colonel NORTH gave notice that he should renew the question to-morrow in the hope of then getting an answer. (Hear, hear.) AAAGEMIENT OF THE ADMnRLTY. - Sir C. NAPIER asked whether there was any objection to lay before the House the evidence taken before a committee appointed to inquire as to the best mode of securing i more efficient management of the Admiralty ? Sir x' WOOD said, there had been a committee of the Lords of the Admiralty and the Secretary of the Admiralty appointed to inquire into some of the details of the manage. ment of the Admiralty, but it was not the sort of inquiry which was usually laid before that House. Sir C. NAPIER.-Has there been a report? Sir C. WOOD said, there had beenareport, but it related chiefly to the question of whether papers should be registered or numbered. (A laugh.) Sir C. NAPIER.-That's just what I want to know. THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MASTERS AND WORKMEN. Mr. MACIHNNON, who was indistinctly heard, rose fo move for the appointment of a select committee to consider the inconvenience now felt in the coLntry from the want of equitable tribunals bymeans of which any difference between masters and operatives might be satisfactorily adjustedc; and also, to ascertain whether the comeiRs des prucPeonenizs in France had answered the purpose for which they were established. The conweis des prm-nP'oss7ses were councils composed partly of masters and partly of operatives, with a | president and vice-president appointed by the Govermuent, to whom were referred aU questions which arose between masters and men, and great disatisfaction existed at the present moment in this country in consequence of the wanut of some such tribunaL In all the manufacturing towns the chief manufacturers were generally justices of th7e peace, and, let their judgments in disputes between masters and menbe ever so jnst and equitable, the work-men viewed themwith prejudice, as judgments given by persons who were connected by the ties either of friendship or of common interest with their employers. In the course of the last week-he had had an interview with a numerous body of persons belonging to the Association of the Trades of London. This associstion represented 40,000 operatives in London and he had been informed by it that the workmen were dissatisfied with the present state of the lawv. They considered that there was no fair tribunal for the settlement of their disputes with their masters; and further urged that even if the decision of a magistrate were fair, the obtainingof it was not unattended by expense. He did not ask for the establishment of tribunals precisely similar to those which existed in France ; aU he sought was to obtain a committee,to be composed chiefly of master manufacturers and gentlemen who had turned their attention to this subject,which should iquire into the matter and decide whether or not such equitable tribunals would or wocld notbenefit this country. Bo had seen a list of the grievances of printers, tailors, joiners, compositors, and workmen in other trades, all of whom were anxions that the law on this subject should be amended. If the committee were appointed, persons engaged in these trades might be examined, their complaints would be heard, and the committee might then determine what would be the best course to pusue, and leave it to Her Mae,ys: Government. or some other person, to carry out their recommendations. It was of the gre.atest importance to avoid, if possible, the recurrence of strikes Bein connected with Lancashire as a coalowner, he could speak to the great loss which had been occasioned by the strikes of the miners near Wigan. The ownerhadlost his royalty, the man who worked the mine his capital, and the workman his wages, and the result had been no benefit to any one, but an immense loss to all. Inall probability we should, before this year was ended, have "pniping times of peace," and it wvas in such times, rather thian in those of war, that persons were likely to find fault with the Government and the institutions of the country, Let theHouse, therefore, be cautious how it gave the working classes any reason to turn against them. When peace was made many grievances would be pressed upon the attention of Parliament, and there would be many applications for theamendmentofthelaw. Alargenumber of individuals of education and ability would be thrown out of employ. ment, whose poverty would tell them that they had nothing to lose, whose vanity that they had aU to gain, and who would give not a little trouble to any Government which might be in power. Was it not the duty of the House to guard against such a result, and would [not one of the best securities against it be to satisfy the lower classes by giving them equitable tribunals to decide between themselves and their employers? How did a strike arise ? The operatives met, agreed that they were ill-used, and determined that they must have an increase of wages, say of 2s. or 3s. a-week. The masters, getting excited, also met, and determined that they would not grant the request. Every one knew that if two individuals became excited or exasperated they were often not fair to each other. If this applied to individuals, it applied with tenfoldforce tobodies of men. The operatives, an uneducated body of men, became excasperated against their masters, and, havinig determined not towork, suffered the sreatesthardships. The masters, although better educated, folowaed precisely the same course, and refused in the slightest degree to hte way to the men. Thme result was afendwhich was equallymnjurious to both. Suppose that therewas established in this country an equitable tribunal composed of an equal number of masters and workmnen, with a master or aperson appseinted by the executive Government as its chairman. In that case the operatives might appear by representatives as counsel, and might explain tothis ttibunal how they were situated ; that provisions were dear, that their work was very hard, and that they were obliged to ask for an increase of wages. The masters would then talk quietly with the representatives of the men ; probably a moderate concession would be made by each side, and perfect good feeling would be restored. As the law now stood, it was impossible to obtain such a result. He was not anxious for any particular form of tribu.- nal, nor did he seek to give it power to fix rnaximum or asinimaina rates of wages; aU he sought was the establishment of equitable tribunals, which should be able to reconcile masters and workmen, and to prevent the recu-rence of so tremendous a misfortune as a stike. He thought he was not asking too much in prposing tho appointment of a committee to consider whether something could not be done to effect this object. All he wished was, that 15 gentlemen should examine the subject to see what they could do. He saw no objection to the appointment of sueh a committee. It could damage no one except hi hon. ana learned friend the Attorney-General and others of the same profession, whose business might be diminished by the estabhshment of such tribunals as he sought for; and he therefore begged to move-" That a select committee ba appointed to mquireinto and consider the propriety of estabn shig equitable tribunals for the amicable adjustment of differences between masters and operatives." The motion having been seconded, Sir G. GREY said that, when the hon. gentleman on a former occasion moved for a committee to inquire ito the functions of conse des prudhommes, he objected to its appointment, because he thought that such information could be obtained without the intervention of a committee. He (Sir G. Grey) then undertook to obtain full information as to the functions of these tribunals. With the assistance of the Board of Trade he obtained that information, and it was laid upon the table of the house. His hen. friend after. wards gave notice of his intention to move for a committee toinqure intothe operation ofthese conssls dcsprzdc'hom7nie. He (Sir G. Grey) did not think that the House could -have appointed a committee to inquire into that subject. His hon. friend had, hoaver, judiciously modified the terms of his motion; and he now understood that he asked for a committee to inquire only into the expediency of establishing tribunals analogous to these conselus des ps'omes for the settlement of differencas between masters and workmen. He (Sir G. Grey) thought there could be no objection to such an iniry, provided it were undertaken with a full knowledge of what these con-eise des pmumdmommes were. (Hear, hear.) He was afraid, from the speech of the hon. gentleman, that he had not profited so much as he might by the information which hadbeen laid upon the table, and that he ?ssemed to contemplate that these tribunals would have power to settle disputesbetween masters and workmen as to the rate of wages. Having attentively perused the papers upon the table, he (Sir G. Grey) would state -what were the functions of the coea7s des jn'mshommes. . They were fof two kiuids, administrative and judicial. The judicial. functions were confined to the decision of questions relating to subjects which were already matters of contract between nmaters and workmen,, and bad nothing to do with the makig of' contracts between them. The -only questions 0n w.high theso tribunsig Md power to do- dde were such as iarose' upon- prowexisting - w .tsra Itsnightbe desirabletoestabih intlascountry tribunals empowered to dealwith questionaalogous-to those wSich-commonly engaged the-attention of the conseilt des prw'hommaex -.inFranoe, rut he would warnthe hon. member againsttthe delusion of suppodingthxt it wa Possible, througha th intexventious of anytribunial, or at a otherwise than by agree --ment between the parties,-to regulate the amnount of wages toobe'paidbyumastersto theiroperatives. (Hear,-l6ar.) If the hon. memberwas of opinion that any practical goodwas likely to result from the motion the Government would not oppose it. (Hear, hear.) Mr. IACK1N1ON explained that it was not intended that tho tribunals should fLx a maximum of wages. Their great duty would be to promote Idnd feelings and amicable relations between the employers and the employed. (Hear, bear.) - - t MIr. WILKNSON thought that it would conduce to the interests of all parties that there should be tribunals which; though not empowered .to pronounce authoritativo deciaions, might yet be qualified to give xdvice, pronoance opinions, and generally to act such a mediatorial parit as might tend to mitigate. the bitter antagonsm of classes. (Hear, hear.) Tho motion was then agreed to. REVISION OF TEIE STATbT.E. Ir. L. KING moved "that there be prepared, under the direction of the Clerk of the Parliaments, an edition -of the statutes at large for the us of this House, inclidinig all public general statutes and parts of statutes in force,-and omitting all such statutes and parts of statutes'as are expired, or have been expressly repealed; and that, iti the place of the statutes-or parts of statutes repealed, thereibe ;nseried the titles of the statutes repealed, the respective numbers and abstracts of the clauses repealed, with a reference in the margin to the statutes by which they are repealed." The hon. member said that, on previous occasions and in various forms, he had endeavoured to call the attention of the Houso to this important subject, and ho was happy to say -that, dry as the question was, it was now beeoming to a certain degreo popular. It had awakened the interest of many thinldng men, who perceived how desirable it was that the living iaw should be presented in an accessible form, and extricated from the vast mass of dead matter with which it was encumbered. (Hear.) When, on a former occasion, he s6bmitted aproposalhaving simplyfor itsobject the compilation of such an edition of the statutes as would make the law more accessible and more intelligible to the country -he was strenuously opposed by the Government ; and, in consequence gf the great activity displayed by the Secretary of the Treasury, in enticing into the house at a late hour of night a number of members some of whom knew little or nothing of the resolution under discussion, he was defeated by a majority of nine. Feeling, however, that the judgnient which the House had pronouneed was a vote against a great truth and a great fact, he subsequently introduced another resolution for which, remembering that it embodied the very words used on this subject by the Lord Chancellor in 1853, he anticipated a more favourable reception on the part of the Government. The nestion attracted the attention of the Statute ULaw Commissioners before the close of Ithe session; and during the recess it was taken up in a very zealoulsspirit by the Societ;yfor thekAmendmentof the Law. That society appointed for the consideration of the subject a special committee, of which he was proud to say that he was chairmnan. It comprised the names of many able and energetic lawyers, and amuongothers that of Mr. Pitt Taylor, an enthusiast in the cause of law reform. From the report of that committee he would read one or two passages, which seemed especially worthy of attentive consideration:- "In any'systematic attempt to consolidate the statute law, the very frst step which obviously ought to be taken is to ascertain,with asmuch precision as possible, howimuch of that law is still in force." (Hear.) In another place the report went on to say that an edi'ion, as he advocated, " Would vastly facilitate any measures which might afterwards be taken for the consolidation of the statutelaw. Nor would the advantages derivable fromn this work be confined to the legislator, for the judge who has to administber the law, the counsel or attorney who has to advise upon the law, and the subject who h3s to obey the law, would at least be equnlly benefitted, and this in two ways-first, the labour of ascertainmngwhat the written law enacts upon: any particular subject would be lightened, not only in proportion to the dimnmished bulk of the -statutc-book--whuch would probablybe reduced by the process from 40 quarto tomes to 10 or 12 octavo volumes--but also in proportion to the number of margIal references." (Hear, hear.) The learned men who composed the committee saw no such great difficulty in the execution of this task. They even contrived-among themselves a plan for the expurgation of the statute-book,which proceeded on the principle of taking one reign at a time; and they would have persevered in the work, were it not that they feared that if the Government should not sanction the project their labour would be in vain. Their scheme was, m effect, that proposed by Lord Bacon, who desired first to clear away from the statute-book all repealed statutes, and then to remove all obsolete ones. The Law Amendment Society also agreed unaniimously to a resolution couched in these words- " That the pubEcation of a revised and authorized edition of the public general acts now in force should be the finr-t step taken towards the consolidation of the statute law." The progress of time did but aggravate the evils of the present system. Durin the 22 years of the reign of James I there were passed only 134 public and 168 private acts. Now, our legislation roceeded at the rate of some 41)0 or 500 statutes a-year. (Hear.) Lord Bacon complained, 200 years ago, that "the living died in the arms of the dead,' and that 'the laws were as complicated and cncumbered that "neither common people could practise them, nor lawyers sufficiently understand them." (Hear, hear.) Sir 1E Coke, who lived about the same time, expressed a similar opinion, declaring that it was most desirable- " To omit all thosc (laws) that be repealed, that none by them be deceived . . . . To make one plain and perspicuous law, dividedinto articles, so that every subject may know what acts be in force and what repealed, either by particular or general words, in part or in the whole; or what branches and parts abridged, what enlarged, what expounded, so as each man may clearly know what and how much of thiem is in force, and how to obey them. It were a necessary work, and worthy of singular commendation." Lord Harawicke speaking more recently-100 years agouttered theseremarkable sentiments " Oer statute-books have of late increased to such an enormous size that no lawyer, not even one of the largest and most extensive practice, can pretend to be master of all the statutes that relate to any one case that comes before him: and this evil goes on increasing so much every year that it is high time for this House to begin to put a stop to it."1 (Hear.) At that time thereware onlysix quarto volumes of statutes; now therewere 40. (Hear.) Since Lord Hardwicke complained of the accumulation of our laws there had been added in the reign of George m. 6,as3; in that of George IV., 1,060; in that of Wiliam IV., 678; and during the first 16 years of that of Queen Victoria, 1,8G4; making in a.ll10,561 statutes since thetime of Lord Hardw.cke. (Hear, hear.) Were lawyers and legislators in modern days so much superiorto those of bygone ages that they could afford to disregard difficulties which awakened the apprehension of such men as Bacon, Coke, and Hardwicke? Hewould nowcoinetotheopinionexpressedon this subjectby the present Lord Chancellor as recently as February, 1855. The following were the Lord Chance'lor's words:- " "The first process will be to ascertain precisely the text of the statute law as it now exists by determining what statutes have been repealed (expressly or virtually), what have expired, and what have becomne obsolete or unnecessary in the present state of society." The LrdChancellor, complainingof theformof thestatate; on the 14th of February,1853, said:- "They are aU in the most repulsive form; there is no classification, butthey are huddled together in the most complex fashion. The judges are supposed to beacquaintel with all law; but no human mind could master them. .. Knowledge of them is impossible, and, therefore, ignorance has ceased to be a disgrace." Again, the Attorney-General only the other night said that "in,, his judgment the best plan would be to sweep awayaUl the statutes or parts of statutes which had been repealed, and then proceed to consolidate what remained" And here he would perhaps, be allowed to quote an extract from the leading journal, which met this case exactly. In a recent article lVic Times said:-. "The indispensable requisite, then, to a consolidation of the statutes is that we should devise some exhaustive principle of division by which our labours may be economized and directed; but, in order to do tbis, we cannot but think it would be necessary clearly to ascertain and carefully to discriminate the sabject-matter with which we have to deaL The statute-boolc ounLt.ia, a we nhowed on a former occasn, an enormous mass of private, local and personal, obsolete, expired, repealed, and partiaUy repealed acts, which obscure our view and impede the justice of our conclusions." The words that immediately foUowed ought to be particnlarly attended to:- " We must clear awway the rabbish before we can ascertain the ground plan and elevation of the edifice. In order that we may divide wo must distiguish, and in order that we may distinguish we must fully an.d completely compre hend. For these reasons, without at all nretendim; to deny the force of anythialgthat was said in tfielate debate, we take the liberty of adding to it our suggestion of the absoluLte necessity that, as before we begin to codify we should consolidate, before we begin to consolidate we should divide, so before we divide we should carefnUly clear away and expurgate.'- He regretted to have to weary the louse with these extraets, but he would only read, one more, which appeared in a pamphlet written two years ago by an eminent Queen's counsel, Mr. Graham Wilmore, which gave an excellent insight into what the statute-book really consisted of. The pamphlet, which bore the appropriate title of: Confusion 2corse Confounded, in describing our statuta law, said:- " It resembles some gigantia, deep, roomy, patched, wormeaten, old-fashioned chest, perforated with drawers,' pigeonholes, corners, and other places of repository"a-id concealment, stuffed full of a heterogeneous medley of every kind of. matters concealed and confused with mould, cobwebs, dust, and rubbish, where whoever wishes to procure any-- thing in haste has to ge frantically 3c'out, opcening, shutting, .diying,groping, rummaging into every'place,often failing in his seas-oh and, even if ho succeeds, alwa ys doubtinag whether he has founid all that he wants.- In sober fact, the printed statutes-public statutes alone-uptothe end of the session in 1851 inclusive consist of 38 quarto 'volumes, amounting to 221:b. avoirdupois weight, and eontaining 3Z00N3 pages." - "-, - Since tat was written two volumes of new- statutee -ox- tending over 2,000 pages, had been adaed. 'The example of what had been done- wRith- the written law 'in France h-Aa besfreqnently referred- to. Suffice it, therefore, to say that the Wreh code was compressed -within the compass of a single pocket volumie, whIch sould bo bought for as low axm as'd. ;-ori amuch handsomerAditionwapreferrl, |itcould&be had for U1. _This contrasted very strongly with The published prioe of our stauti' wide amounted to' something like 1001. It would be' said, however, that France, being a despotic conutry, offered'no atalog to En - n-d onisuch aquestiAn. The case of 'the New w ork odZ e might thereforbe mboroinpoint. On that'partof the iub, ject Lord Lyndhurst bad-observed:- I' "In some ikiaces thceactsof otaTranatlanticbreth,ir would seem to' jusify t4e belief thatmen, like plants, aquire freshvigour from being transplanted. In the state of Nev York all our statutes, upto the time- of the declaration of independenee, Were infore. Fothat period ther hadbeen an immense accumulation of. statutes, arising out of their ncw position. The inhabitants of New York were in the same unfortunate position as ourselves in this respect, but they resolved to get rid'of the' evil; and in 1835 competerit persons were appointed to revisc'aud consolidate the statutes,. In two y'exrsfrom that time the object *aw accomplished, and in a manuer quite satisfactory not only tothe legalprofeesion, but to the general publi of that Stsa"e -.-* ,'-' W.hat was there to hinder us fronadoing what had been accomplished under- greater difficulties- than we should-have to encounter in the State of New York. The Government, however, despaired of beinag able to do the work, the Statute Law Clommiassion also failed' to do it, Mr. Bellenden Ner, one of the leadingconaissiosers, appearing to argue against and to reject the instructions of the Lord Chanoellor, his chief. In this state of things, he (r. L. King) thereforeproposed that an editon of the sttutes should be prepared, which, although it would not at first be authentic, would soon practicaly become so, after it had been subiected to correction ypractice. He recommended that this work should be done by the- Clerk of the Parliinents, who' was knowntobea gentleman 'of indefatigable industry, who delihted in beig usefully employed. The task assigned to liS officer would not be a very'difficut one, because in the library of the IHouse of Lords there already existed an index to the statutes from 1801 down to 1852, together with a list of repealed statutes. Availing himself of these facilities, as.wet as of the labours of Messr Anstey and Rogers, the whole body of the living statute law might be speedily reduced by this officer within the compass of 10 moderatesized volumnes. The execution of the great work of law reform would add to the popularity of any Government, and serve to render illustrious in atter times the reign of Her present Majesty. The great Napoleon, after subjupting to his imperial sway the larger portion of the civilized globe, looked uponbhis mnilitary conquests as insignificant in earmparsonwath the fametobe wonbythe accomplisbment of apteaceful improvement such as that to which this motion referred, and gave utterance to his noble sentiments on this subject in the memorable words,-" I shall go down to posterity with this code in my hand." Whatever victories this country mnightbe destined to achieve, no victory could be greaterthanthat which should make justice triumphant over injustice. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman concluded byamaking his motion. Mr. W. EWART, in seconding the resolution,' confessed his doubts whether the Clerk of the Parliaments would be adequate, single-handed, for the execution of the work which it would impose npen him; and also expressed a desire that the edition of the statutes proposed to be prepared should be adapted not only for the use of that House, but for that of the general pub lc. With those exceptions, he entirely concurred in the views of the hon. mover. If the system of codification-was to be adopted,theyoughttobegin it with the statute law. Thelanguageof their current legislation had been cleared from many vain and idle repetitions which marked their older statutes; but there still remained a great deal of useless verbiage to be also expanged. The commission which had been appointed for the consolidation of the statute law consisted of a number of gentlemen of high station aLnd character, and of extensive legal acousre. ments, including the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of 3tate for the HlomeDepartment, the Attorney-Ceneral,'tbe Solicitor-General, and other high legal authorities, but the greater number of these gentlemen found it impossiMle to devote their time and talents to the consideration of this subject. In his opinion, the proper course would be to appoint paid commissioners, whlo could devote their undivided attention to the duties they were required to discharge. It was said that anys new edition of the statutes -would be liable to objection, and would require amendment. That might be true, and the inconvenience had been experienced in New York when a codification' of the law took place ; but, although there 'were faults in the first edition, that edition had been revised and corrected, and the result was that a collection of statutes had been published npon which full reliance might be placed. He had read not long ago a report, draxan aap by a Frenchman, upon the comparative merits o the French and English law, and the writer observed that, although 20 years' study was necessary to acquiro a thorough knowledge of English law, a nerson of reasonable abilities might master the French law in three years. He hoped the time would speedily arrive when that codification of the statute law of this country would render its study equally easy, but be despaired of the accomplishment of this object until a Minister of Justice was appointed, who would devote his attention to important legal reforms, and would overrule and guide the proceedings of the commissioners. The ATTORNEY-GRN1ERAL did not propose to follow the hon. and learned member for Durnfries in his observations with reference to the appointment of a Minister o' Justice and the genc-al question of the consolidation of the statutes, for those subjects were entirely foreign to the reso lution. He niust say that he hoped the hon. member for East Surrey, in aany of whose opinions he fully concurred, wkould not think it necessary to press his motion to a division. The hon. gentleman must be aware that the work contemplated by his resolution was one of a very important ani egsti5a Itro,vr. IC was not only a work of very great time and labour, but it was one that could not be perfonned mechanically. It diI not involve the' mere excision from the statute-bookof those statutes which had been partially oi entirely repealed, but it was a work that could only be performed by a person who pq,sessed great legal knowledge, and who was thoroughly acqilited with the subject. Could it be assumed thatagentleman whose~ time wras already sO fully occupied as that of the Clerk of the Parliaments would be competent to undertake a duty of this important and extensivenature ? There was, however, another ground of objectionto the motion, which called upon the HIouse to resolve that an edition of the statutes should be prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments for the use of that lIoue. Now the Clerk of the Parliaments was not an officer of that House, but the only person properly designated by such a title was an officer of the House of. Lords, and he did not think that Honse could-direct an officer of the other House to prepare an edition of the statutes fortheir use. This appeared to bin an insuperable objection to the motion;* but, however they might agree in the expediency and in the necessity of -an expurgation of the statutes, he thorght such expurgation,-which must precede the consolidation of the statutes-and the consoldation of the law itself should be placed in the samc hands. The two things were parts of one great and entire work, and the sooner it was achieved the better. If the present machinery was inadequate for the purpose, let other machinery be devised; but ho thought it quite cleai- that the expurgation of the statutes and their consolidation should be placed under the superintendence of the same persons. He thought, therofore, the hen, member for East Surrey would see that the means by which he proposed to accomplish this important object were not adequate for its attainment. He did not wish to disparage in the slightest deree the labours and exertions of that hon, gentleman with reference to the consolidation of the statutes and the improvement of the Law; but when the hon. gentleman complained that his proposition did not receive the concurrence of tho Government, hut on some occasions met with their opposition, he should remember that lie did not always brmg forward those propositions in such a form that the Government could assent to them, In this ease, certainly, the hon. gentleman must feel that it would be useless for that House to adopt a resolution, calling upon an officer of the House of Lords, without the consent of that House, to parform certain duties for the House of Commons. Sir F. KELLY conceived that all who desired the consolidation of the statutes must be anxious to ascertain what statates were repealed and what statutes were partially repealed, and to sw eep such laws from the statute book; but his ob5ection to the motion was=, that the two objects which it prepcosed were impracticable. In the first place, it provided that thle Clerk of the Parliaments should ascertain what statutes or parts of stiatutes had expired or were repealed, and, next, that a revised edition of the statuteswith the rpealed enactments struck out-should be publisbed for the use of that House. Now, the Clerk of the Parliaments, independently of his not being an officer of that House, was no more qualified for this task, and had no greater means at his dis"osal for its accomplishment, than any individual who mught by chance have been named. Then, with regard to the publication of a revived edition of the statutes, the motion referred only to statutes and parts [ of statutes which had expired or had been expressly repealed; but there were many statutes which had become I obsolete and nugatory and, some montha after the publica- tion of the edition of the statutes contemplated by the TesoI lution, it might be found that a new and revised edition was required, omitting the obsolete statates. He was surprised to hear his hon. friend refer to what had been done an the State of New York, as if it bore any Isimilarity to what was called for in this country. In N'ew IYork they had to deal only with the general public acts that |related to their own State; hut here we liad to deal with all th &cPublic acts relating not only to England but te Ireland, |Scotland, the East Indies, and the colonies, besides the innumerable local acts and the financial and revenue measures thatfrom time totime hadbeenpassed by Parliament. To undertake the consolidation of our statutes would therefore baa work of much greater magniitude in this country than in New York (Hear, hear.) In the minds of some gentlemen codiicationr- and consolidation appeared to be regarded as much the same thing, but no impression could be more mistaken. The truth was that codification would be found utterly impracticable till it was based on the foundation of a good and effective consolidation of our statute law. (Hear, hear.) He beEieved that if the hon. gentleman an hisfriends would only act with forbeance towards thie commission which had been apointed to consider this subject, and leave them to do their be$twithout fettering them with unnecessary instructions, they -would be able, before any great length of time elapsed, to achieve more for the consolidation of the statue law than had been accomplished'since the days of Lord Bacon. (Hear, heat.) it'-' M1r. S. WORTLEY hoped it would not be inderstood that thosewho opposed thue present motionwere adverse to a' reform of the law or: a consolidation of the statutes. He did not think-the motion ofthe-hon. gentleman-would take thoem one step forward in' the way of the reform of the statuto law. (Hear.) There clearly existed a great confusion of ideas as to the sub ect of consolidation and codification; and he nst say he had never heard a sound practica suggestio'n throw out as to how thework of e-i cation was to be carried.outin this coutry.

SILISTEDRS' MQ=ZE URELKD.) Mr. FAGAN' rose to more, that this House wil mm ately resolve itself into a committee to consider the act the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 11, with the vilw amending the same, so far as respects the tax there enacted to be levied in eight corporate towns in land, lien and substitution of " Mtinisters' Monevr" in order tl the said tax may be wholly abolished. le had so oft brought the subject under the attention of the ouse Itb he would not then occupy m3uch of its time, but it would only right upon his part to state clearly in- what position question had een pLaced by the act of Sir J. Young in 1854. That act was not, as had been alleged, a corn mise between the Government and that party with w he had the honour of acting upon this question, nor did believe that it was a compromise between members of th Government who differed in opinion npon the subject, the effect of it had been to considerab y aggravate the t main grievances of which he had alvays complained. grevances were, that the tax was one which aly. look-ed upon as marking the ascendancy of the Protests on the one side and the consequent inferiority of the Ro Cathoics on the other; and, again, that it was paltry amount, but from its partiality it was a most iritati impost. The tax was levied in eight tos whr the majority of the inhabitants were Roman Catholics, anc that grievance was increased by Sir J. Youngms Act; which provided that it should be collected by the tovwn coun. cillors. He had not brought the subject before the House during the last session, because, if he had done so, he knew that it would have been immediately objected to him that the act of Sir J. Young had not come into operation; but that objection could not rowhold, for the act was in full operation, and the result. df it was that the town coumnils had, vith one accord, determined upon not collecting the tax. The tax had been collected in Dublin, but there the duty of collection was not imposed upon the corporation, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin, himself of Conservative tendencies, had urged upon the Secretary for Ireland the expediency of getting rid of an impost so objectionable. On former occasions he hacl been told that the tax had been 20D years in cxistence, and that it would be a violation of the rights of prop iG abolish it; but Sir J.Young's Act demolished that objection, for it provided that houses under IO a-year should be ex-. empt from the tax, and in that case the incumbents paid from the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commission, tbats, if thae principle were extended, ojecti his proposal could not be grounded upon section that it would injure the incumben maintined that uder the Church Temveralites was not inconsistent for thatHoseito ask the Eec Commissioners, if thcy had the funds, to pay tEs eats in these eight towns in Ireland, and so vRoman Catholic inhabitants fromettheopaymen At the present moment tbe income of the Commlssioneen amouted t o y neay 100, _ and it was constantly increasing. ]tb _sn b sithiuthe last two years the expendcturehad aLsoin hut, notwvithstanding this, there was a surplus last'PlZ,0so0L;.and if to this w ere added a sum of SOaO,00L th3 value of the Property now lying dormant wshich might be made available by the sale of purpetuitieS, heo thought it; woufld he seen that this fund would, if wvell administrd, be suficient to effect the object he had in viewi. Laoding to' the manner in which members of the present Administration had on previous occasions supported his motion, and to the fact that the large majority of Irish members {whose views on apurely Irish subject ought surely to go for something} would vote in its favour, he could not believe that ther was any intention on the part of the Government to tE permnision to introduce this bill. lIn DUh1LOP seconded the motion.-_ 'Ur. HOMS3AN bore testimony to the fart that 1b gentleman had always been an honest and straightfor agitator of this question, and that he had shown his con. tency in having been nopartyto the so-called comprm effected by Sir John Young's Act, which the hon. membe-. now wished to amend. He would not follow the hon. mem her into aU the qnestions he had submitted to the House, o2 into the remedy he hadreposed. He agreed with the hon. member in thinking that the operation of the existing was not satisfactory, and that in some respects it re amendment. He would not statein-what respect he tho the law required amendment. He understoodhishon. to propose that the tax should be no longer levied houses, but out of the funds of the Ecclesiastical Co sion. That discussion would come on most properly the second reading, if the House chose to alow the I go toasecond reading. Agreeing, therefore,tothepro his hon. friend to introduce a measure to amend the reserved any objections he might have to the billwh question of the nature of the remedy could be free satisfactorily discussed. Mr. NiAPIER must declare that the conduct and of the right hon. gentleman had taken him entirely 1 prise. Be had understood from his answer to a qu put to him the other day, that the Goveinment wo permit any change to be made in the act. Mr. HORSIAN.-I never said so. I never gave such answer. lMr. NAPIER had inferred this from an answer the hon. gentleman had given. Hehad been a;kedwheth Government had any act on the subject in contemp and his answer was, that they had none.

Yet the noble lord now allowed a be brought in by a private member which nnsett whole affair.

Lord N AS was astonished at the oursetaken Government, since they sanctioned the introduction bill that settled this important questioutwo years a SecretaryforIrelandhadsaid that the p resent ac J.

(" Hear, hearn, a laughL) Then the right hon. and learned genemai say, " Oh, you ought to have refused permison to bring in the bill on the simple ground that this nestiOm ought to be settled onice for all" This is not the timnewe have heard lange of that kind. I am ola noughto remember many occasions upon which this House as been urgedfor smiar reasons to refuse to permit the! utroduction of measures for' the relief of the - Romant otholics. But does the right hon. and learned gentleman e that it matters much upon which stage of a measure hHousearrives at &decisionwith regard toC it? 'Do he ~imagine that there is any particalarvirtue in a refusal to pc : b to be brought in, which 'does not sttach tO-b to llow it ob bread a second time? The right hon. ~.nd learned gentlemen will have just the sme means of enforcing .ls opinions by argument upon the second reading as upon tho introduction of tho bilL Wo think-it more respectful to. those whose feelings are in. tereted in this question to allow the mcasure to be brought in, than to re!ect it at once; but we reserve to ournelves full and entire liberty. to take upon the second reading whatever coo we think it best and most expedient to adopt. t Captain JONES thought that if he penritted this resolu- sion to puss without a division, ho should be bound, as ani tion man, to vote or the bill to be founded unon it. He had not been able to gather whether teh Setretary for Irgladexpressed the opinion that the ta.x ought to be Lord J. RwUSSELL-I think, writh regard to the form of this motion, that it isgenerally inconvenient to pass resolutions from which it may3appear that the House has made uip- its mind as to the questions to which ther relate. In dealing with certain questions, we are forced to take that course in order to introduce a bill, but in this case no neces. ityof thekindexists, and such a course would naturally giverise to msapprehension ard induce many persons out ef doors h hink that the House hnd come to a resolution to abolish this tax. I would therefore suggest to the hon. genUeman (3Mr. Fagan), without at all disapproving the view taken by the Government, that lcave ought to be given to bring ina bill with regard to Ministers' Money inLvland, that it would bo more convenient for him simply to move ror leave to bring in a bill in order to abolish that tax. No doubt, upon the second rending we shall' hear from tho Secretary for Ireland what his views are with respect to the shutance of the question. I had hoped that the measure propared by SirJ. Yloung would have been satisfactory, but rans . sory to hear both from the hon. gentleman who brought forward the motion, and from the right hon. gentleman below me (Mr. Horsman), that it has not. If that bo the case, it would then be the duty of Government to propose some bill to amend the d4ects in the present law. Up,,a the sec.nd reading we shall no dotubt heari;heir views or the subject, but I hope the hon. gentleman -(Mr. Fagan) w;il now adopt the course I have suggested. Mr. M&GUIRE said, Sir J. Young's bill, so far from being satisfactory, was p rotested apinst by every corporation in Ireland affeted by it. humerouspetitionsweore presented against it, and he and his friends remained in the lousa. night after night for the purpose of defeating it. Sir J. Younm, in proposing it, was actuated by the mischievous spint of wishing to carry ont his own proposals ini spite of every reumonstrance. He (Mr. Maguire) wished to express his extreme dissatisfaction at the statement of the Secretary for Ireland. The Government wero expected fotake some d.cisive step, and it was not manly or straightforward on their part to refuse to deal with the question, and to leave it in the hands of a private member. If the right hon. gentleman attempted to cobble up the miserable abortion of Sir J. Young, he would signally fail, for tho people of Ireland would spurn and-resist it. They would not be satisfied with the amendnent of the present law, they desired its total abolition. lfr. SULLIVAN confessed that the statement made by the Secrctary for Ireland had disappointed him for he had not expected that the right hon. gentleman w ouid have been insenstble to the deep feeling which this tax had produced, not only in the particular towns where it was imposed, but goneully throughout Ireland. (oear.) On the day when the deputation waited on the right lioii. gentleman, several Lon. members of that House, unconnected with corporate towns in Ireland, voluntarily attended, in order to imoress on the mind of the right hon. gentlemanthe necessity of settEngthis question. He had heard with deep" pain tho ,ehmadebythe right hon. member for Dublin-tniversity that evening, aludhew as surethat,ifthatrighlthon.gentlenian were aqutainted with the oppression which this tax caused in the citV he (Wr. Sullivan) had the honour to represent, the right hen. gentleman would be the last to advocato it. In the-last valuation, the clergyman in one of the parishes of that city, anticipating what might occur by reason of the passing of a bill on this subject, took care to value propertyfwhich had neverbeforo been brought under the imposition of the tax, and raised his income 40 or 50 per cent. Was that the speCes of justice wVhich thee right hon. gentleman advocated, and was that the sort of tax which ho claimed as property for the established church7? He would tell the Governmcnt that the Catholic population of the taxed cities were determined by every legal and constitutional means to resist the imposition. He characterized the ,bil introduced by Sir J. Young on this subject last session as abominable. and declared that it produced universal disiatisfacdion. The people of Ireland, particularly the Catholic ortion, expected that the noble lord at the hcad of the Goverrmnent, wvho owed his position in that house to no scarticuLtr pzrty, but to the universal assent of the people of cland, wvould have on this occasion sown some smpty with die people oppred by tis tax, and would ave, to a certain degree, made his Government znemorabl by announcing in an honest and manly wy the totalreeal of theabominableimposition. Mfr. FAG i? hero intimated that, in consequence of what lie had heard in the course of the debate, he should witharaw his niotion for a committee, and nmove at onc for leave to brng in a bil! for the total abolition of Ministers' Money in Ireland. Mr. BLACK wished to observe, when lie heard hon. members denouncing this odious tax, which vwas imposed ,on eight cities in Irelaznd, that a similar odious ta-x wv imposed on t-o cities in Scotland, one of which 7h represented, and it was calld the Annuity Tax,. Ife trusted, therefore, that if the Ministers' Monr-y were repea.ld in Ireland, there wvould also be a repead of the annuity tax in Scotland, for what was good for one country would be good for the other. (Hear, hear.) The motion for a committee was then withdraw-.. and leave was given to bring in a bill to abolish Ministers' Money in Ireland. The biU was subsequently introduced, and read a first time. TENANTS' COMPENSATION- (ITIELAND). Mr. G. Moor.E *nd other Hon. Members presented several petitions for compensation to tenants for improvement of lands im Ireland. Mr. G. MOORIE then said, he was given to understand that'neither of the two great parties in the house intended to oppose the present nmotion; hut, instead of expressing his satisfaction at there being no opposition to the introduction of this bill, he ought rather to express Iiis surprise that they should leave to a member sitting below the gani-ay the Jionour of introducinga measure with regard to the necessity of which both parties were agreed. Two bills on tenant right were introduced in the sessions of 1852 and 1853, by two sRcCessive Ministers; the one under the auspices of the Government of Lord Derby, and endorsed with the responsible namues of the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-GeneraL and the Secretary for Ireland; the other, under the sanction of the Government of which the present IPremier was a distinm_ished member, and the care of which was confided to the irish Secretary. Tiie preambles of the -bo bills concurred in reciting that it would tend to the improvement and better cultivation of land if provision were made by lat for securing to tenants in Ireland compensation for improvements made in land in their lawful veesession, and likewciseweuld be expedient to provide cornpensation for improvementss made by outgoing tenants. It -followred, or ought to followv, that both parties wsere of <opinion compensation should be made for improvements to rish tenants. ow ws it that no such bill had been int duced by theGovernment? The noblelord said he had re ceived no encouragement to do so. He admitted the truth of the reply. The noble lord had received no encouragement to protect the rights of the tenantry of Ireland, just as the noble lord the member for the city Nof Ilondon received no encouragement in 1847 to protect *their lives. The noble lord had not received that wholesome encouragement which alone induced Ministers to move -that encouragement which, subsequently to 1847, was ex-tended to the noble lord the member for London at the time -oE the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and was so exceedingly efficacious, pour encouraeer les taures. In many successive Seons r. S. Crawford endeavoured in vain to induce Parliament to consider this question. At the general dection in 185l_ however, the Irish peoplc, admonishled by previous errors, sent to those benches, not the scanty remnant which lingered there, but half a hundred reprenetatives pledged to carry a measure for securing Irish tenant right. Yielding to that most formidable encouragement, the Attorney-'eneral, underLord Derbys -Govermnent, discovered that his whole life had been passed in the elunidation of this question, and -tha he hadjust succeeded in arriving at its solution-that Mr. S. Crawford was onlyayoung beginner,andthathe was the real Simon Pure. He would do the right hon. gentleman the justice to say he did introducea measure which underproper encouragement might have been ultinately moulded into a great boon for the tenant farmers of Ireland. Unfortunately that result was prevented, and the =neasure and the Government perished together. On the -acesion of the next Mlinistry the motive power, encouragemrent, ws divided nearlyha2£ and, half, and the conseonences -wre hf an half measurea on the part of the Goveimnent -and the Opposition. Both bills were sent to a comanittee, and the committee reported to the House. Me hesitated to purme t'he quetion further because Le heedtated to speak with disrespect of either side of the House of Commons, but he thought no hon, member would venture to aRert that the proceedings which ensued siere creditable to eithr party.

I The quotation of gold at Paris in about 5per inille premium (according to the last tariff), which, 4t the English Mint price of 31.17s. 10sd. ncr oz. for tandard gold, gives aan exchange of 2..29j; and, the ;exchange at Paris on London at short being 25.35, it follows that gold is about 0.22 per cent. de3acer in London than in Pans. By advices from Hlamburg tho price of gold is 426T per 'mark, which, at the English Mint price of 31. i7s. t0dd. peroz. for dard gold, gives an cxchange of 13.52; and, the exchange at Hamburg on London at short being 13.6, it followwsthat gold is 0.53 per cent. dearer in tLondon than ia lTn cburt, of exchange at New York on London for bills at 64 days' sight is 108n per cent., and, the p,ar of exchange'between England and Acerica b,eing 109 23-40 per cent., it foLlow that the exchange is nominally 0.83.-per cent, against England; but, after making aIllowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transnission of gold eitherway between the two countries. The tone of the English fuids has been quiet today, and they have shovwn as much steadiness as could have been anticipated in the face of the comingloan.

The suspension has been announced to-day of MIessrs. Cambouroglou Lcno and Co., one of the Greck houses engaged in the Danube corn trade. Their difficulties are attributed to the circumstance of many of their cargoes being detained in the Danube, and their friends express confident anticipations that the assets of the firm will be sufticient ultimately to meet all claims in fulL Their uncovered liabilitics are only about 20,0001. Draughts of considerable amount of the Tipperary Joint-stock Bank continue to be returned by their London agents, notwithstanding the recent intimation that the business of the establishment would go on witlhoult interription. The commercial advices from New York to-day are favourable, since, while the present packet has brought specie to the amount of 60,0001., they lead to the expectation of a larger total by the next. The recent improvement in the stock-market, consequent uponthe arrival of the peace news, had been well supported. E3rie Railway stood at 54; Reading, 87; Panama, 10O(}; and Illinois Central Bonds, 83i. The winter was still severe, and the interruplion thus caused to internal comumunication interfered with the preparations for the spring trade. The bank statements for the past week had been satisfactory, and money on the best paper was obtainable with ease at 8 to 9 per cent. From Mexico the dates are to the 19th of January, and furnish eveiy indication of a rapid return to anarchy. Haro y Tamariz, who was sentenced to banishment, had escaped, and a variety of other chiefs were acting in open hostility to the Government. The President had called upon the National Guard to unite in sup- port of order, and had warned the people that if the ! reactionists slhould again succeed aJl hope of the country preserving its independence mast be aban. doned. The shipments of specie by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Alma amount to 487,0831., of which 8,4701. is gold for Alexandria, Ceylon, Bombay, and MIadras, and 478,6131. for Bombay and Calcutta.

The poltical oto-of t nntsr woatinneA nr. nasettled he President bad issued a decree, dated the Ist, and published on the 17th uIt., abolishing the old I Junta de Credito Publico,' and establishing a new financial board of seven members, four of whom, including the chairman, were to be nominated bythe Government, the fifth by the national creditors, the sixth by the manufacturers, and the seventh by the agriculturists. This board was in future to have the entire managnement of everything relating to the collection as well as to the accounts of the Cnstoms revenue, and of the assignments made on it in favour of foreign and domestic bondholders and diplomatic convention creditors. The 11th paragraph of the Lst article of this decree enumerates among the functions of the board that of ' collecting the portion of the duties assigned to the foreign debt an l of remitting it to London to such mercantile house as the board may appoint.' It is to be hoped that General Comonfort's Government. may last long enough to carry out this plan. The members of the board had not been appointed at the date of MIr.

A meeting of the Australasian Pacific Mafil Stean4 Company took place this afternoon? Mr. G. Hlib-. bert in the chair, when the followmng report was adopted:- "The directors havo assembled the proprietors at the fourth annual general meeting in accordance with the xrovisions of the company's deed of settlement. The directors regret exceedingly that tho hopes hold out in the report presented to the meeting of proprietors in August last; of closing the concerns of the company and of making a final retum, have not yet been realizedL This delay has principally arisen from the unsettled accounts with tho Ad. ty, the great difficulty of disposing of tho remaining stock of coals at Wellington, and a settlement with tle Commissioners of the Income-tax, which Lst claim, howvord has been paid during the past week. The coals at AuJeland havo been sold and paid for, but the premiises in 3loorgate-street have not been'dispeead of, notwithstauding the exertions of tho directors. he proprictors ,soWever, niay rest assured that sthol anxiety of tho directors to bring the aflairs of the company to a final settlement is equal to their own." At a meeting of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, held to-day, Mr. Hope presiding, the report 'and accounts were unanimously adopted. The prinoipal topic brought under discussion was the failure of Mr. Scott Russell and the position in which ho stood with regard to the directors. It was stated that tho company possess three contacts or agreements with him-one for buildinv the hull of the leviathan steamer, a second for the construction of engines, and a third for paddlewheels and the screw. No question, it is alleged, can arise witlh respect to the property,- &c., comprised in the vessel as it stands, the directors having taken the precaution to secure in their own right. the ground on which tho works have been conducted. The other contracts, it is also believed, are in a position to insure the interests of the company, even should Mr. Russells affairs eventually pass into baniruptcy. Tho total amount of these engagements were put down at 332,2501., of wlhich the company have advanced 292,2951., leaving aboout 40,0001. to be paid on the completion of The contracts. The security possessed for their performance is 2,000 Eastern Steam Navigation shares, on which 101. per share has been paid, making an aggregate of 20,0001. Neither the directors nor-Mr. Brunel, the engineer, are able to state what loss is likely to accrtue from the suspension of Mr. Russell, since, in addition to the delay, there wiUl be the extra cost of completing the vessel under other arrangements than those originally contemplated. Although the month of August has been named as the period when it may be finished, much will depend upon the facility of reawning operations and providing the necessary capital. Great complaints are made of the pressure of calls and the large amount (149 3001.) of arrears due. The directors urge that theyhave adopted the proper measureS for enforcin,g payment m cases where parties are solvent, and, notwithlstanding the difficulties encountered, they are gradulally recovering the money. As the larger ,proportion of the shlareholders a3re in a condition to discharc'e these liabilities, it is presumed to be unwise to proceed to a general forfeiture of shares, especially at such a critical moment. The board have, however, received authority from the meeting to tke steps for accepting a forfeiture or surrender of shares in cases where it can be accomplished with advantage to the company. Approval was expressed of the judgment exercised by the directors in keeping the property intact and within their own controi, and they continsietogive their services gratuitously. The annexed extract from the report relates to the connexion of Air. Russell with the company:- It will, no doubt, be in the recollection of the shareholders that at the fourth annual general meeting, and subsequently at the half-yearly meeting held in ;September last, the directors reported - that the vesscl vas in rapid course of construction, and that every effort was making-to conmplete the works at the earliest period possible. Shortly after the meeting in September it becamo apparent that the works wvere not progressing at tho rate whicll theybiad been led to expect, and, on remonstrating with Mr. Russell, it appeared that his vievws as to the payments to which he wvas or would from time to time bo entitled were not consistent with tlo interests and rights of tho company. Under tha advico of Mr. Brunel a modification was proposed in the terns of the contract, based on the princinle of a strict inspection of the vork performcd and of paymcnts to ba niade accordingly. It may here be observed that the coIIIrany hold in trust 2,000 shares, which originally belonged to Mr. Russell, and wvere deposited by hrim as security for the duo perfonniince of his contract. Tho works proceeded under this arrangement for some time, but eventuaUy it became agi,arent that Mr. R lussell was not in a Position to -<^r uerft out satlsractorlly, -nl vIy i - o present month, .as the proprietary are aware, ho stopped payment. In .nticipation of his stoppage, and in order to avert the inj.unous consequences of this state of things, the directors made payments to Mr. Russell on account of wages, and endeavoured in everymiuanner compatible ivith the interests of the company to avoid the necessity of taking the work out of his hands (a course vhich could not but be attended with deLay and loss); but at length, acting under the advice of Mr. Brunel, the directors, on the 5th day of February inst., gave notice to Mr. RusseU that they should proceed to complete the shlip unider the provisions contained in the coatract enabling them to do so, in case of failure by the contractor to comply nith the terms of his contract. Subsequently to that period, and on the 12th of February inst., a mecting of Mr. Russel's creditors took place, and the directors are nowv awaitinw the result of arrangements at present under discussion to decide on the best course to be adopted for the completion of the ship. In the meantime the directors, acting under legal advice, have t.aken thc requisite measures for securing the property of the company and maintaining their rights under the terms of their contracts, so as to be prepared to act in the interests of the company, wlhatever may be the course adopted in regard to Mr. Russell's affairs. There is no doubt that the eventwhich has happened will bh attended with some delay and some increased cost, but beyond this the directors see no reason to npprehend any serious injury to the undertaking. It will be obvious that inder present circumstances it IS not yet possible to lay down a definite arrangement for completing the vessel, hut the proprietary may rely upon the director-s' exertions in organzin- arran"emeats for completing and launching the vessel with as ittle delay as possible, probably in the course of August

Daniel in tl.e ciair. lehereport, an abstract of which has appeared in TAc Thincs,T,as taken as'read. The CQRA-;UtAN, int moving the adoption of the report, a4-crted'to the statements therein, and remarked that there had been a falling6off in the traffic of every station on their ine duringtlel p.ast year, which was the main cause of the decrease in their dividend. It was, however, a curious fact that the traffic on the linle from the :30th of December last up tothe p resent time had increased far beyond that of the corresponding period of last year or that of tho year 1Cfore. Ife had an idea that the falling off in the traffa on the line had arisen from the depression oE trade, but -was "lad it had not arisen from that cause. The general rorking of the traffic had been most excellent. Everything had been conducted with the utmost regularity. the (nmgnes and carriages were in good order, the accounts of the stores had all been carefuly gone over, and he ca,Id assure them that everytling was quite satisfactory. They on4- required fine weather to encourage their pleasure traffic to Gravesend and Soithend. They would find that their working expenses wvere ratler decreased than othenrise, ancl he hoped they wvouid go on as far as their actual requirements were concerned still more favourably. They had now received above 1,0001. niore from pacsengers since the 1st of January than they had either at the corresponling period of last year or the year before, and every other part of the traffic was improving. M1r. G. SaivIc wished to knoow the object of the bMil now in Parliament for the branch line to Barking. The CaesUxUsr said it would enable the Tilbury Company to compete moro effectually for the Gravesend trafficF and to inerease the speed of the trains. It would a's3 accommo(late the population of theBow and Barliag district, where there was a vast amount of city-going traffic. The Eastern Counties line to Woodford would som be opened for traffic, and they had reason to suppose that a portion of it would come to Fenchurch-strect station. In reply to questions it was stated that the receipt; from the Tilbury passengers over the line averaged rather mire than 2jd. each, and paid very well, as they wera at no expense in conveying them. The directors would b: happDy to receive anygsuggestious by adopting which the; wead hoo enabled to imp?rove the trafflc. The report was then adopted, and a dividend of 3s. 6d. per share was declared, payable on the 20th inst. Mr. Bishop and Mr. Lee, the retiring directors, were re. elected. Mr. G. S=T proposed that the qualification of a director of the company shound be 103 shares in fa'iuro, instead of 40 shares as at present. On taidng the opini >n of the meeting on the proposition by a show of handX it was negatived by 43 against 39. On the motion for the election of an auditor t'ser3 appeared fourcandidates-namely, SIr.

ZOYDOZ, WEDNESDAY, FEBUABY 20, 18. The House of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock. Earl GnEY gave notice that on Friday he should anove an ani6niacnt to -Lord LYmDntrsT's resolu*tiow- on the Wensleydale peerage case; and that, *up>oting the amendment to be carried, he should follow it upby a series of resolutions on the same Auestion. lThe a.mendmcnt and resolutions are -iven in our repovt. = . I;rd GL.:EL alIso- gave notice that he -should move to ask the opinion of the Judges on the same subject. The Earlof DBRBY gave notice that on Thursday he should, put a question to Lord PANrvUP as to the resplective duties and, responsibilities of the Secretary of State for the War Department and the Commander-in-Chief of Hun M.rmIA3s Forces- I and that he should ask for the production of any doc uments limiting or defining those duties. Mir. W. S5m= appeared at the bar, and put in certain journals of the House as evidence, in accordance with the order of the Committee of Privileges on Mlonday last. TheVice-President of theCommittee of Council of Education Bill, the House of Commons Offices Bill and the Metropolitan Police Bill were read a thir time. The Earl of HEAnDwrCE aslked Lord PAssNrN what were the intentions of Her MIajesty's Government 4ith regard to the Russian ships of war sumk in the harbour of SebastoDol. Lord PAN3Rne said nothing that gallantry and science could effect would be left undone to msure the destruction of what was above the water in Sebastopol or beneath it. The House then adjourned. It the House of Commons, in reply to an inquiry by Mtr. H. BAMJE The CHACELLOR of the EXCHEQUER stated that, in the event of there being no objection on the part of the Bank of England, he should be prepared to bring in a bill for continuing the arrangement (which would expire this year unless renewed). by which the Bank agreed to pay to those private banks which consented to withdraw their paper circulation 1 per cent. per annum upon the average issue of those banks in the three previous years, and to continue the same on the existin' conditions. M1r. MAcxINoNt moved for a Select Committee to consider the inconvenience felt from the want of equitable tribunals whereby differencesbetween masters and operatives might be amicably adjusted. Some amendnient of the law on this subject he assumed to be called for, and what he wanted, he said, was a committee, composed of master manufacturers and gentlemen who had turned their attention to the subject, to consider and decide upon the expediency of the tribunals he suggested, which mnight conciliateworkmen with masters. The inquiry, at all events, could do no harm. Sir G. Gnxv said he had no objection to such an inquiry, provided it was undertaken with a full knowledge of what the foreign Conseils des Prad'hommnes were, their functions being administrative and judicial, extending to questions of contract. He thought it desirable that tribunals of the kind suggested by Mr. MI.Acairs02o- should be established; but he hoped the House would not be led into the error of supposing that such tribunals should regulate wages. The motion was agreed to. Mr. L. K-NQ moved a resolution, that there be prepared, under the direction of the Clerk of the Parliaments, an edition of the statutes at large for the use of the House, omitting all such statutes and parts of statutes as are expired or have been expressly repealed ; and that, in the place of the statutes or parts of statutes repealed, there be inserted the titles of the statutes repealed, the numbers and abstracts of the clauses repealed, with a reference to the statutes by which they are repealed. He cited various authorities in support of the object of his motion, appealing to the example of the State of :N'ew York, which had consolidated its statute Law; and he argued that the work proposed was not one of great difficulty, while nothing would tend more to illustrate Han Ma.ivs'rv's reign. The motion was seconded by Mr. W. EwArT, who, however, wished that the edition should not be confmed to the use of the House, but be adapted for public use. He despaired, however, of anything in this direction iuntil we had the indispensable motive power, in a Minister of Justice. The Avroismy-GE-ERuL hoped Ir. Kn-G would not press his resolution. The important work he proposed was, the ArroRNry-GE-ERAL observed, one of gigantic character, which could not be done mechanically, but must be accomplished, at the expense of much labour and time, by one who brought to the undertaking great legal knowledge. Another objection was this:-the House was called upon to resolve tha't th4 worl- llod-lbe-die-bytEL C1or3of the Parliaments for the use of that House,the Clerk of the Parliaments being an officer of the House of Lords. However they might agree as to the necessity of expurgating the statute-book, the work should form a part of one great whole-the consolidation of the statute law. Sir F. KELLY agreed with Mr. Xrr-o that the ascertaining what statutes were actually in force was an object worthy of attainment; but his objections were, first, that the Clerk of the Parliaments, besides being an officer of the House of Lords, wras no more qualified for the task than any other individual that might be named; second, that by the time the new edition of the statutes was published other acts would have expired or become obsolete, and a further edition would be requisite; and, lastly, if the object be practicable, it was unnecessary, since the plan he hadproposed for the consolidation of the statute law would more effectually answer the end in view. Mr. S. WoaTyma observed that Mr. 1s-oG'S proposition was neither more nor less than to publish a convenient pocket edition of the statutes, which would be of no more authority than any other edition. It was a most difficult question to determine what statutes were repealed. MIr. WATsox said the first thing to be done towards the consolidation of the statates was to get rid of the repealed statutes; and if the resolution did not propose that the work should be done by the Clerk of the Parliaments he should concur in the motion. After some remarks by Mr. G. BuTr, Mr. R. Prsairon moved, by way of amendment, the omission of the words " under the direction of the Clerk of the Parliaments," and " for the use of this House." This amendment was negatived, and upon a division the main question was negatived by 164 to 63. Mr. FAGAN moved a resolution, that the House immediately resolve into a committee, to consider the act 1r and 18 VIcroRm, c. U, with the view of amending the same, so far as respects the tax thereby enacted to be levied, in lieu of " Ministers' Money," in order that the tax may be wholly abolished. He adverted to the different position in which this oftagitated question was placed in consequence of the passing of Sir Jonw YoUNG's Act, in 1854, which, it was said, he observed, was a compromise, but he denied that it was so; on the contrary, he contended that it was an aggravation of the grievances suffered by the eight towns of Ireland upon which the tax was levied. He insisted that the revenues of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were amply sufficient to meet the demands of this tax, and that the payment of the incumbents of the eight towns out of that fund was not inconsistent ;with its objects andl purposes. I Mr. Housar.fx admitted that, as regarded the operation of the exting act, it was not satiafactory, and that, in some respects, the act required amendment. Agreeing, therefore, in Mr. PAGAN's proposition to introduce a measure to amend the act, he should reserve any observations on the part of the Government until the second reading of the bill. -3r. NAI'r was surprised at the course taken by the Government, which, he said, was neither creditable nor manly. There might be inconveniences under the existing act, but the Government should take upon itself to amend it, and not alloow a private member to unsettle the whole affair. Mr. MnBoGnsa. made a few remarks, and Lord NAus, referring to the conclun words of the resolution, "in order that the tax may be wholly abolished," inquired whether it was the intention of the Government to support the entire repeal of the iexistinc act. I Lord PAi3IEXSTON vindicated the conduct of the Government in assenting to the introduction of a MilU, reserving to themaselves full li'oerty to state the course they might thinkl it expedient toadopt on the second reading. Admiral JoNE,s condemned this course. L lord 3. Rusrssr observed that there was no necessity for the House to come to a resolution upon the subject, and suggested to Mir. FAoAx that the most proper course was for him to move for leave to. bring in a billlto repeal the tax. After some observations from, Mr. MAGunE, Mr. SuLLrvA&, and MIr. BAcs., who expressed a hope that if the miters' moneygin Ireland were repealed the annuity tar in Edinburgh would share the same fate, the motion was withdrawn and leave was given to Mr. FAGAN to bring in a bill to repeal the tax.-- Mr. MoonE prefaced a motion for leave to bring in a bill to provide for compensation to tenants for the improvement of lands in Ireland with a sketch of the manner in which the subject of tenants' compensation had been dealt,with by successive Administrations. Leave was given to bring in the bill. Mr. DuTNor obtained leave to introduce a bill to make further provision for rendering reformatory and industrial schools in Scotland more available for the benefit of vagrant children, and a bill to constitute all legally qualified persons in Scotland Conmmissioners of Supply, without being named in an Act of Supply. The Select Committees on Adulterations of Food, Are., on Civil Service Superannuation, on Silver and Gold Wares, and on Ecclesiastical Comnission, &c., were nominated. The CivilService Sunerannuation Bill was read a second time, and referred to the Select Committee appointed to consider the whole subject of superannuation allowances. The House adjourned at a quarter to 9 o'clock.
We dare say that our impression of the proceedlings in the House of Lords on the subject of the Wensleydale Peerage is very different from that of the principal actors in this quasi-medieval drama, but we confess that they appear to us to be engaged in something very like solemn and laborious trifling. A majority of the Peers beEeve, as we think most erroneously, that their dignity and the dignity of their Order are concerned in preventing the establishment of a peerage for life; 'and so the highest court of justice sets the example to all the inferior tribunals of the country of constituting itself tho judge in what it believes to be its own cause. Animated by pride, by jealousy, by aU the narrow feelings which actuate men who have got a monopoly which they mean to keep, the. House of Lords, after the show of a debate on legal grounds, refers to itself, under another name, the decision of a question, with all proper judicial impartiality, upon which it believes that all that it holds dear reposes. Such a spectacle is neither edifying nor reassuring, and has little tendency to increase the reputation of the priests of this our highest temple of justice. GuidedX by men every one of whom is the first of his family wlho has borne the honours of the peerage, and who therefore unite in no small degree the dexterity of practised advocates with the more than aristocratic tendencies of aspiring parvenus, the House of Lords sits down to go through the farce of investigating whether that which it has determined beforehand shall not be law be law or no. It seems very likely that, so far as a life peerage is concerned, the House of Lords may for the moment carry their point; for strong indeed must be the love of titles and dignities which can induce any second person to brave the obloquy and clamour which the distinguislhed lawyer on whori the QuEEN has exercised an undoubted prerogative has to encounter. Little right as the House of Lords may intrinsically have to erect itself into a court for trying and limiting the prerogative of the SovEnEiGcc, their powers of obstruction and annoyance are so great that we do not doubt they may virtually usurp a right which they cannot be shown legally to possess. They may succeed in their present struggle, and wrest one power more from that Royal prerogative by virtue of which alone they exist, and by the exercise of which alone can their Order be recruited and maintained. Let us suppose themT to have conquered, and then ask. thos whose pcaions will permit them to reason what w,i be the value of their victory. They will have struck a blow at the power of the Ctowi most sure to recoil on themselves, and strained the doctrine of desuetude to an extent which materially weaklens that very principle of authority and respect for tradition upon which an hereditary aristocracy must mainly rely. They loosen the keystone of the arch, and fondly delade therMelves with the idea that - the rest of the fabric can remain unmoved. They avowedly exclude from their Order personal merit, however great, unless attended either with wealth sufficient to support an hereditary dignity or with| the meanness that can found a pauper peerage. Let the Peers consider for a moment why the question of peerages for life was raised, and whether, if they can succeed in putting down peerages for life, they will have succeeded in, destroying the causes and convictions out of which the creation of Lord Wxxsy.xDvATx arose. The House of Peers enjoys-some say has usurped-the duties of the highest appellate court in this country. That jurisdiction has ever been a scandal to the administration of justice, from the times when Lord HARD-usiOE and Lord ELDON affirmed their own judgments and would admit no legal peer to share the duty with themi, to these modern days, when we have seen three Whig Lords overrule the judgment of two Tory Lords and the majority of the Judges, as in O'Coi,-N.'s case, or now, when the highest Court usually consists of one common law and one equity lawyer, who regard matters from different sides and come to exactly opposite conclusions, 1 so that no judgment at all is given unless the balance be weighed down on one side or the other by a third law lord, who is not celebrated for his proficiency in either branch of jurisprudence. No one practises in this court without keenly feeling, and expressing with as much boldness as prudence or temperament will permit, his disgust at a system. by which the decisions of learned and laborious tribunals are reversed or affirmed by two or three old men in a manner which seems to establish conclusively the superiority of blind chance, were it only for its cheapness and its expedition. This state of things cannot last-cannot be endured-must at once be remedied. The properties of Hi MAJESTY'S subjects, their honour, nay, even their lives, mLust no longer be left to the decision, in the last resort, of the worst Court in Han MX srVs dominions. Everybody sees, everybody feels, everybody aclnowledges this, except the persons principally concerned-the House of Peers themselves. They alone imagine that when they have decided the life peerage question in their own favour they 'will have, together with that question, laid to rest the scandal of their administration of justice,-that things will return to their old channel,-and that the public will be content, as heretofore, with hearing Lord CRA.NVwonTH speak one way and LIord ST. LEoNAR's the other, or with the decision given by a third judge, who arrives in time to give his casting vote without having heard the argument. But this we believe is not so. The Peers may succeed in putting aside the palliative, but it will only be to suffer under much more active treatment.. The thing cannot go on as it is, and is not to be settled by lectures on prerogative. What the nation wants is justice. Thatjustice it is convinced it does not get from the House of Peers at present, and the House of Peers have been at pains to prove that there is no hope from them for the future. They' are content with the stadts qo, and expect us to be so. But the only result of all their labours will infallibly be. the entire loss of that appellato jurisdiction which is one of the highest honours and orna- ments of the House of Peers, the well-meant effoits to preserve which they are now so earnest in thwarting. We have a tribunal in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to which the judges are appointed, not by life peerages, but by a rank and precedence conferred for life only, and therefore seldom given except to merit. It is impossible adequately to express the superiority of the administration of justice in the Privy Counell to the administration of justice in the Blouse of Lords, and equally impossible to believe that a condemned abuse, which those who profit by it are daily seeldng to render more inveterate, can exist side by side with such an institutioii. We have two courts of final appeal ; the one is. the best and the other the worst tribunal in these islands. Are we to retain the latter as supreme, and provide that it shall never be amaended ?
The Army Estimates for the year beginning April 1, 1856, are affected in substance by the state of war, and in form by the recent changes in our military administration. As to the latter, they are entitled as above, though compared with the three several heads of Army, Ordnance, and Commissariat Estimates for the current year. They are dated from the " WarDepartment," and signed CC PArurm,"-clhanges which, like the " W. D." upon articles issued from our Arsenals, remind us that we have at last a 3Minister of War. As to the substance of the Estimates, the total increase upon those of the current year is enough to dispel the illusions which Chancellors of the Exchequer are so apt to foster in time of war. It is 6,328,0071. even compared with the high Estimates of last session. The grand total for Effective and Non-effective Services is 34,998,5041., against 28,670,4971.for the current year. As usual, the first vote in these Estimates is for the numbers of the land forces, and they amount to 246,716 men, being an increase of 30,378 upon the estimate for the current year. The estimated charge for the land forces is 10,950,3981., being an increase of 1,611,6571. in the charge for the current year. To take the more noticeable points, the embodied Militia has so well done its work in recruiting the Line that the estimate for it is 285,5991. less than for the current year. It still, however, exceeds three millions. The Army Works Corps is a new creation, and the estimate for it is 408,5951. The estimate for the War Department itself exhibitsa saving, arisingfrom the consolidation. The estimate for Civil Establishments is 514,1411., the increase of 111,8061. chiefly arising firom the greater number of clerks and storekeepers employed at the seat of war and our chief arsenals at home. The estimate for the Wages of Artificers is-915,301l., being an increase of 289,376I. on the current year. The estimate for " Clothing, "Barrack-furniture, and Provisions, Forage, "Fuel, and Light," is 9,886,2611., being an increase of no less than 3,682,2191. on the current year. In " Stores for Land and Sea " Service" the estimate is 4,371,1651., being somewvhat less than last year. The estimate for " WVorks, Buildings, &c.," is 2,044,0G91., being an increase of 656,5691. on last year, chiefly in our arsenals and fortifications at home, the offensive line we have recently taken having naturally directed attention to our means of preparation and defence. The estimate for educational and scientific branches is not much more than that for the current year. Under the estimates for Non-effeetive Services there is an increase of 30,7221. in " Widows' Pen"'sions and. Compassionate Allowances," 34,1101. in " Pensions and Allowances to Wounded " Officers," and 10,9141. in Superannuation Allowances. The sum of 29,670,4971., voted last year, was divided intcU3,'18,O?87 for theArmy, 9,000,1§51. for the Ordnance, and 4,961,6541. for the Comniissaiiat. A few details will show where the increase chiefly lies. The estimated number of men of all ranks in the Royal Horse Artillery is 1,678, against 1,337 for the current year ; in the cavalry of the Line 15,509, against 11,125; while there is an entirely new body of cavalry, 1,518 strong, attachedtotheBritishForeignCorps. IJnderthehead of "Infantry" the estimate for theRoyal Artillery is 21,813, against 17,345; for the Royal Sappers and M;iners, 4,314, against 3,140; forthe British Foreign Corps, 20,201, against 14,950 ; while the new Land Transport Corps musters 9,020, with 24,000 animals. In theInfantry of the Line there is no great increase. Among other items on which the charge to be provided for the ensuing year is considerably greater than the estimate for the current year may be mentioned Staff pay and allowances, other extra pay and allowances, farriery, cost and carriage of medicines and surgical instruments, and allowances to officiating clergymen. An immense blank is left for land and water carriage in the East, not comprised in the service of the Land Transport Corps, against the estimate of a million for this purpose in the current year. Should the war either cease or change its scene, no doubt we shall have to spend another large sum in carriage beyond the resources of our own Transport Corps. There is a growing charge for Aldershott, and our dep6ts of all kinds threaten to cost more than they have hitherto done. On the other hand, it is estimated that we shall have to pay 121,0001. less than last year in the levy money for recruits, and about 120,0001. less in the purchase of horses for the cavalry of the Line ; but there is a new item of 400,0001. in the purchase of animals for the Land Transport service, and 80,0001. for the eavalry and artillery of the Turkish Contingent. It will be observed that in most of these instances the expense has been incurred, and the charge which has to be provided for is retrospective. The charge for field allowance for officemr-a about 80,000Z. rore than last year, while the field allowances lately given for the first time to the men figure in these estimates at 639,0001. Independent bf the above items there is a charge for the Land Transport Corps of 666,6461., against a third of that sum in the current year; and a new charge of 300,0001. for the Turldsh Contingent. The additional day's pay for February 29 will this year cost us 14,1451. As these figures are probably enough for the attention of the most careful and most arithmetical reader, we will not for the present go into the items that would last year have been found in the Ordnance Estimates. What we have instanced will serve to show that we are straining every nerve and sparing no expense to carry on the war. If we have not always found the result answerable to oursanguine expectations, itwillcertainly not now be owing to any false economy at home. The many demands on the population of these isles do not allow of our sending out such armies as our great ally, but nevertheless the British army, for which estimates are made, including Hun M 31'sW5' forces in the East Indies, but excluding the British regiments in the service of the East India Company, 'is no less than 275,079. Nor can it be now said that we have left them deficient in anything requisite for efficiency, not in clothing, or food, or pay, or huts, or means of transport, or comfort and encouragement by allow- auces and extra pay; or in amusement or reli-- gious attendance. One cannot glance over thes3 Estimates without a conviction that the heads of the War Department felt they could draw on the British Parliament to any amount, and feaflemly I I i I used that. confidence. Yet, -when we consider he vast expense of these preparations, even with our unecainpled facilities of production and transport, it is impossible not to see that iBussia, with her imperfect industay, her deserts, her inraense distances, and every harbour clo3ed against commerce, must soon be utterly unable to stand the cost of the struggle, which is a competition not only of life and manhood, but also of wealth, of trade, and everything belonging to peace rather than war.
Lord CAnnIGAN has made his defence, and the public have now before them all that can be said, after a fortnight's consideration, in answer to the report of the Crinean Commission. It is well clearly to nnderstand what his liordship denies. That the Light Cavalry horses perished of hunger and exposure ; that, in fact, the British Cavalry had ceased to exist as an effective force even'-before the winter set in; that, while in command of an important brigade at a post of danger, Lord CARDIOAN lived far a-way from his men on board his yacht in the harbour, are not and cannot be contradicted. Al that the country has to complain of,-the mismanagement, and the consequent rum,-stand fuily confessed. All that Lord CA:nDIGs? has to say is that the fault was not his own. In the usual style of circuitous crimination, of which the country has lately seen so much, he endeavours to shift the blame on all around him. His commanding officer is guilty, his subordinate officers are guilty; he alone is beyond the reach of censure. W'e had a few days since the letter of Lord Lues2, with its insinuations against the Commander-in-Chief, its reflection on the Light Cavalry Brigadier, its allusions to an unseem-ly passage of words between the writer and one of his own colonels. Now we have the General of Brigade imputing misrepresentation to his qfflcers, and accusing his immediate commanaer of keeping back letters to the Commanderin-Cief. The public is tired and humiliated by such wrangling, but must listen to the tale, and probably to many more like it. It will be remembered that four LieutenantColonels commanding regiments gave evidence of the rapid starving of their horses after the middle of November. They represent, vwith almost an identity of testimony, that the animals were without hay or straw; that they had but 2-,lb. or 31b. of barley daily; that in consequence they were reduced within a few days to so wealk a state that by the end of the month they were useless for all cavalry purposes, and that many perished when being led to water. Lord CAPDIQGAN denies all responsibility -and for what reason ? That he resigned his command on the 29th of November, and that much of the mortality must have taken place after he left the Crimea. Some people may think that the guilt of a negligent officer is aggravated by the sudden abandonment of his post when the disasters he has caused are at their worst. But such is not the opinion of Lord CADIGAN. When he passed from his yacht to the steamer, when the cliffs of Balaldava began to lessen in the distance, wlhen Lord L-ucAx and the Colonels, Conimissariat and horses, divisional orders, returns, mud, and squabbles were left behind, and England with glory and fltes was before him, he seems to have thought that whatever might happen afterwards was no concern of his. Colonel DoHEnTy succeeded him, and must be responsible. But, as an Inspector-General of Cavalry, Lord CARDIGA.-N cannot but be aware that even 15 days is a long period of fasting for a horse, and may make some change in his condition. He therefore endeavours to clear himself from blame as regards ule time between the storm and his resignation of the command. To do this he assails the evidence of three Colonels of [his own brigade-SnaEw ,I, DouGLAs, and DomErv. These gentlemen, as well as one or two officers of the Heavy Cavalry, state expressly that the horses had for nearly a fortnight no hay, and only, at most, about 31b. of barley. They must have known the fact, and it was impossible that they couild forget it; unless, therefore, some half-dozen men were in a conspiracy to ruin their commanding officer, we must believe their testimony to be true. However, Lord CABD1GAN declares he can refute it; and to do so produces the reports for several days of Colonel Miyow, Assistant--Quartermaster-General of Cavalry. Those quoted are for the 20th of November and the two following days. They are to this effect :-" The troops have a supply of "barley not quite to the full amount; there is no "hay." " The horses got barley last night, not " quite the full quantity, but no hay." "There was " as nearly as possible a full ration of barley came " up last night, but no hay." Common minds will think that this is rather a conclusive corroboration of the evidence of the Colonels. The Assistant-Quartermaster-General says,-" No hay, not " quite enough barley." The Colonels say, "No "hay,. from 21 to 3 pounds of barley." If Colonel MAYoW's "not quite enough" expresses any quantity larger than what the regimental officers have specified, it mnay surely be presumed that these gentlemen judged of quantity in detail more justly than the Quartermaster judged of it in bulk. There may have been waste, there may have been, as is, indeed, asserted, accidental diversion of supplies. The fact is clear enough that the horses were starved, and we may therefore conclude that the amount of nourishment is more correctly estimated by those who asserted that it was totally insufficient. This is all the defence that Lord CADiesAw can urge against the main charge that the horses under his command were disabled by hunger, and the efficiency of his regiments destroyed. His Lordship's arguments are so glaringly contradictory as scarcely to need reply. We were, however, hardly prepared for his absolute denial that any proposal " was ever made to send dowvn "troop horses either by Colonel DOUGLAS, Colonel "DEx SLis, or any officer of the brigade." As three of the Colonels have deliberately stated that such was the fact, and that the proposal was invariably rejected, the matter is simply one of conflicting testimony, in which Lord CArDiGAN's word is placed in opposition to those of his subordinate officers. In such a case we would leave it to the parties to settle the affair between them, only observing that common decency demands that it should be settled. But, if we may judge from LOrd CAUDIGAN'S own discrepancies, it wiU not be difficult to form an opinion as to who is the more accurate. He admits that a Conmmissariat officer suggested on the 24th of -November that troop horses should be sent down to fetch forage, and states that he declined it, on the ground that " the horses were totally unfit to march seven or " eight miles and then return heavily laden 'with " forage" without a greater loss than was actuaUy occurring from hunger. Thus Lordc CAsxnIoA. wishes to prove by reports that up. to the 22d there was little or no deficiency, and that it would havo. been absurd for the Colonels to propose a remedy, and yet two days later he was of opinion that the: horses were in such a state that tlley could not get to Balaklava and back. There seems a solution of the mystery not difficult to arrive -at. Iaord CARDIOAN saW more of the reports than of. the horses reported on. The Assistaut-Quartermnaster-General's returns, which showed that I the animals must be suffering; but did not state that they were actually perishing, seenii to have received from his lIordship the interpretationt most favourable to his own case. Armed with such vouchers for his adri-i tration, he could afford to neglect the repreenta.X tions which, whether official or private, were, We canmot doubt, repeatedlg made.; It is useless to follow the late General of Brigade any fmrtherinto the reasoningb hich he attemnp to show that his officers have calumniated him One argument he adduces which, like most that he brings forward, teils against him. He says that the Colonels could not have advised him to send for forage, because in their reports of the 16th of November they do not say that their horses were dying. When it is remembered that it waS after this time that the destitution- commenced, and that Lord CADsrmGN quotes no document of a later date, we may judge with what fairness he seeks to defend his conduct. Equally absurd is the argument that his Colonels did not appeal from him to the General of Division. We have reason to mnow in what a temper such an application was received by Lord Luc- in the case of Colonel GBrm, and that officers should not apply for the reversal of their immediate superiores decision seems to us no more than naturaL Totally beside the matter are Lord CARDIGas'S testimonials to hiis own services in Bulgaria and at Balallava. With regard to the latter affair, it had best be forgotten by all vho held any com-. mand there. To cite it in answer to such charges, as the present is as seless in argument as it is poor in taste. Judgment mnst, indeed, go by default if this is tho best anwer that canmb givento the accusations in the report.
Three distinct objections have been brought against the present mode of providing superannun, tions for t'ie Civil Service of the CRowV--that it is a positive breach of faith, that it is a great hardship, ancd that it is extremely injudicious. The first of these is denied by the Government, the second is partially admitted, the third is admitted on all hands. There is, undoubteEly, much force in the statement of Sir CoLNx wAL Iuvvis, that there is no indication in the Treasury minute which directs deductions to be made from the salaries of the uses to which those deductions were to be appropriated. It simply directs that after 1829 a certain percentage shall be abstracted from all salaries above a certain sum-no hint of a superannuation, no word of an insurance fund. But, for that matter, there is a great deal of force in DAvID Hu3r's proof of the innocence of suicide and murder, which is, after all, nothing but the diverting of a few ounces of blood from its natural channel; and how can that be wrong 7 The question is, what was the intention of the deed, expressed or understood ? And what on earth was the meaning of giving a man a place the declared salary of which was, say, 2001., and the actual salary 1901. ? If this was meant as a mere reduction of salary, why not say so at once, stating the real value of the appointment? The method of ostentatiously retaining 101. out of a man7s salary could only be interpreted as a retention of it for his behoof; and, if a superannuation fund is not mentioned, it is assuredly understood by at least one of the parties. Then, as for the hardship of the case, it is partly admitted, partly denied by the CHNcmLxop. of the ExcnyQxuE. It is admitted that the termns on which superannuation is granted may be a little too strict, that the sum to be reserved as suich allowance is probably too small, that the service which can alone entitle one to that allowance may be too long deferred; and that, especially at present, from the double action of income-tax and the usual deduction, it may happen that an increase of dignitymay be a decrease of salary, and that the unhappy clerk may actually perform the feat of gowmng back-, wards. But the mzembers of the Civil Service complain further, that they do not get the benefit of their deductions, that these now amount to 750,000l., without interest, and with interest to nearly a million; while the suIUS which in all have been paid to those of their number who have become superannuated amount only to about 60,0001. The CnAxOELLOR replies,-" You speak of i50,0007., "the produce of 25 years of such deductions; it " vwosi not cover the superannuations we have to "pay in a mingle year-the 800,0001. that we "have to pay this year." So far from being a reply, this is the very head and front of the offence -which is found with the present superannuation scheme-that it is used to pay the retiring allowances of all as well as of those who are mulcted for the sake of it. The Lords of the Treasury make deductions from the salaries of certain clerks, exempt certain public servants both above and below the rank of clerks from these abatements; and, when the clerks complain that they do not get the value, or anything like the value, of their deductions in superannuations-that, in fact, if their annual contributions were funded from year to year at this rate, in 60 years the mere interest of it wVould pay the whole salaries of the Civil Service and superannuations toboot-they are told that at present it is not enough to pay the retiring allowances of the. whole Civil Service. It is surely a hardship that they should have to pay the retiring allowances of others than themselves? True, it is not in the bond that these deductions should be for their own behoof. Neither was it in SHYmOC5:'s bond that he should provide a siugeon; it was not expected that the bond signed in a moment of carelessness and ease should be exacted in dead earnest to the very letter. At all events, the present arrangement is extremely injudicious; there is no defence for it. The natural, the inevitable result of it, is to create intense dissatisfaction in a large class of the community, with whom it is of importance that the Government should be on the most kindly terms, and among whom it is of importance that there shoudld be no private feuds and jealousies. Vhat scheme the Select Committee appointed last night to inquire into this matter ought to propose it would be premature at this stage of the discussion to suggest. One party proposes that there should be no deductions, while the superannuation should be paid out of the consolidated fund, and on more favourable terms than at present. Another party adheres to the Latter part of this proposal, but suggests that the deductions should continue, and go to form an insurance fund, the whole of the proceeds to be given to the family of the member on his decease. We may leave these mattexs at present to the consideration of the commnittee. One thing, at least, is certain-and the members of the Civil Service may accept it as a good onmen-that the Government is prepared to make considerable concessions. Their battle is well begun and half won.

Arrangements have already been made for its production at Dublin, Liverpool, Brad. ford, and other provincial towns. Tsrs AMunDER AT ISLrNGTO.N.-By the zeal and irseverance of Inspector Hutton and Sergeant Townsend, S division, circumstances have been brought to light which place beyond doubt the fact of the poor child, whom they isscovered so horriblymurdered in the cellar of the house NSo. IS, liaton-street, being the ofspring (illegitimate) of the murderess, Celestina Somner. Immediately zfter the ex.amunation of the prisoners on Monday the officers mentioned proceeded, in company with Karl Somner, the husband, to a house, ?No. 4, Peter-street, Hackney-road, inhabited by aLn elderly wvoman, named Harrington. Atnd Ier two daughters. Here it was ascertained that a childaged 10 years, who had beeli under the protection of Mrs. liarrington nearly from its birth, was taken away by its mother last Thursday week, because she declared her inability to continue lon-er the payment of IOs. a- month for its keep, since which time MIss. Harrington had not heard or seen anything of the child. The officers next went to 1S, Murry-street, iNew-North-road (adjoining the house occupied a short period since by Mary 21.N-eil wsho murdfrcd her two caildren there), and found it occpied by- a sister of the prisoner, wvhose husband i3 also a Germw: and engraver. Here they learnt that on the evening of the day the girl had becn taken.from Mrs. Harrington she was brought by the prisoner and keptuntill0o'clock aOt Satlrday nightt when the wretched womantookherchild away,without shawl orbonnet, under thepretext that shehad obtained a pL-.ce for her at a greengrocer's in the neighbourhood. Fimilly, Mrs. Harringt,oi, Mr. Somner, and the police 'went to the scene of the murder, and the former there identified the victim, who Vas lying on the servant's bed in the kitchen, as the same child she had reared from its infancy. The poor.wvoman's tribulation vas very great at the sight, and she repeatedly reprehended herself for having parted with her. She said that the child went by the name of " Celestina Christmas," and subsequent inquiries elicited the fact of that having been the m-aiden name of Mrs. Somner, whose parents are most respectable silversmiths, in King-square, Goswell-street-road. A direct confession of the murder has been since made by the miserable parent, she alleging that tiie act was commaitted with a knife, and that she was impelled to the commission of it by the frequent quarrels vwith her husband, who was olbliged to pay 5s. a-wveek for its keep but at the same time she aszerts it to be her brother's child. l1r. Somner distinctly denies this, and states that 2,. Cd. a- week only ws paid by him by agtreement before his marriage with the prisoner, and that sucp sue was always paid wiollingly by him.

The other instalments will remain as originally stated. "I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, "Your obedient, humble servant, - " G. C. LEWIS. "The Governor and Deputy-Governor of the Bank of England." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. Thle following is the letter of ourPariscorrespondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. It is generally supposed that tho Conferences will not commence in right earnest before Monday next. MIinor points with reference to precedence have, it appears, been settled satisfactorly. The Plenlipotentiaries will take their places in alphabetical order as to coiuntries. ML Walewski presides; and at either side will sit an Austrian Plenipotentiary. Then come the representatives of Great Britain. If Prussia be admitted hers will come after. Then Russia, followed by Sardinia; and at the other extremity of the table Al. de Boturqueney will take his place, with a Turkish M3inister on each side of him. The position of Sardinia in the Conferences is completely established, and her Plenipotentiaries will take part in the proceedings on the same footing as those of the other Powers. As mighlt be expected, many reports are afloat as to the result of the Conferences, on none of which, however, can much reliance be placed. The only thing I believe to be certain is, that Lord Clarendon has come to Paris determined to assume, and not only to assiune, but to maintain, under all circumstances, a high and firm position-one befitting the country he represents. If the English Government has determined on demanding that Nicholaieff, for instance, shall be comprised in the aPrsenals on the coast of the Black Sea which are to disappear, I do not think that our Plenipotentiaries willabate an iota of that demand. It is possible that Count Orloff and Baron Brunow may affect astonishment, and declare that they had no idea of such a demand being put forward. If they do so their surprise can only be affected, as is evident from the modification made by M. de Nesselrode in the article on that siibject. Nicholaieff will probably be one of the first points, and I think the most difficult which -will have to be discussed. It is said that Lord Clarendon is very well satisfied with the Emperor, and according to al appearance there is no chance of the tvo Governments disagreeing on any important question which may have to be considered by the Plenipotentiaries. Lord Clarendon dined yesterday with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, and there was a reception in the evening. The diplomatic corps, including the PIenipotentiaries, were present. Baron Brunow, who had a long audience of the Emperor yesterday, and Count Buol dine to-day at the Tuileries. NE. Cavour has presented an autograph letter from his Sovereign to the Emperor. Count Orloff is expected to arrive in Paris this evening. It is stated that important and very serious news from the United States reached Paris last night. I am not aware of the details, but there is reason to suppose that they are not of the most satisfactory character. The Emperor yesterday received the Count de Buol Schauenstein and Count de Cavolur, presented by the TMinisters of their respective Cowuts, and Baron de Brunow, who was introduced by the Grand Master of the Ceremonies. Count Walewski was present on the occasion. A letter from Constantinople, of the 7th instant, states as follows:- " The Mi3isters met yesterday on the occasion of the dtparture of Aali Pasha, Plenipotentiaryof the Sublime Porte to the Paris Conferences. Aali is to be accompanied, they say, by Mf Bev, Grand Chancellor of the Imperial Divan and arif Bey, 3ember of the Burean of the AmedjL They leave for Paris on 3Monday. " The latest advices from Smyrna mention that the newvs favourable to peace has had considerable influence on the prices of corn, which have undergone for some days a fail of from 6 to 7 piasters per Idlogramme. The price of flour remains the same. " Letters from Enpatoria of the 30th, describe the corps of occupation as in a perfect state of health. The troovs are employed in the construction of roads, and the appearance of the town is much changed. On the 20th the 2d Regiment of Turkish Cavalry had embarked for Yenilale in three English vessels. It was thought that all the Turkish troops were to leave for Asia, but the news of peace will, no doubt, modify these projects. Besides the regular troops there stiU remain about 5W Bashi-Bazoukc The French have taken 1)00 Tartar horsemen into their service. They are well disciplined, and wil be of much use. According to the latest accoumts Kertch and Kinbua are perfectly tranquil. A fire broke out at Balaklava, and is supposed to be the act of an incendiary. Several other fires had already broken out in the same place, but were got under, and this confirms the suspicion that accident is not the sole cause. The most rigorous measures have been adopted to put a stop to these criminal attempts, and the police regulations are applied wvith much severity in all that concorns tEhe permission of residence to strangers." The I12alpenda2ce BeiJe publishes the following letter, dated lVarsaw, the 14th inst. ---. " The mortal remains of Marshal Prince Pask6witsch, after being conveyed, on Friday, with truly regal pomp, from the £'apelle Amrdente of the Royal castle, where they had remained exposed until then, to the Cathedral Chureh, were carried the next day, in nearly the same order, to the banks of the Vistula, and thence to Demblin, one of the estates of the illustrious deceased, 26 leagues distant from Warsavu. It was there the M1arshal had asked to ba_ interred. His family and a great number of high dignitaries accompanied the body and assisted at the last fumeral ceremony, wvhich was celebrated by the Greek Archbishop Arsenin3. The delegates ofthearmaies of Austria andPrussi-, Field-'aMrhal Parrot, Mitary Governor of Braren, in Mforavia, and Colonel de Bosse, Commander of the Prussian Regiment bearing the name of the Prince, have since returned to Vienna and Xonigsberg. The public mourning, during nine days, decreed by the Emperor, ceased the day after the body of Prince Paskc6witsch left Warsaw, and on Sunday evening all the the-tres were re-opened. Our new Viceroy, Prince Michael Gortechalcoff, arrived at Warsaw yesterday afternoon, and to-clay the public functionaries and notable mha. bitants have been presented to him. A portion only of the castle had been hastily prepared for the reception of the Prince, who repeatedly expressed a desire that the Dowager Princess should not be in the least disturbed. ThePrincess wil shortly return to Berlin to place herself again under the care of Dr.Grafe,the celebratedoculist,underwhose direction SilC was when the account of the Marshal's illness obliged her to leave for Warsaw. Nothing has yet transpired with regard to the contemplated changes in the personnel of the Ihigh administration, or the projects lately spoken of by foreign journals. The new chief of the Government of Poland is well known to us Ie resided at Warsaw since 1831 as chief of the staff of the active army, and since 1815 he occupied the post of Covernor-General of our capita It was in that capacity he acquired a thorough knowledge of the wants of the country, which he constantly siadied withf praiseworthy ardour. In his administration of the civil affairs of th h kiiigdom hn was ever distinguished by his16re of justice and a straightfoiward and liberal policy. We may, consequently, congratulate onrslvesonthe choice of the Emperor, for the benevolent intentions of His Majesty with regard to Poland cannot be caried into effect by a satesman more inteHlgent or more conversant with the wvants of the people. last weeklan elhibitionof fine artswas opened at Cracow. For some years 3 taste for painting has manifested itself among us im a very remarkable wanner. We already possess several artists of merit, such as Kossak, Lessor, Kostazewski, Gerson, PiUaty, and others, -vho will some day make a conspicuous figure among the painters of Europe. The new Consul-Genere1 of Austria, IL de Lederen, arrived here a few days ago. Xi. de Lederen was formerly Consul at Naples, and he succeeds, at Warsaw, Colonel Baron de Hein Valdor, who has been elevated to the rank of General, and recalled to Vienna." The following private telegraphic despatches have been received: " HA5MBURG, FEr. 19. "ML Raaswloff, Minister of Schleswig, has resigned. If. Hall replaces him provisionaly. It is said that two other Danish Ministers will also resign." " MADRID, FEn. 18. "From the lst of July nexd the pro-payment of letters will be compulsory. It is said that the Grand Central Company has renounced the idea of tendering for the railuay from Madrid to Saragossa."

Positive news there is none, but during the last day or two it has been rumoured in the city that there have been conflicts between the different confessions in Transylvania. Mly efforts to obtain corfinnation of the report have failed, but my want of success is no proof of its being unfounded, as the authorities would naturally endeavour to keep such a matter from the knowledge of the public. It is related that the troops were called out and made use of, 1ut no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the statement. PRUSSIA. - (FRO-n our OWN COREsrONDENr.) BERLIN, FM. 18. According to telegraphic information which the Russian Embassy here seems to have received,' Count Orloff did not leave St. Petersburg till last Wednesday, and consequently he is expected here to-day. The clever ones here have not only a great variety of sagacious reasons for the frequent delays that have taken place in the day of his departure, but are able also to find a close connexion between his non arrival here and the continued stay of Colonel von MIanteuffel in Vienna. In some mysterious inexplicable manner the magic influence that keeps these two high Envoys at such a distance from each other, and prevents them from meeting here in Berlin, is supposed to be the question of Prussia's admission to the Peace Conferences. I need not tell you that this question, as far as the admission of Prussia to any conferences previous to the signing of the preliminaries is concerned, has been quite settled for fully a week or 10 days, and there is good reason for believing the invitation to her to join in signing the peace will be issued only when the negotiations have come to an end, and the terms of the peace are settled. WVhile the unthinkingmass of the educated here is inclined to take it very kindly of Russia that she should have stipulated, at the protocol signing of February 1, for Prussia's subsequent adnmission to the Conferences, those better acquainted with the march of Russo-Prussian politics recognis3 in it only an "artful dodge' of Russian diplomacy, by which three good objects were gained at once :-1. It made Prussia look like the ally or very good friend of Russia, otherwise the latter would not have interested herself for her admission; 2. It was ieh, boot way to induce the Western Powers to suspect her, and not invite her; and 3. By thus getting her excluded from the community of the Allies. it thrust her into a position of isolation, which would seem open to the possibility of its emerging into an alliance with Russia. These apprehensions were uppermost inthe minds of this Govermmelit last year,when it declined Russia's offer to procuire the admission of -Prussia to the Vienna Conferences, and it was Turkey that subsequently sugested the expedience and propriety of her admission. This time Russia, determined to secure for herself the abovementioned advantages, has done so without previously mentioning to this Government her intention. The position in which the.resolution to be passed at the Diet on theAustrian motion found itself last Thursday, the usual day for a sitting of the plenum, seems to have been that it had been agreed upon and drawn,up in committee, and then, previous to introducing it to the plessum, communicated further to the various States not represented in the Committee, so as to enable them to instruct their representatives on the subject. It is expected that the motion will be brought on for decision next Thursday. The resolution said to be proposed by the Committee for the acceptance of the whole Diet, and attributed to the inteivention of Bavaria between the two op. posing great Powers, will, I have every reason to believe, embody the ideas I have already reported to you as likely to prevail at Frankfort. The Bund will recogniza the Aistrian proposals as a fitting basis for peace preliminaries, reserve itself on the subject of the future. details of the fifth point, and pass over iQ silence the idea of its being represented at Paris. In imitation of Paris and Vienna, Berlin is now also going to have its "Credit Institution," as it is cilled far wxnt of -cbter n1?e; bank- it is not, but At is to be everythingr else ever heard of for prornoting joint-stock-companies, commerce, manufactures; agriculture, rand the welfare of the commonwealth in gene'ral. If will also be permitted to issue its'own paper, bearing interest and payable to beiarer. The MIanaging Committeb will consist of (aW far as the namies have as yet become known) seven of the largest landed proprietors in Prussia, for the most part members of the highest nobility, and nine of the richest bankers in Berlin and Cologne, thus cormbining lauded property and ancestral rank with large money capital end extensive business experience. The capital is to be 30,000,000 thalers, in 15,000 shares of 200 thalers each, with liberty subsequently to increase it to 50,000,000. No difficulty is apprehended in obtaining the Royal approbation and permission, as the project apparently enjoys the fullest approbation of tho Minister of Commerce, whb gave the niembers of the future managing committee a grand dinner last Tuesday. 'Short of permitting the establishment of private banks, with power to issue their own notes, the Minister of Commerce seems to leave no stone unturned to inspirit trade, manufactures, and enterpriseinPrussia; after having procured the expulsion of millions of spurious paper money issued by all sorts of States and c3rporations in Germany and circulating in Prussia, Herr von der Heydt has lately authorized an extension of the Royal Bank, and pub it on a better footing as regards the share- the Government has in the capital and the profits ; we hear also of a Credit Bank being about to be opened in Breslau for the benefit of the Silesians, and also of an institution set on foot by a number of landed proprietors, who propose to raise 40,000,000 thalersbythe issue of shares, and apply the capital to the improvement of agriculture on their owvn estates; perhaps the last two are only the same under different names. RUSSIA. We have received the St. Petersburg journals of the 12th inst. Under the head of " News fronm the Crimea," the Invalide Bitsse publishes the following extract from the journal of military operations of General Liiders, Commander-in-Chief in the Crimea:- " From the 20th of December (lst of January) to the 14th 26th) January nothing remarkable had occurred in the Crimea.

-- ~i- TURKEY. -- rokr OU,R OWN COO1RFPOXDEN'T.1 COlNSTANlWPLE, FE3 7. The official acceptance of the propositions regar 1- ing -the -fourth point has not yet taken nlace... It was expected on Saturday last, the 2d inst.: Tnstead £it seveTrl great councils have been held atth3 Porte. The difficulty lies not so much in the recognition of the general principles laid down in the propositions as in the manner: how these principle3 shouild be proclaimed. The Ambassadors wished hat, Mfter t'e official diplomatic acceptance, a firman embodying them, should be given, which, after being translated into all the languages of the empire, should be se:nt into the provinces in order that all those concerned by the concemsions should have the means of knowing them. . However, the Turkish Ministiy is pledged in the meantine to accept the propositions as they stand. - One ought not to'be surprised that it is rather the form than the substancewhichraisesobjections,forall Ithe pr'inciples laid down in the propositions are, with the only exception of the indiscrimiinate enlistment, alreasly tacitly recognized, and it is certainly not agaimrt-this last that the Turks can have any objection; on the contrary, it would be a boon for the Maliomedan part of the population. Let us take the other points-first the liberty of conscienee and civil jurisdiction. In the Greek relig,ion it was recognized in the very first Berat which vas given by Mahomed II. afterthe fall of Conistantinople, and the election of Georgius Scholarius, three days aft6r that event. The fourth. point of the Berat says, "That the.narriages and social and other usages of the Greeks will be maintained after the principles and rights of their church," &-c. Thus, the rights of tho Patriarch vere greater after the capture of Constantinople than before, for they included the civil jurisdiction over the Rayahs. And this article is includeds nay, more explicitly expressed in the Beret hich is g,iven at the precsent day to the Patriarch after his election. Vhat was contained then in one article is nowv distributed into four,-namely: "Asrt. 3. MIa-riages and affaxirs of divorce belong to9 the Patriarch and to tho respeCtive bishops, to the exiclusion of ever y other jurisdiction. "Art. 5. The Patriarch, metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, and their suffragans, judge all causes bet-can Rayahs, and the cadis and nalbs are forbidden to interfere. "Art. 6. The evidence of members of the clergy has its full effect, according to the laws of the Greek religion. "Art. 7. The Patriarch and his synod exercise, in full liberty, and without being molestod by whomsoever, their ecclesiastical jurisdiction over aU the members of the clergy.", The only ground of complaint they can plead is that of not being allowed to toll beLs, but this scarcely necessitated the expression of great general principles. The Roman Catholics, under the protection of France, have even this right, and the Jews don't want it. So much for the principle of liberty of conscience and civil jurisdiction in their own causes. As regards jurisdiction in mixed cnul-:.-, namely between Mahomedans aud Rayalhs, thoer, exists the real necessity of doingsomethingosp,ocia]lv to remove the inability of non-Miahomedans to comiie forward as witnesses. But, as I wrote to you in my last, and, I think, proved it, this inability is connected with the exemption of non-Mahomedans from culistmnent, and there is no difference maiel betveen Mahomedan witnesses and Christians who carry, or are supposedl to carry, arnis in the service of thle Sultan. As soon, therefore, as the enlistmenit is indiscriminate, the inabilityceases ipsofacto. As for the internaliunmicipal administr.ation, that of uo other country is based on more liberal principles. It is a principle of the :Mahomcdai religion not to nicddUe wvith the affairs of the nonMahomedans; all the commercial and miuicipal institations wlhich existed at the conquest were kept up, and are still kept up in principle. The magistrates are elected-or, at least, ought to le elected-bythe inhabitants; they have the reFartition of the taxes as well as all their internal affairs under their oWnI control; so here, again, no new In l2ciple is asked for. The last point asked for is the principle that nonM1ahomedaus should be admitted to civil and military ' employments. This exists already not only -in principle, but in practice likewise. Let any one who doubts this look to the Tturkish missions in Europe; out of the six, in three of theni the chief is a Greek; M. Mussuirus in Enigland, M. Kiragia at the Hague ; annd Prince Kallimaeki, lately destined for Vieinna, but now spoken of as Ambassador at Paris. As for the personnel bf the missions, the M ajority are not Mahomedans. As for the nilitary rank, I kllow myself several WaliLchians who are majors and colonels in the Turkish army. Nothing prevents any man who has protection, -which he wants everywhere else liL-ewise, to enter either the civil or military service, lf they complain that there is no advancement except by the favou ritisnl of the Pashas, this is a complaint in whicl Malhomedans share just as well as non-Mlahomedans. As on this point, so on every other likewise, it is not the principle which is at fault, but the faulty administration of every branch in the Turkisl Government. and this ought to be amnended, not the principle There are frightful abuses in the ecclesiastical administration, buit this is not caused by the want of liberty of conscience, but by the corrupt state of lhe Greek clergy, who look at tlheir flocks as sheep, to be shorn for the special benefit of theirshepherds. There are numberless instances of oppression by napacious pashas. but is it the Christians alone who are oppressed, or, on the contrary, the Mahomedans, because the pasha has the greater hold of them? The population of the villages have to suffer awfully; but who is it who oppresses theni ? Their owni indigenous Tshorhadji, or cadi, according as the village is Christian or Mahomedan, whom they elect, atleast ought to elect, themselves. The most serious cases occur in this respect. There was, for 'instance, some years ago, one of the greatest villains the chief magistrate in one of the most populous villages of the pashalic of Adrianople. He plundered right and left, and innumerable were the complaints and proofs against him. But as he had a strong party in the place, the Government could not get rid of him in a legal way, that is by his deposition and a new popular election; at last, after four years of continued trial, the Government found no other means in its power to remove him but by exiling him. Iu the begainnmig the people thought all would go wrong becaulse they had not got somebody of the old family, but they soon found out their nistake. A purified administration and a good police are the things wanted, and not newv principles, but the faithful execution of' the existing ones. You know from my former letters that the Loan Commission pressed the Turkish Government to decide in what way the bills which the latter was to draw on account of the loan should be negotiated on the Exchange. This question was not so easy to settle as it would appear at first sight, owing to the peculiar nature of the Exchange here. It is not a free market where bills are sold and bought by competition, but rather a monopoly in the hands of a few Greek houses, wlho regulate it entirely according to their own convenience-depress it when they want to buy, and raise it when they have bills to sell. The difficulty was, moreover, increased in the present case by the circvumstance that these very same houses wlhich had the exchange in their hands were the creditors of the Covernment as contractors forwar supplies which wereto be paidout of the loan. It was, therefore, easy to foresee that they would do all in their power to depreciate the bills of the Government in the market as soon as they appeared, and fthus to obtain them as eheap as possible In this mamner they thought themselves sure to make a good profit not only by their contracts, but likewise by the rate of exchange, or else to force the Government to intrust one of themselves -with the negotiation of all the bills, and to pocket the 1 per cent. commission. The Turkish Government, which has given up long ago the hope to outiwit the sharp financiers of Galata, was rwady to yield, and to pay the 1 per cent. commission, as it had done before. But the Loan Coinmission rejectedthis idea at once, as likewise the offer-of the house of Rothschild under the same. conditions, and proposed, in spite of the threatened depreciation of the bills, toissuethem in the market. The Govetmuent accepted this proposal. As soon !as thlis became kwn in the beginning of last week, a downwalrd tenidency begeiix in the into of. exchange, . whieji increased rapidly';wvhen the Turkdsh Government ixctually brougah t ineto the market a fewf biDVs for a-small sum.; The -pounid ster-. ling, wvhiehlwas 'fluctueting lately betweeni47 and 8,' and worth 150 pinsters inthe-bazeears, fell biydegrees to 1.44. The day: when the rate of exchange had - .n-, 4ihwsfutuit reached this figure the Turkish Government,-ou the suggestion of the Loan Commission, offered tc pay the creditors who had a claim on the proceeds of the loan, at the rate of exchange of the day. The speculators, who, never expected to be p aid ao readily, andwho besides thoughtthattheirbilswould I;e throivn into Vtie market, just in 'the same 'waj'T as the few bills'which the Government had drawn L in the course of the week, readily consented, and continued to depress tho rate of exchange, which fell down by degrees to 140, 138. The Turih Government, however, instead of throwing its bills on-the Exchange, as it had done vith the former: ones, paid the creditors with the bills directly at the,' fixed rate-namely, 144. - . -. You may imagine the rage of the financiers of Galata, who were thus taken in their own snare. In any other place the whole transaction would have been thought rather of the nature of Etockjobbing, but here it is only considered a clever financLial operation. The Government had, of course, the full right to deal with its bills as it thought most' conducive to its interests. There was no promise made that the bills would be negotiated on the market, it was an induction whieh the financiers of - (alata made; besides, there was such a manifest badfaith on the part of the latter, that one cannot' blame those who defended themselves against it -ith all the means in their power; it was a simplecase of self-defence which the lawgivesto every man, against the robber. OnMonday last, the4th inst., the Sultanhonoiured - vith his presence the grand ball at the French Emb)assy, where he remained for hvo houris anid-a-half. Illuminations, gulards of h1onour, military music,'played the ustal part in the festival, E*hich, as it- had been known thaat the Sultan would ome *as: excessively crowded. Sanguine people, who judge. everybody else according - to their - ovn in'-- clinations, dream - already of soir&s dansanlitc at the -Palace of Tcheragan, of bals costuions at the new Palace of Dolma-Bagtshei, although the tired look of the Sultan at the f6te -ought to have undeceived them about the- charum which European amusements have for those who are not bred up among them. The adage " B y a - quc le premicr pas qlti cofi&' is not quite true in this instance; on the contrary, the charm, if there is; any, is that of novelty, which soon wears away. It was just in the same way with the theatre. The Sultan -went there once six years ago, and never went again. The first step ought to be taken s it was meant-asacrifice of traditional ideas freely andc liberally made to European notions from a sense of gratitude and goodwill towards the allies, and, as such, it cannotbe valued too highly, but it ought not to be abused. Other nations may boast of the superiority of their military and administrative organization, but there.. is certainly no people lke the English for organizing, their affairs themselves. What everywhere else the Governmient does, and nobody else, they are ac-: customed to do without its help and interference. - There is an instance of this at present to be found in this place. For all the large number of English residents who aro not in or about the hospitals atScutari or at Therapia, there are no places of wor- - ship, except the small room appropriated for the purpose at the Embassy and the chapel of the American Mission, both of wlich are insufficient, even for those who live in Pera, and are quite inaccessible to numbers of others wvho reside i: the different villages about the B3osphorus. This want of places for Divine service was severely felt, when measures were taL-en to remove it. A committee has been-foraed, composed of the most prominent English merchauts of the place, to buildl a good-sized English Protestant church in Pera. The expanses wvill be defrayed by subscriptions, and you may imagine how high expectations are raised in this respect if I tell you that the cost is esti-: mated at 15,0001., and this is without any purchase of the ground, for there is a piece of ground belonging to the Embassy for the purpose of building an English Protestant church. ?esides this undertaking, another is in progress, on asomewhatsmallerscale, at Ortakoi, onthe Bosphorus. There are about 80 English people residing there and in the neighbourhood, who had no means of attending Divine service. In the beginning of last month this came to the knowledge of Dr. Campbell, then acting as Embassy chaplain, in the absence of Mr. Blackstone. Although it was very difficultfor hin to take a service-so far away, having three every Sunday at Pera, two at the Embassy chapel, and one at the MIerchant Seamen's Hospital, yet he resolved to undertake the taak, and w-ith a little help at Pera he succeeded for two weeks. \5Vhen the chaplain to the Embassy, M. 'Blackstone, rehtuned, finding his work here so much increased, and being physically incapable of taking the very extensive duty, he asked Mr. Stothert, the chap- lain of Her Majesty's ship Queen, to take cdrgeof the people at Ortakoi, -which the latter willingly agreed to do. The English residents at Ortakoi are mostly of the - mniddle classes-engineers, architects, &c. Some of their leading people had brouglit out a gentleman and his wife to educate their children, and this tutor originated a great deal, whichl would have slumbered had it not -been for his energy. They had already begun tomake subscriptions towards raising a handsome. church, and even had the idea of subscribing an annual suim for the support of a clergyman. In order, however, not to be without a chutrch in the meantime, they at last adopted the project to build a temporary church of an early Enlish design, which would cost only 6001., and wvhich will answer every purpose until sufficient funds arrive for a more substantial building. M1r. Stothertsuggested the plan and design of a chapel, and Mr. Wood, the architect of the firm of 'Vood and Co., Galata; not only promised his time andtalent for this object, but has handsomely subscribed besides. lNor were others back-ward in their support. Half the sumn requiired is already raised: one gentleman brings back an orgn from En.land as a present; another has given a large church bell, one of the spoils of Kertch; and all, many of them dissenting from the church of England in some points, are anxious to wrave minor differences to accomplish this commonobject. They hope to have the chuch bell tolling for church in another month.

A FORTuNATE INEG.--AL%ITA, Feb. 1S.-An act ofgrcatheroism wasperformedlast week bythe Rev. Mtr. Robinson, chaplain to the forces. A Mr. and Xrs Evans, with their son, a fine bay about eight years old, nowv stasvmn here, on their return from Upper Egypt, were crossing m a 'boat from Valetta to Vittorioss, when the little fellow, in endeavouring to catch hold of a piece of stick, overbalanced hinmelf, and instantly sank before the eyes of his parents.' lMr. Robinson, whowas following in another hoat, seeing; what had occurred, immediately jumped into the s,s, and succecded in bringing 3im, apparently dead, into his boat.. It w as very rough and windy, and, as he <id not take offhis coat, ho wasq completely exhaulsted. Mr. Evans, the father' of the hoy, feeling much gratified for vwhat the rev. gentleman had done, sent him a check for 50Z., which was at onc" returned. But what ma3es the story the more romantic, but not less true, is, the two gentlemen who have so unex-- pectedly become acuainted with each othei are relatives and members of branches of the same family, bun, in conse- quence of differences vhich took place many years go, they ' had not seen each other since their boyhood, and each wa&' ignorant of the other's residence in the island until this singular introduction.

WRI LIGfT CA VALRY BBrGADE IN T , ' * . - cCRIMEA . The following is Uord Cardigan'e statement in tp*y to the chargos brought against him in the teport of the Cnmean Commnission:- Taxz RuXL 0 CARDIGAIC TO LORD P wANXtN. Portman.quare, Feb. 13 1856. Ey Lordr-In conequence of the allusions which have Sftei made to me in the report of the Commissioners of lnquizy into matters connted with the British Army in the Cun"eo, I conmider it My.duty to addres to your Lordship, as :oCretary of State for War, an explanatiooL of my conduct a*Rere4raniinadverted upon. The rflections upon me are oonTeyed in these words:When the supply begn to fail the Commiswariat officer re0e9eI tO, who apeaa to have done everything in his power to meet the dilculties of the case, proposed, as he knew there was plenty of barleyat Balaklava, that if a detacbment ot the horses were allowed to go down dailT, he would engpge to bring up enough for the rest of the brngade. This lpoposition appear to bave been brought specially under the setice of Lord Cardigan by Lieutenant-Colonel M3ayow, istant Quartermaster-General of Cavalry, who states that his Lordship declied to accede to it, as he had previously dtone wheon a iiinilar proposition was made to him to send She horses dowrn for hay before that supply failed." will nowt, my Lord, proceed to show upon what evideuce it is that this statement is made with regard to my conduct. I wiU commence by tating that the 14th of November i; the earliest date referred to in these accusations, and tlit r resigned the command of the iUght Cavalry Brigade, owing to extreme baa health, on the 28t of the ame mor.th. I beg to tramsmsit a copy of my official resigLatiorL The following is an extract from Lieutenant-Colonel ; ayow's evidence, then Brigade-Major of the Light Cavalry ;kigade:- "For sometime after the 14tl of November no hay was aepplied to the brigade, but a fnU ration of barley. After some days the issue of barley fell off, in consequence, it WAS =nderstood, of the deficiency of transport. The Commissriat officer applied to' Lord Cardigan to have the troop Iorses sent down for forage. When that application was :irst mado the brigade was receiving full rations of barloy, and he understood from the Commissariat officer that no asy could be got at Balaklava. It did not, therefore, appear to bim at that time that it was expedient to send the troop horses. When the ration of barley fell off the applicstion to send troop horses for forage was renewed by the Conmmiss3riat officer, and brought by him (Colonel Mayow) tunder the notice of Lord Cardigan; but his Lordship declined to end them, and they were not sent so long as the regiment remained in front." I beg here to observe thast Colonel Mayow does not stato what the exact date wzs of his chango of opinion as to the expediency or inexpediency of sending down the troop Jiorsie for forage. But I must consider it of great imVortnce, when evidence is given four months after events have occurred, and that evidence reflects upon the conduct of an absent commanding officer, that dates should be accurately adhered to; and the necessity for this is particnlZaly demonstrated by the inaccur.cy of Lieutenant-Colonel 3)ouglas's evidence as to dates. Before I state in detail that officer's evidence, it is right I shouild point out that I have Ci1onel ttayow's own official reports to me up to the 20th, 21s. and 22a of November; and on the 20th ho reports,"The troops have a supply of barley not quito the fuU umount; there is no hay." On the 21st he reports-" The horses got barley last night-not quite the full quantity, but amo hay. The men had their rations." And on the 22d of November-" There was as near as possible a ful ration of barley came up last night, but no bay. The men are welU of for rations." On Nov. 18 Colonel Bayow previously :adc the following report- "The horses had hay and corn yesterday, but not their full allowance ; by some mistake the Artillery got some intended for us. I had spoken to Mfr. Crookshank, wlho is tow gone to Balaklava, and he said ho hoped to be able to supply full rations this evening." I send your Lordship Colonel Mrayow's ofricial reports to 3me, that you may see that my statement is correct; and I beg to point out to you that the full ration of barley was all the cavalry horses got daily, except for short periods, since they Landed in the East; there was very little hay in Bulgaria, a3d the only substitute for it-viz., chopped straw- as supplied with great uncertainty. Lieatenant-Colonel Douglas in his evidence states as follows :- " For about a fortnight after the 14th of November the horses were withoiut hay or straw, and had only on an avere 2hb. of barley per day. lVhiiothings were in this state I made a representation to the officer commanding the Light Brigade, through the Brigade-3ajor, proposing that a certain number of the horsesshiould be sent down daily to bring up forage from llaklak-a, where it was understood that it could be obtained ; but the proposal vas rejected." This statement is supported in Appendix, page 19, by a letter dated Balaklav-a, Deceimber 3, 1854, four days after I jad resigned the command of the Light Brigade, and dated from the camp near Balalava, and not from that on the heights of Inkermann. " Balaldava, Dec. 3, 1854. "Sir,-I have the honourto report that the llthHussars, -under my command, have only received the quantity of barley specified in the margin from the 28th of November to the Ist of December, 1854 (both days inclusive), and no JiY. " I have, &c., "J. DOUGLAS, "Lieutenant-Colonel Commanding 11th Hussars." I beg to state that I.could have furnished some additional information to the board, and I do so now for your Lordship's perusal-viz., a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Dougls, of the 28th of November, 1854, the evening beforo Ir igned the command of the brigade, in which, although the great deficiency of forageis complained of, not one word s said in the way of recommending that troop horses ;siould be sent for the forage. I beg leave to direct your attention to the manner in which this evidence is given, viz. :-" For about a fortnight after the 14th of November the horses were wiithout hay or straw, and had only on an average 2.1 pounds of barley per day ;" whereas the Commissariat reports sent to me daily by Colonel ITayow go to prove that very nearly full rations were issued on the 20th, 21st, and 22d of the month; and Colonel Alayow hinmself states in evidence that for some time after the 14th of November fall rations of barley were supplied. Colonel Shewell states that lie learnt from Colonel Do Salis, tlhen in command of the regiment, that "towards the end of November, a representation was made to Lord Cardigan of the expediency of sending down a certain number of horses to Balaklava to procure forage, but his proposal was rejected." I have already pointed out the nature of the representation made to me by Colonel Douglas, and in addition I have to state that the Commissariat officer of the brigade proposed verbally to Colonel Mayow, for my information, on the 24th of November, that troop horses should be sent down for forage to Balaklava. This I objected to, upon the grounds that the horses were totally unfit to march seven or eight miles (the distance as stated in the report of the commissioners) from the camp to Balaklava, and then zeturn heavily laden with forage, without a greater los of horses to the brigade and the service than that which occurred by the deficiency of forage. The Commissary-General never applied to me officially to send down troop horses, nor was any representation made to Lord Raglan by that department. It mayhere be observed, too, tha' the greater part of the correspondence by the DepLty-Asssistant-Commissary-General relative to the Light Cavalry Brigade was addressed to the Lieutenant-General commanding the division (ride pages 48 and 49 of the commissioners' report). I beg to add that no proposal was ever made to me to send down troop horses either by Colonel Douglas, Cvlonel De Sa ls, or any officer of the brigade; and I would here asck why Colonel Shewell, who in his evidence named me as the responsible person, did not, on the 18th of November, -when the Lieutenant-General of the Cavalry Division gave a variety of orders to the commanding officers of regiments as to the details of the duties of the brigade, and when he (Colonel Shewell) personally asked for and obtained leave of absence to go on board ship-why he did not, if the case -was so pressing, apply to the Lieutenant-General for permisslon to send the troop horses for forage? But this eomision of profiting by such an opportunity on the part of Colonel Shewell, ad the fact that no other commanding officer in the Light Brigade, -when they were assembled to receive the Lieutenant. General on the 18th of November, made any similar oggestion, confirms my conviction that, whatever opinions those officers might have expressed in the month of arch lautbefore the commissioners, they all concurred with me ia opinion in the month of November, 1854, that the toop horses were unfit to perform the duty of carrying the forage. 4&other opportunity was afforded to the commanding efcers of regimenta on the 28th of November, 184, of n y representations to the Lieutenant-General with regad to the transport of forage, when an order was sent -direct tO them with regard to encampment, a copy of which is row transmitted. :wlt' regrd to Colonel Shewells evidence, that officer ttes tast, "if the hors had reeeived their full rations they wOuld not haye sufered so much, notwihtanding *her expoesre to the weather," whereas it is notorious hAt the -OrU itY m-o rs the h.r.% in the Ieavy Brigade 1urig tile morth of Soyember, 185, wa greater thas that ohe Light Beigsde, although they weresom chbetr supplied with forage. Reference is made byColonel ShewelI "to the defcienvy of nosebags, in consequence of which tke grain was laid on the rorad and a great part of it lost I have to tte that every endeavour was mnade by me to obtain noebags for the brigade, without success; so that at last I applied to Sir Edmund Lyons to assist me, irhich was the cause of 400 anosebags being supplied to the Light Brigad, by the kindnesa of the gallant Admiral. I received the following letter on tho subject from Sir Edmund Lyons:- "Her 3fajestys ship Agamemnon, off Sebastopol, Jan. 3, 1851. "My dear Lord,-At length the noeebags are maide; but your Lordship is gone, and I think Iam doing as you would mwih in sending them to your successor in conunand of the light Division. * I was sorry to hear that you haa been obliged to leave this army-obliged you certainly were; for no man fought against the effects of rude canpig-ning. as well as against tho enemy, more manfully than your Lordship-to wit, the heat and privations on the Danube, the cold and exposure before Sebatopol, and the glorious charge before Balakclava. " I have, &c, "'EDarm- LYOmi~" And I will here state that I feel proud of the good opinion of so distinguished a man as Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons. Colonel Doherty gives simiLar evidence to that of Colonel Douglas before the conunissioners-vix., that the horsee only had an average of two pounds and a half of barley after the 12th of November, but which statement cannot bo sustainedagainst the evidence I have adduced to the contrary. Ho also states that 16 troop horses fell dead although led, marchiugfrom one encampment to the other. Although this occurred four days after I had resigned the command of the brigade, I cannot but think that that number has been unintentionaLly exaggerated; but if otherwise, it only tends to prove that for any reasonable number of days previous the horses could not havo been fit to go the distamce, and carry the burdens I have already alluded to. I have now to advert to a very important point-viz., that on the 16th of November I suggested to the officers commanding the regiments of the Light Brigade the necessity of their furnishing me with reports of the state of their regiments with regard to their men and horses, notifying aU deficiencies and grievances which they might wish to represent, in order that I might transmit them through the Lieutenant-General conumanding tho division to Lord Raglan, knowing tho hardships and inconveniences to which they were all exposed, and hoping that the Comniander-in-Chief would order tho brigade to be removed to a more convenient place of encampment. I herewith transmit to your Lordship copies of the roports furnished by officers commanding regiments in the I3ght Brigade; and you will no doubt be surprised to see that scarcely any allusion is made to the state of the horses, and no suggestion whatever made as to the advisability of troop horses being sent for forage. Not having received, after the 16th of Novembor, any acknowledgment of those reports, I addressed a letter to the Assistant-AdjutantGeneral, Lord WliUiam Paulet, to which I received a reply, an extract from which I now forward. I" Camp, near Sebastopol, Nov. 1S,1 54. l 3ry dear Lord Cardigan,-I submitted your letter, and those of the five commanding officers, to Lord Lucan, who ihas them now in his possession, and, I think, does not ir. tend forwarding them for Lord Raglan's consideration. i" I have, &c., To prove further my constant attention to the details of the brigade, I beg to transmit a letter which I addressed to the Licutenant-Generalcommandingthe division on the 16th of November, 184, relativo to the stato of the sick in the hospitals of the camp, in which (after making some slight complaints as to the details of duties of the brigade) I strongly urged that immediate means night bo adopted for them to be sent on board ship. In this, I regret to state, a long delay occurred, consequent, no doubt, upon the unavoidable absence of the means of transport. I have only further to add that, taLing advantage of the private friendship with which Lord Raglan honoured me, I several times urged upon his Lordship the benefit that would be derived by removing the Light Cavalry Brigade to a more convenient encampment; and the brigade was removed to the valley near Balaklava on the 3d of December, four days after I had resigned the command of it, Colonel Doherty having been instantly on my resignation put in orders as my succssor in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade. Having thus, my Lord, given a plain statement of all which occurred during the last days of my command of the Light Cavalry Brigade iu' the Crimea, and feeling that in consequence of the report ofthe Commissioners a great deal of obloquy has been heaped upon me, and my military character has been severely and unsparingly reflected upon, I must beg leave, in a few words, to state what my humble services were while serving with the army of the East, and the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief of the army as to the manner in which I performed tho duties which devolved upon me. On the 24th of June, 185, I received the folowing orders:- " Head-quarters, V s.rna June 24, 1854, 1 p.m. "The Earl of Cardigan will pioceed in person early tomorrow to Bazardjik with two squadrons of cavalry, carrying with him three days' Irevisions and forage, take with him thence the whole of the Turkish cavalry stationed there, and proceed with the least possible delay towards IKara- su in order to ascertain the movements of the enemy. " Forage and provisious will be sent for his party, including the Turkish cavalry, hence to Bazardjik by the direct route early to-morrow. Await his arrival and foeow his movements. "I have, &C., " RNGvLANs." "Varna, June 24, 1854. "My dear Lord Cardigan,-Accounts have just been received that the enemy have raised the siege of Silistria and retreated behind the Danube, but as there seems to bereason to believe that a portion-probably a large portion-have gone down the right bank into theDobrudscha, LordRaglan is desirous that you should in person push a patrol through Bazardjik, in the direction of Earn-su, in order to ascertain the fact. From Bazardjik you willcarry with you the wholo of the Turkish cavalry stationed there, and the Commissariat have been instructed to push on forage and urovisions for the whole three squadrons for three or four days to that place. Arrived at K-ara-su, you will patrol with small parties to the left towards the Danube, until you either fall mawith the enemy's posts or ascertain the direction of his march, and you will send back reports direct to Varna by means of Turk-ishs dragoons, which you had better leave at Bazardjik and drop On the road for that purpose. The patrol wil, of course, leave their tents in camp, and tale nothing wsith them that is not carried on their horses. "You will observe that by this arrangement you will have forage and provisions for six or seven days, as the muleswil be able to follow your motions at such safe distance in the rear of the troops as you may direct. *It is unnecessary for me to remind your Lordship of the necessity of caution and circumasection in the performance of this important duty, or to assure you of Lord Ragla's fuUl confidence that you will conduct it with judgment, in. teligence, and success. -I have, &c., " G. BRoWvs." I received the following letter from Lord oaglan, dated Varna, 3d July, 1854:- " IWy dear Lord Cardigan,-Mr Maxse dellvered to me your report of the 30th early on the afternoon of the 1st inst "1 You had then been at Eara-sn, and were on the point of patrolling to Rassova, where I understood yesterday, from an indirect source, you did not find any of the enemy. You have thus fulfiled your mission, and are now, I conclude, on your return. " I am very much obliged to you for the pains you have taken to carry out my instructions. By so doing you have ascertained for me that the Russians havo withdrawn from this end of the Dobrudscha, and that the country between this and Trajan's Wall is not only clear of the enemy, but is totally deserted by the inhabitants. " These are important facts, which it was very desirable I should be made acquainted with, and I hope that the fatigue that you and the squadrons have undergone in obtiming the information will not prove injurious to your health, and that of the officers and men under yoar orders. " I have endeavoured, I hope successflUy, to keep you supplied with provisions and forage corn. 'Yours, &kc., luthe performanco of this duty the squadrons under my command marched nearly 300 miles, bivouacking for 17 nights in the open air. I afterwards had the light Cavalry Brigade, the troop of Horse Artillery, and two regiments of heavy dragoons under my command and superintendence, at a distance from head-quarters, in Bulgaria, during the period when the cholera, fevers, &c., were raging, and I received his Lord. ship's approval of my arrangements and services in apri-ate letter, which I tranmit for your Lordshiy's perusal. The Commander-in-Chief of the army wrote the following depatch with regard to the cavalry affair at Boulganak the evening before the Battle of Alm "HRead-quarters, :atclsa River, Sept. 23,185t "The English and French armies moved out of their first encampment in the Crimea on the 19eh, and bivouacked for he nht n the leftobank of the Boulganak, the former having previousltwsupported the advance of art of the Earl of Cardigan7s brigade of Light Cavalry, which had the effect of inducing the enemy to move up a large body of dragoons anld Cossacics, with artillery, " On this flit occasion of the Engih encountering the usian force it was impossIble for y troops to eiibit more steadiness thain did this portion of Her Majests cAvalry. It fell back upon its supports with the most perfect regulari under the fire of the artillery, which ws quickly silenced by that of the batteries I caused to be brought into action." His Lordship wrote further,- "Iu the afternoon of the pre-ious day, Ms,jor-General the Earl of Cardigan exhibited the utmost spirit and coolness, and kept the bride under perfect command." lord Raglan again wrote the fbllowing despatch with regard to the Battle of Bala- - " Before Sebastopol, Oct. 2B,1854I of Major-Generat the Earl of Cardigan was ordered to ruave forwardwith the Light Brigade. This order was obeyed in thle most spirited and gallant manner. Lord Cardigan charged with the utmost vigour, attaked a battery which was firing upon the advaucinu squadrons, and, having bassed 'eyond it, engaged the Rumian cavalry in its rear; but there his troops were asied by artillery and infantry as well as cayalry, and necesarily returned after having conmmitted much nava upon the enemy. " They effiected this motement without hasto or confa. aion, but tho loss they have sustined has, I deeply lament, been very severo in offieors, men, and horses, only counter. balanced by the brilliAncy of the attack, and the gallanetry,, order, atnd discipline which distinguished it." The Lieutenant-General of the Cavalry Division, who was a wittiess to the transaction, wroto the following report of the charge of the Light Cavalry Brigade against the Russian batteries on the 25th of October, 1854:- " Balaklava, Oct. 27, 1854. "Tho attack of the Light Cavalry was very brilliant and daring; exposed to a fire from hearvy batteries on their front and two flanks, they advanced unchecked until they reachefd the batteries of the enemy, and cleared thom of their ganners, and only returned when they found them. selves engaged with a very superor force of eavalry in the rear. Mhajor-General the Earl of Cardigan led this attack in the most gallant and intrepid manner, and his Lordship, too, expressed himse;f to me as admiring in the highest degreothe courage and zealoE evervofficer, non-commissioned cificer, and man who assisted." Having made this satement, I now fearlesly leavo the case in the hands of your Lordship and the public, trusting that you vill do me the favour to give it the greatest possible publicity. I have, &c., CARDIGAN, Major-General, and Inspecting-General of Cavalry.
NA VAL AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. The Calcutta, 84, in tow of the Gorgon, 6, paddle sloop, Commander Crawford, left Portsmouth harbour for Devon. port yesterday morning-the former to be fitted for the flag of Rear-Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, K.C.B.; and tho -latter for the Black Sex. The Hawke, 60, scrow blocmship, Captain Ommanney, weighed from Spithead yesterday morning, and anchored at the western part of the Motherban. The Duke of Wellington, 131, Captain Caldwell, C.B., flag of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Sir Richard S. Dundas, K.C.B., Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet, got under way from Spithead yesterday, and tried her machinery at the mile in Stoke's-bay and the West Deeps, after which she re-anchored at Spithead. The Imp6rieuse, 51, Captain R. B. Watson, C.B., had steam up aU day yesterday at Spithead, and unmoored,* but had not left at 6 o'clock (dark) last night. The Falcon, 17, Commander Pullen, went out of Portsmouth harbour to Spithead yesterday, and took in her powrder, &c. The Urgent naval steam transport, Commasider Phillip.3 TEN., and the Tlegraph hirod transport, went into Portsmouth harbour yesterday, from Spithead. The Cleopatra steam transport embarked, at Portsmouth dockyard yesterday, troops for the blediterranean. The steam tender Sprightly, M1r. George Allen, master. commanding, embarked yesterday draughts of the 1st, 3d, 4th, 7th, 2S3d, 46th, 69th, and 8Sth Foot, and carried them to tho hospital ship Britannia, three-decker, in Block. bouse-hole, to await a troopship to take them abroad. Tho Britannia will be temporarily used as a floating barrack. Orders were received at tho General Screw Company's offices at Southampton yesterday morning to immediately prepare for the reception of horses and men the four large steamships enumerated in The Times of yesterday-viz., the Axgo, the Queen of tho South, the Calcutta, and tho Hydaspes. The Argo has proviously been employed in the transport service in the conveyance of horses, and it will, therefore only be necess-ry to put her fittings in proper order. The other three vessels, however, will have to bo provided with the necessary horso accommodation. It is expected that all the ships will be ready for sea by tho 1st of M1arch. These four fine steamers are capable of carrying about 800 horses :nd a corresponding number of troops. Rear-Admiral of tbo Blue Robert Lambert Baynes, C.B., &c., arrived at Sheerness yesterday, and at 1.15 p.m. hoisted his flag on board the Retribution, 28 guns, paddlewheel steam frigate, Captain Thomas Fisher. Every exertion is being made for her immediate departure, by completing her stores and victualling her, and shipping her munitions of w,ar, with shot, shell, &c. Her destiniation is reported to be theo West Indies. Mr. Alfred S. Pratt, late acting as assistant-surgeon, lias h'xad his appointment confirmed by the Lords of the Admiralty, and dated back to January 22, 1855. The Etna floating battery, now being built in the large new slip at Chatham dockyard, is expected to be completed and fit for launching at tho end of about six weeks. A largo number of additional hands have been added to the force working on board this vessel, which now exceeds 200 men. Relays of sbiplwriglits are also working over homrs in order to have her completed by the end of March. The whole of the largc slip is lit up with gas, which is also carried into the interior of the battery by means of guttapercha tubing. Tlio Etna is intended to be one of tho most formidablc vessels of her class. She is to carry 16 guns of the heaviest calibre, and, in order to protect hor from the effects o' shot, and to render her almost invulnerable, she is being lined on the whole of the outside with immonse iron plates, of four inches in thickness, each plate measuring 12 feet 7 inches in length, 2 feet 8 inches in breadth, and weighing between thrce and four tons. She is to be proNided with a picked crew of the most efficient gunners in the navy, and it is expected thatshe wil be ready to sail with the Baltic fleet in the approaching spring. The Admiralty have given directions for a new vessel, to be called the Charybdis, to be laid down at Chatham dockyard, on the slip from which the Severn, 50-gun frigate, was recently launched. A large supply of now arms arrived at Brompton barracks on Monday afternoon frosn the Tower for the corps of Royal Sapijers and Miners. Thoy were immediately served out to companies under orders to embark for the Crimea. The foUowing scrow steamers are being fitted at Liverpool for the conveyance of troops and stores to the East :-Sarah Sands, 1,299 tons (ready); Jura, 2,240tons; Bahiana, 1,530 tons; Her Majesty's ship Resolute, 1,902 tons; and Oneida, 2,317 tons. Her Majesty's steamer Hecla, 6 guns, arrived in the Mersey on Saturday, for the purpose of towing away the new gunboats recently launched by Mr. Laird; and yesterday Her Majesty's steamer Geyser, 6 guns, made her appearance at the same port, with storei and provisions, for the Resolute. About 40 naval volunteers were forwarded last night from Liverpool to London. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Lieutenant J. Berkeley, to the Waterloo; Lieutenant H. Moore, to the Vrictory; Lieutenant J. W. O'Grady, to the Impregnable; Lieutenant R. B. Cay, to the Dragon; W. Dyer, Secretary to Rear-Admiral the Hon. Sir R. S.

Freeman, AssistantPaymaster, in charge, to the Cyclops; and 3. Bremner, Acting Clerk, to the Rodney. MIMIXII On Thursday 160 volunteers from the RoyallNorth Down Rifles left Belfast for their several regiments. This is the second draugnt of volunteers which left last week. Tho North Down stands now only 390 effective non-commissioned officers and men, wanting 470 to complete. The above number of volunteers admits of two of the officers receiving commissions in the regular army. A considerable number of men from the Donegal Militia and Louth Rifles have volunteered for the Line. The Monaghan Regiment have been called ucon again to furnish a further quota of volunteers to the ine. Major Burmester, 59th Regiment, attended at Belturbet on Friday, for the purpose of receiving men who were inclined to e.xtend their services to the regular army. Tho regiment having been assembled on parade, and addressed by Lieutenant-Colonel Foster, a number of gallant fellows at onceo came forward, 48 of whom were finally attested for the following regiments :-Royal Artillery, 16th Lancers, 27th Regiment, 47th Regiment, 59th Regiment, and 1st Bat. talion 60th Rifles. This is the fourth time since the embodiment of this regiment that it has furnished volunteers to the line, having given altogether about 250 in a few months.

"The view over the whole harbour is well obtained from tho interior slope of the Redan Hill, and from other points within the Russian lines. "The day was magnificently clear; every sentry on the opposito side could be seen, every working party watched, every soldier thab was lounging in the sun; occasional shot and shell were sent from the enemy to the Karabelnaia and the town. but otherwise nothing dikturbed the usual appearance of quiet, almost of desolaion. " On our (tho south) side, we looked down on'.the large ruined b3rracks*in 'front, on the inner creek of.the dockyard, tho quay, and-the remains of Fort Paul, the spacious inlet fromth harbour on our left, beyond which stand the rooless buildings of Sebastopol itself. There, also, is the well-remembered long line of pointed arches, the casemates of the interior of Fort Nicholas, of which the embrasure3.in double tier pointed to seaward and away from us. " It juts out into tlhe harbour, built on an inner tongue of land; Fort Constantine forming a similar but more outward defence for the sca approach on 'the north. "Tho seene and feeling of expectation were of great intemt, for.another tangible proof of power and stuccess was to take place, and 106,000b. of powder were in the several mines. " At the hour named a burstsoftsmoke, dark nna' thick, rolled from our left of the .building; . it was followed by another; the hcavy sound-arrived, 'tho stones were shot into the air'.and to the {sea; the explosions of the extreme right and the centre mingled at little intervals inito one drifting cloud, which veiled tho destruction below. " The light of the sun played beautifully on the mnass of smoke, of which the lowrer par;t lay long and heavily on its victimn. The breeze passing it away over the remains of the tOWnI showed that a low line of ruin was all that remained of:tho pride of Fort Nicholas, and one standmngomenace of the harbour lay'buried under its,waters. " The state of the docks has been given in detail in my letters. They are all destroyed, while the earth surrounding them is shaken into cracks; basin, docks, masses. of broken granite, capstans, gates, beams of iron, and of timber are tumbled into-one mass of destruction.

TRADE IN THE EAST. TO THE EDITOR OF THtE TBES. Sir,-The inhabitants of Galata and Pcra, who have hitherto shaped their opinions of the chances of peace aecording to their interests or their political bias, since the departure of the Grand l'izier for Paris was fixed begin to look upon the termination of hostilities as a probability about to take the form of a. fact. Somehowv or other the Greeks, as a'body, wil have it that, but for England, the war would not have taken place; or' clse that, but for our present Minstry it would-havo already ended with less humliationto knsis. Itis, perhaps, natural that they, the maritime-people-of the-Levant, on seeingsuch a sudden increase of the British flag in these waters, should think that England hassoin peculiar'interest in,the present state of things. In the commercial portion of the community hero there are tvo distinct classes, which wiU be very differently affected by the-pace, and wvhose wishes are totaUy opposed. These are-on the one hiasd, the old established houses and native merchants engaged -inthe regular trade of the country,and,onthe otherhand,, the new comers,'whose chief business has-been in connexien.with the commissariat department and transport services of the expeditionary forces. The former, on the.whole, have-not gained so much as might have been expected from the enormous increase that has taken place in commercial transactions, vhile many of them, especially among the native traders, haveseen their former business completely brought to a standstill. - Whatever may bethe disappointment-ofthe Greeks at thcrrepulse Russia h-assustained in her vicws on Constantinople, they .-nnot but hail with satisfaction the prospect of the reopensing of their trade vith the Eussian ports on-the Black Sea. It will be with no smaU delight, for instance, that the 1ly. driote captain will once more deliver at Odesa his cargo of nativo produce, such as oil from Mitylene, honey from Sysa and the adjacent islands, and olives from Aivalli and wine from the " Isles of Greece." Stocks of such southern produce must be very low indeed in the Russian ports. One very important article which has not been seen in Russia since the first year of the war will be welcomed w.ith religious fervour-namely, the famous vino santo, universally rused throughout the Greek Church in the sacrifice of thcHoly Sacrament, an1d which is grown only in Santerm.s Thero are now larger stock;s of that article held in Coustantinople than ever was known before. But accumu. haion of stocks is the order of the day here. Goods are pouringin from the West every day, the warehouses are tull, the Custom-house heap is greater and in worso order than can be remembered by the oldest aenset, the harbour is crowded with undischarged vessels, and prices have faUen all at once below the paying point. Consignees are paralyzd by the complete failure of thc market. A short time ago selling went on to a merry tumo. He was the happy man who had stuff to sell. Now he is tho most embarrassed, and every fresh consignment gives him but new causO of anxiety. It is California and Australia all over again. I ain sorry to say that it is tho British traders wvho will be the greatest sufferers, because it is they who aro the principal purveyors of eatables and drinkables to the allied armies. Having been in the habit of shipping chiefly by steam, their goods continue to arrive and to be cleared by that expeditious conveyance, at a rate to strikse with dismay the most sanguine. One might have supposed that the prospect in the first place, and then the certainty of the reopening of the negotiations for peace, would have served as a warning to stop shipments for this market, but such is not the case to any perceptible oxtent. Goods are not only still pouring in, but fre avices aro being every day received of further consignments. It would seem that there is a sort of intoxication in a continued ria of high prices and. good profits, thc only antidote to which is unfavourable account sales; for it is not for any want of warningthat shipmentshavc not diminished. The antidote, I regret to think-, ill soon have to be administered, for with ale and porter, which are invoiced at 7s. 6d. per dozen, pressed on the market without effect at Gs. Gd., and other articles in no better plight, it is evident that profits are out of the question, and largelosses imminent, especialy as the cry always is, " Sell, sell; don't held r' let the commercial public, then, clearly understand what they may expect as the result of sending goods here; and in eparti cular let those knowing ones beware who think that all but thenmseives will be deterred from venturing in the present state of things. The knowing ones are the majorlty nowa-days, and very mfuch fear that many of them Wil find themselves to be hut dupes. There is nothing to fear, fortunately, for the regular trade of the country ; that will soon recover itself, but with the peace, and even the present prospect of it, must end that feverish desire for shipping goods which has net only not been ordered, but even have been declned. Peace will prove a great benefit to the legit trade of the Ieont. War is an exceptional and unnatural state, engendering an exceptional kind of trade. In going back to peace let us bear in mind that trade must return to peace transactions. Like Mr. Cobden, people here are -asling themselves, "What next?' They concerii themselves, however, less directly wvith the fate of the "sick man" than with the question," VWhat is to be the -immediato result of the termination of the war to the inhabitants of Constantinople ? Are they to be allowed hereafter to civilize the plae or not? Is there any prospect, at least, of Malata andPera getting rid of their iilth, their dogs, and their cut-throats, of having their streets named and lighted, and of being provided with suitable quay and Custom-house accommodation?' l the Turks will persist in wallowing, let them do so for a time in Stauboul, but let there be pressed on the Porte the necessity of permitting some system of municipal organization to be worked out hy which the Frank and Christian quarters may become a fit residenco for civilized men. Your obedient servant. c} Constantinople, Feb. 7.
MIRS THRALE AND HER CH{LDBRN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TUtES. Sir,-I see it stated in Bogerts Table Talk that after the marriage of Mm Thrale with Mr. Piozzi her daughters Lever would see her, and that when she was at a very great age Mr. Rogers heard her say that she wonldgo down on her knees to them if they would only be reconciled to her. I had the pleasure of the acquaintance of the lAte Mr. Pagers, and, as I believe he was in the habit of spealding rath, I am convinced that his "table talk' never did cornpfise such mis-statements as the above. At any rate, I am able to give them s most unqualified contradiction, as they are entirely false. Sy'vfenerable friend the Viscountess Keith, the eldcet of hJrs. Thsisa's daughters, and two of her sisters are atilA alive, and must naturally feel hurt if such a false impression of the r conduct towards their mother should be received even oi- the authority of so ephemeral a publcation as Rof7er98aMe Talk After the return of 3Mr. and Mrs. piozzi from the protrated tour wch- they made after their marge on the continent, VisoountcagEKeith, then lsiiss Thrale, nd her aStes were on afooting of frequent intercourse with MZr. ,ndblrs.

STATE OF TBADE. i1ANCHESTER, Fzn. 19. Thero has been loss activity in the market than on this day week, partly owing.to thia - upward tendoncy of pricas. For Indialthe present rates entirely discourago shupring operations in tho face of -last advices, but T cloths and low printers havo bcon in request, and afair business-has been transacted. In yArns rather more business -has been offected than in cloth. Both spinners and manufacturers are well enrgedto order, and prices are-very firmly maintalned. 3essnm Joln Slagg and Co. report:- ' With thiO exception of 7-8 anud 98 printing cloths and some descrintions of shirtings for-tho home trade, in -which a fair amounit of business is.doing, tho`marketis exceedingly quiet. The excitement of -the early part of last week has subsided.; and for the last'few days, -although manufacturers aro very firm in demanding an advance ;somewhat in proportion to thatrealized on cotton and yarns, itis impossible to seU in' any quantity at higher rates than those current 10 days ago, as buyers seem. quite determined to resist'the advance as oag as possible, and- are only buying to make up amsortifents or to supply pressing wants. The business-of the day is consenently on a very smallscalc, and prices merely nominal.' e Mlessrs. George Fraser, Son, and Co., say:- " The market to-day -has been less animated, but without laving lost-in any material degree the improvenient in prices which was gained last week subsequently.to last Tuesday's market. Our quotations willh bofound generally raisei." LEEDS, FEn. 19. Tho cloth-markets to4-ay. havo been of a rather quiet character, buyers operating wsith le.s freedom than they did on Saturday. At the same timeo the clothiers have not s.hown much disposition to.scll n-eli-made cloths except at prnces above what they asked a fortnight a.e. The consoquensc has been that the actual sales in the Cloth-halls 3iave scarcely amounted to a full average of a Taeday's market. The great advances which have just taken place in the prices of wools .and indigo are viewed in different aspects, and while they have idcdsome activity in the woollen trade, they have also called into action mu ch caution on the part of manufacturers. HTJDERSFItELD, FEns. 19. The demand for woollen and mixed fabries to-day has been very good, and prices have en upward tendency. ~Pnrchases have been freely made, both for the home and thec expert trade. Fancy and plain trouserings, of good and medium qualities, have been in the greatest request.
THE BAIL WA Y BATTLE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TTh3S. Sir,-Permit me, through you, to thank Lord Chandos and his associates most sincerely for their last letter, for they have now settled the following points conclusively:- 1. They have shown that the pretenco of their having roduced the fares against us because we repudiated the acts of our " authorized agen t" never had any foundation whatever; that they knew all along that he never was our authorized agent to make any agreement whatever, or even to negotiate upon any such conditions as he wvas induced to agree to; and that they have no right to complain, and now " do not complain, of our refusal" to adopt the managers' agreements, so far as thev did agree. 2. They do not deny that in so reducing the fares for competition they have deliberately violated a regularly sealed agreement, deliberately made, and, I may add, mainly negotiated by themselves, and not very willingly assented to by us. 3. They are convicted of having published so mnuch of one letter as they thought w ould telin their favour and suppressed the remainder, w.hich proved our ease completely. 4. They do not attempt to answecr the charge of having p-ublished another letter and appending to it a certain documnent or " memorandum" With the obvious intention of making it appear something totally diffcrent from what it was, and adopted by our board when it was not. 5. They tried at first to make it appear that our disavowal of that docuiment in connexion with that letter was the final ground of the competition; whereas it now appears that the competition was ordered and begun before they even saw the letter. 0. They have throughout evaded all discussion of the real question at issue-viz., the propriety of three companies requiring another to adopt the secret agreements between the three, and to e.xclude itself absolutely from competition with them in the west, while they claim to be treated as having equal rights with us in the east. Such are the principles, mnral and commercial, on which this Euston-square confederacy, representing directly and indirectly a capital of nearly 100,000,000., is not ashamed to deal with smaller companies who may havo the audacity to make a stand against them. If railway business is to be carried on in this way, it is of very little use forParliament toreject amalgamation bills. AR the shareholders in the kingdom must sooner or later acknowledge the general managers at Euston-square for their masters. But I am very much mistaken if these gentlemen do not find, the next time Government seeks to lay its hand on railways, that they have done something more than they intended when they began carrying passengers from here to London for 3s. If Lord Chandos wishes for the last word he is now welcome to it. Your obedient servant, ED. DENSBON. Doncaster, Feb. 19.

The case camie before the Court upon a motion for a decree that the defendants, the railway company, mnight be perpetually restrained by injunction-first, from holding any regatta on Rudvard Reservoir in Rudyara. vale, near Ieek, in the county of Stafford ; secondly, froru letting out boats for hire on such reservoir; and thirdly, from using the Tescrvoir for any other purpose than that of supplyig the Trent and lersey Canal with water. By Gth George IlL, cap. 90, a company was formed for constructing the Trent and Mcisey Canal, and the lands to be taken by the company for that purpose were to be vested in the company '- to and for the use of the navigation, but to or for no other use or purpose whatever." By 37th George IIL, cap. 36, the canal company were authorized to purchase lands upon which a reservoir was to be formed for sup ylying their canal rwith water, and it wvas thereby provided that all persons whatsoever should have the saunepowvers arnd restrictions as under the former act. In 1847 the North Staffordshire Railway Company purchased the Trent and Mersey Canal, under the authornty of an act of Parliament passed in that year. In 1851 the plaintiff was, as she has since continued up to this time, thle owiner in fee-simple of a mansion-house, a7eout 409 yards fromn the reservoir,-which formns a l.ake of about 180 acres of water in front of her house,-and of land extending a considerable distance along the margin of the reservoir. She also has the right of fishing over about SO acres of the reservoir, being so ..uch of it as covers the land which was taken by the canal company from her predecessors in title for the purpose of forming the reservoir. Shortly before Easter, 1851, the railway company advertisod that "a grandfofecor regatta" wouldbe held on RudyardReservoir, onEaster2Monday, 1551, to commence " with a grand salute from a ark of artillery, under the direction of Bombardier ing, of the Royal Artillery MIanchester," and that a steamboat would ply for hire on the reservoir or lake during the day. The plaintifs solicitor remonstrated with the defendants on the subject of holding such regatta, but nevertheless it took place. The defendants again advertised that a regatta would be held on the reservoir on the ensuing Whit Monday, and the plaintiff thereupon instituted this suit for an injunction to prevent its being held. In July, 1851, the motion for aninjunction came on for hearing, but, the defendants having undertaken not to do any of the acts complained of by the plaintiff, the motion wsas directed to stand over, with liberty to the plaintiff to bring such action as she might be advised. An action on the case for a nuisance was accordingly bronght by tho plaintiff against the defendants, but on the rial in Augast, 1851, the jury could not agree on the verdict. A new trial was then had in February, 1852, when a verdict was returned for th plaintiff, with nominal damages.

MralIey and Mr. Petersdorff were counsel for the plaintrit and MIr. 3fanisty for the defendant. The plaintiff was a builder and surveyor carr7ying on businmse at Sydenham;bealsowas inbusiness as anupolsterer, which was carried on by his wife. The defendant was a large distiller in Cullum-street. The action was brought to recover damages for an injury which Mrs. Hunt had sastained by reason, as was alleged, of the negligent drivin of the defendant's servant. On the 3d of November M. unt wasinaphacton, which vas driven byher foreman. As they were driving along Moorgate-street, and passing a dray which was standing close to the pavement, the defendant's waggon, drawn by three horses in `unicorn" fashion, met them, and ran aginst the phaeton, and the effect of the collision was to throw the foreman over the head of the horse, and to cast Mr Hunt down under the dray. She managed to scramble up, but was very much alarmed. She was carried into a shop, and a medical man saw her and placed her in a cab and sent her home, and her own medical man was sent for, and attended her for a lon time. She still suffered great pain,;and passed a good deal of blood, denoting internal injury, and her memory wasvery 3nuch impaired. The object of the driver of the waggon appearedto be to paasan omnibus which was going along 'before it. The waggon was going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour. The phaeton was crushed to pieces. The driverof the waggon was seated on a box driving with reins. The phaeton was going at an ordinary rate, The case was proved by several -witnesses. Mr. YMALLEY, insumming up his evidence, observedthat the driving of a heavy wagon at such a~ Dae was of itself negligence. These drivers drove reckletly along, Inowing that' the vehicles they drove would not be injured by anything theyran against. It was known to all drivers that a unicorn team, as it was called, was the most difficult driving. Vehicles of this descriptionought nottogoat so fast p ace. It was almost as easy to stop a steam enogine as to puul up these heavyhorses, which were now so generally driven along the streets of London at a faster pace than most carriages. They all knew that it was easy to pull up light horses drawin light vehicles, and all knew the almost impossiuilityo stopping these heavy waggons, with which London mow abounded. The jury would give damages for the injurythe plaintiff had sustained, ard for the loss of her ser-vices, ana also for the damage done to.the phaeton. Mr. MmMusTY, for the defendant, said they were all glad to findthatmrs. Hunthadnotreceivedanylasting injury. fe had not called witneses, because he felt that in all these eases where evidence of negligence was given for the plaintiff it was utterly uselems to waste time by putting witnesses Into the box for the defendant.. He should, however, in this case sak the jury to give a verdict for the defendant, riaiinuch as he submitted that the phaeton had no right to attempt to po5 the dray, and it as negligence in tho driver of the phaeton m attempting to do so. He was sure his friend dia notaean to sythat these heavy. three-horse rhi4swaere to be swept away. When the driver of the phaeton saw the waggon coming he ought to have pULld up. , Mr. Junice CRoTo summed up. The fdrt quesion ws whether the accident had arien through the negligence of the defendant's driver, and whether there was negligence on the pasrt of the plaintfi s rm. Wo doubt these heavy vehicles drawn by theae unicorn team were frequently very dangerous things. If they.considered the. plaintiff entitled to recover, they would say what damages they would give to the wife for the injury and pain she h-d sustained, and they would give the husband damages for the loss of the assistance of his wife, and for the expenses to which he hed been put. They weuld say whether there was negligence onthe part of th:e deFendant and whether there was any on the part of theplaintiffW The juxysad, in their opinion, therewia no negligence on the par of the plain*i and therefore .their verdict would befrthepLainfffand.they gave 251idarnigestothewife| and751 tothehnsand-ltogether lOW. nREVAI V.

A person of the name of Silcock had married the niece of the plaintiff, a widow lady residing at Stockwell; he lived in the house of the plaintf,and the defendant had seized the goods that were in the house under an execution against Sileoclc1 and the question was whose goods these were, whether they belonged to the plaintiffor to Silcock.

I COURT OF Crnr%vN PT.AS. AO.nM TBT E M. I9. HURST V. USEOBSSL (Bef3ore Lod Chief Justice Jravis and a CommonfJury.) Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mx. Unthank were counsel for the p7aintiff, and Mr. Wilde and 3ir. Blackburn for the defendant. This ws an action on a charter-party or. the ship Elizabeth, -which belongs to the plaintiff, a shipbuilder at Ramsgate. The defendant is a cornfactor in Mark-lane, and in ;September, 1S54, entered into the charter-party for the vesse to take a cargo of grin from Limerick, to be shipped by his brother, a confactor there. In the ordinary course the vessel ought to have performed the voyages on which she was then engaged Eso as to be at Limerick in 50 davs, but, owing to damages received by bad weather gnd a collision, she did not reach that port till after 200 days had expired, when the winter, the usual time for shipping corn, was past. She had, moreover, owing to her being repaired after a gale, sunlk from Al to black £P. Underthese circumstances the defendant refused to ship any corn on board, whereupon the plaintiff brought this action for freight and demurrage. The COEr JusrsE *was of opinion that, inasmuch as there was no stipulation about time, and as there was no warrants about the vessel being A 1, the defendant was not excused from the performances of his contract, and his Lordship therefore directed a verdict for the plaintiff. It was agreed that the amount of damages should be settled out of court.
(nTrR! AR P V4l (TrTM 1- irf THE o'-,. F. 1L FITZlADrIS-GE BERME V. BRltEFOiD AND OTHERB. (Sttings at ie2iPria; before th CIIr BMRox andcZ Specic4 Jurics. at GuildhallA The Attorney-General, lir. Edwin James, and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiff; Sir F. Thesger, Mr. SerjeLut Wilkns, and Mr. Tomlinson were counsel for the defendants. This was an action of libel, to which the defendants pleaded not guilty and two pleas of justification as to parts of the alleged hbels The AT ron.%-GEsGmAL stated that the plaintiff was one of the members for the city of Bristol, who came forward on the present occasionto complain that the defendants, who are the publishers of the Alliance, a weekly newspaper, had caused to be inserted therein a series of articles grossly and unjustif6ably reflecting on his conduct as a member of Plarliament. In 1854, as might be remembered, an act was passed to impose certain restrictions on publichouses on Sundays, as recommended by a committee. After that the constituents of the plaintiff enlisted his opposition to that act, as calculated to prejudice Bristol, which was the resort of frequent e:;c-rsion trans, by showing that the asengers by such trains frequently found themselves in that city without the means of procuring ordinary and necessary refreshments. Upon this the plaintiff, desirous of protecting the interests of that city, and thinking that the act in question ws calculated to carry matters too far, moved for a commlittee to inquire into the working of the act. That committee was constituted in the usual way, the custom of the House being that the mover should take upon himself the nomination of the members, after consulting his friends and the Government. The plaintiff then requested Sir GeoTge Grey, the Secretary for the Home Department, to name certain of the members, and proceeded to name the other members, and among the names so selected by the plaintiff were the introducers of the act of 1854, who, however, both excused themselves for private reasons. It ws impossible, therefore, for the plaintiff to form a committee on fairer principles than those he soadopted. It embraced men of all shades of political opinions. It met in due course, when the plaintiff was lected its chairman, though he suggested some other gentleman for that office. Now, it is the duty of the chairman to arrange the evidence, but not to select the witnesses. That is the act of the committee, and the first thing they did was to call the whole body of metropoEitan 3mastratecs, whether favourable to the bill o 1854 or not and, after examining a great body of evidence, the committee came to the conclusion-to which there was only one dissentient-that, however desirable it might be to impose some restrictions on publichouses, the bil under examination was too rigorous, and they reported accordingly, the report being drawn up b a aember who was opposeAt in poei-tical opi)ion to tue p aintiff, anm whom he (the AttorneyGeneral) was now prepared to call for the purpose of showing that the committee had been fairly constituted. Great therefore, was the surprise of the plaintiff when he found that his conduct in this matter ben made the subject of attack in the Allivace newspaper, which was established as the organ of a party having in view the promotion of the strict observance of the Sabbath. That was a question on which every man was entitled to form his own opimon, which he should be allowed to advocate to the utmost of his power; but that liberty would not justify any one in makin- unfair personal attacks upon the motives of a member of 0Pariiament who took a different view of the same subject. The plaintiff, however, soon found himnself to be the object of a series of leading articles in this paper which charged him with gross corruption in the discharee of his duty on this occasion as a member, with packing the comoittee, and with unfairly caling one-sided witnesses before it. These were charges of so serious a character as to warrant the plaintiff in seeking to vindicate himself. Sir F. THESIGEG here rose and stated that he had been most anxious on the part of the defendants that the jury should bear from his learned friend what the plaintiff complained of, and he was happy to say that it would not be his duty any further to trouble the jury. It had been correctly stated that the Alliance papar had been established by an a'sociation of people, with the view of promotmg habits of temPerance and observance of the Lord's-day. The bil of 1854 had naturaly excited the opposition of the Licensed Victuallers and other parties, who had applied to the plaintiff, through whose assistance a Select Committee had been appointed by the House of Commons. Now, it was not his (Sir F. Thesiger's) desire to be understood to cast the slightest reproach on that committee or its report, which had been correctly described as almost unanimous, and upon that report the plaintiff had introduced a blll to alter the law of 1854. Now, it was clear that just so far as the Alliance thought that law was advantageous to the best interests of the public, so far its conductors would think that the biU of the plaintiff was calculated to do the very reverse. They were therefore at lberty to oppose the plamtiff and his bill with aU justifiable comment and argument. But they had not stopped there; they had unfortunately exceeded the limits of fair criticism, and, hurried away by their zeal for the cause they advocated, they did certainly impute to the plaintiff improper conduct, coUusion wiLth the LicensedVictuallers and unDue partisanship in the discharge of hispublicdutyasa member of the legislature. It must be admitted that no one had a right to go so far, but it was butfair towards the defendants to state that their opposition to the plaintiff was a little sharpened by his comments on them and their partq, which were not of the most forbearing character. This cud not, however, justify the defendants, and they now felt it was their duty to withdraw thus publicly from the imputations on the plaintiffs personal character and conduct, of whi,ch he now complained, and to apologize for them through him as their counseL. They, therefore, did withdraw them. The ATroNY-GENssE was ready, on behalf of the plaintiff, to accept the apology of the defendants now tentered by Sir F. T hesiger, as their counseL. He must, however, observe that the expression "hurry" did not apply to or excuse the conduct of the defendants ; for the libels coomplained of were repeated week after week. Sir F. TmEsGEIL-It was not till the last article that they imputed corruption, and itwas to that which I applied the expression. The AnromN=-GENsE -That was so, and it appears that the articles got worse and worse. However, the plaintiff had only sought the vindication of his character, and, having attained that object, he was content. No one was more impressed with the nght of every one to comment on the conduct of public men thanwas he(theAttorney-General), but there were limits beyond which that right ought not to be carried. The defendants having admitted their error, the plaint-iff was satisfied with that admision, and wouald accept averdict with nominaldamages-say, 61. 6s.-in proof of his sincerity. The jury thereupon returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with S. 6s. damages. nBUN-n V. urTPy. Mr. BoviU and Mr. Cleasby were counsel for the plaintiff - 3Mr. Watson and Mr. H. James appeared for the defendants. This was an action to recever 176L. as the balance due on a contract for the purchase of a quantity of cocoanut oil sold by the plaintiffs, through their brokers, to the defendants. The question in the cause was whether the expression "revenue tare" used in the contract bound the defendants to accept the weights and tares branded on the casks, and mentioned in the weight notes, or whether, as they contended, they were at liberty by the custom of the trade, if they thought proper so to do, to q:uestion those weights and tares, and to ascertainthe real and fair rates, by "turning out" some of the casks, and taking an average tare from suLch examination. These conflictmg constructions were supported by several witnesses caUed on both sides, and the jury, after a lengthened trial, inclined to the side of the defendants, for whom they ultimately returned their verdict.

The affecition of the deceased for CaptairiParfitt and his wife was verygeatv as proved not by one wins only, but by all who hdbeen examsined in the cause. She had alwaYs treated Mrts. Parfitt with maotherly or sisterly regard;' andl after her marriage took great interest in Captain Par-' fitt?s vessels, and frequently masde pleasure-trips in them. She had received great kindnVess from both the captain and his Wife, particularly during her last illness, and hEence she deterindto confer upon them a greter testamentary benefit than she had done by the will. Her intercourse with haer sisters was extremely limited. Dr. ADDAM~ (with whom was Dr. SpLiine) saidl he appeared for t-he executor under the will, -who, with his coexecutor,though he had no *rsat .euir interet thought it right to o~prse the codicils.

Captain Parfitt ancl his wife had shown her great kindness, and she desired to increase her testamentary bounty in their favour. Perhaps she had carried it to a greater extent than mightlave been desirble, but it was not in the power of the Court to snake a will for her.

I MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, ntaday, Feb. 19. (Bcfore the ASSISTANT JUDGE.) George Moorroft, 47, wsas indicted for having sto]en 31b. of vermilion, the property of Augustus Eibbock and others, bis masters- and John Seriesut, 63, was indicted for feloniously receiving the same, knowing it to have been stolen. Mr. Parry prosecuted; AIr. Ribton defended Serieant; the other prisoner pleaded " Guilty." It appeared that the prosecutors carry on the business of varmsh and colour manufacturers, inUpperEastSmithfield, and thQ prisoner Moorcroft had been for some time in their service as porter and warehouseman. In consequence of circumstances of suspicion which attached to him, a communication was nade to the police, and Sergeant Foay, o. the H division, was employed to find out upon what ground such suspicion rested. He found that the prisoner Serijeau was in the habit of lurking about the warehouse early of a mornming, and holding conversation with the prisoner in bypl;ces. On the 4th inst. he watched them into a public house, where Moorcroft handed a small parcel to Serjeant and they then separated. On the 8th the same thing wa; repeated, and Foay intended then to have taken Serjean' into custody, and was following him for that purpose, but lost sight of him in a string of carts and carriages. On the 12th he saw Moorcroft hand to Serjeant a small parcel, and, on asklng him what it contained, the officer was informe t that it was vermilion, and that he (Serjeant) had bought i- for 5s. of a mua in the street, whom he did not know. This conversation took place at some distance from wher; the parcel passed from one to the other, the officer havin followed the receiver. It was proved that the prisoners were old acquaintances. Serijeant gave his address correctly, 3, ew-court, Goswell-street, and on going there the officer found a quautity of blue, which wras of the same quality and description as some on the prosecutor's premises. ;Mr. gBraolf addressed the jury for the prisoner Serjeant, and called witriesses to character. One of them, stated that he (prisoner) was aWaterloo The jury found him Guilty. The ASSIST -zT4UDGE sentenced each of the prisoners to 12 months' hard labour. John Taylor, 44, and Robert Taylor, 39, butchers, were indicted for having stolen U sheep, the property of John 3.Eason. Mr. Mason, the prosecutor, is a farner at little Stanmore, and one day in January he had 20 sheep in a field at ilburn, of which were stolen therefrom by some one. The prisoners took 11 sheep to Mr. laws, butcher, lXorland-road, Shepherd's-bush, and asked permission to leave them there that night, as it was dark and raining, and they had brought them a long way from the country. The permission was granted, and on the following morning they made their ap. pearance andrequested to Id them there. This was done, and Mrr. Laws bought a portion of the carcases, the prisoners taking the remainder away in a cart which was hired for the purpose. The prisoner John left two sacks contaiumg 11 sheepsidns at a place in Whitecross-street, and, suspicion being excited, they were given to the police, and after some investigation they were ascertained to be the skins of the sheep stolen from the field at Rilburn. John said he bought them out of a country cart in the Old Bailey; Robert thzt he assisted in dressinz the sheep at Shepherd's-bush, but that he was ignorant of the robbery. The prosecutor identilied thesinsbyhis own brand, and also by the peculiar breed of the sheen In his defence Robert Protested that, though he was engaged in the dispossl of the sheep he had not the least idea that they had been dishonestly o tained. The jury found him Guilty. Some observations were then made as to the readiness of Mr. Laws to receive the sheep. Mr. Mason complained of the serious loss he had suFtained. Mr. RrTOn was instructed to say there was not the least ground for imputing anything to Mr. Laws, who was a most respectable man. The ASiSTA.T-JuE said there was no charge before the Cou affecting Mr. Laws; and he could not, therefore, hear anything more said. The offence itself was a very serious one, and he should take time to consider what sen. tence he should pronounce. John Scrivington, 21, militiaman, was convieted of a robbery with violence on William Must. In July, 1852, ho was sentenced by this Court to 7 years' transportation, but the term was reduced. Mr. rAslsY now sentenced him to 6 yeas penal servitude. (Before Mir. Wrmis.) Martin Breen, 28, was indicted for frandulently obtaining by false pretences from George Argent a watch and chain and the sum of IL 5s. 6d. with intent to cheat and defraud him thereof. The prosecutor stated that he lived at Pio. 30, Nelsonstreet, City-road, and on the 4th of the present month, as he was proceeding homeward, ho was accosted by the prisoner and another man. The prisoner said to him, "Young man, wo have just come ashore, and have got with us'a few nice cigars, and, as we are in want of money, we will sell you them cheap, if you like." They were in the garb of sailors. He told them be did not smoke, and did not therefore require cigars. Theprisonerthen aid, "If you will cmos over the way we have got some more tuings re lA't >rought from abroad which we waint to sell, as we'are hard up for money." One of thenipulled~out a chain, which he sad was -gold, and worfhi al 10 by wreight, and the other pro-. duced a'wntch, which he atserted was a chronometer, worth 61.lOs. Altersornefurther conversation they inducedhixnto go home and get some money, and they all then went to a publichouse, where they had drink, and the an# not in eustody produced a shawl, which he said coot 16s. 6d1 duty per ounce to bring it ashore, and was made of came's hair and worked by Chinese nuns. Tho shawl alone, they said was worth 51., but, as they were hard up, they would sell him shawl. chronometer, chain and all for 61. lQs. Prosecutor said he had notso much as that, and after some baigaining it was agreed that he should give them his own watch, a silver hunter, and guard chain, and 1. 5s. 6d. for the watch, shawl, and chain they had shown him. He did sO. The guard chain of his watch alone was worth 4. The articles he received in exchange were proved to be almost worthless, and the shawl, instead of being of Chinese manufwture and made of camel's hair, was amixture of wool and cotton andinade in England, Itwas worth about Gs.; the chain wasa bras one gilt, and the watch was one of a descrption which could be bought by the gross at about 7s each. The prosecutor gave information to the police of the fraud, and the prisoner was traced oat and apprehended by lInspector Brennan.l The jury,satisfied with thoe eidence as to the prioner's identitv found him amft tl,onnd Hr.

POLICE. GUILDHAL-Francis Samuel Shuttleworth, alias Johnson, alias Smithers, alias Mitchell, and a host of other aliases too numerous to mention, vas placed at the bar before Alderman CVBrrT charged with uttering forged orders for the delivery of goods, with intent to defraud Messrs. Wood, of atling-street- Messrs. Caldecott, of Cheapside; Messrs. Coster, of .ldermanbury, hessrs Mars, of Bermondsoy; and a great number of most influential firms in the city, there being upwards of 50 cases in which the prisoner had obtained goods uponforged orders -within the last few months. The evidence being complete, he was committed for trial upon five separato charges. MAIsLo0oUGn-sTRrn--Mary Bramwell, of No. 3, Little College-street, Chelsea, a respectable-looing young woman, was brought before Mr. BanGox, charged with drowning her infant child in the Serpentine. Police-constable A X said, the dead body of an infant apparently about seven months old, was on Wednesday last found in the Serpentine under suspiciOUs eircmnstances. From information ho received from Superintendent Parsons heproceeded to the SunpubliEc-house, at Knightsbridge, and apprehended the prisoner as she was coming out of the house. He told her he was a police-officer, and apprehended her for drowning her child in the Serpentine on Tuesday evenmg last. She rephed, "I did not do it." He said to her," You know who did it," and then added, that she need not make any statement to him unless she liked. The prisoner sail she was sitting on a seat in hyde Pa-kon Taesday evening crying, and with her infant in her lap, whenL a gentleman came up to her and asked her what was the matter; she told him sIe had had a child by a young man; that she was totally destitute, and had nowhere to jo to. The gentleman said-"Oh! give me the child - Ill relieve you of that burden." Shegave theinfant intoishands, when he gaveherashihing, audtook the childvaway,leavingher sitting near the Marble Arch. When the charge wasentered at the station-house, and read over to her, she repeated her statement. The prisoner said she had been in the workhouse for several nights, had slept there on Monday, and left on Tuesday. An inquest had been held on the child, and the verdict was "Found drowned.' John Parsons, one of the Royal humane Society's me, proved finding the body in-the Serpentine on Tuesdayw Mary Wheeler proved that the prisoner gave an infant to her daughter-in-law to nurse, but took itara awn n a h was unable to pay for its nursing. ygii sh Remanded for a week. ILutssno.-Mr. John Robrs licensed victualler, and landlord of the Sol's Arms, Hamupatead-road, wvas charged with assaulting John Webb, a serg-eant of the 88th Regiment of the Line (the Connaught Rangers), and with stealing his bayonet. Mr. BROUGHTRON., previous to the examination of witnesses, asked what sort of house it was, when T'he defendant said that he had been'in possession of it about 19 years without a complaint; and Sergeant Eastlake, S 2, said that charge had been received from the house. The complainant then, having expressed a wish that all witnesses should be ordered out of court, which request was complied with, stated that he had an order ftrm the depOt at Winchester to proceed to London in search of a deserter. He arrived the previous evening, and applied at the Albany, police-station of the S division for a biUet order. He received one directed to the SoPs Arms. He went with it about 8 o'clock. After delivering it he left, and was absent an hour. At 9 o'clock he returned, and went into the taproom. Albout 11 o'clock, thinking it time to retire to his bed, he went in front of the bar for the g7urpose of letting the defendant know his intention. IHe ad half a quartern of gin. When he ordered it the defendant remarked that he would not have a soldier in his house. He observed that he would give him a shiHling. Complainant told him that he dare not taLe the money. He then struck him (complainant) on the nose, the effect of which was to knock his shako off. He at the same time observed that he would knock his head off if he did not leave his house. He turned round to two women in front of the bar and observed to them that he would remain. While his back was towards the defendant he took his bayonet from the scabbard. His nose bled. He had not seen the bayonet since. That was flung into the bar. parlour. After that defendant laid hold of him and tried to turn him out. A scuffle ensued, in the course of which two butchers came in, when the defendant went into the bar parlour. He was then forced out by the butchers, assisted by another nan. Complainant saw a policeman, and gave the defendant in charge, but he objected to take him mto custody. MIr. BxouGnTroN.-On what grounds did he object? Cdmplainant.-He wanted some instructions how to act. He returned at 12 o'clock, when he took defendant to the station. Mr. BxouGssros.-Did you give the butchers into custody? Complainant.-I did not, Sir. The complainant further stated that while he and defendant were struggling they both fell, and that the butchers then interfered. The defendant also put his hand into his mouth, and bit it. The marks of h teeth were still visible. Jesse, an officer of the court, by direction of Mr. Broughton, examined the hand, and stated that the marks were visible. Defendant observed that the sergeant could have had a comfortable bed and lodging at 300 yards from his house, where he had sent many billets, and complained of being charged with a felony when there was no pretence for it. He denied striking the complainant, turning him out, or calling any one to his aid. MEary Anne Jennings, a married woman, who described herself as a dr-essmaker living at NSo. 38, WVhittlebury-street, corroborated the evidence, addinug that the defendant, after he knocked off the complainant's shako, put it on a partition behind the bar close to the door. This was taken by a 'woman who was in witness's company. When defendant had hold of the complainant's bayonet he remarked, "Now I am two to one with you." She did not see the sergeant strike defendant. She saw the butchers come in. She knew them. One was MIr. Brooks and the other one of his men. One of them pulled complainant by the hair of his head. She said to Mr. Brooks i' You are a very bad man," when he pushed her against the bar, Defendant observed that no quLestion had been put about the character of the witness. Mr. BRouaGnoN.-She says she is a married woman, and she is a legal witness. Emma Bloomfield, a shoebinder, who was in the company of the last witness, stated, in addition, that when the complainant's hand was in the defendant's mouth either the landlady or barmaid screamed out, and one of them tookdefendant away. She believed that the butchers were fetched in. Acting-Inspector billes, 5 41, said that when defendant was brought to the station he could not say that he was in nor; he was very mauch excited Vefendantobservedthat the treatment he received was enough to excite him. He was assaulted, some of his hair ivaspulledout of his head,and he bad a blackeye. He did not take the bayonet with a felonious intent. The sergeant struck thebayonet with his stick, giving him (defendant) an opinion that he intended to draw it. On that account he took it away. Sometime ago amilitiaman drew his ramrod from his musket with a threatening attitude towards him (defendant), who took it away from him. Defendant considered himself in danger, and on that account took it away. He had a right to protect himself. 'lhe compiinant denied having tapped his bayonet Mfr. BROUGtTOr said that was likely to be the eas'e and that it was unjustifiable on the part of defendant to take the bayonet. Mr. Brooks said that he was in the bar-parlour, when he heard a disturbance in front of the bar. He heard com- Slainant say, "1'11 be-iff1 gowhile you have two bedsa" Iefendantasaid, "I will puit you out if you do not go." Complainant observed, "1 can use this,0 striking the bayonet with a stick. Tfhe lan,dlord then took it away. Mr. BROUcrrON.-Bot this was after h3 threatened to turn the sergeant out? Witness.-Yes; complainant made a blow at defendant with his fist, Witness then left the bar to assist the defendant. He was foBlowed by his man and the barman. They succeeded in turning him out. He did not see complainant's shako knocked off. He saw him and defendant on the fioor, and the former had hold of the hair of the latter. Defendant here observed that the law of the case was, that if a licensed victualler did not provide room for a bilet in his own house, he must furnish him with one elsewhere. Mr. ERoucaTow inquired if there was accommodation in the defendant's house ? Sergeant Miller replied that there was, and that it was a very large house, with two parlours. *Mr. BRouaGnTos observed, that if it was proved there was accommodation, the landlord was bound to give it. Defendant remarked that he had great objections to have soldiers billeted upon him, .and it was a subject of great an- noyance to publicans that they were so compelled. It was a great hardship upon licensed victuallers to be compelled to lodge themi, more than any other portion of the Queen's subjects. HIe (his worship) woulld net like to have' soldiers b illeted upon him. Mr. BstouassrOy,-I have no power; it is the law, which you are required to obey. The defendant saidthat some depOt or barracks might be established at virious railway termini, and that the burden of maintaining billets ought to be placed en all by means of a tax for that purpose, Mr. Christia, with whom the cem* planantwoud have lodgedl, wvould prove thab he had a order to receive himn (Tbe order was pi-oduced;})a Mr. BuotonroyN observed that he must give his judgment according to the weight of the- evience,! and he thought that that of the complainant and his witneses, who were ordered out of court, ws most clear. The defendant was fined 60s., or in default of pyment two months' imprisonment. The defendant paid the fine, and consented to give the complainant his bayonet. .WEsTMSmrzPL-Patick Collins and Andrew Snelling were charged with being concerned with a number of others not in custody in violently gsaulting Mr. John Jones the proprietor of the Grosvenor Arm± Xlower Belgrave-place, and also with assaulting the police. Mr. AILncoD said, that the matter was of too sernous a description for him to deal with summarily, and he should therefore at a future period send it to the essions. The accused were remanded. WOBssP-sTmrr.-Alfred Swinburne, a respectable. looldng young man, was cearged before MIr. DIEu5COunT with being concerned with other mnen not in custody in the comlission of the following robberies - 35r. Ednund SoMi2eux, stockbroker, stated :-fy private residence is at Walthainstow, and on the 13th ult at It at night, when we retired to rest, the doors were ail properly secured, though I cannot say whether the window3 were. 2Bext morning, on getting up, Ifound that thehouse had been entered during the night by thieves, who must have effected an entrance through the dining-room window, which opens upon the garden. In that room I left a gold watchandtwomeerschaum ipes ; they were stolen. From the drawing-room 4Z. worth cf cIgars was stolen, and from the or hal a great coab an pair of boots. The gold watch, coat, and pipe produced are mine, and the pipo alone is worth 26 I am certain that two men at least must havo been engaged in the robbery, asnot onlyhud mydarklantern beenaused, but also a Palmer's candle-lamp, the light of |which was found blowFn out. Mr. Alton, a pawnbroker at Eackney.-I produce this gold watch, pledged with me by the prisoner on the day jfter the burglary for 1?. 'On the 4th inst. he wvanted to redeem this watch by pledging another gold one, but on refrg toa-tern to us I stopped it and gavebhim inecharge, and thewlFateh turned outto be the Property of Ladg huggeridge, wife of Sir [Henry Muggeridge, and formed part of the produce of a burglary at Sir HIenryss house on Streathaur-comr,non. I w9ish to call particular atTentiOn to the extremely defective state of this route-lst, as it is called; they are constantly incorrect, and in this case Sir HIenry's watch was described as a Geneva one, whereas it was of Engldish make, and even the malcer's name wa riven-wroly; so that itwas a chanceIdidright in stop. Jr. D'CO1XB.-Thepublic are much indebted toyou for it was entirely through your decisive and straightforwrd1 conduct that these robberies have been traced cut. GeorgeWebb, assistantto3Mr. Neave, apawnbroker atHaggerston-I produce a gold guard-chain (Lady Mnugeridge's) and meerschaum pipe, both pledged on the 8th inst., the former by a woman named Ann Southey. Thomas Jordan, another pawnbroker, proEduced a coat pledged for Ss., tho corresponding half of the duplicate being found on the prisoner, and Davis, a constable, proved finding on the prisoner two duplicates for other coats, both the property of Sir Henry Muggeridge. Charles Nash and Evdward Jones, two other pawnbrokers, produced two of Sir Henry's coats, pledged respectively for 2s.and 5s by theprisoner, Sir Henry's coachman identifying them, and deposing that one of the three coats, when new, cost n less than 81. Elizabeth Southey, wife of a musician at H;ackney, who was much distressed while giving her evidence, statedThe prisoner is my cousin, and one Saturday, but I forget which, he ask-ed me to pledge a meersehaum pipe forh and I did so, obtaining 3s. on it. I a.'so pledged a gold guardchain (Iady Muggeridge's) for him, and in both cases gave him the money. He has been lodging with us since Chnstmas. He has no parents. He is in a consumption. He used to work as an engineer at Deptford, but cannot do so now, from having twice broken a bloodvesseL He is an out-patient of the GeIman Hospital at Dalston, and spits a great quantity of blood continually. Mr. D'E=OURT.-I have repeatedly noticed that in nearly all cases pawnbrokers give the name of " Ann"' to all women and girls who pledge with them. This is verylikely to subvert thecads of justice, and Iwish the wouldwte on the duplicates the names given by the peopIe themsves but I repeat that it is nearly in every case "Ann" n ero is an instance. r. Weave's sbopman produces a ticket with "Ann Southey" on it, when it turus out to be Elizabetb, and the worst of it is that nearly al the pawnbrokers do thesame. Sr. Hurlstone7 the second clerkI-And I know that in many cases they give that name to men and women indiscriminately. Sergeant Jackson.-There have been numerous robberies and burglaries lately of a similar description to these, and I wish to state that the name and address the prisoner gave me were both false. The burglary at Sir Henry luggeridge's was effected by more than one thief. The prisoner declined offering any defence, and was committed for the completion of the depositions in each of the cases. CLERn.Em lTz.-Eizabeth Webster, aged 24, aniserablelooking woman, was placed at the bar before Mr. CosRiu, charged, on her own confession, with having caused the death of Samuel Webster, her child, U1 months old. William Damon, 175 G., having been sworn, said-This mnorning, at 7 o'clock, I was on duty in Portpool-lane, Gray's-inn-lane, when I found the prisoner lying down in the passage leadingtoahousefastasleep. I awoke her, when she said-` Lord bless me, I have done it." I asked her, "What have you done " She replied, "I have killed it." laskedher," "lVathaveyo killed?' She said, "I have killed my child." I inquired, "Where is it?" She repied, "It is at No, 7, Charles-street, Hatton-garden." She then said she had lived there. I took her to the stationhouse in Bagnigge-wells-road. She had been drinking, and was very confused and bewildered. Inspector Anderson, G division, said he had made inquiries, and found that she was not living in Charlesstreet, Hatton-garden; but he had ascertained that in May last she had taken her child, 'which vas then four months old, from St. Andrew's workhouse. MIr. Coxsm-Did she say how she killed the child? Damon.-She said she squeezed it by the throat. Inspector Anderson.-She has given several statements, your worship. She said that her husband's name was Moffaitt a compnsitor on the Morning Advderliser; then, that he was employed at a banking-establishment in Vellington-street, Strand; but on inquiry I find that none of her statements are true; she also said that she left the child in the street, and that it was dressed in a black frockl, patent shoes, speckled socks, and no cap. MIr. Co11BIE questioned the prisoner, but she stood at the bar in a state of apparent stupor, looldng steadfastly at one spot, and not answering any question. Inspector Anderson.-I think her present state proceeds from dedi,ium tremen>. Mr. CosRn:-I shaU remand her for a week, and during that time every care must be taken of her, and the publicity of the case may lead to discoveries. The prisoner was accordingly remanded.

Sir,-This subject has engade the attention of your journal in timepast, and, as a monopoly in one of the first neoessaries of life is of generat interest, perhaps the follw. ing facts showing afurther intended wrong by one of thom monopolies may not be unworthy your notice, 'Whena water company was frst estiblised to sn the BLshop of London's estate, known as " the PaddinI estate," the Ilishop and trustees of the estate made cerWit Conces6ions t6lhe company on condition that their tea should enjoy a certain advantage, by a somewhat cheaper I ate being paidfor the supply of wvter to them.

The company refusedto pay back:tois overlhamge, and' the magistrte issed hisa wat nt to distrain the goods of the seeretary of the company. The tenants and lessees on the estate have been driven to great cost and labour in obtainmg this point of decision. The company, seeing this decision, and that the tenants pere not lihkely longer to submit to be imposed on to' the extent they nad been, instead of redressing the wrong and injury they have exercised, have no w come to Parhament, ands asked it to pass a bill to "cxtinguish" the tenants' mghts. it is calculated that the opanyhavecharged 20,co to, more than the sum they ought legally to have levied bnder the provisions of their acts from the tenants of the Padding. ton estate. The bill proposes that, instead of the tenant's presiptive rght to be soupplied sith ater at " the rate of 1lper cent. below; the average rate taken by any company," the tenants shall be charged l1th per cent below the .naum s which subsequent laws have permitted any company tocharge, assuming-falsely, as is well knonthat dl te companies do alike charge the snmsinm, the truth being astisgset forthlin the evidenee before Parliament on this subject, that in the city of Londonthecha rge does not average so much as 2 per cent, on the annual value oE houses; and in Westminster, as far s it can be ascerne -the companies being in league and withholding all information-being less than 3 per cent. The company therefore desire now to susitute qie another thing for that wihich has been bought at a price for the tenants, and to which they asre rightly entitled.- Sorely a monopolizing company is not justified in seeking through Parliament a power to perpetuate a public wrong, that they may increase the rate of interest to be received on, their individual shares in their company.

I TO rHEEEDIXOR OF NHE THSM Sir,-From the tenour of those parts of the debate of the 14th inst. on the Civil Service Superannuation Bill 'which refenred to the artisans of the doc=ys it is evideut that a misconception prevails as to their not being subject to a diminution of their pay on account of theirbeing entitled tv the advantage of a pension. Having been for many yeas connected with the employment of men in engine-making ad shipbuilding, be£ore [entered the service of the Admiralty, my testimony as to the comparative remuneration. of such worlcinen m Goverunmentand in private service will, perhaps, be accepted, if you-will ndly spare room for it mn your valuable columns The worldng shipwxights and otber workmen on the establishbment of the dockyards receive pensions, the hghest rate being 241. per annum; they also receive half-pay under the amne of - hurt money," during such time as they may be unable to work on account of any injury they may receive in the execution of their duty; while those under private masters possess neither of these advantages. In consideration of these two advantages, and in order thatthe Government may meet the expenditure entailed by them, the artisans are paid at a low rate of wages; the shipwrights are paid (and I understate rather than overstate their case) Is per day less than shipwiights in private yards, taking the Average rate of wages throughout the -whole country; and this loss, or diminution, or dedrction, by whatever name it may be called, amounts to 15'. 12s. per annum. By our accounts it is shown that a few shil- inga per annum from each man would cover the *'burf money'-no rick money being paid by the Government; and from the tables of good insurance-offices it will be found that a man of about the age of 25 years can obtam 1001., payable to himself at the age of 60, or to his representatives if he dies before that age, for the sm. ef 21. 12s. per annum, or 6(d. per day off his wages. Recko tho value of money at 8 per cent., at the agr-em 60 to purchmse an annuity, 30D1. cash to him a that age wil be more than equal to the CGovernment pension of 201. or 241. He could therefore obtain for an annual payment of 71. 10s, instead of 151. }2s, as kept back from him by the Government, not only this mum for himsdf in his old age, but, in the event of his eirly death, it would be payable to his widow or children, or.any representative. Thi8 class of pensioners, therefore, pay for their own pensions, if these statements be correct - and I should not venture to ask a place for them in your columns if lbad notpaid much attention to the subject, on account of the largenumber of workmen under my charge, 'whom it baa beenniy desire to induce to provide for themselves ixt their old age upon these principles, the men of the steami factories being engaged at the market rate of 'wges, andrnot entitled to any pensions. It is trnetbat in the event of being disabled in the sernice before 60 the Government artisan has the ifurther advantage of a pension; but these casersare so few that they would not anect the money question; and in private mnannfactories, if a an loses a leg or anarima zitation as porter or something of that kind is geerally found for him. Constant and steady employment tends to induce good men to remain in Government employment, but for this they have to pay the other 6d. per day. As to the agument that the number of applications for situlations is a proof that cviVii servants are sufciently well paid, the plain answer is that the higher the pay t5e better menwi1lyon get and keep, and if any office is not suiffidiently well paid you will only get inferior and inefficient men, and plenty of tSese are alwvays to be bad for a-y place at any salary.

When the news reached Dublin the deepest sympathy 'was felt and expressed for the trag,ic end of a man who played so promiinent a part in the 3monetary as well as in the political world, and, as the Frcemal'sJounwcl correctly observes, all past hostilities seerned to be forgotten in the deplorable finale. With regard to the actual position of the bank nothing certain has transpired; but, according to ramour, there is every reason to apprehend something like a monetary panic-confined, however, to a particular district-as the consequence of the presernt derangement of the Tipperary Bank and its several branches in the south of Ireland. It is stated that a candidate for the representation ,-of the borough of Sligo has already come forward in the person of Mr. L. A. Treston, of the Connaught cilrculit, a gentleman whlose name is but little knowvn beyond the circle of his owvn profession. It is also stated that MlIr. MPDonagrh, Q.C., and ,lr. P. Blake, Q. aX, are in the field, the former having left DubliEn to canvatss the constituency. Mr. M'Donagh isa native of Sligo, and in polities aa advanced Conservative. THB F UNtDS. Threeper Cent.

LEOMIINSTER £LECTIOM. THE POLL. Yesterday morning the poll opened at o'Clock, and the friends of the Conservative and anti-ballot candidate having got theirnien early together flocked in a body to the poll, and at once placed tr. Hardy in a majority. There were, as far as we can learn, no public breakfasts, and the town was perfectiy quiet and orderly throughout the day. There is a story current here that at former elections, timder the old regime, it tvas customary for the candidate to invite the "f ree and independent" to broeakfast, on which occasion the coffee served was sweetened with sovereigns. If any golden inducement has been applied on the present occasion it nsist be in another fashion. At 9 o'clockthe poll stood thus- For Mr. Hardy (C.) ... ... 50 For M1r.

EHER IJESTn's VISIT TO WOOLwsCIr.-WOOL-vncs, Feb. 19.-On MIonday evening intelligence was forwarded to the authorities of Wooliich Arsenal, and to the Superintendent of Police, informing them that the Queen wvould inspect the invalids of the Royal Artillery, wvho have arrived at Woolwich from time to tine from thc Crimea, on the following morning. Accordingly, at 11 o'clock yesterday morning two Royal carriages, wNith servants in plain liveries, entered the Royal .Arsenal gates, escorted by Captain Wilson's troop of the 3d Light Drageon Guards. A guard of honour, composed of the Roval Artillery, vith the band and drmus, were in attendance in the Dial-square. The first carriage contained the Queen and Prince, attended by the Countess of Desart and the Hon. Miss Byng. Lord Rardinge, in his full uniform of commander-in-chief, and Lord Panmnurefollowedin the second carriage. As Her 31ajest's visit was specially intended to ba paid to the invalids and tthat portion of her brave troops w-ho have returned from the seat of war, in charge of a goodly number and variety of Russian trophies, the stay was not protracted beyond an hour. Her Majesty alighted in the area, vhich containsthelarge assemblage of guns, and th2 v,arious articles captured at Hango and Sebastopol, and which were described in Vllc Timrcs at the period of their being landed there. Major Lukin and the remnant of hsis companions not on furlough, who came home in charge of the trophies, wrere drawu up in the principlf aliey of the Dial-square. The Queen approachel the soldiers, and addressed a kindly question to each as to hsis health, &c., and thence passed onward to inspect onn ef the newly-constructed ambulance vwaggons and carts. which had been harnessed and drawn up for the porpose of displaying to the Queen and Prince the convenence and comforts wvhich the improved system of our ambulance nowv affords. The principle on vhich they are built combines the important advantages of rendering them available for the comparatively easy removal of eight wounded men in a single conveyance with the slightest possible delay and considerable coafort. Each comrptrtment was explained and laid- open, when Her Majesty and the Prince took the me.ost sensitive interest in witnessing the rapidity and readiness with which the beds were withdraw n, and laid on the ground for the purpose of receiving the woulided, the beds being .as easily and readily replaced. They then proceeded to the adjacent committee room, where anumber of invalids were as<sembled for the Royavisit. Some of these had lost an arm, a leg, or were otherwise disabled. To each and all Her Majesty spoke in such a sympathetic tone and manner as appeared fully to compensate thema for all their sufferings; some of the brave fellow-s were affected even to tears. The time intended to be devoted to the Queen's condolence 'with her disabled soIdiers having e%pired, Her Majesty was observed to remain for some time in consultation -with the Commander-in-Chief, and was then banded to her carriage by General Bouverie. The Queen left the Arsenal at 12 o'clock, and returned to London, escerted in the same manner by the Cd Liglit Dragoons. REST OY THE S-&BBum.-Last night a meeting, announced as that of the men of London opposed to the openings of mnsenmis and exhnslitons on Sundays,took place at Exeter-halL Not only was the large hail completely filled, but so many persons were endeavom-ing to obtain admission about the time when the proceedings were to coinmence, that it wras necessary to close the entrancv from the Strand. Persons wvere waiting at the doors two hours afterwards. A prayer having been offered up by Dr. Rule, the chair was talen by Mr. Joseph Tritton, of the firm of Barclay, Bevan, Tritton, and Co. The chairman brieidy enforced the object in view by contending that not one hour of God's blessed day ought to be polluted by pleasure. and that if the Sunday -were ever legal'ly made a day of pleasure, ledgers would be opened, business carried on, and i twould soon become a day of inevitable toil. We had been called anation of shopkeepers, but it would ab a mueh treater stigma upon England if she could be called a nation of Sabbath-breakers. He appealedto the meetinwvihetherthe Briti-h3fuseum, theNationalGallery,andthe CirvyalPalace oughttobeopenonSundays. The answer to this appeal AVas given by enthusiastic and prolonged cheers. 2ir. J. J. Cuinmins moved the first resolution, " That this meeting believin- the Sabbath-day to have been hallowsed by Almighty God at the Creatior, and kept holy afterwards by His express command, recognizes in the Lord's-d.ay a divinely ordained memorial of the Saviour's resurrection, arnd a day made for man to worship God, to rest his mind and body, and to refresh his soul with sacred things ; that this meeting is, therefore decidedly opposed to the opening of znyYexhibition of a secular eharacter upon the Lord's-day, and considers that if the Legislature or the Government were to sanction the same, it would be a national violation of the command of God, and would inflict a public wring by depriving many persons of a gieat Chritian privilege and right, for the amusement of others." 9r. Cummins, in support of the views embraced in the resolution, exhorted both rich and poor to resist tie proposed removal of the restrictions against opening the places in question on Sundays. As to the rich, nre wouldiseg of them to refrain from Saturday evening parties, Sunday drives, from visiting clubhouses on Sundays, and from everything and anything which tended to violate the snctity of the S.abbath. He hoped. that the rich would yreserve the Sabbath for the poor, that they might dedicate at to religion. 31r.. RBxter, who seconded the resoeution, said that the lawv prohibitmg labour on the seventh day was 3 been to the poor, and that Parliament ought not, by or,ening the institutions in question, to compel one man tolabour inordertoamuseanother. The resolution was agreed to, with reiterated cheers, and very faint marks of dissent. The next resolution was, v " That the neculiarities of English life and character, and the mental anid physical exhaustion pro. daced by the overwhelming demands of business, render Sunday rest specially necessary for the morals, the education, thic health, and the happiness of the people; that in the opinion of this meeting, 'the openingof thelBritish Museum, the National Gallery, the CrystalPalace, and other similar institutions,' on the Lord's-day, would lead to a large increase of labour, to a deterioration of the character of the nation, and endanger the preservation of a weekly rest." Mr. Corderoy, who moved this resolution, and Mr. Renderson, who secondel it, arguedin the same spirit as the preceding sPeakers. The formaer said that the opening of the LNational Gallery on Sundays would be an insult to the relgios feelins ofthe country, and asked if ever a man was made virtuous by loolcing at pictures. Such exhibitions as those referredl to could teach nothing to the man whose mind bz d not been prvionly prepared by education. The resolution, s well as a vote of thanks to tle chairman, was agreed to, byadisflay of feeling decidedly in opposition to the proposed motion of Sir Joshua Walui-ey.
THE INQUEST 0X IM SADLEIR, M.P. Yesterday morning, at half-past 11 o'clock-, Mr.waley, I the coroner for Middlesex, and a respectable jury, inha- i bitarts of Hampstead, opened an inq.uest on the body of Mr-. John Sadleir, hLP., who was found dead on Sunday rmorning last, on Hasnpstead-heatb, uinder circumstances f which could scarcely admit of doubt that the unfortunate gentleman had died by his own hand, as already related in this journaL. Mr. William T. Manning, coroner of the Queen's Household and the Verge, appeared on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, two of whom were present-namely, 3Ir. ! WiliDam Sadleir, his eldest brother, and MIr. Clement Sadleir, a younger brother. Several of the personal friends and acquamtances of the deceased wvere also in attendance; including, among others, Mr. Francis ScuDy, YLP., Mir. Vincent Scully, Mh.., Mr. Leonard Morronuh, of Dabli r3.TH. Doyle, andc Mr. orris. Mhedeceased gentleman was known in public life as the representative inParliamnent, first of the borough of Carlow, a4 lately of Shgao, ass Lord of the Treasury in the Governmnt of Lord Aberdeen, .and as the Chairman of the London and County Bank. He was in the 42d year of his age, unmarried, and had in early life practised 'as a solicitor in Duiblin. The jury proceeded to view the body, 'which lay in a shell in the deadhouse, and on their retnur Joseph Elwin was caUed, and deposed that he was the butler of the decea,sed, and resided in his master's house, 11, Glocester-souare, Hyde Fark-gardens. eH had seen the b9dy, and identified it as that of Mr. Sadler. He saw him last alive, aboult half-past I1 o'clock on Saturday evening lIt, in the dining-room of his own house. He did not kn.ow. wvhat time the deceased left thehouse, but itnmust have been between half-past 11 and a quarter to I o'clock. He had pfeviously to half-past U gone twice into the dining-room to taLe away the teathings, but his master -would not allow him to do so. At a quarter to 1 o'clock that night he went to fasten the front door, but he did not do so, finding that his master had gone out. On going into the dining-room, where his master had been during the evening, he found that one of the candles had been put out, and on returning int4 the hall he noticed the other extinguished and standing on the slab there. He also knew Mr. Sadleir had gone out, from his hat and a thick heavy greatcoat, the latter of which he seldom wore, having been taken away from the hall. The front door was shut, but he did not interfere with it, as he knewI his master was out and could let himself in with his latchkey. Joseph Bates, a labouring man, living at 7, Branston'scourt, Hampstead, deposed to finding the body of the deceased, about 20 minutes before 9 o'clock on nunday morning last, at the back of the Jack Straws Castle Tavern, beside a boe, about 200 yards from the high road. He was lying on Irs back, with his head bent backwards against a furze bush and his feet towards the edge of the bog. All his clothes were on except his hat, -which lay near to the body. He did not go nearer to the body at first tlan about 20 yards, until a policeman came, whom he had directed a man named ludge, -who vas passing, to go for. On approaching the deceased with the police-constable and Rudge they found nearhim a silver cream jng (produced) anda bottle marked "poison." [The bottle vas here produced and identifled. It had aglass stopper covered vwith leather, across-which the wvord " poison" was written in large letters three times. The bottle itself, which was so large as to hold nearly halfa-pint, was also labelled bwith the same word in different places, and was inscribed, " Essential oil of bitter almonds," and with the name of tie chymist who suappliedthe poison, "John Maitland, 10, Chester-place, Hyde Park-square."J He didnotfeel the sl;inof thebodyat all, to knowv whetheror not it was cold. He saw tIre pockets searched by the policeconstable. [Tie constable, as wiU be seen, afterwards describedtheir coitents. The body was put on a stretcher and taken to the workhouse. Mo medical gentleman was sentfor vhenthebodynwasfirstfound. Hesaw nosignsof violence or struggling abont the spot; nor vwere the deceased's clothes at all torn or disturbed. Police-constable Hewson, 323 S, deposed to accomparying the previous witness to see and remove tire body about a-quarter before 9 on Sunday morning. He saw nothing about tie spot to indicate a struggle, except a mark or two which the deceased appeared to have made with his heels. The body was quite cold. They found on the person of the deceased six sovereigns, two lhalf-sovereigns, a 5o. note, 12s. Gd. in silver, some copper, a white cambric pocket- I handkerchief, a small pecket paper knife, a latchkey, a pair of gloves, a case containing two razors, a piece of paper, on wvhich was written "Join Sadleir, 11, Glocester-square, Hyde Park."' rThe butler identified the writing on tire paper as that of Ihis master, and also the rest of the articles o5 taving belon ged to him.] The cream jug,which had a few drops of the poison still in it, was lying near him, as if it had dropped from his right hand. The bottle l.ay on his left side, with the stopper out, and about a foot distant froi it. The a-azorswerealsolyin"inthe caseonhis rightside, and thepiece of leather- with whicY the stopper- of tire bottle had been tied dowin wasin his waistcoat pocket. Mo medical man sawr the deceased before he ywas taken to the wvorkhouse; hut MIr. Nichol, surgeon, saw it there. He (witness) found no letter or document on the deceased, but tir piece of paper bearin" his namne and address. A few lumps of sugar were found loose in his coat pocket. Mr. R. Nichol, surgeon, practising at Hamstead, said, he saw the body of the deccased at 20 minutes to 10 o'clock, on Sunday morning last, in the deadhouse of the workhouse. It was then quite cold and the limbs were rigid. There was a most powerful odour of the essential oil of bitter almonds perceptible at the mouth. Tire eyes wore glistening and quite life-like in expression. There wvas no froth at tAe mouth. But for the smreil of the oil of almonds there was nothing to show that the unforturate gentlemat had died of poison. The eyes retained their life-like expression for several hours. He made the post D20rltes examination of the body on MIonday evening, when it had undergone little or no change. It bore no mark of external violence anyw here. There was some post ioite,i corgstion of the lungs, posteriorly, and of the bronel tuibes. There was no valvular disease of the heart, but a thickening was perceptible in the left ventricle. The right auricle of the heart w"as distended with blood, and the left ventricle was empty. The only cavity that contained blood was the right auricle. There was an odour of tie essential oil of almonds all over the body. The stomach contained about 10 ounces of matter, consisting mostly of undigested food. From six ouinces of that matter he took an ounce and a-half of essential oil of bitter almionds by distillation, and half an ounce simply by ffitration. Embedded in the coats of the stomach, and lying on it, were numerous black particles, perceptible to the naked eye. On exammning these 'with the microscope he believed them to be pow.dered opium. Those particles were stuck all over the mucous membrane, chiefly on the upper curvature, and were so numerous as not to bc counted. The mucous membrane of tire duodenum was friable like that of the stomach, though not so much so, and ts contenits showed the oil very evidently. The liver was healthy, but had a patch of discolouration on it. The gall bladder was empty, and there was slight congestion here arid there throughout the smaller intestines. The kidneys were congested, but otherwise healthy. The pupils of the eyes were dilated. Tire brain and membra>nes wvere cong7ested, but 'were otherwise healthy, and exliibitedno signs of inflanmation whatever. There was an effusion of serum at the base, slightly tinged with blood, to the extent of from four to six drachms-a large quantity certainly-which might have been throuvn out hi the act of death. There could be no doubt that the effect of the essential oil of almonds wvas the cause of death. EuInD the butler, wans recalled. and identified the cream jug as that which his master used at tea on Saturday evening. He added, in reply to the Coroner, that Mfr. Sadiler -as quite alone when he left him at tea. He had not seen the'¼ottle before which had been produced to-dav. hc took a bottle from the maidservant between 9 and 10 o'clock on Saturday evening, wiich wNas w"rapped up in paper. About five minutes before 7 o'clock on Saturday evening, -when he was laying the cloth for dinner, his master gave him a piece of paper, m his own handwriting, to take to Mr. Maitland, the chvinst. (This papar, wvhich was produced, was written in a told flovwing hand, and wmas exactly as follows -" Get from M aitland's a bottle of the essential oil of bitter almonds; I don't know the quantity v-anted, but-but Kenyon writes to me to bring 11. wortli. Psymy bill at 3MaitJand's." [Een-on u-as stated, by a gentleman present, to be the eceased.'s groos, and to have Icase of his std of humtitig horses at Leighton Buzzard.] He went to haitland's, but the assistant couid not give it him at tbat time. He asked the assistant w-hat quantity of the article a sovereign would purchase, and he replied,abouthalf a pint. Mr. Sadleirhad previously that evening asked lim to clean two bottles and place them on the sideboard, wlich he did. He (witness) dinot know it was poison that he had to get at hlr. M3aitland's. He thoureht it was sonie ingredient in a hair-wash which his master was going to mix an the two bottles, which had been placed on the sideboard. After 9 o'clock Mr. Sadleir rang the bell and asked himn if anything had come from 3Mr. Mraitland's. Witness said there had not. Mr. Sadleir said, he supposed 3Mr. Maitland had not the article by hmn, and had to send out for it. Witness said, he had, for it had baen sent for at 7 o'clock. Mr. Sadleir wished him to go for it, but witness got the kitcheriuiaid to go, as he had to attend to the tes, askin" her- at the same time to post a letter which 3Mr. Sadleirtd written to M Sadleir, in Ireland, his sister-in-lavw. She retumed from Mr. Maitland's in about half-an-hour with a bottle wrapped up in paper, accompanied by a note, both which he took upstairs and Laid by Mir. Sadleir's side on the table. Mlr. Sadleir was then sitting with his back to him and ap parently reading, and did not speak to witness. He had lived with the deceased upwards of 18 months. The deceased wasa temperate and sober man. HIe only drank a glass or two of sherry with his dinnuen. He had not of late noticed any change in thc deceased's manner. The deceased was much coceuied in business. He had not compLained of his head at al, or of not being able to nlean, nor was he under medical treatment. He came home unei. pectedlytodinneronSaturdayevening. He seldom dined at home, but usually at his club. He left home in a cab on Saturdaymorning,,withaquantityofpapers with him, as he was accustomed to do. Before getting into the cab he retured to his room upstairs, as if ho had forgotten something. Again, before he had left in the cab many minutes, be returned, and went upstairs for-a fewxnoments. He left in the cab again, and did not return until the evening. Hehal never before made any attempt on his life, to witness's knowledge. He always spoke civilly to witness, esecially of late, when witness had got used to his ways. Hannah Bishop, a woman of middle age, said, t r acted as kitehenmaid to the deceased. Il went to the shop of ir. Maitland the chymist, at the request of-the preceding vitness, for a pared on Saturday night List, between 9 and 10 o'clock. I saw 3fr. Maitland's assistant, who isked me ifIwas g,oingtogive it to r. Sadleirhimself? I said I should give it to the butler. He asked me again whether I was gonig to give it to Mr. Sadleir. I-said I never saw the gentleman (meaning MWr. Sadleir), but Iwvouid give it to the butler. The asitant cautioned me particularly about ifs being poison, and asked me not to let it Lie about at all on any account, but to take it rip to hlr. Sadleir immediately. I gave it to the butler, and did not hear anything more about it. WEhen I wient to Mr. 3laitland's I took a letter' to the post, whichl was givenime by the butler. Itcwas addressed "MSrs, Sadleir, Clonocedy, Clonme]," I believe shre wfas the deceasedt's sister--in.lawv. I have lived three years in his service, but I verv seldom saw him. I had sometimes. fetehed pils from Mr. 31aitland's forM3r. Sadleir, but notlaudanumn or opram. A gentleman present said, thc letter to Mrs. Sadleir, being posted after post houm onillaturday night, would not reach its destination until yesterday (Tuesday) mornig. TheCororerthenasked Mr. Manning if he hadany evidence to offer? Mr. Manning said, he had not, nor did he wish to interpose in any way as to the evidence which the coroner minht thiuk necessary to establish the cause of death. The Coroner said, nothing could be clearer than the cause of death. Any inquiry after that was much to be regretted, sceing that it might extend to matters which might distress the feelings of relatives. He thought the law in that re- spect was most unsatisfactory. The letter written by,tho' deceased to his sister-in-law appeared to be a document that ought to be produced, in the opinion of fpmeof the jury near him. He (the coroner) had no desire' to seb it. It was nerfectl clear to him' that the infortunate gentleman had died by his own act. 'Nothing could by any possibility be plainer. It was mtich to he deploredthat facility wasaforded to him to obtain the oeson in the w ay he had done; but, judging from his carryuga couple of razors inhis pociet, it was clear that if he had failed in destroying himself by taking or procuring the essential oil of almonds, he would have done it with a'razor. The only question forthconsideratfon of the jury was as to what was the stat of hismind at the time he committed the act. A juryman said, it was with that view only that the jury wished to see the letter produced. Mr. 3Manning said, Mr. Norris, a legal gentleman, was present, who was with Mr. Sadleir till a late hour on Saturcay night, and probably the coroner would wish to have him caled. The coroner said, it was very desimble that that gentleman should give evidence, if he had any to tender. 3Mr. Anthony Norris was then called, an;d, in reply to question nut by the Coroner, aaid,-I am a solicitor, prac: tising at lhTo. 2, Bedford-row, and was intimately acquainted w;ith the deceased. I saw him last alive, shortly -before 11 o'clock on Saturday night last, at his house. There was no one else with us. I bad no appointment with him, but Iwent up there to see him, and was with him about half an hour. I had known him since 1843, and had frequently transacted business with him. He was enged in several public concerns. He was chairnnan of the London and County Bank and of the Royal Swedish Ilailway Company. I believe he was also connected with several other companies, including an Irish bank, of wltich he was a director. He appeared oppressed by his undertakings. Latterly he seemed rather haggard. During the last week particularly I had noticed a great change in his appearance. lIe did not complain of his head, but I have noticed him put his hand to his head as if he was oppressed. He appeared to be quite borne down by the extent of his business, and particularly by soine occurrences which tcok place with reference to his alFairs last week. They were losses and pecunia<r embarrassments ~vhich had lately come upon him, and it was about these that he talked to mce duringour interview on Saturday night. During the interview I noticed a peculiarity in nhs manner. His eyes were bloodshot. He wvas very restless, and evidently not in Ihis usual temprament ashen I saw him. I had not seen him in such a state before, at least not to anything like the same extent. Ee was alwiays cool and collected until within the last few days. From Wednesd.ay lst, inclusively, I had seen him every day, and I think I saw him on Tuesday also. I was not his solicitor. I believe he had variouS solicitors, and I have understood that Mr. Gurney of No.2, Nicholaslane, was one of tbem. 3Wr. Gurney and his partners I know transacted business vith him on Saturday. His life was insured some years ago. He told me on Thursday or Friday last that it was insured. I know it wavs insured, for I once paid a premium upon the policy. [Mlr.. Man. ning.-It was insured in one office for 5,0001.] He told me he had life policies, but he did not say to what amount on tho whole. When I left Mr. Sadlcir about half-past 3 on Saturday afternoon he made an appointment with -me for the next (Sunday) morning, at ll o'clock. He said he would rather I would not call on him that (Saturday) evening, because he wanted to collect hispapers and to be alone. In consconence, howvever, of receiving a letter from Ireland after leaving him on Saturday afternoon, which concerned him, I went and saw him again that evening. He seemed surprised when I went in, and was walking about the room, which was very unusual vwith him. I thought I perecived a very great redness and peculiarity about the eyes, as if he had been weeping. I called next morning ts keep my appointment with him at 11 o'eclock-, and then I learnt for the first time that lie was dead. The coinmunication I made to him on Saturday night was not of a distressinw character. It bad reference to the events that had pressed upon him during the week, and that was the cause of my going to see him. I f&snd, on going to his house on Sunday morning, that he had left a letter for me in the ball, whEich MIr. Niehol, wsho had gone there before me, had taken to my private residence after I left home. It was w.ritten by Mlr. Sadleir, and dated Saturday night. The Coroner.-Have you brougut that letter w.ith you? Witness.-I have not. The Coroner.-Why did you not bring it? Witness.-I forgot it. The Coroner appeared to think the omission remarkable underthe circumstances, and asked if -witness had really forgotten the letter, or whether le had any rcluctance to produce it ? Vitness said, he had been much affected ever since the death of Mr. Sadleir, and had realy forgotten to bring the letter. I{e did not IOW whether it was w ritten a fter he left the deceased on Saturday night. He foind it on retuning to his p.ivate residence, about half-past 11 on Sunday morning. By 31r.M aning.-In the course of Saturday afternoon I made a remark in Mr. Gurney's office in reference to Mr. Sadleir's appearance, and to some reverses that had come suddenly upon him. The remark was that I shoul<1 not be srprised if Mr. Sadleir were to shoot himself. I said that to a MEr. Stevens about 2 o'clock on Saturday afternloon. I -was acting professionally for MEr. Sadleir in one matter at tle time of his death. The reason I made that remark was, that Mr. Sadleir was a man of extraordinary clearness and strength of mind, and my impression w.as that these reverses, coming suddenly upon him, as they did on Wednesday orning last, his mind wvould break down at once. I vws told last weeak that his losses were very severe. The subject was discussed in my office, and he admitted it. Mr. Manning said, he had to contend that the letter wvritten by the deceased to Mr. Norris would be a confidential communication betveen solicitor and client. The Coroner intimated that he would consider the point. The butler was recalled, and stated that on Sunday mornirg, when he saw his master had not come home, he fonnd three letters on the slab in the hall, all addressed to Mr. Robert KCeating, M.P. for Waterford, at Shamrock-lodge, C'apham, accompanied by a paper in Mr. Sadleir's handv.riting, to the effect that if he was not at homne by 9 o'clock on Sunday morning he (witness) was to deliver them. At 9 oloek on Sunday morning, his miaster not having come home he sent a messenger with the letters to tMr. keating atClaphsami. Thare was also a letter addressed to Mr. Norris left on the slab in the hall. JosephlVestrupdeposedthat hewas.anassistant to Mr. iMaitland, chymist, 10, Chester-place, HydePark-square. He had heard the evidence of the butler and k-itc'enmaid, which was in all respects correct. He wvished to add that he wrote a note to Mr. Sadleir, and sent it with the kitchenmaild when she took away the bottle containing the oil of bitter almonds. As the original letter did not appear to be forthcoming, he wished to read a copy of it which he had kept. It Nvas as follows:- " As the poisonous qualities of the essential oil of almonds are very great, Mr. Maitland would be obliged to Mr. Sadleir not to allow it to pass into the hanids of inexperienced persons, who may perchance be iunaware of the danger in using it, or allow it to lie about unprotected. " 10, Chester-place, Feb. 16, 185l(. The Coroner said, it was a pity that such articles shou'd be sold, even by medical men. Mr. Maitlandremarked that the essential oil of bitter almonds was sold by every confectioner in the kingdom. The Coroner.-A pleasant reflection for those who eat confeetionary. (A laUghL) Some custards that I have seen I know have contained the essential oil of bitter almonds in poisonous quantities. Witness continued to say he had been in the habit of snpplyiDg Mr. S2dleir with medicine occasionally, but not before %vsth the essential oil of bitter almonds, and that he should not liave furnished it on Saturday night last had he not received an application for it in that gentleman's own handwriting. The Coroner then ordered the room to be cleared, and on the readmission of the public, after an interval of a few minutes, he said thec jury had unanimously expressed a wish that the inquiry should be adjourned, in order to afford time fortheproduction ofthe letters written by the deceased on the night preceding his death, and any further evidence that could he adducead to show the state of his mind at that time. They wished him to say, at the saile time, that, in maidg that requ.est, they had no wish to go unnecessarily into the private or family afiairs of the unfortunate gentlemn,an or to cause any pain to his surviving relatives.- r. Mlaiming said, the letters written to Mr. -Keating would be in the nature of family affairs, as that gentleman was a relative of 3Ir. Sadleir. The Coroner admitted that the production of the letters rnightbeattendedawithsome difficulty, but the jurywere only anxious tohave some evidence which might throwlight onthestateofthedeceased'snmind atatime shortly before bis death, and when the letters in question were produced they would form their opinion as to vwhether it was desirable that theyshouldbc put m and appear onhis notes. Mr. Maanin said; ho was quits ulnawvare of the confents of the letters in question, and he supposed when they were produced the coroner would peruse them in tie first instance, and then confer with the jury as to the desirability, or otherwise, of readin , them in open court. The Coroner said 1iUat those letters were written at a late hour on Saturday niht, and itwas essential thatthey should be produced to show, if possible, the state- of mind of the decensedat that time. At the same time, ihe tho6mght inquiries into family and private affairs in cases of this kind were highiy simisehievou, and he trusted the day was5 not far distant when the law wrould te altered in that respect. At the reqnsest of Mr. Manning, Mr. Wakley gave an order for the interment of the body of the deceased andthe inquest was adjourned until Monday next, at 11 o'ciock

THE LOCAL. DUES ONT SHIPPING BILL. COtURT OF COMMON CONCII. D - Yesterday a special'Court was held for the purfose of re I ceiving and acting upon the report of the Consolidated Committee on the Local Dues on Shipping Bill, inmParliament. Although the notice was extremely short, there was a lire attendance of members, and the benches of the' aldermei indicated that the subject was considered to be one of great importance to the corporation. Mr. WOonno:urP, the clerk of the court, read the following report, which was received with cheers " We, whose namnes are hereunto subscribed, of your Coinsolidated Committee, to whom, on tle 14th inst1. it was' referred to consider a bill for the abolition of passing tolls and the regulation of local dues on shipping, and report. thereon, do certify that Mr. Remembrancer having laid the said bill before ns, we proceeded to consider the same, and find that iti proposes. to deprive municipal corporations and other incorporated bodies of the revenue which they derivo from dues on shippiog and on goods carried in ships; without any compensation or equivalent, notwithstanding the tight to create such dues and custoins was an undoubted part of the prerogative of the Crown, and that they were purchased by or granted to the present possessors with every security that can give validity to a purchase or grant, and that they have been repeatedly declared to he the property of the bodies which have so long possessed them by the highest courts or; judicature in the kingdom; that it also proposes to apportion existing mortgages and charges on such tols, dues, or customs upon dues on shipping, or goods carried in ships, and the other property of such corporations, with power as to the latter portion, if need be, to enforce the levying of rates upon the inhabitants for payment; that'it is also proposed by the said bill to deprivo many municipal corporations and other local bodies of the right to receive the tolls or dues on ships or goods carried in ships wvhich they at present collect under the authority, of numerous acts of Parlianient, and to transfer the management and control of the dues on shipping and goods carried in ships from the local authorities in many of the principal ;orts of the united kingdom to the Board of Trade. The bil also proposes to authorize Her Majesty in Council to abolish all or any of such tolls or dues. That your cosmsniittee consider that such tolls, does, or customs, held by municipal coiporations on the faith of Royal charters and grants of ancient date, and enjoyed by a long succession iof their ancestors witthout any dispute or denial, are property to which they are legally entitled, and that up to the present time all lands or possessions compulsori-y taken on the grounds of public good have been fully compensated for and ample security afforded that the compensation should be just and equitable. That your comsnittee feel it to be their bounden duty to recomniend your lion. Court to protest in the strongest maniner agjainst sutch. an innovation, and to empowver your commuittee to oppose the said bill, in order to prevent the recognitioni of aprinciple fraught wvith dalnger to all property. "That your committee have directed Mr. IRemembrancer to prepare the draught of a petition to the lion. the Rouse of Commons against the said bill, which your committee hdand recosmeud the petition to your hon.

Mr. WOOD (chairman of the comnmittee), in moving that lhe report be agreed to, said there was never an occasion on v hich it was nore necessary to call the members together for ite purpose of opposingan injurious principle. (Loud cries of "Hear, hear.") It was not because the corporation of LonCon was not touched by the obnoxious bill that they ought not to feel they were caled upon to act for their bret hren in Dover and Liverpool and other, towns wlhich would he :fected by its operation. The committee looked at the lillcalmly and dispassionately, and they found that the ron-compensating principle was its prominent fiature, and then came to tho unanimous conclusion that it shouild receive the most vigorous opposition. (Hear.) Deputy Lon felt great pleasure in seconding the motion. If ever a time occurred in wlhich the energies of the citizens cf London ought to be displayed in defence of their rights .nd privileges, the present suzpplied the occasion, and if they did not resolutely stand forward and immediately act in pposition to the hill, their doom was scaled, for it went oirectly to tle confiscation of private property, 'without granting compensation for the injury ; and the next step the Government would take would be the confiscation of the property of the corporation of London. (Rear, hear.) Then would follow the confiscation of t'ne property of 'the various companies, and last of all, as an inevitable conse(quence, the confiscation of thc property of individuals. (Cheers.) gaiisst such a calamity hcealled uponithe co1p0i ation to contend, for the protection of their fellowv-citizens. and he hoped to find every hand held up in favour of the struggle. 3r. V_ssLAxxCS said if it were the object of this bill to relieve the shipping interests of the country from oppressive chargeshe would be the Sirst to give it his support, provided itsouglhtto accomplish its purpose by jest and legitimate means; but in its present form the bill was one of spohia-. tion; it sought to confiscate the revenues of corporations, which were as sacred in the eye of the law as the estates of private individuals. (Hear.) The nioverof thebill hsadactually referred to the town dues of Lierpool as tuhe piroper subjects of confiscation, whereas no man possesRsed oXf property could produce a fairer legal title than the corpor.ation of I iverpool could show for these tolls. The contract deeds, theC foundation of their titie to the very tolls and dutes wvhich this bitll proposed to confiscate, corsitituted a poftion of the property transferred to the corporation of Londoni by what was terned the Royal contract by Charles II., to secure the repayment of 230,000O. wlich the citizenis had Ient to Kiiig James, and 130,0001., a further snm, lent to King Charles upon the execution of the mortgage, by which lands, manors, lordshlips, fairs, market-tolls, and port dues, part of the hereditary revenues of the Crown, had becn assigned over, with powers of sale to repay these advances. The Liverpool town dues at the date of the contract 'were on lease to Sir Richard Idolynceux at a rent of 141., and were purchased from the corporation of London in 1083 by M.%L Fazakerly, and subsequiently sold by hin to the town of LiverpooL The conisideration paid by Mr. Fazakerlyforthopurehasewas450?., whiclh, althoughatrifling sum, if measured by the present revenues of the port, was a very lalre amount at a time when the rent paid was on!y 141., and Liverpool was a place of no consioleintion. Some of the first families in this kingdomn held properties conveyed by this very contract-deed, n-id had no othir title but that which thle corporation of Liverpool possessed. The advocates for this bilL wllho would seize the property of corporations upon the pretext that it might have been obtained from imnprovident monarchs, did not so apply this rule when dealing vwith grants to individuals obtatined by means which might have been liable to some exception. When the Duke of Grafton, the grantee of one of Chiarles IL's patenits to tax all winies imported into the kingdom under the nanie of " prisage" and " butlerage," -was required for the benefit of comnierce, to surrender his patent, the Legislature secured to the heirs male of the first duke an annuity in perpetuity of 7,0001. a-year, charged upon the Consolidated Fniid, being the annual average revenue of his patent rights. (Cheers.) :Feeling that this bill was the first measure ever introduced into the British Parliament in which the confiscation of property had been openy avonred, lie trusted tho Court would unite wvith other bodies engaged in the opposition. (Cheers.)' ,,r. T. HL HALL would ask the niembers of the Court to suppos-t the motion. He was quite sure that the .ay in which the report was drawn up was unexceptionable. That corporation possessed property to a considerable amnount; but that property they hield solely for the benefit of their fellow-citizens. {Hear.) He held it to be right for them to interfere in a question like the one before them. It was not their desire, in doing so, to stop shipping, but as matters altered and changed to improve the system of adusinistration, and such a course he considered to be necessary. (Hear, hear.) He would not sign any petition which merely sought for party rights, but he vould sign one which ismed, as the proposition before them did, at the publie good. (Rear, hear.) Hie considered that the Local Duties on Shipping Bill enaeted a monstrous evil, as it proposed the taking away of rights long purchased, and ddnot propose to grant the sialest amount of compensation. tHear.) He wished it to he distinctly understood that the question of reform of the corporwation and the bill before them were separate, oand any opposition they might make to that bill was not intended in the slightest degree to rnterfere with the progress of reform. Deputy DAr - observed that, though ho did not agree with the whole of the bill, stil he considered it to be a large .and - excellent measure; an,d therefore he thoueht that, while that corporation opposed wrongdoing, they would consider the case honestly and fairly. (Hear.) He considered the exemption of certain bodies from the operation of the bill was based upon a sound principle,-namnely, that in cases in which essetttial services were proved to be rendered to the putblic the dues w ere not to' be interfered with. (HIear.) Thle bill, in fact, proposed interference only in cases where large duties and services -were rendered,- but where no such services were required he thoutght such a systemn ought to cease. 1Mr. RowVE approved the bilL Hoe tlought it was right for the Govemment to interfere in the matter, inasmuch as it was the fact that, though the dues last year at Liverpool' amounted to 1,095,0001., but a comparatively small sum W3VS spent in the improvement of the shipping and the navigation generally, while the remainder, several thousand pounds, went into the borough funds. (Hear.) The most exorbitant suras were paid for lightening vessels of their cargoes. It was his deliberate opinion. that one of the chief reasons why the Government had interfered 'was because the corporation of Liverpool had insisted upon fees, and therefore h'c hoped that tris corporation of the city of London would mind its own business, and not intermeddlc in the matter. ("' Hear," and laughter.) Sir HL IUG&EEThGE said that he went with the report to a considerable extent, but he was quite confident that it was exacedinglyimportantto them as 'to the way in which theyintendedto word thepetition. (Hear.) In thesedays (f progression they must progress also, and he doubted whether it was wise for them to oppose the bill. London was one of the cheapest ports in the world; the tonnage dues were so li'ht; the navigation was in a most excellent state, - andtheytad asurplusof abount0,000. "What'wastobc done with the sunsm For such cases the bill provided, not interfering where the funds were required for extra services. He thought they should be careful, therefore, verygcareful, as to the manner mn which they worded the petition. ifear. Mr. Cox remarked that they might depend upon it; if the bill paEsed, the Goverrnment would soon show that they considered it fair game to take any property belonging to the corporation. Mr. J. WoOD having brieSj replied, The motion was unanmmo y carried, and a petition prepared for presentation to the House of Commons agaanst the bilL NEWCASTLE:-TPON-TYNE. LMr. Philipson, the. Mayor of NeXeastle-upon-Tyne, in his recent speech at the local meeting in that borongh, entered into a searching analysis of the arguments advanced by Mr. Lowe in support of his bilL Mr. ?hilipson argued that the dues which the commzissioners were now seeking to abrogate were legally payable and due, anl that there was no ground for interering with them.. -Mr. Philipson referred to various points in support of his arguinent, and concluded by saying:"Wearetoldby Mr. Lowe that itis a wrong that these dues should he leviedj and be paid, as this is, to repair your streets and so forth. -I d6n't admit that this is a correct statenment of the case; but, if Mr. Lowe will inquire into what is proceeding at this moment in London; and take up TIe 2Tizes of :aturday, he will find that they are now taking from the coal due the surm of 80,OOOt. for the purpose of forming a street in Southwark. I think, therefere, he might just as 'well direct his attention to that before he goes much further in this matter." Mr. Philipson then moved " that a petition be presented to the House of Commnons against the bill no* before the House, for regulating, as it is termed, the local does on ships, and on goods carried in ships." Mr. I. Plummer seconded the motion, and Mr. W.Turner opposed it, but on a division it was carried with on,ly one dissentient.vote--that of Mr. Turner himself.

A SCEmn ne Coxonoss.-After several niinutes' delay, the clerk called to order. Mr. Benson, of Mlaryland, rose to announce the result of tlle election for speaker, as one of the tellers. It was now nearly 7 o'clock, and the great chandelier cast its glare over the intensely excited concourse. " Licked, by thunder P" hissed one of the chivalry through his set teeth. "Got 'em, boys," said Matte3on, as he cavorted around in "sleepy hollow," and rolled his eyes from Father Giddings to one and another of the "old guard," who had fought battles, but never won such avictory before. And the densely crowded galleries looked dowse upon the scene in an agony of suspense ani hope and fear. "Order, order!1" shonted the clerk, and silence like death ensu;ed. X!r. Benson announced that Mr. Banks had received 103 votes, Mr. Aiken 100, and that Nathaniel P. Banks, jun., of Massachusetts, wras du7y elected Speaker for the 34th congress. And thtn there railed out upon the oppressive stillness a long, load shout of joy from a thousand willing throats; the ladies, nssmng in a body, clapped tbeir bands, and wildly waved their handkerchiefs; *in the lobbies members threw up their overcoats and beavers, and for a few minutes the scene in the galleries and on one side of the house was one of most tumultuous joy; and then the friends of MIr. Banks embraced emach other, and Northein men shook hands half-a-dozen timnes over with the men by whosesidetheyhad been fighting all day, just asthoush they had leng been separated. Massachusetts men, in particular, were in danger of being suffocated, and I was somewhat alarmed lest friend Burlingamne, -" the sleepless," should be crushed with kindness. You know already of the humiliating scene which folloved-how a few attempted even now to pluck from us the fruits of the loug contest; and how lr. Aiken, with the nobility of a true gentle. man, cast withering censure upon the factious opposition to the Speak-er taking his seat, by rising in his place and ask the privilee of now conducting Mr. Bank", as Speaker to thse chair. The applause wvhich hailed this act of magnanimity was only equalled by that whrich succeeded the aunouncement of the result; .aud more than one s'trong man, who had never faltered when the fi"ht was fiercest, now sank in his seat, overpowered by generous emotion. The last .act of this sublime spectaclev.was now about to close. A formal vQto of the House, from which 40 only excepted declared Mr. Banks to be the Speaker; and the Clerk appointed Messrs.

It has been usual for the Speaker elect to stanld on the lowver step of the desk and there take the oath. I have seen the thing dlone sereral times before, but no one 10 feet from the parties could hear anything of it, and but few could even ace it. ir. Banks walked directly up the steps to the Speaker's desk, and, as his hand touched the chair, the Sergeant-at-Arms elevated the mnace, -which insignia is never in its place except when the Speaker is presiding. Simultaneously the clerlk handed him the gavel, and then another tremendous shout burst from the audience, and was succeded by an impressive silence, while the Speaker gave utterance to his brief and atppropriate speech. You will notice that he avoided the usual pledge to save the UInion, and based his futuro course upon the simple institutions of oiur forefathers. We shall see whether or no the North can take care cf the Union. At the close of this address, Mr. Banks raised his right hand in position for affirmation, and FFather Giddings, standing in the centre of the area frontingtlle desk, in a loud, firm tone admlinistered the oath, thus -" Yon do solemnly swear that you vnll support the constitution of the Jnited States, so help you God !"

Edwards, working jewveler and watchmaker, in Flgh-street. It appears that about half-past 10 o'clock Mr. Edwards,who sleeps upon thepremiscs, left the shop and went out, and upon returning, shortly before 12, discovered that nearly the whole of his goods, which comprised all that was valuable in the shop, had been taken a-way. He immediately gave information to the police, and Mr. Enright, the superintendent, together with several of the force, have since been actively engaged in endeavouring to discover a clue to the burglars. There is no doubt the shop, which stands at the corner of a narrow passage, was entered by a side door, which, from the very insecure fastening (the lock being only held by a slig,ht staple on the outside) provided an easy access to the place. The hooks and cards to which the watches were alttached for exhibition in the window were but sli'htly disturbed, and, from the quality of the goods left beSind, there is little doubt that the burglars were good judges of tho property they were taking. The articles at present ascertained to have been stolen are 2S geld watches, 90 silver wvatches, 40 gold chains, iS gold wedding rings, 2 dozen of gentlemen's rings, and 2 dozen and a. half of dress rings and keepers. A reward of 501. has been offered for the apprehension of the burglars and the recovery of the property. The value of the goods stolen is stated to be about 3001.

He was i the saloon of the vessel at the time of the collision witl: the angerton. He ruished on deck, and returned again to the sloon for his gr.at coat and bit. He got into a boat, which was stove, and the captain ordered him and the other passengers out again. He rae, mained on deck 10 minutes after the boat was stove and tho vessel turned over on her beam ends. He held on to th% ladder (rigging), aul got on the upper side of the ship. Ho remained in the rigging a considerable time, but could see no boat until a Deal lugger came and took him off the wreci;c He first saw the Mangerton steamer drift away with the tide after she struck theJosephine Willis, and she continued increasing her distance. He Saw the steame&s lights a mile and a half off. He was in the inizentop of the Josephine Willi3 an hour and a half after she 'went down; The ship was strnckby the Margerton about a quarter past 8 oclock. When she went down there were 40 or 50 per4 sons clinging to her. There were four others in the mizen. mnast with him, and two in the topmast. They were all saveL.

There wasplenty of time to hava sentthe boat back again from the MIangerton andsave more lives before the ship went down. After the first boat left with passengers she had talken off three-quarters of arg hour elapsed before the ship went down. William Coshney, a Deal boatn, said he and anothct mtan were in a Deal lugger in the Channel at the time ci the collision. TL ey saw rockets fired from the Mangertosz after the collision, and went off to her, and put the master of the lugger on board. The captain of the Mangerton said a ship was sinking outside of him to the south-soutli-east. and that his own ship was in a bad, disabled state. The lifeboat of the Mngerton cametowards them, andit appraredta he in a lively state, but it did not accompany the Ilng.ertotho wreck.

A gentleman in front of the table replied that Captain Bomchier had not received any such certificate, or qualilieu himself to act as pilot of the ship he commanded. Captain IionERvson0.-By law he is compelled to carry a pilot when navigating uponany waters situate withina the imitsof any district for which piltots are licensed by any piotageauthority. The captain of the liangerton ought to have taken in a pi>lot at Dungeness. A Gentleman.-lVo one offered himself there. Captain RoBEaTsoN.-ae should have made a signal foz a pilot.. Cushney said there were always ilots atDungeness. James Newham, a sailor, aged said he had been at sea seven years. He was paid off as an able seaman at Limerick from the Bristol, of Southampton, and was a passenger in the Mangerton. He recollected passing Dungenes3. He had just turned into the fore cabin and heard the word " Port" two or three times before he went upon deck, when he saw a large ship coming athwvart the bowvs of the Man. gerton. He immediatclv jumped dlown below. 31r. YxisDar-Why did you do that ? W-itess-I was afraid of the sticks and the chimney comingdowvn, and did notwant them upon niy heid. iftee the Mangerton had ran into the Josephine tVillis, and, finding nothing Avas falling. I ran forward and had a look where the Mangerton had damaged herself on the la.board bow. I then wvent aft to one of the quarter boats. M{r. YAnDLxr,--Stop; what damage did you see? Witness.-I eould not exactly seethe damage. MUy op'nion was she was serionsly dlanaged. Well, Sir, I san' a child which I thought was in danger and carried it aft, and I andJohn Anderson, my shipmate, helped to removo cargo from the fore part of the Iangerton. I then went aft to the quarterboat with Andersor. I got down the stantackle, and Anderson followed me, and a boy in tha boat wcnt up and got on deck. I sung out for more hands to go off to the Josephune illis, but could get none. Tho plug was out of the boat and se was filling fast, swhen my shipmate called out for the plug, and the stewvar-d threw it; to him. On the way to the Josephine Wiis -we picked up a man named Scott, and saved him. HIe wvas on a life buoy. We went round the stern of the sinking vessel and found nine or ten persons on the mizemast, and took them all off. We were ten minutes to a qurter of an hour proceeding from the steamer to the sinking ship. When -we reached the Josephine Willis we could not see tho hull of the alangerton. By Captain RonEs.Tvso.-When I and Anderson -went into the boat we did it of onr onus accord, to save human life. I asked the second mate of the steamer for mora hands, andhe would not let us have any, and told us to gc by ourselves. His w ords wrere, " Go wvith wvhat vou have." There wrere only us two. We had previously been to the fore hold of the MIangerton, w here the wrater wvas, working at her cargo. No one snggested togobhack to the ship to save more lives. About half an hour after the collision I beard people cry out from the sinking ship, but did not see thenL The boat was half foll of water when ve got into her, in consequence of the plug being out. By Mr. O'Dowd.-The captain of the steamer s.-id nothing tou s. He did not give auy directions to ..nyone to go off in boats to save life, that I could hear. The second mate said. "Go yourselves, and do the best yon can," when I asked him for more hands. There were four oars in the boat, and if wve had had only two more hands we could have reached the Josephine Willis much sooner. By Mr. Parry.-more lives might have been saved it other boats had been sent off from the d hagerton. Mr. YkRDLEv.-I wish everybody had done his duty as you2 and your shipmate hare done. r. Parry.-I have no0 hesitation in saying the conduct ot Newvham and Anderson w,as higohly creditable to themn. Captain ROnBERTSON. _o doubt of it. John Anderson, ordinary.scamnan, late of 'he Bristol, con. firmed the evidence of NTewbam in every espect. By MLr. BalDantine.-The second ~mate went to othmes and desired them to comoe with us, but they would not go, and then he told us to go. There was too mauch water in the boat for twvo hands, but we managed her somehow. By Mr. Pnrry.-Other boats could have put off from2 thC Mrngerton. The lifeboat could have carried SO paengers, and four hands could have navigated her. he thonuht tho sgerton was in danger til the second mate said ea e sohip was built in compartments. I am quite sure more would have been saved if other beats had been sent to the vwreck from the Mangerton. I baled the boat I was in m.yself. Mr. Yar.LlcY askred ferna retuvrn of the ntumber en both1 vessels before the collision. They wvere handed t.o hima. The niumber of passengers was 70, the crew 40-; trtal, 110. Of these 69 perished, and 41 were saved. The passengers and cretw of the M!angerton numbered 67. None of thenm were lost. Mr. YADLE then declared the inquiry to be closed.
