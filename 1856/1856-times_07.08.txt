'We ae ar0cnw looking for the arrival of the Cuna-d .ntee with the news of the decision of the British .Govermment on. Mr. DaLlas'a case. -As Mr. Mawy rSent his despatch one steamer in advanee of MIr. Cranipton (an advantaggefor which he w5aaseverely handled by the Opposition press) it is supposed that wve 3iay sil have to wait arnther week. Meanwhile the uncertainty weighs more or less upon all business transactions, although the general feeling monng merchants is that Mr. Dallas w .i not be .-diriiss'd.- or, if dimissed, that no further trouble *will grow "out of it. 31r. MIathew, the Philadelphia fconsul, oes home by the City of Baltimore, to sail kom Phi 'delphia to-morrow, and carries with him, as did 24r. Cramptom and ler. Barclay, the regrets ,of manypersonal friends who have become attached to him during his long residence in this country. * The tine for the extension of the notice to annul the treaty under which the IJnited States are paying Sound dues to Denmark, having expired on thie 24th inst., it haa been decided that hereafter the dues shal be paid -under protest, leaving the Government to settle it hereafter. I believe I called your attention some months since to a debate in the Senate, questioning the power of the Executive to give the notice without the action of Congress. It -wa Mr. Marcy's original opinion, judging from the fact that application was made to Congress for the passage of a joint resolution directing the notice that such resolution was necessary to authorize the acion of the President. The Cabinet subsequently changed their minds; but the Senate, as you will recollect, took the matter up in a debate in which all the leading members particip3ted, and I understand that the subject wiil not be allowedL to rest. Just now everything has to yield to the pending election. Congress is occupied entirely with the discussion of the sectional issues. The democracy have the control of the Senate, and the Republicans of the House, and the rhole energies of each body are engaged in the contest. The tifve is consumed in criminatinn and recrmi-nation of eaclh section of the Union. Padre Vigil, the Walker Nacaragua envoy, has returned to Central America, not inthe best humour with Washington. Itis very well known in private ercles tnat the Cabinet were divided on the question of receiving him. It was an entire renunciation of the policy which had prevailed up to that time. In my letter by the Ericsson (which may not reach you -nstil you receive this) I called your attention to the Philadelphia resolutions, particularly to the one condemning the Ostend. Conference. Ceolonel Fremont'sletterof acceDtance hasnotyet been published, but he has made a little speech, in reply to an address, in which he says that he has read carefully and approves every resolution in theplatform. So t rmaynow be lookedupon thatthere are two direct issues between the Democrats and the Republicans-frea or slave laboiur in Kansas, and Filibustering or Non-Filibustering. AMr. Fillmaore has returned, and announces his intention to continue a candidate. His friends say little on either of these issues, hoping to draw the moderate mnen from both sides into their ranks. I think from your point of view that you can judge of the probability of this quite as well as a person on the spot. MIr. Fillmore was received 7with a great deal of enthusiasm, and his friends speak with confidence of his chances. The election bids fair to be hotly contested on all sides. The Washington mails bring us the following le*ter from Mr. Marcy to Mr. Buchanan, which was laid before the Senate on Monday - "Department of State, Washington, August 7, 1854. Sir z-The Government of the United States, as you are aware, has strenuously contended for the doctrine that free ships mnae free goods, contraband articles excepted. There is not, I believe, a maritime Power which has not incorporated it in some of its treaties; but Great Britain, which is the most considerable of them, has constantly refused to regard it as a rnle of international law. Her Admiralty Courts have rejected it, and ours have followed after them. When Great Britain and France, at the commencement of the present war with Russia, agreed to act upon that principle for the time being, this Government believed that a fir occasion was presented for obtaining the general consent of commercial nations to recognize it as a principle of the law of nations. "Axintimationor a wish onthe part of the United States to accomplish this object was conveyed to Mr, Seymour, our Minister to Russia, and by him made known to the Government of that country. The Emperor very Promptly furnished his representative here with full power to make a convention on the subject. One was entered into on the 22d day of July, and concurred in by the Senate on the 25th of that month. " By direction of the President, I herewith send you a projet of a similar convention, to be proposed to Her Britannic Majesty's Government. France, as well as other Powers, will also be invited to eater into the same arrangement. " With a view to prevent delays and embaris-sment, the proposed agreement embraces but two rules-first, that free ships make free goods, except articles contraband of var; and, secondly, that the property of neutrals, not being contraband, found on enemies' vessels, shall be exempted from confiscation. This latter rule is not, like the first, contested; yet there is an obvious propriety in embracing both in the same arrangement. Were it omitted, it might be again <uestioned, in consequence of the establishment of the principle that the neutral flag protects the property under it. An attempt might be made to infer from that principle that the flag determined the character of the property under it. " I do not apprehend any serious opposition to the proposed convention except from Great Britain. But for her resistance to the principle that the neutral flag protects property which it covers, if it be not contraband, it would long ago have been regarded as a well established rule of international law. She has impliedly admitted its justice by adoptig it as the guide of her conduct in the present war, If it is fair towards neutrals to act upon it now, it Will be difficult for her to devise good reasons for not obserringitinallfuturewars. Iamconfidentyonwillbeable to overcome any reluctance on the part of the Government of Great Britain to adopt it as a role of international law. " With this instruction you will receive the President's fnll power to conclude the proposed convention. "I am, Sir, respectfuUly, your obedient servant, "W. L. YAscEY." In a late r-an through the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois I was struck with the prommnLt2g appearance of the crops everywvhere. Since then we have had a great deal of rain, much more than is usu2al jn the month of June. -I do not yet learn that any injulry has been done, or that, except b)eing backward, the crops are less promising than I have made every effort to get a copy of the points decided by the Court of Appeals in the case involving thte qulestion of the fraudulent issue of stcok by lr. Robert Schuyler, and have not succeeded. I mnay possibly have a despatch before the steamer sails, but, in case I do not, I send the following extract from the Tribune of this mornIng:- " We have raid but little about the decdsion of the Court c Appeals th case of she MechanicsBanks because we coaldantgeetany reliable information in regard to the real points of the decision, and because we could not believe that the Court cuuld nanimouly make such an unjust decision as ha7 been stated. Under such a decision no one could be a momentsofo2nholdigstockor dealing in stock i any inco rpted corpany whatever. A certificate of stock issUed by the reo ly appointed officers, and standing in the name of the owner on the books of the company, would be no evidence of ownership, and on the public would rest the risk of fruads upon the part of offlcers of corporations, in whose appointment they had no voice, and not upon the corporation that appointed and afforded the opportunities for frands. In regard to this matter the Postsays:- " 'We are informed that the Court has only decided that to recover in a court of law on stock it must be held in the plaintiff's name on the beoks of the company. Holding certificates alone vdill not do. In the su7it of the Mechanics Bank, though the stock was properly tranisferr-ed to it, and appeared so on the hooks of the company, yet by an oversight it was not proved so in court, and the Court decided as though it was not.'"'

BMNRR IFF. : -- - T .UME _ FA. '. I . The following curious correspondence is published in the Charlesto Atei-cury, United States:- 'CTo "on. Pzestoa S Broo - Charleston, Monday. "Dear Sir,-The undersigned citizens of Charleston, in their own behalE and in behalf of many others, beg your acceptanco of the cccompanying cane. It has been purchased with the contribution of the smalest coin in use by those who sympithize with and support you in the position you now occupy, in consequence of your recent chatisement of the senator from Masssachusetts. We are proud to say that we know of no one in this metropolis who does not share with you in the lust indignatior which the speech of that senator provoked, and who, does not approve the inStinct which prompted you to the punishment of one whose scurrility should deprive him of senatorial protection, as it has already taken from him senatorial respect. His incendiary and treasonable orations are but the efdAences of the, length to which the toleration of irresporsible facZionists will lead th ee whose love of country is lost in the desire to gratify selfish notoriety at any cost. Your rebuke, it is hoped, will satisfy such men that there are conseauences beside those provided by law for which they mustiprepare. It is not because this senator has been pleased to advocate doctrines the practical adoption of wbich would developem as the least of its evils, a dissolution of the Union, nor because that in doing so he has exhibited a temper so senfish in its tendencies and indecent in its development as to cause every true lover of his country to regret that he sits iz the Senate Chamber. of the Union; but it is because he has dared, iln contravention of all propriety, and with studied contempt of all decorum, to introduce oir State in his debate in terms so gross and insulting that no son of hers could have remained unmoved. In your case additional aggravation was found in the fact that the terms in which your venerable rdative was refirred to made it your duty, in his absence, to punish the aggressor. You have put tho senator from Yassachusetts where he should be. You have applied a blow to his back. He has undergone the infamy of personal punishment. His submission to your blows has now qualified him for the closest companionship wiith a degraded class. Bult any class, h1owever degraded, will regard wzith indifference one who, noisy in the assertion of another's rights, is indisposed to assert his own. "With great respect, yours truly-S. S. Farrar, James G(llleand, X Canady, E. J. Dawson, W. B. Carlisle, and others." ' Washinglon, D. C., Thursday, June 12. S. Farrar, Esq.-M1y dear Sir,-I beg to tender my respectful acknowledgments to yourspli and the gentlemen associated with you, for the handsome cane received a few days sinct by express. The act which you are pleased to commend was the result of a sense of duty-a duty which either of my colleagues would have cheerflly performed had they been in my precise situation. I accept the Palmetto cane as an evidence of the generosity of my friends In Charleston, ad not for any merit of my own. I have the honour to be, respectfully and truly, your friend and servant, " P.

TEruxic Smmoms CAOusD By AiNTtoNy.-Dr. Efliotson comniunicates to the Afedica Timnes of Saturday two cases which have occurred within his practice of tetanic symptomls arismg from antimony. The patients were infants, the one 14, the other eight months old. Dr. Elliotson, alluding to the Rugeley case, remarks:-"During the whole of Cook's attacks of vomiting, diarrhcca, and depression no tetanic symptoms occurred till the Monday night before his death upon the Tuesday night. There is no reason to suppose that strychnine had up to that time been given,- to supoose that Palmer had not trusted to antimony alone in order to kIll Cook. It was cunning in him to select antimony. A soporific would have suggested foul play by the stupefaction ; prassic acid might havegiven an odour perceptible to those around; ansemc would have been too common a poison not to have been easily detected. Antimony was the least likely to excite suspicion or be thought of. le seems to have trusted to it till he was out of patience and probably expected to find Cook dead when he returnedtoRugeleyfromLondon on the M aonda night. he did notgive quantities sufficient to excite tetnric symptoms; pro0bably he feared to use larger quantities, lest eacn administration shouldX produce burningpin at the stomach, be instantly followed by vomiting, and ,ead to certain detection of crime. There is no reason to suppose that be had any deep views of preparing the system for the action of staychir e, wfhich is potent enough without preparation, or of rendering the detection of strychnine by the chymist more d7ificult, which is not known to he a fact. is coume appears to have been simple enough-to attempt to murder Cook by antimeony, us he probably bad murdered his other victims, sad, not succeeding so soo n as he anxionsly desired, to resort at the last moment to strychnine, with which also be failed, till on the uesda;y night he gave it again+"

THE CAMP AT ALDERSHOTT. I There was to have been a review at Aldersholt yesterday, but the Queen's usual good fortune in matters meteorologicalforsook her, and torrents of rain confined HerMajesty to the Pavilion, while hundreds of her subjects, whom the expectation of a brDliant field-day had attracted from London, roamed disconsolately over the heath, till, all prospect of an improvement in the weather having vanished, they at last rductantly surrendered the happy hopes with which they had quitted home, and returrned to town wetter, if not wiser people than they had left it. Her Majesty, accompanied by 'he Prince Consort, the Prince of Wales, the King of the Belgians, Prince Oscar of Sweden, the Count of Flanders, Princess Mary of Cambridge, the Duke of Cambridge, and the Duchess of Cambridge, left the Royal station, NXine Elms, at 1 oclock, and on arriving at the Farnboroughi station was received by a guard of honour of the 15th ressars, which escorted the Royal party to the Pavilion. Among the distinguished persomn present were Lord and Lady Hardinge, the American Maister, Colonel Cunningham, Colonel Wetherall, Mr. Miles, M.P., &c. About 4 o'clock, when the clouds had graciously granted a momentary armistice, the Duke of Cambridge, with the Duchess, and the Princess Mary, d; ove round the camp in a carriage-and-four. The appearance abroad of the illustrious party revived the hope that in the event of the weather continuing fine there would be, even at that late hour, if not a review, at least a parade. The visitors listened eagerly for the bugles to sound the "Assembly," but in a few minutes the sky became again overcast, and no more welcome sound met the ear than the flapping of the wet canvas in the tented field, and the whistling of the wind over the bleak and shelterless moor. Should the weather prove more propitious there wil be a review to-day. The Queen means to inspect the troops at 8 o'clock in the morning, and after the evolutions a ceremony of more than ordinary interest is expected to take place. It is understood to be HEer Majesty's gracious intention to call forward the sergeants and a private of each company of the three battalions of Guards, together with all the officers, and, when they have formed a circle around her, to read to them a brief address, expressive of Her Majesty's high sense of their gallant conduct during the late war. The Scots Greys and the 11th Hussars came into camp from Portsmouth in the course of the day. The 7th, 19th, and 79th Regiments of Infantry arrived last week. Shortly after the arrival at the Pavilion, and while Her Majesty was in conversation with Viscount Eardinge in the State room, an accident of a somewhat -singular nature befell that gallant veteran. Hao had been seated on a couch, resting his arm on a table running on castors, and as he was about to rise he leant rather heavily on the table, which catsed it towas p from under him, and losing his balance he Fell, injUriDg his foot severely. His Lordship was raised from the ground and removed to head-q,uarters in great agony, and upen a surgeon arriving from the hosgpital department it was found that the ankle was so swvollen and inflamed that it was difficult to say whether the joint was sprained or fractured. At his own request he w.s removed in an easy carriage to Farnborough, whence he was conveyed by special train to town, and thence to his residence. Her blajesty expressed grcat anxiety at the occurrence, and repeatedly sent Colonel idduiph tk make inquiries as to Lord Hlardinge's injuries.
COURT CIBCULAP1 The Queen went yesterday afternoon to the camp atA1dershott, ior tae purpose of reviewingi the regiments of the Guards and of the Line which have lately returned from the Crimea.

C. B. Phi ps, Colonol de Moerkerke, Lord Charles Fitzroy, Colonel Loven, Colonel F. H. Seymour, Captain Bnrnell, Mr. Due, and Mfr. Gibbs. The Royal cortEgc consisted of five camriages, with an escort of Light Dragoons, and proceeded frcm the Palace to the private station at Vauxhall, where a special train was in readiness which conveyed the Queern and party to Pamborough. Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent visited the Queen yesterday morniing at Buckiedgham Palace. Her Royal Eighness, attended by Lady Anna Maria Dawson, afterwards went to Twickenham, to visit the Duke and Duchess d'Aunmale. Mr. Boys' engraving of "Her Majesty opening the Great Exhibition of 1851," has been submitted to the Queen.

NAWAB OF S1RT TRE ATY BIILL Eord LYNDsrution asked whether the opinion of the laTw offcers of the Crown had been ta.en upon the const.- tion of the treaty entered into with the late Nawab of Simt, and wheers their opinion, if tdken, would ha lid onthe table of the house? ' The Dukee of ARGYLL was not iaware that any formal question had been put to the law officers of the Crolwn with regard to the construction of the treatyC The Marquis of CtoNeICARDE, before. moving the second reading of the bilU, asked the noble duke to infonn 1dm what course the Government intended to adont with respect to it ? The Dakeof ARGYLL said, he inte ndedto t ait until he heard the reasons stated by the noble lord for asking the House to aoree to the second reading of this bil, when he intended to ask the Chairman of Committees whether this was such a bil as oughtto be considered a private bill. The-Ear1ofELLEBOROUJGH Sished to ask the noble duk;e whether he was prepared to give the assent of the Government to this riU, affecting as it did revenues which the East India Company only held as trustees for the The Duke of XGYLL was certainly not empowe red to vthe consent of the CrowCn to this bill. LordRBEDESDAL^E, as Chairmnan of Committees, thought thatthis, being aabil which affcted the publc revenne, ought not tobe treated as an ordinary pnvate bilLG The bll had coni before him as an Hnopposeu ptivate biUl, and he couldnot take the responsibility of stoppin in inhis capacity of Chairmandf Committees; but hegthought the bill came before their lordships so irregulsrly as a private bill that he intended to move that it be read a second time that day si; months. He felt very strongly that it w;as a bil which, in its present shape, ougat not to be agreed to by their lordships. The Marquis of CLutICAbereE said, that no doubt this HiU afeted a portion ofat e revenues ofthe empire and their lordships ought to have the advice of the Govern ment upon such a question, He thought that the bil was one upon which the aw officers of the Crown ought to have been consulted. The Solicitor-General had spoken in favour of this bil, and he had, therefore, a right to dasme that, so far as the law off icers of the Crotn had been consulted, their opinion was favourable to this bill. The President of the Board of Control had begged the other House to consider that they wero acting judiciall, and he made the same request to their lordships. It was said that this bill ought to be treated as a public measure, He was informed that the promoters of the biUl wished it to be treated as a public bill, and he saw no reason why it should not be so considered. But to resort to his objection at the present stage of the bill seemed to him to be an evasion of justice and a course - worthy of the Governmest and of the East India Cornpay. All that the parties interested wanted, and all that he asked on their behalf, was that the question should be sent before some tribunal capable of investigating the iustice of the claims; and whether that tribunal were the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council or some other competent body wrasagmatterl pon which the promoters waere indifferent The bill arose upon the construction of a treaty entered into by the Indian Government in the year 1800 wpith the Nawab of Surat. The whole q .estion twured upon the constrhction of of th rdsn of the treaty, and whether the Goverument were hound to pay to the heirs of the late Ntawab the sum of 15,0(31. a-year. The meaning ohf the ord "Nawab" was an; officer employed under the Mogul empire, and when that empirefell into decline many of thle Nawrabs usurpoed the places wvhich they originally held. That was the asse at Surat, and, so far from our esablishing the first mawab, we wrent there with the mtention of putting another man in his place, butfouhd that the Nawab in. possession was too strong, and that, instead of disturbing it was better to enter into treaty with him. The Nawabship was always considered hereditary, with this chance incidenal to it-that a weak price was verylikely to be set aside for a strong one; butathe Nawabs were not elected likejtbe formerki'ngs of Poland or emperors of Germany, neither were they appointed by the English Government. They succeeded from father to son and from son to grandson by right of inheritanee. It was, however, se matter who had succeeded to the Nawabhein of Surat, because, if inl800tlseEsatlndiaCompanystipulated by treaty to paya ertain annuityo to the heirs of a faiab oSuasolng as that race lasted, they were bound to pay it. The question arose wrhether the annuity was payable to the heirs of the family, including heiresses, or to the heirs and successors to the Nawnbship. The opponents of this bill said, the male issue of the Nawvab of Surat failed in 1842, and thereupon the liability to pay the annuity ceased. But, on the death of the last Nawab, neither Sir George Arthur, Governor of Bombay, nor M1r. Elliot, Resident at Surat, who were directed to make inquiries, ever expressed any doubt as to the annuity being payable; the only nestion mooted was to whom was it to be paid? had been asked why had not the petitioner applied to a public tribunal in lndia but the answer was that the petitioner could not do any such thing, as the questions in dispute would involve the construction of the terms of a treaty-a power which- courts of justice did not possess. Thus the petitioner could not apply to the Privy Council, neither could he appeal to a court of law, and therefore he had adopted the only course open to him, and appealed for justice, as every British subject should appeal, to the Parliament of England. He (the Alarquis of Cianricarde) quite aarced that it would have been desirable had thie matterbeen settled out of that house, but the petitioner had no means of obtaining justice elsewheze. It was stated that great constitutional questions were involved in this matter, and he (the Marquis of Clauricarde) admitted it, for what could be a greater constitutional question than the good government of an immense population ? There was another and a distinet part of the bill before the House, which related to the real and personal property of the late Nawab, 2especting which a decision had been pronounced by the Governor of Bombay in Council and against which all parties were anxious to appeal. They found. however, that they had no appeal to the Privy Council; for, upon maling the experiment, the Prig Council declared itself incompetent to entertain the appen, as it had not been refcrred to them by the Queen. Another plausible objection had been raised in the petition which had been laid upon their lordships' table, that the bill affected the rights of different parties who had received no notice and were resident in a distant country. The fact was, there was not one interested person who had not full notice of the bill, and was not fully cognizant of its progress, Every party had appealed from the decision of the Governor of Bombay; the bill itself was propounded last session, and had been intended as a public bilL The highest authority in the other house -the Speaker-decided that it could not be introduced as a puble bill. The noble lord, the Chairman of Committees, now said this was not a subject for a private bill. The applicant did not care whether it came on in the shape of a private or of a public bill, or whether any other remedy could be ;roposed for his gftevance. It ivas because he (Lord Clanncarde) was anxious to kmnow whiether the Government intended to propose any other remedy for an admitted wrong that he had ventured to ask the noble duke (Argyll) whether the Government had arrived at any conclusion apon the subject. 'The noble duke could not deny that a wrong had been done. It had been admitted in the other house by the President of the Board of Control; it had been admitted by the Solicitor-General, who voted for the bill entirely upon grounds of justice. The Government could not venture to set aside a celam ivas whic wssupported by such high authority. The b i as referredl to a, select committee of the House of Commons, which was conposed chiefly of lawyers eminent fortheir ability and knowledge of the law, among whom was Mr. Butt and Mr. Napier, lately Her -Majesty's Attorney-General for Ireland; but there was not onie of them who was not at the present moment qualied to take his scat on the judlicial bench. These four lawyers were appointed to inquire into the subject, and the committee was presided over by Mir. Cardweil ; and would any man dleny that that right hon. gentleman, by his intellectual powers, attain- ients, and habits -was nlot as able to enter into a legal aTgument as any man in either house of Pailiament? Thus, then, they had a tribunal fit to try any case, and they a1l reported in favour of the bil; hut they at the same time stated that there were considerations of policy which might be involved in the question which they did not think it their duty to report upon. The bill was passedl by the Honse of ommns y alare mjorty,andwas supported by every lawyer iyn the heousme,exeyptonehon. and learned gientleman,t who,thoughundoubtedely netretained to speakS aganstit itcoud ot e dnid bd benfor manyyer one or the leading counsel of the East India Comp^any Every man who had examined into the facts of the case had said that injustice had been commritted which required redress by Parliament. He did not ask their lordships to decide the question upon his mere advocacy, but accrding to the plain construction which any man would put upon the words " his heirs." But he did implore their lordahips not to shut the door against inquiry to a person who had brought a case before them so sustained. Let it not be said that there were wrongs that might be committedby apowerfuil corporation, and that Parliament would not attempt to remedythose wrongs, Were theirlordships to sanctionsuch a principle, they would be taking one great step towards shakng the allegiance of the people of India and of endan- gering the whole of our Indian empire. All, therefore, that he entreated thair lordehips to do was, not to send back to India these persons who asked for a hearing until their case had been heard and fairly and impartially decided. The Duke of ARGYLL said, he should support the motion of his noble friend the Chairman of Committees, thatthe bill be read a second time that day three months. Undoubtedly his noble friend made that motion on a suestion of form; but, although in coming. to that vote itmight practically be one on a point of form, yet he hoped to convince thexrlordahipathat they would not he doine any ir$uatire to the merits of the case. But before he proceeded to the question itself he trusted he might be allowed to sa a single word upon thius point of foam. Although it W35 the prvile'e of the subject to have privae legia. lation for the promotion of private and peraoual iuterest, yet it often happened that those riate ubi affeeteA qvm. tions of great. pulblie-policy. ronadering, therefore, thaf, ra xivatie hilla they were often promosed by active per- Ã¯Â¿Â½0canlVass, . t was highly necessr for tthe: sae of- {he interests of the- connthj tinxt the partiesl conneteid -with those bills shor d be required to observe the rules laid down hy Pariaent .n repect to the pssung of private biul, Binding, then, the Chir man of Committees repudiaing this hilL asa Xprivate bi, he thought it -was a strong presmoption a tht the bill was iMegitimate in its nature, ad that w deslt with a subjet in a manner wbich ought not t e tolerAted. This bi hadbeen referredto the Standing Orders Committee, and which committee had reported that they had mirnxtely inquired into this bill ; and they found that none of the standing orders which were applicable to private bills previously to the second reading were applicable to this bill. 3bVAt did this mean ? It meant that no such case was made out by the parties as was conteniplated by the committ'ee -when those orders were made. what did this bill do as regasdod the revenue of the Crown ? It affected no less a sum thanhalf-a-million sterling. Ana, as regarded private rights, he must maintain, in swite of the argument of his oble -friend, that one part of the bill would have a most injurious effect upon the private rights of several poor individuals who w'ere totaly unrepresented in this country. Under these circumstances, it was not a mere matter of form that their lordships s:aould strictly adhere to their standing orders, flue should be ashamed to m3ke this appeal to their standing orders if he thought it would be a denial of sub. stantial justice to the parties; but he maintained that no substantial injustice had been committed in this case. The bill itself concernedmainly two questions-one, a queion respecting the dispesal of a perpetual annuity, given by the. 3ast India Company in the year 1800 to the person claiming to be the heir of the late Nawab of Surat; and the other a question respecting the distribution of the private estate of that 1Wawab. He should confine himself to the first question. In the year 1800. the late , Nawab of Surat die, Iord Wellesley was at that time Governor-General of India. The East India Company felt t.hemeselves entitled to take into their IhandsDthe govex-ment of Surat; and Lord WYellesley accord! ing sent down an agent with instructions not to allow the person claimningthe navabahip to assume the government of Surat, except under the termas of a treaty to be entered into. He wrould read to ther lordships the terms of that treaty, on -which the whole queston depended- The preamble of the treaty rn thus :-" Artices of agreement between the East India Coipany and their suecessors and the Narwab of Surat, his heirs and successors." It was perfectly true that, inrwhat might be called the enacting clauses of the treaty, the word "successors" was dropped, and the word " heirs" only was used ; but it would presently heseen what interpretation this word wasto bear. Immediately after the death o. the Nar ab, in 1842, upon whose death without male heirs this question had arisen, Sir George Arthur, then Governor of Bombay, drew up a report upon the question, and said that on the whole he was inelinedtocometo the conclusion that the Company were bound to continue the annuity of 15,0001. a-year to the personal heirs and family of the Nlawab of Surat. Governor Duncan, in his private diary, also spoke of the pension continung until the awab's heirs became estinct, but from other narts of this diary, where it was declared that the Naerab ead his family shouid be secured in constant succession to the nawabship, he gathered that in the treaty, as well as wen Governor Duncan spoke of the heirs becomirg extinct, he was sdeaid g of heirs to the nav abship. The decision of the (auvernor of Bombay was in due course referredto his noblefEierd opposite (theaiarl of EllenborOugh), then Governor-General of India, who, having before him the minute of Sir George Arthur, the diary of Governor Duncan, and all the evidence which the claimabt could brng before hnm, decided that with the title and office of ltawah e.spired all claim to the money which the British Government engaged tofpay annually by the tresty of 180Q. That money, sa id his lordship, was clearly to be paid as the sxurplus of the State revenue, after defraying all charges; it would be paid to the Naw ab as Nawab; it was not made private property, to be severed from the State whEen the heads of the State failed. This was the decision not of the Court of Directors (who, he feared, were at the present moment exceedingly obnoxious, and who had incurred a great deal of public oMiunm in this matter), but it was the interpretation put upon the treatylby the then Governor-General of Idia,u under the guidance and advice of the able men whom he had with hi in council at that time. This very minute vwas signed by Mr. Thonuason, one of the very ablest men brought up in the .East India service, and whose administration as Governor of the North-Western provinces had been the subject of such just eulogy. Surely the House would be satisfied with such authority. It was not usual for Rarliament to interfere vith the construction of tTeaties unless some injustice had evidently been done by the constituted authorities, and he called upon any independent member of their lordships' House to say whether there was such a prirnu facie case of gross injustice as would justify Parliament in interfering in this question either by a private or a public bill? As to the decision of Sir George Arthur, he strongly suspected that that decision was not so much founded upon a StriCt construction of the treaty as an act of liberality on the part of the East India Company, failinug male heirs and failing the nawabship, nevertheless to continue the pension as a matter of grace and favour to the members of his family. lIe was very much confirmed in this impression by a minute drawn up by Mr. Anderson, then a member of Sir George Arthur's Council, who said he doubted if, at the time the treaty was entered into, the lapse of the nawabship was thought of; he believed the pension was intended for those who filled the nawabihip. Iif Anderson's opinion wasthatthoannmity wastobetiedup with the title, and in another minute Sir George Arthur saidhe owas glad.Mr. Andersonis opinion coincided with his own. He (the Duke of Argyl) thoulght, then, he was justified in assuminE that iir George's decision wvith regard to the pension was not founded upon the legal merits of the case, but was merely a generous concession made upon a liberal consideration of all the circumDstances of the case. The noble marquis had endeavoured to cast odium upon the Government of India, as directed by the East India Company, with regard to this matter; but, in point of fact, he could only find that two documents had been sent by the Board of Directors bearingupon the case, and both were to the effect that larger pensions than had been awarded by the local Government should be granted to the family of the late 2Nawab. The Government of Bombay, acting upon the general instructions of the Board of Directors, had appointed an agent to inquire into and report upon the circamstances of the case and upon the pensions allotted to every member of the family of the late liawab. The result of that report had been that the Board of Directors had informed the local Government that the pensions which had been allotted were not sufficiently large. Was it, then, fair to take advantage of a passing feeling of hostility against the East India Company in order to bring charges of such a characte- aaminst them. For his own part, he was prepared to maintain thatthe East India Company had behaved well towards the famnily of the late l.awab of Seat, and he hoped that the noble marquis would not suspect them or the Government of w;ishing to bebave shabbily towards that family. As regarded the course -which Her Majesty's Government proposed to pirSae, he was not prepared to sav that the Government might not refer to the Judicial Comsmittee of the Privy Council a question arising out of this case for their decision (hear, hear) ; but, even if they did, it was difficult to determine what course it would be expedient to pursue, whatever might be the decision of the Judicial Committee. But, notwithstanding that difliculty, he wished to impress upon their lordsh1ips that the Government in rejecting the present bill, and in calling upon the House to reject it, by no means precluded themselvesbfrom sach reconsideration of the case as the circumstances of it cmiht appear to requre. Great odiuam had been reast upon theaEastIndia Company with regard to this transaction, but he would ben the attention of their lordships to some oe o e facts of the case. Their lordshipswere awre that it was one of the privileges of high rank in India not to be subject to local purisdiction, and there was a special agreerent with the ?Nawab of Surat that he should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of the country. Whea the late yawab died a question arose as to the disposition of his propertv, and, on the suggestion of Mr. Axbuthnot, a special act was passed to appoint an agent to incuire into ahd decide fuonlthe subject, and providing that against that decision there shold be no appeal, and to that act the claimant in the present case was a consenting party, andnot only was he a consenting party, but he objected that under the second clause of the act, as it was originally drawn up, the agent was not entitsed to deal as freely with the property as he ought to be, and he suggested a clause giving the aent fuller pocer, and that clause wbas the very one against which he now protested. It was preposterous that the claimant in the present case should now come before Parliament and represent thathe was precluded fromappealwvhen hehad himseelf acquiescedinthat excelusion. Itwoald he imnpossihiefor the Goverument to consent to havc the case reopenedaasthis billattemupted to re-open it, when a number of persons, many of them comparatively noor, had for several years been in potsession of this propenty under the conviction that the matter had been finally decided. The Governmnent were not takring advantage of a mere question of form. They denied the justice of this person's claim, end they thought it would be unjust Ito the Government of India and the parties concerned to reopen the question, either by a public or a private bilL. |The Earl of ALBETIXARL13 concurred -with the observations of the noble marquis wvith regard to the Government of India, hut he rose to make a few strictures upon the petition which had been presented by the East India Comnpany. What was the Company?v Why, for 3S years it had been a- hoard subordinate to the Q,overnmen-a - part of the Legislature. What business, then. had one part of the Government to he heard at the bar against anotherpart? TheTreasuryortheAdmiraleymightjustaswel apply to be heard against their supe.iors. The petiion stated this was the Ã¯Â¿Â½rst private bill whichhadever dealt with a subject of this lnd. Bet in 1S33, when a case of a similar character ocourred, the complainant, Alr. Hodges,obtainedredressbymeansofaprivatebilLThepetition further stated that the treaty in question was made by Lord We-lesley, when in fact it was made by Governor Duncan; and that the first of the line of the N2awab had been placed on the murnud in 1759 by the authority of the Coimpany, the truth being (according to Governor Dnmcan's account) that he obtained possession of the Nawabship, not through the agency of the Company, but by his own exertions. Another statement made by the Detition was that previous to 1S00 the Company had alvajs refused to nelmowledge the office of liawab as hereditary, wher-eas it appeared, from Governor Duncan, that the Bengal Government before that date were of opinion that the edest son of a former NavWal bad a claim to thoffice by right of inheritance.

The Xarl of EL NiWROUGH tught tba the nldil - duk*e bad goae so atiÃ¯Â¿Â½aatorilyinto this qaueAim thatit was nopt necesary for him to ieamn their lardhiplt .syleigth. He bd been onmany ocsics oompelledto differ from the Court of Directors of the, E&it&ndia Compmny, but he wausatisfied nowthat, consilering the pcoitiont auxit they had only done- theirAduty as resimtatives of t peDple of Indi& (Hear) For the quioni-mowbeforetheir lo03hips wa not one betwaen the promaoters of this bi:l and the East India CoampaKn, who hd no personal intzee. inthis xatter; the questionws on between theproraomter of ti bill and the people o E India, whom money Ee de6ired to, take away for his private epoae, ashe (the ArlI of Monlborough) believed aronaly, vnd therefore he opred the bill As far bak as the yearl800 a negotiator h madea trextyin hi:b,like areeuit diplomatiWhe hbadnot eane hieself -with sufficient precision. He had no doesb that the idea of the continuaton of the pension guaranteed . tothe Nawab to his female clewendantts never could har e- O- curredto GovemorDunca-as theposEibieconstrution of the tre;ty, HIe never could have supposed that the descaidsatcotdd claim nything that ws not pat and -pax-celof the nawabahip. The Govermuent consulted with.ir.Thosa2ron, - who waa perhaps more coapetent thbm any ore else to Pie an opinion on this subject, and who was not only an .bleandthoroul Yonscientious mian, but intimately con,terswt with l=mstern habrt: Land Easte-m customs and. with: Mfahomedaulaw. Thepresent question1 indeed, seen.ed to' him to he one, not so much for Elsb, as for iahonsed. - law. The treaty as an Indan treaty, contactebetween -Indian potenthdes. while our lawyers ha. construied it they would have co e. an English deed, giving an anty to the descendants of an Ensh nobleman. The treaty c ine nnder the.. consideration of the Indi Govenent in 1843. The. documents most have been in the possession of the Presidesit of the Board of Control (Lord Ripon) in November of that year, and it -was for him, il he-thoughtthatanerroneousim- pression prevailed, to cailfar the opinion of the law ofiloars of - theCrown. Hc(theEarl of Elleaborough)hddonethat atthe. Board of Control-whenever he bad doubts as to the legaiy of anyindian decisions,so Ihat the law might be correcied if it were erroneouTs. That decision haa been adopted liv twoIndian Governmensts, and bad beensdhered to by th.~ee or - fourPresidents ofthelloard.of Contrcl. Would theirlord.ehips allowrhim tobringthe qusstionlinto2Eu.rope, and to place it more palpably before them thn if it were an ndia question? Let him imagine the possibility that the princi. pelities of loldinie and WVallachia, wrhich now acknow.. -ledged the suzerainty oE the Porte, and paid to ita certain sum, desired to selieve themselves from, their nominal suzerainty, sndthat they were permitted ta do so, upon condition that they contracted to psy a certain annual sum to the Sultan and lin heirs. Was there any man in that house or in Europe who vvovud say that, if te dignity of the Sultan wer extinguished the principalities of Ifoldavia and Wallachia would continue after the decease of the Sultan to pay the money to the Pasbas who had married his daughters? (Hear.) Why, such an interpretation would be repudiated by the common sense of mankind. In any public treaty it would be the-conrmon, understanding of uriopean-iationsthattlesnauity appleiedonly to heirs male. In India there was no knowledge of heirs female, or of any suierainty as attached to them. He could not attach great weight to the opinion of a purely English lawyer nwon a matter of Mahomedan law -- hut,considerieg the knowledge of Eastern habits and Indianlaw possessed by Mr. Pemberton Leigh and the Judicial Comunittee of the :Privy Coancil, he should feel satisfied if the true constrnction of the treaty were submitted to -hat body. (Hear, hear.) What he desired was to get the'matter- out of that House and out of Farliament (Hear, hear.)-. The biM was a bad precedent. (Hear.) Already he knew of two or three similar cases, which were onlyawaiting the decision which their loridships mnight come to; and he would caution their lordships that if they took this first step they woufld find B very difficult tosop. (Hear, hear.) He deeply regretted that it should have been necessa.-y for the P'rivv Council to decline to entertain the. -appeaL lt bad been done, and there was no remedy;- but.. the conclusion which would be most satisfactory to him would be for the promoters of the bill to be placed exactly where they would have been if the Brivy Councl had been able to entertain the appeal (Hear, hear.) He thought that, as regarded the most important points on which rested the cLaim of the petitioners, the viewtaken had not been that of a judicial mind, and that, most probably, the decision of the Judiclal Committeeo f the Privg Council wouldreverse it. Ho earnestly desired,to submit to that tribunal the question whether bythe treaty of 1S00 the annuity granted to the Nawab and his heirs was descendible to heirs general, or only to hirsmale. (Cheers.) The lalarquis of CLA.ICARDE, in reply, said he should' feel confident that justice would be done if the noble duke told them the question should be judicially investigated, and the judgment arrived at carried into practical effect ;- but he thought the conduct, of the East India Company.- bad been un-wise and reprehensible. Lore DENfIALN supported the amendment. On the question being put, the amendment was agreed ao,. and the bin was consequently lost. CONVOCATION. LordIREDESDALE preseated3 petition "from certain members of the convocation of the provinee of York, showing that, while the prelates and clergy of the province of Canterbury have lately deliberated in. convocation on divers questions afi'ectino the welfare of the church, and have ap. pointed committees to consider the best means of imlproving the discipline of the clergy, all opportunity of participatingt innuch deliberations has been denied to the convocation of the province of York, equally interested in the subjects discussed, and containing a feller representation of the parochial clergy than that of Canterbury; and praying the House, before proceeaing with the Church Discipline Bill, or any measure specifically aifecting the clergy, to address Her M:ajesty, or otherwise procure that the same may be submitted to the clergy of both provinces in ther convocations now lawfully in being under the Royal vrits addressed to both archbishops respectively." Be thuorght it unjust that one set of proceediags should be adopted with regar to the province of Canterbury, and another mode of proceeding -with respect la the provnace of York. He entertained a strong opinion that if the convocation of the province of Yorl: was rut noon a proper footing much good might resultfrom it. Hethouglit the manner in which the proedings in convocation of the province of Canterbury were conducted showed that all those apprensions which had been entertained by parties as to tbeir danserous cha-actcr were altogetherunfounded. Of course, in all public assemblies they must expect differences of opinion, and when discussions tooklplace they were nod always conducted in the manner in which it could be wished they should be; but because matters of difference p,ight occur that- vac no argminent against sunh assembliesaltogether. T-was very desirable that the church should represent itself. At the presentmoment the churchwas abusedfor many things for which it was really not responsible, and il was unjust that it should not be allowed to express its opinion as to what should be done in reference to such onestions. At the same time, some improvement ought, he thought, to take place in the constitution of the bodies to which he was referring, and the first and most obvious improvement was the fusion of the two prOVinCes. NYothingt he was awvare, could be done now bey1ond calling public attentionto the matter, but he hoped some attention would be given to the subject of the petition, and that the s.on - privileges would be given tothe convocation of one province as were enjoyed by the other.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE. CAI'E. The nomination for this borough will take place on Wednesday next. No opposition will be offered to Sir Willinm Fenwick Williams of 3ars, although probably a gentleman from the BaUot Society will present himself on the hustinga, for the nzupose merely of advocating the views of that association. The Earl of Shelburne has issued the following address tD Eis late constituents:- "1 Gentlemen,-Itis not without regret that I address you upon the present occasion, when I am about to terminate the political connexion *hich has existed for many years between the electors of this borough and myself ;but on the other hand, Her Majesty's Government having been pleasel to offer me the office of Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, I have not been able to resist the opportunity thus offered to me of endeavouring, at least, to prove myself a useful public servant, especially as the business of the department m which I am about to serve has alvways been a subject of particular interest to me. This step necessarily entails, in the present instance, the loss of the seat which I have now the honour of holding in the House of Commons; but although, having accepted office, I have no alternativa bu4 that of retirng from the representation of your borough, I have still the good fortune, unlike many representatives in Earliament, of being able to look forvard, to many OOppOrtunities of meeting you, and preserving, I hope, your esteem as a friend and neighbour, whien I have ceased to be your mnember. I The indulgence you havs always shown me, and the conidence youhaveplacedin me, I can never forget, and I should be most ungrateful if they had not left the mosb lastig impression on my mind. "I have reason to believe that, although the circumstances which I have mentioned will prevent my serving you in the House of Commons, I shall still find myself in zi position in which opportunities may present themselves of a;ttending to your local interests; and I need scarcely add that anything which concerns your borough will always command my best attention. "I remain, your faithful servant, "london, July 4. - "'Ssmes-uitxm A third candidate for the seat rendered vacant by the succession of Viscount Dungarvan to the :Earldom of Cork and Orrery has appeared in 'the person of Lord Edward Thyne, uncle of the present Marquis of Bath. His Lordship comes forward in the C7onservative interest, and if the iberalinterest is divided by Major Boyleand.Mr nicoll, beth going to the poll, the return of Lord E dard is not au improbable event.

Lord MEsBomurE used to say that he always suspected a measure when the principal argument for it was that " something must be done." It is true that necessity is the mother of invention, but this maxim applies more to the creations of art than to' the growth of a legal system and the development of a political constitution. We believe that " something must be done" to provide a proper Court of Appeal for this country, but the particular scheme for thia purpose must have a great deal more to recommend it than an argument which applies equally to all schemes, good or bad. That, however, is nearly all that the clear-headed and eloquent lawyer who moved the second reading of the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill had to say for the measure. Appeals are actually pressing for decision, with no prospect of one - under two- years in existing circumstances. The necessity is so urgent that there is no time to consider. Should the House of Commons insist on taking its time over the question, and dealing with it at all in proportion to its gravity, there is no knowing how long it may be in the process, and how much private inconvenience that delay will occasion. It is true, the AxTToRNmY-Gm,-,muL observes, the appellate juriUdiction is not essential to the usefulness or dignity of the lIouse of Lords. It i6 true that the Peers are not the more respected for pretending to do in a body what they dare not attempt' to do individually, and what is done, not 'oy the body, but by two or three legal 'Peers. It is true that, as Lord WxNsrLsv&DA justly coMplains in his petition to the House, and as the AT-roP.NB:-GERnaL admits, the present bill, in the opinion of many lawyers, extinguishes for ever a dormant, but, stiU living and very usefuL branch of the Royal prerogative. It is also true that the proposed Court wiUl, after all, be very insufficient, and even precarious in the numbers and also in the quality of its members. AU this and a great deal more is admitted freely and spontaneously by the ATrronNEY-GmEnAL. He is quite anxious to let everybody know that the bill is no child of 'his, -and that he won't be answeralble for its inevitable failure. lBut " somethinag must' be done," and what elze can bhe. done I Those LDrds Will not give up their appellate jurisdiction. They will neither exercise it themselves nor'1 perniit any, others to exercise it ; so, as " something must be done," and nothing else is possible, 'weare,driven to this ;'and the ATTonmy-GNsqRi quits the painful subject I ith a ruiet hint that we ame all in a mess, and must get out of it if we cai. SiNDBAD the Sailor, while groping about in tile dark, came upon-a fox, and, rightly concludiiig that as the animal, came in so it would g oit, laid hold of its tail, and, under its guidance, got -at last to light and'day. We are all in the dark -on this subject, but here is " something." It contains at least the germ of improvement. If we put out our hands ani lay hold of it, by some tortuous process it may extricate us from. our difficulties. Whether it will be then of much value is another question. But, whatever the cogency of, the argument that "something must be done," we doubt if it was ever before applied to so extensive and multifarious a mleasure. In this instance,' because " something "c must be done," many things are to be attempted on the plea of that single necessity. The remedyattempted by .HI. 'Mfnsry's Ministers 'was at least. simple, and addressed to the emergency. There was a want of law Peers in the House in sufficient number to make it a respectable Court of Appeal, aiLd accordingly a law Peer was made, with a liraitation 'which, had it been allowed, would have rendered it easy to introduce any reasonable number of lawyers vithout crowding or impoverishing the House. The present measure, onL the contrary, is so far from simple that it introduces half-adozen gratuitous innovation3. It introduces for the furst time paid Peers,--that is, Peers paid for discharging, not an office, but the ordinary duties of a Peer. lab, indeed, it be not the' ordinary duty of a Peer to assist at the hearing -of appeals, there isL an end of the clair to appellate jurisdiction. The bill then limits the creation of life Peers- to so many and no more,at least as great an innovation as the creation of one by the revival of the Royal prerogative. It then introduces the utteily new feature of the House of Lords, or a body vwth that title, sitting out of the 'session of Parliaraent, with a distribution of duties which, as wasi observed last night, might lead to some very nice questions. All these things,-the extinction of a Royal prerogative, the institution of just four life Peers, the creation of paid Peers, and the extrasessional sitting of the so-callied House of Lords,'were introduced on the solitary plea that " some" thing must be done," and the Peers will not do anything else. This is 'all the ATTomny-GuNERAL has' to say for a measure more prolific of constitutional innovations than the -widest measure of reform. Neither friend nor foe puts any faith in the finality of the measure. The ATToUNaNE-GMmnsA is of opinion that the CRowmT- may create life Peers to any number. Sir JAES GRAsAa holds that other professions besides the law have equal claims to life peerage. and pay; that the precedent once made cannot fail to be extended; and that the scheme becomes one for debauching the Peerage. Mr. RouITD5LL PArzMsn supports the second reading of the biU, being convinced that it contains the germ of the proper remedy; but he thinks it only a germ, as, in his opinion, a Court cf AppeAl consisting of' a Lord Chancellor arid two assistants with the salaries of puisne judges is decidedly 'ridiculous. When thin is the language of a supporter, and when we are told that the measure will be good for nothing unless it goes very much further, we ame at a loss to know what worse can be said by an opponent, and what prospect there -is of the measure working to anybody's satisfaction. The bill has been read a second time, with a cdivision presenting a rather striking discrepancy with the unanimous votes or the Lords. The " compromise," it is evident, has received only partial recognition in the Qommons, as many as 142 holding themselves entirely free from it, while the majority of 191 evidently contemplate some serious changes in the biU in its progress through committee. No doubt, a nmost important duty has devolved on the House of Commons. The constit-ation makes the Lower House the guardian and interpreter of the-Royal prerogative quite as much as the Upper House. It is equally the guardian of justice, and equally charged to see our judicial institutions on a proper footing. It has even more than the House of Lords the control of the finances, and the duty of watching that those finances shall not be employed against the purity of jiustice and the independence of the Legislature. It certainly has no small interest and voice in the question whether the other House shall sit when the Commons do not sit, or whether another body altogether shall sit when neither House sits, and call itself a House of Parliament. In our humble opinion, the House of Lords has presumed, we cannot say on its strength, but on its weakness, in devising and passing the present measure. We are persuaded that if it had been the more powerful body, instead of the less powerful, a bill compelling, as it were, a new form of the Peerage, with the payment of so many Peers in that form, and enabling the House to sit when the other House did not sit,, would have savoured of encroachment, and even of tyranny. We have only to imagine the Commons sending up at all an equivalent measure; and we shall perceive, that for once the jLords have been seduced intoavery innovating and even encroaching measure. The resumption of the Royal prerogative on the Wrn_-Lw.rAs Peerage was modesty itself compared 'with this bill, 'which, after all, leaves the Royal prerogative stiU a question of controversy, and creates new difficulties without removing the original one.
The United States have just celebrated the 80th anniversary of their independence. In every city and every village of the tinion the 4th of July has had its appropriate commemoration, and the jealousy of rival interests, the :hostility of rival States, the fever of business, aud the fury of party have givea place for one day to the pride and glory of'one commoD, event, in which a31 alike share, and from which they date their birth as an independent people and 'nation. The party that -assembled at Richmond on Friday gave to this .great chorus a Cisatlantic conitribition, which combined the pride.of Anericans with the congratulations of Englishmen. England .has indeed little :reason even for regret, and much less for envy.and repining, n that event. It threw a dark gloom indeed a6f te time over her political prospects, and men, even of sagacity and foresight, shrewd and experienred' statesmen, desponded at the loss, of the briglhte3' jewel:of the Crown. GnoRoEnFT. has been much blamed for the obstinacy with which he sustained .the Anierican war, but the tiuth is hoi only reflected the general political oplnion-the good political opinion of theo day. :Melancholy prophesies pervaded society. People would hlav it that the " sun of England's glory was set," and all that class of sayimg was current. The nation was oiit of heart, its day of greatnasw seemed over, and it was seriously mal;ing up its mind for the rank of a third-ratePower.. But the event has shown how little our itatesmei' of thit. day saw intQ the future. It was ilot exiCtlythleir; fault, indeed, ' for though tht'genius of WAsMWGTOIroX could rebuke these shbitsighted politicians even upon their ownl data, aund look forward to a ime when. an. overflowing homie popplation would send a witness to its. iexhaistible.' growth in the shape of 500 a-day to the American shore; and be glad of the riddance, still it was not in. the' power of man to foretell a WAr:r, an Ansxwac;ur, and a lanchester, or a CLivE, a' WARRuN EASTINoGS, and an Indian empire. But, whether these statesmen were.or were not to blame. for their narrow and gloomy views, we now see plainly enougfh that all this Was a great mistake, and that it has not -ken fulfilled in the result. The act of 17Z6 only relieved us of a charge which 'would have become in time unmanageable. Indeed, everybody must see that the American provinces must have left us sooner or later, that their perpetual conjinctiont with the'British (Cow- was against the lawvs of political nature., and that, sulclI being the case, an earlier separation was far better :than a longdelayed one. And everybody must see, 'too, that the sinking England of political prophecy at that tima was the rising England of history, and that that was thought the country's ' ermination was rather inL reality its commencemaent and birth. England, then, has little reason . to envy the tnited States their independence, -while, on the other hand, 'two great bonds of nmity-that of a common race and that of a common reigion-corinect the mother cquntry wifh its offihoot, and promote attachment, sympathy, and mutual pride. * It is lucL-y for the world that fsllow-feeling and brotlerhood do not arise froni political union alone, and from the fact that men are 3ubjects of the same Government. There is besides the sympathy of fellow-citizenship, the sympathy of race, which is a very deep and powerful element in the constitution of mankind.. If Germans, while they live tnder a hundred different Governments, can stiUl look upon themselves as the same people, and derive an enthusiastic sense of brotherhood from a unity of blood; and if Slavonians, under Austrian and under Russian government, can set up, as they are doing now, the cry of Panslavism, . Anglo-Saxons surelv must be wanting to themselves if they make no bond of communion of their common birth and parentage. We Englishmen, then, see in Amnerican energy,. industry, and indomitable spinit the tokens of the Anglo-Samo-a blood, and we feel proud of our race. The sight inspire; chaerful and animated prophecy, and we see in this master race a powerful and a dominant agent in the future history of the world. We see that this race has a destiny, that it does not seem to die out* after it has done some great acts, as other races have done, but to possess an inexhaustible life, that it spreads, and covers the earth, and that wherever it goes it conquers nature, establishes law, and imparts the blessings of peace, order, and civil liberty. Doubtless it is for no nation or raceto boast, for the " jealous divinity" of even Pagan religion punished the boaster. Indeed, the boaster punishes himself, and soon falls in the natural order of things, for this reason-that the boasting spirit is an idle one. The Monarch who looked from his walls and said, " Is not this' great ]Babylon that I "have built ?" was a true boaster; he thought he had done enough; he was satisfied with his work, and he abandoned himself to the repose of a perfect self-complacency, unruffled by action. But the Anglo-Saxon is industrious, and genuine industry does not boast, because it has not time, and because the industrious spirit looks to the future; the boastful one to the past. A common religion, again, is another great bond of union and sympathy between the two countries. The English Protestant cannobt in his religious map afford to leave out that large and -wide field of religion which the United States present- I a field in which he sees the action not of a cold or sceptical or rationalistic faith, but of a simple and enthusiastic one like his own. Re sees this religion split,. indeed, into different sects, as it is with as; but he sees it at the same time not deadened or become indifferentist, but showing, with whatever extravagances or defects, all the signs of warmth, fervour, and life which English Protestantism exhibits. Whether we look to race, then, or whether we look to religion, we see in the American a natural ally and brother, for Twhose welfare and success we wish on interested principles, because we wish well to our race and our religion. We see in him a fellow-workman in the future history of the world-one hvho will carry out the same general ends that we shall, influence the world alike, and give to human society, so far as it comes within our grasp, the same mould and impression. We cannot afford, then, to quarrel with each other; no-a high self-interest and a lawful pride, the pride of moral influence, and the charm of historical destiny and success, are against it. One word on a subject which came up at the meeting at Richmond. We observe that two speakers there, of 'whom one was the American Ilinister, allude to the press in this country, the great influence of which upon American feeling they allow, but which they do not think is always exerted in a proper and considerate spirit. Now, it must be owned that English travellers who have gone over to the United States for the purpose of bookmaling have not been alwvays fair. They have exaggerated American defects, political and social, and their motive has been too evidently often rather amusement than truth-the amusement of the English reading public. But we are not aw-are that the political press in this country has offended in this way. Speaking for ourselves, we have always endeavoured to do justice to American: claims, and, have advised all concession short of actual abandonreent of our ownlawful rights. TheEnglish public is doubtless apt at times to give itself the liberty of the father or elder brother in its comments on the younger nation. But it must be remembered that this is not done in auy really hostile spirit. The truth is that we are very indifferent to criticism ourselves, and we are apt to think that other people are equally so. There is nothing which amuses an Englishman so much as to see himself taLen off.I Re goes to the most malicious farces on the Paris stage, 'and laughs heartily at himself and the figure he cuts in them. We do not understand other' people being thin-skinned; and make remslts which-we do not intend to'be biting, but-wnich do bite the tender subject of them. teneral CAx- WsAADER confesses that his countrymen are too sensitive. T1 :s. no egav fault, perhaps ; it .is rather the ni awl tiefect of a newer nation. Hortsernttive, -re yowlg people in society t o any yenirS:e 'upopL them I Row. red they turn, how ugry, how Qslky!' Row it preys upon them in. seciea-! How, revengeful they feel to the cool and unconscidus critic I But let a' few years 1ass over their heads, and how quietly they will take such things! -The American is the younger people, and is now in the sensitive stage' of national existence. But he will get older in tine, and know better than to take every light -weod that is said on this side of the Atlantio in such' deadly earnest.
In every coniuunity- the difficulty of raising j mn.ey for the public service has been proportioned I to ihe popular relictanuce to pay. There is a very I smCll percentage of. any population which would be unwilling to profit by the institutions of their .coutry,whilo there ia a very large Ipercentag which would: be very * rongly disposed to -withLold pyment for therm.' It is this natural'rwaywardness of the huiran race -whih has tasked every financier fri CoLErT tOTLLAi FITT, and fromr Wi,- ra&m PITT to Sir C. LIyws, and which will continue to-fask'the ingenuity not only of ChancelUors of the Exchequer, but oi. those theoretical disquisitiorts who draw up- schemes of national revenue which are beautifuilly plausible until tested by the cru'ible of experience. Sometiines it drives them to iadirect, -then, urges them back to direct taxationsonetimes it suggests imports, aud sometimes exports, for its fiscal experiment; then, when they are tired both-of exports and imports, it sends them back to property and income. But in none, of these does the subject of their visitations justify the accuracy of the phraseology which defines him to be a taxpaying animal. Ee kicks against them all with. equal vigour, if .not with equal'susccess. His devices for eluding tiiem are as ingenious as they are numerous. The taxation which feeds upon his imports fetterss commerce; that upon exports IOlls it; and that mode of impost which to the official mind wears the twofold charm of simplicity and. faeility only serves to enhance in him the desire, while it multiplies the means, of evasion. - We sluppose that no one ever- believed that the Income-tax would be strictly and justly paid. If the Governments which imposed it and continued it entertained this b8lief, they must either have been very credulous, or have resolved on being very strict in enforcing the collection.. The credulity has probably ceased long ago, and the strictness never began-at least it -was never exhibited in such a way as tDo fulfil its own purpose; and, doubtless, it was this fear of public odium which prevented the strict enforcement - of the law, and permitted a compromise between a nominal impartiality and a practical remissness of collection. Had it been otherwise, the cry which at the commencemnent ofthe tax was so justly levelled at its inquisitorial character woulcd have been renewed with intensity, and probably would not. have terminated except with the abrogation of the impost itself. But, whatever may be the reason, there can be no doubt of the fact. The Income-tax is not paid by a very large proportion of those personswhno by law are amenable to its provisions, or in the degree to which they are amenable. The returns just called for by M1r. MovrFrA= give us the following particulars, among others .-Out of more than 261,000 persons in England charged during the year 1855 ander schedule D nearly 22,000 professed to have incomes under 100l. a-year; nearly 120,000 under 1501. a-year; nearly, 42,000 under 2001. ; and 33,000 under 3001.| That is, out of about 2G2,000 persons engaged in different trades, professions, and occupations, more than 21S,000 professed to have incomes ranging from lessthan 1001. to-less than 3001. per anmum. In other words, the church, the law, physic, mercantile business, banking business, and trades of every kind throughout England and Wales do not, out of 261,000 persons, present more than 44,000 persons in the receipt of more than 3001. per annum. o10w, when we consider what .England is, what its annual income is, what its estimated capital is, what is the number of its cities and towns, the style of their buildings, the character of their operations, the ostensible means of their inhabitants, and then consider what 3001. per annum is, it is clear that such a return is an absolute fiction and imposture. 3001. a-year represents, what ? In London, a one-storied house' and a maid of all worl; in the country a t-wo-storied house, two maid-servants, ad a more plentiful, if not a more elegant, cuisine. According to this return, the greater part of the respectable streets and elegant suburbs in our cities should be tenanted by persons not possessing more than 3001. a-year. Putting aside London as the residence of the Court, the aristocracy, the chiefs of Government deDartments and of commerce (but not excluding its suburbs), we should - conclude that in Iiverpool, Bristol, MIanchester, Birmingham, Exeter, Newcastle, Hull, the higher classes of inhabitants I were, for the most part, not earning more than 3001. a-year. We should also infer from this I return that in those quiet, breezy suburbs, which I impart a touch of rural enjoyment to the fagged and jaded frequenter of the Exchange or the law courts-in Clapham, or Hampstead, or Dulwichthe majority of the vilas and cottages -were occupiedby tenants possessing not more than 3001. a- year ! But, how absurd, how grotesque such an inference would be, is apparent to every one who has the smallest Inowledge of the expenses of housekeeping in or near LTondon. It is clear that the occupants of such suburban residences as we have cited-of Brompton, of Chelsea, of Kensington, of St. JoLn's-wood, of Islingtong also the inhabitants of the cleaner and more quiet streets and squnres which do not aspire to the appellation of "- fashionable," and of the better portions of our country towns and cities, of our "genteel" villages andhamlets,-if they do not pay Inconie-tax on more than 3001. a-year do not pay the proportion wvhich justice to other contributors and the exigencies of the country exact from them. Who, then, do pay the tax ? First, the landedproprietors, great and smal, under schedule A; next, the occupants of land, under schedule B. KTeither of these can avoid the tax; neither can the public creditors under schedule C, . nor the public servants under schedule E. But C and E - together do not return as much as A or D singly. A, as might be expected, gives the largest return. D, notwithstanding the evasions we have quoted, gives the next in 3aagnitude. Butthis is done by an unjust distribution of the burden. The many who ought to contribute leave the bulk of their assessment upon their yoke-fellows. *While 213,000 persons in this schedule pay on the whole 1,377,0321., 1,725 other persons pay 1,0SC,1621., or only 300,0001. iess than the former, to -whom they are in the ratio of - one to 123 -! It may be that vanity comes to the rescue of the tax, and redresses the balance against the preponderance of evasion. If this be the case, it is certainly a happy effect, even if not foreseen. At anyrate, it proves that the weight and pressure of schedule D fall mainly upon a comparatively l -persons possessing large incomes, rather than on a vast number having only small or moderate - means.

FATAL ACCIDBKN! O2r THE TYiW. NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, Mo?sDAY. A melancholy abcident occur-ed about S o'clock yesterdayevening on the river Tyne, nearly opposite the shot tower of Messrs. Walker, Parker, and Co.'s miannfactory at Elaswikl, near this town. It appears that a steamboat, named the Newcastle and Blaydon, was proceeding uptheriver when it passed a Bsnall boat very heavily laden. There w.ere no less than 14 persons in the boat, men, women, and children, and from the number of people in her the gunwale was 'within a very short distance of the water. The swell caused by the action of the paddles of the steamboat broke over the bows of the sailing-boat to such an extent that the *women of the party became alarmed, and, rising quicklyr they upset the boat, and the wshole party were instantly submerged. One of the nnmber swvam ashore, and sin others w ere picked up) by William Cow per, an old scullerman-who plies betwveen Itedhaugh and Elawlick-qusay, and 'who witnessed the aceidant fErom the shore. Seven of the party sank to rise no more. There wvre in the boat Mr. and Mrs. Cohen, the former employed as a tidewaiterinthe Customs, and three of their clildren; lr. Eltringhamr, als a tide-surveyor, and his daughter.; JoThn Thomas Edward, Rice Oaldey, tide-waiter; Mr. and Mrs. lemon, ard one child; Henry Beaumont, Henry Humphrey, and Henry Handley, madingin all 14 persons. Mr. Cohen, after saving two of his children, was seen -lingimg to the boat, when he -was observed to leave it and swnm in the direction of his eldest daughter, -who was floating down the stream. He reached her, but v-as unable to rescue her, and both father and daugiter were drowsned. lrs. Cohen us picked. up by the watexmn.

FOIREIGN,INTELLITENJBZE. - - - - 7 FR.AI1CE. (FROM OUR OWN CGRFSZPO')FDRTl . : [A. portion of the fIlowing appeared in our Second edi. tioa of vesterdar :-1 PARS, Su.hDAY, JuLY 6, XJ P.M. -I alluded 10 or 12 days ago to -the runour thata private interview would take place between the Emperor Napoleon and the iEmperor of Austria iefore the return of the former to Paris; that the Xnpeior would visit the Chateau bf Arenemnberg, where hewas brought up; and that he wouldthence proeedto the Lake of Constance, on -the banka of which the expected interviewT was to take place.: The rumour wa2s decdare.d by a person of -authority to he totally devoid of foundation. I might have eted satisuied with that denial, but since then the report has assumed greater consistency,- both in Pans and elsewhere; and it is now positively affirned, by serious persons that the project has been and still is entertained. According to this 'version,.the Emperor of Austria is to find hiinsel- in the Tyrol, at no great distance from the lake, at the same time that his Imperial brother of France is on the Rhine, and that their simultaneous arrival on tle shore of the Lakeof -Constance is to bedmanaged bythe 'Kingof Wurtemberg. The meeting is to appear quite accidental,and to take place in the middle of the lake, aw as to be- completely outof the reach of journalists, Ministers, Ambassadors, and over-curions people of -that kind. I cannot aflirm whether the project will beprealized, but a belief in its existence is entertained in various quarters, and by many persons who are not usually over-credulous in such matters-. Austria i3- evidently anxious to draw closer the alliance with France as a safeguard against Italy as wellas against Russia, and the Emperor -Napoleon would feel flattered at the idea of being thus courted- by the son of, the Cuesars. I have just heard that one of the Emperor's Chamberlains has] left Paris for Bregenz to prepare a habitation for Bis Majesty. Bregenz is in the Tyrol, and on the eastern shore of the Lake of Constance. This looks a-if there were some truth in the rumour just refeiried to. On the authoritv of some of the friends of the family of Orleans, I mentioned the other day that - in addition to the letters of the Duke de eNemours, the Duke d'Aumale, and the Prince de Joinville, another communication had been received from the Princess Clementixe, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg, in which the allowance of 200,000f. was rejected with "indescribable indignation" by -her Royal Highneta; and that a similar communication was expected from the Duke de Montpensier. People who looked for unanimity on this subject on the part of the descendants of Louis Philippe were a little sirprised at the delay in the publication of these protests. The letter of Lthe Princess has at last made i;s appearance, and though it is to a certain degree a ;' protest," yet I cannot detect any refusal of the money. It is addressed to M. Bocher, the agent of-the family, and is as followFs. cI learn from the newspapers, Sir, that the Emperor has just proposed to the Legislative Body to vote a sum of 600,000f. Rente for the children of the Princesses, daughters of Louis Philippe. I lose no time in declaring that the. Prince, my husband, .and myself, have made -no com.. promise with the Covernment of Louis Napoleon, have claimed no favour, no indemnification. Since the decrees of the 22d of J>anuary, which despoiled my brothers, the children of my sisters, and myself, of the heritage of, my fathers, I have taken every opportunity of protesting against tht violation of my rights. I have claimed theproparty which was guaranteed to, me by my marriage contract, the property which had been left to me by the King, my well; beloved father. I asked for justice: I demand it stilL. , Believe, &c., " CLEMOENINE D'ORLEA.S, DachessofSaxe. - - -Coburg." It may be inferred, I think, from the preceding, that the Princess Clementine does not entirely refuse the money. If she accept it,- it is, of course, only as an instalment of what is her right; but her letter-to If, Bocher is certainly far from what vre were ledl to expect. by the- friends of -the farnily. These friends also declared that- the DukLe do [Brabant, as the-son of the-eldest -daughter of Laouis Philippe, wouldalso protest and express the same "indionation" at the insults offered him as the Duke do Kemours and his brothers, (who, however1 were not offered any money,)but the expected docunment has not yet made its appearance, and people begin to apprehend that the son of King Leopold may pocket the affront and the money.- The friends of the Duke de Montpensier are anxiously looking out for his protest also, which they do not doubt wil be quite as energetic as that of his brothers.- He has been offered no money. - The Princess Clementine -says that it was only from the newspapers that she heard of the project of law being presented to the Legislative Body. With great respect, I have some reason to believe that her' Royal [ighness's memory is at fault, and that she was informed long before of the intentionof the Emperor to repair in partthewrong done her family by the ilegal and arbitrary abrogation of the law of- 1830. She might have heard of it from her brother-in-law, the King of the Belo gians; her nephew, the -Duke de Brabant; her brothers, 'who in their -letter, of the 25th ult. say they had known it for some time; or, in fact, from more than one of the confidential friends of the family in Paris or at Brussels. Some of the ex-Eu.- sionists seem offended that the Princess should make use of the iword " Emperor" in her letter. Bdonsieur Bonaparte" is the utmost courtesy, fhe1 will alloW. Lord Howden, the English Ambassador inSpain, has arrived at Baayonne. Thee Duke of Alba passed:through Bayonne on the 3d inst., on his way from Paris toMadrid. - A despatch from the Captain-General of Barcelona denies the rumour of disturbances having taken place in that city. The Captain-General declares that he is not apprehensive of any. serious dis'turbances in Catalonia. The Monilinr de tArnme publishes the offcial returns of- the casualties sustained by the French army in the East from- -the first landing of the troops in Turkey on the 1st May, 1854, to the 30th MIarch, 1856, the date - of the conclusion of peace. These returns include-both the men who died from illness and who tell in the field. Their number amounted to 62,492-namnely,- officers of all ranks, 1,284; non-commissioned officers and corporals, 4,403 ; and soldiers, 5S,805. The Imperial Guard lost 2,194 killed, one-half of whom belQnged to the, 1st and-2d Voltigeurs The -Artillery- consisting of batteries supplied by the 17 regiments, had 5,06S dead; the 12 battalio2n of Foot Chasseurs, .4t426; the three regiments of Zouaves, 2,734; the two regimnents of the Foreign Legion, 1,853; the Agerian Riflemen, 307 ; the Engineers, 820; and the 12 regiments of Cavalry, 1,5T - The remainingmasualties beWell the 50 'regmenti of Iiinftry. of' thd Lliin.

Finance made a considerable reduction in -the .im. - prt duty on iron, yarn, colonial produce, &c., andwhen he did so.the organs of the Prussian Governiment unanimously condemned the measure. *-The Astrian public is still -at a' loss to anderstand how it happened that a liberal measure could. give offence, -to. such ahighly civilized andliberalGovernment.as. that' of His Majesty the Kixig of Prussia, but.it'is~ by no means difficult to explain wvhy the condiit of the Aulstrian Mtinister wraa distasteful to the Berlin Cabinet. In.the lastparaoraph of tlie Treaty of- Commerce which Was coticluded ketween Austria, and Prussia in February,18'3,itwassaidthlatbefpre, the treaty. was at an end the two Governments would enter into 'negotiations for establishing a reguilar Customns Union between Austria and- tha German Zollverein. Some time since the Imperial Government intimated to-the Prussian- Cabinet.that -it was time.to enter. into preliminary negotiations_on the above-mentioned subject, but the latter pro - fessed not-to-be-of the same opinion. Baron Bruok -more than-once returned to the charge, but with''ib better success than at first. As theu Auistrian: Minister eventually became aware that the BerHn Cabinet was inclined to, postpone the matter sine die; he resolved to act as -if iPrussia had not-been -con-. sbulted, and without loss of time made the changes in the Austrian tariff above alluded to. As a- consequence of 'the reductio6nsmade, the Austrian duntis on some important articles of commerce were lowerthan those of the Zollverein, and'excessively wroth were the Prussians tb:t such was the-case. : - I i Within the -last few, days it. has been satisfactorily proved that there. is no dearth of capital ih this city. On the 23d of. June the shares in the- Vienna-Salzburg -Railroad were issued, andalmost the whole. of the -first iistalient- of-30 per cent. has already been paid into the hands-- of the Credit - Bank-, which, acts as the agent. of the company,. The Credit Bank some tune. ago announced that it was willing to advance 20 per. cent. on the shares on which 30 per cent. had- been paid, but up to yesterday evening no application for pecuniary assistance. had been made, although ithe interest demanded -by the establishment is but 4 per cent. On asking,some.of the first money-changers for an explanation of the -phenomenon, 1' learned that by far the greater part of the shares of the Elizabeth (Vienna-Salzburg) and TheissRailxoads are in the hands of private individuals, - who consider them a good and safe in. vestment. The fouinders of the Galician Railroad company talk of pledging themselves not to let anLy one have shares who will not promise to keep his shares out of the market for one year from thettime of the payment of ithe first instalment of 30 per cent. In order thatthepromise maynot be broken,all the shares are to be, deposited in the- Cxedit Bank.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Oronday, J-uly 7. The July General Quarter Sessions commenced this morning at Cierkenwell, before Mr. Pashley, Q.C., Assistant-Judge, anda bench of magistrates. There were 48 zprisoners for trial-41 charg,ed with felony, and 7 with znisdenseanour. The AssssT.A?-T-JuDGr delivered a short charge to the grand jury after they bad been sworn. John Jones; a well.dressedyoung man, pleaded "Guilty" to an indictment in which he was charged with stealing 3lb. of copper wire, the property of the Great Northern Railway Company, from a certain buildin. hlr. W. J. syx, for the prosecution, stated that the prisoner was the son of a respectable man employed in one of the dockyards, and had been a linendraper's assistant. He was noticed lurking about the company's premises, and, a great number of petty robberies having been committed, a watch was kept upon him, and he was detected in the commrission of the theft he was now charged with. The ASsIST-r-JTIGE Eentenced the prisoner to three months' hard labour. George Roberts, 26, was Comzvcted of stealing a coat of the value of 22s., the pronerty of John Hunt, and, several former convictions having been proved against him, The CouRT sentenced him to four years' penal servitude. Hannah Knox, a young married woman, was indicted for unlawfully and crelly beating and iDtreating Amelia Barrington, an infant of tender age. She pleaded " Guilty." Mr. Poland appeared for the prosecution, at the instance of the trustees of the parish of St. Leonard, ShoreditchMr. Horry for the prisoner. It seemed that the prisoner had had charge of two illegitimate children of a relation, the father of whom was abroad, and the mother dead. On the death of the mother in August last year, the prisoner toolk possession of her home, and assumed the care-of the children, although the mother had desired that if she died-they might be takesi into the workhouse. About three months after she took the chldren under her care, she got married to a tsaslor, who soon went to Australia. The eldest of the children was 14 wears of age, and had gone away no one could tell where; the other was but 5, and the prisoner had on. man occasions beaten it with great severity. One day she t it =miercifully with a bamboo cane. The matter was taken ;sp by the neighbours, and the child was taken to the workhouse, where it was examined by the surgeon, who found the remains of a nuaberof bruises, from which it was evident that great cruelty had been used. The prisoner urged that she was the worse for drink when she used the cane, and that the child was very obstinate and addicted to telling lies. She took to the children out of kdndness, but the elder ran away; and, as to the other, she had been a mother to it. The AssssrNT-JUoGa, having carefully reviewed the - whole of the circumstances, sentenced the prisoner to eight mouths hard labour, characterizing her conduct as savage nnd cruel in the extreme. George Tasker, 13, and John Sulivan, 13, were indicted foretai- 24 pounds of lead, the property of the Great Nlorthern R~ailway Company, from their premises at King'scross, and John Jackson, 14, was indicted for being an accessory to such felony before tho fact. The two first-named pleaded " Guilty," and the other -was found Guily. The ASS-STANT-JuGE sentenced them each to 2 years' hard labour, with the view of their being sent to the Refermsatory at RehilL Mary Ann Green, 1g, was indicted for having stolen a watch from thoperson of James William Nicholson. Mfr. Poland appeared for the prisoner. The prosecutor, one evening, had -been spending a few hours at the Mogul Tavern, Drary-lane, and on his way home he was accosted at King's-cross by the prisoner, a giLlof the town. He desired her to leave him, but she followed him to llexican-terrace,Caledonian-rdad, when shesnatchea his watch. He seized her, but no sooner had he done so ihau she throw herself on the gronnd, screamed out, - and sthrea men ran up and knocked him down. She gave one of them the watch, and they ran off. A policeman came sip s;d prosecutor gave her in charge. The jury found her Guilty, and a former conviction was pzlvEd aeinsther. -- $olllnten, four bers' penal servitude.
POLICE;N. V V rGuninssanL.-James Fuller, of 4, Samous-plice, Stepu4y, and John Robertson, of 18, St. George's-road Eist, werer charged before Sir G. CnuRoaL with attempting to pass I foTged 10.-Taote, purporting tb be a Bank of England note. WilliamHarding, of 15, Southampton-buildinga, Holborn, said, he was a commercial traiveller, and the representative in London of a. countryfirm. On Friday evenmnga man named Beckley asked hini to cash a 101.-note, and he took it to the Prince Albert beershop, Whitecross-street, as he had not sufficient money about him. He gave the note to Mr. Tovey, who went to severalplacesto try andget itchanged, but brought it back, stating it was forged. He did not knowv either of the prisoners. Cross-examined by Fuler.-He did not meet them in the City-road. He was to have no interest for getting it cashed. He said he would get it cashed for Becklev. Henry James BeCkdey, of 19, Edward-street, Shepherd'swalk, said he was a drysalter. Fuller.-That man ! He is a dealer in stolen propeort and has bought stolen property fromn me overand over Beckley continued.-He knew both the prisoners, and me' them in the City-road between 3 and 4 o'clocks on Friday, when Fuller asked him to change a IOl.-note, at the same time offering that produced. He said he had not so much about hm, but would ask a friend who would do it if he could. He accordingly applied to the last witness, who took it to thePrince Albert teershopto endeavonr tolchange it to oblige him. Ho received the note from Fuller and handed it to HYarding in the prisoners' presence. Fuller.-Did you not asL me what I would give yon if you got it changed .7-I did not.,5 Fuiler.-fid I notoffer yo 30s. and you said, "No, you must have 21. if you got it done," and that it was not worth more than St, ? Beckley.-I said nothing of the sort. I was not to have anything for doing it. )fuler-Oh, you fale swearing man! You ought to be knocked down like a bullock. Sir G. COmRoLL.-Did you ask him where he got the note from? Beckley.-I din not, Sir. le had come to me once before with a person whom I knew very well, and therefore I did not ask him any questions. He did not tell me wbere he got it from. On last Saturday week he came to my house about 6 o'clock in the morning, and said he had just come from Billingate and wanted change for a 51.-note. Fuller.-Y_s, and you went into three uawnbrokers' shops to redeem stolen watches that were pledged for 15s. each, and you offered me 31.1 s. for it, and when I wanted 41. you said, " No, that thing is not worth mnore than 31. 10s." Beckley.-It is not true what hp. says. Fller vehemeritly).-It is true. You went into tbreo shops, and I can point them out, where you offered to take out the stolen watches. (To the magistrate.) That man has bought plenty of stolen property from me, and has plenty of stolen watches in pledge now, Sir. Bckldey.-It is not so. Fuller.-Did you not offer me 31. 10s. for it, and say 41. was too much for that thing? Speak out like a man, if you are a moan. Becldey.-I did not. Fller-Ob, you false swearing man ! How can you stand there and perjure yourself so?2 Beckley further said, in answer to Robertson, thathe had not taken any part inthe transaction beyond eing in company wvith Full7er when he offered the note,. en i oe Sir G. CARBon then remanded them. Bow-sTrnE r.-Arespectably.dressedmiddle-agedwoman, named Ann Stipling, was chasged with creating a disturbance and assaulting her stepdaughter, leonora Revnolds, in St. Clement's Church durng divine service on Sunday afternoon. The complainant, it apred, had gone to church with her sister, whose two children were about to be christened. Their father (defendant's husband) had accompanied them. The defendant, who had not been asked to join the party, proceeded to the church without an invitation, and took a seat in one of the adjacent pews, having previously indulged rather freely in drink. In the middle of the service, to the utter consternation of the assembled congregation, she began abusing the two young women in a loud voice, and in very bad language. The sexton remonstrated with her in vain, and complainant, hoping to put an end to the unseemly altercation, rose from her seat with the view of leaving the church, upon which the defendant sprang wildly upon her, tore the bonnet from her head, scratched her face, and struck her several blows with her clinched fist. The beadle put her out of the church, and eventually-finding that she refused to go away-gave her into the custody of a policeman. In reply to Mr. Isaacson, the vestry-clerk, who prosecuted the charge onthe young woman's behalf by direction of the churchwardens, complainant statedthat she had not seen her stepmother before for three weeks. and had not given her the slightest provocation. Her father and defendant lived together vrer? unhappily, aud probably she was annoyed at not being asied to the chrastenang. Baker, the beadle, confirmed the statement of complainant, whobehaved very temperately on the occasion. Hehad not witnessed such a scene in church during his 14 years' service in the sitnation. The d6fendant expressed her contrition. Her hsband had left her at home with only 6d. to get her dinner, and it provoked her to be so hardly treated while he went off to church to enjy himself with his daughters. She admitted having had a 'ttle drop, but her only object in going to churce was to see after him. She could not tell what moved her to kick up a row. Mr. HALL, after commenting upon the scandalous nature of the defendant's conduct, fined her 31., or one month's imprisonment in default. John Farmer, charged with a garotte robbery in George. street, St. Giles's, at 3 o'lock on undaymorning, was comn mitted for triaL M aBOROUGoEE-STssR.-GeorgeCoopera-nd.Tohnhiuley were charged with garotting Joseph Martin, and robbing him of his watch. Joseph Martin.-I am abniciclayer, and live at 20, Rupertstreet. I was going up Rupert-street on Saturday night about 11 o'clock, when, just as I was passing George-court, I looked over my shoulder and saw the prisoners and several other men close behind me. I walked on rather briskly, when Cooper came in front of me, and said, "What are you looking at?' I replied, "I am not looking at you, and I want nothing with you." The prsoners and their companions then got round me and pushedmeagainstsomerailings, so that I could not get away. Manley struck my hat, and then called out to one of his companions, "Snap it," immediately putting his hand to my waistcoat, where my watch was. I put my hand to my wais,coat pocket and immediately missed my watch. I instantly caught hold of Cooper's hand and found that my watch was in it. Cooper, finding that he was detected, threw the watch on the ground. I picked up the watch, and, seeing a constable coming towards me, I caled to him and gave Cooper in charge. Another constable had hold of Manley. The others ran off. Police-constable Fassinge, C 73.-I saw the prisoners and some others surround the complainant and get him against the railings. I went up, and the complainant gave Cooper into custody for stealing his watch. Another constable took Manley, and, when going to the station-house, Manley called out, "Rough it, George," upon which both prisoners became very violent, Cooper kicking me about the body. l It regnired four of Us to lodge bins in the station-house. I foun that the swivel of the complainant's watch was gone, and on beokiÃ¯Â¿Â½ for it in Rupert-street several hours afterIwards Ipicked it up. Theprisoners declinedmakingany defence, and werefully committed. The locality of Rupert-street appears to be infested with bad characters. This is the second charge of garotting from the same street within a week, and the place is close to the caf6 where Foschini stabbed several persons, and though 1001. reward is offered for his apprehension, he has hitherto eluded capture. WORuP-STM--WiMiam Venner, 17, apparently the son of a decent mechanic, was charged before Mr. Mv.- CORT, at the instance of the North London Railway Company, with the following wanton act. Hussey, a constable of the N division, stated, that while on duty in the fing-land-road on Saturday afternoon he saw the prisonerand three others of about the same age seated on the parapet of a bridge spanning the railway, and apparently on thelook outfor the next train. He watched their conduct for a few minuts, and then saw the prisoner jump down, and, gathering up a handfull of stones, he the next moment dropped them upon a goods train which ran under him, and on this train being directly after succeeded by a passenger-train, this was also pelted in a similar manner. He could not tell whether any of the missdles actually struck the train, as he was too far ,off to perceive the result of the throwing, but he ran across the road and succeeded in securing the prisoner, the others having effected their eseape. Mr. Payne, of the firm of Tyrrell and Rayne, solicitors to the company, stat ed that for some time past repeated complaints had been made at the various stations upon their railway of the wanton conduct of numerous mischievous people, who were in the constant practice of throwingstones and other missiles at the carriages as they ran on the line, and a week- had now scarcely elapsed since a lady passenger in one of the first-class carriages had been struck by a missile which passed clear through the window and in. jured her face seriously. It could not be too extensively known that by the 7th section of the l4thandl5thVictoria, cap. 19, the offence of casting stones or other missiles at a railway carrisagewas declared to be a felony, and the perpetrator liable, at the discretion of the judge, to transportation; and though in this; instance the company wouldnot 'wish to press the case with severity, he should yet ask for a summary adjudication under the Police Act, with such punishment as the magistrate might think proper to indict, mn the hope that an examnple or two of this kind would nut Pa sto to a practice which was at all times dangerous, and might be attended with the most serious consequences. Mfr. Huristone, the second clerk, could confim the fact just mentioned by Mr Payne, as he was a passenger by the train referred to, and seated but a short distasace firom the lady at the time she was struck. The prisoner's defence was, that it was not stones which were thrown at the carriages, and that he himself had taken no part in the act, which had been committed by his compamons, who had escaped; but Mr. lYlivucouwrT told ham there was no doubt in the case, and that, but for the leniency of the company, he should undoubtedly send it for trial. It was a most serious offence, for which he must pay a penalty of 40s., or in default be committed to the House of Correction for one maonth. SouVs,nvK-William Ludlow, a young man who exhibited a severe cut on the top of his head, was broughnt before Mr. A'BECrr, charged with committing a seious assault on Charles Lewenden, Police-constable 228 M,; while inthe execution of his duty; and William Farmer was charged with rescuing Ludlow from his custody. Sergeant Tngs of the M division here produced a certifica.te from the divisional surgeon of the Xl division, setting forth that Lewenden was suffering so severely from injurine received, that lie was unable to leave his bed." Mr. A.'BEcikrr asked what evidence there was against the prisoners? Police-constable 243 AI said, he was or. duty in Abbey. streemt on Saturday night, when he hleard cries for assist- o%e.' On proceeding ihire he perceived Leawenden, 228 M, taking hold. of Farmer, a hdohe pointed out Ludlow sshaving zLiuted him. Witnesi went up to. Ludlow to take him. into custody, when. he Attempted to ran away, but to re_vent him. doing so he took out his truncheon and struckhim: with it, and he then secuied him, and took him to the tmL tion-house in Bermondseir. - - Mr. A'Bsccr.-HaA you Ludlow in custody when you struckhim? Constable, 243 M.-I ILad not Sir I war about to take hold of hinm, though; and had i not struck him he would have got away. MIr. Solomon, for the prisoners.-How many times did. you strike Ludlow? Witness.-Only once. My orders are touse my truncheon when any one wants to get away. Mr. A'BCxET-r-I understand from you that the man I was not actually in your custody. Are you directed to'knock anf one down when they want to run away 9 Cnstable.-Yes, Sir. Mr. .A'Bcs=rr.-Fromn whom did you receive those orders? Constable.-From the commissioners, Sir. !Mr. A?BzcUsnr.-Wesu they verbal orders ? -Constable.-I don't understand. you, Sir. I did not receive myorders direct fromthemouth of the commissioner, but they are in my instruction book.. Mr. A'BECTr.-I re ly cannot believe that, as I have read the printed instractions, and there the police are requested to use great forbearance in the use of their truncheons. They are instructed particularly not to act vith any undue severity. You had not even this manin your custody. Constable.-But I was going totake him, and he would have escaped had I not shuck him down. Mr.Solomon.-IthinlX Sir, you will see, with me, that my client Ludlow has been cruelly iused. My client -has actually been nearly murclered by this constable. Constable.-My brother officer has been nearly murdered by him, and he would have got away had I not used my truncheon. Mr. Solomon.-This is a very brutal case, andI wish the whole of the circumstances thoroughly investigated, as I shall be able to show that there has been gross misconduct by the police. I.have selblom to complain of the conduct of the constables of the M division, who, as a body, are very kind and humame; but in this instance, at least, the officer had exceeded his duty Mr. A'Bs&cLrr.-t quit agreo with you, Mr. Solomon, that there should be a tho:rough investigation into the whole of this case, as I hold in my hand a doctor's certificate that a constable has been so injured as not to be able to leave his bed, and itis allegted that Ludlow inflicted the injuries, and tie other prisoner rescued him from uastody. I shall remand the prisoners until Thursday, and accept bail for their appearance. Bail was immediately lint in by Mr. Solomon, and the prisoners were liberated Unltil that day. LnAET.-WilliamT Jones, a smarb looking young man, was pelaced at the bar befere Mr. Esr,on, on a charge of hurgnarioasly breakoing into the Queen Elizabeth public. house, in Waworth-coumn on, and preparig a quantity of propertwy, belonging to Mr. Charles Ireland the landlord to be carried away.' Mr.L EI.Iaorr observed tiat it wvould be necessary to have the evidence of MIr. Ireland'Xs sister, and, to give time for3 er attendance and also to incui re into the prisoner's previous character, he should remi nd the prisoner for awveek. The prisoner w;as accordingly remanded. Mr. ELonrr requLested <n ackuowledgment of the follow. in> additional subscriptions for the poor blind man Schol. field, viz.-27. from -'V.

_ IBELAND.- - I(nmox oup OWx (OlPMONDr.T.). (BY ELEOTRIC'rELEGRE&H.1 VUBXU0iLN; MOwDAY EvTEnra. THE MASTh OF TEHE ROLlS AND-THE aL-- ATO r-B-_ GE1XILAL. At the sitting of the Bolls-Court this morning the Master made some extre-mely -pointed remarks in reference to the observation of the Irish AttorneyGeneral, at the close of Friday's[debate im the House of Commons with regard to the case of MIr. James Sadleir and the conduct- of the Irish officers. After alluding to the order maie in the. case of John Ginger anld the English shreholders, the Master of the Rolls proceeded to ask-- - "Mfay I now inquire, on the part of the public, whether rnformations have been sworn with respect to the facts disclosed in this case? If so, have any effectuai or bndfdc steps been taken to- make any of the parsties implicated amenable? Is it intended to prefer a bill of indictment at the next Clonmel Aasizes, where some of the overt acts were committed? I have reason to believe that not a copy of an affidavit or any document was obtained, by the direction of *the law advisers of the Government, of the Master's-office, or from the official manager, until on or after the 20th of June, the day I gave judgment in this case; though long prior to that date I had called attenfion to the fact that the Government had made no sign, notwithstanding the notoriety of the frauds of the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank. If the Irish Government were ignorant of all the details, it was their owm fault. If the Crown Solicitor -had been directed to communicate with me before or after I hadgiven judgment, I should have referred him to severalzfidavits and documents, and given him the dates and particulars of each. I did not obbrude advice or information privately-frst, because it was no part of my duty; and, secondly, because I believed then, and believe now, that it vould have received no attention whatever from the Government for reasons vhich tho public well know. I shalt only add that, if no b7ond ftdc proceedings be taken at the next Clonmel Assizes, the result will be that tho daty of a Privy Councillor, and the nature and meaning of the oath, will probably. meet with more discussion than the Irsh Gorernment may be aware of. His jHonour concluded by enpresnnga strong opinion against the conduct ofthe Masterin in Chancery (Murphy), who, it seems, had examined Mr. James Sadleir in his private chamber, no person being present but the official manager andNis counsel and solicitor. It could scarcely be conaidered to have been a purely voluntary examination unless Mr. James Sadleir was very strictly cautioned that it might be giveni in evidence against him, and if the examination should niot, according to the principles of law, be used directly or indirectly to his preju. dice." The observations of the Master of the Rolls were listened to with deep attention by a crowded court.

It states that the newt iron btamer Exc6lsior, Oaptaan.Keorr, juis,builtx i the Clyde, was proceeding on her finth Topge to 'Belfast havingleft Liverpool soon after midnight. Whenm off the laghthouse she came in direct coIsbomwith the Dublin Screwi Com sioncrew Te s all w as tain Bailey, the stem. fthEcsor knockn off the hagure head of the Mail, entering. her tho ne r the Fbowsprit, nad tearing its far as the foremast. Inhe forep of the Mail, under the spardeha lay a number of dechÃ¯Â¿Â½ ssenger Irieh labourers who we r coming to the haturn ngland. They lay asleep, withtheir heads cosep the ship. Five were kiled as they lay, and nina others were dreadfully mangled, one of them ing soon after the collision. Fortunately, the bulk-heads remained firmn, and the Mail, though thus cut dlown to the water'thedge kept afloat, with t hhe stem of the Excelsior so firmly imbedded in the wrock that it took lawards oa an hour ' get her free, and thenL not until the Excelsior left her anchior and earlyallher cheineable entangled amongthe broken timbers of the Mail. The Ma rshowed blo lights andsentup rockets. Two tugs proceeded to her asistance and she went into the Prhince's Iasin. The Excelsior was in charge of a pilot. The bodies of the unfortunate,- men who had been klled were removed to the dead-hous, aenl the eighLt -who were injured were taoen to the morthern Hosnital. The following iathe statement made by Captain Bafiley 1 About 2 o'cloek this (Sunday) morning the Mail, one of the Dublin Screw Company's iron steamers arrived from Dublin, and when. a short distance within-side the iock Lighthouse, end close to' the Cheshire shore, she saw the Excelsior, aso an. irn screw-steamer, outward bound for Belfast, steering towa-rdsherwvith, a light up, and about a mile distance. Seeing a collision probable, the Mail storoed her engines, ana ordered the- passengers aft, but unfor._ tnnately many of them- were asleep. Immediately afterwards the Excelsior, stem on, struck- the. -Mail on the port bow, and cut her down to the water's edge. Soma -timne elapsedi before the two vessels could be disengaged. The Mail lost -her anchor, and t-he Excelsior left -on booard the Mia%l entangled, her anchor and a quantity of chain cable.

D Zm oF TE- RiGBZr RoN. GEORGE BAFXES, MP.-We regret to announce the death of the Righ' Eon. George Bankes, ILP. 'fod Dorsetshire, wvho expired at his resdence in Old Palace-yard at I o'cloclk on Sunday afternoon. The right honr gentleman had been unwell for the last six wveeks, but it was not 7ntil :Friday last that hsis malady assesned a serious assect. Since that day, up to~ the hour of his death, the right^hon. gentleman gradually sank. Thecdeceased gentleman was second son of the late Mr. Henry Bankes formerly formnanyyears LM.P. forthe county of Dorset. Hc was educated at WYestmvinster school, and afterwards pro,eeded to Cambridge to complete his studies. He then ado pted the legal profession, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's-inn in 1813. In 1822 ho was appointed one of tho Bankruptcy Commissioners, and vas afterwards appointed Cursitor Baron, and had for many years been chairman of theaDorsetshire Sessions. He was Recorder of Weymouth. Mr. Rankes first entered on official life under the Duke of Welling-ton's Administration, when he was appointed Chief Secretary of the Board of Control, and in 1830 was appointed z Jumor Lord of the Teasury and one of the Comnussioners for the Affairs of India. On the' formation of the Earl of Derby's Government, in'March, 1852, he was appointed Judge-Advocate-Geneisa, which he held up to the resignation of Lord Derby in December the same year, The deceased entered Parliament as representative for Corfe Castle in 1816, and continued-to represent that constituency up to its being united with Warelam in 1832. At the general election in 1S1 'he was returned to the HTonse of Commons for Dorsetshire, which he has since sat for in the House of Commons. Mr. Bankes was a stremuous sopporter of the high Conservative principles, onposing the commercial measures of the late Sir Robert Pee. Mr. Bankes married Miss Nugent, only child of the late Admiral of the Fleet Sir Charles Nugent, G.C.B., who died in 1844, by whom lie leaves a- family of four sons and three daughtes FnIR 11f ~THE BL.R IAPs-ROAD;--I bsI night, about half-pasa 1lo'clock, a firebroke out on the premises. of 31r.

PBU2TCESS THEATRE. HEappy is the country," says some philosophiical reffem. ter, "t iswithout a history." Upwards of two months have elapsed since we had occasion to make mention of the, Princess's Theatre, and the reason of our silence has beera the constant success oi the Winter's Talc, which has ren. dered all vaxiation of the programme unnecessary since thm date of its production. Last night, however, the grand Shakspearian "evival," of the season having reached its 62drepresentation, VaT precedea by a little fsarco (donbtless from the French) en. titled .fusic haht Charms. Madame de la Roche (Miss C. Ieclereq), a. young widow- who is moreover the prop.ie.- tress of a fashionable Parisian lodginghouse, is happy in her approaching marriage with tL de Beauval, am. architect, and unheppy in a very troublesome English lodger, named Poppleton Pertinax (Mr. David' Fisher), who is always making complaints about his windowsandliz chinmeys. As the tiny storyprDgoresses the sentiments of the fair widow begin to change with respect to the objects of her love annd her aversion. Th- irench a rchitect turns out to be a mere selfish cal=, lauto, who has an eye to her fortune only, whilthe English grumbler is an adorer, who makes coras plamts for the sake of being continually in her presence. lt foLlows as a result of this double discovery, that the. architect is rejected and the lodger finds himself singingatt amatory duet, which leads by a natural progression to a matrimonial arangement. We may imagine, not unreasonably, that the whole piece has been contrived for the sake of this duetJ hichis su with a great deal o1 dramatic effect by 1&. D.E3her and Mims C. I*clexcq, anil which was last night honoured with a general encore. la. other resuects the piece is not remarkable.
Tim PRESS A2ID TE Pumac.-A jurv hn& awarded to Mr. Smith 4001. damages because a reporter of The '2imes made a mistake. Ifr. Smith i3 a foreman in ther house of Buckimaster; when the troops ware sent into -the Crimea, common courtesy required that our officers should. appear before the face of the enemy in proper dress; the attendance of a professor of the art was desirable, and Mr. smith shared the campaiga in the Crimea. He appears tDhave maintained a very extensive acquantsance among the officers, to whose outward mian, in fact, he must have been; asnecessaryasa medical attendant- and there is notthe, faintest whisper or the faintest shadow cast upon his. conduct as an officer and a gentleman- quite the reverse. Everybody knows also that there was in theCrimea a gentlerman who has performed tho impossibilty of addins to the fame of TeY Tincs by eendn home from day to day the most admired reports of thed bates andproceedings before SebastopoL It was the duty of 2fr. Russell, whose capital execution of his worlk has, in fact, brought his name personaDy before the public, to relate all that he witnessed or coulld learn. While reportin_ the formal proceedings, while stating the result, if any storming member of the force moved that a post be camried, or if any gallant officer of Sappers and Miners moved "that this fort do rise," he had also to bring before the British nublio the whole of the campaign, behind aswell2sin front. it was the first time that war had been carried on du rin the regular attendance of " a gentleman connected with the press ;" and in completely fulfilling the vork. which he designed for himself, Mr. Russell reported every. thing. Now, it was impossible that all this really arduoust work could be execated without mistakes, and mistakes were made. In the course of reporting camp gossip the reporter stated that " the representative of a celebrated rmlitary tallor" had fallen into a controversy vith the Provost Xarshars men, had been taken into custody, and flogged. The description could only apply to 3r. Smith. The story was a pure fabrication-The VWies repoLter ha! picked up a canard ;and itwas one that subjectedL-. Smith. to a good deal of annoyance. If not flo_ged, he was roasted: and irritated; forit happens tbattheprofession of atailor has alwaysbeen distinguishedfor its gaUantry andfor its-q.sitivenessto anyimputation on its honour. Assoon, however, asthereport could be referred to its author, and its untruth aes-r. tained, it was contradicted by The Times, with an expren. sion of regret; and thera it appears to us the matter might have stopped. NTot so; Mr. Smith was not satisfied, peoplebelieved that he had been fogged, and would not believe that he had not been flogged. We do not see, indeed, why Mr. Smith should complain of that proclivity to the worsewhich habitaally characterizes any mob. It did not alter the f.ct; it did not for a momenti deceive those who Imew the gentleman's character ; among the friends that he valued he was as before. Still, he wanted some more tangibletoken of penitence and reparation. The feeling is matural No man, except a Mtawvrorm, likes to be despised; lath not even a Jew eyes, ears, and so forth? if you tickde him, wilI he not laugh, and if you wrong him vidl he not revenge X And if that is trae of Jews, who arenotadmitted to ParTia. nieut, how can we deny it of Christians, a race of more consideration 7 So Smith demanded, not indeed a pound oE flesh, bat damages; an(d of tba' precious commodity the jury awarded not one pound bet 400L. True, the slioe is taken out of the large body of Mr. Harrhion, thea avatar of The Tiines in the Court of Common I'leas; but the wealth of tie defendant does not alter thea merit of the judgment. Thejury pleaded in extenuation C this verdict that the contradiction was neither tirnely nor sufficient. As to the tiume, no more was consumed than was necessary for reference. The reporter said that a tailor bad been fogged; Mr. Smith said that hehad not been floggeistatements not es facie incompatible; and if the tale was untrue it was necessary to ascertain the untrth. The pIesence of another tallor in the Crimea, is not so self-evident a ldiysical or motal impossibility that; it must at once be aEsumed. - The contradiction waus distinct; it declared the tale to be a fabrication, and/ thus left the honour of the gentleman who claimed to be the hero of the canard absoluitely without tarnish. But; the jury, we saspect, imtilled into their judgment three grains of prejudice. They believe that the press is bounnd always to preserve absolute accnracy, a thing which human, nature never yet attained; they believe that the press is most chiefly so bound when it speals of a tradesman, who is in the eyes of juries a sacred character, net to .be mentioned without awe arid self-restraint; and theybeleve, that there is some sort of glory in a victory over T)jc TiSnCS Now, all prejudices are fallacies, and these are three..
