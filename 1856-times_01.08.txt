The hall was completely 1fied; The sin g co-mmenced soon after f o'clock, and occtLpied,with sbortintervals,tillnearlylO. The programmecompiased selections from Helinore's and Gauntlet's Carol;, also from the S.P. CK colletion, and one or two pieosT from other sources. The masnner in which they were executed was spirited and effective, and the audience testiiet theiraipprobation by repeated rounds of appklause.

The LORD BLSoP then rose, and was most warmlygreeted He observed that, as he had been so politelyrequested to say a few words on that occasion, he could not. efrain from the pleasure of doingso, were it onlyto assrer them all, whichhe did in perfect truth and sincerity, of taea realgratification he expenenced at having that opportunityafforded him by the Fellows of that Colege of mectming in social intercourse so large a body of the inhabitars.ts of his own cathedral city. (Cneers.) It so happened. as they were aware, that from the circumstance of his reidence being situated some litle distance from the city, hea was denied the privilege which was enjoyed by some of blis brethren of the episcopacy of being brought inito more contirned contact with the citizens and of- associating with. themmore frequently, not merelyin thewayof duty_v-ss, for instance, as when he came among them to preach crpreside at meetings-but in other ways on social occasiows, which, after all, were productive of good onboth sides, ard. weich brought out a man's real genial good feelings, and. testedhisn quite as much as many of the severiMes of life. This was a great disadvantage to him; and he rejoiced nnfeignedly at that opportunity of meeting so large a body of7 the citizens-to mseet them as friends and Christian brethren, rejoicing together in that Christmas festiv-rejoicing to hearthose sweet sounds which God had permitted usto make, and rejoicing to consecrate those vocal powers to. .LS pra;se. (Hear, hear.) It was delightful to meet togetherminA everything t.hat served to kIndle and keep alive a. kindly feeling one towards another, and this kindly feeling was a Christian feeling, because oue of the great. ebjects of our Lord's redempItion was to induce all men to. feel as brethren, to forgetalllittle differences of opinion, and. all those trivial dissensions which wvere calculated to throwus in opposition one to another; and to replace them bymutual concessions and that spirit of lore.which should. niake us all feel that we are the cidren of the sine. Redeemer. (Applause.) It was, indeed,.no siall elemnent ine the satisfactionhe felt that a sort of "triplecord"wasunitedinthat assembly-namely,theunion ofthe.U l-ver y, t.he diocess, and the city. Such cords were not rdilybroken; and he trusted this one never would, but that it. would be more firmly than ever knotted in that good old Hall of Merton, audthatthe University, the diocess, andthe: city might always feel united as three inone, and one in. three. (Renewedcheering.) e Rveryheartily thanked themfor the kind way in which they had received what he ha& endeavoired to say to themn, and he also heartily thnked. their kind hosts on that occasion, not only forhimself, but. 5if they wouldyseriit him to do so) on their behalf also, forhaving entertained them in their beautiful hall, and forhaving given them an oyportunity of meeting so happily and unitedly; for, as he had said, he beliered these assemblies did a great deal towards promoting a kindly and Christian sympathy one with another, and drawing oetc those bright qualities which, like the flowers of a garden, were beautifulto behold and fragrant in odour. (Cheers.) The good old college in which they were met contributed tD' this happy result, and he therefore begged to thank theirkind hosts for having provided them with so gratifying and exceedingly appropriate an entertainment. (Prolonged. applause.) At a subsequent interval the 3fayor -was called upon to. say a few words also, and, in doing so. s WoISnP said he had great pleasure in acceding tothe request and in expressing his thanks for the very delightful evening he had had anopportunity of spending. He, was satisfied every one present would cordially join with him. (Cheers.) The entertainment providad for them was; not only very pleasing, but they had listened, he was sure, with much gratification to the noble and kidly sentimentss which had been uttered by the lord Bishop. (Renewed applause.) He could only repeat that he had spent a most delightful evening, and, though it was a common observation to make, he made it sincerely-he had never spent a more delightful one in his life. At the conclusion of the programme., which was terminated by the NationalAnthem, the company were conducted to the common-room and bursary, where refreshmnents were served, and they broke up soon afterwards We must not orait to mention in terms of commendation thevocal exertions of two of the hosts, -who, accompanied byDr. Corfe, sang two of Mendelssohn?s duets during the even. inig, in both of which they were deservedly encoredL
B3EHBAVED BwCurTON.-It is-frightful to think of the desolation of Brighton. A11 "private soirdc4" dinnerparties, balls, &a., must be suspended for want of a masterof the ceremonies to consult about the guests, and Brighton. must be hke Belgravia or Tyburnia, to say nothing of lancras, Iambeth, or Southwark, where great and little peoplec venture to choosetheircompanywithoutzecourse to a raasterof the ceremonies for a character. It is a great advantage, no doubt, for a gentleman or lady to be able to say, " r. 31aster of the Ceremonies, before I ask-to dinner, dco let mne know whether he is a thief?' Or, " Before I invite the Baron - to my ball, pray inform me whether ke it, the celebrated swindler or the disished refugee?' Anil one can easily i.ine the difficulties of the place whilethere is an aheyance of this social police. In fact, the73righton society wants the detective officer. But how is lheto be got9 Whence ishe tobehadI How can the most; fond and sanse hope he entertained that a mm so be found?s Is there on earth a fool quaiifiedI fortheplace? There axe persons enough who wouldleave, cards, and open books for gunea sub-criptions in rdtrn but the rab is, that there are not the fools to give guinea. The onefoolmay be foundforthe situatior, but he cannot make the many fools necessary to suppert it. Our Brighton contemporary, who is so fell of asietabout the i portant appointment, does not knowexactly where it rests, but he has only to turn to, the ayor of Garrat to see the constituent bodyand m.ode of electio-i. The p resent times, however, require a mew eligibility, :and the competitive prihc%kle. ought to be introduced in a preliminary eIMInanat eof candidates, so as to secure the aprriate aptitude of a. foolishness of the supreme order. - is no easy matter. An old writer said, "sthere were only seven wise men i. days of antiquity, there are now not as muany fools." t s thenthe original British fool has dwindled away, so that nowyou do not kmow where to have him. The Abono, Society was too late forhis conservation. Does &Nathaai.av :' If not, there is aohone forBrihton. It will behbencefc-- masterless, ceremoniless. It will give no dinners for . of thieves, no soirdss for fear of iapostors, no balls for of fortne-huwnters. Its great viEtois will be in c dread of little visitors in diagnise.

The flatness of the amarket in ,the iiiit-part of* the day was attributed to un-favouralble accounts-from the Paris Bourse, coupIed _'witlr- ome sales-by the Government broker and -others, advantage being at the same time tak;en of the opportunity to spread a rarietyofadverse reports.

The previous fail appears tohave been in a -great measure attributable to the Government - having announced an advance of I per cent. in the :rate- of. interest on Treasury-bonds. There were no 'quotations to-day from Vienna, owing to an inter-ruption of the telegraph.. Private advices from St. Petersburg to-day reach -to the 29th of December, and are of considerable -interest. They mention the arrival of Prince Ester'hazy, and state that the question of an ltihmatiu -was the subject of universal talk and of all kinds of :rnunours. It had been reported in high quarters that his propositions, both the m7cximU7m and mi7i-mum, were at once rejected, but this was positively erroneous, and it had been ascertained that he had niot yet even seen the Chancellor(CountNesselrode), annd was not to see him till thle following afternoon. Itwas also understood that no answer was to be given for 15 days, and it is added that a -Council of the Empire was to be appointed to exa-mine and discuss the propositions. Hence it is said, " it may be taken for granted that all reports in the meantime will be totally destitute of founds-tion." These letters confirm the disfavour with which Austria at the present time is professedly reggarded. The members of the Austrian Legation, it is observed, not having instructions from their Govern--nent, declined attending the TeDeuzm at the Palace for the fall of Kars, "and are, consequently, not received into Rusian society." All classes, even including the peasants, are represented as indulging in ivectives and sarcasms against them. Wi=th regard to trade, the activity of the overland transit -is said to have increased, and it appears that, -owing to the extraordinary number of horses employed to bring imports from the Prussian frontier, -the rate of carriage back from St. Petersburg to Kowno had fallen to 6V. per ton for hemp, flax, a-nd tallow. In consequence of the expectation that the land traffic in the spring would be -enormous, and that much higher rates will prevail when the present large importation of sugar, -cotton, dyewoods, Ac., shall have ended, the Engiish houses and capitalists in general were taking -advantage of the opportunity to forward theirgoods -as fast as possible. The Government have contracted for 3,000 tons of lead to be delivered in the -spring and throughout the summer. Its'price had -greatly faMlen, and sulphur,which was last year 501. per ton, could now be had for 30l. Thiswas owing to the undisguised facilities afforded by Prussia, and - an expectation is mentioned that such articles wiU very soon be at nearly peace prices, " as they continue to be imported without any apparent interrup--tion." Even the Russians, it is said, exprers great -astonishment at this state of tlhings, and are fearful that, being so flagrant, it may lead to a suppression -of the entire traffic next season. Indeed among some --of theprincipalmerchants the conviction isthatthere wil be peace, or a total stoppage of the overland trade this year. These persons, therefore, think it best to enter into no speculation in Russian -goods for next spring, for delivery at which time a great deal of German, although not much British, capital has been advancedto the Russians for - the supply of the English markets throughout the -summer. The rate of exchange, im consequence of -the extent of trade, was wel supported at 35 11-16d., which, itis remarked, is very littlelowerthanthatat which it has often stood in ordinary times, when, as is now also the case, the import market has been brisk. The weather was very mild, the thermo-.metet being three deg,rees above the freezing point, -nd great quantities of goods were being forwarded to Archangel in the expectation of g,etting them off before the arrival of the blockading squadron. Sub-sequently to its departure last autumn, 33 vessels got in and afterwards cleared with cargoes. Among -these were some American vessels, which had brought large supplies of arms and other munitions of war. - One ship under the American flag, it is said, remains frozen in fully laden with flax and lhnseed, ready to zsail on the breaking up of the ice for London, -elearing- out for Holland. In the Baltic, it appears that owin to the present mildness of the temperarture navig7ation has been resumed at some points, , ~smce the steamer Hebe wvas to leave Tn'-vermmde for Revel on the 30th of December, and vwould is,take goods thence for Lubeck. ,' The continental letters to-day describe an im- -provement in the exchanges. at Hamburg money had become comparatively abundant and discount -had falen to 5 per cent., with the prospect of a - futher reduction. The rate of exchauge had conisequently rallied, and bills on LondonL were very scarce. In Holland there was a simiai tendency, -and at Paris also the rate is firm notwithstanding -the scarcity of money and the- gloom on the Bourse. The reports of the *rade of the manufacturinmg -towns for the past week contain Little of interest, business having scarcely yet resumed its ordinary -coUrnse after the interruption consequent upon -Christmas and the opening of the year. At MIanchester the transactions have -been moderate at steady prices, with a fair extent of employment. In the Birmingham iron-market thereis a healthy tone, 'Which contrasts very favourably with the position of the trade at the beginning of 1855. The Nottingham advices describe no alteration. In the woollen disticts the trahsactions have been of an aveiage -character, with a tendency to improvement both in -the homne and foreign demand.

THE CORN TRADE. MARK-LANE, MONDAY AirEsNOcy, JAN. 7. The supplies last. week were moderate; those of barley and country flour being the best. The English wheat amounted to 6,203 quarters; the foreign, to 6,018 quarters, being principally from Ibrail and India. Exports, 791 quarters. This mowing's supply was short, and mostly in badcondition; such qualities still hang on hand, but dry rarcels and fine old found-a better sale at fully the previous rates, with more inquiry for foreign, which is required to work the new samples. The country flour consisted of 17,142 sacks; the foreign, of 793 sacks and 1,799 barrels. Exports, 71 sacks. Norfolks somewhat recovered WVednesday's depression, as well as American barrels, the top price of the former being 56s.; of the latter, 44s. There were -only 275 quarters of foreign barley, but the E nglish supply reached 11,668 quarters. There was a better sale for all really good qmuaities, and the lower sorts were fim, though dulL In malt no alteration. The foreignoatswere 5,525; the IrLih, 6,182; theEnglish, 3,886; in all, only 1S,603. Without any abatement in quotations the trade was very dragging and unsatisfactory. The onlyparcel of foreign beans this week- was 380 quarters from barans, the English supply being 735 quarters. Peas, also, were less abundant-viz., 360 quarters of foreign, but there were 1,049 quarters of home-growth. English beans were difficult to selL Hog peas Is. lower, white 2s. cheaper. The linseed supply was moderate-viz., 2,612 quarters; exports, 600 quarters. The rnarket was firm, demand steady, and tendency upward both for seed and cakes. Canaryseed very dull and cheaper, as wellas- rapeseed; but little doing in cloverseed, but that at full prices. In hemp and other seeds no change.

RAILWAY IN!ELLrGENCE. SHEWSBURY AND WEICHpoOL A ptibo neetmg was held on Wednesday at Montgomery in supct ofthis line of railway. MBrh. PUGJ. MP., took the chair. He denied that there was any intention of the directors of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway Company to disunite the line between Weleloal and Oswestry. He never heard that question mVooted at the board, nor did he belieme that a single director entertained the idea. He then referred to another scheme -the Rea Valley. His opinion was that their own line having tle support of lord Powis, was the best and most advantageous to the bulic. 31r. 'xey stated that the total length of the line was almles, inclding the branch to Minsterley, and the distanuce irma Welchpool to Shrewvsbury would be Eittle over thatby the present read. It would also accommodate the Rea Vlla3ey district. The Rev. M. LTiovn proposed that the wants of this town and distaict were such as to render it the imperative duty of theinbAtants topremote byeverymeansin their power an inmediske railway communication with Shrewsbury. They ihad Jmg.waned railway communication through the district, nd now they had an opportunity of getting one. The line now peoposed was calculated to afford all the accommodation tey required. lfr. BfL E. JONSs seconded the resolntion, whEich waS unanmously adopted. Mr J. P. WsaruyG moved a resolution to the effect that as the line wvas calculated to conciliate the Rea Valley interest in connexion with a Shrewsbury and Welchpool Railway, it was the opinion of the meeting that the proposal of 3lr. Piercy shoul be adopted and supported in preference to any other. Mr. IL OwIue seconded the resolution, which was carried without a dissentient. Other resolutions were then agreed to iii furtherance of the project, and a vote of thank-s to the chairman concluded the proceedings. FRENCH RAILWAY TRAFFIC. The traffic receipts for the year 1855 on the Northern of France Railway amounted to 1,974,7451, and for 1854 to 1,&83,7841., showing an imnrease over the preceding year of 390,9611., or 24-6 per cent.

i ~ ISMITH OBRIEN 1- EXJIE.* The meditatios of exiles are frequbtlY piquant, though they may have renounced for es-er the illusions which banished them. If they si%-1pY tend their wounds like 'hiloctetes or gatherj)leasant consolations like M6, their situation, with it contrasts, is not-without interest. The meditati-gs, 12oWever, which they sometimes present us ams :Ot always those which we should prefer to enterWin The world, greedy of personal particulars, word doubtle3s have desired a history of the last Irish bmneutl from William Smith O'Brine; but. instead of grtifying its curiosity with the secret history of that lively conspiracy, it is condemnes6 to a philosophical disquisition on the true princi*ies of' government. If Mr. Smith O'Brien had his option, he woald, Le says, have undertaken to write a histcry d Ireland; and, candidly, we must confess wb *Lould have preferred him on- that topic. But, not; laing access to the requisite materials, he was cc4pelled to generalizehis ideas, and "to write as a dtizen of the world rather than as an-Irish p&triot" In the latter capacity we can have no okjeeion to him, except that his subject is of that abstract quality that it is only here and there that he is able to illustrate it l'y his personal experiences. He fitizy insists 'that he has had opportunities of obwevaton in political afairs of a more varied kind than ordinarily fall to the lot-of his fellow-Britons. If something besides opportunities is wanted to impart novelty to a subject on which sages without number, domestic and foreign, have laboured, we must do Mr. O'Brien the justice to let him state his advantages and what he conceives to be the scope of his teatise:-. - "I have been a member of the Britbh Paflament durig 18 years. I hare taken a partinthemostperfectlyorganized, if nDtthe most formidable, 'agitatiot'that is known to recent history. As an Irish country gentleman, I have been engaged during many years in the details of locl administration, while performing tho duties of grAnd Juror, trate, guardian of the poor, and in discharge ofoth similar functions. Ihave been associated with many volunnary societies, both in England and Irelaud, founded for the propagation of knowledge and for the advancement of socla progras. I have undergone imprisonment of various degrees during a qeriod of six years; and, as a transported conxict, I have -wtnessed not only many different forms of penal discipline, but also many of the earliest processes of colonzation. Under these circumstances, it occurred to me that I oQuld not employ my time more usefuly than in endeavnring to frame a synoptical view of society,.and to deivlape in a summary manner principles of organization, legisotion, and administration which are generally applicabde to all free States, whatever may be the peculiar tendencies of their population. " Iam very far from imagining that I have given a true and satisfactory solution to all the problems which I huve placed before my readers. If I have been taught nothing elsoebyt'heexperience of mypastlife,Ihave at least learnt froi t to distrust my ownjudgment. I bave had reason to change several opinions which I fonnerly entertained; and with respect to some of the questions discussed in these pages, f.he arguments are sonicelybalancedthat I-have sometimes found get difiiculty in my ovm mind in deducing fromi thes a peremptory conclusion. This work is intended to boe ugestlave not dogmaticaL. I invite the political Ltudent to discss with me a .series of questions which present the2nselves for solution in the management of publc affairs, and, after placing before him the considerations 'hich have influenced my own judgment, I leave him to draw hisown deductios. In regardto a few fundamental prncps'es, the dictates of natural justice appear to me tobe plain, explicit, irrefragable; bult in the great majority of the cases the decision of the inquirer must depend upon the pre,onderating weight of argumentsvwhich counterbalance " This task has been brought to a conclusion during my residence in Belgium; and it has been highly satisfactory to me to find that many of the suggestions which I brorght forward as theoretical ideas while niting at the Antipodes have been benefcially realized in the actual administration of the public affairs of this country." The titles of some of his chapters, which we will take at random, will give an idea of the description of work he has produced. Chapterlison the origin of different kinds of government; chapter 6 on the organization of a government; chapter 12 on the Executive; chapter 17 on police. There are chapters on public wrorks, poor lawvs, education, finance, naval and military airs, trade and commerce, and on colonial affaidrs. hID the last only do we find any peculiar traces of Mr. O'Brien's experience, and as no man, not even r. O'Brien with his vicissitudes, can enlighten us upon all, to the last we shall confine ourselves. The countries of Western Europe, he remarks by way of preliininary, have alone established distant colonies. They possess a seaboard and a redundant population in common vith other countries-those of Asia, for example; but their energy and enterprising spirit alone have led them to appropriate the waste places of the earth. Mr. O'Brien designates this spirit as "self-aggrandizing" when he seeks to raise a question as to the propriety of its exercise, and to iisinuate a charoe against Great Britain as the principal culprit. 'Tithi the last two centuries (thus he states the case) natives of the British isles, or their descendants, have acquired the sohole of North Ame-ica, the whole of South Africa, the whole of Austirlasia (including New Zealand), and-a large portion of the most populous and productive regions of Asia. Observn the exaggeration of geographical limits, we object still more to the form of the question "whether it be reasonable that one nutfOm should thus monopolize so large a portion of the globe." The term "natioiP' ishere substitutedfor "race," because it is only as a nation that Mir. O'Brien can comprehend all vagrant Saxonis, and bring_:them- before the tribunal he has in contemplation; a&efurther, '^ cause. "nation," distinguished as British rather than Americau, enables him to make Great Britain not only answerable for her own sins, if sins they are, but the scapegoat for American and even Celtic transgressions. "The continental Powers," he intimates, "might without impropriety hold a congress on the subject of her pretensions," but not, we suggest, on such a wide indictment as that preferTed by Mr. O'Brien. Nor do -we see -what reason the coftinental Powers have for taldng up the question at all rather than the races of Asia or the tribes of Africa, nor why these lattershouldbepreferred to the wolves and the bisons, unless there were some law, which Mlr. O'Brien has not taken account of, which each obeys in turn and in different degrees, and which law is part of the moral providence of the universe. Mr. O'Brien either urges too much or too little-too much to convict Britain alone, or too little to exonerate the rest of mankind. The foundations of his Piinciipges fs Gorcrnment reflect, as far as they can, a little of his former ultra-Irish obliquity. When he comes to their practical development his individual sagacity counteracts the influence of partisan wrongheadedness. He has had experience of some of our most advancing colonies, and has learnt the views of colonial reformers; moreover, he has turned his experience and his learning to a practical account. He differs at the outset from some of our modern lights who think the retention of our colonies unimportant.- - " It is, indeed, contended by some wniters of authority that it is a nmtter of indifference to the mother country whether her emigrants establish themselves in a foreign country or in a colony. By these writers it is a-ued that the independence of the United States has, upo he whole% been more usefelto Great Britain than wo-ld have been their retention in a state of colouiil subjection. While I admit that the independGnce of a colony i mnore advantageous to the mother country than its retention as a misgoverned and discontented dependency, I cannot but thinkr that for the mother country, if not for tlhe colonies then, selves, the maintenance of an intimate connexion is -me advantageous, if they be well governed, than separation. A s,pirit of commercial rivalry and of pchitical antagonism, which has sometimes amounted to aetia hostility, exists between the UJnited States of America and Great Bt British manufactures have -been subjorted to heavy &fties, levied for the-protection of the domestic industry of America. In regard of general policy, the publc -iiil oE America no's only does not receive an impress3 f-rona tho mother country, but, on the contrary, is ofteain direct opposition to it; and, instead oR identity of sosienta there prevails theiacerbity of contradiction.

LONDON TuESDAY JANUARY, J8, 1850. Will Russia accept the terms ofered to her by the allies? They reached her on the 2Sth of last month, and as yet the telegraph records kothing. She has neither thrown the messenger ZnBo a well, as the ancient G7rees did the enasMaries of--the Great King whon they came to aeniand from them earth and water, nor run him wp to the yardaxm of one of those rirgates which, though secluded from the eea, may yet perform i(differently' well the functions of a gallows, *or dismissed him without an answer. Ru!ais is silent, and we preswTne, therefore, is reditating, and in the interests of peace {ho -*ore profoun'dIy those inl-ruafted with her destiVies meditate the better. We canno, indeed, aipect that she will ¼irry herzelf to gratify our impatience. She h&3 our Eecret, and imay tasuobly take her timne before she inmparts to - hers. A simple " No" w6td have blen soon mwl and the fact that it has nte beet utte-od far1 bps is aow. proof that '" No"' doenot fly so readily to her lips as her English admircrs and supporters would have led us to suspect. Doubtless her waV (iI|muafi4t§ te -turning over ana over the, propositions of the allies. and seeking for a soft place on which they mnay hang an assent, a. negotiation, and then a refusal. At any rate, we can wait, for we are in the position of a chessplayer who has got the best of the game, and ought not to rap the board with his knuckles if his artagonist be rather long in choosing between the embarrassments which are set before him. Russia has, indeed, much to consider. WVe are now begbinning to see and she to feel something of those effects which the fall of Sebastopol was sure, sooner or later, to produce. There is a perceptible alteration in the attitude of the smaller States of Europe. The Scandinavian kingdoms have taken a decided step in advance by entering into the alliance of the allies, who are the avowed enemies of Russia. What is raore extraordinary still, those States that appeared to be the most entirely under the control of the modem 31acedon-Saxony, Bavaria, and Wurtemberg-are faltering in their allegiance, and, true to the principle of being strong upon the stronger side, are afilicted with doubts wheathler their side be not now the weaker. The great passive and inert bulk of Germany is bestirring itself in a lumbering and hesitatina manner; visions of national unity, of merging individual interests in a truly German policy, of substituting patriotism for individualism, and many abstruse logical entities for many others equally abstruse, flit before the German mind, shadowed forth ir. pamphlets of pages. innumerable and sentences interminable, and the duty of considering whether something having some remote relation to concerted action ought not to be considered of is enforced with the subtlest dialectics ard most recondite terminology of K-iT and HA-.EL. Germany, if not whoily awake, is certaiinly not entirely asleep; if a little fuddled, is not entirely inebriated; if a little giddy with tobacco-smoke, is not wholly stupefied; and is, indeed, gradually awaking to the conviction tha-t she has talked and written rather too much, and done and adventured rather too little. The Russianw mind has never evinced much proneness to metaphysics, but enough is 'disclosed to occasion some anxiety as to the permanence of an influence which, 'ntil the war came, she believed to be indestructible. Nor is ib easy to say what effect these symptoms of incipient mutiny may have upon the. counsels of hustria and of Prussia. To Austria such an awakening of the public mind is no inconsiderable encouragement to advance in the course on whicl she has just entered, since it not only promises to her that support for which she has so long been seeking, but gives an earnest that, far as her policy has fallen snort of her duties and her obligations, it has stiU been of some advantage to her, in comparison with the far less excusable tactics of her rival, Prussia. The Court of Berlin, on the other hand, seerms to be threatened not only with a descent from the position of a great Power, but wiith complete isolation from those States the support of which she has with so much crooked policy been courting. These things must tend to convince the one Germ-an Power that it has been friendly over much to the CzAR, and the other that safety and ambition alike point to a coiuso of more decided hostility. The work of 40 years of intrigue is being rapidly undone, and a further continuance of the war bids fair to uproot an influence in Germany which 40 years of like iatrigue and corruption may not restore. Yet We cannot bring ourselves to believe that the Emperor of Russra, though he hesitates to refuse, will make up his mmid to accept the terms offered lim by the allies. In the interior of his kingdom the German party, usually regarded as the friends of peace, has been prostrated, and the Old Russians, the implacable advocates of war and conquest, reign in their stead. Out of Russia the Belgian organ of the CZAR keeps-up bravely the note of defiance, and challenges the allies to try the for'tue of a campaign in the nolth. With gre.at ability, and with not more unfairness and effrontery than the exigencies of a rather umanageable case demand, this journal strives to c-eate dissension between England and France, and to prove to both that any hope of a success in the Baltic is utterly futile and absurd. To I be sure, it a little over-argues its case when it states that the Baltic is only open four months; but there is no doubt there is great justice in whal it says wvith reference to the impossibility of wintering ir. those inlospitable regions. Since tie tinle of CRARLEs I. no enenmy's army has wintered in the dreary confines of Russia, and the success of that experiment was not so great as to induce its repetition; but when the Nord tells us that we can only scrateh the feet or pull the hair of Russia its metaphors carry it a little too far. Our scratches have drained the arteries of the giant, and, though applied at the extremities, have been only the more effective on that account. VWe anticipate, then, from Russia neither a refusal nor an acceptance, but such a modified counter-proposition as may give rise to negotiations, and enable her to play off upon uis the devices of another mystification and another conference. Unless there be a broad and clear acceptance of every main point-unless the proposal relate only to matters of secondary importance, and such as miight fairly and reasonably form matter of difference %etween negotiators agreed on e3sentials, we trust that suich insidious overtures will be peromptarily refused. On the conduct of our own Government we have no doubt, and as little of the course which a sense of his own dignity and interest wMil induce the Emperor of the FRnscH to pursue. It must, indeed, be abundantly evident that it is absolutely requisite for the very existence of our Government that it should meet Parliament with a decided announcement of peace or war. In announcing either Go-ernment may reasonably expect the support of the nation, but a repetition of the uncertainty of last April the House and country cannot and wvil not tolerate. War to be successful must be carried on not only with the assent, but with the enthusiasm of the people, and enthusiasm cannot be maintained if we are perpetually halting in mid career, and teaching our friends and enemies alike to believe that we are unequal in spirit, if not in strength, to the task we have undertaken. Tt were presumptuous to speculate as to whether it be for the ultimate benefit of Europe and the world tlat peace should now be concluded It may be that an immediate cessation from toil and -danger may be dearly purchased by giving Russia breathing time ere her strength be thoroughly exhausted; but we cannot belwreng in thinkdng that, whatever be the merits of either alternative, the course that halts between the two 'is fraught with mischief and disaster.' ,/
Our correspondent at Constantinople, in the letter whiech we publish to-day, gives some interesting particulars of the heroic defence of Kars, which, if possible, increase our regret that its brave ganison ancd its noble leaders did not meet a more woithy fate. Leaving, however, what is now, unhappily, beyond recall, we may with more advantage consider the nature of the country which must one day-be the seene of a stubbom contest and the prospects of the next campaign. The Russians miy be loolied.upon as holding a long line of positions in defefice of their Asiatic provinces. Their extiie Wv is now strengthened by the captuir of the Turkish fortress, and the comn7al of a great, eixtent of country to the w-est and north. Their right rests upon the spurs of the Caucasus, -which strike off southward from the great clhain, and merge into the Armenian district of m6untains. The Suramin Pass, which defends Tiflis and the, valley of the Cyrus, is the most important position in this part of their line, while before it, at a distance of some T0 miles, is Kutais, which will probably be strongly fortified long before the aLlies are in a condition to invest it. Between Kutais and Kars is the pashalic of AAkhaltzik-, a region of wood and mountain, thinly peopled and ill suited to be the theatre of offensive warfare. It almost follows as a necessity that an alied army operating for the conquest of Transcaucasia should attack the Russians at one of the two extreme points, with a view either to the reduction of Gumri or to a direct march on Tiflis. With respect to a campaign in 4rnenia for the recapture of Kars there are strong reasonts for hesitation. All that before told against the Russians is now in their favour. They are on the defensive ; they hold not only Kars, but the Soghanli Mountain, across which the road from Erzeroum pasies at a height of 4,000 feet above the sea. From a mere glance at the map one is apt to inquire why Erzerotun should always 'be spoken of aa on the road from Kars to the sea; It stands to the south-west of the captured fortress, is equally inland, and far away from the Russiaii frontier and the parts where the war is carried on. But it must be observed that in that Alpine region the nearest way is often closed by insurmountable obstacles. The chains of hills run at right angles be'tween Batoum and Kars; the passes are at very great heights above the sea, and filled during nearly the whole year by the snows which have drifted down from the loftier peaks. Furthermore, the descent from the plateau is very precipitous towards the nortl, and an army from Batoum would find almost hopeless the difficulties of transporting artillery, shot, and shell for the purposes of a prolonged siege. So impracticable is the route from Batoum that even the tide of inland commerce passes along the circuitous channel of Trebizonde and Erzeroum. The road between these two places turns the most difficult ranges, and is accordingly chosen by the caravans even for the traffic with the Russian provinces. OMAR PASHA in earlier years distinguished himself higlily in mountain warfare. That MounrAviEF gave him credit for the ability to pass the mountain barriers that lie between Batoum and Kars is evident from the attack in September, and the despatch in which the defeated General explained it. " Having learned," wrote MouAver, "that OM!AR PASSrA was iwith " a large force at Batoum, I judged it necessary to " attack at once." It maybe said that the Russian thtus told' his adversary w(hat it would be best for him to do, and that it would be wise to follow up a move that had had such immediate and striking effects. But MOVRAVIEFF, perhaps, did not know the weakness of the Turkish army. Even now it is diffiEcult to understand that it shoulld have been so ill provided. A loan had been raised and money was not wanting, the powers of the General were ample, and a Mlushir is not generally scrupulous in making requisitions. Transports were in readiness; even the Turkish vessels of war had been turned into troop and provision ships. But the fact, though unexplained, is not the Isms certain, that the Turkish army was destitute of the means which alone could render possible so hazardous a march across the ridges of Lazistan. The invested city fell, and its reconquest is a task for the future. Should an advance on Kars be resolved on, it is probable that the longer but easier ioute of Erzeroum must be adopted. It must be remembered that Kars is as much defended by climate as Cronstadt. The world will probably never know the losses of MOuRAVIeFF in his relentless blockade, and yet the Russians had been for months on the spot, and were in the neighbourhood of their own resources. The allies will have to march against the new Russian stronghold through a devastated country, where operations are only possible from June to September. It is of the greatest necessity that in such an enterprise the road by which men and supplies are brought should be open as long as possible. It is only the route by Erzeroum and Trebizonde which fulfils these conditions. But it is probable that no sldflul soldier will advise the repetition of an Armenian campaign. When 0-Mmu PAsILw went to Suchum-Kaleh he commenced a campaign which certainly was not for the relief of Kars. We may almost believe that the Turkish General saw the impossibility of a resene, and was content to trace the outline of a more extended plan. A war for the destruction of the Russian pow,er in Asia must be carried on in the regions into whiclh 0MLk PAsnA made his sudden advance. There, at least, we have in our neighbourhood a population of mountaineers which has always struggled against the Russian voke. Even though Georgia might not be conquered, nor the Muscovite frontier driven back behind the Caucasus, yet the warlike tribes between the Black Sea and the Caspian might be. restored to their former independence, and the work of. a quarter of a century made fruitless in a single year. Yet it is no light enterprise to drive a forewarned foe from a country of rocks and ravines, in which he has been accustomed to plant a new fortress at every new step of conquest. We have been two years thinling and talking of the Crimea, and yet how little is Inown of its interior and the obstacles we may meet ! Compared with the Crimes, these Asiatic regions may be called unknown lands. Even the Russian military maps, it is mid, give no correct idea of the comutry. There are other reasons which should induce caution and dissuade from any hasty enterprise. In a little peninsula hardly more than 100 miles long we find ourselves at a loss for effective land transport. Whlo knows whether the British army, even if unopposed, could march to Bakshiserai, 20 miles off ? But an Asiatic campaign miglht cause HMa-MAS or NAPoLEoN to look grave. To surmount the lofty ridges of these Eastern Alps wiU demand resources | which may be supplied, but not without deep forethought and long prepatation. Should the CzAr. persist in an obstinate contest ag,ainst Europe, the timewill assuredlycomewhen these hard-won posses. sions will be endangered by theWestern arms. It is here that Russian territory can be most effectually curtailed and Russian influence most conspicuously nullified. It is for these reasons that we would see such a war cautiously and scientifically approached, and almost look upon the fate of the late foray as a benefit, from the warning it has given us.
Curious people sometimes speculate on the sort of old age that will come on our ne- institutions. How will London lool vith policemen as old as the "' Chaxleys" of our youth, and our: railway stations crowded-with grayhaired porters ? When will there be antiquated "busses" and modimeval Hansoms? On our rallways, indeed, the rolling stock has already gone through more than one generation. Mlany locomotives have died in " harness," while others have entered the station hospitals never to puff and whistle again. But there is one part of our raiways in which we cannot watch the. approach of old age without alarm. The permanent way ought to be endowedwith perpetual youth. It ought not to betray the aha3ing foot and tottering step or the bent form. At the ags-of twenty, now about tih morage agA of railways, it ought to be well nerved and braced for the enormous loads and rapid pace it has often to endure. The locomotive may become asthmatic and crippled; the earriages may occasionally lose a wheel; but if the rail itself begins to sink and twist, and the wooden frame on which it rests become rotten, we shall soon behold. the frequent occurrence of those terrble catastrophes one often hears of across the Atlantic. But what is most fearful to contemplate is the gradual decay of the wooden bridges and viaducts. They are necessarily exposed to the damp both above and below. Above, the carrying " capsills," as they are called, the longitudinal timbers, and even the heads of the upright piles, are continually damp with the moisture of the way; below, a part of the pilesr must be between wind and water, 'and| at that point there will be a rapid decay. Should the construction of bridges be more complicated, and should there be trusses and joinings, the damp will certainly find its way into the " joints of "the harness," and destroy the very fibre and heart of the wood. Everybody knows that, so long as any fabric of wood exoosed to the elements is plausibly painted at proper periods, and occa- sionally stiffened with struts, it will present all the i outward signs of strength. Yet a casual thrust, or a mere shake, will throw it all to the ground, and discover that it has long been a mass of touch- wood and dust. Who has not seen a gatepost or1 a garden rail laid prostrate by the smaUest accident | That is what we have to apprehend in the case of those vast wooden structures that carry trains, weighing, may be, several hundred tons,over valeys, rivers, and roads. It was but the other day that a bridge of piles crumbled to pieces under a passenger train in the United States. It had long been known to be unsafe, but few travellers imagined they would be themselves the last to cross it. At last it swerved, sanik, and disappeared under a heavy train, which followed it into the abyss, and some score of passengers were drowned or much injured. In the United States, where the pace of public affairs is much faster than with us, tne calamity seems to have been taken as a matter of course. In this country we are not yet prepared to sacrifice human hecatombs to economy or speed. So we wish it was in our power to say that all the railways in this country rested materiaUy on solid foundations, and that we had it in our power to assure our anxious countrymen that they are in no danger of a catastrophe. The Corporation of Norwich, it appears, were not to be deceived by appearances, or imposed upon by huge piles and bulLy timbers, standing and lying in solemn state as if meaning to stand for ages. Miniumn te crede colori. They did not like the feel nor altogether the look of these structures, as the trains dashed over them. Moreover, the repairs in actual progress disclosed such a mass of corruption under the sleepers, and, within the piles, sueh a hollow hypocrisy of strength, and themselves seemed so inefficient, that the Mayor of Nonwicn applied to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade for a regular inspection, and obtained one, the report of which our readers must have observed in our yesterday's columns. We have seldom read a more uncomfortable document. It is enough to make one's blood curdle to think that one might have trusted one's limbs and life to timbers in the state described by Lieutenant-Colonel Wm-N. Any day, it appears, the piles might reel from their base, and the longitudinal timbers sink and break under the plunging locomotive. Even the ostentatious repairs, though apparently adding half as much again to the substance of the timbers, have themselves succumbed to the elements, and are the most decaying portion of the -fabric. The citizens of Norwich have an alternative line to the metropolis. They can come by Ipswich, and, if they value their own lives at a day's purchase, after this warning they probably will, for the present at least. But when the young gentlemen go down to Cambridge next term tlley may find themselves breaking down at the Asses' Bridge sooner than they expected, and describing a parabola int proprid persond before they have had the opportunity of investigating its laws. That devotion to science which had looked for a high place in the tripos may have to content itself with illustrating the theory of falling bodies and hydrostatic pressure. It is true that here and there, where matters were very bad indeed, or where the eye of the public was on the state of the struicture, the company has suspended the traffic on one line of rails, and given it a thorough substantial repair; but it is also true that where that repair has been done without any interruption of the traffic it is often very slight and superficial. There is evidently still a great deal that is rotten in the state of the Eastern Counties Railway. But, assuming-what after the appearance of this report it seems impossible to doubt-that the Eastern Counties RPailvay, in its present state, cannot be said to be in working order, cannot be said to be even finished, we conclude that the first thing to be done is at once, and at any cost, to make a good job of it. The Board of Trade, it seems, has not the requisite power to order the closing of the railway for this purpose. It can forbid the opening of a railway til it is safe; but, that sanction once given, and the ceremony of opening once performed, it has no further voice in the matter. The directors, however, will hardly avail themselves of a defect which Parliament can so easily supply. We presume they will, at any cost to themselves and present inconvenience to the public, put the railway, line, bridges, viaducts, and everything, into full working order. But, if they do this, we should like to know from what fund they will draw the means; and if, as they ought, they draw it from the revenue, what dividend are they likely to leave the shareholdera for this year, and :possibly the next? Not a farthing for repairs can vith any propriety be charged upon capital, for a sleeper, bridge, or viaduct once laid down and completed to the satisfaction of the official inspector, has done its duty to the capital, and ought never to :appear in that account again. The present state of the railway, however, betrays the long-suspected fact that the dividends. have been obtained by a neglect of necessary repairs, and the safety of the passengers has been systematically risked for the profit of the shareholders. Small as the dividends have been, they would be still less, most probably nothing, had the Directors done their first duty, which was to the public at large, not to their eimployers. The speculation, of course, r'ill not answer any longer. The company has now to discharge long arrears of reparation, and the' shareholders will probably have to be content with no dividend for a year or two, to make up for those which have been obtsined by starving the permanent way. Should the company'be obstinate, we beg. to suggest thaf, in the event of any lives being lost or limbs brbken by the present state of the way, juries will not be' veiy merciful to the company which has deliberately elected to risk life and limb for .the sake of a dividend.

THE EAST. (FOM OUR OW1N CO;INONDzNT. CONSTANTINOPLE, DEc. 27. Kars, the commission named to inquire into.the state of affairs in Asia, and the councils of war held at the Seraslderat still exclusively occupy attention, so that even the rumours of peace which every post brings us from Europe do not excite so much interest as they would at other times. The arrival of Dr. Sandwith and the particulars of the siege which reach us daily have given quite a tragic character to the history of Asia durinm the last twc months. Hitherto only the general features of heroism on one side and villany on the other were known; but row we see by degrees the dramatfis perso)xu appearing and speaking for themselves. If one listens to this tragedy one can scarcely believe that it is not fiction. The despised Turkish army of Asia, that rabble about which everybody seemed to despair, is converted by the energy and moral. superiority of a few officers into a heroic little band whose discipline, put to the severest test by f.mine and despair, cannot be surpassed by the first soldiers in the world. Although numbers were daily dying from starvation no excesses occurred; in the batteries, where there were always three days' provisions, the famished sentry paced about within reach of them, without allowing himself to be overcome by the temptation. It was the story of Tantalus a thousand times, but more nobly, repeated, for it was moral courage, not physical impossibility, which prevented them from satisfying the cravings of hunger. The inhabitants themselves were scarcely behind the-troops in the display of unselfishness. While theyhad anything-left themselves they sharedvoluntarily with their defenders, and deprived themselves even of their beds to give comfort to some poor fellow in the hospital. The population of Kars is for the most part composed of Turkish Georgians, who, having, before the organization of the Nizam, been often called upon to defend the town and the frontiers, preserve a traditional bravery. The only black sheep among them were the Kara Kalpaks, aTurkoman tribe settled in the town and its environs. These latter served both sides. They were of great help to the Russians in the transport of provisions and material, but, at the same time, they used to be in constant communication with the town, and bring news of the enemy. Now and then a horseman used to appear before the ramparts and fire off his gum as a signal; when some one came out to meet him, he first expressed his doubt about his being a Mussulman, and only when he heard the professiorn of MIahometan faith did he believe his news. Then a kind of sham fight took place to blind the eyes of prowling Cossacks-pistols were fired off, and the horseman disappeared. General WliUiams's intention had always been to cult through the enemy when every hope of relief had disappeared; but the letters which he continued to receive up to the last moment, especially from Selim Pasha, of Erzeroum, made him hope and persevere, and when at last the futility of all these promises dawned upon him it was too late for such a resolution.. A council was held to discuss the possibility of this last remedy, and Kerim Pasha,one of the best and! bravest of the Turkish commanders,-did not hesitate to declare that the emaciated soldiers, even with the courage of despair, could not march with their muskets for a nmile without sinking under the load, and the nearest Russian forces were at four miles' distance from the town. One may imagine what point exhaustion had reached when some time before the surrender a body of Cossacks with two guns approached one of the forts and began to throw shells into it, and of all the guard only three men were able to crawl to their post. Had the Russians known the exact state of things, they could hare taken the town without resistance. Whileinthe town allwerevieing with each other in perseverance and self-sacrifice, meanness and selfishness seemed to be the order of the day without. In spite of all indications of an approaching movement on the side of the Russians, and with all the facilities afforded for providing the town with everything necessary in the beginning of the siege, the grossest neglect prevailed in every department. First, as regards the munitions of war, it will be scarcely credited that only three days' ammunition was in the town for the guns of position. The secret was well kept, and the Russians will have discovered it only after taking possession of the town, for, had they known it, they would certainly have made a few successive false attacks, which would have soon exhausted the ammunition of all the heavy guns. Andthis was the case in a frontier town, exposed every moment to an attack of the enemy, while mountains of- ammunition encumbered the magazines at Erzeroum and Trebizond ? Halett Bey, the Chief of the Ordnance bepartment of the Asiatic army, is under inquiry in consequence. The starvation which ledto the final surrender of the garison in less than four mouths tells its own tale. An exposed fortress like Kars, the key of the surrounding country, ought to have had at least one, if not two years' provisions in it, while the garrison received even in the second month half, and in the end a quarter of a ration. Tahir Pasha, the defterdar, or commissarygeneral, is accountable for it. Notwithstanding repeated requisitions from Generai Williams, from the very beginning he found pretexts for refusing. Had it been left to him the town would have been absolutely without. any provisions at all af the beginning of the investment; fortunately, General Wiliams took the matter into his own hands, and thus was enabled to hold out so long'-batthe difficultiesthrown in his waywere such'that, with aI his energy; he could not* com-i plete his arrangements. .. While the- garrison of Kars was -starving, -the .-defterdar seized by-an uibcountablen economical fit, baigained with Ahel m.leteers, ana iinsisted 'on a difference of a few paras, the result of which was that no bargain was concluded at all Plenty of grain was in the stores of Eraeroum, but the pretext was the' want 'of animals to carry it. There are, however, numberless donkeys in the town, and when it was proposed to employ them the defterdar'g objection was that it would be a sihame to employ donkeys for the Co0mraait of the Imperial army. During the ?lev itelf there were peons who offered to tWem grain to Ears at their own risk, and again economical pretexts prevented this. In the medical depn mentlikewisepeculation had . left the town utterly unprovided. It -vas not the quantity about which one would complain, but the quality, for hundreds of cases arrived containing the most useless drugs, -while all essential things were not provided. Instead of the mistruments necessary for field surgery, cases containing obstetric instruments came out in quantities; cosmetics and other curious medicines, enough for the whole population of Asia Minor, formed the chief portion of the medical supplies. The reason of this is easily explained; the person who had the contract for this lind of supply bought as cheaply as possible all kinds of unsaleable articles in all the back shops of Pera and Galata, and charged them at a high price to the Turk-ish Government, giving a reasonable profit to]those whose interference would have been in. convenient. The consequence is that the Turldsh Government owes him at this present moment 7,000,000 piasters for the supply of medicines to the army, and this to a man who had three years ago not credit for 7,000 piasters! He is likewise under investigation. Thus, you see, there were not a few proximate causes which contributed to the fall of Kars, but they do not excuse anybody for this state of things, which was pretty well known by the constant despatches of General Williams. An Kars was not in a position to save itself, it was to have been saved by others. Now that it has fallen there are no end of councils of war, sendings of troops, and serious thoughts of appointing a proper commander-in-chief for the Asiatic army. The 14 Pashas were the real bane of it, and it is time that this absurd and fatal state oI things should be altered. These councils do not express, as far as I can hear, positive dissatisfaction with Omar Pasha, but the adoption of a new Vlan of campaign implies a tacit disapprobation of his conduct. The flank diversions have been given up, and serious thoughts are given to the defence of Erzeroum and Trebizonde. There is no danger for the moment, for the country is already so covered with snow that it would be impossible for an army to move. There are consequently from three to four months for preparation. tjnder these circumstances it would be perhap3 premature to fix on a defensive plan, which might cripple the operations for next year. OmarPashais said-to have gone to Batoum, andhis armytobe falling back towardsRedoutKaleh. Thusthefamous diversion for the relief of Ears is at an end; but, although it -was rather a strange idea to seek safety for Ears on the Circassian coast, this might become an important point for operations in spring, if it be undertaken independently. The position of the Russians has in the meantime considerably improved by the capture of Ears; for, although of no great importance as a defensive position for the Tlrks, it offers no small advantages to the enemy. It is a pied d terre, which enables them to occupy the Soghanli-dagh and the range of atan, opening thus a road towards the valley of the Churouk-su, but Ears is the more important for them because it gives them every facility of influencing the Kurdish tribes which surround to the south the whole province of Erzeroum. In this respect the Government of Constantinople has much to answer for. It has for years systematically intrigiled to break down the feudal power of the Eurdish chiefs, and to make a source of revenue of them, instead of taking, advantage of their military spirit to form them into an efficient frontier guard. It has sowellsucceeded that now all the Kurdish tribes of the frontier are heart and salv with Russia, and the possession of Ears will extend Russian influence lilewise over the more distant tribes. The English cavalry is getting more and more in order in Scutari. The resolution that the cavalry should definitively come down to spend the winter here was taken so late that the barracks which were to receive them were olly begun at the end of October. Nevertheless a great deal has been done in this time to meet the emergency. General Storks tried both the contract system and the Engineers in the construction of these works. The barracks occupy a high slope in the neighbourhood of the palace of Haidar Pasha, from the gardens of which they are only separated by the road. Nearest to this road are the barracks and stables constructed by Mr. Leahy, C.E. They form a parallelogram of 550 yards by 170, one side of which folrms the barracks, and the three others the stables The system of building adopted is the one commonly used for the roofs of factories, combining strength with lightness, and affording at the same time the freest circulation of air. The barracks for the men are built two storieshigh, with open galleries inside through the whole length, and open passages from one side to the other, Eo that the air can circulate through thewhole building. The same plan has beeu followed in the buildings erected by the Royal Engineers, and the only change adoptedcis that the roof is covered with tiles, and not withtinmplates. The stables are all ina double row, so as to give as much air as possible to the building. It was, nevertheless, found insUfficient, and, in order to remedy this, a plak has been taken out just under the eaves, and lately apertares have likewise been made at the bottom, which may prove a rather dangerous experiment for the horses' hoofs. It does all very well as long as the fine weatherlasts, but it will be different when a day or two of storm and snow comes. The great desideratum for the stables and barracks as well as for the whole neighbourhood of Haidar Pasha is drainage, which, moreover, from the nature of the ground, could be easily regulated. Where the new barracks have been construOcted surface drainage is quite sufficient, and at the same time indispensable, for a few dagy' rain converts the whole neighbourhood intoa sea of mud, perhaps not so sticky as that of the Crimea, but quite sufficient to be exceedingly Unpleasant-ea. soned asit is, 1nofeover, by the-Imeadiig of Beveral thousands of horses and men. In some da4ces, indeed, paving has begn; and aeross the yarda planks have been laid down; but all these are mere palliatives withoutdrainage. The stablesathem. selves require the same thing. The passage through the middle has been, indeed, raised, but it will be soon worn away, and then pools will be formed in the holes left in spite of the natural slope, which ought not to be left entirely to itself. i small paved gutter en both sideswould be quite sufficient for the purpose. The Palace of Eaidar, most of which has been ap. propriated for officeise quarters, isratherworse off in this respect. Situatedinashelteredcbasin, itrlceives all the water of the springs from the neighbour. ing heights, which settle there, converting the grmssplot in front of it. into an inundated meadow. A little work and expense would easily remo'ine this inconvenience, the buildings bemg not more than 600or 700 yards' distance frora the sea, with 6 slope of from 25 to 3O feet. A ditch of a fewv feet it width ,is allthat is requied, not only to render the boiilding dry, but likewis6 the road leading to the barracks. Of course, it cannot be expected -hat everything should be ready at ao short a notioe.

XENox. " Seeing on the one hand that brigandage is continually bcreeasir both in extent and violence, and that now even town are attacked, and their inhabitants either murdered or dragged away as prisonors to be afterwards ransomed by heavy sums; seeing, on the otherhand, the weakness and incapacity of the Government to put down these bandits, notwithstanding its armed force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, &c., we are at a loss what to think of this state of affairs, and do not see to what further point it will reach. That we are, however, on the road to a general disorganization of society we thiMk no one now can doubt. " Tute Government having at its- disposal 20,000,000 6racmnes, having an army, a chamber of deputies, a senate, a police, a garrison, &c., has surrounded the city (Athens) vwth a cordon of soldiers, consisting of five bodies of 25 rmen each, thereby attesting the incapacity of our rulers. Instead of the brigands fortifving themselves against the military force of the Government, it is the Government that fortifies itself against the attacks of the brigands! Behold by wvhat Mnisters, unnhappy Greece is governed i What will foreiguers say, beholding the Greek Governmuent acting on the defensive against a handful of bandits?' ' c" X XTP.ACr OF A LETrER FRoM ATALiANTA. " The state of this district is growing daily worse; the brigands have now become masters of the whole province, murdering and torturing. Their latest tragic deed is the Zollowing: " On the 11th of December, about 4 o'clock in the aftersooo, a band of 15 sobbers attacked the village of Steersi, elonging to the Demos of Thermopyle. They seized and poured scalding oil over the bodies of the mayor, of his daugnter, and of his daughter-in-law. Havig stripped him of all he possessed, and plundered the whol. illae, they then kindled a fire, and threw upon it two women, who had sttenmpted to escape.

SECOND EDITION. THE PIMES OFFICE, TPe.sdayj lornwiq. THE PEACE NrEGOTIATIONS. (BY SumuitRlz AND BmIissH TYEEGIRiA.P.) We have received the following telegraphic conimu nication from our correspondent at Berin 3BERT,TE TuEsDAY 31osrnC. "The D;iesden Jouitno states that telegraphic advices from St. Petersburgr represent that the peace negotiations are progressing favourably. An unconditional rejection of the proposals by Russia is not feared." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris eorrespondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. - A letter from Constantinople, dated 26th December, is to the following effect:- "A Grand Council was held this day, at the Sublime Porte, relative to the military operations. Nothing has transpired as yet which can give us an idea of what passed. " It is calculated that at least ,60 vessels of the Imperial navy have been despatched, during some days past, from our port for Asia. Their first destination is Suchum-Kaleh. Hosrew Pasha is the person who suporintends the embarca tion, and every one speaks highly of his zeal and activity. " The Sublime Porte has addressed to the embassies and the legations at Constantinople the following memoranduam: -' Measures were taken some tirse since relative to the judgments on law suits and differences arising betw-een the subjects of the Empire and those of friendly Powers, and which were brought before the Tribunal of Commerce. " These measures were recognized by all the foreign missions, and in conformity with that adhesion, eaclh Legation appointed merchants, either by special choice or by ballot, to appear on a fixed day and hour at the Tribunal of Commerce, in order to proceed in concert with the members of the Council to the hearing and the judgment of the cases and the differences submitted to their jurisdiction. At its commencement this new state of things followed a regular course; but for some time past the merchants delegated by the Legations do not attend the Tribunal regularly, though their presence is necessary to render valid the decisions of the Council. Complaints have been transmitted by the Minister relative to this irregularity which gave rise to delays prejudicial to the parties interested. In consequence the representatives of thefriendly Powers areprayed to recommnend punctualitytothe merchants whom theyhave selected to form part of the Tribunal of Commerce, and to engage tnem to attend on the days and hours appointed." A letter fromu Kainiesch, of the 23d, says:- " Intense cold has succeeded the torrents of rain we have had. In the plain of Inkermann the thermometer (Centigrade) has fallen to 17 degrees below zero ; and at Kamiesch itself there have been 15 degrees of cold. The transports to the camp have not been affected, and our operations are limited to the necessities of the local consumption. The tlaw commences to-day, and it will soon be possible to effect the transport -with less difficulty. French vwines continue to be abundantlyoffered for sale; and the operations during December took place at from 11f. to USRf., according to quality. Various sales were made this week of Cognac brandy in harrel and case, and in particular one of 400 barrels at If. 55c. the litre, andof 200 cases at 20f. the case of 12 bottles. IRum is sold, according to quality, from lf. 30c. to If. 50c. the litre. Bordeaux wine in case is sold at from 1:5f. to 24f., according to quality, and Champagne at from 3S6. to 42f., according to its mark." A letter fromi Kars, of the 2d of December, says:- 'The last moments of resistance were marked by heroism. For a long time each soldier on duty had been in the habit of receiving only half a ration, and on this a reduction was soon made for the inhabitants. The portion for each man dimnished from day to day. "The last distribution of provisions took place the 23d of November. Five times the quantity of provisions wTould have been necessary to appease the hunger of the soldiers and the inhabitants. They had no longer a morsel. The men sank without uttering a word, and withdrawing from public gaze to conceal their pangs, and to beguile their hunger in a sort of stupor, to which their sufferings bad granted a cessation of some instants. A third of the garrison, in. habitants and soldiers, lay stretched on the ground, and awaited without a murmur their last moments. The rest tried to keep life up as best they could. " On the 28th, when the convoy of provisions brought by the Russians entered the town, the enemy were astonished that it was not attacked by the populace, but only a small number of persons surrounded the waggons. The Russians were soon finished with them, and waited some time for the rest of the inhabitants to come up, but no one came. After some search they learnt that the soldiers and inhabitants were so exhausted as not to be able to leave the houses. They, therefore, resolved to go from house to house to distribute the provisions personally. The great part of the sick were suffering from inflammation of the intestines, and among some the malady had made such progress that they could not eat their rations, but died beside thc food tLey had so eagerly lon,ged for- On the 28th the enemy took possession in form, but their definitive entry was postponed to the 30th. The first care of the Russian officers was to organize an interjss Administration, to preserve the tow n from disorder. The nunsber of sick amounted to near 6,000, and the greatest activity and zeal were displayed in attending to them. On the evening of the same day the officers of the regular troops were informed that they should quit Kars onl the 1st of December, and that they were to proceed to Alexandropol, where they shouldbe provisionally detained. They were allowed to make their preparations in perfect liberty. In the meantime the Volunteers, the Redifs, and Bashi-Bozonks, quitted freely the towvn, pursuant to the terms of capitulation. On the 1st, the officers left, as had been announced, and the Russians definitively occupied the towni. The Ge. neral officers had terminated their preparations. The Commander-in-Chief,Vassif Pasha, and Generals Hussein Pasha and Kerim Pasha, General Williams and his staff, among whom -were remarked Colonel Like, Major Teesdale, Captain Thomson, and his Secretary, Mr. Churchill, quitted the towvn, with all the superior officers of the regular troops, accompanied by an escort, on their way to Alexandropol." A fev; lines from Erzeroum state that the Government contintued to concentrate about that place an imposing military force. It was not believed that the RPssians could do anything in that direction, and that they appeared disposed to evacuate Kars forthe winter after having previously taken away all the disposable 2nat.biel. The Mostiteus- dus Loiret publishes the following letter. dated Kinburn, 15th December:- " On the 12th there vws a general breaking up of the ice in the Liman of the Dnieper, and our flotilla anchored in it found itself in a most critical position. The vessels most distant froml the coast were exposed to the shockc Of enormous masses of ice, and their chains being broken they drifted with the current. The floating battery Lave was one of them, and it was at one time feared that she would be driven on the shoals which- line the Russian- side of the ILiman. She fortunately succeeded in avoiding that danger by the skilful manceuvres of her crew, which brought her into the free waters of the Black Sea, and ultinsately to the coast of Kinburn. Our anxiety was very great for some hours, and to-day everybody admits that. the position of the vessels is untenable. What occurred on the 12th must necessarily again take place in the course of the winter. It is accordinglybelieved that the flotilla detached to Kinburn will be shortly recalled to Kanmiech, and that to make up for its w-ithdrawal the gas-rison of the fortress will be co-siderably reinforced." By an Imperial decree, of the 22d nit., General Lelllinet, who already held a command in the Imperial Guard, has been appointedto command the division of infantry of the limperial Guard, formed of the regiments which lately retumed fiom the Crimnea. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received M:7- ,E6 '- A" SE MMEb , T.LN. e. The Louqsor has arrivedfrom Constantinople, with accounts to the 2;th ilt. They confirm the announcement that Marshal Pelissier will not quit the Crimea, and 'that General Mfartimproy will replace him in the Council-of War which is to be held in Paris. General Bazaine had arrived at Constantinople. i "The Russians have inereamed the fortifications which they had raised near Inkermann, and have unmas3ked the batteries near t-he Tchernaya. "During two days, when near Kntais, the arny of Omar Pasha was in want of provisions, in consequence- of the overflowing of the rivers. "In the neighbourhood of Sebastopol a very sudden thaw had taken place." f"BERLIN', JAN 6. "An aide-de-camp of the Emperor of Austria arrived at Dresden to-day, charged with a niission to the German Courts, probably including that of Berlin. Prince Bodisco, an Attach6 of Legation, and the bearerof documents relative to the negotiations of the Government of Washington-I with that of St. Petersburg, passed through this city yesterday." "TURIN, JA2. . "General della Marmora leaves to-morrow for Pans, where he is to assist at the military conferences ich are to be held in that city. General Chazal, sent on a special mission by the King of the Belgians, was received on the 4th by His Majesty, and leaves to-morrow." The J7ur de l'An was favoured by fine weather, and tho retailers sold largely. The small shops established along the boulevards, which only opened on the 30th ult., disposed in two days of the greater part of their stock. The payment of the enormous amount of bills due on the 31st of December was effected more easily than was generally expected, but that of many invoices, presented in the last days of the month, was postponed, to the great inconvenience of traders. The manufacturers whose goods were remarked at the Universal Exhibition, but particularly those who obtained medals, are in a prbsperous condition, having greatly extended the circle of their relations, particularly with foreign countries. The provincial manufacturers are now in the dead season, whichl generally lasts until the 15oth of January. The indutstrial establishments of Rouen, Alsace, Roubaix, and Amiens, however, are not idle, and those of Lyons are in full activity and likely to continue so until the end of winter. The fall in the price of grain made new progress during the week. The important arrivals at Havre, from the United States and Spain, and at Marseilles from the Mediterranean countries, have baffled the calculations of farmers who, reckoning on a scarcity of corn in spring, kept back their produce, which they are now most anxious to part -with. Hence the markets are everywhere abundantly supplied, and rates fast declining. Algeria alone will have made up one-third of the supposed deficiency in the crop. Upwards of 1,000,000 of hectolitres of wheeat have been already imported from that country, and between 800,000 and 900,000 more (deposited in silos by the Arabs, and which they only sell when the growing crop offers a favourable appearance) will most probably be avaable in March and April next. The sale of flour in the Paris market was difficult during the week, notwithstanding the readiness of tlle lholders to abate their pretensions. The choice quality still fetched from 102f. to 103f. per sack of 157 kilogrammes, but good marks might be had much lower. The stock in the halle exceeded 25,000 metrical quintals, and the stores at La Villette contained from 27,000 to 28,000 metrical quintals more, and from 18,000 to 20,000 of wheat. The cattle markets of Sceaux and Poissy are well supplied, and rates evince a downward tendency. The Palis butchers are beginning to be reconciled to the assize of meat, and many even sell under the fixed price, which shows that they are allowed by the authorities more than a reasonable compensation. There is no change in the w-ine trade at Bercy, prices still maintaining themselves very firmL The Emperoryesterday received in public audience MI. de Olaguibel, who presented letters acerediting hini to his Imperial 3Majesty as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Mexico. The Emperor afterwards gave private audience to the Marquis d':ntonini, Envoy Extraordinary and -Minister Plenipotentiary of. the King of the Two Sicilies, who presented the reply of his Sovereign to the letters of recall of Al. Delacour; to MI. Rumpff, Resident Minister of the FreeTowns of Germany, who presentedthereply of the Senate of Fraukfort to the letters of recall of the Marquis de Tallenay; and to Baron de D(ernberg, who presented to His Imperial MIajesty letters from His Royal Highness the Elector of Hemse, putting an end to his mimion as Resident Minister at Paris. The .31miteur says " Two battalions of the 50th of the Line, and the three battalions of the 39tb, detained at sea by bad weather; were not able to make their entrance into Paris with their comnpanions in arms on the 29th nlt. These troops, who have recently arrived, wilg enter the capital on Wednesday. The Emperor will send General Niel, his aide-de-canp, who directed the workcs of attack at the siege of Sebastopol, to receive them; and they will be passed in review by His Majesty in the Court of the Tuileries at 1 o'clock." - The Gazette drAngoumois says that among the nlmerous candidates for the see of Rochelle, now vacant, Prince Lucien Bonaparte, son of the Prince of Camino, appears to have the greatest chance of success. Imperial decrees confirm tlree nominations to thle Legion of Honour, and the grant of 18 military medals made by MIarshal Pelissier to officers and men of the army of the East.

The Austrian Minister only reached the Russian capital in the evening of the 26th, and it may, therefore, reasonably be supposed that the despatches in question contain little more than an account of his first impressions, When the messenger left St. Petersburg Count Esterhazy had not had an audience of tlhe Emperor Alexander, and it was not espected that he w6uld bee admitted to the Imperial presence intiln after the New Year. It is related that theAutian Minister, who announced by electric telegraph the departure of his courici', made no mention of the reception given by Courit Nesselrode to the propositions of which he was the bearer, andit is not unlikely that suclvwas the case, as the Russians are renowned for their tdkll in finding the key to despatches written in cipher. As you were yesterday inforned, Colonel Manteuafel had a private audience of His lajecty the imperor, and delivered into his .hands the letter of -which he was the bearer, but nothing more is known of its con'tents than that it contained a refisal onthe part of the Royal writer to assist in enforcing the conditions forwarded by Austria to the St. Petersburg Cabinet. Although Colonel Manteuffel did not reach this city until 9 o'clock in the evening of the 2d, he immediately called on Count Arnim, the Prussian Einister at this Court, and remained with him for some time. Yesterday, before he waited on the Emperor, the Prussian Military Envoy called on the Minister for Foreign Allhirs, and on Count Grinue, HisMajesty's principal Adjutant-General. There is a person in this city who is particularly well-informed of what passes in Russian and military circles, and he assures me that there is no chance whatever of Austria's placing her army on a warfooting next spring. The reason given by Austria for the reduction of her army vwas, that she wished to diminish her expenses during the winter. She has attained her aim, but it is very questionable whether she will, should she feel inclined, be able speedily to place her army on such a footing as it was six months ago. The infantry can be called out at a very short notice, but it would be no easy matter to replace the 45,000 artiLlery and train horses which have been sold. A great number of the horses havecrossed thefrontierintoPrussia; France andEngland have exported some 4,000 or 5,000, and the re- mainder are the property of private individuals whol are not likely to consent to sell them at the prices at which they purchased them from the State. The average prices paid by Government for horses are 1809. and 200id., but many of the animals recently sold by auction were knocked down to the highest bidders at 40fl. and 5011. The keep of each horse is calculated at 20f1. a month, so that the saving on 46,000 horses in five months will only amount to 4,5000ff. As Government will, in case of need, be obliged to re-purchase horses at enormously high prices, it is questionable whether it would not have been better to leave the artillery, cavalry, and baggage-train in faU force, and to have made retrenchments in the infantry alone. Twvo diplomatists have to-day expressed to me their strong hope that Austria " wiU act up to her engagements" if Russia should reject her propositions; but The Times probably took a correct view of the matter, when, on the 12th of December, it said "If the terns are not acceded to by Russia, Austria will break off her diplomatic relations, and withdrawv her Ambassador from the Court of St. Petersburg, as a preliminary step towe know not what desperate resolution she is to adopt hereafter." - In my opinion, it is by no means certain that the Austrian MIinister will quit St. Petersburg inmmediately, if Russia should propose a modification of the propositions, but you will do well to recollect that the diplomatic world is, almost to a man, of a different way of thinking. On the 2d, Count O'Donnel, one of the Emperor's adjutants, left Vienna for Dresden, and it is believed that he is the bearer of an autograph letter from HisiMajesty to the King of Saxony. The Saxon Court has not behaved well towards Austria ever since the Emperor's marriage, but it would perhaps have been better policy to have shown the same attention to King John as to the Prussian and Bavarian Monarchs. The prices of the inite-im shares of the Credit Bank have been quoted on 'Change since the 2d of this month. Many months must elapse before the shares can get into what are here called "firm"' hands, and therefore they are likely to undergo many ups and downs. Many applications have recently been made by foreign houses to the National Bank for information relative to the State domains which are to be sold by that institution. In the provinces in which the landed property is in many hands -the estates will not be broken up into -lots, but in Hungary, where a few individuals are in possession of the greater part of the kingdom, the State domains will be parcelled out. In order that you may know exactly what importance to attach to any information which may in future be extracted from the Oesterreichische Zeitimg, it is necessary to inform you that that paper has changed hands. Mr. Warrens, who was its proprietor and principal editor, has realized a handsome fortune on 'Change, and retires into private life. His successors are Professor Stein, who is learned in national economy and statistics, and M. Isidore Heller, tlle private secretary of Baron Brack, who a year ago wrote from Constantinople such violent anti-English and French letters to the Triest Zeitung. It is not yet positively known whether the paper has become the property of Baron Bruck, but it is related that such is the case. The Austro-German currency Conference will meet here on Monday, the 7th, but the rivalry between Austria and Prussia is so great that there is little chance of their coming to an understanding. The telegraphic accounts from Warsaw of the state of Prince Paskewitsch's health are unfavourable. The excessive severity of the weather is said to have produced a very bad effect on the Marshal. The Helvetic Congregation (Calvinistq) has- just published an account of its operations during the year 1855. There were but 92 marriages, although the banns of 289 couples were published. It is worthy of remark that dut of the 92 marriages 64 were " mixked," that is, the parties were of different religious rpersuasions. Further, there were 226 children christened, 97 children confirmed, and 672 persons buried. At MIilan there is at present such a superabundance of French gold, that napoleons are only taken for 23 lire (I5s. 4d.) Silver is unusually scarce. According to the December balance sheet of the Bank, the stock of bullion was 433,000fl. larger than in November. The bill portfolio was also larger by 3,322,0001f. The notes in circulation amounted to 377,880,0001l., or 3,336,000fl. more than in November, although the Bank had received 6,105,000 on account of the shares which have just been emitted. The Austrian Iloyd steamer Asia, which was reported to have been on fire between Beyrout and Alexandria, had reached the last mentioned city on the 23d of December. The Espero relates that a Sicilian, who had supplied-the- British with 50.-mules, undertook to send 300. more on board their transports. After the contract had been'signed, the Kinng prohibited the exportation of any more mules. The Italian paper drily remarks, that the eight English ships of the line are probably gone to Messina to pay a visit to the mules. -Few people here are inclined to doubt that the King of Naples will at last get into very serious difficulties. PRUSSIA. (FROM OUR OWN' CORaSPONDMT.) The political situation here is, I believe, entirely unaltered since I last addressed you on this subject. Colonel von Manteiufel, you will have seen from other reports, did not leave Dreaden so early as Monday evening, as my accounts stated, but stayed there; tiU the aftemo6n of the following day. The reason of this prolongation of visit may be found in the simultaneous presence in the Saxon capitalof the representatives of Saxony at Vienna, Berlin, and London. This -conuence of diplomatic experience and inifuexic6 would-form a welcome opportunity for the furthering of the purposes of his mison, whfich must - be understood to have had its centre of gravity in Dresden, that which he has to do in Vienna being of secondwy importance, though not uc totally unimportant as it in here represented tc b%. -Sinultaneouily with the departure of Colonel von Manteufel tor Pre on o y, the 3lt nit., Captain Yon Itauch left here for St. Petersburg, bearing privr,te despatches from the King and Court to the Imiperfal family of Russia, but, as far as I have been able to learn, no official note was forwarded by this opportunity, and indeed, with regard to the advocacy of the Austrian proposals of peace, I have some reason to believe that no note has as yet been draclwnuponthesubject, and certainlynone hasas yet been sent off. As respects the sentiments that are likely to pervade the future note I have heard nothing to make me as yet modify the conjecture I put forward about 10 days baek, that Prussia will in general terms advocate peace, but in no way adopt the Austrian propositions as her own, with or without threats of contingencies. The exact intonation of the language, that will clothe the above outline in the necessary roundedness of form, will depend upon what Colonel von Mianteuffel learns in Vienna of the intentions of that Cabinet; the more categorical and positive Austria7s intended course of action towards Russia is to be, the less will Prussia identifyherself with it ;the less Austria is determined to follow up words with actions, the nearer will Prussia permit her language to approach that of Austria. It is talked of here that Bavaria will soon send a special Envoy to Russia to back the Austrian proposals, so as not to be behind Saxony. This is, however, improbable- first, because the Bavarian Minister, Count Bray, has onlyjust retarned to his post at St. Petersbmro, atnd could have taken with him any communmications the Bavarian Cabinet might have to make; secondly, the Bavarian Government is not taking that prominent part in the matter which the activity of the Saxon Mlinister at Paris, Baron von Seebach, misleads the world into believing the Saxon Government is taldng; (this activity of the diplomate in question arises from his being the representative of Russian interests at Paris and the son-in-law of Count Nesselrode ;) and, thirdly, the mission of Baron Seebach has only a very distant connexion with the Austlian proposals, certainly not that of direct advocacy. From Vienna letters I extract two little incidents, which will serve to show in some degree how the land lies there. The daily telegraphic despatches which the Emperor receives from Warsaw informing him of the fluctuations in Prince Pask6witsch's health, are immediately after being brought to his knowledge conveyed to Prince Gortschakoff, who. would otherwise have to wait for a less direct communication. In military circles in Vieuna it is currently stated and believed, that the Austrian Government has been invited to send a General to assist at the tilitary Council about to be held at Paris. Baron Hess is indicated in the invitation as -the officer whose presence would be most welcome. The. Austrian Government had declined complying w ith the invitation. For some days past there' have been parties of sailors, chiefly from Mecklenburg, .remarked on various railways, on their way to London, where they are to enter our naval service: in one party there were as many as 18. Since Christmas-day the Court has removed from Charlottenburg to Potsdam; to-morrow, however, the King and Queen, and their entire household, come to Berlin for the season. The Prince andlPrincess of Prussia, with their son and daughter, and the Prince Regent of Baden, will arrive here in the course of this week. The BerEn season par excellewce consists of the period between New Year and Lent, which, Prussia being a Protestant country, is most appropriately called the Caxnival. As Easter falls very early this year, the usual number of State festivities will be necessarily very crowded together. On Wednesday, the 16th inst., the first of three grand Court Balls is to be given, and repeated both following Wednesdays, and in addition to them several concerts will be given at' Court, under the conduct of Meyerbeer. Some of the Ministers have already commenced their soiries; the M1inister President, however, waits for the re-assembling of the Chambers, w-hich will take place this week or the following. The Ministers and the Princes do not, however, i bring their season to a close with the arrival of AshWednesday, but continue it till Easter; after that everything is over for the year. Duke George of ,eckl;enburg-Strelitz arrived here last night with his spouse the Grand Duchess Catherine, and have taken up their abode in the hotel of the Russian Embassy, where they celebrate to-day the Russian Christmas. I incorrectly announced his arrival here a week ago, when, although he was expected here, he succeeded only in attaining Mecklenburg-Strelitz, while Duke William of Mfecklenburg-Schwerm actually did arrive here to grace this capital. The latter, who is Colonel of the Prussian Cuirassier Regiment, Garde dii Corps, is party to the persecution of two men on the part of this Government that does the Prussian State no honour and the Senate of Hamburg great discredit. One individual in question, named Vehse, is the author of a voluminous work entitled The History of the Petty Courts of Gernatty, thechief attraction of which isthe amount of scandal it dishes up; and among the persons whose names are mentioned rather irreverently in connexion with the Court of Mecklenburg, not to point a moral but to adorn the tale, are Duke William of AleclenburgSchwerin, and his sister, now married to Prince Windischgratz. The work is published in Eamburg, but fora longtime the habitat of the author could not be ascertained; about a week or two back, however, it came to the knowledge of the Mecklenburgersthat the author was living in Berlin, and their Iinister here was instructed to proceed against him here by moving the State prosecutor to indict him for the libel. As first step the man was imprisoned, then questioned as to the source, fromn whom he derived his information. He 'stated as his authority his publisher in Hamburg, Campe. A Prussian cri- minal judge, the director of criminal police, and. another official, are forthwith despatched to Hamburg to examine further, the HIamburg Senate is so weak and cringing as to comply with every wish expressed, and cites the publisher as ivitess to give evidence in the casein which he is himself accused of being the chief accessory. On his refusal to give up his authority for the information he gave the author he is thrown into prison, and only released after various examinations, heavy bail, and all Hamburg setting itself on its hind legs, rampant at the violence and injastice done to one of its most respected citizens. The publisher (though at liberty) is still under heavy penalties for every day that he refuses to give the requlred information, and the author is still here in durance vile Xinder the charge of publishing a libel on a crowned head of Germany-which in this case is stretched to mean two of his children. I must not venture to repeat to you the pretty stories that have caused all this potlier, lest I also should be immured, and you be deprived forthwith of any more letters firom your own correspondent in Berlin.

They soon proceeded to the south. west, and shortly after the Russian steamer Count Vrontchonko was able to eter the port. On the 4th December the coast became covered vith ice. and on the 5th the telegraphic service was suspended on ail the line of the northern coast." A letter from St. Petersburg, in the Co7logne Garete, contains,the following:- "Pince Galitzin, inspector of the inperial manufactosy Df arms, has arrived here from Moscoiw, with reports on the question of the new levies of troops which are to be raised independently of the arrire-4aen Theheadsof the artillery published to-day an official notice for the adjudication of the trinsport of cannon and munitions of war, to the weight of D9899 puds (3a835,9601b.) fromn aloulgatoBriaslc Besides i large supply of mortar platforms, which are demanded for Cronstadt, carpenters, locksmiths, and blacksmiths are required in as great numbers as can be obtained.

A letter from Copenhagen, in the Unirersal Gee man Gazetle of Leipsic, says that, when neither France, England, the Netherlands, nor Sweden had intimated any intention of sending delegates to the proposed conference on the Sound Dues, Russia acceded to the invitation sent round, because there is a possibility that Denmr may one day fall into her possession by regular descent, and she is, consequently, anxious to preserve the dues. AMERIC& (BY EBIMC T=LGRAPPT-) LUVERPOOIs TuSDAY, 10 A.3r. The United States steamerBaltic has arrived, with advices from New York to the 26th ult., and 300,000 dollars specie on freight. Congress had again adjourned without electing a Speaker, consequently there is no President's message. The steam rhip Northern idght has been seized by the Government, as she was about to leave New York, on a Filibustering expedition to Nicaragua. A large number of the adventurers had been captured. In seizing the Northern Light she had to be bronght to with a round shot from a revenue cruiser, which afterwards made the steamer anchor under her guns. . The British ship Resolute, abandoned in the Arctic ice, hia been taken into Newhaven. The Hudson's Bay Arctic expedition, in search of Franldin, had returned, after reaching, the pLace where Franklin's crews were reported to have perished. Dr. Rae's report was fully confrmed. They met Esquimaux in that vicinity who had seen the whites, and gave much valuable information. On the island were discovered the remains of a boat, which had been partially destroyed by the natives for the sake of the wood and the metal fastenings, although there was suficientleft to identify it as belonging tothe Fxanklin expeiition, one fragment of wood (now as well as some other small relics in the possession of the Hudson's Bay Company at Lachine), having the name Terror branded on it, while another piece has the name of Mr. Stanley (Surgeon of the Erebus) cut upon it, this latter being part of a snow shoe, evidently of English manufacture, being made of oak, a species of wood no man accustomed to use snow shoes would ever select for the purpose. No papers or books, and no human remains, were found. The Esquimaux were very friendly, and freely dislayed all their treasures obtained from the boat or found near it, and these consisted principally of the oars, used by them as tent poles, the boat kettles, the empty preserved meat cases, &c., but no papers, and the natives stated, with every evidence of sincerity, that none had ever been seen or found; everything portable was secured aud brought back. It would be useless to recount them all, but we may mention bar iron, rope with the Government mark on it, oars branded with the broad arrow, pieces of bantin (remains of a fag), a letter holder, a step of a mast, &c., all clearly European, and all Government supplies. Advices from Mexico state that the Solent left Vera Cruz, on the 5th lilt., with $2,500,000. From the New York commercial letters we learn that there was a sliglht improvement in the stock market, and a good feeling prevailed. For money there was an active demand, with an adequate supply, at the rates previously current, namely, 10 to 12 per cent. The last Bank statement was considered favourable. In exchange the business was not active, and the market closed fatly at 84 to 9 per cent. on London. The cotton market ruled quiet, with prices in favour of purchasers. Flour had advanced 12Mc., in consequence of an increased export demand. Scotch pig iron was quiet, but firm, at $31 to $32; fi other matters there was no material change.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. AUSTRIA. (FROw OUR oWN CoDRrPON@ThNT.) EAportionof the foUowingappeared in our second edition of yesterday :-I VIENNA, JAmv. 2. 1 At the begining-of the year it may be wdUto cast a retrospective glance at what has been done in the einpire duringthe Iasttwelve months. At midnight, -oi the 31st of December, 1864, Baron Baiungartner, who was then Minister of Finances and Public Works, ceded to an Austro-French Company a part -of the State railroads and certain valuable industrid e6tablishments. The State made a bad bargain, but the currency was in a pitiable state, and Baron Bau-mgartner hoped to improve it by bringing foreign capital into the country. His expectations, however, were not fulfilled, for the purchasers of the railroads, instead of paying the several instalments of the 80,000,000 florins in French money, bought Austrian " Metillics' at very low prices, and with them discharged their- obligation3 to the State. The consequence of thix nanom-re was that the premu.ium -on silver wa*-. Tarely lawer than 26 per cent. during -the first few months of the [year 1855. Baron- Baumgartner's speculation was a failure. but by the sale of the State railroads he had estiblished a new principle, and his successor did not fail to take advantage of it. Baron Bruck obtained permission from the Emperor to consolidate the "-floating" debt of the State to the Bank, by means of a cession of State domains of the value of 155000,000 florns. His next measure was to estabish a mortgAxe bank, which at no distant, tnme promises to e of inmiiiene advantage to the landed proprietors, whQ havehitherto been obliged to make ruinous sacrifices whenever they have had recourse -to the moneyed aristorac for pecuniary assistance. The last step taken by Baron Bruck -in the old year was to establish a credit bank for commerce and trade, which has such extensive privileges that it can hardly, if properly managed, fail to become one of the most prosperous commercial institutions in Europe. The Minister of Finances is nowv treating with the NTorthern Railroad Company, which is extremely desirous to obtain permission to construct the projected railroad from Vienna to Salzburg; but Baron Bruck has two strings to his how, and it is not unlikely that an Anglo-French Company will have the preference. The Credit Bank is endea-vouingto obtain the Italian railroadsafor itself and ertain Engish, French, and Italian houses; but the seUlerand tie buyer will find. considerable difficulty in coming to an understanding about the price. A YThen Baron Rothschild some time since thought of becoming the purchaser of the railroads in question, there was a difference of 40 per cent, between is offer and the demand madeby the State. As the Raab-Setulin Railroad is likely to be a matter of European importance, no pains have been spared to obtain authentic information on the subject, and a summary of the result of my inquiries will now be given :-On the 26th of November, 1855, certain Hungarian nobles applied for permission to construct a railroad from Raab, or Szony, to some point on the Danube, near Serlin, and, on the 11th - of the following month, the Austro-French com- pany, which bought the Government railroads on the 31st of December, 1854, made a similar appIica-tion. The contract made between Baron Baumgartner and the Austro-French Company had three secret articles, and the third of them is as follows:- ".Ar. 3. The abovementioned con;pany is empowered, -whenever it may apply for permisson, to p;oong the Vienna-Raab R ad, a to connect the same _with the Marchegg-Pesth line by means of a bride over theDanube, -or by some other method wMhic shdS le approved by the Austrian Government." The article is very V3gue, but my common sense and my map tell me that the Hungarian nobles will not interfere with the privilege of the Austro3rench company if they construct a railroad from Itaab to some point near SemIin. The natural continuation of the Marchegg-Pesth line is by way of Temesvar, through the valley of the Marosch, to Cronstadt, and thence through the Oitosch Pass to Buchareat. The line projected by the Hung-arian mobles, which is from RIab by way of Stuhilweissenburg and Essegg to the Servian frontier, is intended --to form a junction with. tho Constantinople rail- road near Belgrade. The surveyors have declared that it is impossible to throw a bridge over the Save between Semlin and Belgrade, so that the comraunication between the Turkish and Austrian railroads will probably be at 3itrovitch or Schebatch. The entire length of the projected railroad is 64 German, or about 310 English miles, but the lower part of the line, or that between Essegg and Eemlin, will not even be traced until it - is definitely settled what direction the Con- statinople railroad is to take. Baron Bruck -will probably endeavour to bring about a fusion between the Austro-French Cormpany and the Hingarian landed proprietors, as their co-operation is absolutely necessary, the former having money, and the latter the land through which the projected railrad must run. The question of the abolition of the antiquated guild system sti greatly occupies the Austrian -world, and the idea of free competition, which was first broached by the Minister of Commerce, is beginning to find more favour in the sight of the -tradig world. The Peath Chamber of Trade has declared itself in favour of free competition in trade, and the Briinn Chamber has followed its example. Indeed the report sent in by the latter is to the effect that the " Gewere-freTheit is at one and the ~.same time a necessity and a salutary measure for Austria." It does not appear necessary to enter more nearly into the matter at present, but it strikes me that the liberty of exercising any craft will be the greatest reform that has ever been made in this -empire. (FROm OUR BBmR- eonoasPoNDnZ-T.) BERLIN, Jsr. v.

There are, it is true, some statesmen who think differently, but they are a minority and cannot just. now make their voices heard: the majority are not for peace; nor, according to the estimate formed there of the popular feeling, could any diminution of the Czar's external power be conceded without producing a fearfu]- shock to the popular belief in his inviolable majesty. To evade the subject of the proposals or the demands made by the allies, the constant subterfuge is to allege what they call the cause of the war, viz., that the Sultan has been un: fiithfulto his treaty obIigationsy. and that all differences that have arisen, in onsequence must be settled between him alone and Russia! The entire Russian forces are at present distributed under the following, commanders:-Generalissimo of the whole active army, Prince Pa3kiewitsch; Commander in Finland, General von-Berg; in St. Petersburg, Count Riudiger and General Arbusoff; in Esthland, General Grabbe; Baltic corps, General Sievers; Central Army (Kieft), General Paniutin ; Western Army (Poland), General Soumarakoff; Souithern Army, General Luders -Criimean Army, Prince Gortschakoff; Danubian territory, General Chomutoff; Kubanschis territory, Gene[ral Serebriakoff; Caucasus, General Bebutoff; Transcaucasus, General Mouravieff. The Mon4t diennel publishes the following letter, dated St. Petersburg, December 29:- " Although Count Esterhazy has been here three days and had a private intarview with Count Nesselrode the day before yesterday, the question of peace has not made one Step in advance since m last letter, -and, if certain forebodings are to be implicitly trusted, the chances of peace have considerably diminished. Happily Muscovite diplo. macy is well understood abroad, and it is known that the public manifestations are not always the true expression of its sentiments and of its thoughts. " However, all that is taking. place is not of a nature to give confidence to the people, and the nomination of Prince Alexander Menschikoff to the post of Military Governor. General of Cronstadt has greatly alarmed the Peace party. It was thought that the whole family of the Mensehikoffs was in disgrace ; judge, then, of the effect produced at the choice of the Emperor, when no one suspected it. It is a trick of the old Russian party, which has become'quite lively since the fall of Kars, and which, headed by the Grand Duke Constantine, does all it can to continue the war. "All agree that Prince Menschikoff is by no means fitted for the important post in which he has just been placed through the interest of the High Admiral of Russia. " In his long military career the Prince never gave proof of remarkable talent. You know him as a diplomatist, andevery one has been enabled to form an opinion upon him in the mission he fulfilled about three yes since at the OttomanPorte. It is to the sauperfidilityof her AmbassadorEFxtraordinary thxt Rusia is indebted for a war of which no one can, as yet, for*well the end. Minister of Marine under the late Emperor Nicholas, Prince Menschikoff only left behind hinm remembrances of his wayward and capricious character. As Commander-in-Chief of the army in the Crimea he had the singular talent of allowing the allies to land withoutopposition, assertingthat he would throw them back into the sea-and you are aware how he kept his promise at the battle of the Alma. " When the Russian Government recalled Prince Mtens. chikoff from the Crimea its decision respecting him was founded upon the well-known incapacity of the AdmiralGeneralissimo. His years had evidently not increased his tact, military precision, and skillinmanagingan army, qualities which he never possessed in an eminent degree. How comes it then that this unfortunate strategist is now drawn from oblivion, from the idle life which so well suitedhim, to be placed in the most important position of the moment, the last bulwark of Russian power, the key of her capital? Nothing whatever can explain this unexpected act, but it has occasioned considerable alarm in all our circles. " The inhabitants of St. Petersburg have been kept well informed, and the matter is of some interest to them, of the immense preparations made in France and England for next campaign. The theatre of war will evidently be Finland. Now, the Government is by no means.sure of the population, which, by tradition and connexion, holds to Sweden. Germs of discord have been discovered there at various times of a nature to show a wish to quarrel with the Russian population. The prospect of seeing the war transferred to so ungenial a soil is very disagreeable to our Govermment; that of a formidable attak by almost irresistible means throws a gloom over the capital which speaks volumes. It was hoped that the Government, in its foresight, would at least have given to Cronstadt an energetic and skilfil commander; the importance of the position, the dangers which threaten us, the wishes of the country, all made it a duty. But no one thought of Prince Menschikoff, and I can affirm that the Czar, who nominated him, would not have signed the appointment had it not been for the untiring in. fluence which surrounds him and endeavours to compromise him in the eyes of the Russian people. However this may be, here we are under the special protection of Prince Menschikoff, and not only wil he govern Cronstadt, but he wil have all therights, powers, andprivileges reservedto a Commander-in-chief of an army in time of war, and the superior direction of our land and sea forces; now: if the Prince does with our north fleet what he did with our south fleet,-if he sinks it to bar the passage, which is most probable,-we shall not have one ship left. " The nomination of Prince Menschikoff has, moreover, a significance which will escape no one in Europe. He is the promoter of the war, one of the coryphees of the old Russian party; his name therefore means continuation of the war. It is in this point of view, especially, that the choice of the Czar is an unhappy one. " Our conferences continue daily. All men of any note belonging to the army attend them regularly. These councils of war are usually presided over by the Emperor in person. The discussion turns exclusively on the defence of the Russian territory, on the means to be adopted to repel an invasion. This fear of an invasion, which is continually starting up, sufficiently denotes that Russia is not invulnerable, and may be fought on her own ground. The fal of Sebastopol produced a painful feeling hero, and people have not yet quite recovered from the surprise caused by the destruction of that-place by the batteries of the alies. Sebastopol Ws taken, and Cronstadt therefore, it is said may also fall, and, once Cronstadt gone, St. Petersburg is in tlae hands of the allies. The dilemma isa sad one, and bears no cornment. "Will all be done that ought to'be done to spare the Czar the pain of abandoning the city of Peter the Great, and seeking a refuge at Moscow with his family and his Court? loncehopedso;nowIdespairofit. "The eagerness of Count Esterhazy to explain to the Chancellor o£theYEmpirz-the.objot ofhia missonaught to stir up the Russian Government. The reply of Count Xes. selrode tothe peace proposals is hourly expected; nothing has transpired, butis-not the note addressed on-the.d of December to the Russian Ambassadors a reply by anticipation toCountEsterhays note? We wouldfainbelievethe contrary;but, like all men occupied with -politics, we are compelled to say that that circular is the real expression of the sentiments of the Court-that is to say, that the hopes of peace diminish, aud make room for fears inspired by the probability of a continuation of the war. I cannot -bring myself to beiieve that Count Nesselrode's circular is a manifestation meant to be modified, a machine of double action, the object of which would be to cause to be accepted as sufficing some small sacrifices hooked on by our diplomatists to a document which held out no hope of 'any; nor do-I think that Count lNesseiode's object is to gaintime; hostilities are suspended during the winter, and, if Count Esterhazy has not a defnitive answer on the 15th of January, he- wi immediately leave the capital withihe members of his embassy.

THE MfETROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Yesterday, at 12 o'clock, the Metropolitau Board of| Works met again in Burlingccadn-ihouse, P ;y, for the transaction of business. Mr. Thwaites, the president, occupied the chair. There was a full attendance of the mem- ra of the board, and the space assigned in the apartment for the accommodation of the public was again crowded, as on previous occasions. It should be stated that the board, though now fully constituted, and in working order, are scarcely yet in a position to grap3le with the more important public functions which devoive upon them under the act of Parliament by which they are incorporated. The appointment of a multifarious staff of officers for carrying out their requisitions, raid a vast number of other arrangements consequent upon the sudden transfer to them under the statute of the duties and obligations -some of them of great public urgency-of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, now defunct, demand their immediate attention at present, and wi probably occupy it for some little time to come. The minutes of the preceding meeting were read by Mr. Josiah Wilkdnson, the acting honorary secretary, and confirmed. NH.v MEMMERS. The PsRtSms-r reported that Mr. £A . Bristowe,' of Greenwich, andMsr. Charles Harris, of High-street, Southwark, two highly respectable gentlemen, had been returned as members of the board, the former for Greenwich, and the latter for St. Saviours, Southwark, in the room of himself, he having, o'nhis election as president, vacated his seat for those places. Mr. Bnstowe and Mr. Harris delivered in the certificates of their election, and took their seats at the board. On the motion of Mr. Dnxw it was carried by a majority of two that each member be requested to forwrard to the president of the hoard the certifi'cate ofhis election, signed by th chairman of the district meeting at which he was elected, Mr. Lawman Taylor protesting that now, when the board was holding its fourth meetimg, it was a positive loss of time to entertain such a proposition. PROVISIONAL MEASUES3. The Hoa. SECRETARY read a report from the president, made in accordance with a resolution passed by the board at their last meeting, relating the preliminary arrangements which he had since adopt for carrying on the current busineis of the board. It stated that instructions had been given to the chief of the rating department, the colectors and bailiff of the late Commission of Sewers to continue the collection of the rates now in hand, and pay in the proceeds to the account of the provisional treasurer with the London and Westminster Bank llessrm.Smith, the solicitors to the lale commission, had reported the present state of all legal proceedings in which that commission was concerned, from which it did not appear that there were any requirin immediate action. Instruction had been given to the ustrict engineers of the late commission to report the present state of al the works in their several districts, the various existingtcontracts, the amounts already excpended upon themx, teprobable sums required to complete them, and the probable term of completion;- the staff of clerks of wPorks required te sulperintend them; and any other particuLars they might Uthink necessary to convey a just idea of the position of the hoard in reLation to the several contractors. The accountant of the late commission had been instructed to prepareareportonthearrearsof business inhis department an the staf required satisfactorily to complete it. A provisional staff to carry on the current business of the board had been selected from the officers of 'the late commission, to superintend which it had been necessary to appoint a gentleman having a knowled.e of architecture and enr gineermg. together with expeiencein the practical details of the late commision, and at the same time possessing the entire confidence- of the president. The district engineers had beets authorized to engage temporarily the clerks and other persons who had heretofore assisted them. Every ofiicer whose services had been retained had been clearl given to understand that his engagement was provisional, and existed ouly during the pleasure of the hoard It sug gested that arrangements should be made for the present for continuing the payment of the weekly salaries of those ofiicers whose salanes had been hitherto paid in that wa; - thatmotionsintendedttohbe moved at any meetfin of the board should be sent to the president one week before such meeting; and that a small committee should ho appointed to examine and verify the mauimentsand documents banded over to the hoard by the late commission. It also recommended the apjpointment of committees of finance, of conference with district boards, of appeals, for preparing a code of b -laws, and for purposes connected with the Metropolitan uildings Act. Mr. Deputy HARRISoN said if the board were to be asked to adopt that report of the president in its entirety, he was not prepared to accede to all the suggestions it contained. He would mention one with which he entirely disagreed. The board at a previous meeting agreed to aft t temporarily anengineer-in-chief, and to confide to hin the execution and superintendence of al the works the management of which devolved on the board by the act of Parliament by which they were incorporated. But now he understood from the report just read that the president had appointed several persons to do thevery work the whole responsibility of which the board had preiouslyderolved upon Mr. Bazalgette, the engineer-in-chief. (Hear, hear.) Hef asked the president whether he (Mr. Harrison) was right in the interpretation he had put upon that partofthe report. The PRESNgs said his friend would have better understood the question if he had heardthewhole case. The board having delegated to him (the president) certain powrers, it was necessary that he should render an account of the exercise of them. He had asked for no power to transact any of the business of the board, except such as was of a strictly provisional nature, until the staff of the hoard was organized, and so that in the meantime the public service should not suffer. (Hear.) In reply to the question as to whether he had trespassed upon the i authority given to the chief engineer, he would state, for the information of Mr. Deputy Harrison and of the oard, that Mr. Bazalgette, the chief engineer, had applied to him (the president), feelng that the terms of his temorar appointment by the board were not sufficient to enable hni to call on the clerks of works and district engineers to discharge the duties which the board had devolved on them, and asked, him for authority to aail himself of the services of those officers. He (the president), under these circumnI stances, had felt no hesitation in giving Mr. Bazalgette the authority which he required. (Hear.) ge had not further interfered in the matter, and he had ouly interfered so far on the suggestion of Mir. Bazalgette himself. (Hear.) Mrr. Deputy HAIRPSON said he was perfectly satisfied with the excpianation the president had given, and iwith the course he had adopted with reference to the engineer-in- Mr. D'IFFNoGR moved that the report of the president be received and adopted. Mlr. LowmaNTsmLoa said the report might be one which they could unanimously adopt, but before he agreed to its adoption as a whole he should like to consider some of the recommendations contained in it. No harm would be done if the' report was printed and sent to each member of the board before they were called on to adopt it. (Hear.) Mr. Taylor made a motion to that effect, but it was not seconded; and a motion of Mr. Ware, that the report be simply received, was agreedto. A resolution moved by Mr. -Turner, that the measures taken by the president under the authority of the board be approved, vas also passed. Major LYox- moved that the report be printed, contending that it was desirable in this and all future cases that reports made to the board be received and printed, but not discussed on the day on which they were brought up. At the suggestion of M1r. WmnrXsoy, that the recommendations in thereport were not of a nature to justify its being printed, Major Lyon withdrew his motion. The recommendations were then considered seriatim, and agreed to, with modifications in some cases, after a conversation among the members. REPORTS OF OFFICERS. The Hon. Secretary, at the request of the President, read the report of Mr. Bazalgette, the temporary engineer-in-chief to the board. It stated that the board, under the act of Parliament by which they were incorporated, had received from 'the late Commissioners of Sewers the direct management and control over 166 miles of main sewers, partly covered and partly open-namely, 106 miles on the north side of the Thames, and 60 miles on the south side. They had also 27'contractr for newsevwers, nowin the course of construction, transferred to their control, mainly collateral or district sewers in about 200 different roads and streets extending al over the metropolis. Those contracts and works will b comp leted in periods ranging between a fortnight and six months ; but it will require longer time to reinstate the pavements, gas and water mains affected by the operations. To superintend the whole of the abovementioned sewers and to carry on the necessary works he had retained the services of 33 assistants, including clerks of worsandflnshisginpectors, for such time and upon such' conditions as might hereafter be sanctioned by the board. Mr. Haywood for the present continned in charge of that porhion of the mai sewrers which'pased through the city. On the motion of Mr. O TaaaRns the report was re- pdmr. TnoAs Cth n, the elerk of the rates, reported 'that the total Amount' of the rates 'in the several districts was 241,678?. 3a. 2d., of whiceh there had been collected and paidain to the treasurer, up to thxe 31Jt of December, 1555 184,342?. 14s. Id., leaving 57,3354-Id 9.lt, to recover which 'it would be necessary to issue about 25,000 summonses and about 15,000 warrants. (A laugh) - The report was received and adopted, 'and temprr arrangements were sanctioned for continuing the colltion of the rates and the payment of the collectors. The accountant reported that the shortest possible time during.which the accounts of-the late commission, in his department, could be completed was a month, and the cost would be. aboht 66!.. The report was received and adopted. THE DEVICE O THE CODIONs SEAL OF THE BOAD. The report of tbe'committee appoimtd at the last inreting to consider and report upon an appropriate device for the common seal of the boara was brought up and read. They recommnended that there should be two seals-first, a large' one, with which to seal all deeds and official docaments emanatirg from the board, and a snaller one, to be used in their official correspondence; that on the large seal should. be engraverithe Royal armn' surrounded by-the arnotlal bziangs of the four metropolitan counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Essex, and Kent, and of 'the cities of Loudon and Westminsker,wvithth6 inscription "The Mfetropolitan Board of Worl&i;`"and that the smaller one shouldbeengravod wtith the armns of the four metropolitancountieaenly, and a similar inscription.-: 'Mr. IowAne TAYLOR; seconded by Mr. DALTON, moved the adoption of the report of the commnittee. <Mu TURNER said he conlsideredit important that they .should have a inott,ootitheir uionime sEal indicative of the princinle under which they were embodied and of thote on vicicthe wheve grgto at, indby which th4 wouldbe ad-' ronishep Theneer they wert disposed to depart from those ,Trinciples. They were ,coontituted on the principle bf populai election 'in the first ylace, and, in the second, to carry out in good order that which had-hieret6fore'eii carTied on in -an unsatisfactory and desultoryway. The reeglt 'aimed atwas strength He would move " ThAt the moMo onLUie&seai be ' Li&t order, aid'strmgh '(A laugh, and The motion was not seconded. Major Lyos moved, as an amendment, that theI should adopl the rie nerattio.a of the czwUinttit wit respect to the large seal, without troubling themselves with any such motto as " Liberty, equality, and fraternity." (A I,r) LowmAx TALOPR protested against the unnecessary waste of their time by such a discussion. The committeO had hit upon a very suitable device, in recommending that the arms of the counties and dties over which the Board of Works had jurisdiction should be quartered on their cosgmon seal; and let the board adopt that recommendation at once. (Hear, hear.) The amendment of Major Lyon was put and lost, and the motion of Mr. Taylor, adoptingthe report of the committee, was carried. On the motion of Mr. SAVAOE, seconded by Mr. WAxRE, it was resolved that there be but one device on both seals. At this point a letter was read by the President from lMr. Wyon, the engraver, enclosing tw-o rough sketches of a device for the seal In one he state hie had sought to represent "the Metropolisin consultattion with Science. The figre intended to personify the Metropolis, including the adjacent districts, ad by her side a shield, on which the arms of the cities and counties of the district over which her jurrsdiction extended were depicted * and the figure of Science submitted for consideration a plan of some works, the wheel, pickaxe, &c., denoting that it was engineerin' science that was intended." In the other sketch he states he had sought to treat the subject heraldicaRy. He added that he found on inquiry that the counties of Surrey and Essex had no armorial bearings (a laugh), but those of Guildford and Colchester, their chief tiowns, might be used. Mr. SEELYra moved " That, inasmuch as Mr. Wyon hal thrown new light on the subject, in reference to thera being no armorial bearings for Surrey and Essex, the guestione oremitted backto the committee for reconsideratlon." The motion was seconded by Mfr. L. TAYLOr, and carried. DUTIES AND SALARIES OF OFFICERS. The report of the committee appointed at the last meetinto consider and report upon the duties and salaries of the engineer-in-chief, the clerk or. secretary, the treasurer, accountant, and superintending irhcltect, was next read. It described in detail, except in the case of the architect, the duties of the several officers, and reconunended, with some exceptions, that they should be required to devote their whole time and attention to the services of the board; tha' the clerk's salary should,be 8001. a-year, but that, with regara to the salaries of the engineer-in-chief, the accountant, and superintending architect, they required further time for considieration. They also recommended that one of the .jointstock banks carrying on business in the metropols be appointed treasurer, and that the committee sho be authorized to communicate with the several joint-stock banks to ascertain the terms on which they would be disposed to acecpt the office. The PBnXSIDENT, in reply to Major Lyon, said the clerk would be required to advise the board on all legal points arisingduring their discussions whenever necessary; but hey would appoint a solicitor, to whom they would refer in THIs OLER'S SALARY. MIr. Deputy HARRISoN said, as to the clerk to the board, the committee, of whom he was one, gave the subject a great deal of consideration, and it vas in the minds of all of them that the gentleman appointed to that office should be one whose mind had received a leg%al training, although they did not say whether he should be a barrister or a soliciter. There would be constantly questions arising before the board as to the construction of the acts of Parliament under which they would operate, and it was very material that they should have :gentleman on the right of the 'resident who would be ablegenerally to advise him and the board on all such occasions That was the view the committeetook, and they found also that there was scarcely an instance in which a law man had not been appointed to dischargesimilarduties. As tothe salary of 800., the corn. mittee did not desire to establish this appointment at an unnecessarily large annual remuneration. They knew that 800L had secured the services of the gentleman who had acted as secretary to the late commission, and they thought it would remunerate the gentleman who shouldbe appointed the clerk of this board for the duties he would have to dmsebar'e (Hear.) Theydid not,therefore,feelthemselves just=iem giving a larger salary than was give by the commisston which had been superseded by the present board. The committee had unanimously agreed to that recommendation,andhe movedthatthe boardwouldagree to their recommendation. Mfr. Rows reminded M1r. Deputy Harrison that the secretaryto the Commssion of Sewers had 1001. added to his salary, in consideration of relinquishing some of his apartments for the use of the commission. M1r. HARRIson believed that was so. The PRsmENTr, in answer to Mr. Davis, said the clerk wouldhave no power to appoint his subordinate officers The would beappointed by the board. Mr. D,AVIS was sorryto hear it, inasmuch as a deal of their valuable time would be thereby frittered away. The motion, adopting the recommendationthat the clerk's salary be 8001., was then agreed to, as were also the other recommendations of the committee seriatin, after a short conversation. Mr. LowsA-4A. TAYLORt urged upon the board to appoint the clerk with the least po;sile delay. NEW BUILDINOS AISD STRFEra Major LYON moved that it be a regulation to be observed forthwsthmi the erection of new buildings and strets that no street shall be constructed of a less width than 40 feet, and no alley of aless Iwidth than 10 feet. He explained that he had reason to apprehend that in several parts of the metropolis buildings and streets were being erected in a manner which would be detrimnental to the health of the inhabitants; and the builders were pressing them forward durag the present transition state of the executive body and the law, in the hope that they would not afterwards be called on to alter their plans. The motion was seconded by 3Mr. CR L'OERS. Mfr. CoLWrNSoN, objectedl to an abstract proposition like that being entertained by the board at present, and aoved that the question be referred to the committee on by-laws. A short discussion ensued, in which air. HowS, Mr. Deputy HARRnisoN, and other members took part, and which resulted inthe motion of Major Lyon being lost, and in his giving notice that he would renew it at the next meeting. Mr. DIxon hoped it vould go forth to the world, for the information of persons buildiig houses in contravention of the lav, that ths board had extensive powers to remove nuisances of all kinds, and that they wouldexercise them in all such cases. (Hear, hear.) - XLECMION OF CLERK TO TRE BOARRD. On the motion of M1r. L. TAYLOR, secondedl by Mrr. DOULTON, it was resolved that the board, at its rising, ad. journ to Mfonday next, at 12 o'clock, and then Proceed with the election of the secretary or clerlk to the board; and, On the motion of Mr. CoraJsox an advertisement was directed to be iseted in the daily Pa'pers, settigforth the duties and saryof the clerk, and the time up to which ap. plications wouwald be received by the board from gentlemen: desirous of becoming candidates for the office. A conversation, originated by Mr. HAEUwES, then tooki pace with reference to the place of mneeting of the beard after the 21st inst., when Burlington-hiouse would be rIquired for the use of the Goversnment, in wliceh the PnmSi)ENST, Mr. NiciOoLAY, Major LYON, and M1r. DAvis oined, the latter gentleman. who represents the district of uanisoead, causing some laughter by saying there ws a handsome room on Plumstead-common which might be at the service of the board. A short discuscion also arose on the motion of Mr. D'Ianger to refer the consideration of the applications for the clerkshi to a committee, to meet on Saturday, with power to reouce the number of applicants to six, to whom the choice of the board should ultimately be limited. Several members, including Mrr. Collinson and others, objected to the proposition, as tending to abrogate the main functions of the beard in so important a matter as the choice of their clerk, and it was negatived on a show of hands. The board then adjourned until Monday next, at 1. o'cock.
RErOsiLiATORY ScHooLs FOR CRsWAiS.-At a recent meeting of the magistrates of the county of Surrey a committee was appointed to consider the best means of establishing reformiatory schools in the county for juvenile criminals. The result has been a report from the committee for, the consideration of the justices at the next quarter sesidons, in which the committee give an opinion that the means available for the reformation of juvenile offenders in the county are entirely inadequate, and they recomrnend that reformatory schools should be established.

I JUVENILE CRMINAL9. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIhES. Sir,-I beg to enclosea copy of the -circLar issued bythe committee of the proposed Manchester and Salford Refonna. tory on Friday, the principles advocated in which are so imuch in acoordance 'with those in your leading ricle of that day that possibly you may deem some extracts from it worthy a place in your columns. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. EDWAXD HARDECASTL. I M Xa=hester, JaT. 5. "PnROPOSup MANCHESIMS A- SALFOPD REFOM&TOIy FOR JUVEscrnZ CrEMiNALS. The zeformationof juvenile criminai ss a subject attract. ing such general attention throughout the country that it cannot be regarded with indifference in Manchester; and the committee of the Angel 3eadow and Ancoats Ragged and Beformatory School are assured that it is only neces. sary for them to make more widely known the present position of their institation,, and the uargent necessity wlfich exists for an ininediate and considerable extension of its operatons, to seciur a large and liberal measure of support for ther pronsed undrtupon you rlads resgesed unars for the district, the coamittee did notcontem te the admission of children v,ho had been actually committed to prison, except in very peculiar cases. Bt is not, howrever, too much to affirm, that the reception of a far larger number than they had at first intended was absolutely forced upon them by circumstances which were constantly presenting themselves to their noece. Case after case was b rought before them of young lads released from the gaols, earnestly desirous of reformation, but having no means of escape from their former associates, no hope of obtamninghsonest employment, and no prospect but of atspeedyretburn to the pfrisn from which they had just emerged, to be aginm let loose upon society more hardened and desperate than before. " The committee art e eee to confess that the numrber o such instances yas so great, and the altrnative open to the I a tpli if admission whs refused them, so fearfl, l tbal they were led, almost insensibly, to adnit more than the premises were fiteid to accommodate. Fresh anplicationsp however, were contenually made, and the necessaty for an enlargement of the establishment and for its removal from the town woas so strongly felt by them, tat they soere taking sdepd for brnging the circumstances of the d istte - tion before the public when the sudden death of the master from fever, and the neessity for the immediate removal of the inmates, placed them in a position of exrele difficlty and anxiety, and delayed the execution of their intention. " eAt this jnctre they received the veryaliberalloffer from Mr. Fitz Gerald, of an acre of land near Pendieton, as fhe site for a new building; and a subscription of 150L pet annum, for three years, for the salary of a first-rate master upon the only conditions, that the institution should be cwholly reformator (not a ragged and reformatory school camblned)rand that it should he placed at a distance from the town. "eThe committee are most anti ions immediately to accept Mr. Fitz Gerald's proposal; and they earnestly appeal to their fellows-citizens for support5 in the confident hope that his enerous offer will be as lberally responded to. "n thont entering uponh leng,thened argment imfavour of juvenile reformatores, the committee can atfirm that, short as their own experience has been, they have abandant evidence of the exis of the first great element of saue cner-a desire for refounation on the bart of the offender; and, they may add, of the practicability of effecting that Ieformation, "h rg then Smon s in which the 3ayes-street estabvichment hasibeen in operation, no less than 88convicted criminals, between theages of 12 and 18, have applied for admission, besides 15 who had been apprehended, though not convicted; and this notw;ithstnding the discouragement rof constant refusals, in consequence of the deplorable inadequacyof the accommodation, S7 only havingobhined admission. The time has been too short to admut of any large number hbeo' placed out in life, hut of the 16 boys who have been ofschargmi from the institation six were convictedi riminalsb all of whom, so far as they have been heard of, are doing well. " The committee would spezially refer to the accompanying report5, which has been prepared at their request by the treasurer, for full detils of the working of the criz,inap2art of the inustitution in Angel Mfeadowv. " The extent of juvenile crime in Wanchester and the neighbourhood will be seen by reference to the reports of the chaplains of the twvo eaols of the tow. It appear.s thit the number of committa,s to the mew Bailey i the year ending September 29, 1855, was 547 males under 17 years of age; showingalarge increase, the number havinz been 478 in 1854, and only 355 in 1853. In the City Gaol tbe number for the two years 18 i4 and 1855 is the same-viz., 32Z in each year hnbut asat is incldes 54 recomamittals in 1855 against 58 in 1854, the number of inditiduals committed iw 1IS3 was 273, against 269 in 185at Of which 22 were under 12years, 61 between 12 Tnd 14, and 190 between 14 and 17 years of ane. " But wcoilnthe increase of crime has led within the last few years to a'vast expense in the erection of the nezw city gaol, ad vhile aready itmis fonnd necessary to expend at ea*a 24.000L upon the enlar"ement of that building, no effort, beyond the very linited~ one in A^ngel Meadow,- has lean made for the reformation of the offenders. " Althongh deeply impressed with the necessity for reformatory institutions, and convainced of the benefit3 which hatversu ated from themr, the committee feel that they ought not to pass over altogether without notce the only serious objection whEich they have heard made to them-the objection, namely, that their very success affords a prenium for crime. They conceive that tiis objection refers more to the manner in which these institutions may be conducted than to the prindiples pon which they are based, for, as it canot be denied that therse is averylarge and inoreasing class of juvenile delinaerats growing up in all our great tows to the serious peril of the commpaty, it will scarcely be asserted that no attempt of any kind should be made to reform them. The danger is, lest too much should be done. "aThe committee ae fully alive to this danger, and they desire to state at the ontset their intention to uard against it, by preserving the ntmot plainess and simpliity in the arrangement of the builhdns and in the dress and dietary of the inmates; to maisntai a strict hut knd disipline; to nsist upon regularity and industry; and at the same btme to afford no high degree of education, beyond reading, writing and cpherng anning at an improvement of the character by a careful, moral, and religious trainingr and then impart o chndustrial instruction as may be to . cient for obtaing an honest livelihooadi but not to confer superior advanta esto t hose usally enjoyed by children of the working clases. The amount of instruction necessary to this end will of course nary accordg to the circum styances of the individual; much less being required, for instance, to fit a lad for a soldier or a saior than for a tailor or a shoslker; but, as a general principle, they believe that dhe most simple and inexpensive education, compatible with effiiency, will be, under the peculiar circumstances, that ^xhich it is mos desirable to impart. "As regard3 the cases which should be considered eligible fcr admission, the comittee are decdedly of opnion that it is undesirable to lay dowIn a rule mading prenrous conviction a necessary qualification. A slight acquaitance with bhat may be called the riminal populationmof large towns wl suffice to show that the ditinction between conviction and non-conviction is little more than that between detec1lion and impunity. Boystramed by the same masters and li" by the same dishonest practices mnst be dealt pith as one cliass and fheyuannot conceive that, in the byno means improbable case of- two such lads, inmates, perhaps, of the iname hose, ain ke desirouns of amendment, and differin enly in the fact of conviction, it will be maintainea to be desirable, th the one should be acnitted and the other rejected, until, by a retrn to cre, he procares, in the sentence of the magisrate, the passpot to- the desired asylum. It i s of the utmos importance that each case should be considered upon its merits and decidedmby the discretion of the committee. "It is necesry.to sketch the main features of the plan which it iS proposed to adopt. "It is desired, if the finds will admit, toremore the idstitution to a greater distance from the town than the site kindly offered by Mr. Fiitz Gerald, but still to retain it in a locality easily ascessible; It is also desiredto secure at least five acres of laud, much importance being attached to agricultural labour as affording the most complete change to anythmg the inmates are ikey to have beenaccustiomed to. Instruction will, however, be oiven in useful trades, as shoemakine carpentering, tcci "aTe system of distributing the inmates among separate dwelngs lsa beenrfond to work betterthanthat of collecting them inl one arge building, as by this arrement a more ready supervision and control can be exercised by the sPlperintendent, greater facilities are afforded for clannficaticn, anl the risk lessened of the contaminati of ad example, which always spreads itself most rapidly among 'amge numbers. *-It is proposed, in the first instance, to erect one such buildin",tconsisting of a residence for the master, with accommodation for 35 or 40bhoys,ceomprisin- sleeping wvards, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, &e.A fhe schoolroom, woririhope, &c., will be separate, and7designel for there (eptaon of a considerably larger number; butait will not be necessary to complete themto the full extent until the funds admfit of an increase in thenumberofinmlates. By this nrcans the exctension of the establishment will bce rendered easy, as, when necessary, another boardmng lhosse might be treeted, entirely distinct and complete in itself, to be placed under the management of a subordinate of ficer. " The committee intend that all the dostic work, incdang cooking, shouild 'ce performed by the boys themselves, as-tending to render them- completely independent and bandy, and fitting them especially for emigration, or for the sea,.to which they look as the desiation of a lar"e number, con sidering thestrict discipline of the navy likely to be peculiarly beneficial. --- " They propose, at least for the prsent, to retain the' premises in-hlayes-sreet (of which they have an unexiredl lease for-two years), the 'voluntary appEvation of so large a. umlber of cruims from the locaaityyresentino astrs@ yroof ofthenecessity for some establistment easily acces: sible at all times to those anxtious to c9cape~ rtinteiraaoil associates.

THE BAK OF ENGLAMD. .l TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TES a Sir,-31r. Tooke, in a late pamphlet on the Bankihairer Act of 1844, just published, stigmatizes -the EInk of England, as at present managed, as a public masance. I ha¶ve heard the sine epithet applied to your-ul Perhaps a fellow feeling may induce yanto consideriihether Mr. Toole's attack is really-warranted, and, if yopi4do not agree with bim, I venture to ask youtolook fairl at the position in which the Bank of England is placed,nd to use your aid in endeavouring to clear asry somGeof the mystery which now appears to hang over its opeiStions, particularly with reference to the act of 184. Mr. Tooke assumes itWas a fact that the circuati6nofo -the country consists of Bank deposits, Bank credits, bills of exchange, and of all the other various modes af econoinizing the use of coin, and for faiEitatingthe transfer of propertyto an equal degree with that portion of the cirulatibn commonly called banknotes. 2Now, under this asumption, it would appear to be a natural consequence, that if it were desirable to impose any restLiction by legislative enaament on the circulation, such restriction ought to apply indiscri. minately to every medium by which the transfer of'property in this country is thus facilitated. Sir lobert Peel, however, did not talke this view-,f the question, as he considered it unneesy to interfere with any other kind of circulation than that of banknotes; but it does not appear from any public6 xpres. sion of opinion (thorugh assumed by 31r. Tooke) that Sir Robert Peel was ignorant of the influence ovriprice3 caused by the other various modes of arrangig and kttling accornts besides banknotes, though he considered that the great object he had in view (viz., of preventing, umder any possible circumstances, the depreciation of the mediumui most extensively used as a substitute for coin of knsown value), would be effectually obtained by placing such restriction on the issue of banknote3 as would at all times insu4er their perfect identity of value with that which they professed to represent-viz, a certain quantity of gold of known weight and quality. It appears to me that this object has been attained, and if, in effecting it, the sacrifice entailed 'on the country by a certin quantity of gold being occasionaiy rendered useless for the ordinary commercal demands .f the country is considered too great a,burden, let -the whole sub. ject be reconsidered: but there is no necessity for throwing on the Directors of the Bank of England the responsibility of deciding how much gold is required to be kept in reserve for the purpese of maintaining theintegrityof the no6esthey are allowed to issue. Some Government departmeTntCmight be easily made use of as an ofEce for exchanging gold for notes, and notes for gold. If, bythe removal of thias business from the Bauk of England, the proprietors of Banrk Stock are the losers of 100,0001. n-year--which they are said to derivefrom its transaction-theymay settle accounts with Mr. Tooke and those who adopt his views for havinig deprived them of so much profit. The Directors of the Bank of England can have no object in desiring the change, be5ond the satisfaction of being relieved from a source of alleged grievance, with which they have no sort of necessary counexion. The second grave charge brought against the Ba:nk of England by Mr. Tooke is, that in the employment of4a portion of the large deposits placed under their charge, in dis. couting bills, they are constantly varying the rate. It appears to me that xr. Tooke might just as well complain of dealers in Government stocks or annuities for not maintain. ing an uniformity of price in the article in which they deaL The rate of discount, or the immediate value of a deferred payment, is regulated as is the price of every other article, by the sapply and demand. The Banlk of England,'as larga employers of capital, have certainly considerable poier of temporarily influencing the value of an article in -hich they are frequently able to deal largely ; but this power is only temporary. Mr. Tooke approves of Mr. Wilson's defimition of sound banking "as the employment of thse resources of a bank at the greatest profit with referenLe to prudence, looking to its reserve." Now, when the-ataount deposited at the Bank of England is unusually largd, they 3must either keep an unusual amount of these depositseunem. ployed, at the risk of loss to their proprietary, or they must consent to lend it at the current rates of interest. To lend it it such periods for long dates, or to buy secutities it current high prices, may entail), in one case, an inconvemient lock-up of money when these deposits may be required to beavailable;or,in the other, aloss of capital if itbereruired to realize at aperiod of pressure stocks bought at a jeriod of abundance of money. To lay out their deposits,therefore, at such moments in hills of exchange rather than in investments of a more permanent character appears to me to comply with MIr. Wlilson7s definition of sound baniEng; but, todothis, they must undoubtedly be ready to d&count bills at whatever may be the current rate of the value of capital of such description seeldng employment at that moment. Whenerertheyact otherwise, either by maintLining arateabDovethe market price, or by reducing their rate below the market price, they in one case neglect the interest of their proprietors and of the public, by locking up laoney which could be beneficially brought into more general use; or, in the other, expose themselves to the risk of having too large an amount of their capital, which ought to be 'available, locked up in securities not falling due as rapidlygasthe demands of their customers may come uponthem; in-either case acting on Tunsound banking principles. J will not enter into the discussion as to the mode ;of the appointment of the chairman by the directors, or of the mode of transacting business at the board. I entirely agree with Mr. Tooke in two of his remarks on this part -of his subject:-first, that the present Governor has been well selected; and next, that the existing arrangement by which one-third of the directors leave the board every yedr, for re. election on the next ensuing April, is absurd and mischievous. The sooner the latter arrangement is done away with, the better for the efficiency of the Directors .of the Bank of Englnd. I am. Sir. Your most obedient sern-ant ALONDON MXRCRANT. London, Jan. 7.

Every enlightened mind--every mind, indeed, above thelowes;tgrade--feetea pure gratideaition ini learning something of the progress that is going forward in other branches of industry than that inwhichheismore immediately concerned; for not onlydo all branches of industry grow out of a common stock,but they are ali so intimately interwoven chat discovery eaanot widen the spread of any one brsch without all the others acquiring additional vigur if nten largement. Nodiscovery ofscience is baren; every a cextnds therangeof thought, kindlesnewaspirations, and adds something to theralue of avilized life. The history of the industrial sciences is indeed, one long Illustration ofthisf.ct. But if "knowledge ispower."andimprovemqent and pro- p~thez corollary of knowledge, its equaly true that it is mainly by the diffusion of knowledge that new kowiedge is evolvred. It isin this conviction that we rest our confidence that we found ouxhopethat a publication which shall faithfully exhibit and popularize those kindtof knowledge on which industrial development and adaptation =amanldpe -which shallby precept and example affordl means for invesigton and comparison not Litherto atiainable,which shall faihfll recordI what is dLone and discovered, what improvements are maade, and what fallacies are exptoded,--such a publication may, it is Presumed, well claim to be reganded itself among the aids to advancement. And in astate ofthe arts when allthe elements are rendered subservient to the sober industries of peace and civiliztion and the reseurces of war and destruction,-when the great burden ofLAiad work and mianipulation is tuLrned over upon the iron hand and fingem of machinery, which we have taught to dgnd draw water for us, to cary fr u. nd ow nd ea, ad in a-nd bake for us; which we have taughtto spini, weave, knit. and sew, forge and blow, headp ins, cut files,.weld and rivet, make roads, and travers the ocean asahig way; which goesgtofight and tofis,hwith us, draws from the bowels of the earth itsrownelementand the materias for its reproduction; and this whetnwe have taught iron to float.and whent we construct sipds of it a valetudinarian journey in Iength, and supplied with automatic organs of locomotion no less gigantic and not less wonderful for beauty of adlaptation than for miagnitude and power; when we employ wind and water as a power and a.pathway, make the tides to work forvts apply heat to convert. dlay into stone, and stonle into metal, and IiZth mnto glass; when we employ it as a, labenring force and2as n agent of domestic comfort ; when we pave and light our streets-and luricate machinery with the productsof coat; when magnietistriguides us on thieocean and inthe wildemness; when electricity Cannes cMr messages withi the velocity of thoungh.t, and writes them if wewil; when steam prints ferns andthe snlight paints ferns; and when. ta fact only the rainbow and the aurora borealis are unapprolpriated to some purpose of utility or convenience1 there iscertainly no want ofrscope for ourexertions: and these we are prepared to put forth ingooid faith and condidence. Although industrial progress in a healthy stale of society is as inpitable an the lapse of timne, it may yet be facilitated ; and certainly iLnnomoro sure way than by the publication of all new facts as they spring up, and their tree andI isgpsrtial discussion. In this way we hope to engage more and more of the practical intellect of the country in the cultivation of the industrial sciences We say '" industria sceneces," for it is not technical experience that we now stand in need of. Ourt-arts are in that advanced state that they can. be advanced mainly by discovery of'new combinations of the principles involved, or by the elimsination of errors. There is a science of the application -of science, and one of no miner importance. The principless of physics ame very completely emnbodied ins many theoretical -works of moderate bulk; but they would remain only beautiful theories for eloset exercise, but for the Ecdenceoro application which has rendered them available to the purposes of life. There is a logic in this of as high an on(ler as that by which the ipure truths were in the finst instance evolved. There is aIso another science concerned, subsidir indeed, but not unimportant-the science of exposition. This is the dpartment which we undertake to exemplify in the pages of "The Engineer." andnot without some considerable experience of ist rules anid requirements. We especially hope for the support of those engaged actively in in dustrialkpinsuits. It in to the intelIUgence and energy of the workman class; that the healtby and rapidly-advancing state of our materia civilization is in great part due; to them we owe many of those happy applications which have proved thec inert fruitful in. the arts. It is, indleed, necessarily so, not accidentally. Mental andI mn=ual dexterity areassociated in e-eryproductireresut;,it is totheir ii,rmncosinm--operation that all-our reat conquests over the Dowero of nature, all those triumphs of skIlland feats of ingenuity. of whichL *we are so justly proud, are to bo referred.

Much of our industrial progress is fairlyatteibutable to the increased and increasing cultivation of the artisan. And at a time whent we are opening Trades' schools," eivingprize for proflcleary in knowledge of common things coinferring " county honours," and " county degrees"I for educational proficiency, it is not a question whethier higher intellectual cultivation of the artisan wil not be attended with advantage to the developmnent of the arts in which he is engaged.

Such a succesEful result within the same space of time the directors believe to be without precedent in the records of life ssurance offices In detailig thetransactionsof the office in the yearjutd losed it is highly satisfactory to report that, notwithstanding the financal pressure of a sftate of waron many classes of the commumity, no les than -35 proposals for assurane have been° submitted to the board wthin the last 2 months, of which 1,073 have been aooepted, and po'cies thereonissued forwasuring the sumof £59,449. The annual premstums ontheseamoumtto£18,445 s.6d. From these figures it wilbe seen that, although the number of policiesissued thisyearislessthan the preceding, yet it is satisfactory to find that theaverage amount of the sums aasured is considerably higher; consequently it appears that the deiency in te number of assurances is principal confined to the class of smal asu s. thile regretng, on their accountt that the cicumstmane of the tfmes should preFson them so he viofasto prevent their availing theTselves of the beet this ODice affords, e Directors thin itright toa te8thatthese o casionaln luctuaftons in the Yearly issue of powmoes in no degree affect te prosperous position of the mnstitution.

The capitol has now grown to £l,425,f00, and, I fear, has not yet done growing. The Directors yertelay admsitted the principle of my plan for educingthe capital by the iesse of life tickets, and the payment of thfose tickets in shares of the company, and have so frameda clause in the bi nowbeforehfarlaamenc. The thin endofthe wedge is therefore happily in, and,if you desire it to be drivenhome. you mstbe extremely m spect in exercising your priSlege in voting I wi endeavour to seistyoin the matter by sounding a note of WIruru in time r.onIlddesmis ethe personal friend of Mr. Andeson, who is opposed tothereductionofcapitalbylifetickets, whether paid for in money or in shares - and, moreoTer, Mr. lonides hiMsef ba confesed to me that he shali vote against it Air. Etches resides at Derby and is therefore unable to attend to the duties, and he very properly admitted at the meeting that in consequence of the distance he residedfrom Loudonhe was an unnitperson to become a director. Mr. leal'e isperhaps one of the best men that could be foumd for the office, if he had timeand health to attendto its duties. Mr. Beale explained to the Committee in my presencoe that he had neither health nor time to attend to any more public undertakings, and beged to be excused from serving as a Director. hr. Dauby Seymour isn-imown to me, but, as he was nominated by the Directors, I aball not vote for him n rtil I am asnred that he wmf sgpport the best pomible plan for reducink thecapital bythe transferof sbares or the Wale of life tickets. If we succeed now in eatingmen who wl adopt the best plan for the reduction of capital, we may expect to see our property improve considerably. , on the contry we elect four Directorwoare unilling t° cury out such a measure, there in veiy little doutbt that ou'r shares wil be very much more depressed than they are *t thepDresent time.

CENTRAL eBMrI.AL COUR2, 3foroAdy, rJan.7. The January sessions of the Central Criminal Court was opened this morning before the RightHon. David Salomons, Lord Mayor, the Rigtht Hon. J. A. S. Wortley, MP., Recorder, Aldermeh Farebrother, Farucomb, Sir F. G. Mfoon, Sir II W. Carden, and Marc,. E L: H; Kennedy and Mr. W. A. RBose, Sheriffs; Mr. J. A. Bose, Under. Sheri rc.- -The names of 65 prisoners are contained in the first editiox of the calendar. The RECOssnn, in his charge to the grand jmuy, aid that in point of numbers the calendar was undoubtedly light, but he regretted very much to see that there were five persons on the calendir charged with the crime of wilfulmur. der, and itappeared that, unhappily, for several consecutive sessions there had been charges of the same Idndtobe disposed of. Two of the casesnow for trial were already standingover from a former session, and there were two fresh cases that would have to be tried if they should find the bills. The first of these cases was that of anunhappy man named Cor. zigan, who was charged with the murder of his wife under very shocldng circumstances. It was not necessary that he should detain them by any observations in reference to this case, because it did not appear to present any legal difficulties; and he was afraid that if the evidence that would be laid before them was anything like what appeared in the depositions they would have no alternative but to return a bill for wilful murder against the prisoner. There appeared to bo no doubt that the act Was committed while the prisoner was under the excitement of intoxication, and that his mind was affected in consequence of his having been drinking to excess for several days be. fore the unfortunate occurrence, but this was no answer or excuse whatever in point of law; nothing butthe total depri. vation of reason could be alleged asan answer ; and the fact that a crime was committed while the party accesed was in a state of excitement from drink was no exeuse whatever in law. There was another very painful case, in which a man named Harvey and a woman named Ray, who ap. peared to have cohabited together and who passed 2s man and wife, butwho were-in reality not married, were charged wiith the murder of two of the children of the former prisoner in a most cruel manner-namely, by starvation. It a peared that Harvey had four children by his wife, and that after her death the female prisoner lived with him as hiswife, and there seemed to be no doubt that the deaths of two of these children were occasioned by actual starvation and want of sustenance. The case was somewhat singular; but if it were made out to the satisfaction of the grandjur that both the prisoners had withheld food from the children, contemplating death as the result, there was no doubt in law that this would be murder in both, notwithstanding the relation in which they stood to each other; and if that fact were made out, it would, therefore, be their duty to find the bilL If this were not, however, established in a satisfactory manner, the prisoners would still be amenableto the charge of manlaughter. The law cast upon a parent, in the first instance, the duty of maintaining his-offspring; and if he neglected that duty, and bygross neglect and inattention death was occasioned, he woDld, in such a case, be gailty of manslaughter. A wife would notbe liableundersuch circum.- stances, unless itwas shown that the husband had supplied her with the prop means to provide sufficient sustenance, and that she wilfully neglected to make use of those means. The female prisoner in this case, however, did not stand in the position of a wife ; and therefore, if the grand jury should think, from the evidence, that it was made out that she undertook to look after the children, and that shhe gzossly neglected that duty, although, perhaps, not with any eliberate intention to cause their death, she would still be liable to a charge of manslaughter. If, therefore, they should not think the evidence safficient to support the charge of wilful murder, and the fact should appear as he had suggested, theywould then be justified in returning abill for manslaughter against both prisoners. There was another case of a similar kind, in which a man named Butler and his wife were charged with causing the death of one of their children. In this case it appeared tohim that the child had died without any manifest cause, and the evidence as to the cause of death appeared to hin to be very indistinct. There appeared to ho some evidence of slight violence having been used by the mother towards the deceased child, and also that on the' night previous to its death the child had been exposed to the cold. These appeared to be the principal facts in support of the prosecution, and if the grand jury should think that there was sufficient evidence of the exposure and the violence to caR upon the prisoners for an answer, in that case it would be their duty to find the bill against them. There was another case to which he considered it necessary to allude briefy in which the prisoner was chargedwith manslaughter. ft appeared in this case that the prisoner was the keeperof a beershop, and thatin the course of a scuffle between him and the deceased, who had been drinkig, and whom he was desirous to remove from his house, the latter fel down and died almost imnmediately It appeared, however, that he was suffering from disease of the heart, and that the medical men had told him previously that it was probable he would some day drop down dead and that any excitement would be very iely to produce such a result. If they should, therefore, be of opinion that the death was merely the result of excitement, the prisoner would not be liable to be tried for manslaughter; and, unless they should think that- the death had been accelerated by same act of the prisoner, they ought not to find the bilL The grand jury theen retired, and the Court proceeded to disp oe of the business of the session. Mr. BALLArrnqE made an application in reference to the case of Joseph Berridge, who preaded guilty a few sessions back to an indictment charging him with sending a letter threatening to murder a gentleman named Brown. The circumstauces of this case, it will be remembered, were of a very extraordinary character. The prosecator of the indictment was the Rev. Mir. Brown, the rector of the parish of Letheringsett, in Norfolk The prisoner, who is a highly respectable man, considerably advancedin life, had, many years ago, been on intimate terms with the prose. cutor, but for several years they had been separated, the prosecutor living at Letheringsett, in the performance of iS religious duties, and the prisoner living la London. It F appeared, however, that for a considerable time an extrordinary delusion had entered into the mind of the prisoner, and for which, it should be .stated, it appeared to be most distinctly established there was not the slightest foundation, that his wife had been unfaithful with the prosecutor. Under the influence of this delusion it appeared that-he had written a number of letters to the rev. prosecutor, in which he distinctly charged him with having seduced his wife, and threatened to murder him; and in one of the letters he declared he would take the life of the prosecutor while he was in the pulpit For a considerable time it appeared that the prosecutor took no notice of these letters, but shortly after the ne referred to had been received the prisoner was seen to enter the church at Letheringsett just as the prosecutor was about to commence his duty with a carpet-hag in his hand, and, his conduct tending to create a belief that he intended to commit some act of violence, he was taken into custody. Inquiries were then nade, and it turned out that the bag he had with him did not belong to him, but he had brought it by mistake from the inn, and upon his own agbeing opened it was found to contain a 31ini pistol, loaded with ball, and in the prisoner's pockets there were several percussion caps. Under these circumstances the prisoner was indicted for the offence above stated, and he pleaded guilty to the charge before Mr. Justice Erle, the judge who presided on the occasion. All the facts were laid before the Court, and it was stated that the prisonerwas a man of great intelligence andinare. spectable position, and there appeared to be no doubt that upon the subject referred to he was decidedly insane and that nothing could induce him to believe that the impression upon his mind of the infidelity of his wife was a delusion. The yrisoner, in the end, gave a positive pledge that he would not annoy-the prosecutor in any way in fture, and the learned judge being unwiling, under the circumstances, to restrain his Eliberty, consented to his being discharged -upon his finding bail for his good behaviour and for his appearing to receive judgment if he should be called upon to 3fr. BALLArNTiN7Enow stated thathe regrettedthe humane course adopted by the learned judge had not had the desired effect, but that since the former proceeding the prisoner had not only written threatening letters to the committing ma, strate, but had also sent communications to the Rev. Mr Brown that were of such a nature that he feared for his personal safety, and notice had therefore been given to the ail to surrender the prisoner according to the conditions of their recognizances, and he was now in attendance, and his application to the Court was, upon the affidavits and papers he should put in, that the prisoner be cormmitted to custody until a communication should be made to Mr. Justice Erie in reference to the matter. The RECOuDxxB, having perused the documents that were handed to hmn by the learned counsel, said he thought there were q3ite sufficient grounds to justify him in ordering the detention of the prisoner. - Mr. BAL.Nr-M said that the prosecutor reallv considered that his lfe was in danger, and, although there was no doubt that the prisoner was perfectly sane upon every other point than the one in question, and wax besides a very respectablerman, yetthere seemed to be no otheF course that could be taken to insure the safety ofthe person of the prosecutor. The prisoner was then -called upon to surrender, and on his being asked whether he wished to say anything, - he replied that it was not true that he had any malicious feelng towardsthe prosecutor, or that he ever intended to dohila any inury. TheRicoanxst sid he was very sorry to find that he had allowed -the mufortunate delusion under which he laboured to continue; but he felt it his duty to order him into custody, and Mr. Justicre5rle would be conferred with upon the subjyect of his case. The prisoner was t-hen 3emoved to Newgpte, and direc. tious were ivreu that eve4facility shoulld be afforded him to conunumuate with his friends and any medical gentlemen who might desire to see him. CharIes Alfred Rickaby, 53, described as an accountant but who is well known as the notorious blind swindler-who has carried on a most extensive system of plunder upon the publiec for a great many years, was placed at the bar to take is rialupon several charges of frud and forge. - I I The prisoner, upon being cled on to ple applied for I thepostponementeof his trial-; and when the-Recordei told l him that he saw no ground for granting the application, he aid, insa ioe&timpudenttone, thathe should not plead - I The RIEcoRDEn told him that -if he did noe-xlead he should directajury to be empanelled to try whetherhe was mute of malice or not, and his refusal toplead tould not do him anyood. " GniltyYj The prisoner then said lie would plead"NotGutty. Mr. 7arrt donducted the prosecution. The first case gone into was achargeof having obtained the sum of 68t. 5s. by false preterces. The facts were-of a- very extiAordinary chartcter, and showed the exhtree ingenuity of the prisoner in carying out his frauds. The prosecutor was a-solicitor, tamed Justice, and it aipeared that in-l850 he had a client named Charles Rowe, whom he -knew to be a blind man, but whom he had never seen.- In November of thatyearthe prloner cime in a cab to his officic and introducied himsef as the lr. Rowe foi weotx he had acted, anidhe ave him instractions to proceed-against rseon nuaned Armstrong;to recover 681. for money iehid =vanced.to him, and also an amount which he represented was owing by Armstrong for rent for a house belonging to him, which be occupied. Mr. Justiec, having obtained the address of Armstrong, wrote to him in the usual form, demanding paymnt, and very shortly afterwards Amtronms caiealeuponaiman agreed to paythe 68,.andrso a half quarters 0rent, hut he Mid that before he did so he should require that certain deeds relating to property-which belonged to his wile, and which he said had been handed to the pretended Mr. Rowe, should be given up. The prisoner then camne again to -MnrJustce's office, and, on hs being toldwhat had passed, he said he was ready to deliver up the deeds, but he had placed them in the hands of anotherperson, who had advanced him money upon them, and they could not be obtained unless he paid the amount, which ws 681. ; and he asked Mr. Justice to advatce him the money. It appeared that the arful nature.of the transaction threw the prosecutor completely off his guard, and he gve the prisoner a check for 68?., and he promised to bring the deeds in the afternoon, but neither he nor Armstrong ever again made their appearance at the prosecutor's offlce. Inquries were then made, which resulted in the discovery that the whole proceeding a a freaud from beginning to end con- iocted between Arstrong and the prisoner, and Armstrong was subsequently taied in this court and convicted and sentenced to 18 months' hard labour. Nothing, however, was heard of the prisoner until he was in custody upon some other charges oJf a similar character. The jury, without any hesitation, returned a verdict of Guflty against the prisoner. The was then charged upon another indictment jointly with his son, James lEickaby, aged 21, and William Ca aged 29, with having forged an acceptance to a hill of exchangetfor 50., and ith havingmu tteredthe same withintenct to defraud. M*r. Parryagain appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Sleigh defended the two younger prisoners. The facts of this case were somewhat similar to those dewailed in the last, but the fraud that was attempted as, iff anything, of a still more ingenfiouxs character. The proseceutors were Mesart. Howard and natty, solitors, in tngelc ourt, ThrogmorCon-street; audit appearedthaton September the 12th last year-the prisoner Charles Ricl;aby came to the office, accompanied by Cax, and requested MIr. Howard to give him some professional advice. Or. Howard asked by whose introduction ho had come, and he mentioned the neae of a gentleman named Thompson, with whom he weas acquited. lpon nmquiring the nature of his busine the prisoner saidthat agenteman nanedHoward Clinton,who lived at No. 84, Connaught-terrace, Edgeware-road, owed him dv01., and he wished him to take proceed'1-a to recover the debtd r. H oward accordnigly wrote to the address mentioned, requiring payment of the money, and in due course he receiv led tter aicnowledging the debt and offering to pay 70t. down and the remaider by a proiissory note at a month. The prsecutor upon this commnicated the proposed terms to the prisoner, who at once acceded to them, and eventually Mr. Eowardt received a letter fom the SUp- posed Howar Clinton, containing 701. in bank-notes and aj promissory note for 501. He subsequently saw theprisoner at his own resdence in Trevor-squage, and he there handed to him the notes and the pwrisrsory note for 50h n The prisoner appeared highly pleased with the transaction, and expressed himself desirous to give 31r. Howard two guineas for his trouble, hut that gentleman said that his charge was only one guinea, and he desired no more. The pnssoner theu said he was sorry he had no changce, and be wanted Mlr. Howard to give him his check for 201. and he said hewould give him hiseown for 211. ls.for it. Mr. Howard declined to do this, and the prisoner then asked I him if he would cash the promissory note for him, but this he also declined to do, and the transaction terminated.Is Soon after this the prisoners were taken into custody, and, upon Mr. Howard becoming acquainted with the fact, he instituted inquiries and ascertained that no such HaEw CliCton lived in the Edgeware-road, g Rickaby had paid 6d. at a stationer's shop, for the privilege of having letters addressed to him in that name; and it was also proved that the correspondence with the pretended Howard Clinton and the sinature to the promissory note were in his handwriting. The only evidence against Cox appeared to bethlathe had accompanied the prisoner Charlesltickaby on the first00-: casion of the visit to M1r. Howard's offices, and the Recorder at the close of the case for the prosecution intimated his! opinion that there was not sufficient evidence as regarded him to go to theJury. The tEcoRDxn having summed up the evidence as affecting the other two pnsoners, the jury at once returned I a verdict of Guily against both. Inspector Emmerson, of the P division, who appeared to have taken a great deal of pains in getting up the evidence for the prosecution, stated, in answer to questions put by the RXCOBDXB, that the elder prisoner was convnoted in 1840 of obtaining a number of sums of 501. from different young men,under the pretence that he could obtain for them situations in the Birmingham Railway of 2001. a-year, with lod ,coals, and candles. He had since then been conviced of another offence of a similar character, and his son hadalsobeen convicted of obtaining money by false pretences. The two Rickabys, who had conducted themselves wvith great effrontery and impudence during the proceedings, declared that they were innocent and the younger one said that if he could have called Cox as a witness he would have proved that it was not his handwriting to the note. The old man also declared that if he had had time he should have called Mr. Howard Clinton as a witness to prove tlat he had paid the promissory note, and he was now on his way home from America for that purpose. (This impudent statement was received by a loud lauh from almost every person in court.) TheRBxconnmi, addressing the prisoners, said that no doubt whatever could be entertained of their guilt, and it was quite clear that they were most artful and dangerous persons. HE sentenced them both to four years' penal servitude. When the sentence was pronounced both prisoners became exceedingly violent, and they exclaiiMed that the witnesses who had beenexaminedwereallperjured. Itwaswith some difficulty that they were removed. NEW COURT. (Before MIr. RussxaL GuRNisw, Q.C.) Charles Brown, 21, waiter, and John Williams , 29, labourer, were indicted for a robbery with violence upon the person of William Bartram, and stealing his watch. It appeared that the prosecutor was passmg through teman-street, Whitechapel, at about 12, on Boxing night, when he was set upon by some persons from behind, who seized him by the t at and tried to strangle him. Th then forced him to the ground, and beat and kicked him until he became insensible. A police-constable upon duty near the spot, hearing a noise as of some one being choked, came up. and saw the two prisoners runming away. They were both taken before they had proceeded far, and in the irection they had ru the prosecutor's watch was found lying upon the ground. The pavement near to where the outrage had been committed was covered with blood, and the prosecutor's appearance betokened most severe, illusage. UTpon the prisoner Brown was found the watch of a gentleman who had been robbed and similarly illtreated about balf an hour previously. The Jury found both prisoners Guilty, and they were each sentenced to four years' penal servitude.

These payments, however, were not made, and Mffrs. Hook,with her three children, was compelled to enter the workhouse. It was now stated that if the insolvent would give up possession of the business a Mfr.

The landlord of the house, too, was called, and declined to accept any other person as tenant. There_~ppeared to be no doubt, from enidence given, that Mrs. Hook, aEtr her husband's death, had become addicted to habits of intemperance.

WESTSmesTmL-Mr. .L E Cornish, a medical studeat at St. George's Hospital, whose case was fully detailed in our impression of last Tuesda, appeared to receive the judgment of the Court upon a charge of knocker-stealing It will be remembered that, in consequence of several knockers having been wrenched from doors in Ebury-street, Pimlico, the police were on the alert and apprehended the accused, at 2o clock in the morning, with a knocker anud bel1-pull in his possession. A gentleman, from the firm of Cardale, liffe, and Russell, solicitors, Bedford-row, addressed the presiding magistrate, Mr. PAYTER, onthe prisoners behlf. He saidhewas instructed to admit the accused's unlawful possession of the knocker and bell-pull found upon him, and he hoped that, when the festive season of the year and his client's youth were taken into consideration, they would plead some excuse for the impropriety and indiscretion of wiuch he had been guilty. The accused begged to express his deep regret at what had occurred, and to make a most ample apology to those who had been annoyed by his misconduct, and was anxious to repair any damage, and to place such an amount in the poorbox as the magistrates might direct. 3r. P TE= animadverted in strong terms upon the absurd and snobbish practice of knocker-wrenching, and said that he was strongly inclned, in the first instance, to send the case for trial, because he did not see any vast distinction between the urchin who stole a knocker and sold it for 2d. to purchase a plaything or sweetstuff, and the young gentleman who gratified his love of mischief, or appetite for applause among his senselesss companions, by taking one and carrying it off as a trophyof his skill, for in both cases the owner was put to the same amount of inconvenience and loss, and it was not necessary that the property should be sold to constitute a felony, as a person might steal a thing and purpose to keep it. There were some practical jokes uPOn which the public might look with some degree of indulgence, as .the mischief was seasoned with some amount of humour, but the practice of knockerwrenching was not distinguished by anything of the sort Although he must deprecate this senseless practice in the strongest language, he was not now disposed to subject the accused to reproach for the remainder of his life by commiting him for trial for felony, more especially as the circumstance of the young m3n rushing to adoor anddeclaring he would have a knocker, after he was in the custody of the police, showed that he did not exactly know what he was about. He was glad to find that the case had been met in a very proper manner by an apology and the atonement suggested, and, taking all the circumstances into consideration, he should discharge the accused upon payment of 3!. for the unlawfl possession.

TosTuRE xz IwDiA.-A gross instance of torsure has occurred under the eyes of Calcutta and Mr. Theobald, yet it has received scarcely any atteitionU The punishment was too swift and too severe for a plausible accusation. The case occurred at Kidderpore, within the shadow, as it were, of Government-house. On 'Saturday, the 27th of October, the magistate of the 24-Perguahnns was inforred that a man had been brought into Alipore gaol complaining of the injuries he had received. The man's name was Muntoo. Be had been arrested as he left the Calcutta gaol on a chame of theft, which he denied, but which he subseuently Vwas induced by the torture to confess. It was late in the evening when the report reached the magistrate, and, as the man's life was in no danger, nothing could be done that night. The next day was Sunday, but in such cases promptitude is humanity, and Mr. Fergusson commenced his investigation. The man had been tortured severely. According to his own account, he had been hung to the rafters by the wrists, severely beaten, and squeezed with a bamboo. His shoulders and loins bore maxks of the treatment, and the medical testimony proved that he had sustained severe internal injury. He charged the Thannadar of Xidderpore and his policemen with the crime. It was comnuitted, he said, in the Thannadar's own house, and thither the magistrate proceeded. The bamboo rafter was instantly pointed out, and, on examination, appeared to bear the marks which a heavy rope always leaves on a bamboo. The neighbours testifaed to screams proceeding from the room.* The Jemadar of the Calcutta gaol proved that the vict-had left that establishmentuninjured, andthelocal poiceprovedthattmutooappearedagitatedonhisretumfrom the Mohurrir's house. The fact of torae peareddemonstrated. It remained to ascertain the eri=n Fortunately, directevidencewasnotwanting. Two servantsoftheMoburrir, who had been passive peCtators, testified most unwillingly agamst their master, ome of the burkundazes imlicated confessed, and the case was clear. The Mohu-r had inqtired into the charge of theft. He had directed the accused to be taken to his house. He had there ordered the torture, which was inficted in his presence. The case was fully proved; and on the following morn , not 36 hours after the crime had been co t, the Mohurrir and his accomplices were committed fer triaL Ten days after they were working in chains in -the Alipore gaoL The chief delinquent had been sntenced to hard labour in irons or seven years, and his accomplices to a somewhat shorter period. He could not even mn England have been punished with more swiftness or severity. The Darogal, against whom there was no direct evidence, was recommended for dimisal The case, moreover, is illustrative of another obstacle in the way of Indian reform. In io European country would the magistrate have first heard of this case fromthe gaoler. The indignant neighbourhood would have perfomied his functions. ' The manSs screams were clearly heard, yet no one interfered, or, as far as it appears, eveninquired. There was no horror, no excitement, aid no sympathy. The witnesses gave their evidence reluctantly, and we question whether the Mohuurrir is not stil considered in his own neighbourhood, and among his own class, an inijured man.

2= NIGHTINZGALE FUND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T1IES. Sir,-Although it is probable you will receive from others more conclusive comments upon the letter of "E. M." in 2ne TisTes of this day, there is one passage contained in it upos wehich I presume to of%ier a remuark. It is that passage which refers to "Mr. Skinner of St. Barmabas, and other promoters of the XetimoniaL" Permit me to ay that Mr. Sk-inner, as far as I can learn, is in no degree a "promoter' of the Nightingale Fund-certainly, he as in no way associated or connected with the committee, r.or have his opinions (if they be -what they are assusned to be) found a single upholder or defender there anmou the 12 noblemen and gentlemen who constitute that committee. The apprehens:ons of "E - M." that the fund will be '"applied to tbe establishment of a corps of Sisters of Charity or anything else which. may be used for the purpose of proselytism," I believe to be as groundless and idle as they would be if they concerned the danger of hiss Nightingale DrOpgat in England the religion of Mahonmet. IIt -E.]L had emauined the list of the committee, he might have perceived a sufficient guarantee against a disaster which he dreads apparently upon no other ground than a surmise that " Mr. kiinner of St. Barnabas" desires it. It is not too much to say that four-fifths of the comnittee of the Nightingale Fund would not have been of its members if thev had not been well assured on this important point; and I an not, I think, going too far if I assert my belief that they would cease to be of that body, to-morrow if they saw cause for dread that the fund wodld be " applied to the establishment of a corps of Sisters of Charity or anything else which may be used for the purpose of proselytism." At least, I may speak for myself, and say my services limble as they are, would be withdrawn if I had the remotest reason for alarm such as that which has hitherto kept from tho fund the contribution of " E. X." butwhich I rpcp_ot£fuByhope will bewvithheld no longer. Your faithful scrvant. S. C. HALL, Hon. Sec. a an. D.

Wetherall, Sceots Fusileer Gucrds, to be Aides-deCamp to the Queen, with the rank of colonel in the army. Lieutenant-Colonel x. P. Campbell, 90th Regiment, to be colonel in the army, for distinguished conduct in the field." No. 2. Witblreference to ihe circular memorandum from the Horse Guards, dated Sept. 19, 1855, onthe subject of services of officers, the returns required must be sent as goon as possible after the 1st of January next, instead of the 1st of April. In the column for leave of absence, it should be stated whether it was by wounds or illness, certified by Medical Board, or on private affairs, and whether to England or any other place. Short periods under one month not to be inserted, unless an officer was thereby prevented from being present at some action where his regiment was engaged. It is of great consequence that the infoxmation contained in these retumns should be perfectly accurate; therefore every officer can see the return of his own services. The best attention of general and commanding officers must be given to these returns; and Field-Marshal Viscount Hardinge desires that the statement of each officer's service may be signed by the officers commanding regiments, brigades, and divisions.

A RUSSIAN VIRW OF A BALTIC CAMPAIGN. I Lc NoYd, of Brussels, discusses as follows the chances of the expected Baltic campaign:- - 1lthe plans Eketched by the English press, and said to be those which the allies have formed for the ensuing year,I the project of a landing in Finland occupies the foreground. To attack Russia simultaneously in the north and the south, by land and sea, to place her between two firesthis is, indeed, a gigantic plan, but it appears to us, for that very reason, to be impracticable. Admitting that the allies may be disposed to renew by a war in the Baltic the enormous outlay and the sacrifices entailed on them by their expedition to the Black Sea, we may ask ourselves whether, after they have uselessly been scratching Russia's feet, they will succeed in overthrowing her by seizing her by the hair or by pinching her ear? For it is to bo observed that upon landingan army in Finland, or on any other point of the Baltic coast, the allies would find themselves confronted by obstacles far greater than those of the Crinmea In that peninsula the campaign, interrupted by the vinter, could be resumed in the spring. In the Baltic, wlhere the navigation is only open for jfour or five months of the year, it must be otherwise. The alies must obtain a complete and decisive victory in a single summer; they mrust smite Russia so terrible a blow as to prevent her recovering herself during the winter. Now, if the alliesif England especially-have been able to make preparations for so great an enterprise, we must suppose. that the Russian Government has not remained a passive spectatoron her part. Ve confess we do not believe in the destruction of Cronstiadt, and the English believe in it just as little as ourselves; but, conceding, for the sake of our argument, of course, that this eventuality is probable or possible-admitting even that the allies may be able to mal-ke a demonstration against St. Petersburg-it will be seen that we are making very large concessions-do they imagine that Russia would thereupon consider herself vanquished ? She would be stunned, we grant, but not overthrown, and one winter would serve to put her on her legs again. And, even in this case, can it3 be reasonably admitted that this blow can be dealt her in asingle,campaign? fly, the allied army would be obliged to re-embark in tht autumn, or else on the approach of vinter it would resign itself ntlens voltens to the disagreeable7alternative of seeing its retreat utterly cut off, comnunication with the fleet, driven away by the ice, destroyed-this, too, in a country wbere it would not have a roof,ov&i-rits head, or a sack of ilour for its sustenance; where the cold, far different from that of the Crimea, sinks to 30 and 40 degrees of Reaummur; where, lastly, thc Russian army, which would then be in its olwn eleinent, might choose its own time to swvoop upon it when exhausted by cold and hunger, compelling it to yield or accept battle,tthe result of which could not be doubtful. " Let this expedition be made to!Finland or to the Baltic provinces,' of even7ttolboth points at ¶once-a thing less practicable than ever-stil the conditions under wvhichl it could be carried out would be the same. It is not upon hypotlhesis we7 ground our reasoning, but on the nature of these countries themseves-that is to say, on the winter, Russia's !potent auxiliary. Aks we see,'the frosts of the north have their own little special advantages. Then, again, Russia possesses at this moment one army in Finland, another in the Baltic provinces, a third in Poland, and yet a fourth in St. Petersburg and its neighbourhood. Surely these are obstacles not to be surnounted in a hm-ry, nor can any one dream of doing so. In every case, it will not be English troops that can do it. It will hence be on the shoulders of the French army that Great Britain would once again lay aUl the burden of this fresh expedition. Now, we are of opinion that the French Govermnent-a better judge than England of everything connected with military operations-would look twice before it ventured on so difficult and formidable an enterprise. It seems to us, besides, that the French have been for two years doing England's work- for her, and paying dear enough for her alliance, notto consider themselves now completely out of her debt. If it is the task of these English to destroy Cronstadt-if that is all they have to do-wly have they not done it this year, when they have been showing off before its forts all the summer ? And if it is by the help of their new gunboats and floating-batteries which they talk so much about, tlat they count on effecting their object ne.-t year, we are afraid they will once more have to be satisfied with teeding their imagination and shooting away their powder. " In the first place, Cronstadt is not Kinburn ; again, the success attained by these floating-batteries at the bombardmenit of that pretty fortress, where they were employed for the first time, is not yet proved, for the simple reason that Kinburn, the construction and armament of which had undergone no change since the last century, possessed none of those engines that may be happily employed against these said batteries. There was not even a single Paixhan gun in that fort. It s different with Cronstadt; and, formidable as this fortress has alwaays been, consistin- notoriously of several forts, it is more than probable that, since those floating-batteries have been known at St. Petersburg, they have discovered the means of counter-arming themselvesthere. "The present war has provedithat the arms_of the engi. neers and artillery are not so badly wielded in Russia, and that under this head their inventive powers are not so poverty-stricken as previously supposed. The Russians, it is true, are not in the habit of trumpeting their progress anid discoveries. If others feel inclined to consider this reserve of theirs as a proofof. weakness, we, for our parts, see in it a pledge of success, for which both tact and prudence are the first conditions. " Thus, even when reasoning on the hypotheses most favourable to the allies, tbe possible chances of a favourable issue to an approaching campaign in the Baltic-whether we consider it to be a gigantic enterprise comprehending the invasions of Einland and the Baltic provinces, or whether we reduce it to its simplest expression-that is to say, to the mere bombardment of Cronstadt, it cannot by any possibility have for Russia those consequences to which the English journals are pleased to see her already reduced. "We have not yet'spoken, our readers perceive, of an active co-operation on the part of Austria, for we do not suppose they;can seriously depend on such a thing either at Paris or losidon. Besides, if Austria were really to take the field against Russia, we are justified in believing, from the private infornation we possess, that she would eneounter a more violent resistance than she expects-a resistance which on some future day might recoil on Austria, and work more mischief than they seem to calculate upon at Vienna. " The reflectons just submitted to the reader are not intended to prove that Russia ought not to make peace. Quite the contrary. They are given merely by way of answer to those threatenig, and, as we think, unseasonable clannoursraised withi the last few days by the semi-official organs of the Vienna and London press. The object is so transparent, under existing circumstances, that of creating a sort of moral pressure, that no one will allow himself to be taken in by it. "If it is passing strange to see the journals of England, who im this war has only played a secondary part, holding forth every day to Russia, in a threatening tone, the conditions of peace which they condescend to consider accept able, the Austrian journals, one would think, assigl with far less grace the same motives to their Government, which has much less right than England has to hide its own ambitious and selfish views under unjustifiable and selfish pretensions. The guestion whether Russia is or is not interested in concluding peace at this present time is very debateable, and very differently judged. We ought, then, to beware how we render the solution of that question too difficult." _

THE ICOOME-TUX. TO THE EDITO61 OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I perceive in Vic Timics of Friday a letter from a Manchester correspondent, complaining of the unequal operation of the present mode of levying the income-tax-parties with limitedincomes having to bear the burden of this tax, while others, with more ample means, escape scot free. Is it possible that this unequal pressure and the present heavy percentage are the result of an estimate formed on incorrect data, and, consequently, that the payers of income-tax are suffering under a heavier impost than would have been the case had the estimate been more correct ? I agree with "Fair Play" that, "Now that this tax is so heavy, and likelv enough to be increased, it is only fair that every person HAle oi'ht to be comnefled to pay , and I hope that if you, Sir, wiMl allow asmall portion of your space, or, what would be more effectual than anything, use your powerful influence, to expose wlat is a clear injustice, a remedy in some measure would be found for it The evasion of income-tax is not a tldn" confined to "bachelors livin- in lodgings, and making their 2001. or 3001. a-year as safesmen and clerks," and "who have never been applied to.'" It is in the matter of house property that this is perhaps most glaringly the case. The inhabited house duty affecting only houses worth the annual rent of 20?. or upwvards, the consequence is 'hat numbers of persons having incomes, many of them liable to a large amount of tax, are investing all that they can spare in the erection of small dwelling-houses, which, in realty, often pay an enornious percentage on the outlay; and, by ostensibly apportioning these among different members of the family (so as yet to keep the share of each below the amount chargeable with the tax), they thus evade both the income-taxand the inhabited house duty; and the result is that in the manufacturing end mining districts, such as the one from wvhich I write, there is springing up a description of dwelling-houses of a most mserable description, w hich will have their invariably demoralizing effect upon all families that inhabit Whly should not every house be taxed in a ratio corresponding with its rentable value? WVe should then have fewersuchdensasnowv we see humanbeingsbecomingbratalized in; we should have less evasion of the income-tax, at least, in this very objectionable way; and we should have moreof thatveryexcellentprincipleof "FairPlay'"infused into the operation of our taLxes, and your correspondent less reason to complain of their Dresent uneonal uressLur_ .1 am, Sir, your obedient senant, w. C. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your paper of the 4th inst. you inserted a communication from Manchester signed " Fair Play," sugesting "that before laying on anv new taxes some steps should be taken to endeavour to collect the full amount of the income-tax." I fully agree with your correspondent as to the number ofpersons who have been allowed to escape the payment of thns tax: and am well assured that his remarks apply to the metropolis quite as much, if not more than tney may to Manchester. There is one other-subject against which you vill, I trust, direct your powerful influence, and that is the large amounts which are now paid for the levying and collecting of this tax. It must be admitted by every one that in all the large towns the collectors are unnecessarily overpaid, and that the clerks to the commissioners receive enormous amounts in the shape of poundage. As to the duties of the latter (if nocessary at all), the Government could without doubt find hundreds of highilyhonourable, as well as responsible, gentlemen who would gladly undertake the duties of the most important division in the kingdom for the sum of 50. per annum. As this tax has now become a very serious consideration to the community at large, I trust you will kindly give insertion to these observations and oblige your obedient .crv5tI AN INCOME-TAX PAYER.

THE CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION ' 1- QUESTION. TO THE EDlTOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Ibr. Bromley Surely sin-rnders t-he -whole case in supprt ofa proposal for an insurance, or a -widowe', and cIndrenx's pension scheme,'when he admits, as he does in his letter published in 27te Tibne of this d,at aplication for signatures to the memorial presente to the 'ncellor of the Exchequer in 1853 was not miade to the numerous detached officers of Customs and Excise throughout the country-a body forming, as he must be'awar, the large majority of "1thos poorer brethren the amelioration of whose 6ndition he has had so much at heart." 'Their opinion, however, has now been given, after a clear explanation, in numerous -instances 'within the rzitrs nowledge, r fithe differeiaoe in herayer of the two memorials; and the result is an application from 9,000 out of l1,000KciVi1ans.no.wsubjected to the tax-, requesting relief from future deductions. They do not ask for a return of. the suzplus of 750,0001., and I do not anticipate, under present circumsteanceg, that the rmost sanguine can expect they would be listened to if they did. Afterwhat-has occurred I cannot agree wvith Mr. Brom- ley, " that the s~ignatures obtained to a second dlocument ton be submitted to Farlianent only evince the desire of the service at large to have the grievance they complain of s'peedil redressed." Specific relief is prayed for, hut not the insurance scheme; and, although I am well aware that. it is entirely for the vwisdom of Parliament to deeide as to theprecise mode inwhichthis relief is to be granted, I have yet to learn that a respectful expression of our feelings on the sulbjoctcan dohalmto the canse, more espeially -when the only real point of difference is to be foundnN the efforts and persistence of a smnall minority to force a very qouestionale boonton the large majority, who are disinclined Let .5Er.

-PHOTOGPAPHIC PAC-ZJILES OPF OLD DctL A:rEN2' 1To THEEDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -In your journal of the 6th ult. there appeared a letter from Mr. Maxwell Lyte on photographic fau-similes of old aocuments, which is calculated to discourage attempts in one of the most Valuable applications of the photographic art; but, as the statements contained in this letter are at valiance with the experience of most photographers, I think, for tho credit' of the art they ought not to pass oncontradicted. First, Mr. Lyte finds the grand obstacle to obtaining these fac-suniles to be, " that the size of old paper becomes yellowed by age, vwhereas the ink becomes lighter." Now, in photography it is necessary to be iery precise when speaking of coloors; thus, by yellow is understood the yellow of the .spectrun, of wldch gamboge may be taken as therepresentative. Surely, Mr. Lyte will hardly venture to assertthat old documents ever assume that colour, or even any tone of it. By the agencies of smoke and damp old documents frequently become brown, acquiring various tones of umber or sepia, from which the ink differs but very little in colour or tone, but yet this difference, slight as it is, is generally sufficient to insure a good photographie copy. Experience and tact are, it is true, important elements in success, and probably all first atteempts will be failures. Yet, as is well known to most practitioners of the art, wherever any difference exists between the eolour of the paper and the ink that difference will be repeated in the photographic copy. Mr. Lyte considers these browns of old documents, theoretically, as if they were yellow and black, and hastily concludes that, as these latter have the same actinie action, erspo the browns, which he regards as yellows, mtust produce the same photographic reslt;, which, as is -well known, is not the case. Mr. Lyte's want of success must, I fear, be ascribed to this perverse theory; if not, to his want of perseverance in mastering the diffieculties that attend the practice of this branch of photographic art. The portfolios of most amateurs generally contain specdmens of fac-similes of old documents, proving that the difficulty of obtaining thema is not so great as Mr. Lyte's letter wvould lead us to suppose. I enclose one copied from a LS. in the Royal Irish Academy, taken in the summer of 1852, durmig the Dublin Exhibition, which probably presented as many difficulties as are usually met with in documents of this kind; and, yet no great effort is required to make out every letter remaining in the manLscript. Photography does not pretend to restore wlhat is effaced or illegible in the original, but there are few things it cannot furnish a faithful copy of I have learnt recently that it is contemplated tomakc a catalogue of the MS. inthe Bibliotheque Imperiale at Paris, by taking photographic copies of the title-pages, &c.; if the obstacles to taling photographic fac-similes were as great as 3Ir. Lyte represents, such a task would scarcely be iudertaken. It is too much the practice of photographers to p?roclaim the abortive results of their individual attempts as unpossibilities of the art they cultivate ; whereas they ought to consider that thesame experiment which in the hands of one person is a failure is often a brilliant success in those of another. As no one among your numerous readers has thought it worth while to rply to 3;r. LW's letter, I hare taken upon myself to do so, or, as an old practitioner in the art, I feel its character of universality in application shlould not be inconsiderately inpugned. Photographic fac-similes of old documents are, I feel assured, not easily over-valued. Let no photographer be discouraged from attempting to produce them. I remain yours faithfullv BnnrP IL DEIAXOTTE. King's College, Jan. 4.
ThE LATE SIB W mmx MoLrswonTir.-At the court for the receipt of rents due to the estate of the late Sir WVilliam Molesw*rth, which was heid a few days ago at Washaway, Mfr. W. Tomn, the oldest tenant, proposed that the company should drink in silence to the memnory of their late lamnented landlord. Mr. Tom prefaced the proposal by giving an outline of the political career of Sir Williamn Molesworth; and his proposition was duly honoured. The health of. Lady Molesworth was also proose, ad te tastwasver codialyreceived. Mr. Olver, who responded to theo toiast of the tOenaotiy, paida mentioned severaal instances °of is ttlibeZralitye land kindnes, mu to his honour,hadnever attempted to infuence the pltclvews of his tenants, but always allowedl them to otin6 anvay they pleased. THE ONNIBUS EXN-r-TE CoPRDAL.-Yesterday morning the first instalment of the London omnibus connexion was passed over to the French Compaigue G&nErale, anlw duly worked hy them through the day. This was thie Holloway line, belonging 4to M1r. Wilson. It consisted of 50 ominibuses with 500 4orses, employing about lSO mien, all of whom aro now in the sersice of the Anglo-French General Omnibuas Company of London. The " times," which are a special privilege, reigionsly guarded byp the omnibus fraternity, and considered to be of equsil value with the vehicles, &c., were also mrade over as part of the bargain. A similar transfer w-as executed yest-erday by Mr. Leonard Willing, the oldest omnibus proprietor in London, who, 'with others, conveyed to the sm-e parties the Stoke Newington and Kingaland and Daiston line, comprising 2 omnibuses, 200 horses, and 70 menploy&. The French company's intended system of "°P correspondence" (by which a person getting into an omnibus iii any part of nonlon miay be conveyedl at one charge lo any point of destination ,by the miutual exchange of passengers) dioes not come into action until their new carriages are built, and theirpurslacesof the other London timnes are completed. How far these have advanced can be judged, since a valuation is actualy in progress of the folowing (for which the bargain has aroeady been strck), viz. :-Oewington andC Hfackney (the Wellmngtons), 20 omnibuses, 150 homses, with en ; Brompton and Fulham, 40 omnibuses, 400 lorses, with 140 men; Chelsea and Hoe on, and Chelsea and etwhnal-green, 37 omnibuses, 370 hormes, and 120 mien; Kentroad and HEoton, 12 omnibuses, 10 horms, -with 40 men; Hackney and Clapton, 10 omnibuses, 100 horses, with 35 men; Woodford, 5 four-homse naails; Barnet, 2 four-homse nails, with an establishment of 100 horses and 30 xen; maling a total-now actually the paroperty of the French C3ompagnie Gonrtale-of 198 vehices, work-e by 1,940 horses, and giving occLpation to 70 mien. As might be supposed, the appearance of so wholesae a pthrchaser has somewhat enhanced the omnibus market, and it is probable that theCompagnie Gn6rale may have todefer their further arrangements until the excitement has partalUy subsided. The following well-known namnes have alreadly retiredl from omnibus proprietorship in favour of the French allince Haitley, Chancellor, Wilng, acnamiara, Wil1son, Rennet5 Woodfiord, Hlunt, Folrge, Prome, Martin, Home, Seale, illiaettmeis, cle, froemC rpson, daned chTtohe d9 ioiCult Town has been in a great state of excitement for the last month. It was announced that a very rich gentleman hadl arrivedintheLightaing steamer, rejoicing in the well-known name of Mouteliore, as agent for the great Rothschild, -with power to invest capital at the Cape in whatever hie might considler most advantageous. The mining and tramway shares -rose immediately, and everybody thought there was a good timnecomirngfor the Cape at last. The bank and two or three of the largest houses were advised by the Rothschilds to give their nephew, Montefiore, unlimited credit. Althoughea Jew, he gave 15?. to the Cathedral, 10?. to the Synagogue, 51. to the Waesyans~, 101. to the pulic library, and 10?. to the Museum-iii fact, scattered his oney in all directions.
