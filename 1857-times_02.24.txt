The LONDON REFORMIATORY, 9, Great Smithstreet, Wesbtminster, w*as the first Institution of this Clam. Since it was re-built and re-opened, a twelvemouth has nearly elapsed and the emigration of its SO inmates commences as they severally comp~lete their twelvemontib's preparationi for it. The Society is without fund for this puciese, and Indeed for the ordinary expenses of the Institution; andl, it neither the Government or the public will hencefor-ward suvpply them, it must shortly be closed, and all its valuable influaence and expetencoe lost The Commnittee affim with confidence that the multipliction of instItutions like this Isathe only remeodyfor the ex. iteing eviLl,Lt not these unhappy men, munsnraking an effort to esape from their course of life, be ceetbhaokagain upon the streetsafor want of timelysaid, Subeesiptions received at theInstitution,whereColeI Henry Since, late H.

itHave always considered it a privilege ~to have ~been JLable, in any degre, to aselstl in a work so eminently calculated to promaote thte well-being; of the poorer classes In our overgrown metropolls, and to improve their conditon, material, moral, and socal, onlieving extreme destitution, affording aid and comfort ini the season of siokaess, and taking away the excuse for mendicancy. One especial feature of the Society's work is the great assistance whIch It has rendered to th arochial clergy In the Imoportant duty of viitn their V,orerParihinrs from house to house, and by the formation ofoca
islling Committees to draw closer the hands of Christian sympathy and love. Another strikingly beneficial result of the systemn carried Into effect box the Association Is the increased numaber of Provident
SWatee i Peny Savings-banks, and the extraordinary amount of money deposite by the working classe of the mietropolis, I must ever feet a deep interest in the suecesg and progessof the Association.
-Prom a letter ot Bishop Blomnfeld, dated P ihm Palace, 13th of December, 112.
The separation of tioe rich and the poor by theirseparate residenoess
in the east and west of London Io not to be dlenied. Wen we wander through the splendid streets and spacious squares of the western districts we are inclined to exclaim, " VWher are the Moor? We see on every side the mansiona of the weathy ;we see the highly embellished and decorated shops which minister to their luxury ; but we scarcly see any representatives of the labourinI etrses of the metropolis ; and yet X apprelheno, ittis an unquestionable truth, and %he useoessa resul6 of the law by which socijety is constructed, that ever hIouse which is built by a nobleman, a banker, or a merchant in Relgrave or Eaton square, or the adjacent stretet, gnenertes a certain amount of pOV"ioaln, which is cast upon the eastern distrcts remaoyed out of mort anlsouls,t mind, but continuaily gowing and multiplying im.- mraDob.living, dyinig, and passing Into the grave-bundredls and thousands of whom we know nothing, hear notbing, whom we never see and for whora we generasly do nothing. Thin Is undoubtedly a ierious sand appalling state of things. Iti hardly poesible to hiope tht it will receive more tha n itigaton ; but at the same time great mittigatiouIt ma7 recive. As the honoured name ofBisopBlomafieid has been mnentioned. I may perhaps, be permitted to remind the meeting that to him we owe the Metropolitan Visting and Relief As-. sociation which was the first recognition, in a 1ermanent form, of the duty of ilbs west towards the evas of London, or it was founded on the express anticipation that through its mnedium a prino h

u consequence of the change in the rate of dividend by the vote of the proprietors, at the genieral meeting, from
a1 to 6 per cent. per annum for tho past half-year, the issue of the dividend warrarts is deferred until the 5th of Mirch.
NORTH LONDON.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yes6 terday at the Euston station; Mr. J. Scott in the chair.
ir. EL CHUBn read the report, an abstract of which appeared in Vie 2imes of yesterday.
The C ntM, in moving the adoption of the report, said it was so full and explicit that it did not require any observations from him; ho would, however, answer any 9uestions that might be deemed necessary, and give any in. rormation in his power.
Mr. R. D. MAicGLES, M.P., seconded the motion.
Mr. CRUBB at the request of Mr. Onyon stated that 153,000 tons of goods had been couveyed over the line during the past half-year, and 166,000 tons at the correspondins period. On an analysis of the trafflic they found that of the 13,000 tons difference 10,000 tons consisted of war stores and heavy machinery, and the remaining 3,000 tons showed the fallng off in the gener&l traffic, as compared with the corresponding period o 1855.
Mr. ONYox said he found, on inquiry amuong his neighburs in the city, that, instead of receiving Manchester goods from the Ha- don-square station as formerly, they were sent from Camden-town by one of the great carrers to their destination in the city. He knew that the influenoe of Messrs. Pickford and Messrs. Chaplin and Horne was limmense, and ho did now blame them for exercismn it to get traffic, but he complained of the railway officials for letting them have it instead of the railway.
Mr. MANGLES said the directors had represented the tter to the.North-Wegtern Company, and it was being attended to. They would perceive that the traffic had since increased over their line.
In reply to Mr. PARsoNs it was stated that every 6d. of interest and every hability of that kind was charged to the debit of revenue.
Mr. ATsHPAr said the accounts were clearly stated, and from tb'shortness of the report ke presumed things were Roing on very well. He hoped they had no intention of leasing the line to the London and North-Western Company, because the traffic was progressive, and he had no dout, in the course of some time, would yield them 6 or 7 per cent. (Hear, hear.)

WEST END OF LONDON AND CRYSTAL PALACE.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the office, Gresham-house, Mr. S. Beale in the chair.
The report stated that the portion of the line between Wandsworth-common and the Crystal Palace was opened for traffic on the 1st December last, and the results have exceeded the expectations of the directors. The line was efficiently worked by the Brighton Company, and there was no doubt that the traffic from the several stations would prove an important source of revenue to the company. The Norwood branch would be opened in time for the spring excursion traffic to the Crystal Palace. The construction of the remainder of the line was proceeding with vigour, and 22 acres of land at the foot of the new Pimlico-bridge had been obtained from the Crown for the West-end terminus, which would thus possess an area and approaches second to none of the metropolitan railways. To meet the wishes of many of the proprietors arrangements had been made with the contractors under which the 7 per cent. on the B shares would commence from July next. The sanction of the proprietors would be requested to the creation of new shares, bearing a 6 per cent. preference, to an amount not exceeding 112 ,5v0L; and to the further exercise of the company's borrowing powvers to the extent of 37,5001. This stock it had been arranged that Messs. Peto and Co. would take in payment for the works, subject to giving the proprietors and the public the option of taking it, or any portion of it, within three years. The opening of the Mid-Kent ailway to the junction with this company's extension at Beckenham had rendered it of the utmost importance that the construction of the line between Norwood and Bromley should be immediately proceeded with. An adyantageous arrangement had been entered into with the contractors for land, works, &c., for a fixed sum to be paid entirely in shares and debentares of the company. The capital account showed that 384,7381. had been received, and 377,0661. expended, leaving a balance of 7,6721.
The CHAMmAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said that, notwithstanding the line was only opened to the middle of Wandsworth-common, the traffic was very satisfactory, as it yielded 11. a-mile a-week. The Norwood branch was ready for ballasting, and would be re.zdy for traffic in two months. The price demanded by the Government for the 22 acres of land was 85,0001., but the sum fixed by arbitration was 60, 0001 , and this included the right to the pier, for which 25,0001. was demanded. The company had power to commute the purchase into a 4 er cent, perpetual rent, It would be the west end station or the whole of the south of England.
Sir S. M. PLTo remarked they had been very fairly dealt with by the chief commissioner. A very large plot of land near their intended station had since bcen purchased at more than double the price the company had paid for their land.
Sir J. PAXTOi, MLP., seconded the motion. He believed it would be one of the best paying railways nesr London. The whole cost would not be so much as that of the land for the North London Railway.
Sir M. PETo said the contractors for the line from Bromley to St. Mary Cray were energetic men, and he believed that line would be opened about the end of the year. Their line would also be opened to the west-end terminus, and it was intended to open the two lines on the same day, making an aggregate length of about 18 miles. (Hear, hear.) The new ridge at CheLsea would be opened by Midsummer.
Resolutions were passed adopting the report, re-electing the retiring directors and auditors; authorizing 80,0001. to be raised for the Bromley line, 112,501I. for the main line and the borrowing powers, and adoptingthe agreement with the Brighton Company. A vote of thanks concluded the proceedings.
SOUTH DEVON.
The report of the directors states that the disposable balance for the half-year ending the 31st of December last amounts to 24,4041., out of which the directors recommend a dividend of 12s. 6d. per share on the whole shares, abzorbing 12.4711., the half-year's dividend, 5s. 4d. per share on the half-shares, would require 6,0701., and on the new shares 2,2501., leaving a balance of 4,G121. The trafric receipts for the half-year amounted to 71,9141., against 66,11. a. he corresconding period of 1855. The holders of the half-shares will' be entitled, after the 15th of March next, in addition to the receipt of 10s. 9d. per annum, to share rateably in the whole earrings of the company, after payment of preferential charges. It will therefore be necessary to close the revenue account on the 15th of March, and the large balance now proposed to be carried forward, being then credited to the holders of the whole shares exclusively, a great diminution of their dividend in Augutst nest will be prevented.
BOSTON, SLEAFORD, AND MIDLAND COUNTIES,
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at the Euston Hotel yesterday, Mr. Ingram, M.P., in the chair.
The report stated that since the last half-yearly meeting, the works between Granthan, and Sleaford had progressed most satisfactorily, and there was no doubt that this section vould be ready for traffic in May next. An agreement has been made with the Great Northern Railway Company for working the line when completed to Sleaford, and afterwards to Boston, for a period of 10 years, for 50 per cent, of the gross earnings, keeping in good repair the entire property; so that one-half the earnings from the opening of the e would be available for dividend. The Great North. ern and the Ambergate Railway Companies have agreed to carry over their respective lines aU coal sent from the midland distaict for shipment at Boston at the rates proposed by the coal owners of snch district, thereby enabling te directors to comply with the conditions on which these gentlemen have promised their pecuniary assistance in extending the line to Boston. The directors have entered into a provisional contract with Messrs. Smith and Knight for completing theline to Boston, and are also proceeding with tho purchase of the lands over which the proposed line will pass. lmmediately on the agreement with the coalowners being perfected the works between Sleaford and Boston will be commenccd, and, as they are of an unusually light description, the contractors wi be enabled to have this part of the line opened for traffic early in the spring of next year. The report, after stating that the trade of Boston has considerably increased, and on completion of the railway the probability that 500,000 tons of coals will pass over it to Boston for shiipment for continental ports, expresses the unabated confidence of the directors in the success of the undertaking.
On the imotion of the CHAsRstMA~N the report was adopted. The directors and auditors were elected, The mneeting was then made special, and the directors were authorized to exercise the borrowing powers of tae company.
Avote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings
WHITEHAVEN AND FUS NESS,
The report of the directors of thin corapany states that the gross receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of Deeomber amounted to 9,9761., as against 7,5181. ino the corresponding period of 1855, and 7,2061. in 1854, The expenses amounted too 4,4701., 4,9711., and 4,3921. respectively, While the traffic receipts exceed those of the corresponding half of 1855 by 2,4:571., there was a decrease in the expenses for the same period of 51O. The maintenance of permanent way has been placed in the hands of the cormpany's own officers. The agreement with the Cleator Company for mutual working and the construction of sidings at Corkickle for the iron ore traffic has received the anpent of the Board of Trade, The preofit and loss
aonnt is charged with 6 501., the first instalment 9 Xn he price of a new locomotive,' and with the total amount of the interest onx bonds and loans. The balance, 7801., will allow of a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum on the preference shares, leaving 356 The directors state that the changes made in the staff of the company are workigg satisfactorily, and the reseipts show a steady and continuing increase, The capital account showed that 411,52,1. had been received, and 458,9548 expended, leaving a bbaance against the company of 47,42X8
WHlTEHAVEN JUNCTION.
The report of the directors of this company states that tbs gross traffic for the half-year ending the 31st e f Decemberomountpd. to 11,2251., being an increase of Z,. over taS, of the coxnespopiding polenof 1g55 p iod to jieases
to 5,3801., being an increase of only 1851. The direch r; have terminated tho contract for tho maintenance of the permanent way, and have plaeed the charge of it in the nands of ihfuir own inspector, with a view to insure ultimate ecenomy and efficient repairs. The net revenue for the balf.year amounts to 5,8441. Daring the half-year 1,012h has been paid for new constructions, including the extension of the sea wall near Harrington, and, the capital account being closed on the appropriation of 1321. in part payment of these works, the directors have had to charge the difference between the two sums-namely, 8801., to net revenue. There is also carried to debit of this aecount 7231., which includes half the cost of new tools and machinery, the other half being paid bytheWhitehaven and Fnrness Corn p any. The charges thus made to net revenue amount to l,6(5l., and reduce the balance available for dividend to 1,9871. The directors suggest that a dividend of 7s. per share, or 3.~ ner cent, per annum, be declared for the a aving 237h The capital account shows that 193,0001. had been received and expended.
SOUTH WALES.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Friday, At the Royal Hotel, Paddington; Mr. C. B. M. Talbot, h.P., in the chair.
The report stated that the traffic receipts showed an increase of 17,0211., and the working eXDenses an increase of 12,1591. during the half-year. as compared with the corresponding period of 1855. The available balance of 66,878L would admit of the payment of a dividend for the halfyear (after providing for the dividends on the preference stock and shares) at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 4,0161. to be carried forward to the nex;t half-year. The expenditure of capital during the half-year had been incurred principally in the construction of the pier and other works at Milford Haven, in the extension of sidings, and in the laying of the second line of rails between Carnnarthen and Mfilford Haven. The portion of the second line between Carmarthen and St. Clears, adistance of abour eight miles had been recently opened for traffic. The directors had given notice to the Great Western Railway Compay of their intention to terminate the award of Sir William Cubitt on the 30th June next, and the terms fxed by his award to be paid tothe Great Western Railway Company for the supply of rollingstock would cease to be payable from that.day. A negotiation would at once he opened with the directors ofthe- Great -Western Rmilway Company, with the view of fixing the terms upon which rolling stock should for the future be supplied. A negotiation was in progrescs with the view to the establishmnent of the traffic, by means of fast and powerful steam beats, between Milford Haven and Cork, upon a more permanent and satisfactory basis than that on which it had hitherto been conducted,
An abstract of the accounts has appeared In The Times.
The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said he had found upon his arrival in town the night before that Mr. ILI Roche had applied to the Vice-Chancellor for an injunction to restain the company from paying any dividend until they had completed the Pembroke branch of their line. He had been aware that sooner or later they vould have to make that branch, and whatever the cost might be he had recommended them to construct it. An agreement had been drawn up by their soliCtor which would enable them to pay the proposed dividendl upon certain conditions involving the construction of the branch line. The cost of the line would be 300,0001., or about 15,000O. per mile, the length being 20 miles, and a contractor was willing to take it for that sum. After adverting to the award of Sir W. Cubitt, which would terminate in June next, and its injurious effects upon their coal traffic, he stated that the board intended to set apart a sum every half-year towards providing an accident fund of 10,0001. He hoped that in the course of a very short time they would be able to establish a regular communication between Milford and Cork.
A discuumion ensued, in the conrse of which the report was adopted, and the dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock was declared payable on the 9th of March.
A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings.

Maynooth v. St. Omer.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Your temperate article upon Mr. Spooner's motion and its consequences commands respect, and would carry conviction, if one of the principal argumxents was not founded on a misconception, which none but a native could clear up. You assume that the home education of priests for the Irish Roman Catholic Church must be preferable to one obtained on the continent. Here is the unfortunate fallacy.
Abstract acquirements, such as their Church demands, can of oourse be obtained at Maynooth; but the priests who were formerly intended for that ministry, and were trained at the various colleges on the continent, were quite different in demeanour and conduct from the produce of Maynooth. I remember many of them. They had been civilized in manners, and, apart from the duties of the calling, were not the same in their ways of thinking as the priesthood of the present day. They were willing to, and did, associate with the Protestant gentry-in short, ware civilized members of society, and were respected as such by those of the opposite faith. What are the characteristics of the priests educated by the public money at Maynooth wlhen they go forth? The public experience will answer this question. What
ivilization can they impart afterwards or receivo among the population they are set over? I wish it were otherwise, but this appalling disadvantage peculiar to Maynooth cannot be got over.
As saving is not the object with the Protestants, better a thousand times give the money in a different channel to effect the same purpose.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Sir,-May I relate what occurred to me on Bllackheath last night ?-a contrast to what happened to Mr. Lea on Ham pstead-heath. (See Thie Times of to-day.) I was crossing the heath about 11.20 p.m., going south. It was very dark, though the stars were shining. Suddenly I was astonished at perceovin the grud -oany yards before me illuminated by a deleate blue light. It reminded me of the" goodpeople" of other days, now replaced by garotters. I looked up, and above head, at a considerable height, was a pale blue luninous orb, so like a Roman candle in shae and appearance that, had it not been Sunday night, an so late, I should have concluded it was a gf$ d'artif Ie. Th~e meto(frscitwsdeendobqul but rapidly towards the west, gradually diminishing in size but deepening in (blue) colour. When it bad traveled
far (apparently, from my point of view) as the belt of Orion it collapsed, and vanished, accuning to eject, at 'th moment of eollapse, a small yellow star, which, aftergon
westward about an (apparent) inch, disappeared also. The light must have been very powerful when it first appeared, for I saw the zoad, whEich was 100 yards off, as distinctly as in broad day. Your obcedient ca,-va,n

T1IE CANTON RIEva.-A few days since we referred to an official correspondence in the year 1847 on the subject of the operations in the Canton River; it will be rememberedl that Earl Grey, the Colonial Secreary, refused an application made by General D'Aguilar for a reinforcement of artWlery for Hongkong, and peremptorily forbade him to undertake any further offensive operations against Canton or the Chinese, without the sanction of the Government. The despatch is worth quoting*-
"The Goerenorof Ceylon." writes Earl Grey QlTov. 24th, 1847), "1has semmunicated to me an appication which you ha" 3made so the Major-General comraanding Her 3Majesty's troops in that island for a reinforcement of haf a compatiy of artillery with two guns and a proportionate eupply of amnmunitIon, to be held inreadincnn to be forwarded to Hong ong, should disunmstances render it necessary to undeztake anyfunrtber militaryoperations at Canton. I have desired the Governor of Ceylen not to send to Honteong the detachment for wbich you have made appication and I have further to signify to you that Her Mlajesty's GovermuentperemDtorily forbid yen to unijertake sany fuether offensive operations, against the Chinese without their previous sanction. Her Ma3jedty' Government ace satied that although the late operations In the Canton river were attended with immediate success the risk of a second attempt of the sme kind would far overbalance any advansace te be derived from such a step, If the conduct of the Chinese authoritiesshould,unfortunately render another appeal to arms inevitable, it wi be necesary that It should be made after due preparation, and with the employment of such an amount of force as may afford just ground for expectieg that the ob. jects which may be propoted by such a measure will be effectua-y accomralibed without unneceseary IOgs."
A copy of the above instructions was forwarded (on application) to Major-General Jervois commander of the troops in Eongkong, on the 2d of July, 1853, for his information and guidance, with a significant intimation of the opinion of the Duke of Newcastle that Major-General Jervois "should be reminded that he commanded Her Majesty's troops in Hongkong, and not in China."
THE AnEItrJEN U|NIVMSITy.-On Saturday afternoon three candidates were nominated by the students of Marisehal Coltege and University, Aberdeen, for the Lord Rectorsbip-viz., Lord Elgin, Lord Stanloy, and the present Lord Rector, Mr. Layard, M.P. It was intimated on the part of Lord Stanley that he could not come down though elected, and also that he thought a more experienced person should be chosen. It was not knowni Lord Elgin would agree to be present; but on behalf of hlr. Layard it was stated that he had intimated his readiness to do his utmost to promote the reform of the University, wbether elected or not h but thatif the students should prefer him again he would ie ready to come down. The feeling of the meeting was scaiiy to be gathered, from the confusion that prevailed, btut ultimately it showed itself very much in favour of Mr. Layard, although it is quite unusual, if not unprecedented, in tlse history of these elections, to have the same Lord Rector for three years in succession. Colonel Muir, Mr. Cosmo Innes, advocate, Edinburgh, and Mlr. Stirling, of Keir, have been appointed commissonera to inquire into the state of the college and university, with a Tiew to their reform,

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL.
Lord LYNDHURST appealed to the Lord Chancellor to postpone the second reading of this Bil from Thursday ssext, as it was almost impossible for him to attend on that day, and a right rev. prelate who took reat interest in the subject would also be prevented from being present.
Lord CAMPBELL protested against a clause which had been added to the Bill, without communication with the members either of the commission or committee who had considered the question, allowing the dissolution of marria-es without the intervention of any legal tribunal. Alihough he might not be in his place when the Bill was read a second time, having to leave London in discharge of his official duties on Monday, he should feel it his duty to oppo0e such an alarming provision at a future stage-a provision which he thought subversive of all morality and domestic happiness. (Hear, hear.)
The LORD CHANCELLOR said, the secoad reading would be taken on Tuesday, the 3d of March.
GUANO ISLANDS ON THE COAST OF ARKBIA.
Lord POLWARTH, in moving for papers relating to the cession of the islands of Haski Jibbea and Ghurzoad by the Imaum of Muscat, and their creation into a colony, .was understood to observe that the question of the supply of guano Was of immense importance to the agriculturists of this country, and not only should every source of supply be sought out, but care should be taken to prevent a monopoly. He also expressed his prise that the Commissioners of Emigration should have thme power of granting exclusive licences without any intimation being given to Parliament.
The Earl of CLARENDON said, there could be no objection to the production of the papers which had been moved for by the nob)e lord, as the Government was desirous of laying before Parliament and the pubhc the fullest informstion upon the subject of any islands supposed to contain guano, He. was fully impressed with the imnportance of the subject, and had been in communication with the Agricultural Society and other bodies, aid had sent circulars to various ministers and consuls of this country, directing them to ascertain as far as possible the existence of guano or nitrates upon any islands within their knowledge. With rescectto the particular islands referred to by the noble lord, t ey were first brought to the knowledge of the Government in 1854 by Captain Ord and Mr. Bell, of Edinburgh, as having been discovered by the former in the course of his voyages, hut who declined to say where the islands were situate. A communication was made to the Admiralty, and it was arranged that Captain Fremantle should take out Captain Ord and endeavour to discover to whom the islands belonged, and also, if possible, to procure a cession of them to this country. Captain Fremantle, acting upon these instructions, learnt that the islands belonged to the Imaum of Muscat, upon which he proceeded to visit the islands, but, ewing to tho weather, could only land upon one of them, where no guano was found, but some inhabitants, who stated that they were subjects of the Lnaum of Muscat. Captain Fremantle then applied to the Imaum, and that prince consented to cede the islands to Great Britain. Captain Fremantle afterwards examined all the islands, and reported that guano existed only in small quantities, and was of an inferiorSquality-in fact, that as guano islands they were valueless; but one of them, he was of opinion, would be useful as a coaling station. That particular island was offered to the East India Company for a coaling station, but the company did not think it necessary to accept the offer, and the islands then became a colony. Some months afterwards Captain Ord applied again to the Government, stating that, although the guano was rather inferior to Peravian guano, yet he was prepared to undertake the whole expense of sending out ships and employing labour to collect it, Provided a lease for five years were granted to him. ConsideriDg that Captain Ord was the person who originally brought these islands under the notice of the Governmeut, and that, according to the report of Captain Fremantle, they were of little or no value, a lease was granted. At the same time the Government announced that it could not be a party to the establishment of a monopoly in regard toso important an article as guano, whereupon Captain Ord wrote a letter undertaking that all cargoes as they arrived should be sold by public auction in cargoes or in lots to meet the requirements of all classes of purchasers. The Secretary of the Colonies had since then informed Captain Ord and his agents that that undertaking remained i orce, and it was only that very morning that a letter had received from the firm representing Captain Ord, statat they were prepared to allow all ships to load at the is
upon payment of a certain sum; he believed 21. pQr ton.
The Duke of MONTROSE said, he considered a royalty of 21. a-ton would be too much to give to Captain Ord and his party, and that it would have the effect of keeping up a bigh price to the consumer.
Lord BERNERS held a similar opinion.
The Earl of HARDWICEKE said, if Captain Ord was dissatisfied with his bargain, that would afford the Government an opportunity of putting an end to it, and of making a new one. The present market price of Peruvian guano. owing to the absence of competition, was 151. a-ton, and if that continued the article would probably become a monopoly, and Captain Ord would enter the market with advantages which were certainly not contemplated at the time he received his heence.
After some further conversation, in which the Marquis of SALmnyBnY, Lord POLWARTH, and the Earl of CL.Ruuw:oX took part, the motion was agreed to.
PROBATES AND LETTERS OF ADMISTRATION*.
The LORD CHANCELLOR, on rising to move the second reading of the Probate and Letters of Administration Bill, said, this was a subject which had been under discussion more or less for the last 20 years, and had occupied some portion of their lordships' time in almost every session during that time. Their lordships were aware that the object of this BiUl was to remedy evils, which had long been the subjeat of complaint, arising from the numerous petty jurisdictions which existed throughout the country, for the most part ecclesiastical, with reference to the granting of probates of wilLs and letters of administration. They were also aware that there existed about 100 different courts that had exercised that jurisdiction for some years past. There were many more in the country, but these were rather theoretical than practical blots on our judicial system. There was also a supreme court in each of the provinces of Canterbury and York, which had a sort of jurisdiction whenever the inferior court within the provinces had not jurisdiction by reason of a deceased person having had property out of the diocess in which he died. There were, therefore, two Courts of Prerogative jurisdiction, and there were the local jurisdictions themselves. Now, one great evil which had existed from time immemorial in consequence of this state of things was, that the local court had only jurisdiction if a person dying within the jurisdiction had no goods anywhere else. In that case the local court could grant probates and letters of administration; but these would be altogether null and void if it turned out that the deceased had bona noetailia out of its jurisdiction. That was a state of things altogether anomalous and inconvenient, and was, in fact, a blot on our judicial system, which successive Parliaments had endeavoured to find some way of remedying. There was another grievous evil in the constitution of those courts. They had all of them what was called a contentious juris. diction-thatwas to say, if in any diocess a dispute arose as to whether a will was a genuine one or not, this question was to be decided by the diocesan or local courts-courts which whatever might be their other merits (and it was no reflection upon them to say this), were scarcely competent to deal with matters which even the Courts of Westminster had always considered most delicate and difficult-namely, asto the sanity of a testator and his capacitv for making a will. The local courts had to deal with these questions, but practically he did not think that a very great grievance, because such cases might be at once transferred to courts in London, where they would be dealt with by skilled persons. There existed, however, this evil-that the procedure of the Prerogative Court was of a most cumbrous, inconvenient, and unjustifinble character-unjustifiable, he meant, according to modern and improved notions of what the course of judicature ought to be. All the extremely difficult and delicate questions to which he had alluded were decided, not by examining those who knew the facts, and whose evidence might lead a judge and jurytoasatisfactory conclusion on the subject, but by written depositions, by a mass of papers which were flung down before the judge, and through which he had to wade as he could. Now that was a most unsatisfactory mode of arriving at a conclusion on any point; but, if he had to select from the whole range of questions subnitted for Judicial decision those which were least likely to
satisfactorily decided upon written evidence, he should select tho eclass of cases coming before the Prerogative Court. He had been told that there were continually 50 depositions describing the testator as a person of sound mind, and 50 others on the opposite side describing him as totally incapable of maldng a wiU or of understanding any-
thmn hn.;.Sv1Jg WaboU it. The case wvas a very dific-alt _o_n_e,_ eveni witnesses cognizant of the facts wero before the Court
but how much more difficult was it when the Court had no means of putting questions which might occur to it, and had to form a judgment upon depositions any one of which, perhaps, looked as good as the other. There were a great number of other smaller matters which required remedying, but he would content himself for the present with those
two-namely, the multiplication of small courts throughout the country, and the inconvenient practice adopted in the larger court at London. The object he had in view was to get rid of this mass of incompetent small courts and to improve the practice of superior courts. No one could doubt that this was a legitimate and a proper object, and the only question was how far he had dealt satisfactorily with the matter in this BilL In the course of the observations which had falen from him in calling the atterntion of their lordships a few nights ago to the subject of ecclesiastical courts generally, heh ad had the misfortane to be met with remaTks which had not given him much encouragement, but at the same time he trusted he should satisfy their lordships that the present Bill had much to recommend it-more, in fact, than any other Bill which had yet been submitted to Parliament. In the first place, he proposed (and to this he imagined there could be no objection) to abolish all the existing courts. (Hear, hear.) Even supposing that the Prerogative Court were as perfectaz its most ardent admirers could desire, he thought it was the universal opinion now that the constitution of such a court should rest with Her Majesty or Her Majesty's advisers, and
pot with any eclesiasticol functionaries, however high in
oition. The establishment of a Queen's Court of Probate iad been recommended by s commission as well as by comnmittees ana ahe propriety of this course be thoeght could not be disputed. He proposed, therefore, to abolish all the local jurisdictions, cud to constitute one Queen's Court of ]trobate. NQow, he was *ware that the point on which lhe had the mlisfortune to differ from his noble and learned friends, and on which he still had the misfortune to differ fronn them (thouga, if their lordahips should be of a contrary opinion, the measure might easily be altered in this particular) was s to who should be the judge of this new court On this pointhe would say nothing until he had gone through the rest of the Bill, because he believed there were delusions prevalent in respect to it which a close examination of the ubject would be calculated to dispel. In constituting this new Court of Probate, he thought he should not be acting wrongly if he tried to make as little practical change as Esidble, and to preserve (where he could do it without mage) the existing rules and ractioe. He proposed, therefore that, subject to the exceptions as to the taking of evidence, wvhich he had just indicated, the present practice of the Prerogative Court should be adhered to by the Probate Court. Heproposed to give to the judge of the new court the power to make rubs from time to time, and to alter the existing practice, but it would be much better to start with that which would b_e intelligible to the func-
onares, because in order to exCude the notion that there was any desire to create patronagqiand to damage existing interests, he proposed that the gentlemen who constituted the present staff of registrars and other officers in the Prerogative Court should be ast first transferred to the new court, subject to the power of removing any who might be worn out or incompetent. The present rules of practioe would prevail until altered by thejudge of the court, woo would, to some extent, feel his way on the subject Then, instead of having disputed questions of fact tried in the iha perfect mode which he had just pointed out, they would in future be decided by oral evidence, taken either before the judges, or upon an issue and before a jury. Those acquainted with the practice of the Court of Chancery knew that it would be hard not to allow parties occasionally to fortify some point by affidavit, and this privilege would be concedel, but its abuse would be guarded against, and it would be competent to the opposite party to require the oral examination of those who made an affldavit. With regard to the great questions which would come before the court, he proposed that they should be dealt with in the well-known constitutional mode in ordinary use for the trial of disputed facts,-namely, by an issue sent down to be tried before the judges on circuit ifv whatever county the case arose. In a Bill which had passed through their lordships' House for the further amendment of common law procedure there was a clause enabling parties, if they thought fit, to have disputed facts in a court of common law tried not by a jury, but by the judge. To that proposalhe had noobjection 'whatever. He was not one of those who were absolutely and blindly enamoured of trial by jury; but he mnst say tha an experience of some duration in courts of law and of equlty had led him to the conclusionthat there was no really satisfactory mode, or, at all events, no such satisfactory mode, of arriving at the truth as by a trial by jury. Undoubtedly, there would be greatinjusticeoften done if a jury were not very much goided by the judge, and he was persuaded that unless the judge felt it to be part of his duty to make a summing up, as it was called, of all the material facts detailed in evidence, pointing out to the jury their bearing upon each other, there would be no satisfactory security for the due investigation of the truth. It was not that mere fact the the trial was by jury, but the union of judge and jury, which afforded the greatest security for arriving at a just conclusion upon the case. For this reason he proposed that either party might always declare for the trial of a disputed fact by a jury, and not even by oral evidence before a judge. As, however, it would be unjust to compel both parties, against their will to embark in further litigation, and to go before a jury, he proposed that, where both parties agreed, disputed facts should be settled by the judge alone. But this would probably be a matter of very rare occurrence. Questions, however, as to whether the testator was of sound mind, or as to whether he was at the time of executing the wvll under undue influence, or whether the will was executed with the due formalities, might properly be referred to a jury. The next enactment which he proposed was-and he b eggedto say that all these enactments were in the Bil when he introduced it the other evening-that unless a new trial were ordered the verdict of the jury should be taken as conclusive as to the question of sanity or the other questions referred to it, and aLso that all the common law rules of evidence should guide the court in trying the issue which might be raised. That was the way in which he proposed that sll great questions should be decided; bet there were also a number of smaller questions which arose not indeed dc die in diem, but from week to week,in which the practice of the court at present was to refer the matter to the decision of the judgequestions such as the effect of an erasure or of mutilation of the document, or referring to matters of that kind. These were the two great branches of business conducted by the Prerogative Court; and with regard to the latter branch he beieved, and that belef was founded upon the evidence Vhich had been given upon the inquiries which had taken place into this s=bject that it had been most satisfactorily conducted at Doctors'-commons. He proposed, therefore, that all that branch of business which he would call the noncontentious business should be left where it was at present, and that it should he left in the hands of the proctors a,nd advocates of Doctorb'-comrnons. IHe was aware that the question had from time to time been much controverted as to whether an exclusive privilege should be reserved to any particular class of practitioners, antd in the Bill of last year that course had not been proposed. There was some advantage, no doubt, in having nothing of tho nature of a monopoly, and it had been proposed last year that the proctors should be abolished, but with a compensation. He had himself assented to that proposal, but he was bound to own that further consideration and reflection had satisfied him that that would not be the wisest course to adopt. He believed that the compensation then proposed might have been easily arranged, and that it need not have entailed any charge ulpon the Consolidated Fund; but there would have beengreatdifficultyinsustainingsuch;n arngement,because a new set of persons would come into existence, and would say, why should we compensate persons who formerly charged too much ? His noble and learned friend near him (Lord Lyndhurst) had had the advantage of being able to effect great improvements in the practice of the Court of Cbancery, and in doing so it had been necessary to compensate various officials, and, although the sums which had been paid were of a very large amount, he believed that, on the whole, those alterations had been the cause of diminished expenditure. He did not, however, think, when the matter came to be fully examined, that a proposal to compensate a whole profession could be sustained, and he therefore considered it to be his duty to consider what evil might result from the continuance of the present system. Now, the sole evil was that proctors had the power of charging an unreasonable fee; but surely that evil might be met, by giving to some proper authority the power of diminishing those fees. On the other hand, both from the evidence taken before the commission and from conversations he had held with persons weilacquainted with the subject, he beheved that the proctors operated as a most useful intermnediate check between the public and the court, and if they were done away with it would be necessary to appoint some official persons to sift the matter before it came before the court, for the evil which might in many cases arise from hastily granting probate coald not be exaggerated. The proctors were a small body, of whom probably not more than 60 were in practice, all of whom were well known to the officers of the court, and there was consequently a greater security afforded for the proper conduct of the matter at stake than there would be if 5,000 or 6,000 practitioners were admitted to practice in those courts. With regard, however, to the contentiousbusiness, he could see no ground for maintaining a monopoly. It was well known, as regarded tho proctors, that they did not look to large cases for remuneration, but to the multiplcation of small cases, and it was only fair that in important cases the public should have a larger choice of advocates than was at present afforded to them by Doctors'-commons. He proposed also entirely to abolish the diocesan and district coarts, but at the same time he was alve to the inconvenience which would result to the public if persons were compelled to come to London in all cases. He was aware that some persons held the opmiion that under the improved system of communication
at inconvenience would not be very conpiderable, but he did not wish to render himself in any way obnoxious to the charge of promoting a system of centraliz,tion. What he proposed, therefore, was to retain 36 district offices, solely for the registration and proof of uncontested wills, and he believed that that would be found quite sufficient for convenience of distribution. In these district courts-as in the Prerogative Court-it was his mtentsox to preserve as much as possible the persons who were at present engaged in them; and he mentioned this because he was not sure whether his intentions in this respect were clearly expressed in the BilL He proposed that the district courts should have no jurisdiction whatever in contentious cases, but that they should simply register wills and give probate where there was no dispute about them. Cases in which there was any contention must be brought up to be argaed in the Court of Probate. He proposed that the origial wills should be filed in the districts where they were made. This was a matter of dispute, he knew, aud it had been urged that all original wills should be
fied in London, and that copies only should be kept in the country. Hoc thought, how ever, that this would be distaste.
xo ropl m hC ounry,andhe ropsed, therefore, that the orgn als should be kept there, bat that documents should be sent up every fortnight, giving in a popular form a list of all the wiUls proved, so that it might be known what -Ws were proved in the country, and that facilities might be given for examining them if necessary. At the
same time he thought that it would be desirable in extremely small cases that there should be some means of allowing contentious cases to be tried in the countrv; and he proposed, therefore, in cases where the personna estate was sworn under 2001,, and where there was no real
estate, if a question were raised as to the sanity or insanity of the testator, that the county court judges should decide the question. He now came to a nart of the subject on which he had no doubt there migSt be some difference of
Opinion. Probates of wills, as their lordships were aware, related exclusively to personal estate. In the recommenda-
tions of the last commission it was proposed that the distinctl, r which existed at present sbould be removed, and that
probate should be granted both for real and for personal estate. That was a subject on which he confessed that he had heard great differences of opinion; but the conclusion
at which he had arrved at last was, that to insist upon probate in the former case would be to impose an unnecessary burden upon the devisees of real estate, who did
not, like the legatees of personal estate, take what was devised to them through the instrumentality of an executor. In the case of a personal estate it vwa absolutely essential
that there should De some person in the character of an executor to realize all the property, to discharge the obligations of the testator, and to account for the surplus ; but if a
man died seised of one-or two real estates, and left them to
John Smith and James Jones, there was no reason why thosePersonsshould not at once go in and take poessesion, and there was no necessity that he saw f6r'any intermediate parson between him who died and those who succeeded to the property. Ho did not tberefore propose as a general rule that real estate should require any pro-
hate. But there were two moatters in which he tildprps legislation on the subject of real esktat. Whenpo this matter VWa discussed three years ago in their lordshipe' House the anomaly was pointed out, that, inavsmuch as probate dia not extend to real estate, this strange and hardly creditsble state of things might, and sometimes did, exist-namely, that a jutdge who had jurisdiction over the personalty miight be satisfied of the sanityT of the testator and grant probate of a will, wherea a.psry trying the question of the real estate mlight decide that he was of unsound mind; so that the same instrument inight be decided by two different tribunals, having jurisdiction over two classes of property, to be the production of a sane man and of an insane man. He did not think that this was a grievance of vavry patical nature, because it was one of rare occurrene. Tiwro caases had happened sinoe Lord Hardwickte's time,and another was now pending before their lordships' House in the shape of an a peal relating to a larg property, which was heard at their lordships'bar in JTulylast, and in which no judgment had yet been given. That case was as follows :-A gentleman, namedi Col. dlough, who h;ad been' formerly member for the county of Wexford, disd in the year 1842. His wido* obtained possession of personal property under the will to the amournt of nearly 150,0001., and afterwards the heir-at-law, having contested her right to the real estate on the ground that the testat-or was of unsoundmnind, the jury decided aLt the Wexford assizes that the deceased was of unsound mind, and the case was now under appeal in the House of Lords. In order to meet such cases he proposed, where the queston of .anity was legtimately raised upon a will, that the heir-atlaw should be cited, subject to such regulations as the judge might make, and that the question should thea be decided once for all. He proposed, further, for the convenience of the public generally, that in order to prove the passing of real estate, it should not be necessary to produce the original will from Doctors'-commons, but that the probate should be received as pim-nu facie evidence. He proposed, further, to give to those courts the power, which, in truith, he thought they had now, although it was rarely exercised, of granting administration pendenfe life and of3making an order with respect to the allowance to be given to the person-who administered. He also p reposed to provide a place of safe custody where living persons
might deposit their wills -without fear of casualties HE. now came to a point upon which he believed ther~ was considerable difference of opinion-viz., the appointiment ot the judge of this new court. Hepropod that thaLt judge should be one of the vice-chancellors. Ho was quito aware that that proposal would raise a great storm of opposition, because nothing was so unpopular, -whether deservedly or not, as the name of the Cotut of Chancery. (Hear, hear.) But, supposing that to be a well-founded objection, be did not transfer the business of the ProbAte Court to the Court of Chancery ; he simply said that one of the present judges of the latter court should exercise the functions of judge of the Probate Court, just as, tiUl the establishment of the Lords JTustices one of the -vice-chancellors was, by Act of Parliament, constituted the judge of the Court of Rieview. He would have had a much easier task if he had thought fit to propose the appointment of a new judge or the continuance of an oldl one wvith a large salary and a staff of officers. He had originally ro framed the Bill, but he found, when he inquired what the duties of this judge would be, that he could not honestly ask their lerdhps to pus such a Bil en the faith of his statement that a new judge was necessary. The judge of the Prerogative Court sat now upon noncontentiouLs business about 24 times in the year, or, at farthest, 30. The number of hours on each of these days did not averago more than two. During the rest of the time the judge was occupied in hearing andtrying those greatcontested questions of sanity or insanity and the like which the Bill proposed to sweeg away, leaving the judge nothing, or little else, to ~o than to dispose of these minor matters which maight be brought before him alwrost in modo domestico, and to direct the trial of issues as to the validity of wills by the courts of common law. His only other duty would be to direct a new trial in the event of a verdict being unsatisfactory. Now, without considering the subject of a new trial, hatd he or had he not made out a cae for saying that there ought not to be a new judge, if a judge could be got who was discharging judicialfunntionsnowinxsome other court, and who ha time to spare for the performnance of additional duties? He thought he had, for he was persuaded that the business -which occupied only 30 days in the year and about two hours each day would not be considered a duty that would warrant any Minister of the Crown in proposing the establishment of a new or even the continuance of an old judge. Where, then, could he find a judge fulfling all these conditions, except in the personi of one of the vice-chancellors or-as had been suggested by a society which had maade some very useful recommendations as to the aLmendment of the lawin one or mere of the common law judges? Now, he believedl that, whatever other difference might exist between a common law judge and a vice-chancellor, there couldI not be the least doubt as to the superiority of the latter in all that respected the convenience of the puxblic. The common law judges were obliged twice every year to go circuit, while the vice-chancellors were, comparatively speaking, always on the spot. He had heard it sugge-sted, and the suggestion would probably be adopted by the commissioners or the common law judges, that there should be three circuits, which, of course, would increase the duties of the common law judges.f Moreover, the functions ordinarily exercised by a vice-chancellor were infinitely more in analogy with those of the judge of the new Probate Court than were the fuLnctions exercised by a commoni law judge. Ho had no sort of antipathy to the common law judges; on the contrary, he entertained the highest respect for them; but he did not think that their habits or their practice would enable them to give thesamesatisfaction in noncontentious business as might, be expected from a vice-chancellor, who had been accustomedl to deal w~ith papers similar to those which would come before him inthelPrebate Court. Bat it was saidthiat his proposal would threw the Court of Chancery into arrear. Their- ordships were aware that Lord Truro issued a coinmissionto inquire into the practice of the Court of Chancery, with aview to its amendmenxt. The commissioners made a report, and a Bill, founded upon that report, for simplifying and shortening proceedings in Chancery, was a few years ago passed into an Act. All these who wished wl to the judicial establishments of the country would be glad to learn that the result of the chanige theni introduced had been of the most beneficial description. He had before him a return of the number of proceedings instituted in the Court of Chancery during the last six years. Last year the number was 2,792, the -year before it was 2,815, in 1854 i6 was 2,832. During the whole six years the number ranged from 2,500 to 3,000, the variAtion being so small that it mlight almost be accounted the result of accident. But what was the state of theecourts in the same period? Their lordships must no't imagine that he intended to attribute any merit to himself. His duty was not that of discharging the original business of the couLrt. That business was discharged entirely by the Master of the Rolls and the three vice-chancellors, and he should be doing injustice to those very learned snd assiduous public officers if he did not mention the fact -which ho-was now going to state to their lordships. The state of the courts was this t-Whereas, at the end of Hilary Terma, 1856, the causes which remained for hearing and disposa numbered 519, at the end of Hilary Term, 1857, they numbered only 24:5. Indeed, he should not be surprised ff he were to find before Easter some one or more of the courts having nothing to do. That was the case before Christmas, when, had it not been for the power vested in the Lord Chancellor to transfer causes from one court to another, the whole business before one of the courts would have been disposed of. He could not doubt, therefore, that there was ample titne for one of the vice-chancellors to take the work of the new Probate Court in addition to that which ho now discharged. He did not propose to give any additional privilege or salary, and he was certain that if the vice-chancellor to be appointed to the Probate Court should at any time be in want of assistance, the other vice-chan. cellors would glady relieve him of a portion of his othex business. This broughthlamto the last point with which he wouald trouble their iordsliips. He proposed that when a trial had taken place, if the verdict was unsatisfa-toiy to the judge of the Probate Court, it should rest with bim t-s direct a new trial. Suchi was now the case withi regard to all wills of real estate when an issue wvas directed to he tried in the Court of Chancery, and although, if the question were whether or not there had been any misdirection of the judge, a court of commnon law would be the better tribunal for deciding that point, yet the question whether or not there should he a new trial irn cases of this sort did not ordinarily depend upon whether thiere bad been a misdirection in point of law, butwhethertheverdict wassatisfactory or the reverse. He appealed to his noble and learned friend whether there had ever been any one function of the Court of Chancery more carefully or more satisfactorily discharged than that which related to such questions. He did not therefore see that there was any anomaly in trusting that discretion to the Vice-Chancellor. (Hear.) He had gone through the mnain portions of the Bil, and, although he had no right to ask their lordships to look at it, as it were, ad inise,icordicmr, he thought he was entitled to ask them to proceed with a friendly disposition towards the Biil, if 'he satisfied their lordshi that, whatever its demerits, it was far better cal. culate=t the wants of the year 1857 than any measure which had p receded it. In 1842 or 1843 a Bill of Dr. N~ichols on this subject was introduced, and that Bill fell to the ground. In 1841 his noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) introduiced another Bill, which proposed 27 Diocesan Courts with contentious jurisdiction, although there were no practitioners, and two Archiepiscopal Courts -the Diocesan Cou,its hapving power to send these cause to be disposed of in the Prerogative iCourts. 'The Diocesan Courts in the province of York might send causes to York, and if the Prerogative Court of York did not nokethem, that Court mighten the to the- Pre -
rogative Court of Canterbur-y. He thought the simple mode proposed by this Bill infinitely preferable to that of his noble and learned friend. His noblo and learned friend made no prevision for the taking of evidence sdil voce. It vas true he did provide that the judge, if he thought fit, might, after the commissions were returned, direct a witness to be summoned and examined, but he left the procedure as to evidence just as it was before. There was a power to direct trial of an issue, but bis noble and learned friend left the decision of tho question whother the verdict was satisfactory, or whether there should be anew trial, to the judge of the Court which directed the issue, who might be the diocesan judge, or the judge of the Prerogative Court of York, or the very good authority, the judge of the Pro. rogative Court in London. The last thing he should ever wish to do was to attempt to raise the merit of his Bil by depreciating that of another. All he desired was to satisfy their lordships that this was a better measure than any which had' preceded it. In the following year Lord Cottenham introduced a Bitl, and Lord Cottenbam's Bil was much more like the Bill he had now introduced. It constituted in the same way a Queen's Court of Probate, but he thought it gave to that tribunal unnecessary force and solemnity. -He had not accurately examined what took place between that time and the time when he had tho honour of receiving the Great SeaL He introduced a Bill in 1854 which passed this House, end that Bill differed materialy from the present, inasmuch as it did not consti. tute a Court of Probate at all He gave the jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery, to be exercised by the Chancellor directing from tine to time which judge should dispose of it lhuh it was an observation against the present Bill, he believed in theory that was the most correet course, But their lordships knew that they could not always attempt the best course--only the beet course within their reaich, He believed all multiplication of
Courts,bgivie them prticlarJurdiction tobe wrong in principle. He belierped the theory founded by the jurisi, that there should be a sufficient number of Courts which should bave j'urisdiction over aLI parts of the Oulpire, to ue nnimpeachable, and be thought it would havo beam better if that plan had in this inrtance been adopted. He had explained why he had receded from it Although the
T)dge ws the Vice-Chau¢eUor it was not in his chara¢ter as Vie-ChanceUor, bart because he had sufficient time 'to disebarge the duties of the Probate Court. The Bill of. 185t falledinthe House of Commons. Since that time twoBiUs had been introduced. A Bill was introduced in the last session withhis full tanction, by which a new Court was oonstltuted, but, as it was felt there would not be work enough, it was proposed to give to the new tribunal some of the fanctions of the Court of Chancery, such as the power of administering estates. The Bill also provided for eompensation of the proctors. He did not know that they would not hive been justified in constituting a new Court with a new judge, if they could not have.1ound a judge to discharge the daties of the oce. But since the introduction of that BUl the buseinsof the Courtof Chancery, had sensibly andgradujuy diminished. Therefore, assuming that it was perfectly right to make such a proposal in the last session, it was not right to propose it now. He therefore proposed, as he had already stated, that a new Court of Probate should be constituted, that one of the Vice-Chancellors should be tiejudge of it, that functionaries exer¢ising duties in the Prerogative Court should be retained, and also functionaries in the country, as far as possible; that it should exercise contentious jurdiadiction in all cases except very small ases, which would be disposed of in the County Courts; that there should be 36 district courts-whether there shonld be more or less was a matter of detail; that all non-contentious business should be there disposed of; that the original will should be depo6ted in the distrct court if proved in the distrct, or in London if proved inLondon; *and that there should be registers in London of all wills and also in the districts so a,s to give every facility of reference. With these explanations he begged to move that the Bil be X4ad a second time.
Lord ST. LEONARD'S said they were necessarily embarrassed by the constant changes in the whole form of proceedings which distinguished Bills on this snbje¢t. In the first Bill which the Lord ChanceUor introduced the wblle jurisdiction over tho Court of Probate was given to.the Court of Chancery. He endeayoured to persuade their lordilips to confine the juds *ontoaparticular judge, and was supported by his noble iseaiMed friend (Lord Lyndhurst), but was entirely opposed by the noble and learned lord on the woolsack. In the next Bil, introduced with the approbation of the Lord Chancellor, Chancery had nothing to do with the matter. There was to be a new judge, with a large salary, who -was to have general superintendence of the law as regarded probates and wils. He objected to the proposal to involve real estato in probate, and. he was glad to find that idea was now abandoned. The next measre creating a new Court of Probate with a newjudge, gave to that Court a general jurisdiction, and enabled it to assist in the administration of the laws relating to divorce and marriage. The present scheme, however, was entirely a new one, resembling the first plan of his noble and learned friend, which was to give to the Court of Chancery the whole administration of business relating to wills. It also adopted a suggestion which had been rejected when he (Lord St. Leonard's) proposod it, to give that particular duty to a single judge. He was not very favourable to throwing that business into the Court of Chancery, although he was not a man to speak against that Court. He knew that much abuse was levelled at that Court by those who did not understand its working, but he believed in his conscience that it worked admirably and for the benefit of the public at large. He knew no countr- which posse8sed judges who addressed themselves to their daties with more energy and ability than the learned judges who now occupied seats upon the benches of the Court of Chancery. At the same time he was not inclined to increase the jurisdiction of that Court, and he entirely objected to casting any merely formal business upon a single judge. If the figmres quoted by the noble and learned lord were correct, and that it was true, as he had iatimated, that there was not sufficient business to occupy all those learned judges, the remedy was to abolish one of them. It was only in 1852 that the Master of the Rolls and the Vice-Chancellors were called to perform chamber practice, the object beine to abolish the masters and to bring the judees and their chief cierks into continual contact, that insted of references to and reports from the master, which involved delay and expense, the constant communication between the judge and his chief clerk might allow the business to be disposed of at a far less cost than before. . That system. was found to work very weli, and he hoped would not be disturbed, and especially that there would not be cast upon the Vice-ChanceUors additional duties, of a nature which, they were told, did not require any great powers of mind. To throw such business upon a Vice-Chancellor would be to impair his efficiency and unfit him for the discharee of the higher functions of his office. He believed there could not be a greater fault committed than to throw upon the ViceChancellor additional business of that description. The noble and learned lord professed not to transfer the probate jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery; but if the particular Vice-ChanceUor to whom that busness was delegated happenedto be absent, as he must sometimes be. having the misruess of hi- own court to attend to, then, under the direction of theLordChaulcellor,the probate business could besesit to be disposedof bythe llasterof theRolls or one of tbe other Vice-Chancellors. Surely that was nothing else thain giving the business to the Court of Chancery under the directions of the Lord Chancelor? Then, again, appeals ei.her r;f law or fact were to be made to the Court of Chancery, and thence to that House. It did certainly appear to him (Lord St. Leonard's) that this was a Bill to hand over this particular jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery. Then, again, as to the judge who was to be appointed, what was the course proposed? at present there was a judge of the Prerogative Court thoroughly competent to decide upon any question that came before him, but who by the Bill would be releved from much of the business which he now performed to the satisfaction of the public. If that were done thejudge must be compensated or allowed toretainhis present salary. Aportion of thebardenxwaswilfutUythrown on another person, and that person was the Vice-Chancelor. T.iis was, in his opinion, one of the most unnecessary changes ever attempted to be made in the law within his recollection.
hy, he asked, should the people of :E:ngland be called on to pay a judge for doing nothing at a time when he was fiully competent to discharge his duties? Aud why, being so competent, should those duties be transferred to other hands ? (Hear, hear.) Then there was another great difficulty in the Bill of his noble and learned friend as regarded real estate. For the first time, and without any necessity, his noble and learued friend was taking from every heir-at-law to an estate in this country the right-the estiblished right, maintained at all times in courts of equity-of having the vahdity of a will adverse to his interests as heir-at-law tried by an isssne. (Hear.) That was a right vestod in every person in Biogland, without distinctson, whenever circumstances arose in which he might desire to exercise it, and he (Lord St. Leonard's) trusted it might never be taken away. At present everv heir-at-law was empowered to say, when his title was called in question, that he would not give up his right until a jury decided against him. [The Lord ChanceUor was understood to dissent fromn the view taken by the noble and learned lord of the Bill in that respect.] He (Lord St. Leonard's) had read the Bill carefully, and that was the construction which he put upon it. Again, if his noble and learned friend wished to have a probate on real estate, he (Lord St. Leonard's) had no doubt that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in addition to the succession tax, would soon find it a feasible occaion for raising additional revenue by means of a probate dacy (a laugh), notwsithstanding that already in this country real estate bore a greater amount of burden than personal estate. He certainly should have expected that the House would have been informed as to the amount of compensation to be paid to those who were displaced, and the amouut of salaries of the new officers appointed under this BilL How could their lordships judge of the propriety of the measare unless they knew what the expense of it would be ? It appeared that 36 Courts were to be established; those who presided over them having no contentious business, but simply registering willsin respect to which there wasno dispute. Now, it constantly happened that instruments catne before Droctors which, though not contested, were, as their exDerience taught them, involved in some suspicion or of dloubtful vahdity. In such cases-and they arose daily and hiourlythey were obliged to submit the wills to the judge, and take his opinion as to whether they should or should not be admitted to probate. Now, he wished to know whether the persons at the head of the new courts wonld be men of learning and experience, competent to deal with these questions, or whether they would be mere clerks or registrars, and it was for this reason that he should be glad to hear what their salaries were to be. The professmonal character of these persons was of the utmost importance, because in the country they would stand in the place both of proctors and judge, anld upon them, therefore, would solely devolve the task to which ho had alluded. He was unwilling to detain their lordships bg any further observations at this stage of the Bill.
When it camo into committee he should propose those alterations which he thonght would make tho measure more likely to succeed than it w.as at present. At tho same time, though he felt it impossible to agree with his noble and learned friend as to the particular provisions of this nieasure, he should be ready in committeo to do everything in his power to render it effective.
Lord LYNDHURST did not rise to oppose the seconid reading of this Bill. It had been his intention, however, to make a fow observations respecting some of its provis;ons, but on looking around tho House just now he had mnade a caloulation which was rather amusing,-he found there was just ono-third of a peer to each bonch (laughter)
the House was almost deserted]; and, as he did not care to addreesemptybenches, he should postpone his observations to a future stage of the Bill. He hoped their lordships would think that he was justified at this moment in not replying to the observations of his noble and learned friend on the woolsack. (Rear, hear.)
Lord CAMPBELL, like his noble and learned friend. was indisposed to address empty benches, but, as this wvould bo his last appearance in the House before going circnit, he
tbou;ht it necessary to say just a few words on the subject of this Bill. There could be no doubt at all as to the recessity of change, and his noble and learned friend might have saved himself a great deal of labour on this point. All rmankind were agreed here, and it was discreditabLe to the
lgsatue of this country that now, in the mniddle of the 19th century, there should exist all these Ecclesiastical Courts (though he did not mind their belmr
called by this name) with separate jurisdictiom, ard witf this doetrino of bona notabilia, nobody knowing whether a
probate was good or bad. That a remedy was requsired no one disputed; the only questison was as to the manner of Ip roeeding. .Yow, he had opposed the Bill on this subject Drought forward by his noble and learned friend vwho had just addressed the Moulse, and he confessed he was not at all satisfied with what his noble and learned friend on the
wooolsack nsw called upon theit lordships to agree. to. -The sunm ad substance of his proposal was this-that wherever therwasacontested probate, thento allintents andpurposes it ihould become a Chancery suit. When a case came before the Vice-(hancelor in the new Court of Probate he must always seoif thore were ground upon which he oughtt3 direct an issue to be tr:ed. Sould such ground exist he would direct an issue, just as in a Chancery suit. The case would then come before a jury, would go back to him, and he would have to say whether he were satisfied or not with theverdict. From hisdecisionthere would be an appeal to the 1ord Chancellor or the Lords Justices, justas there now was with regard to a Chancery case, and afterwards there might be an appeal to this House. Now, were their lordships of opinion that such a maohinery would effect any advantageous change if substituted for the present mode of proceeding before a very learned judge in the Prerogative Court with an ap eal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, wnsose judgment was final in the matter9 He could not conceive 'why questions of sanity of the testator or undue influence exeised over him should go before the Court of Chancery. Hianoble friend onthe woolsack, having ceased to be acomnlwudead having become the head of equity, appeared to beiong to that sect of perscns who wiLhed to see everything else absorbed by Chancery, who admitted thatthe courts of commonlawmight decide in a case of assault, or in a case of a cask of beer sold and delivered, but they should not be allowed any jurisdiction in a case of the constraction of a deed. Now, he had a very high respect for the Court of Chancery and for those who presided in it, but he had no desire to he absorbed by it. (A. laugh.) His noble a ndlearned friend should rernember t at All pesrons did not regard the Court of Chancery with the same favourable eye as he didhimself, and that, an point of fact, a great deal of jealousy existed as to this absorbing power of the Court of Chancery. In his opinion, the new co-art ought to be a Queen's Court of Pro. bate, guided by common raw procedure, and presided over by common law judge. Having enteredhis protest aains' this jurisdiction being added to that of the Court of ehaneery, he would, upon the present occasion, confine himself to expressing the hope that the Bil might be referred to a select committee, which he hoped would include his noble and learred f iend on the cross bench (Lord Wensleydale), and that it might come from that committee in a form which would accomplish those objects which all had in 'view.
Lord WYNFORD was convinced that the present Bill, though it had got rid of some of thc objections which had been urgedagainst its predecessor-namely, the scheme of compensation, and the danger of abolshing a class of men
.ho had conducted the business intrusted to them in the moat satisfactory manner, would meet with the same fate if this nev jurisdiction were confided to the Court of Chancery.
Lord VENSLEYDAALE approved of the principle of the Bill, and would postpone any observations wvhich he might nish to make upon it until it came ho be discussed in detail. HIe thought that the appointment of a vice-chancellor to preside over the new court was of very doubtfull advantage.
The LORD CHFINCELLOR briefly replied. His noble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's) had not, he said, accurately represented the provisions of the Bill, unless he (the Lord ChanceUor) misunderstood the meaning of his own clause, because no heir-at-law could be disinherited except upon trial by jury. Some objection had been taken to the a ppeal provided by the Bill. The reason why he had proposed that the appeal should be to their lordships' Rouse and not to the Privy Council was that there mightbe cses in which real estate as weU as personal might he involved, and he doubted whether their lordships would cousent that questions of freehold inberitance should be determined by the Privy Council. AUlthesewerematters, however, for the committeo, and even the great question of who was to be the judge might very well be decided there. In the3e qnestions he should be guided by the opinion of their lordsips, but he certainly did not feel justified in proposing that there should be a new salaried judge appointed when he was perfeotly satisfied that all the busmess could be done by one of the judges now in Westminster-halL The Court of Chancery was in no way concerned in the matter, except that one of the Chancory judges would exercise the funetions of judge of the newv court; and, as to the absorption or swmping of the Court of Chancery which had been referred to by the Chief Justice, he could only say that, even in his wildest dreams, he had never contemplated such a thing.
The Bill was then read a second time.

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE LN INDIA.
Sir E. PERRY presented a petition signed by nearly all the European residents in Bengal unconnected with Government, consisting of indigo planters, landed proprietors, and Calcutta merchants and traders, calling the attention of the House to the state of the company's courts in the interior, and deprecating the proposed measure of the India Law Comnuissioners, which withdraws Europeans from the Drotection of Her Majesty's courts, and places them under-the jurisdiction of the company's judges. The petitionersstated that the East India Company's criminal courts are the dread and terror of the people; are used as instruments of revenge and oppression, convictions in them are regarded as evidence quite as much of misfortune as guilt, and the public have no confidence in them. On the other hand, no merchant or capitalist in Calcutta will eveorhleondr invest money without an agreement that the contract shaln be solely under tait Uthe )rsiction ofe5rMajesty's eSupreme Coudrt, and capitherefore p rayed that the jurisdiction of Her Mfajesty's eourts should be extended to the interior.
TRANSPORTATION, &c., BILL.

TESTAMENTARY COURTS (IRELAND). In answer to 3Ir. DicAsy,
Mr. J. FITZGERA-LD stated, that it was the intention of the Govenment dtring the present session to in reoduce ^ measure for the reform of the Testamentary Courts in
ARMY PROMOTION.
Colonel SOMERSBT inquired whether, by the warrant of the 6th of October, 1854, a Lientenant-Colonel in command of a regiment, being absent with leave from his command for a period less than one month, loses that time towards the
tlree years of actual comusand necessary to entitlo him to. the rank of Colonel ?
Mr. PEEL said that, under the regulation of October, 185 4, an officer was requi'red to serve three years in command of his regiment to y him to hold the rank of Colonel.. The Horse Guards ad to some extent relaxed the strictnessof this rule, and allowed absences at the rate of one month in the year 'without losing tifme. Consequently, when an Gcer had served for three years, if his absencesduring
he three' years] did not3 exceed three monts, he was allowed to rise to the rank of colonel; if they exceeded three months, then he would have to continue to command his regiment for the period of the escess.
GUANO.
Mr. SCOTT inquired what was the date of the treaty whereby the Imaum of Muscat ceded to Her Majesty the group of Kooria Mooiia Islands, valuable for their deposit of guano; and whether there was any objection to lay the treaty on the table of the House? He said it was reported that the Government had handed over for five years to a gentleman named Ord three islands on the coast of Arabia, containing a large amount of guano, varying from 1,000,000to2,000,900tons, and estimated atthe present price to be of the value of 24,000,0001. He also wished to know, whether it was true that Captain Ord and otbers had been beaten off by the Arabs in their attempt to take guano from the islands?
Lord NAAS inquired under what authority the Emigration Commissioners granted to Captain Ord and others the exclusive rght of raising and exporting guano from the islands of the Kooria Moorla group; and whether the opinion of the law officers of the Crown had been taken as to the power of the Commissioners to grant such a license?
Mr. LABOUJCHERE replied that there was no treaty, but an instrument of cession, dated July 14, 1854 ceding the islands to the Crown. The Emigration Commissioners only acted as agents for the Colonial-office. Two of them were lawyers of great distinction and eminence, and it had always been the habit to employ them for sueh purposes. The Colonial-office was therefore answerable for any done by them. The Colonial-office had u- doubtedly given a license for the exclusive trade in guano in those islands for a limited number of years; but it had not been thought necessary to consult the law officers of the Crown on the grant, because it rested on the ancient and undoubtedprerogativeof theCrown;andtheGovernmentwith which the3noblelordwasconnectedproposed toacton precisely the same principles in respect to some guano islands off the. coast of Australia. Asthematterwasdeemedimportanttothe ajgroultural interest, he desired to dissipate any apprehenscon that in consequence of these parties having the monopoly in the guano the public would not be benefitted; for they voluntarily offered to submit to the condition that all guano exported by them should be sold in open market bya broker at iverpool, and he had a letter addressed to the head of the Government, in which they offered to allow any persons to resort to the islands to export guano on a moderate stipulated payment not exceeding 21. per ton. Therefore, in case the islands should turn out to be valuable for the guano, no doubt the agriculture of this country would be benefitted thereby. It was true that oertain parties who 'went tothe islands were dXisturbed by persons inhabiting the neighbouring COaSt of Arabia, and were driven away, bat protection would be afforded from Bombay. y
ENTRIES OF EXPORTS.
Mr. NEWDEGATE asked what were the reasons for an order issued in August last by the Custom-house authorities, enjoining all shppers of goods for exportation to make moreaccurate entries of goods exported, bothas to quantityand value, and wvarnmngthem that the suppression of such information was illegal; and what had been the result of that order ?
Mr. J. WILSON said the order was issued, not by the T'reasury, but by the Board of Trade, and he believed the faots to be these :-In the early part of August, 1855-and not 1856, as the hon. gentleman cmagined,-arepresentation was made by the Chamber of Commerce of Bull to the Board of Trade to the effect that they believed there was great laxity in the entries of the exports of cotton goods and cotton yarn, and they therefore asked the Board of Trade to take steps which would make the entries more correct. The Board of Trade communicated with the Customhouse on the subject, and the result was the issue of the order to the port of Hull, and, probably, to other outports. The only object of it was to procure more accurate statistics of trade. But it seemed that, although the entries were now more acecurate, there was very little difference in the result as to the quantity or value of goods exported, because under the previous lax system of entry the entries were sometimes above and sometimes below the truth.
NEUCHATEL.
Mr. KlINiAIRD) sked the First Lord of the Treasury when the conference on the Neuohaltel question was to meet, and whether there was any hope of the unhappy differenceswhichhadariseninconsequenceof the late aggression on Swiss independence being brought to a speedy and satisfactory termination ?
Lord PALMERSTON.-No speific time has yet been fied for the conference, but I berieve that all the Powers united with the French Government have been invited, and have assented to attend ths conference. With regard to the second branch of the hon. gentleman's question, all I can say is that the SWIBs Government have shown the areatestm bele moderation by releasing the prisoners, and 1eahinktere can be no doubt that the Ktins of Prussia, when the conference is opened, ril show toat he is animated by the same spirit, and that the result will be a satisfactory arrangement.
JUJDICIAL STAFF.-ITELND. In reply to Mr. NGsPIR,
hlr. J. t. FITZGERALD said that by means of wn arrangement betweenthe Irish udges one of them would remain in Dublin to perform the duties of a judge dittin in chambers, while the others want on circuit. That arrangement would obviate the necssity of a ner appoint-
THE BUDGET.
ADJOURNED DEBATE.
Mr. JAES f r GrEaOR then resumed the adjonrned debate on the budget. He disclaimed al party feeling with reference tothe financial statement, and believed that all the country and the House required was that,, while due regard was paidatoheconomy, the administration of publi affairs should be maintained in ef ficency. There could be no doubt that the country, taking its tone from former decisions of the Hlouse, required that the income-tax should eease in 1860. (Hear, hear.) If that was admitted he thought that it wasthe duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give the House some idea of what his estimates would be in the intervening period. That right hen, gentleman adjusted his esinance by the imposition of taxes upon sugar and tea. He (MIr. M'Gregor) was not a stroug advocate of those great changes which took plate in the finances of the cohntrfapon the adoption of the celebrated resolutions of Xovemher, 1852; but he rejoiced to say that the result ad been highly successful, Und he at the same time frankly eonfessed the intellectual superiority of these gentlemen who saw the wisdom of tbrogating the dutes on a multitude of petty articles, and of fixing attentionsupon those great artlesiof eommerce which in fact sustaied the revenue of the country. The resolutions of November, 1852, were passed by an overwhelming majority and he could not see why resolutions affecting the general policy of the country should be disturbed without some very substantial reasons. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's scheme of finance for the year 1857-S seemed to hold out a prospect of the income-tax being made perpetual, but the country was opposed to its perpetuation. (eitoar, har) he beleved that if it were continuedbeyond 1860 it would be found to be worse even than oppressive, dnJUSt, and inquisitorial, and that difflculties would aim e with regard to itcwhich had never yet been mentioned,
Notwithstanding the flattering manner in which the Firdt
or of the Treasury was received during the recess by the muerchants of Liverpool and Manchester, no sooner was Par. liament opened than a multitude of petitions from them wnere presented for a remission of the war income-tanx The Government found that they would be obliged to yield to
the generl demand for reduced taxaion, and new estimates werelframed which permitted the remission asked for by those petihtons. But those estimates did not afford a fup
crcum on whih the w eight of the country's obligations could rest. Hebelievedthateveryvotewould be against a deficiency and every vote mi favour of rigid economy. The expenses Iof the army and navy might be reduced to a point much below that at whieh they were dixed in these estimates. He had yet to learn why, during peace, we should keep up in
prpetuity such estabhishmuents as the eamps at Aldershott, wolchester, and the Curragh of Kildare. He hoped that the
House would, by adopting the amendment which had been
back the budgt, tahnd that suchh rlelductions* of expendture
asithe engagements of the country and the extinction of the income-tax in the year 1860. (Hear, hear.)
Lord J. RUSSELL.-I should have been satisfied with taking but little part in this debate, or even with giving a silent vote in favour of going into Committee of Ways and Means, had it not been for the speech which we heard on Friday night from my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford. I was one of the
olleagues of my right hon. friend (MIr. Gladstone) when he brought forward his budget of 1853; and I was not only
;passive and acquiescent, but I was a warm-I maysay, an ardent-supporter of the plans which he then proposed. My right hon. friend has said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has departed from the principles of that budget, that he wishes to destroy so far as in him lies the principles upon which that budget was founded, and to falsify the promise which was then in the most solemn manaer held out-that in the year 1860 the income-tax should cease. Now, Sir, I cannot but feel that these are grave charges (hear, hear), affecting no' only the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but affecting every one of th3 members of th&'Cabinet of which my right hon. friend (Ar. Gladstone) was then the organ ; and I feel that, none of the members of that Cabinet now remaining in office having risen to defend the budget with the knowledge which they have of its details and its purpose, it is incumbent upon me, as one who was a firm supporter of those measures, to disclaim in the strongest possible manner and to disprove so far as I am able the charges which my right hon. frien4 has made. (Cheers.) In saying so I only go as far as this, that I think it right to go at once into a Committee of Ways and Means without assenting to the proposition of the right hon.
gentleman opposite. I concur generaUy in the principles upon which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has founded his budget. (Hear, hear.) Into the details of his propositions I am not bound to enter, stiU less am I called upon to discuss the particular votes for Supply, because the question which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has now
tax in I860, nor did he believe that any arrangements 'which could be devised for tbat object between this time and 1860 would promote the true interests of the country. (Hear, hear.) The income-tax might be readjusted and made more acceptable; but it wouldbe a great iinanoial blunder wholly to part with a portion of our taxaton which was no more than the affluent clmses ought to
contribute. A fair and moderate income-tax ought to be I maintained as a part of our ordinary revenue, and as the keystone of afree commerdialpolicy, calculatedto benefitthe
poesessors of property as well as the working classes. If he I were a member of Parliament in 1.80 and his choice lay between remitting the income-tax and remitting an equivalent amount of indirect taxation, coupled with the remodelling of the income-tax, he should p,refer the latter alternative. Therefore, to speak plainly, he made a clean breast cf it, wisbing to practice no concealment, and, above all, to hold out no expectations to the country which he felt in his conscience would never be fulfilled. Thoughhe should vote on the first motion with the right hon. gentlemian the member for Buckin hamahire, his course woed stiU be perfectly consistent. (iJerisive cheers from the Mfinistorial benches.) It frequently happened that there were two motions before them, and that a member might be opposed to both. He had no alternative but to vote against the Speaker leaving the chair, and then, should the right hon. gentleman's resolution be submitted asa substantive motion, he should vote against it. (Renewed cheers from the Ministerial benches.) Hon. gentlemen on the Treasury bench night think this a peculiar course, but a member was often under the necessity of separating himself from his political friends. The noble lord at the head of the Government the other night led 13 or 14 of his devoted adherents to vote with bon. gentlemen opposite against the extension of the franchise. (Hear.) It would beof rgreat service to the country that the progre.s of this budget should be arrested, and he, for one, should not shrink from the consequences of his vote. He believed in hisl conscience, however, that the budget would be taken back. He heard some talk of the dissolution of Parliament and of the resignation of Ministers; but he had the greatest confidence in the pliancy of the noble lord at the head of the Government. (Laughter.) T'lhat noble lord was like one of those trees which weathered the greatest gales by bending to the storm (renewed laughter), and if the House only showed itself in earnest the Government would, no doubt, reconsider their proposals, and, by further reducing the exDenditure and omitting the increase of the duties on toa and sugar, submit to Parliament and the country a financial scheme better calculated to meet with general acceptance. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. NEWDEGATE contended that theHouse was placed in an entirely false position, in that they were asked to proceed in opposition to the usual practice in providing the finances for the year. and that the precedents which had beeii cited in justification of a departure from the ordinary practice did not apply to the present case, inasmuch as they were made under different circumstances. He would not Tote On the question of the budget with his eyes shut, as he vas, in effect, invited to do by the Government; in other -words, he objected to vote for the raising of revenue until tle Housa had had an onportunity of considering the estimates, for at present they were in total darkness as to the expenditure likely to be incurred in future years. He objected to the proceedings of the Goverinneut in this matter, tecause, instead of Simply proposig a resolution to remiit " the war ninepence," they brought forward a plan -which would bind the House to Provide the rEvenue for the next three years without knowing what was to be the expenditure in those three years. The course which the hon. member for West Norfolk proposed was in perfect conformity with the well-tried usage of Parliament. The right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford had announced his intention of moving a reduction of expenditure on a future occasion, and this motion therefore ought to have his support, for how could any reduction of expenditure be expected after all the money to cover it had been voted. The right hon. gentleman in his speech of Friday night had betrayed considerable irritation, but that might be traced to the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had discovered that there might be limits to direct taxation, and that vith a growing expenditure an increase of indirect taxation might he desirabe. The right hon. gentleman would have the succession-duty increased.
Mr. GLA.DSTONE.-I am quite sure the hon. gentleman vould not willingly misrepresent me; but not a single syllable feU from my lips which would warrant such an assertion. (Hear.)
Mr. NEWDE, GATE had inferred that such was the right hon. gentleman's desire from the foUowing passage of hiS speech:-
" There is, however, an item with respect to which I admzit the balance is against us. I estimated the successiontax at 2,00),OOOj., but we are now told by the right hon. gentleman that 1,3O0,000g. is the more probable sum, and therefore wve must deduct 700,(01. from my estimate as the esult of our altered position since 1863. But as the person npon whom the promises made to you may be said to rest I say the changes that have since occurred do not absolve a e in honour and In conscience from the duty of straining e' ery nerve still to maintain and realize those promises and empectations, of the benefit and fruit of which my colleagues and myself availed ourselves at the time."
(Iaughter.) However, the right hon. gentleman had shown himself to be mistaken in his calculations, and the next time I e was in the same Position his mistake might be on the other side. He should prefer, therefore, to look well into the estimates to See if they could not be reduced, so as to absolve the right hon. gentleman, should he ever be Chancellor of the Exchequer again, from the nece:sity of increasing the succession-duty, or proposing new taxes.
Sir C. WOOD.-It is impossible to deny, as my hon. friend has stated, that the practice of examining the estimated expenditure of sthe country bofore proceeding to fix the manner in which it shall be defrayed is the ordinary usage of Parliament, and it was the course which Her Majesty's Government originally intended to pursuie in this inftance. It was not by their own free will, however, that they adopted the course which has been pursued, but in deference to the general wish of the House, expressed on al sides. [" No, no," from Mr. Disraeli] I am certainly much mistaken if the right hon. gentleman himeslf did not say that it was indispensable that there should be a financial statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer before we proceeded to consider the estimates.
Mr. DISRA.ELI.-I am quite sure that I never expressed any wish of the sort. I am quite astonished at the Government for having taken this course. The recommendations which they received to adopt it proceeded from a noble lord and a right hon. gentleman behind them, not from me. I am not aware that any gentleman on this side of the House recommended this course. It is one of which I en. tirely disapprove, and I am certain I never at any time sugt ested it to the Government.
Sir C. WOOD.-Well, then, it was pressed oa us by my noble friend the member for London and by the right hon. member for the University of Oxford.
Mr. GL&DSTONE.-I beg the right hon. gentleman to except me. I never pressed upon the Government any such course. (Laughter.)
Sir C. WOOD.-My ears then have very much deceived me, for I thought that if I had heard anything it ws a strong recommendation from the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, supported by the noble lord the member for London, that a fmancial state. mnent should be made before going into supply. Nobody expressed the slightest dissent from that proposition, and there seemed to be a general concurrence of opinion in the House upox the subject. (Hear.) It was not the opinion of the Government, but thoy deferred to thegeneral feeling, and havingadopted this course weare bound to persevere init. We cannot, therefore, accept the amendment of the hon. member for West Norfolk-, any more than we can that of the right hon. gentleman opposite. We are bound to resist both these motions, and to cal upon the House to come to a decision on the main question. I must say, having listened with great attention to the whole of thin debate, that I never heard any motion supported so feebly as the motion of the right hon. gentleman opposite has been supported in this debate. I cannot congratulate the right hon. gentleman on the support he is to receive from the right hon. member for Manchester (MIr. M. Gibson), who says that he shaU not vote in favour of his resolution; nor can I, any more than other members who have preceded me, see what practical conclusion can possibly be aimed at by this resolution. If its object is to bring the right hon. member for Buckighbam. shire (bIr. Disraeli) and my right hon. friend (Mr. Glad stone)l into office together, that is indeed a practical conclusion. But it seems to me that no other result can possibly ensue from this motion, except a hindrance to Abusiness, the House being prevented from going into a Commiuttee of Ways and Means and a Committee of Supply, and there adjusting the national income and expenditure. InAtead, howerer, of alowing the House to do this we have a
maotion of an abstract oharacter proposed by the right hon. gentleman opposite; when that Is disposed of my right hon. friend (&Ir. Gladstone) has given notice of another, which lie might just as well move in Committee of Ways and Means as before the Speaker leaves the chair; aud if that fails he threatens us with a third motion about reduction of estimates, instead of going into Committee of Supply, and there proposing a reduction of the items submitted. Sir,
-we boast of being a practical people, but I must say that if any impartial person were to look at the intimations ,which have been given of the course intended to be pursued here he would be likely to come to a contrary conclesion. (Hear, hear.) In Committee of Supply and Committee of Ways and Means the expenditure might be settled and the tupplies voted; but instead of this we are wasting time in discussing abstract resolutions which can lead to nopractical result. (Hear, hear.) I agree with those who think the House ought to know what the expenditure of the country is, and my right hon. friend (Mr. Walpole) tells us that one practical result of this motion has already been shown in the altered tone of the Government upon this subject. Now,
1 beg my right hon. friend's pardon. We have never 3een allowed to express an opinion upon the estimates. Lot us gc into Committee of Supply asd we will justify the votes w e ask for; but we cannot be said to have altered our tone
regarding a subjectupon which we have neverhad tbeopporunity of expressing-an opinion. The only alteration in the
fstimates has been- in those which were volunteered on the first eight of the sessionly my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford, who on that occasion kindly -uadertook to perform the duty of Secretary for War, First
lA)rd of the Admiralty, and Chancellor of the Exchequer. ("- EHar, hear," and laughter.) I confess I was as-
brought-forward, and brought forward, as I beheve, in conformity with the 'wish of the House is that we should first take into consideration the ways and means-that we shonld endeavour to decide what are the prospects of our revenue and expenditure for the present year, and -what are the taxes which we wish to retain or diminish. Now, it appears to me, andI Ithink that the Houseand the countrygenerally must concur in that opinion, that the Chancellor df the Exchequer for this year had no ordinary difficulties to contend with. (Hear, hear.) There 'was, in the first placi, his obligation to check, so far as he was able, the inclination to extravagant expenditure which, under the name of " efficient establishments," is so strongly recorumended by the military and naval departm ents with which he is connected, and on beha If of which he must speak. There was in the next place the general desire of the country, founded on what Ithink a fair and equitable interpretation of the Acts which were pas sed at the commencement of the war, that what is called the "w ar ninepence" should cease, not at the time at which the technical terms of an Act of Parliament had fixed its cessation, but on the 1st of April next afstr the termination of a year from the actual conclusion of the war. There was the obHgation, as far as possible, to place no obstacles in the way of the total abolition of the income-tax in 1860. There was, besides, the obligation which, notwithstanding all that has been said, I beheve the Chancellor of the Exchequer was quite willng to fulfil, so far as the situation of the finances would allow-the obligation not to press hardly upon articles qf great consumption, and thns to cramp the industry or fetter the means of the poorer classes of the community. That was the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, seeing that such was his position, I do not think that he has done iU in proposing that the "war ninepenco" should be at once abolished; that, instead of 5d., 7d. should for a certain period be the Hlmit of the income-tax; and that other arrangements should be made for paying off the debts which the country and Parhament have contracted. But what says my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford (Mr. Gladstone) ? I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer was ih this situation, that if he had pro. posed very considerable remissions of taxes, such as have been granted in former years, it might have been said, " You are parting with the ways and means which farnish the revenue, and you will thereby make it impossible to provide for the cessation of the income-tax at the end of three years." Lf, on the other hand, he had provided for the supply of the revenue at its present amount for three years by retaining the taxes which must furnish it, he woould then obviowly have been open to the opposite charge-that he had not followed in the track of his predecessors since the year 1842, who had gradually relieved the trade and industry of the country. But what I should not have expected is, thAt these two charges, so opposite and so inconsistent (cheers), should come from the same person, and be uttered by the same voice and in the same speech in the counrse of our discussions. (Renewed cheering.) Well, Sir, with regard to that first question, which was one of the first charges, though I will not pretend to recite them in the order in which they mere made-viz., that here are no great remiesions of duties-I think it was obvious that you could hardly make those great remissions consistently with the purpose of keeping nlp the revenue, with a view to the cessation of the income-tax in 1860. (Hear, hear.) It was proclaimed in 1853, after a great deal of discussion had taken place in previous years, that there were two alternatives then open to the Government and to this House-viz., to endeavour to reconstract the income. tax, to make it more equal and more just; or, 'without pretending to amend a tax which Mr. Pitt and Lord Lansdowne had declared [themselves unable to improve, to consider it a tax for extraordinary emergencies, and to provide for its cessation at a certain fixed period. Of these two alternatives Parliament in 1853, at the request of and entirely concurring with the Govrment, adopted the latter. But then, if you have not that alternative, you must take care to maintain the revenne, to prevent your resources being so injured that when you arrive at 1860 you will find it a matter of positive necessity to keep up this tax. I remember that Sir R. Peel in 1845 very fairly placed the alternative before us. He said-" The tax having now lasted three years, you have now the means, if you choose, of allowing it to expire. The half-yer's payment stiU duedWil furnish the necessary pro. vision for the requirements of the year. But that is notthe course which I should recommend. I propose that you should take off some duties and lower many others which I think prejudicial to the people of this country; but then if you do that you must preserve your income-tasx.
In that state of the case this House preferred to maintain the income-tax. I think that that is very much the dlternative we have now before us. It would be utterly inconsistent in the Chancellor of the Exchequer-he would then expose himself to the accusation of having the insidious intention to break the presumed faith pledged for the abolition of the income-tax, if he came forward and said, " Here are duties on tea and sugar that I can part with at once; and there are many other taxes of an injurious kind on which I propose to make great reductions." But it is not only alleged that he offers no great and unexpected remissions of taxation; the ground is also taken that there is a departure from the policy adopted 15 Years ago, of reducing a vast number of small duties, simplifying the revenue, and collecting that revenue from much fewer articles. Now, I think my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone) gave a very imperfect account of the policy begun in 1842. No doubt that account was more likely to be agreeable to hon. gentlemen opposite, who,e ears my right hon. friend seemed to be rather anxious to please (laughter), than a more accurate description would have been. No doubt there were proposals to simplify the revenue, and either to abolish, or reduce to a very low scale, a great number of small duties; but that Tas not the principal merit of the budget of Sir R. Peel, nor was it its chief feature; and, indeed, some parts of that policy, especially with regard to many small articles, were, I think, even of questionable expediency. Bnt what I and others approved in that budget-and I include the present Chancellor of the Exchequer among the number, because I know he always subscribed to the principles of the great philosophers who laid down the doctrines of free trade -was the great diminution it made in protective duties the abolition to a great extent of differenti, duties, and the consequent throwing open of the road to much larger and more important changes. (Hear, hear.) I remember that at that time many persons interested in the subject came to me from different parts of the country. The ropemakers in particular complained that their protection was taken away from them; the boot and shoemakers said that their industry was similarly treated, the manufacturers of straw plait in the midland counties, the fishermen in the north engaged in the herring fishery, and various other classes, all came to me to represent the injury done them by these measures. My answer to them-and it was an answer which Sir R. Peel himself in 1847 deemed a just one-was that all these questions hung together; that if protection was broken in upon in regard to the articles produced by these artisans, other protected interests would soon be forced to yield; that it might be a national policy in the eyes of many, though I might think it a mistaken one, to protect all interests-the shuttle as well as the loom, the fisherman along with the sugar planter; but that to apply the principles of free trade to a number of minor branches of industry would pave the way for the final downfal of the whole protective system. I therefore told the dealers in ropes and shoes not to complain that while they could no 1onger sell their articles at protection prices they had to pay an increased price for their corn, because they might depend upon it the day would soon arrive when, the minor monopolies being swept away, the producers of corn and sugar would be equally subjected to the rdgime of unrestricted competition. Well, this result came to p-, and this, I think, was the merit of the policy of 1842, that it firmly dealt with these questions, and led to the ultimate establishment of free trade, the principles of which we all acknowledge, or nearly all, for I believe there were some 50 recalcitrants at the commencement of the present Parliament. (Laughter.) Now, has my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the ,--
chequer departed from those principles? Having been.
a Freetrader all his life, is he now about to betray them? Has be in any 'way inaugurated a new
poliy ? Far from it. He has done nothing of the kind. (Hear, hear.) I should certainly have been quite 'willing to spare a good part of his spech. (" Hear," aud a laugh.) I
did not concur in his observations 'with respect to ths tax on fire insurance (hear, hear), which appears to me an excessive and oppressive impost. Neither did I agree with his remarks on the paper duty; because I hold that all these excise duties are in themselves most injurious. (Hear, bear.) They stop, embarrass, and prevent manufactures
the also enhance prie; and it is no consolation to
toli 'when it is proved! that the page of S a,sjpearc or of Milton has a tax upon it, that the 'wrapping paper en-. closing an ounce of tea for some old 'woman in a cottage is affected, nda injuriously affected, by the same imipost. (Hear.) With regard, thereFore, o isurance and paper, I
shall be very glad to see those duties reduced to a very small amount. I ouite concur in tho pohcy, and almost the necessity, of noi touching now on these large subjects of revenue, w hen the mind of the House, and I believe of the country, is fixed on the income-tax. (Hear, hear.) But I
confess that I don't see the use (or, at least, if it is good in a Chancellor of the Exchequer, it is certainly not good in the mouth of any one else) or pronouncing pane&yrics on these very odious taxes as though they were In themselves
mentorious acts. [Sir C. Wood was here understood to make a remark.] I don't know what my right hon. friend says, but he was very anxious, I remember, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to get rid of the tax on
imported wool, and also to Abolish the duty on bricksand as a member of the present Government he will rejoice: I have no doubt, when the saato of the revenue enables us
to make further remissions of the same kind; but

Mr. J. G. PhILLIMORE could not vote for the resolution of the right hon. gentleman opposite, because he thought that if the Ohancelor of the Exchequer s-ubmitted a budget which was satisfactory for the current pear,hetwent asfar.asbhe ourht toydo. It ight have been well for other Chancelors of the Exchequer if they had confined themselves within the same limits. The right hon. nember for Oxford University had made an elaborate speech of four hours' duration, suggesting a long array of objections and difficulties; but after he sat down no one was able to tell what it was that he reualy wished. His barren dissertation was not ilumined by the faintest glimmer of a remedy for the evils he had pointed out. He had misrepresented tAhe budget from beginning to end, and preferred the rashest charges against the Chancelor of the Exchequer, which he could hardly have believed himself, and which were, at all events, not creditedl by any other member of the House. The right hon. gentleman saii that when Chancellor of the Exchequer hiyself in 1853 he had pretendedtocalculate for future yean. Bntwhat adbeen the result? The whole of his ingenious calculations had ben falsifiedbythe event; and e the righthon. gentleman assertecd that, because many members of the present Government hsd been his colleagues, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer was, forsooth, bound not to take warning hy his predecessor's errors, but to follow him in his blnders. The right hon. gentleman had incurred a heavy responsiblaly. After getting the country into a war an a usember of the Aberdeen Cabinet, he had done everything in his power to lower the lofty courage and the generous spirit of the British people. The other night He appealed to their love of humanity in regard to the tea and sugar duties. In 1841 the same individual made a similar appeal in favour of maintaining heavy duties on slave-grown sugar. It was true the right hon. gentleman had reconsidered his opinions on the latter, and, indeed, on most other subjects; aind there was no reason, therefore, to desrair of his yet coming to the same conclusions on this point as the presentt Chnciblelor of the Exchequer. Omitting al notice of the immiense expansion in our exports, the
ht hon. gentlemen on Friday drew a portentous picture future fOinancial embarrassments, endeavouring to stir the House into suchi a panic as might indue it to fling itself into his own aris and those of his new supporters. The panic must be violesit indeed that could drive the House to such a desperate resolution. ("Hear," and a laugb.) Tenfold the right on. gentlemian's official experience or skill in debate, tenfold his confidence, which was certainly great, would not atone in the eyes of the people of this country for the obliquity of his conduct. That had inspired them with invincible distrust. On the Ministerial ,ide of that House he was looked upon as an uncandid aement on the otlier ide those who did not lightly change
r tinions regarded him as a treacherous friend; while by u tis f bllow-countryhtn. out of doors, in spite of his frequent appeals to his own conscience and to their hitnanity he would ivd himself viewed as an tunsafe guide and a most unscrupulous partisan.
Mfr. WHITESIDE bad an objection to offer to the budget, not because it was inconsistent with sound finance, but because it w-as opposed, in one respect at least, to com.mon. honesty. A document, signed by many respectable merchants of Belfast, i5ade this declaration to the Homue, that they had been intduced, not merely by the positive enactmients of the law, hut by a statement that recently came from the Treasury, to eu,bark their capital in a particular trade, under the bief thatwthe Acts now in existence would be 1Irniitted to take their course, whereas the Government, having entrapped them into this traae, now very coolly turnedt round and reversed its policy to their ruin and destruction.

The hon. acd learned gentleman who a spoken last seemed to think that it was part of the duty of the Opposition not only to point out the defects of the budget, but to showp ho.w they m eight he obviated. A similar remark had beeni ordce muade by a former Chancellor of the Exchequer to a severe criticizer of his financeial plan, and the answer whiclh beg ot was that before his opponents could be expected to corrEct his errors they miust e called into the Cabinret. (Hear.) The noble lord the memaber for the city of London, by adopting the figures of his right hon. friend the member for Buckshusas given the strongest possible proof of the neceasity for such a motion. The noble lord was certainly the last oan in the Rrouse whom he should have expected to ficd speakig one way and voting another; but perhaps whei the House caIn' e to the discussion of wdha the noble lord eakilt the " Chinese folly`"-'Chinese crimne" would be the lkt~ter nanie for it - his course wvould be different. The hon. ad learned gentleman who had just sat down was loud in his denunciation of eiconsistency in politicians ; and it was not easy to see how he reconciled thin hatred of inconsistency with his devotion to the noble Premier. In
hicgh of the noble lord's characters was it that he foutd so muci oatter for admiration? Was it as a decided Whig, an enthusiastic Tory, or as a mnixture of al three? (Hear, hear.) That speech certainly came itith a very ill grace roni the ardeot so tpporter of a Government which had one policy for England, another for Irelahd, and solie other policy for foreign affairs. (Hear, liear.)
Sir F. BA.th IG thought the anecdote quoted by the lion. and learned gentleman who had just sat down let out the real obiject of the txotion. h on. gentlemen opposite would not berat al answerable for the finances until they were
caon;ed in," and then, of course, al wouid be very soon set right. (" Hear," lad a laugh.) It was singular that the motion of the righi hon. gentlemnan did not contain any mention of what he eranta to do with the war incoineOtax-whethe r he wished it to be repealed or not. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could not he expected to frame bsis plan for tse year with anythiing like certainty unless the House gave a decided opinion one way or the otlier on this point. At the beginninig of the session, wheon it was thiought that the Giovernment did not mean to take off this part of the t,,x, the righit hon. gentleman expressed his deterudnation of bringitig the question to a speedy decision ; but niow nutsa word was said shout it in his resolutioni. The irstiression left by h-is speechi was that he intended to kceel1 it on for another year, at all events ; hut if that were not so, wetiy did he a',t state it in his resoluition ? (Hear.
hear.) Was it that there was some little difficulty in recon; ciling the two schools wbich had united to support this resolution ? Could not the gentlemen on one side of the Houise he brought to assent to the real intentions of the gentlenien on the other side ? (` Hear," and a laugh.) It was important to consider what was the real position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The proposed reduction of the income-tax would involve a great diminution of revenue. and the total reduction of revenue-includin2,200,0001. for the malt-tax, 1,500.0001. for tea duties; 135,0001. on coffte, and about 755,0001. for sugarwould be 'some 15,500,0001., if the Chancellor of the Exchequer considered himself bound to perform all the promises that had been made by his own and previous Governments. Tho national income last year was about 73,000,0001., and if they deducted 15,500,0001. froni that amount, the income would be reduced to 57,5O,GO01. The expenditure for 1857-8 was estimated at 65,C00,0001., and there would therefore be a deficiency of s,000,0001. In the following year there woould be a still more considerable deficiency, amounting, probably, to 9,000,0001. He thought a finance Minister who had to deal witsh circumstances of so much difficulty was entitled to sorne cfmsideration at the hands of the Hlouse. (Hear, hear.) he present Chancellor of the Exchequer was not sltogtther responsible for the arrangements affecting the income-tax and the tea and sugar duties, and he had nothing to do with the abolition of the malt tax. His right hon. friend (the Chancellor of the- Exchequer) was nOW called uVon to fulfil all the engagements which had heen made with regard to those taxes, and he must say he thought the right hon. gentleman had most matdully encountered the difficulties of his position- (Hear, hear.) It had been so that in the proposals he had made the Chsncellor of the Exchequer had entirely abandoned the principles of free trade, and on that gruund he had received a most severe scolding from the right hon. member for thte University of Oxford. (A laugh.) He (Sir F. Baring)
,cernli sAW ao easonltoimtppcee thst tihe budget of the Chineollor of the Exchequer evinced an xymptom of abandonlng freet adeprinciples. (Rear, hear.) The right lon. gentleman had shown no special love for indirect taxa7tion, for he had refused to reduce the income-tax from 7d. to . d,,wlhile ke had consented to the reduction of 3the coffee duty. The right hon. gentleman said that, with tegardto augr and tea, he could not fulfil the promiseWbidlihe had lnade; butthat he would go as far ashelan ces of the country allowed, and thatn 1861i ewould be prepa ed to maake thefull reduction which he had promised. It was said there was no prospect of getting rid of the income-tax in 1860 ; but he (SirzE.-Baring) thought that political reasons, as well as the maintenance of good faith, should induce Parliament to!do ald in their power to fulfil the compact which had been made, and to ablh the tax in 1861. WCeers.) If that tax was not removed in 1861, he feared there was no chance of its ever being abandoned. ("Hear," and a laugh.) Tn 1860-1, in consqence of the reduction of interest upou the national debt the faling in of annuities, there would be a reduction of charges upon the revenue amounting to about 4,700,0001. The income-tax would wield aoout 7,000,0001. The succession duty, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated, had not yet reached its smaximum, and it would probably yield in 1861 from 6OO,000 . to 700,0001. Theso amounts were not equal by nearlyl 2,000,0001.. to the amount which would be derived from income-tax; but it must be remembered that in 1861 there might not improbably. be an increase of revenue and a diminution of expendituwe. He thought the case was not quite so hopeless as some hon. gentlemen represented. If the Government kept the revenue in a fair state and avoided wars,he saw no reason to despair, or to doubt that it was in the power of the Government to take off the income-tax at the period when Parliament had determined that it should expire, by a little arrangement of the finances. It was argued that between that time and the present the revenue would not be equal to the expenditure. He quite admitted that, if the income-tax were reduced as proposed, and if the expenditure of the present year were m aintained, with the additional charges of the civil service,there would beadeficit next year. He did not consider it an unfair statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he said that the present was not a yeaz of permanent pesce establishments, and that.Parliament might look forgard to some reduction of expenditure in future years. If, as he believed his riaht lon, friend had fair reason to suppose that the expenditureihould be reduced to such an amount that itwvould hemetby the income, there was no reason to charge him with a dereliction of duty in the propositions he had submitted to the House. He agreed with tbose who thought there was reason to suppose thatthe expenditure might be reduced, and that it was not deirable to seep up a great war expenditure in time of peace. But having served the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer himself, and having had a great deal to do with reductions he knew that it was difficult to make reductionsimmediately, and that those that were made immediately were not real, but usually cost a good deal more next year If he referred to the expenditure of 1847-8, which was ayear of peace, he found that the expenditure was not so extravagantly below the expenditure of the present year, for he found the expenditure (not the estimates) of 1847-8 for the army, navy, and ordnance were within 1,000,0001. of the proposed expenditure of his right hon. friend. Considering that we were just coming out of a great war, and that we could not expect everything to be done in a day, he thought tbe House and the country mustgive the Governmentcredit for having made alarge reduction, and for offering an earnest that the expenditure, more especially when the Chancellor of the Exchequer said there would be a deficit if a further zeduction were not made in the expenditure. Let the House, then, go into the estimates. (Hear, hear.) If reductions could be made in the estimates let the House consider the estimates and make those reductions. (Hear, hear.) He was happy to hear a cheer from hon. gentlemen opposite, and he should be happy to carry out every practicable economy; but let the economy be impartially carried out. A large number of workmen had been discharged from Portsmouth dockyard, and representations had been made to him in consequence. He had nothing to say against the reduction if it were de. manded by the exigencies of the public service, but let care be taken that what was saved with one hand was not unnecessarily spent with the other. If they reduced the estimates at Portsmouth ought they not to stop on their way at Aldershott ? (Hear.) Let the public have fair play, and don't let Parliament increase, under the superannuktion allowance, the salaries of some of the best paid and permanent officers of the Crown. (Hear.) Last year a Bill passed for transferring 120,0001. from the county-rates to the public revenue for keeping uxp the police. Now, hon. gentlemen opposite were very snxious for reduction, and if they would bring forward a motion and oppose that grant he should be happy to vote with them. (Hear, hear.) If the House should go into committee and carry the proposals of the Government he hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be obStinate in resisting the demands for expenditure, and that the House would stand by him, remembering that it was a question between economy and the expiration of the incometax in 1860 On one side the question was between kindness and humanity to certain classes, and on the other heavy taxation on the people. Hle, for one, should be quite ready to help his right hon. friend in keeping down the expenditure, sO that he might be able to give up the income-tax when [ the period expired for which it was voted by Parliament.
(Bear, hear.)
Mr.WALPOLE.-In common with the rest of the House, I have listened with unfeigned pleasure to the right hon. gentleman upon a subject with which he is so perfectly conversant as the financial arraugements of the country, and I own I felt, after hearing his speech and the speeches of three other gentlemen, one of whom is, and two of whom have been, Chancellors of the Exchequer, that it would show some presumption on my part-indeed, considerable presumption-if I were to enter into a discussion with them upon a topic which they understand so much better than I do. Bat in the few observations which I shall make I shall confine myself strictly to the specific proposal that is now before us, and, confining myself to that, I am happy to say that I agree in the main object which the noble lord the member for the city of London appears to have in view in reference to this matter. I agree with some of the means-with many of the means-by which the noble lord proposed to attain that object, and I only differ from him as to the conclusions at which he has arrived. Agreeing with him in the main object we ought to have in view, and also as to many of the means by which that object ought to be accomplished, I cannot conceive how the noble lord could have arrived at the specific conclusion to which *he has come -viz., that we ought to go into a Committee of Ways and Means for the purposes set forth in the resolution of the Chancellor of the Exchequer before we have obtained the information which the noble lord thinlrs it is essential we should possess, in order to be sure that we can effect the object which he and the right hon. member for Portsmouth have both in view-the abolition of the income-tax in 1860. (Hear, hear.) Seeing that to insure that object we require to have a thorough revision of our expenditure in order to see whether it is not necessary this year, and in the follow. ing and succeeding year, to carry out a wholesome reduction though not a niggardly economy, I confess I cannot understand how the noble lord should take the course which he has recommended to the House. Tho first step taken in a Committee of Ways and Means would be to reimpose the income-tax in the years 1857-8, 1858-9, and 1859-60, and that without our having the meaus of knowing what is to be the expenditure in any of thoseoyears. (2Iear, hear.) Now, I think, that to pro. pose taxes to meet the expenditure of future years without knowing what that expenditure is to be, is the very reverse of the course which we ought to pursue. (Hear.) The noble lord said at the commuencement of his speech that the minds of the people of this country were fixed on the remission of the income-tax in 1860. I think when Parliament met there were three expectations which the people of this country had formed on this subject, and these expectations I believe to have been fair and reasonable. The first was, that the war part of the income-tax should cease when the object for which it was imposed had passed away; the fecond was, that now we were at peace we ought to reap the benefits of pea.oeby a reduction of the expenditure occasioned by the exigencies of the war; and the third was, that the remuainder of the income-tax, after doing away with the war part of it, should not be continued contrarytotheengagements entered into in 1853, unless an overwhelming case of necessity were made oat. (Hear, hear.) The first of these expectations has been realized by the concession of the Government. Whether that concession was made spontaneously by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or wbether it was forced on him by strong manifestationrs of public opinion, and by announcements nade in this House,
will not stop to inquire; bat I hope that being given up there will be neither the inclination nor necessity for rein,posing it for many long years to come. (Hear.) The other two points of expectation,-viz., the reduction of expenditure and the ultiziiate abolition of the income-tax, are the points on which I now wish to address the House. When we have heard from the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that there is a vast disproportiou between the expenditure of the present year and that of 1853-54, 1 think
tnis House would grossly neglect its duty if it did not reouire a distinct reason for that increase of expenditure. (Hear.) I agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in one observation which he made. I admit that the transition fromn a state of war to peace always leads to considerable difficulties- possibly, I might add, to niuch embarrassment. The reduction of establishments is neither an easy nor a pleasant matter. The hardship of throwinig out of employment those who have served the country faithfuUy and zealously is strongly felt, and no one would wish to carry out such a step except from a sense of imperative duty. I would further add that there is the danger of reducing esta bhishments too low *n the one hand, or of running into the other extreme, which, after the extravagancies of war, you are greatly tempted to do. These are considerations which may naturally have made the Government hesitate before they determined on the exact point to which the expenditure should be reduced. But at the same time, allow me to remind the Government that nearly a year has passed since the war term,inated, and that they have had 12 months' preparation to consider what the exigencies of the public service require, and to inform this Hlouse what ought to be the nature and character of our peace establishments. The Government were warned ofthis in May last. My right hon. friend the memberfor Buckinghamshirepointed ontto them that since the excitement of the war was over they must look to a wise and rigid economy (hear), and the right hon. gentleman who has just sat down (Sir F. Baring) spoke in still stronger language, for he said this House would caU strongly on the Government to have recourse to those practices of economy which last year could not be carried out. The warning, therefore, was given; bat whathas been dooe? At this moment the Honse is totally uninformed whether the peace establishments we require shall mount u to the estimates of the present year or be reduced to the level of the estimates of 1853-54; and before we proceed further I hold that the House is entitled to have informa-
tion on the *poits. (Hear.) Wo doubt, In dealing with the question of retrencbment there are many difficulties that stad in the way; but I wish to observe that retrenchSnent sieed not be confined to the militarv and naval estabbsbroents. (Hear.) I agree with the right hon.baronet the inember for Portsmouth that the most a3arming thimg in our expenditure is the rapid advance of the miscellaneous estimates. (Hear, bear.) These are matters that require to bo looked into; but even with renard to the military and naval establisbments the opject we ought to have in view is to combine efficiency and economy together. (Hear, hear.) I do not concur in the observation so common both in and out of Parliament, that it was the want of expenditure in these establishments that led to our disasters during the winter of 1814-45 in the Crimea. LO we look into the cause of these disasters, we shall trace them, not to the want of men or of money, but to the want of foresight in those who planned the campaign, and to the want of experience which must attacn to any army, however powerful, that has long been reposing in peace. (Hear, hear.) Why do I say this? When the army went to the Crimea it was more numerous than that of our gallant allies; and when we left off the war-and I speak it in the presence of thegallant general who -was last in command of that army-the British force was in point of numbers, in point of spirit, and in point of efficiency, equal to that which in 1815 was encamped on the plains of Waterloo. (Hear, hear.) These are two remarkable facts; and they incontestably prove that by husbanding your resources in time of peace you are much better able to carry on a severe and protracted struggle, when it comes, than those nations who waste their energies and expend their strength in establishing unnecessarily large-armies. (Hear, hear.) Wnat, therefore, we want is en efficient but notasuperfluous force-asmuch efficiency and as little extravagance as you are able to give. (Hear.) But, Sir, what is the state of your estimates for the military and naval establishments now compared with the expeiditure for those services in the years 1853 and 1854? The inctease is upwards of 3/000,0001. I do not say that part of that increaso may not be required, especiaUyat the present moment, when you have to get rid of the "tail" of the war expenses, as it is called; but I very mach doubt whether those establishments will really be better by continuing the expenditure at that amount. It is your duty to provide a sufficient force for your defences at home, and for the regular relief of yourgarrisons abroad; butfrom the moment yonget beyond that Doint your expenditure 'wiU become a source of weakness and not of strength. (Hear, hear.) But it is not only to the naval and military establishments that, in justice to those who sent us here, we ought to look for a reduction of expenditure. We ought to examine still more narrowly our civil departments. I am not for any undue reduction of expenditure; but when the fact is brought strongly before us that the expenditure required for the first year of peace is, all services included, 10,000,0001. more than the expenditure in the four yearsbefore the war commencea, I feel that it is impossible to deal with this subject properly unless we carefully inquire into the causes of that expenditure. (HIear, hear.) I am willing to admit-because r think that this question should be discussed as my right hon. fiiend the member forl3uckringhamshire discussed it, strictly from a financial, and not from a political or party point of view-that there are several items in that expenditure which are necessary consequences of the war. The winding up of the war expenses is alone a considerable item, and probably the details of it will be given to us by the FirstBord of the Admiralty and by those who move the army and Ordnance estimates before the conclusion of these discussions. You have also a further sum of 2,000,0001. for Exchequer-bonds -a mode of borrowing money, remember, to which we on this side of the House have always objected because we knewthatyounwouldhavetorepay them just at thetime when it was least convenient to do so. You are also under the necessity of providing for the sinking fund. All these items, taken together, may reduce the excess of expenditure for the presentyear as compared with the expenditure in 1853 from lO,000,0001.,whichistheappauentincrease,to6,000,001. or 7,000,0001. Stil, I say, in that excess of 6,000,0001. or 7,000,0001. over the expenditure of the peace years there is good ground for thinking that considerable reductions may be made, and until those reductions are made we cannot tell whether the reimposition of a portion of the income-tax and the increase of the duties upon tea and sugar will or will not be necessary additions to the taxation imposed upon the country. (Hear, hear.) So much, Sir, for the question of reduction. But the point upon which I own I feel the strongest-the point to wbich I never can consent in the financial arrangements that are now proposed to us-is the way in which you are going to deal with the property and income-tax, because I am confident that if you deal with it in that mauner it will he perfectly impossible to take it off in 1860. (Cheers.) The noble lord the member for the city of London thinks that it will be possible to abolish the tax in 1860, and ]as stated hisreasonsforarrivingatthatconclusion. Ishall advert to those reasons, with the permission of the House, before I have finished; but, in the meantime, I wish to deal with one portion of the subject which has been often alluded to in this debate, and which I believe to be more important that any other as far as the honour, faith, and character of Parliament are concerned. We are bound, Sir, to keep our engagements with the people. (Cheers.) I deeply regret that my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer sbould, on the first aunouncement of the budget, have dealt with this subjectas if there could be no compact excepting that which the right hon. gentleman the member for Portsmouth called this evening a " legal" compact. The Chancellor of the Exchequer seemed to intimate, at least by implication and by way of illustration, that there could be no compact made with the people short of one similar to the union between England and Scotland and between Great Britain and Ireland. In my opinion, though there may not be a legal or an actual compact, there may be a virtual or moral compast which cannotbedeparted from without a Yiolation of faith. (Cheers.) If such a compact be entered into-and such I hold is the case of the income-tax-then I deliberately say that unless that compact is LfaithfuUy observed there is an end of all confidence between Ministers of the Crown in proposing measures, and you as representatives of the people an acceptingand adopting them. (Cheers.) There are many ways in which a moran compact may exist. The compact may be caused by ai Minister of the Crown, in his place in Parliament, making an announcement as tbe foundation of his proposition, and Parliament accepting it in the sense in which it was made and acting upon it afterwards. (Hear, hear.) There is such a thing as a compact founded upon general arrangements, with a mutual consideration running through tbem, whereby parts are assented to which would have been opposed for the sake of others which ought to be accepted. (Hear.) There may also be a moral-I had almost said a legl--compact, when you embody announcements from a Minister of the Crown specifically in the provisions of an Act of Parlia'nent. (Hear, hear.) Nlow, I . every one of these circumstances appears in the case before us. I shall not trouble the House with reading them, but I have here a note of the considerations which were so emphatically urged UpOn usin 1853 by the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxford University. (Hear, hear.) He first stated his own individual opinion; he then showed the impracticability of retifying the tax, and he concluded by annoaneiDg, in the name of the Government-there can be no doubt upon that point (hear, hear)-that the tax should expire in 1860, and that he should make provision expressly for that purpose. (Cheers.) But look at the mutul considerations which ran through and pervaded those general arrangements. You extended the income-tax to Ireland (hear, hear); you imposed it upon those whose incomes were below 1501. and above 1001. (hear, hear), and you passed a general measure which brought a tax upon every family in the kingdom which succeeded to any property of any kind ' hatever. (Cheers.) At the same time you made a great remission of indirect taxation; but the whole was submitted to Parliament as a whole, the whole was argued as a whole, the whole was accepted as a whole. (Cheers.) What has been the result ? We have borne, we are still bearing, the burdens which were then freshly imposed; but notone atom of the alleviation has been vouchsafed. (Cheers.) I recollect, Sir, when I had the honour of practising at the Chancery bar it was a maxim of the highest equity that 'ahen an agreement was entered into by two persons, each contracting to do certain particular acts, and when one of the parties had performed the acts which he had contracted to do, and those acts had become irrevocable and unchangeable, it was impossible for the other to recede from his part of the agreement and abandon his obligations. (HIear, hear.) That is the equity upon which I wish this HouAse to proceed. Talk not to moe of "legal" compacts! No, Sir, here is a moral compact which I am confident it concerns the honour of the House to see fulfilled. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman the member for Oxford University has not put his case so strongly as he might have done. He has told you that the provisions contained in the Act of 1853 were of two kinds, both of which contemplated the gradual reduction and final extinction of the tax in 1860. The first facilitated the ultimate abolition of the tax by giving a gradually descending ecale, and the second ensated the extinction of the tax in plain and express terms. What are the words of the act? If hon. gentlemen will have the goodness to refer to the debates in 1816, when this question was so prominently brought before the House, they will find that a great clamour was raised within the walls of Parliament, tbat very few arguments were listened to, that even Mr. Wilberforce could not obtain a hearing, that Lord (then Mr.) Brougham was overpowered by cries for a division, and that the only words to which the least attention was paid were words similar to those which I am now going to read from the Act of 1853. The last clause in that Act runs in these words
"This Act shall commence and talke effect from and after the 6th day of Apiil, 1853, and, together with the daties therein contained, shall continue in force until the 6th of April, 1S60, and no longer."
(Cheers.) These are words which require the completion of your compact. unless you can show an overwhelming necessity, in consequence of which you are forced to reimpose this unequal and odious tax. (Hear.) I am obliged to the Souse for allowing me to go into that part of the5case, for I think this is not merely a pecuniary matter. Thehonour of Parliamentis at stake. (Hear, hear.) If one thing more than another gives weight and stability to our leoislation as compared with other countries it is this-first, that the people repose confidence in that which is done by Parliament; and, secondly, that Parliament itself reposes con. fidence in the acts of its predecessos It is this which makes our legislation certain and not fluctuating, and causes some portion of it to be retained, even against the v shea of the people. We had the other night an illustration of this fact. If there were one reason more than another why the hon. member for North Warwickshire could not, and probably never will, without proposing an equivalent, repeal the Maynooth grant, it is because this country considers, havingembodiedthe grantinanActof Parliament, that there is something like a compact made with the Roman Catholies. But if you keep a compact once entered into, though it be against the wishes of the people, will you not endeavour to keep a compact when the wishes of the people of the united kingdom desire it ? (Hear, hear.) It was, however, said that, let a compact be ever so strone, it may be disturbed by many circumstances over which you have no control; and further, as observed )Fy the noble lord the member for London, that the arrangement made by the Cbancellor of the Exchequer affords the best means of facilitating the observance of the compact and of getting rid of the tax in 1860. I agree that there may be
ability should be aged on all these Statements and all these premises, and bo widely asundorin the conclusions to which tbey have come ? To me the inference is irresistible-that this motion is not well devised for expres3ing on the part of the House of commons one p lin intelligible, practical reult,. (Hear, hear.) W ;hiale are debating here whether we have a deficiency in prospect or whether wo have a surplus, is it not manifest that tbe solttion of that questioi must depend upon the amount of expenditure you contemplate will be incurred in fature years? Apply to future years the expenditure of the present year-namely, estimates for the army and navy of 21,000,000I. and for the civilservice of 7,000,0001., and nodoubt you will find yourself in a deficiency, but apply to the estimaates of fature years those calculations to wh ah the Chancellor of the Exchequer has referred us-I mean the last year in which we enjoyed the blessings of peace-and then you have a safe balancesheet. Does not this bring ns at once to that which is the real point of controversy? Do we mean retrenchment of expenditure, or do we not? Those who mean retrenchment of expenditure have a right to go into Committee of Ways and Means for theremission of taxes. But those gentlemen -I know not who they are, nor whero they sit, though reference has frequently been made to them in the courso of the debate-who do not intend reduction of expenditure are not entitled to go iato Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of remitting taxes. (Hear.) The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Walpole) told us that the irst object he had in view was the remission of the war 9d. Then to-night he may haveanopportunityof accomplishing thatobject by assenting to the motion to go into committee for the purpose of removing thewar 9d. Thatis thefirst practical question with the rit hon. gentleman. It is the first r atical question with Seo noble lord the member for the city of London. I beheve it is the first practical question with all of us and with people out of doors. Therefore, insteadof interposing a motion the meaning of which is not intelligible to us, we should take the practical step on which we are unanimously agreed, and I venture to submit to the House that those who are, a5 r am, sincere advocates of retrenchment would have gained a greatstep. (Hear, hear.) When a resolution shaU have been passedin Committee of Ways and Means, and afterwards adopted by this House, when we have to that extent pledged ourselves to the country, it will be too 'late to adopt a policy inconsistent with our beginning. Having remitted war taxes, we must vigorously deal with war expenditure. (Hear, hear.) Am I without precedent in this argument? My right hon. friend who last addressed the House referred with approbation to the precedent of 116. What was the conduct of this House-what was the conduct of the country gentlemen of England in 1816? As the right hon. gentleman has told us-to demand the immediate abslition of those taxes which had been imposed for the purposes of war. Was the consequence of these remissions of taxation long in following in the reduction of expenditure ? The expenditure which in 1816 was upwards of 60,000,0001. had in one year desended to 43,000,0001.; in another year it wvent down to 25,000 0001.;1 and in snother to 17,000,0001. That was tbe result of a policy which intending to remit taxes did not talk about it, but by a resolution of this House, removing the taxes, rendero a necessary consequence the reduction of expenditure, by wbich aone a nation, like an individual, can be justified ia
parting vwith any portion of its income. We had another example in 1848. The House of Commons was then asked to raise the income-tax from 7d. to ls. in the pound. There was at that time already upon the balance sheet a deficiency oif 2,000,0001. (Hear.) It was not a prospective, it was an actual defimency. (Hear, hear.) Did we concur in that demand? Unanimously we resisted it. Sir Robert Peel, the author of the income-tax, stated in debate that 7d. was its maximum in ordinary times. The House of Commons having refused to increase the income-tax what was the effect upon the estimates? Let any man look at the gradual and not slow descent in their amount. Sir, the question of the balance-sheet in future years turns upon thissimple fact;-if you can bring downr your military estimates to an amount between 17,0,000, . aud 18, 0O0, 001.-I will not trouble the House with minute details, but it is idle to argue abont deficiency or sarplus, unless by a reference to some general amount we know what is the matter of which we are talking-if you can bring down your estimates for the military services to between 17,000,000. and 18,000,0001., you will have a balance in the Exeheqner; if you cannot, you will be in a deficiency. Now, Sir, have we afalr prospect of acomplishing that object? I have examined what has been. the expenditure for the military services during the whole time that I have been in public life. There have been five Prime Ministers, who have had to submit estimates to four different Parliaments. The Ministries of Lord Melbourne and of Lord John Russell, in the last years of their existence, submitted estimates amounting to 14,500,0001. Sir Robert Peel, when our relations with France were critical, and when the uregon question was the subject of the utmost anxiety, incurred an expenditure not equal to 17,000,0001. The esthmates of Lord Derby, adopted r believe from his predecessor, but still adopted, amounted to 16,000,0001. The expenditure of Lord Aberdeen, in the last year of the peace, swelled already by the anticipation of the coming war (hear, hear), barely exceeded 16,000,OOOl. Is it, then, hopeless that, in years of profound peace, we can reduce our military expenditure to a sum between 17,000,00.0. and 18,000,0001. 7 (Hear, hear.) Lot those who think it is-let those who have a faint heart for the work of judicious retrenchment and reduction vote for increased taxes; but for us who are determined to enforce that economy which is consistent with efficiency I submit that the nataral course is that we should not vote for a dilatory amnendment, but should at onco go into Comi mittee of Ways and Means, for the purpDse of accomplishing the first object of my right hon. fliend (Mr. Walpole) by remitting that portion of the income-tax which is -enerally regarded as having been added to meet the expenAiture of the var. (Cheers.) Then, Sir, what should be our second object ? 1 listene with the utmost attention to every syllable which fell from the noble lord (Lord J. Russell) upon the interesting question of those articles of great consumption from which we have recently removed taxes with such infinite advantage to the trade and industry of the country (hear, hear), and with so much benefit to the Exchequer. (Hear, hear.) In the plans of my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer aro included certain additions to the taxes upon tea and sugar. Are these increases necessary? (Hear, hear.) If they are, that will no doubt be a great argunment with the House in favour of their acceptance. But slt me ask this question,a question which was pertinently put by the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mtr. Disraeli), in bringing forward this amendment, and which has been strongly repeated to-night by the noble lord the member for the city of London-Are you justified in assuming that you can in the year 188-59 return to a certain moderate scale of expenditure, and are you justified in making no attempt at meeting the same requirement in the year whose balance-sheet you are now considering, and whose expenditure you can now control? If you will reduce the latter half of this year only to what you yourselves say is to be the expenditure of the first half of the coming year-that is to say, if you will only anticipato by six months that very economy to which you have invited us to look, yoa may safely abstain from any retractive effeot upon those articles of general consumption which contribate so large a part of the trade of this country, and which contribute so much.i to the happiness and welfare of the people. (Hear, hear.) When we get into Committee of Ways and Means and are invited to consider the question of increasing in a time of peace the duties which the poorer classes of the community are required to pay upon tea and coffee, it will behove the Hlouse before adopting that course to know that there is some reason why we cannot accomplish in the latter half of 1857 the same economy to which we are invited to look forward in the first half of 1858. (Rear, hear.) I have taken my
ight hon. friend (hlr. Walpole) step by step. His first poit wasthat we should remove those taxes which were imposed for the purposes of the war. His second point was that we should vigilantly examine and considerably reduce unnecessary expenditure. His third point was that we should maintain inviolate that compact which he tells us was made in 1853 between us and the people of this country. Sir, I sincerely hope that the promises of that magnificent budget of 1853 may, notwithstanding the misfortune which has happened to us in the interval, finally be realized and fulfilled. But when we talk so highly as my hon. friend talked of a compact, when we speak of arrangements that are to be made three years hence, we oight to remember humbly that Circumstances three years hence are not so completely within our control. (Cheers.) This I will say to my right hon. friend, if we are to keep that compact the best thing we can do in the interval is to replenish the Exchequer. (Hear, bear.) If, under the shelter of the large sum which in that year falls in from the national debt-a sum exceeding 2,000,0001-we are to give the people the benefit of the entire abolition of the income-tax, it is necessary that we should take care effectually to replenish the Exchequer during the interval. Then, by the retrenchment of expenditure and by omitting to impose upon great articles of consumption those taxes the imposition of which checks trade, fetters industry, and diminishes consumption, you may reasonably hope that in the year 1860 you will have a buoyant revenue and aflourishing people. This will heaccomu plished by providing in each year for the burdens which be-
aongtot, adnot, as I understood mvright hon. friend, availing ourselves of the hrat mo diminished expenditure to operate UpOl other taxes, the remission of which would contribute less to the welfaro and prosperity of the people. 2y right hon. friend the UShancelior of the
Exchequer ru the speech in which he introduced this debate quoted to us divers authorities. If I might take the liberty of pointing out to a sc!:olar like my right hon. friend an authority which was worthy of his notice, I would re-
commend to his attention an epigrammatic maxim of Sagy who wrote:-" The best of all plans of finance is to spend little; anid the best of all taxes is the smallest." (Cheers, and laughter.) I would venture to recommend to him also the exainple of our ally, who immediately upon the transition from war to peace, has proclaimed to ins Chambers that the existing state of his people requires a vigilant
supervision and careful retrenchment of his expenditure, the reduction of the military establishments, and the postponement of works of less pressing necessity. We ourselves learned from the late war that it was not by military establishments only that a nation is made powerful. Russia had large establishments (hear, hear); France had large esta-
blishments; we had comparatively small ones; and yet when the crisis of that war arrived Ptussia was impoverished; France was suffering from pecuniary premsure ; England, rising with the occasion, was ready to encounter the increased severities of continued hostilities. (Cheers.) What moral lesson do we learn from this ? To what do we owe that gratifying circumstance 9 W e owe it to the wisdom which had filled the Exchequer without distreEsing the nation, which had established trade upon a frm fonndation, which had made our people prosperousin their industry, and by a wise economy have avoided entailing upon them unneCessary burdens. (Hear, hesr.) Believing then, Sir, that by judicious economy we can accomtlish the objects which my righthon. friend (Mr. Walpole) had in view, I object to this amendment, because it keeps
us from that practical stage of our proceedings where we can realize the first of these objects, and lay the founda.
tion for the succeeding ones. 1 think that the adoption of that 1mendment would beadoubtful, would be an impracti. cable course, and, therefore, I shall vote that you, Sir, leave the cbhir, and that we go into committee for the purpose of removing those taxes, from which, as they were imposed in
a time of war, the people now, on the return of the blessings
of peace, justly and properly demand to be relleveL. (Cheers.)
Mr. X. GIBSON gaid that, like the right hon. gentleman who Lad just sat down, he had listened with attention to the specohes which had been delivered since the commencement of this debate, and they had brought to his mind a strong conviCtion Of the importance of the issue on which the House had to decide. (Eear, hear.) He obeleved also that they had enabled him to form.s, correct estimate of the meaning aunvalue of the vote which he should be called sipon to give. The noble lord thememberfor the cityof London had made a speech in which, so far s the general sentiments were concerned, he (Ur. Gibson) entirely concurred, as that speech must be taken in the light of a friendly communication to Her Majesty's Government to induce them to alter their policy, but tho noble lord concluded by advising the gouss to vote for their policy. What, ein fact, was the question wbich they wero now called upon to decide? The Chancellor of the Exchequer had made his finarncial statement, and had invited the House to go into Committee of Ways and Means-to impose Td. in the pound upon income for the next three years, and to increase the daties upon tea and sugar, in order to provide funds to defray the expenditure necessary for the public service of the current year. The right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Disraeli) objeoted to follow that course, and had submitted a resolution to the House which hon. members could read upon the paper; but before they could discuss tho merits of the right hon. gentleman's resolution they must first give an opinion aye or no. Were they favourable upon the whole to the financial scheme propounded by the Government! (Hear, hear.) If the House should decide that they were not favourable to that scheme, they would then be called upon togivetheirapproval of the sabstitute proposed by the right hon. mnember for Bucks. He (Mir. Gibson) would briefly state his own view of the matter. He conceived that those gentlemen who were wliUing to add 4,000,0001. to the estimates for the army and navy In excess of the estimates of the year preceding the war-who were in favour of an increase in the duties upon tea and sugar, and for levying 7d. in the pound upon incomes for the next three years-must votefor going into committee. (Hear.) Those who, on the contrary, thought the estimates were too high, who considered that the duties upon tea and sugar ought not to be increasd, that a tax of 7d. should not be placed upon incomes-those members would vote against going intoQcmmittee. (Hear.) By adopting that course they would be taking the obvious Parliamentary course of expressing their opinion of the financial scheme of the Government as a whole. The noble lord the member for the city of London and the right hon. baronet the member for Portsmouth (Sir F. Baring) said, " Do not oppose the Committee of Ways and Means, allow the Government to proceed, and take your chance in a Committee of Supply of opposing the particular duties upon tea and sugar, to which you object." He (fr. Gibson) doubted whether that was good advice for hon. members who were desirous of a prctical result. (Hear, hear.) No doubt the hon. member for Lambeth (Ur. Williams) would be gratified by finding among his small minorities the names of the noble lord and the right hon. member for Portsmouth, and, perhaps, with great exertions, he might succeed in reducing the salary of a chaplain in the Bahamas or of knocking off the odd 8hilling upon some other particular vote. (' Hear, bear," and laughter.) But if the House was in earnest if it wauted to obtain a practical result, it must take itsistand at once. (Hear, hear.) During his experience in Parliament he had never known a successf ol effort made to bring about a reduction of expenditure in any other way than by leaving to the Government the respousibility of proposing the reductions by informing them generaly that the scale of expenditure and taxation which they proposed did not meet the approval of Parliament. Then came the question, was he so opposed to the plan of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he was justified in recording his vote against it? That plan must be taken in connexion with the explanatory speech which introduced it. The speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer must be taken as an indication of the fiscal and general financial policy of the Government. Regarding it in that light, be frankly owned that, as a whole, he conscientiously believed that speech had a retrograde and reactionary complexion about it. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchemner had told them of the prosperity of the country-of the increased exports and imports, with a view, no doubt, to inspire them with a confidence that the burdens he was about to propose could be borne without much pressure upon the country. Bat, altbough the right hon. gentleman had told them about the foreign trade, he had not said one word about the condition of the home trade. He spoke of the prosperous classes, but did not say anything of she condition at that moment of the great body of the labouring classes of the country. That was a most remarkablo omission, because in his financial scheme it was from the labouring classes the right hon, gentleman proposed to draw a considorable portion of his increased revenue. (Hear, hear.) He proposed to add to the duties upon tea and sugar, articles of consumption next to the very necessaries of life (hear, hear), but he did not say whether the labouring classes were now in a condition to bear the increased burden. Although, no doubt, the resources of the country were vast, and although, no doubt, we could bear 76,000,OOOl. of taxation during the last war with less suffering than any other country would have felt had it been called upon to support so great a burden, still he was informed and beheved that at the present moment the great body of agricultural labourers and mechanics in this country had little means left, after procuring the bare necessaries of life, to excend in articles bearing Customs duties. He was informed that an zgricultaral labourer in Suffolk, with a wife and five children, was not able with his present wa"es to purchase siore thau one ounce of tea per week. 'Were they gomg to add to the price of that ounce of tea? (Hear, hear.)
fe took the cae of a skilled mechanic earning 11. a-weel, expending his income as men of that class usuaUy did, he found that the taxes paid in the shape of indirect duties upon articles of consumption amounted to no lesS than 3s., if not 4s., ou' of that ll., so that if an in.- come-tax were to be levied instead of indirect duties such a man would have to pay 3s. or 4s. in the pound. Surely that was not a class upon which fresh burdens should be imposed. The right hon. gentleman the C}ancellor of the Exchequer omitted in his speech all reference to that class, but at the same time introduced matters totaUy irrelevant to the question-the paper duty, the tax upon insurances, and the duties upon wine. As, however, the right hon. gentleman had volunteered statements respecting the paper duty, he (Mr. Gibson) would make one or two observations in reply. The right hon. gentleman appeared to take a mere exciseman's view of that question. He had told the House that the repeal of the duty upon paper (thinkimg no doubt of ;three volume novels or MI'CuUoct's Dictionary) would not have an appreciable effect upon high priced books. Dull people made the saie remark about the repeal of the glass duties, that it would not have an appreciable effect upon the price of their decanters and wine glasses. But that was not the view taken of the matter by those who advocated a repeal of the Excise duty on paper. They believed that the duty impeded the expansion of an important manufacture, restricted employment, and therefore produced an increase of pauperism and crime. The right hon. gentleman might sneer at the ideaof the paper dutybeingatax upon knowledge, but he(alr. Gibson) thought that a duty which amounted to 30 per cent. upon the cost of ordinary school-books and copy-books used by the humbler classes was a tax; upon kLowledge, and was inconsistens with the efforts now being made by Parliament to promote the spread of education throughout the country. Hle now came to the question of the right hon. gentleman's resolution. He wished to disentangle himself from the merits of that resolution. (Laughter.) He went some way
rith the right hon. gentleman, thinking that to sauction the proposed expenditure for the present year would be to lay the foundation for a deficency in future years; and that it was absolutely certain that next year an appeal would be made to Parliament for increased taxation. We were now, after a great war, settling what should be our peace expenditure; and he must do the Government the justice to say thatthey had not for a moment held c-t the hope of any material reduction of that expenditure. The very items they had adduced as constituting the cause of,the existin,g increase were such as clearly showed that they did not contemplate the probability of any large reduction. lt had alwfays been the practice after every wvar to make a permanent addition to the naval and military expenditure of the country; and it only accorded w/ith what had been seecn in modern times to find the attempt now made by keeping up large establishments, to perpetuate a portion of the werr espenditure. Budgets, no doubt, ought to be made only for one year; and to bring forwvard specific plans of income and expenditure for three or four years in advance was wholly futile. Indeed, the compacts dwvelt upon by thenrght hon. gentlemana opposite (MIr. Walpole) were equally futile. They could not boind the discretion of future Parliaments;t and even now, if they were to make the most solemn promises relative to tho income or any other tax, they had so entirely lost their character by breakine previous pledges of that kInmd that the public wrould put no faith in them. Their duty was to decdec, first, what the exigencies of the country were, and then raise the supplicate mneet them in the wray w.hich they believed at the time to be least injurious to the interests of the country. But, without making budgets for future years, it was impossible, in settling their scale of expenditure, not to leek forward a little. If they agreed to the present scale of expenditure, their sanction of it wvould be nuoted against them hereafter; and thesamcearguments regardingthed.ijfiiulty Gf makingreductions would be reproduced. N~o one hadyvet
answered the query put by the hon. member for Wick ( Laing-viz., 'IfhyoucanmalkethesereductionsinlS58@9, why ca't yo make them now' In 1816 the great.Whig party did not wait for two or three years before they enforced the principle of reduction on tho Government. The' present rrime Minister, who was Secretary at War in IS16, was urged by the noble lordthe memberforLondon, by Lord Brouham, the Marquis of LInsdowne, Sir J. Mlackintosh, and a the Whig leaders of that day, to lower the expenditure and revert to peace establishments in the very first year after the French war. The excuse that this could not be'done at once was given then as now, but it was not ace ted as sufficient, neither did he for one now accept it. The expenditure found adequate for the security of the country revious to the Russian war would be equally adequate now. he right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Disraeli) had clearly made out his case with respect to a deficiency, for if the scale of expenditure now proposed was to be adhered to in future years inereased taxes would be demanded in 1858-9. That being so, the advocates of a free commercial system vould see that, with the feeling of hostility displayed towards the income-tax, an attempt would be made to levy further duties on articles of consumption. They would thus have a gradual reversal of the great policy inaugurated in 1842. ("Oh, oh t"1) Suchx must be the effect of sanctioning the proposed scale of expendituro for future lears. A few words on the latter part of the right hon, gentleman's resolution to show that he should vote, inot in reference to ita nmerits (laughter), bat in reference to the preceding question before the louse. The right hon. gentleman opposite said that the House should place it in the power of k'arliament by arangements to boe now made to remit the income-ta, if it thought fit,, in 1oo0. His3 (gr. Gibson's) decided convicticn wvas that they would not be able to temit that
this is not immediately to the purpose, neither s thsdisinterrng theopinion of Arthur Young on direct and i idirect taxation very pertinent to this discussion. I1greatly agree with the observation of the right hon. gentleman the member for, Backinghamshiro, who sWid that we need not employ ouraslves in disquisitions upon direct and indirect taxation, because, unhappily, both to a great extent must still be imposed upon and paid by the people of this country. But my right hon. friend (or. Gladstone) madeatnother eharge, not, sas have said, consistent with the former part of hiseccasation. e ensayse the chan o3Excheqwer isreally endeavouring to defeat what I will not eall a compact, bat the anderstanding come to in 1853, that in 1860 we should see the end of the income-tax. Sir, I hold it to be x great point of pubUu c policy to adhere to the expectation pe encouraged the country to cherish in 1853 (S r, hear.) I reco31et hov many gentlomen there were who thought it would be possible to make a distinction between ermanent and precarious incomes. I recollect how many more objected to the succession dnty as an additionto the income-ta, and I think, unless sonmc overpoowering necesity should require it, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1860 would not be justi60ed in interfering vith the oporation of the Act of Parliament wh ch ordains that &thi tac shall eease at the end of that year Thatiit is the most powerful financial weapon vhich wo can ikossess for time of wvar the experience of the last war nas shown as ntrongly xs thatyof the French war You collect by means of it xa immense revenue. True, it is a sort of confiscationt because you take from each man a p.ortiOn of that wrhich he posseeses at the moment, withoat inquirintg from what source he derives it, or howv long he is likely to continue to enjoy it. You take it as a means of maintaining the n.ational secunity, and in time of war you
uejustified m dog so; but when peace returns, I must say that it would be right either to abandon the tax, after taking advantage of it for a certain limited time, or eLse to attempt its reconstruction, which I do not beiieve any financial abilities would enable a Chancellor of the Exchequer to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) I am, therefore, most deiiroa3 that the tax should come to an endm 1860. slear.) I cannot see, I confess, that the Chancellor of the Excheqner has interposed any obstacle in the way of that consumunation. (Hear, hear.) Not only has he not done so, butI should say that his proposed adition to the income-tax of 2d. in the poundin the present and the two succeeding years, and his proposal that some further sums beyond those imposed by the Act of Parliament should be levied on the articles of teana sugar, instead of being opposed to the budget of 1853, are spoecily intended to carry it into effect. (Cheers.) We hlave not had many figures laid before us, and I am sorry for it, because, after the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made his statement, it is the most conyenient course to lay the figures before us, as has been done on aome former occasions; but from returns which have been laid before us, showing the liabilities which we have incurred on acount of the war, I find that during the years 1857-8-9 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aecording to the angement of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, will have to pay off no less than 6,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds. The course which my right hon. friend took in making this arrangement was by no means unusual, and was quite justifiable under the circumstances, and the Chan.c01or of the Exchequer is following it up, because when we went into committee of supply the other night we agreed annimously to a vote of 2,000,00
for the payment of Exchequer-bonds to that amount, which fall due in th resent year. We have in these three years to provide 9~, 2u0,0001. for the payment of the prinacipal, of ihe debt which has been incurred in this war, and with the charge in each year for additional funded and unfaunded debt we have altogether to pay in these three ye-ars no less a sum than 13,2020OOL. If we are to do thise-and, I think, certainly we ongt todoit-what meanscould theChancellor of the Exchequer resort to except to keeping up the taxation somewhat higher than the Act of Parliament provides ? He will then obtain the means of doing that which has never yet been done, and which my right hon, friend the member for the Universityof Oxford moregparticularly inidsts upon; he wll be paying off a considerable portion of the
eincured on account of the war within a s!khort tinme altr its termination. I maintain, therefore, that the policy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, far from being in opposition to the plan of my right hon, friend the member for the University of Oxford, is in direct conformity with it. A heavy part of the charge made against the Chancellor o' the Exchequer was that he showed an indifference upon this subject-that he was taxing those great articles of consumption of the poorer classes without necessity. t totally deny that (hear, hear) ; there was nothing said by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which at all tended to show such an inclination on his part. (Hear, hear.) It was said, besides, that the Chancellor of the Exche-
ncer had resally misestated the whole case, and that what he did retain he seemed to retain as a right which belonged to the Treasury, while the taxes which he remitted herepresented as being the free gift-amounting to about ll,000,0001.-of the Government to the people. It is obvious that the only fair manner in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer can proceed is to lay before the Committees of Ways and Means andSupply the state of the country, to show what wil be the operation of the Acts of Parliament bearing on the finances, and to propose to us the scheme which he thinks best. It is not forhim to say, " I grant a remison of taxation amounting to U,000,0001." liat was there anything of that kind of boasting in my right hon. friend's statement the other night? You. may make objections to that statement, uoa may say that it leads to a deficiency, yoU may dissent from its policy, but I defy any man to say that it contained anything ike boasting or undue assumption. (Hear, hear.) I come next to those duties which the Chancellor of the Exchequer DroDOSeS to keep up in regard to tea and sugar, and I must By; I think, he proposes to keep these duties up to much toolarge an amount. I find by the representations whichhave been made to me b persons largely interested in the tea trade, whose petition I presented the other night, that the right hon. gentleman, accordin, to his own proposition, would obtain more than 1,000,0001 in the present year of duty on that article beyond that which the Act of Parliament gives him. I have been furnished with the exact figures, and I find that if the proposed increase in the tea duty take place the Chanceullor of the Exchequer will obtain in the first year 5,660,0001., while the Act of Parliament would only give him 4,000,0001.; in 1S58-9 he would obtain 4,500,0001., while the Act of Parliament would only give him 3,200,0001.; and, in the whole three years, instead of 10,400,0001., which the Act of Parliament gives him, he would take 13,616,0001., being an increase in the tea duty of nol ess than 3,216,0001. in the three years. (Hear, hear.) Without objecting to the principle, which I think is a fair one, that the expenses of the war and of the increased establishrniots rendered necessary by the [war should be defrayed, so far as regards these
three years, not entirely by persons having incomes of more than 1G01., but partly by articles of general consumption, consumed as weU by persons of lower incomes than 1001. as by persons of income beyond that sum, it is obvious that, assuming this principle to be a fair one, it is too much to press unon an article of consumption so generally used as tea. I should be glad, therefore, if, either by adopting the plan of those persons engaged in that tradethat ls. 4d. should be the duty for each of the three years, or by some similar scale? my right hon. friend would consent somewhat to mitigate the pressure of hisproposaL (Cheers.) 'Upon this subject a statement has gone forth, apparentlywith thesanction ofthe Chancellorofthe Exchequer and the Secretary for the Treasury, which is altogether erroneous. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was supposed to have stated that the stock of sugar was exceedingly low, and that the same was the fact as regarded tea.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I did not say that the stock of tea was low. What I said was that owing to the late events at Canton the supply must be expected to fall short.
Lord J. RUSSELL-There was an ambiguity in the expresson which has led to the mistake - but, however, I don't believe that the difficulties at Canton need last long, an,dthis is certain, that there is an immense stock of tea just at present, amounting to about 87,000,0001b., of which about 10,000,0001b. wll pay duty, probably in the first month after the 5th of April next. Such being the case, the assumption that the consumer would not derive any great beneft from a reduction of duty is not true with re-
ad tea. I believe that consumers woeldeain a great nefriot from such a reduction as is contemplaten by the Act of Parliament. I do not believe that the reduction of 2d.-from 1s. 9d. to ls. 7d. proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer could be much of a benefit to the consumer; the retail dealer, pro. babl would get the whole of it, and though I do not go the whole length of my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford in desiring that the Act of Parliament should take its course exactly as it is, I do hope that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer comes to this part of his budget he will endeavour to make it more palatable and more beneficial. (Hear, hear.) I do not think my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford vas at all justified in his allegation that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was treating us like children. That part of my right hon. friend's speech made me think that he was somewhat like an anxious mother who, having a favourite child in the cradle, has a vision in the night that it is falling over a precipice, and wakes screaming with fright. There was really so much passion in my right hon. friend's speech, that it could have been prompted by nothing else but a paternal feeling of apprehension for his own budget. ("lIear, hear," and laughter.) But, Sir, as that mother, rising from her bed and finding her child in the cradle safe and well, would go back to her rest reassured, so I trust that, after the division on tthis subject, even if it should be
in opposition to his views, my right hon, friend will awake from his delusion, and will find that his child is safe and has been in no danger. (Hear, hear.) Having dealt with the allegations of my right hon. friend, I now come to a very serous part of this question, upon which I do not think we can decide accordig to the proposition of the right hon, gentleman opposite, by our voto to-night, but with regard to which I confess I feel considerable apprehension and look to the future with much anxiety. I refer, not to the Committee of Ways and Means, but to the Committee of Supply, and the votes to be taken in that committee. (EHear, hear.) I think that we canuot now ask the ChancelUor of the Exchequer to produce an estimate of the expenditure for 1 and 1859. It would be most unreasonable to make such a demand (hear, hear) but at the same time a question was asked by the right hon. member for Buckinghamshiro which I think as jusfiedbythe statement of the Chancelor of the Exchequer. That right hon. gentleman (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), in in troducing the budget, told us what he propoeed, and what vourld be the consequence of adopting those propositions with regard to the present year. We were to have about 65,000,0001. of expenditure and 66,000,0001. of revenue leaving a surplus of about 900,0001. Bet when my right hon, friend came down on a subsequent day he told us, "Your incomewil be Tery mauch less in future years It wil be 62,3000001 next year, and 62,26,01 ntese ceeding year. I won't give any estimate of expenditure for thoseyears, butif you wll make a comparison with the estimates and expenditure of 1853, I think yon will see that we can provide for the public services after the rate of 1853, and we shall then have a probable margin of i,000,0oo1."
"But," says the right hon.xmember for Buckinghamshire, :if the establishments of 1853 wera sufficient to provide for the honour and ecurity of the country, how is it that we are not to imitate them til 1858 ? Why should we be
careless-perhaps lavish-irr 1857,-and say Ilatin 1858wo" mean to be so wise, so frgl,h and-so ocotioWclm to balanco our income and expenditurea?,I willaot ievert to the esimates for 1853, but I cannot help- mentioning my own extravagant estimates for 1848, -whichi wiere re,erred to by the right hon, member for Buoki ghamubsire. Those estimates were rery loudly objected toin this House, and several hon. -gentlemensome of them high in office-complained of their extravk. gance. I at that time proposed an estimat4 of 7 726 61O0
for the navy, 7,162,9961. for the army, and2.92.,00,E for the ordnance, making a total of 17,814,4111. I also pro.,
osed 150,0O04 for the militia, making altogether 17,964,441L Taking the whole estimates, including the. debt, the military and naval estimates, and the civil contingencies, the total amount was 53,496,5411. If I add to that amount the expenditure for the collection ef the revenue and superaunuations, which did not then come into the financial estimates of the year, and wh ch would be about 4,710,0001., the totalexpenditurewouldbe o8,20,5411. I find, nowever, that those extravagant estimates, which I was obliged to abandon, in consequence of the general feeling of the House, were 5 018,0001 below the estimates of the present year. (Hear, hear.) I don!tblame the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I know what trouble every Chancellor of the Exchequer must have in enforcing economy upon other departments. (" Hear, hear," from Sir F.Baring.) My right hon friend near me most naturally cheers that observation (a laugh), but I cannot help thinking that when we come to consider the estimates in Committee of Supply, it will be our duty to look most carefully and
antly into the charges for the public establishments. Mearn) The Ministers of the various departments may have better reasons to assign for those estimates than those which have been given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We may find, on going into detail, that there are good grounds for some estimates whieh at present seem unjusti. sable. I trust, however, that this is a period o. peace. (Hear, hear.) I trust that we shall speedily conclude a eace with Perala, and that the foolish hostilities in China wl not be continued. (Hear, hear.) If that oe the case-seeing that we have an alliance with France, which when I pro. duced my estimates in 1848 was a matter of considerable difficulty and uncertainty-seeing that we have made peace wth that great Power which was lately our enemy, and that we have accomplished all the objects of the war, I think we are entitled to ask for peace estimates (cheers), and that those estimates should form the foundation of oar expenditure in future 7ears. (Hear hear.) Ever since it 'was known that conditions of peace were under discussion at the Paris Conferences it has been admitted on all sides that a considerable time-at least a year-was not too long a time to allow the Government for the reduction of the war establishments. As, however, the war is over, I do not see why arrangements which will be good in 1853 and 1859 should not be adapted to 1857, and why wo should not now come to a resolution as to what our peace estimates shall be. (Hear, hear.) I shall listen with great attention to the statements that may be madeby the Ministers of the Crown with regard to the estimates they propose. I believe, as those estimates now stand, there is no doubt that if they were to be folowed for the next two years the calculation of the right hon. member for Buckinghamshire would prove substantialy correct and that we shlould have a deficiency of nearly 5,000,0001. in those years. (Hear.) I do notthink itis
reasonable thing to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the estimates for the next two years, and I don't think the right hon. gentleman is bound to give them. If, indeed, that right hon. gentleman had been disposed to pursae an ambiguous and somewhat dishonest course upon this queston, he might have said, " I mean to effect a reduction of 2,000,0001. in the army, of 2,000,0001. in the navy, and of 1000 0001 in the civil service estimates. That will give you tne halanos-sheet for 1858." (EHear, hear.) Everybody would know that such an estimate was not worth the panps on which it was written. (Cheers.) There can be no doubt that, in ignorance of what may be the circumstances of the years 1858 and 1859,-in ignorance of what may be oar foreign relations or our domestic exigencies,-it is impos. sible for any Minister of Finance to make anything like an exact prospective estimate. I oonceive, however, that before we go into a consideration of the estimates it is our duty to require from the Ministers of the Crown a statement of the position of the country with regard both to foreign and omestic affairs. Parliament has a right to know in what relation the country is placed with respect to those Powers with whom we are now engaged in hostilities before it consents to vote away the money of the people, and to assent to increased estimates. I cannot accept altogether the explanation given by the ChanceUor of the Exchequer with regard to those local burdens which have been placed upon the estimates during late years, because by far the larger portion of that amount was placed upon the estimates previously to 1853. I mustsay, however, that I shall be ready in Committee of Ways and Means to allow that, keeping in view the policy of justice and good faith, and looking forward to the cessation of the incometax in 1860, I should not require any large concessions with respect to duties of customs, excise, or other taxes, in the year 1857. (Hear, hear.) But I do not therefore give up the prospects of the future. When, in the course of the last century, some eminent scientific men were sent from Paris on an exploring expedition to Lapland, they reached an inhospitahle sea, where they erected a stone with the inscription-"Sistimus hic tandem nobis ubi defuit orbis." That is not and cannot be our osition. I trust that the extension of commerce and of right principlesof finance will make continual progress. I trust that although the ChanceUor of the Exchequer may be forced to confine his wishes for the moment to his present budget, yet that the country will see that a policy which nas already been productive of such glorious fruits may in future years produce still more gloriousresults. Irejolco to hear from him-and I think that hon. gentlemen, to whatever party they belong. must all rejoice to bear-such prosperous accounts of our trade, such prosperous accounts especiaUy of British shipping at the present time. I trust that further measures of the saeie wise and liberal kindmeasures founded on noselfish advantage, upon no restrictive polcy, uponnoenvions jealousy of foreign nations, but upon apo.scywich, beginninginwisdom foryourselves endswith liberality, justice, and bounty to all manldnd-Itrust that that policy which my right hon. friend said was inaLuurated 15 years ago-I care not about the date, althoughIshould have put it further back, and think we ought not to forget the iuustrious names of Huskisson aud Poulett Thomson (cheers)-I trust that that policy, thus inaugurated, has still greater triumphs to achieve, and will induce the nations of the world to follow our example, and thus unite is aU in bonds of peace, commerce, and amity. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. BENTINCK said, it struck him there were some singular omissions in the speech of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone). That right hon. gentleman had been a party to the war, but when thus embarked in it he and his colleagues had so starved the war as to render necessary an expenditure of millions where thousands would otherwise have sufficed. (Hear.) They were thus the chief causes of the financial difficulty that the House had now to deal with. (Hear.) There were two objects which the House hadl in view-the repeal or reduction of the income-tax-the most onerous, most unpopular, and most mischievous of taxes; and secondly, to vote the estimates with the utmost economy consistent with the honour and interests of the country. Having these two principles in view, he could neither support the resolution of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer nor the resolution of his right hon. friend (Mr. Disraeli). As to the right hon. gentioman opposite (Mr. Gladstone) he was entirely consistent, for he suggested a thousand difficulties withoutn sggesting a single remedy. (Hear, hear.) The House were as ed to vote the money of the people before they -were told to 'what objects it was to be devoted, and what sum was required by the necessities of the country. (Hear, hear.) It appeared to him that the course now pursued was not only at variance with custom but with reason. (Hear.) There had been until now no departure for centuries from the practice of deciding upon the estimates to be voted before they went into Committee of Ways and Means. (" iHear," from tho Opposition benches.) The noble lord (J. Russel) had talked of a reduction ot 5,000,000. in the estimates, but how could the House decide n pon the amount t be extracted from the nocke's of the people if they did not know within 5,000,00Wg 'what the estimates ouqht to be? (Hear, hear.) If they began first by consldermag the estimates they would be enabled to cut them down at their pleasure. He would support any economy that was consistent with the honour an minterests of the country, but he would not lend himself to an unreasoning desire to cut down the estimates and en. danger the honour and safety of the country. (Hlear, hear.) The only mode of escape for the House was to revert to the usual course of proceeding. He should therefore move that the debate be now adjourned, with the ulterior object of moving at the proper period that the debate be adjourned until the House had agreed to the report of the Committeo of Supply on the Army, Navy, and Ordnance Estimates. (Cheersm)
Mr. MILNEBShoped the hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Bentinek) would not consider that he was guilty of any disrespect towards him if he addressed himself to the general question beforo the House ratber than to the motion which he had just made. He must say that during the long and able speech of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, the other evening, there was one very predominant feeling in the House-viz., a strong desire that he should favour them with the alternative which he thought they should adopt in the event of their rejecting the proposition of the Chancelor of the Exchequer. (Hear.) He knew from historical experience in that House, that'he might have said he ought not to be asked to adviee til he was regularly and legitimately called on for that purpose, but that excuAe was taken from him by the fact that the difficalties of the Chancellor of the
Exchquer onward to 186w0 wvere difficulties imposed on him
by the right hon. gentleman himself in his budget of 1853. (Hear.) Those difficulties showed the impropriety of prospective budgets, and taught us that, in doing his best for the country, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should confine himself very much to the time immediately before him. But, even supposing prospective budgets were in themselves desirable, there had occurred since 1833 sO many disturbing events, our expectations had been so comnpletely baffled by the mysterious desipus of Providence, and we had le .rnt such a lesson of humility, that the Chan-
cellnrof the Exchequerwould have beenjustifled in saylughe could not regard any part of the arrangement of 1858 as fnal; and he was sure that even the rtght hon. gentleman (Mr Gladstone) himself, had he inl863 foreseen the oircumstance
that had sine occurred, would at once have said that he only meant his arrangement to be carried out in accordance with the ordinary current of events. (Hear, hear.) He would not enterinto any analysis of ourfinancialsystem, but
would take the liberty to remark that he saw with regret the change of opinion that had been manifested both in
the House and the country with regard to the question of direct taxation. (Hear, hear.) There was a tinie when the cry of direct taxation was the Shibboleth of the Liberal party inthis country, and when tho advocacy of that question was regarded as a proof that a mnan belonged to a school of advanced politics. (Hear.) He regretted, however, to find that a change had taken place in some quarters, and certainly he di not think that that change had been made either wis-ely or advisedly. (ear.) e had not beenwithout hisfearsthat the extravagant expenditure 'which characterized the Government during the war would have been continued by them in time of peace, but he had now reason to believe that the present feling of the Government rather was to carry out reductions with vigour and energy. Indeed, he
~WInafra1d there was a tendency to abandon some of thoso
mprov6mentiwhich lihd originated during the war.

(Hear.)

Sir J. TYRELL said that since 1830, when he firsb entered Parliament, le had never till now seen such a strange state of thingsas regarded the Parliamentarysections of that House. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) At thin moment he considered that a most extraordinary spectacle was presented to the country by right hon. gentlemen sitting on so many different benches. (Renewod laughter.) The noble lord the member for London sat perched up behind the noble leader of the House, and when he saFthoso right hon. gentlemen, with great and powerful talents '*nd efficient habits of business, sitting below the gangway tafluding to the place where Sir J. Graham and lfr. Gladstone usually sit), and observed also the hon. member for Buckingbam. shire with his brilliant talents and the other right hon. gentlemen endowed with perseverance and determination by his side he could not help coming to the conclusion that all those right hon. gentlemen were ready to pounce down on the noble lord tho leader of the Hlouse the first moment when they thought he had made a mistake. (Laughter.) What were the circumstances which inducod this extraordinary change in the position and oratory of hon. members l In the furst place, the right hon. member for Offord University entered the House this session in a most gladiatorial spirit, displayed an inclination by his eloquence and oratory to make the worse appear the better cause, and panted to come into conflict with the ChanceUor of the Exchequer. (Hear, hear.) Now, he was one of those who thought a gigantic fraud, in a Parliamentary sense
lahter), had p ep n attempted upon lon. gentlemen on that tthe Opposition) side of the House. (Hear, hear.) He had read with surprise, disagreeing with almost every word of it, the Conservative aricle in the Querterly RZview, headed "The Prospects of the Country." Now, he did not declare with any confidence that the right hon. member for Oxford 'University ws the author of that article, but there were strong marks indicating that he had some hand in it; and he saw such a strong Amilarity of sentiment between the right hon. member for Oxford University, the Peace Society, and the right hon. gentlemen sitting on the Opposition side that he, as a Conservative, felt considerable alarm. ("Hear," and laughter.) The noble lord at the head of the Government was ccused by many gentlemen of being fond of war; but when the noble lord went down to Manchester the Peace Society disappeared and took no part in the glorification of that noble lord, 'ho had well deserved the gtitude of his country. (,ear, heard) That noble lord took the reins of the State when they were deserted by others, and he trusted before the nip-cheese estimates of the right hon. member for Oxford University should be proposed the House would have the advautage of hearing the gallnt defender of e, who when he first landed in England uttered sentiments to which every Englishman responded. (Htear, bear.) The hon. baronet here quoted the following passge from a speech delivered by the late Mr. Brotherton, in the presenceoof Lord Palmerston -
"I am well aware that there have been various attacks upon your lordship with regard to your foreign policy, and I have heard people insinuate that you had a sort of desiro to bring the country into conflict with other nations, and, in a word, that you were no friend of peace. But let me remind persons who would make such insinuations that as long as you held the seals of the Foreign-office you did preserve the peace of Europe? and that sice you have had to assume under difficult circumstances the responsible office of Prime Minister, yon have by the wisdom of your administraion brought to an honomrable and satisfactory termination the war existing when you consented to accept those arduous duties."
The noble lord was deserted at a critical period by men who ought to have stood by him. When the Duke of Wellington in various conflicts found persons to quail before difficulties he said, "Do not talk to me about running away; all run away at times, and many of them never come back again." It appeared to him that many hon. and right hon. gentlemen were anxious to come back again. (Laughter.) He believed that their appetite, not only for debate, but for the goodtthingsof office, was very keen justnow. (Laughter.) Unless he could see his way more clearly than he did at present-and he was sorry to say that notwithstanding the attention that he had paid to the incomprehensible speechof the rght hon. gentleman the member for the Umversity of Oford, he was still himself in an incomprehensible position (laughter)-be ws inclined to foUow the noble lord the member for the city of London pro kdc vice, but he saw such dark clouds of electioneering electricity in all parts of the House that he thought he shouldi best discharge his duty by waking into the lobby with the hon. member for West Norfolk (Mr. Bentinok), regardless of the fewness of those who might take the same course.
Mr. WIMKINSON attributed the couree which had been adopted by the occupants of the Opposition benches towards the budget to mere vexation at the ChanceUor of the Exche-
uer's having, by his reduction of the estimates, prevented the assaultwhich they had intended to make the Government. He was not surprised at the ttX- of the righ hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamehire upon the budget, but he was greatly astonished at the violent terms in which the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford had spoken of it. The latter right hon. gentleman found fault with the estimates, but they were not yet before the House. He (Mr. Wilkinson) felt certain that, whether the estimates should be for 65,000,OOOL or 75,000,000L, the House would not withhold one sixpence of what was really required by the country. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) predicted that the Chancelor of the Exchequer would br nI
about a large deficiency in the revenue of the next two years, but that prophecy rested on the assumption that the expeniture for those two years would be as great as during the present, and that there would be no alteration in the public income. Now, it might be that the expenditure would be considerably less and the income considerably greater in the next two years. Even supposing that there should be deficiency, to what would it be owing but to those Exchequer-bonds which had been issued by the right hon. gentleman himself (Mr. Gladstone), and to the other parts of his plan for paying the expenses of the late war ? Atnd even as regarded the estimates of the present year, it might be that the Government would consent to a stil further reduction of them. He (hir. Wilkinson) approved the budget, with the exception of that part w^hich related to the tea duAties. The continual alteration of those duties greatly injured those engaged in the tea trade, and he should be lad to see some modification made in that part of the budget.
3r. LLDDELIL after the remarkable rhapsody from his (the Opposition) side of the House which seemed to excite so much pleasure on the Treasury bonch, desired to explain the course which he intended to take. He listened on Friday night with very great pleasure and attention to the able and temperate address of the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, but one part of it was uttered in a faltering tone. He seemed as though he himself felt that he was on rather delicate ground, for he turned round to his own friends and said that some members trembled at the word "reduction." With all respect to the right hon. gentleman, he (Mr. Liddell) confessed that he was one of those who felt considerable aDprehension at that word, unless he learly and unmistakably understood how the operation to which it referred was to be carried out. He had listened with great admiration to the speech of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford (Mr. Gladstone)-a speech which foreloquence and ability had perhaps never been equalled in that ouse ; but he had failed clearly to understand at what the right hon. gentleman aimed. (A laugh.) He (Mr. Gladstone) had pointed out that there must, according to the calculations which he placed before the House be a deficit in the year 1858-59; but in the
same speeCh ie had complained of the retention of the duties upon tea. In the strongest language which he (Mr. Liddell) had ever heard the right hon. gentleman had described the evil which would result to the poorer classes from retaining taxes which pressed upon articles of consumption, That agpeal had been responded to in many a far-off home, and th ere would be found great difficulty in removing the effects which it had produced. If, however, we were to lower the duties on these articles how were we to raise our revenue ? With the daties on spirits, on malt, and on tobacco it would be very dangerous to interfere, and he apprehended that, after the recent expression of feeling by the country,
no Chancellor of the Exchequer would look with much confidence to direct taxation as a means of raisinM a revenue. There was, however, one source to which he did not think sufficient importance bad been attached. The country would this year be released from the payment of 9,000,0001. of income-tax; and we might, without being too sanguine, anticipate that our trade, freed from such a burden, wonld spring up with fresh energies, and that its operations would be so extended as to lead to a oonsiderable increase of revenue. The right lon. gentleman (Mr. Glad-
tone looked only to the reduction of the estimates ;-znd thus i (MIr. Liddell) was aRain brought round to the ibwectith which he commenced his remarks. The H^se had been told a good deal about the budget of 1853. He did not wish to rake up old and long buried asperities, or to say anvthing which should offend tbe feelings of any man - but thero were circumstances attending that budget of 185N which it was necessary should at least be glaneed at. In'wbat condition did that budget find us when we went to war? We sent an army abroad, but we sent no supplies, and the army
perished for want of them. When too late, we were compelled, at anexpense the reckless extravagance of which was unknown iu the history of finance, to send out stores. which were too late; hut we had nO men whom we conld
end. to thkethew place of the army which e had lost. WVo senS out recruits, and they perished becauso they were not
disturbing c=rclmntaneas which will interfere with-the obserance of a compact. The war was such a disturbing eircumstance, and if the war ad lasted till 1860, then your cbmpact could not have been observed& (Hear, hear.) To that extent, therefore, you are perfectly justified in departiDR from the stipulation you maade, ana ould not do otierwise; but what I want to know"-ana press this argusment on the noble lord -is, wh are we in 1857, before we know what the expenditure of the country "ill be in la51 to reimpose a tax for 158 which you are bound by Act of Parliament to remit if you can? (Hear, hear.) I do not say that circumstances might not justifY You in reimposing it; butte o uh to postpone to 158 tke consideraton ofthat s
your simple proposition now ought tobetoremovethe war part of the tax, ana continue the 7d. tax simply for the present year. The noble lord has obserred that you have a much better chance of facilitating the entire abolition of ohe tax by the proposition of the Chancellor of the Exchequer than by agreeing to the resoluation proposed by the right hon. member for Buckinghamshire. The 7d. tax may in round numbers be computed to produce 7,000,0001.
and, considering the large apwhich the withdra.wal of 7,000,0001. would make ia the revenue, is there any beae in this House who believes that in 1860 you will have the means of filling up that gapm? (ear, hear.) The abolition. of te tax by means of the p reposition of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is, I au confndeut, practicnU imposble. (Hear,nhear.) Thequcroes the question,E wht, under the circumstances, ought yox to do? I say you ought carefully to inquire into the extant to which these estimates may be reduced before proceeding fuorther with these financial arranglements; but, whatever you do, I contend mtodently that nothing would be so unwise
and so unjust as. to reimpose tls tax, which yen aro - pieged to get rid of. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for West Norfolk has raiseid a uestion which I wil now pro. ceed to niotice. I consider that itl is the general rule, in ordinary times, first to ace what is the excpenditure you require, and then to rovide for that exNnditare by going into Committee of ways and Means. That unquestionably is the general practice; but it is departed from, and has been departed from, by the bent authorities who ever sat within these wan,s. And are not the circumstance under ,which it has beea departed from similar to thes whoic
nw p resent themHose ves? (No th ) The condition unader which the rule has been departed from is when there is something unusu wito respect to the expenditue and revenue of the country, which requires on the part of the House that our whole financial state shouldbe brought before us. it wasearlyin February,1845, and,asI believe, justbefore we voted the estimates, and not in a Committee of Supply, thht air Robett Peie proposed the renewal of the incometax. When the noble lord the membeo for the city of London proposed, in 1848, its renewal and increase from Sk
to 5. er cent, he thought proper to lay before the House the whlle of the wfsys ad meancs of the country before the supplies cameon. These Icall the twobestauthorities,not only ofourown, butof any preceingtimes, for the guidance of this House in y attrs of this description. (Hear, hear.) miam net ahamed to follow in the wake of such athoritye and , ask the House whether the circumstances in which we now stand are not as peculiar as those of either of the periods to which I have referred ? OhFe.rve how we stand. We have just terminated an arduous and expensive war. The Miistry has yet to consider what ought now to be the peaoe etblishment of the country. At the present goment we are wholy uninformed As to what are the views of Her Majesys Government
thatsubject,iand i contend that ifyouo onvoting espplie which are to be dlerivea from in d ion uon tea and sugar an p u n dtheincomesof the peopteyfithispcountry not merely in this but ion futuer. hea re you knte whether that taxation will b ur you Il viat all these first principles to which ths louse ha
ever felt itself bound to ahre. Ths hou ought to insist upon obtaining f before it actually proceeds thuLst provd for the revenue of future years, and thie obtaining of that information is the object of the notion of MY right hen, friend the member for Beculnghamshire. I betlve that that motion, ever since this debate commenced, has aone much good Hear, hear.) I see it in the materially altered tone with reference to the estimates which were orially pro pos.a (hear, Hear), and alo with reference tod the taxation which is about to be placed upon the people. (Efear, hear.
It does not reonire Any great sagacity to predict, as some of the good effecvs likely o flow fiom this discussion, first, that the tea duties wll not be increased; seconily, that the estimates willmnot stand as they are; and, thirdly, that the incomne-tax will not he raised to 7Id. in the pound until we know that the expenditure of the country indispensably requires sach addition. (Cheers.) There is something in the mode in which the income-tax has beenr renewed from time to time that specially requires our attention. It was first proposed in 1842, and was granted on the necessity of the case. When the Duke of Wentgton, the leader of the Gtoveniment in the Houseof Lords, was asked how long it wasto continue, he e aid,I"As long as it is necessary, and not one morent longer. Itwas renewedat thea nd ofthe first triennial period-viz., in 1845. Sir R. Peel laid the case fairly before the House of Commons. He told them that they were in a position, if they chose, to do away with the tax, but that its retention for another triennialtperiod would enable thema to continue the remission of other taxes. The House deliberately sanctioned the reimposition of the income-tax for another period of three years. But an alarmige cireumstance occurred in the interval .A letter was written by Sir R. Peel to merchauts at Elbing that seemed to imply that the taox was likely to be made permanent instead of temporary. The right hen. baronet alluded to the necessityof a juster principle of taxation being introduced. His expressions were misunderstood, and he afterwards explained in this House that what he desired to sec effected was the remission of aluduties un osa articles which did not pay for the colection. the noble lord the member for th Ucity of Londn swas at the bead of the Government at the end of the seconad triennial period. He proposed not only the renewal of, but an addition to the income-tax. The circumstances of the country had been peculiar. There wasab greathpressure upon trade. The commercial crisis h a ae ned, and a gigantic famine had desolated the homes of many thousands of famiies. What did the House say when that proposition was made? With one voice the House said, "1 We wil have no addition to that tax " and that ~art of the proposition was withdrawn, althonih the noble ord and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of that day told the Hoer that the state of the country required that Addition, and that without fresh taoation the Government could not be carried en. A third triennial period expired in 1851 and so strong was the feeling of the House as to the necessity of modifying the tax,so as to make it equal in its opruation, that they insisted on its not being continued for onger than another year. At the end of that year my right heon,friend who sits beside me (Mr. Disraeli) was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Two courses were then before him - modification or abolition. He aug. gested modification. The House rejected his budget acnd the Ministryn with him. My right henr friend the mem,ber for the University of Oxford succeeded, and the same two alternatives were before him. fe clearly showed that you could notximakethe tax equal hy merely attempting to adjust the difference between precarious and fxed incomes, and that you could merely look to the gross receipts. He therefore proposed its abolition, but he accompanied that proposal by the compact tobwhich I have referred.t; and from that time to this, or rather until Frilay evenng last, nobody, I believe, ever dreamt that there was a chance of that compact not being strictly fulfilled. (Hear, hear.) But an observation has been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which, if it had been madoeby any other person, I should have thought hadrslipped out of his mou^th in the warmth of deb?ate. There is. however, no gentleman in this House more thoughtful in his speeches thav e the. Chancellor of the Exchequer. (Hear, hear.) It is a pleasure to listen to him. (Hear. And therefore I attribute more weight to his words than would to those who speak mnore hastily and less clearly. In, the passge to which I desire to call the par, tiscular attention of the House he seemed to sntimate that he could not state, not merely whether there was a probability, hut even a possibility, of getting rid of the incomet he in r 860. Hiswords weretheseA
rAll persons must wish that any noxious tax, which the income-tHx is alledged to be, ishould, by the increasing prospesity of the country, be found unnecessary for the public service.sut it seemns to me thsat we cannot bind ourslaes down to anuy sort of plege, or to any formal confession of faith as to the posesbility or probability of Parliament being able to remit the incometax in1860."
These are alarming words (hear, hear), and I think that no course which could be proposed would be more calculated to disperse the alarm which they have'kreated than the adoption of the resolution which has been proposed. (Hear, hear.) Are we to be toldI that a MHinister of the Crown can entertain a doubt whether an engagement-a moral compact with the peeple, as I have proved the promise as to the cessation of the income-tax in 1860 to be-is to be fulfilled ? (Hear, hear.) Are weto betold onxthehighest authority in this House on such matters that he cannot form an opinion as to the probability or even the possibility of the fulfilment of that engaement? That enga4ement must be adhered to, for the honour of this Houseisa at stake. (Hear, hear.) The people of the country expect its fulfilmenLt. Unless we adhere to it the confidence which they have hitherto reposed in this House will be materially weakenedl, if not destroyed. Under these circumastances, feeling stronigly that we want some more assurance from the Governmenit with reference
to this fnancial engagement, I cordially support the resolution which my right hon. friend has moved. I support that rezolution because, in fact, it amounts to this-an instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means that no budget will be satisfactory to us or the comntry unless it secures by a proper adjustment of revenue and expenditure the fulfilment of the pledge so solemnly given in 1853, and from which we cannot depas I without a breach of faith and a violation of all principle. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. CARDWELL.-I cannot help feeling, Sir, when I listen to the able speeches by which this resolution is recommended to the House, that the motion itself rests on two distinct grounds-the advocacy of one of which points to a line of action different from that im. plied by the advocacy which sustains the other branch of it. When I hear those able statements which point to the bcttomless pit of deficiency in which we are told the present financil arrangements wiU leave the country, I naturally expect to hear the speaker close with a proposal for a higher scale of taxes; and when I hear eloquent speeches in favour of a reduction of expenditure I naturally expeot the conclusion to be that we shaU go into the Committee of Ways and Means, where, assuming that our expenditure is diminished, we may afford to the people of this country that just remission of taxation on which their whole attention is centred, on which their opinion is made up, and which we, I think, on both sides of the House unanimously believe to be both expedient and just. (Hear, bear.) I am confirmed in that opinion when I hear my right hon. friend who last sat down commence his able speech by proclaiming that in every material fact and argument, in every premise which should lead him to a conclusion, he entirely concurred with the noble lord the member for the city of London. Is it not strange, Sir, that men of such
tObhitted at so strange a proceeding on the pMartyo
my right hon. friend. I could not understand est The only possible object of the language which be has latterly held sieems to be to fix us with extravagant aid waeful elimer s If we did not bring forward such estimates of ourselties he was determained to do it for us; ald then when he found his expectations disappointed, inas-
iuch as our estimates were not hir estimates, he insinoutes that we have altered our plans, and that the estimates now submitted are net the estimates alluded to in Her Majesty's gracious Speech. Sir, I am sorry to destroy a favourite theory, but I can awsure my right hon. friend that the estinates were fixed at their present amount a week before ParliamJ nt met. (Hear.) My own estimates were laid -upon the table the first day on which the forms of the House Cowed t
they were delivered in print the morning following, and, had the forms of the House permitted, the might have been distributed tf o or three dfays before. We framed our estimates, as the right hon. gentlemn said we should, conscientiously beleving that they were requ.ire for the service of the country; we redueed them as far as we thought they could be reduced consistently with the requirements of the year ; and I trust when the time comes and we are allowed to go into Comiittee of Supply that we shall be able to justify touresttes, he uld convner theomue that we have

I ws tnished, too, at the state of excitement in which he seemed to he. He used language towvards the Chancellor of the Exchequer hardly decent for one gentleman to use towards another ; e lectured his old colleagues in a tone the justice of whisch may by and bye allude to; and he

So far as the mere resolution itself goes, I don't knowv that I need say much more, but in the course of the debate attaks have been made upon the Government and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which, I think, call upon us for some explanation and defence. We are told that we have deserted the principles of the budget of 1853. We are remninded that we, too, were parties to that budget. I entirely admit the truth and justice of that statement. I entirely approve both of the taxation which was imposed and of that which was taken off in 1853; and I fully admit-indeed, I am glad to admit-that by the plan of taxation then agreed upon a reasonable prospect vas afforded that in 1860 the income-tax would cease. I must, however, be permitted to combat the notion of a compact or engagement binding either in the sense in which it seems to be used by the right lion. gentlemian opposite or by my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone). The right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Walpole) overthrew his own argument. If a compact made by a Minister in 1853 to bind a possible auccessor in 1860, seven years afterwards, is not binding- under altered circumstances, such as in the case of a war and its accompanying expenditure, it must be necessarily left to the discretion of the Minister and the Parliament of the day to say whether the circumstances are such as to enable them to execute the intention of the Government. It is impossible that any engagement entered into by Parliament can be stronger than tabt. It is impossible for a Parliament to bind its successors. (Hear, hear.) I confess that after what was said by the right hon. gentleman opposite on this subject I looked witli some anxiety to see whether any such positive engagement had been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1853. Of course, as a member of the then existing Cabinlet, I hold myself responsible for the system of taxation then imposed; but I was a little alarmed at the language of the right hon. gentleman as to the compact in question, and I took occasion to refer to the words made use of by my right hon. friend in brin'ing forward the budget of 1853. On that occasion he said:-
" I think it also most desirable tbat effectual measures should betaken to mark this tax as a temporary tax. (Opposition cries of I Hear.') By this I do not mean merely, or chiefly, that I would commit the Government to an abstract opinion to be acted upon in future yetus. My own opinion is decidedly against the perpetuity of the tax as a permanent ordinary portion of our fnances. Butwhile I state the wish of the Government to propose it as a temporary tax I do not ask you to rely on their words to bind them or yourselves, irrespectively of what may occur in the interinm, as to what you will do, under aU circumstances, at the expiration of the term which we propose to fix for its continuance now. Ipropose, by positive enactment, bythe measures which I shall invite you to adopt, to lay the ground for lacing Parliament in such a position that at a given perioit may, if it think fit, part with that tax." (Opposition cheers.)
Well, Sir, I agree with every syllable of that explanation. I agreed with it then, and I agree with it now. My ri ht hon. friend said that he could not expect to bind the C. verament or Parliament, but he would endavour to put Parliament in such a position that it might, if it thought fit, take off the tax in 1860. Now, so say I and so says my right hon, friend (the ChanceUor of the Exchequer) at the present moment. The Chancellor of the Exchequernever says he will bind Parlameutinl860, buthedoesnothing inconsistentwith the remission of the tax in that year, and if there be a difficulty in this respect it wi arise not out of the proposal of my right hon. friend, but from circumstances over which we have no permanent controL (Hear.) The right hon. gentleman says that by the proposal we are making we do nothing towards taing off the income-tax in 1860. Now, Sir, the proposal which we are about to make is one to enable us to provide for the payment of Trepsurv-bonds ; and surely every obligation which we discharge and every proportion of debt which we pay off place us in a better position to dispense with the income-tax in 1860. (Hear, hear.) Therefore it is not only incorrect to say that what we are doing tends in the slightest possible degree to perpetuate the income-tax, but, on the other hand, it is perfectly true that what we are doing tends, as far as it goes, to render it possible for Parliameat to repeal that tax iu the year 1860. Now, Sir, let us look a little to the past. In the year 1854 came the war, and no one was more unwillingly convinced of the necessity of that war than myself, but when the necessity for it was clearly established it became necessary to provide for the expenses connected with it. Well, Sir, my right hon. friend in his statement the other evening-and a long enough statement it was-referred to the economy of former and the extravagance of later years. He said that in the 12 years ending in 1854 there had been little or no increase in the expenditure of the country, but that since that period there had been a considerable increase. I should have thought myself that the 12 years preceding 1854 being years of peace and the yeas since then having been years of war would have been sufficient to account for that circumstance, even if the statement were entirely correct. In point of fact, however, my right hon. friend was not correct in that statement, for there was a considerable increase of expenditure between 1842 and 1854-an increase of no less than 3,366,0001. Well, Sir, in the year 1854 it became the duty of my right hon. friend, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, to provide for a war expenditure ; aud he did so, partly by a loan and partly by taxation, that taxation- being partl
direct and partly indirect. And what were the taxes which he increased ? Why, Sir, they were the income-tax and the duties upon malt, sugar, spirits, and tea. He did not do what one might expectfrom his speech on Fridaylast thathewouLd have done-namely, place all the increase upon one species of article ; but he took one great item of directtandafour items of indirect taxation, those itema being the very ones with which my right hon. friend now proposes to deal. I quite concur in the course adopted by my right hon. friend in 1854, and think that it would have beens impolitic to have acted otherwise; but that was precisely the same course which is now adopted by my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The right hon. gentleman says, because *ny right hen. friend proposes to increase the tax upon more than one article, it may be inferred that he is going to impose taxes upon more articles than those from which taxes have been taken away in past years. Now, nothing could be more absurd. Why, the right hon. gentleman himself in 1854 imposed taxes upon more than one article, and even to a greater extent than my right hon. fri,nd, carried out the principles of Arthur YouDn, and yet he now turns upon my right hon. friend and tells him that his policy is a retrograde policy, that he is departing from those principles which have been acted upon for 15 years, and al because he adopts, although in a less degree, the course taken by the right hon. gentleian himself in 1853. (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir, in last year the war came to an end, and, as regards the war taxes, the war tax on nat ceased in July lastO,and the additional duties on coffee, sugar, and tea would cease on the 5th of April next, The Eouse has already been informed that the income-tax wiU be reduced 9d., and I need, perhaps, hardly say that the Government never entertained the slightest intention of availing themselves of a technicality to continue that impost. There has been a great deal of quibbling as to whether we are reducing or imposing taxes, but they are mere quibbles upon words. The hon. and learned member for Wa=lmgford has put the case very fairly. He said do not seek to avail your. selves of the technical language of the Act, but throw yourselves upon the House of Commons to vote the necessry aupplies. I am quite content to take that position, and to
dea with the question as if all war taxes had oeased. Then how should we stand ? We niust come back to the peace income calculated in 1853. Now, in the first place, there has been a considerable reduction in the estinated sum which would be produced by the succession duty. My right hon. friend in 1853 calculated that before now that tax would produce 2,000,0001. It has, however, produced onl about 500,000t. Therefore, the estimated income has suf fered a loss of 1,500,0001., but that loss has been mainly made up for by the duty upon spirits. Well, if the arrangement of 1853 be so inding, there is already one failure in it. Well, Sir, to touch upon the expenditure of the country. How does the deficiency estiumated by my right hon. friend for next year occurl Why, it is in point of fact strictly war exDenditure. It is caused by paying Treasury bonds which were rendered necessary by the war, and whether a charge occasioned by the war be paid in 1855 or by Treasury bonds due in 1857, the exjpenditure is equaUy a war expenditure. Now, can it be said that the scheme proposed by my right hon. friend for defraying that expenditure, together with the expenditure of the year, is one jot more a departure from the settlement of 1853 than was the plan of the right hon. gentleman in 1854? If it were consisteut with the settlement of 1853 to impose taxes upon tea, sugar, malt, and spirits in 1854, how can it be inconsistent to do so when now, as then, there is a war expenditure to be' met? The expenditure now is of the same description as it was then; iwhy should not the taxation be the same? Whether the right hon. gentleman did er did not depart from sound prmnciples in 1854, he cannot now blame my right hon. iriend, who has only followed in his steps, without blaming
as astonished that he could rise in his place dy right hon. friend for adopting precisely the same cour6 he him,self aded three years aro. ell,
w the ease? My right hon. friend has ;selected the articles for taxation s that tbe consumer will be relieved, although the revenue will be increased.
f,irlien you go into Committee of Supply, you consider the esthnates too high, it will be your dtty to reduce them. If, on the contrary, you find that they are justified by the proposals we have made, then you may be satisfied that we have provided ways and means for defraying the proposed expendiuure and leaving a reasonable but not a le - plus. My right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone) thought fit to lecture the ChauceUor of the Exchequer and to lecture the Government for the course they have pursued. The right hon. gentleman must forgive me for protesting ainst his right to lecture us in such a manner. I admit the suceriority of my right hon. friend's talent and ability. admit that he is a more able advocate of the doctrines of free trade than I can pretend to be; but I am at least a old as my right hon. friend (a laugh), and I think myself quite as well qualifed to judge whether a particular course is or is not a departure from the principles of free trade. I think I am as little likely as the right hon. gentleman to desert the principles upon which I have acted ever since I came into Parliamennt. I supported those principles in adverse circumstances. I voted against the Corn IAws 25 years ago, and the ftrst thing I had to do as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to put an end to the last monopoly-but one of the most mischievous monopolies-that ever existed. I therefore do not regard myself as open to the censure of the right hon. member for the University of Oxford. That right hon. gentleman must be acquitted of any departure from the sound principlei of free trade- but I cannot acquit bin of the language which he was pleased to hold with regard to spy right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. (Iear, hear.) It is right enough that general principles should be discussed in this House. It is proper that every member of the Government should be prepared to take a part in general political discus. sions, but it is impossible for all the Ministers to be so fully, acquainted with the details of other departments than their own as to be enabled to answer offhand the various questions that may be put as to the business of those depart. ments. It is, therefore, not only for the advantage of the Minisers but of the House that al matters of detal of that kind should be discussed in committees of the House. The estimates are moved in Committee of Supply, in order that the Ministers may be ableto answerthevarious questions that are addressed to them. The taxes are pro. posed in Committee of Ways and Means, where the oppor tunity of ful inquiry is afforded. My right hon. friend(the Chancellor of the Exchequer) could not reply to the unjustifiable attack that was made upon him the other night, and in that respect he was placed in an unfair position. The right hon. member for the University of Oxford attacked the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a degree of acrimony and violence which I greatly regretted, and which was not justifled by anything that had faUen from my right hon. friend. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) said-and I was surprised to hear such expressions apolied by one gentleman in this House to another-that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had misrepresented what he was doing, that he had deceived the House, and that his assertions-not as to matters of argument, but as to matters of fact-were untrue. The right hon. gentleman imputed to the Cbancellor of the Exchequer that he had stated that the effect of the resolutions he was about to propose would be to relieve the country this year from burdens amounting to upwards of 11,000,0001. Such an assertion would no doubt have been untrue, but it so happens that it was never made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The misrepresentation was, indeed, on the part of the right hon. member for the University of Oxford, and not on the part of the Chancelor of the Exchequer. My right hon. friend distinctly said that the malt-tax ceased on the 5th of July last. He stated the amount of loss, and he said that the greater part of that loss resulted from the repayment of a drawbacke. The right hon. member for the University of Oxford said the Chancelor of the Exchequer held out to the country the expectation of rehef from the income-tax to the extent of 9,000,0001. in consequence of his propositions. The Chancelor of the Exchequer made no such statemnent. He said, on the contrary, that the committee must recollect that owing to arrears now due a considerable amount of the high rate of income-tax would be receivable in the present year, and that the full effect of the reduction would not be felt until the ensuing year. It was, I think, impossible for any one to guard himself more carefully than my right hon. friend in stating to the House thetruth andthewhole truth upon these points, and it is not true that he represented in any way that the grace and virtue of these remissions were to be attributed to the resolution he was about to' lacoe in the hands of the Chairman of Ways and Means. That was the assertion of the right hon. member for the University of Oxford, charging the Chancellor of the Exchequer with misrepresentation and falsehood. I say that it is a charge utterly unjustified by the facts. The Chancelor of the Exchequer made no such statement; what he said was directly the reverse. Be it observed, too, that the speech of my righthon.friend (the Chancellorof the Exchequer) was not made on the same evening as the attack of t4e right hon. member for the University of Oxford. It was made on the previous Friday, and a whole week had elapsed between the statement and its misrepresentation. I must say I never was more surprised or more pained than to bear such language as that to which I have referred, and which I think ought not to have been addressed by one gentleman to another, reproaching the Chancellor of the Exchequer for statements he had never made. (Some ironical shouts of "HIear.") I am sorry that any hon. gentlemen seem to think it a matter of no importance that the character of a public man should be unjustly assaited. (Cries of " No, no,' and cheers.) The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) then turned upon me and told me that I had stated that the income-tax ought to be a perpetual tax. I certainly do not remember ever having expressed such an opion. I havereferredto the Parhamentary debates, and I mLuch that I said in a totally different sense. I cannot, however, find a word indicating an opinion on my part that the income-tax ought to be perpetuaL I wi give the right hon. gentleman the full advantage of one passage which is the only one I can find that affords the slightest ground for his statement. I said in 1851, when I proposed the renewal of the income-tax,-
" With the common concurrence of the House of Commons for some years past, with the general approbation of the contry, and certamnly to its great advantage, we have been repealing and reducing the taxes which press either upon the industry or the consuming power of the country, and I do not believe that it wil be possible to reimpose those taxes. I believe further that there are many taxes stiU remaining on the statute-book which it would be most desirable to reduce, taxes which eitherin their amountorin the mode of their levy, are far more objectionable, far more oppressive, and far more unjust than the income-tax Sir, when those taxes have been so reduced and repealed, when the duties upon the raw material have been taken off, when those duties which interfere with the process of manufacture have been reduced, vwhen the inequalities, the anomalies, and the injustice which prevail in some portions of our taxation are removed when the duties on imports and the excisoe are so reduced that the consurner can no longer be said to be hardly pressed upon, then I think the question will fairly arise whether it is expedient further to relieve the consumer or remove a
ortion of the burdens from the property of the country. ut until that iS done, until we have removed the imperfections of our fiscal system, until we have carried out and completed that course of commercial policy which we have been pursuing for someyears past, and the happy results of which have been felt by the country at large, as I stated only three or four nights ago, both financially, politically, andsociaUy,-undl thst has been done I hope that neither thisnor any other House of Commons will refuse to continue that tax, under the cover of which, as an hon. gentleman truly said the other night, those changes which have proved so beneficial to the country have been accomplished."
I have no doubt that the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) agreed with me when I made that declaration, which is in no respect inconsistent with the hope and expectation that, as soon as those changes were effected, this House might and wouldrepceal that tax, which Ihave been anxious to see removed as soon as it was possible to dispense with it. (Cheers.) The charge now made against the Government is the possibility of a deficiency of revenue in 1858-9. All that we can do now is simply to deal with taxation, and the only course which can be taken is to impose a larger amount of taxes than the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes. Is that what hon. gentlemen mean by voting for the resolution of the right hon. gentleman opposite l [did not catch very distinctly what was the proposition which the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford intended to make; and I own that after hearing him I left the House very much puzzled, because he seemed to object to everything and to propose nothing, while every succeeding argument which he used appeared to be in direct contradiction of that which had gone before. (Hear, hear.) He complained of the excess of taxation, and at the same time he found fault with the Chancellor of the Excbequer for adopting as the basis of expenditure the establishments of JlM5, stating that the real wants of the country were msore likely to increase than to diminish. But it seemed to me, and I should like to know from the right hon. gentleman whether I am correct or not, that there wag this proposition contained in his speech :-He stated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was rtuning a risk and pursuing a course which was unjustifiable, and for which he would not be responsible, in voting away the war 9d. atthe end of thisyear. If that meantanythingitimeant, I presume, that the right hon. gentleman's proposition wouldbheto continue the wa-.9d. for ayear longer,. WouldA
that be the proposal of the right hon. gentle-ran Was that
his meaning ? (HIear, hear.) If it were not, he leaves us in the happy situation of having had no surgestion made to us, -no course indicated which could by any posibility meet
the deficiency which he contemplated as so threatening in future years. (Hear, hear.) The only mode, then, which has been suggested of meeting that deficiency is that of the right bon. gentleman opposite, not to impose any additional tax for the ensuing year; and the way in which we are to provide for taking off the income-tax in 1860 is-with little prospect, according to his view, of a diminished expenditure-to provide a fund of taxation less than that which was proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I leave the House to judge what prospect that affords of removing theincome-taxinl860. Therighthon.gentlemanthe member the University goes even further, for he would refuse tos
pend the decrease in the tea and sugar duty, and he threatens also to repeal the duties upon hLre insurance and on paper, and to reduce the duty on wine. Where do hon.
gentlemen think, then, that the means of making up the icome-tax, if it be taken off, are to come from ? The Chancellor of the Exchequer refuses to pledge himself to the certainty of removing the income-tax in 160, but he at least proposes a course which tends, so far as it goes, to render it possible, while those who voto for the resolution of the right hon. gentleman, so far as he has indicated any course at all, propos toaot a plan which will render it more difficult if not imposile, to obtLain that which I believe to be the great object Of the House and of the country. (Cheers, and cries of "Divide 1"1) I will not trouble the ouse much longer, but I must say a word or two with reference to the comments of the hen, mem'ber for Wick upon the estimates of the year. We htave reduced the navy and army estimates by one-half as compared with last year, and I do not believe that it is possible to reduce them furtber in the
'course of the present year. Hon. gentlemen have referred
to the many dificulties w hich beset a Minister who has to effect reductions, and I w,ill not dwell, therefore, upon that p art of the subject. It is, however, as the House may wvell
believe, a painful thing to reduce the wtages of men who have faithfully senved their country in time of war, and to
carry such retrenchments into effect; and I can assure you that, as it is impossible to bring up establishments to a war footingia a single year, to itis impossible at oned and improvidently to reduce them. If peace continue, no doubt the eatimates next year may be lower than those of the present year, thou to what extent they will be lower I will not pled;ge myself. The estimates of each year depend upon the circumstances of the year, and, if we go into Supply, we shall endeavour to justify the estimates of the present year a3s they stand. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the income-tax, I repudiate any compact or engagement; and all that we can promris , to do nothing which shall render it less possble to remove the income-tax in 1860 than it would otherwise be. The right hon. gentleman opposite will not even continue that impost beyond this year; but if he do not he will be unable next year to repay the Treasury bonds, which will thus run into future years, and will render it more impossible than ever to take off the income. tax. We, on the other hand, provide for the income and expenditare of the year, leaving a reasonable surplus in the Exchequaer at its termination,and we provide also means for ensuing years, so far as taxation goes; but the exenditure of those years we cannot provide for. In conclusion, I earnestly call upon the House to reject now the motion of the right hon. gentleman, and I hope that on future opportunities you will reject also both those other motions, the effect of which, if carried, will be to impede our goimg into committee. (Cheers.)
3fr. GLADSTONE.-After the speeeh of my right hon. friend who has just sat down I have no option but to ad. dress a few words to the House; but they shall be offered in explanation only, and not with the intentioii of making use of the privilege which technicaUy and formaly Ishould have acquired in consequence of the motion -which has been made by the hon. gentleman opposite. (Hear, hear.) My right hon. friend twice told me that in speakimg upon this subject on Friday night I applied language to the Chancelor of the Exchequer which it is hardly decent for one gentleman to apply to another. Hetrrig my right hon. friend make that severe charge, I was in hopes that he would have quoted my exact words, and that he would not have been content with deac ribing in general terms the language which I used; because neitber 1, nor, perhaps, any person, can feel entirely certain of what may have been the strict bearing of the observations which may have fallen from him in the heat of debate. Bat if I used any ls. guage which, when fairly construed, can be said to impute to my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Fxcbequer the shadow of anything that is dishonourable or unbecoming his high character and position, itis not my duty only, but my pleasure, at once to apologize for language so unintentionally employed. (Cheers.) But mny right hon. friend says that I charged the Chancellor of the Exchequer with having deceived the House, with misrepresentation, aud with falsehood; and my right hon. friendthere can be no mistake about that-charges me with misrepresentation in return. Of that I make no complaintbut I wish that he had quoted the words in which he thought that I charged misrepresentation and falsehood on the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mly desire was to make no such charge; but I said that, without the smallest inten. tion on thopartof tbeChancellor of the Excbequer, undoubtedly the statements which he made had conveyed erroneous impressions to the House, and that not merely with respect to a matter of argument, but with respect to a matter of fact; and particularly I stated that the language of the Chancellor of the Exchequer-although I don't doubt that it was accidentally he fell into the error-had distinctly conveyed to the country that, in virtue of his propositions, 11,970,0004 of taxes were about to be remitted. That was the point on which I thought that the statement of my right hon. friend had misled the country. Now, I believe thatI heard correctly and described correctly the language of my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the public journals, too, of the next day, we saw that these 12,000,0001. of taxes were going to be remitted; and, on referring to that paper which is considered to have contained the best report of our proceedings, I fird the following put down as the words of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer:-
"The total amount of taxation which I propose to take off in the present year wil be found in the following table:I Malt-tax, loss in 1857-8 (in addition to 200,000. in 1856-7), 2.000,0001.; income-tax (to be reduced to 7d. and 5d.), 9,125,0001. ; tea (to be reduced from ls. 9d. to ls. 7d. per lb.), 369.0001.; coffee (to be reduced from 4d. to 3d. per lb.), 135,000; sugar (to be reduced from an average of *4s. 4d. to 13s. 4d.), 342,00014; total reduction, 11,971,000.' Of this total of 11,971,0001., about 7,600,0001, wiU be a deduction from the Exchequer receipts for the ensuing year, 1857-8."1-The Timcs, Feb. 14.
That statement undoubtedly contains very serious errors in matters of fact, and is calculated to produce most erroneous conclusions. At the same time I beg, in the most public manner, to say that if any word fel from me which I ought not to have used, and which may have given pain to the sight hon. gentleman, I only wish to have it recalled to my recolection, in order that I may express my great sorrow for having used it. (Loud cheers.)
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUIER.-I regret that my right hon. friend should have supposed that anything which he said on a former evening has been interpreted as imputing intentional deceit or untruth. At the same time the language which he used did convey in very distinct terms to my mind the idea that I had, in order to support my argument, and to obtain undue advantage and reputation to the Government, laid before the House a statement substantially deceptive and untrue. (Hear.) Now, on looking at the reports of the words which I used I can find nothing that is not consistent with the most exact trath and correctness, except one expression which I used, I presume, but which I must have used inadvertently. I said, "I propose to remit," instead of saying"the foUowing taxes will be remitted." (Loud cheers.) If I used the expression "the foUowing taxes will be remitted," nothing could be more exact than the statement I made. (Cheers) It meant the taxes that would bh remitted in the ensuing year as compared with the whole taxation of the previous year. My object was to lay before the House a comr arison between the war taxation of the previous year and the reduced peace taxation of the ensuing year. Tho House wiU remember that I had occasion to address them, unfortunately, at very great length. This statement occurred at the end of my speech, and I was anxious not to trespass beyond what was absolutely necessary; therefore if I made an error it arose from brevity and the want of due explanation. But I feel satisfied that if anybody wiUl examine the words which I used he will see that I stated with perfect distinctness the result of the proposition which I made. I stated the total amount of the taxes remitted. I showed how much would be raised by the Exchequer in the foUowing year, and how much would go over to the ensuing year. Therefore, those very words which my right hon. friend read told against the assumption that the whole of that saving would be true within the limits of the year. (Hear, hear.) Another charge made against me of deliberate misrepresentation and of an attempt to deceive the House and the country is involved in the question whether I represented the remission as for the year or in the year. WlhAt I wanted to say was that it was a remission of taxes for the ensuing year. My right hon. friend charges me with having said it was a remission in the year. I certainly did not mean to make that statement; and if you compare the statements of former Finance Ministers with regard to remissions of taxation you wil never find that a distinction is made between the remission of taxes for the ensuing year and that portion which, in regard to payment of arrears, accidentaUy occurs within the year. (Hear, hear.) But though it is trae that with regard to the income-tax andother taxes credit is given, and though It appears that the tax which is due in respect of one year does not become applicable tiU the enuuing year, nevertheles from the time that the repeal takes place the tax entirely ceases. If, for example, the resolutions which I have given notice to move in a Committee of Ways and Means with regard to the income-tax should receive the assent of the committee, aud a Bill founded on them should receive the assent of the Honse, the entire income-tax in April next would be reduced to 7d. in the pound. No portion of income tax arising after the 5th of April next will beminore than 7d. I caU that the remission of the income-tax for the year ending the 5th of April next. (Hear, hear.) It is quite true that taxes upan income arising before the 5th of April next wiU be applicable after that day; but that does not prevent the repeal of the tax coning into operation from that day. For example, a mechanic receiving 21. a-week who wiU be liable to income-tax will cease to pay after the 5th of April. So, also, any person who compares the different parts of my statemcnt willUsee that it is explained that the malt tax ceased on the 5th of July last. I stated the amount of drawback, and bow much was raised within the preceding and the past year - and I cannot think that anyone who will look through the details will suspect that I wished to take credit to myself for a remission of taxes already received. (He-ar, hear.) The very fact of my proposing resolutions only relating to the income-tax and those on tea and sugar would at once sbow that I did not wish to take credit for the remission of the malt tax. (Hear.) So far from there being any intention on mny part to make a false impresslon, 1 made the fullest explnation in my power. (Lond cheers.)
The House divided upon the motion for the ad- I jourrnent of the debate, when there voted,-
For the adjourm ent ... ... ... 25 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 477
Majority against M1r. Bentinck's motion -452 The announcement of the numnbers -was received with much laughter.
The House then proceeded to divide on Mr. Disraeli's amendment, wvhen the numbers appeared,-
For the amendment ... ... 206 For going into Committee... ... 286
Majority for Government ... -80
The numbers were announced amid loud cheers.
The House accordingly resolved into aCommittee of Ways and Means.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEIEQUER said that if any objection were made to proceeding with the two resolu- I
tions on the income-tax he should, of course, he ready to I
move that the Chairman report progress; but if there should I be no objection on the part of the committee to agree to those resolutions, which would enable a Bill to be h rought in to carry into effect the arrangement he had pronosed, that the tax on incomes above 1501. a-year should be 7d. in
the pound for the next three years, and on incomes below that amount 5d. in the pound, then he would beg leave to move the resolutions.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER formally moved the resolution as follows:-That towards raising the supply granted to Her Majesty there shall be raised annually, during the term of three years from the 5th day of April, 1857, in lieu of the rates and duties chargeable during the samc period, under the several Acts now in force relating to the income-tax, for andin respect of all pro-
perty, profits, and gains, chageable under the said Acts, the rate and duty of 7d. for every 20s. of the annual valuo or amount of all such property, profits, and pinas repectively.
The resolution having been read a first time,
Mr. DISRAELI moved that the Chairman report pro. gress.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER did not object, and the Houseresumned.

Lord PALMERSTON moved that the select Committeo on this Bill should consist of the followig members:-Lord J. Russell, MIr. Walpole, the Solicitor-GeneraJ, Mr. Cobden,
ley, lfr. Dleedes, Mrr.G 0. lutt, Mr.0.G A.X aiton, Merk.
ngbam, Mr. K. Seymer, Sir W. Somerville, and Mr.
Mr. P. O'BRIEN observed that there was only one Iish member's name on the proposed committee, and thought that the list needed amendment in that respect, but
Mr. WI'CANN could not see what Ireland had to do with bribery, aud regretted that there was a single Irish member's name on the list. (Laughter.)
Lord PALMERSTON defended the composition of the committee, whose attention would be directed not so much to local matters as to general principles.
The whole of the names were then agreed to, and the House adjourned at 1 o'clock.

Sir,-3ry attention has been called to the following paragraph, reflecting on myself, and which has been copiea out of the Boniay lTimes into certain of the London journals :
" The 'Bomba6y Times' hag obtained Pmpossion of a singular document. It is a copy of an agemeut between Meer Jeiar AlU. the Nuwab of Surat, and Nusur All Khan, heir presumptive to the throne of Gude, in whiich the latter assians to Jaltfr Ali the sole conduct. ot his case.' Sbould the throne o Oude be restored, Meer Jaffr Is to recive a pension of three lakhs per anbum. Should the Oude prince not smoceedt in enforcing his claims, a suit in Cha.ncery is to be brought against the Hast India Company for aU the suris subtcribe by the Oude family to tbe Gover,ment loans from 1811 to 155. If the uit succeeds. Jaflir Ali'. Pession is in be a lakh and frhalf. If the king repudiates the contract, the heir apparent is to observe it on his fathen's death. The agreemenit was sworn to on the Koran by both parties. in the sence of a large number of witneases, and Ja dated Harley-bouse, fLondon, November?7,1856.'
In reply to this circumstantial statement I am able to declare that such an agreement as that described above was never entered into or contemplated; that nothing resembling it ever occulrred to either of the parties mentioned, and that, in short, there is no foundation whatever for the

'29,106 78 in copper coins, and composed of 25,876,288 pieces. The coinage largely exceeds the deposits. This arises from the fact that the operations of coinage were suspended several months in the year 1855, during the progress of the work- done at the Mint to render it fireproof, and to give additional security to the funds deposited in its vaults. The bullion then received hea beent coined during the last year. rho deposits and coinage at the brasch h-int atNew Orleans during theyear wereas follows :-Golddeposits, $310,935 67; silver deposits, $2668,803 02.

LONDON, TUE7SDAY, FpBBUARK 24, 1857.
In tho House of Lords last night,
The LOBD CHANCELLos, in consequence of an appeal from Lords LYxDHIURST and CA31rPxLL, postponed the second reading of the Divorce Bill till Tuesday, the 3d of March.
Lord POLivAiTIa moved forpapers connectedc .ith the discovery of certain guano islands on the coast of Arabia.
After considerable disautsion the motion Was agreed to.
The LoRD CHA.CELO5. then brought forward the Testamentary Bill, and, having recapitulated at great length the various points of the measure, moved that the Bill be read a second time.
Lord Sr. LEONAwD'S, after commenting on the ahiftinga and changes which the LORD CHANCEXOR had exlibited in the various Bills 1ahich. he had
brought forward on this subject, objected to the Ptesent meastue bectuse it virtually placed all the testamentary jurisdiction of the country in the hand3 of the Lord Chancellor. Why was the turden of this jurisdiction to be thrown in the first mistance on a Vice-Chancellor, when there existed a Judge of the Prerogative Court fully able and competent to discharge his duties? Again, he objected to the Bill, because it deprived the heir at law of Irghts which had accrued to him from time imme-
noriaL With regard to the question of compensation, he coutld have wished that the Bill had con-
tained more satisfactory informuation. In committee 'he should certainly move such alterations as seemed requisite to make the Bill more complete awd sucscessful.
Lord LmnDnuRsr meant to have spoken at length -against the Bill, but on looking round the House he found that there was just on.s-third of a peer to -each bench; and, as he did not care to address -empty benches, he should reserve his observations for a future occasion.
Lord CAMaPBErLL had the same disinclination, but, -as he was forced to be absent on circuit, he must apeak now, or not at all. There could be no doubt that a change was requisite in the testamentary jurisdiction ; the only question was how that change was to be effected. Ee must ccnfess he was not at al satisfied with the scheme of the LOUtD CHANCELLoR, wbich amounted to nothing more or less than this, that every contested vill cause was to be-come a Chancery suit. First of all the matter would come before a Vice-Chancellor, who would -direct an issue to be tried at common law; the -cause would then come back to him, and he would have to say whether he was satified with the verdict or not. From the decision there would be an appeal to the Lord Chancellor or the Lords Justices, ju& as there was with regard to a Chan-cery case, and afterwards there might be an appeal to that House. Now, were their Lordships of -opinion that such a machinery would effect any advantageous change if substituted for the present mlode of proceeding before a very learned judge in the Prerogative Court, with an appeal to the Judi-cial Committee of the Privy Council, whose judg'ment was tinal in the matter l The LORD C0HAxCELLOR shouild recollect that every one did not regard the Court of Chancery with such favourable eyes as he did; in fact, he should cbear in mind that great jealousy existed of t}at Court. Having -entered this protest against the Bill, he only hoped -that it would be referred to a select committee.
Lord WY-NFoRD here expressed his opinion that the stigma of Chancery would be fatal to the Bill.
Lord WENSLEYDARH said that he approved the principle of the Bill, but that be thought the -appointment of a Vice-Chancellor to preside over the Court a very doubtful advantage.
The LORD CIIANCELLOR then replied, remarking that many of the objections made to the Bill might -be sturmounted in committee.
The Bill wras then read a second time.
Some other business was then despatched, after ,which their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, in reply to questions -put by Mlr. ScoTr and Lord NAAs,
Mr. LABOUCHEZRE gave explanations respecting the -cession of the Kooria Mooria Islands, with their deposits of guano, adding that HIIE MAJESTY'S Government had acted in the matter oni the known and recognized principles of the prerogative of the CROwN.
The debate on going into a Committee of Ways and Means, adjourned on Friday, was resumed by
Mr. J.AMES M'GREGOR, who argued that if the House was satisfied with the scheme of finance proposed for 1857-58 the Income-tax must be perpetu;ated, which the country would not bear, and he insisted that the Budget did not rest upon a basis sufficiently firm.
Lord J. RussZLL said he thought it incumbent 'upon him, as a warm supporter of the Budget of 1853, to disprove the charges of Mr. GLADSTONE. In so doing he thought it right at once to say that -he concurred generally in the principles upon which the CHXNGELcOR of the EXCHEQuzER had founded his Budget. Into the details he was not bound to enter, but he reminded the House that the C1IANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER in the present year had to grapple with no ordinary difficulties. The ground taken by Mr. GLIADSTONE was, not that there was no great remission of taxes, but that there had been a departure from the policy of abolishing a vast number of smal
duties and simplifying the revenue. The principal merit of the Budget of Sir R. PEEL, Lord JOHN observed, was that it removed a great number of protective and differential duties, and asserted the just principles of free trade. Had the CHANCELLOR of the Exc'HEQUER departed from those principles? Had he, having been afreetrader all his life, inaugurated a new policy? Nothing of the kind. He (Lord JOHN-) did not agree with him as to the duties upon fire insurances and upon paper, holding that all these Excise duties were of a most injurious nature. 13e was desirous that the Income-tax should terminate inlbl iU; but he did not see that the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER had interposed any obstacle in the way; he should say that his proposals were not only not opposed to the Budget of 1853, but wvere specially calculated to carry that Budget into effect. At the same time he hoped, when the House was in Committee, the CHINCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER would adopt a different scale of tea duties, so as to mitigate the pressure tipon that article. With respect to the vote in the Committee of Supply, he thought the House could not call upon the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQuER-i to produce his estimate of the expendi-ture for 1858-59; at the same time it was a question fairly raised, and he could not but think, with reference to the expenditure of 1848, that some reduction of the Estimates was practicable, and that the House was entitled to call for a peace establishmnent. He was ready to go iuto Committee of Ways -and Means with the CMtNCELLOP. of the ExcHEQuER, and to allow that, keeping in view the policy and justice of putting an end to the Income-tax in 1860, he did not require a large concession of indirect duties in 1857.
Mr. BEN'TINCic was not prepared to support either the motion of the CHANCELLOB of the ExcHEQUER or the resolution of Mr. DISRtAELI. He could not -consent to vote money until he knew for what purpose, and be moved that the debate be adjourned, with the ulterior object of suspending the decision of the House until after its decision upon the Army, Navy, and Ordnance Estimates in a Committee of -Supply.
Mr. MIINES defended the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQt-ElR against the strictures of Mr. GLADSTONE, who, he thought, had been guilty of injustice.
Sir J. TYRELL, after some sarcastic allusions to the course taken by Mr. GLADSTONE, pronounced an eulogium upon Lord PALMIERSTON, to whom, he said, the country owed a deep debt of gratitude, and -declared he would join in no attempt to displace him. He should vote, he said, for the motion -of Mr. BExII?tc N¶.
Mr. WILKIN.SON likewise condemned the mode of proceedinjg adopted by MIr. GLADSTONE, who, he observed, had attacked the Estimates, which were not before the House. If the Estimates were passed, as being required by the exigencies of the -country, WVays and Means must be voted, either by direct or indirect taxation.
Mr. LIDDFL. acused Mr. GLADSTONE of inconsistency. alid reminded the House of certain circumstances connected with the Budget of 1853 which -detracted from its merits as a standard of comparison. Reforms, he remarked, were required in our arany and navy, for effecting which this was the moment; but they demanded money. He should, however, vote for the resolution of Mr. DISRAELI, because if the CHANCELLOR of the EX('1HEQUER was sincere in his calculation it aimed at the same re-
sult, and if the calculation was incorrect, its effect would be to induce the CHSANCELLOR of the EXCHEQuE1: to modify his plans.
Mr. J. PinLLutouxu was unable to understand what Mr. GLADSTONE really wished, as he bad not said a syllable upon that point. If his expressions, however, were equivocal, his purpose, he thought, was vlsar-namely, by -ujust and invidious repreZentaAons to briDg himself into power; but it -would, he said, require tenfold his ability, his confdence, and his experience to induce the country to follow so unsafe a guide and so unscrupulous a
partisan.
Mr. WHITESIDE thoug,ht the speech of Mr. siPrL.]xoRE came wvith an ill grace from him.
Sir F. BARING stated the reasons which induced lim to give his cordial support to the CHANCEILoR -of the FXCHEQUER[, and to vote against the resolution of Mr. DIstMI, who, in laying down the principles on which a future Budget should
be framed, had omitted, he observed, a matter of considerable importance-namely, what was to be done with the wair Income-tax. Without deciding this point it was impossible to frame a future financial arrangement. Mr. GzDsrooNs,he remarked, had not expressed himself dirstinctly upon this point. In the face of a threatened deficiency of 8,000,0001. or 9,000,0001., a financial Minister who had to meet these difficulties was, in his opinion, entitled to consideration and forbearance. After discussing the financial details stated in the course of the debate, he suggested that there was fair reason to suppose that the expenditure might be considerably diminished, so as to square with the revenue. But if he was wrnOg in this opinion, let the House first go into the estimates, and see what reductions could be made.
M,r. WALPOLE said he should confine himself to the distinct proposition before the House. He agreed in the main object which Lord J. RUSSELL appeared to have in view, and in most of the means by which he proposed to attain that object ; but it was hardly possible for him to conceive how Lord Jo. could arrive at his conclusion that the House ought to go into a Committee of Ways and Means before it had obtained the information which he seemed to think essential for his purpose. The ohject of the resolution was to abolish the Income-tax in 1860 by a wholesome reduction of the expenditure, and the first object of the Comnmittee of Ways and Means was to reimpose the Income-tax for 1858, 1859, and 1860, before the House knew what was to be the expenditure of those years. It was not only in the military and naval establishments that a reduction of expenditure ought to be looked for, but atil more in our civil departments. He was not for undue reductions; but when the fact was that our expenditure was now 10,000,0001. more than that required four years before the war commenced, it was impossible, he said, to deal with the subject properly unless the reasons of this expenditure were analyzed. He insisted strongly upon the binding obligation of the moral compact with the country regarding the Income-tax, urging that it was a matter which involved the honour of Parliament, and the injustice of reimposing the tax for 1858 before it was known what the expenditure in that year would be. He conceded that the practice was first to ascertain the amount of the expenditurc, and then to vote the Ways and Means ; but thi, rule was departed from when something unusual in our expenditure and revenue required the House to examine the general state of our whole finances; and this, he contended, was the case at present. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCBEQIER had declined to say that the remission of the Income-tax in 1860 was probable or possible, and these alarming words should induce the House to adopt the resolution. No Budget could be satisfactory to the country unless it secured the proper adjustment of revenue and expenditure, and the fulfiluent of a pledge solemnly given.
Mr. CARDWELL observed that the irresistible inference from the conflict of conclusions drawn from the same premises in the debate was that the motion was not well devised to bring out plainly and intelligibly the opinion of the House. Those who were determined to enforce economy should not vote for a dilatory motion, but should go into a Committee of Ways and Means, where, when asked to vote in time of peace duties which pressed apon the poorer classes of the community, the House might give effect totheirviewsof economy by refusing to impose those duties, replenishing the Exchequer without impoverishing the people. He should vote for going into committee.
Mr. GIBSON observed that, before the House could discuss the merits of Mr. DISRAELfS resolution, it must first pronounce an opinion upon the financial schenie of the Government. Those who were favourable to adding 4,000,0001. to the Army and Navy Estimates in excess of those for the year preceding the war, and to adoptingthe proposedduties, would vote for going into a Committee of Ways and Means; and those w,ho thought the Estimates too high, and wgho objected to the taxes in question, would voto against going into the Committee. He believed that if Parliament sanctioned the expenditure of the present year it would lay a foundation for a deficiency in future years and lead to the gradual subversion of the policy of 1842. He was for maintaining as part of the ordinary revenue of the country a fair and moderate Income-tax, believing it to be the keystone of a free commercial policy. If the House should be firm in rejecting this Budget he had no doubt that the Government would reconsider it and bring in one founded upon a reduced expenditure.
Mr. NEwDEOATE would not eonsent to vote the proposed duties for three years until he had had an opportunity of sifting the expendibure. He should support the motion for adjourning the debate.
Sir C. WOOD objected that the motion of Mr. DISRAELI, of an abstract resolution, stopping the House from discussing the Budget in committee, was a waste of time; and complained of the language which Mr. GLADsTo.NE had employed in the lecturehe had addressedtohis late colleagues. Hedenied that there had been any compaet or engagement on the subject of the Income-tax binding under altered circumstances. In such circumstances Parliament had to decide whether the tax should or should not be continued. He then reviewed the arguments of Mr. GLADSTONE, which he contrasted with his policy when in office, and explained and justified the financial calculations of the CHsANCExLLOR of the EXCHEQUER, who, he said, had acted upon the same principles as Mr. GLADSTONE in 1853, and who had nevertheless been attacked by him with acrimony and violence, and in terms hardly fit to be used by one gentleman to another. The charge againsttheGovernmentwas thepossibility of a deficiencyinl858-69,and what remedies were proposed ? The only proposition was Mr. W ALS'OLE'S, that, instead of imposing an Income-tax in 1858, it should be suffered to expire in 1857, in order to provide against a deficiency in 1858 ! With regard to the Estimates for the present year, he believed it not to be possible to reduce them further. He believed they would be smaller next year, but he would not pledge himself. The Government would do all they could, but he repudiated any contract or engagement.
Mr. GLADSTON\E, in explanation, disclaimed all intention to impute anything dishonourable to the CHASCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, or unbecoming his high character and position.
The CHANCELLOR of the ExcHEQuER, in a counter explanation, said that the language of Mr. GLADSTONE did convey to his mind very distinctly that he had laid before the House a statement that was deceptive, that statement being, on the contrary, perfectly correct.
The House first divided upon Mr. BENTTNcE's motion for an adjournment of the debate, which was negatived by 477 to 25.
A second division took place upon Mr. DIssRa's resolution, which was negatived by 286 to 206.
The House then went into a Committee of Ways and Means, but the Chairman was ordered to report progress.
The Commons Enclosure Bill passed through committee.
Other bills were advanced a stage, and, after some further business, the House adjourned at 1 o'clock.
In the great variety of criticism which a Budget
In the great variety of criticism which a Budget is certain to provoke Sir G. 0. IEw&s's has this testimony in its favour,-that it has raised up no rival. The boldest and best qualified critics have not done more than suggest a rather higher figure in one place and a rather lower one in another, and they have not ventu)red to offer a substitute. Mr. GLADSTONE has hidden his own ship in his own smoke, and, though the result is that his firing is 'wide of the mark, he has avoided the usual risks of war and lost nothing but powder and shot. Lord JOHN RUSSELL looks through the Budget with a calm, benignant eye, and observes, with characteristic nicety, that the twopence taken off the duty on tea will go into the pockets of the teadealers, whereas if threepence more were taken off the whole fivepence wor'i go into the pockets of their customers. He has the same to say about sugar, and in both cases we feel the question beyond our powers of measurement. In common with every other s?eaker from all sides of the House, Lord JoHN also looks with hope to the Estimates, and compares them with those wbich he had once himself to cut down. Every word, however, that is said for the possibility of reduction in this quarter is in the interest of the CIIAsNCLaO; of the ExOHEQMR, who not QmIp wants Parliaenta3y backing in. us
conflict with the departments, but actually rests his prospective plan, and consequently this year's Budget, on the feasibility of further reduction. Does he deny that the Estimates can be lowered ? On the contrary, he affirms it, and invites the House, by sanctioning his Budget, to pledge itself to economize so much as to dispense with the Income-tax in three years. Passing over some criticisms of a very general character, Mr. WHITESIDE has to explain that the CHAwcELIoR of the ExcHEQuER breaks faith with " a " particular trade " in Ireland, and also that Ireland did hope to see an end of the Income-tax. Mr. WVLoLE, with a good many others, thinks the maintenance of the Income-tax at the uniform sevenpence til 1860 rather ominous of its further continuance, and is very strong on the necessity of somebody or other keeping faith with sormebody else, by the cessation of the tax, whatever may happen. Mr. Al. GrssoN thinks that the Estimates are soine 4,000,0001. too high, and that a little pressure would bring them within a narrower compass. Such are some of the most important observations made on the Budget, which on Friday evening had to stand as terrible a fire as the mound at Woolwich. At this moment it cannot be said that any other scheme of taxation has been set up against it, or that if we had left Sir G. C. LEWIS we should have known whom to go to. With the exception of some sensible remarks on the Opposition side of the House, from Mfr. LIDDELL and Sir C. WOOD, everybody is open-mouthed for reduction. That is a course always open to the Parliamentary orator. It is a topic never out of season. There is a time for all things, but in the British House of Commons it is always the time to talk of retrenchrment, even though the talkers themselves are the very first to propose some novel application of the public money.
Under various disguises the real question before the House these two nights has been the Incometax, and it is remarkable how much imagmiation has been brought to bear on the merest questions of figures. Supposing that, as Mr. GIADSToNE did not openly propose, but necessarily implied, the War Ninepence had been retained for the year 1857-58, and his own reduced scale had been retained for the original Income-tax, in that case we should have had to pay 16d. for the next year and 5d. for each of the two succeeding years. For the three years together this would have amounted to 2s. 2d. in the pound, most unequally distributed, more than three-fifths of the burden falling on the first year, and the remaining two-fifths being divided between the two next. Such was Mr. GLADsTONE's proposal, unless, indeed, he should venture to disavow it. The CHANCELLOR of the ExomaQumens proposal is to raise ls. 9d. in the pound in the course of the three years, but distributing the burden equally between all three. For proposing to levy only Is. 9d. instead of 2s. 2d., and particularly for dividing the sum equally over three years, instead of levying three-fifths in the first year, one-fifth the second, and one-fifth the third, this unhappy gentleman has brought on his devoted head some of the most terrible abuse ever heard in the British Legislature. We do not remember any transgression, any breach of the moral, ceremonial, national, international, or constitutional law, that has been so heavily visited as this apparently harmless piece of financial adjustment. Out of the region of high finance one could not probably find a single man who did not think it a matter of plain common sense, to be settled by considerations of ordinary convenience. There might or might not be reasons for accumulating the burden on the first year. We might want ready money. It appears, indeed, that Mr. GL,Dsrox-s himself had left some little obligations to be met yearly till 1860, and there is some real cause for dividing this source of income between the three years. But, whatever the reasons, they were financial-not moral, nor even political, any more than the terms of a lease, or any other pecuniary arrangement. MIr. GLADSTONE, however, invested this little sum in division-this twenty one by three, this 7+7+7, instead of 16+5+5, with the blackest qualities,-with treachery, swindling, fraud, selfishness, and deliberate insolvency. No wonder he could not get a single member of the House to see the unfortunate figures through this distempered medium, though he stormed and raved at the figures as he would at the deeds of a Npro or the collause of a bubble bank; he had it all to himseif, for the House has refused to invest the harmless figures with the dark hues of crime.
Divested of rhetorical colours, of rival schemes, and of prospective Budgets, the problem is how to provide for the necessary expenditure, which of course itself has also to be ascertained. It is to the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, not the present, that we owe the present necessity for assuming a period of three years and subjecting it to a special financial treatment. The Oriental Monarch who invited all his Court to be happy for ten days suffered some rude and terrible interruptions, and retired to his palace in grief before the time was over. This has been the fate of Mr. GLA.DSTON'S promised term of financial prosperity, and his successor has had to construct a Budget, as weU as he could, out of its ruins. He has had to accommodate his plan to millions of reduction and other milions of liability. His arrangements for this purpose are of a very obvious and harmless description. But they are only secondary matters, and might have been discussed without a word of praise or blame. What is of first importance, and what the House of Commons will no doubt look to, is that our expenditure shal be no more than necessary, and our means sufficient. Now, it is not our place to say a word in favour of any duty whatever, but if the House of Commons desires to be rid of the Income-tax in 1860, it is vain to extort pledges from Chancellors of the Exchequer who may possibly not be then Chancellors of the Exchequer, or from Governments which may then be in the Opposition, or below the gangway. Such attempts only lay the foundation of false hopes, and give a pretence for ridiculous calumnies. The House of Commons is itself alone able to answer this question; it keeps the national purse; it restricts or
enlarges the expenditure. It can baffle the calculations of the most economical financier, and often has done so. Itself is to blame if the Income-tax should be necessary, or any other new tax necessary in its place, in 1860. So, as Mr. GLAi)STONE and Mr. DisRAELi have not had the success they desired, the latter gentleman's motion being lost by a considerable majority, all they can now doand it is the best service they can render to the State-is to apply their financial experience to tbe revision of every item in the Estimates open to that process.
It seems that the British people were premature
It seems that the British people were premature in thinking that they had heard the last of the Central American question. The Treaty conclud d last autumn between Lord CA> O and Mfr. DAuAS has been dealt with by the American Senate in a manner which is considered as tantamount to a rejection. It has been, by a majority of 33 to 8, referred back to the Committee upon Foreign Affairs, and the Ps-inSrDFNT is left without the authority of ratification. What the objections of the Senate are, and how far the alterations they desire may exteud, we are yet in ignorance, but it seems proWke- that the whole matter wiU
have to be discussed again in London, and that the British Government will be asked to yield to new or previously abandoned claims. As the Senate rejected the Treaty in what is caUed its executive session, and after a secret debate, we are obliged to take from common report the objections which prevailed. The two matters which were the cause or pretext of the Senate's dissatisfaction were, it is said, the Mosquito Protectorate and the Convention with Honduras with respect to the Bay Islands. The Treaty recognizes the Mosquito-Indians as forming an independent community, and defines the limit of their territory. They are to have the right of joining themselves to the Republic of Nicaragua on terms of equal citizenship. But the Senate objects that the Protectorate is not formally abolished. There is nothing, it is urged, to prevent England from virtually maintaining her power as in past times, and the exact delimitation of the territory gives a kind of guarantee to her claims. The majority in the Senate seems to be unwilling that a race which has received the support and owned the authority of England should be admitted to have a political existence. It has never been concealed by American politicians that their principle is to deny the possession of civil rights to all but men of pure European origin. The native Indian, the hiiported Negro, and the Half-castes which have sprung from the intercourse of the whites with these races are, through the action of a prejudice which has strengthened into a principle, debarred by American opinion from the exercise of free citizenship. When it is added that the Mosquitoes are supported in the enjoyment of sovereign rights by an European Power, and that Power England, we can readily conceive that a party, even in the highest American Assembly, should be anxious to defeat the pretension.
The objections to the Convention between this country and Honduras are analogous to the objections on the former subject. It is viewed with disfavour, as having been concluded without the interference and in anticipation of the action of the United States, and asprecluding the establishment of slavery in Ruatan and the other Bay islands. In the present state of the American mind with respect to slavery, any measure which tends to prohibit its introduction into the regions south of the States is looked upon with irrepressible anger by a large and, for the present, triumphant party. Not only the Southern slaveholder, but also the Northern Democrat, is touched to the quick by the news that a Republic of the weak and decaying Spanish race has thought fit to assent to the proviso that the " domestic institution" shall under no circumstances be introduced into a portion of its territory. And what is the Power which has importunately urged this condition ? England,-which is always interfering in the concerns of the American Continent, which is intent on introducing the infamous principle of " Free " Negroism" into the great Republic, and which, according to the MuxuRo doctrine, should not be allowed to engage the country in entangling alliances, much less to play the part of protectress to any set of Creoles, Indians or Negroes.
We have given the American reasons for rejection as they are likely to have occurred to the ardent opponents of the Treaty. The 33 Senators, however, probably made use of arguments which amount to little more than that England had obtained too favourable terms, and that the Treaty must consequently be rejected. Among the public at large there does not seem to exist any such fear. The Treaty of October was universaUy accepted as an honourable settlement of longvexed questions and a credit to the diplomacy of the present Cabinet. The rejection seems to have caused surprise in aU quarters. One newspaper expresses regret that questions already settled should be reopened, with the probability of renewed bitterness, and is afraid that a solution will be difficult, if America is to recommence the discussion with the reassertion of claims abandoned by her own representatives. Others, probably the majority, make light of the matter, and account for it as a political move. The relations between the two countries are, they say, to be hazarded to serve the ends of domestic party or individual ambition. These are not our accusations. We are only repeating what the newspaper press of aU shades of politics seems to concur in. In fact, the American public treats the whole thing as a matter of course. We are told every day by educated Americans that the shiftings and windings of their politics are past the comprehension even of their own citizens, and that everything is influenced by the party combinations of the moment. It is singular that while in England public opinion becomes stronger every day, and no set of politicians dare even to be suspected of postponing the national good to their own, yet in America, a Democratic Republic, the professional politicians have things entirely their own way, and enjoy a latitude of factiousness unknown in these islands. Whether it be that politics are faling into the hands of a lower class, or whether the extent of the country and the diversity of interests and character between the several States be the cause of the phenomenon, certain it is that an enlightened public opinion, all-powerful in the direction of national affairs, seems hardly to exist across the Atlantic. The old States cannot control the West, while South and North eschew each other and glory in having nothing in common. The New York press, therefore, takes the matter very philosophically. It acknowledges that the Treaty is a good one, that England has done her best to make an honourable settlement, and that there is really no ground for dissatisfaction or patriotic indignation. But it cannot be helped; the Washington people wish to keep the question open, to make political capital ; the incoming Government isjealous of the outgoing, and cannot let it have the credit of a pacific settlement ; and so the discussion must go on, and perhaps several months of wrangling with England will inaugurate the Presidency of MIr. BucnH"".
Now, the course of this country is perfectly clear. The negotiations which the British Government opened in the course of last year were honestly intended to put an end to differences
between two nations which a common origin and common interests should naturally unite. The convention with Honduras was concluded, not at our instigation, but in consequence of a special mission from that Republic. The Treaty with the United States was the work of an American Minister who had not long left his own country, and must have been acquainted with its feelings and interests. Our course reeeived the approbation of the American Government and of the American people. Yet it seems that a party in the Legislature does not hesitate to overthrow all that has been done, and to endanger the present friendly relations between the two countries. Our hands are therefore clean. The direct interest of England in the whole matter is very small. We care nothing about the Mosquito Protectorate; we do not want the Bay Islands; and our whole concern inHonduras is limited to a free transit across the territory, in case the contemplated railway should ever be constructed. The Americans have so little political connexion with any nation but England that a diplomatic campaign a,gainst us engrosses the attention and interest of the whole people. We, on the other hand, regard such differences as of secondary importance to the concees of European policy. Hence, in all these quesbans the American. peltician's aim is victory; th'Ll 'f the Englisunla, in to be disembarrassed of
a vexatious and often unintelligible controversy. In the present case we can very well afford to wait and see what are the precise objections of the American Senate, and what new demands Mr. DALLAS will have to make, after declaring himself satisfied with the settlement which was made four months ago.
When the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER made
When the CaAwcELLon of the ExcirEQuER made his Financial Statement the other day he aluded to a report on Fire Insurance Duties, as containing new and authentic information on this question, and as calculated to produce au effect upon the opinions hitherto entertained. The least we could do after such a recommendation was to give the document an early and attentive perusal, and the public shall now have the benefit of our pains.
Without expatiating on any historical statistics, we mnay briefly premise that since the year 1804 the stamp duty on a policy of Fire Insurance has stood unchanged at the sum of Is., and the percentage duty at 3s. for every 1001. of the sum insured since 1815. Now, considering that thie premium or payment required for the insurance itself amounts in cases of ordinary hazard to only Is. 6d. for every l001. insured, it follows that every man insuring his property on these terms, after paying the whole sum demanded by the office, pays just twice as much more in the shape of a tax to the Exchequer. As such a rate of taxation is, fortunately, very uncommon, and there is obviously nothing about the practice of Fire Insurance which should subject it, like dram-drinking, to any penal duties, people have called the justice of the impost in question, and have bestirred themselves in the matter, not, perhaps, with a view tothe unconditional or immediate abolition of the duty, but as establishing a pretty strong case for the consideration of this as well as other taxes when reductions or mitigations were rendered feasible by the state of the national finances. The CnANCELLOR of the ExCHEQUER, however, refuses even this moderate amount of assent on the point, and declares his conviction that " it is one of the last "duties which ought to be relinquished." If Sir CORNEWVALL LEwis has accepted without qualification all the conclusions of the report alluded to, we are not much surprised at the state of his opinions, for, certainly, according to the views given in this document, the tax is one of which all classes alike ought to be positively enamoured. It is very productive, and very improvirg; it costs little in collecting, and is inappreciable in its weight; in fact, as it is now imposed, there is, concludes the report, only one valid objection to it, and that is, that agricultural insurances, as well as all others, are not brought within its scope, instead of being uselessly exempted. The reader shall now receive a concise and impartial account of the results on which these extraordinary conclusions are based.
And, first, as to the rate of the duty. Doubtless, as Is. 6d. per cent. is found by experience to be a remunerative premium, an additional charge of 3s. per cent., in the shape of a Government duty, represents a tax of 200 per cent. on the article; but then it is not every species of property which can be insured at Is. 6d. in the 1001. The premium per cent. is 4s. on agricultural stock, 36s. on certain mercantile stocks, 3 guineas on property involving special risks, and generaly 5 guineas on theatres. Now, as the duty in every case remains the same, it follows that in all the more costly examples of insurance it bears a smaller proportion to the premium, until in the extreme instance of theatres its proportion to the premium, instead of being 200 per cent., is less than 3. This is what the CHAixcoionC of the ExCHEQuER meant when he observed, in commendation of the tax, that it " adapted itself with singular " felicity to the circumstances of the taxpayer," being " heaviest when the insurance was lightest, " and lightest when the insurance was heaviest." However, on a point like this the only way, of course, is to strike an average, and the report admits that altogether the duty and premium, taking one case with another, are just about equal -that is to say, that the tax on the article, though not 200 per cent., is cent. per cent. beyond a doubt. So much for its rate.
This point being disposed of, there follows next in order the well-known consideration derived from the moral bearing of the impost in question as a tax upon prudence, nor does the report deny that, as the act of insuring is a prudent one, the tax upon it must, according to its amount, be an obstacle to prudence. Per contra, however, it is argued that most taxes have pretty much the same characteristic, inasmuch as it is in their very nature to be derived from all those meritorious faculties, prudence included, which are productive of wealth. How is property-the object of Fire Insurance-realized by its owner ? By industry, enterprise, thrift, and self-denial; and at every step of the process in which these faculties are engaged taxation comes in so severely that the result is but imperceptibly affected by the addition of the triflng duty ultimately paid to assure the safety of the realized whole. Again, though insurance against fire is certainly an act of prudence, the prudence is not, publicly considered, of that kind which conduces to the general wealth. It does not preserve any portion of the general property from destruction; it merely keeps an individual harmless at a proportionate expense to a common ftnmd. Indeed, it is intimated that from this point of view the system of Fire Insurance may bave been even detrimental, in so far as the opportunities thus opened to fraud may have suggested the wilful destruction of property by fire.
Apart from these two special points, certain others may be considered common to this tax among the rest; such as its operation in discouraging the act or process taxed; its burden upon trade or production; and the probabilities discernible of any increase or maintenance of the revenue to follow upon a modification of the duty. On al these points the report pronounces for the status quo. The calculation is made that in the year 1855 the total value of insurable property in England and Wales (omitting the agricultural property as exempted) was not much above 874,000,0001., and since the property actuaUy insured and paying duty amounted to 785,000,0001., while a good deal of property is made to insure itself, and some is in such hands that it would never, under any circumstances, be insured at all, it is computed as a fair approximation to truth that insurance had pretty well reached its limits; that on the ono hand there would be no great discouragement operating against prudence, and on the other not much room for any such expansion as would maintain the productiveness of the tax at a modified rate of
duty. It is urged, moreover, that whereas agricultural property for 22 years has been exempted from duty, the increase of insurances at first discoverable herein has gradualy declined, while a constant, and of late a rapid, augmentation hasbeen maintained in the case of property not favoured with the exemption. There is the case for Fire Insurance Duties fairly stated, and now, Sir C. LEwis will ask, what can we say on the other side. He shaU hear.
First, if this tax is so convenient, so self-adjusting, and so insensible in its operation, whence comes aU the complaint about it, and how is it that the expression of his views the other night was received with so much dissent ? It is precisely the old story of the pinching shoe. He was "s orry "tn differ from hon. gentlemen,"-he assured them that the leather wa4 aoft aad pliableo
the size exact, and the fit exceUent ; but his customers writhed uneasily all the same, and no wonder. When a man fiuds that he can insure 5001. worth of property for 15s. a-year, but that; the tax levied upon the precaution is 15s. more, he naturally grumbles at such a rate of assessment; nor is he in the least degree likely to be appeased by hearing that the proportion cannot exceed 3G10Oths of a penny on each pound sterling of value. It is not only the actual amount of a tax, but its rate and its character, wbich men consider. Look at local taxation, and see what would be thought of an extra rate of 15s. a-year laid upon propertyworth 5001. Look at abridge, andseewhat; is thought of a penny toll. Very likely the duty on Fire Insurance is small compared with others, but as long as it is seen to amount to as much as the whole cost of the insurance itself its proportions will infaUibly create discontent.
Take, again, the other great point involvedthe nature of the act subjected to this heavy taxation. We think the natural deduction from the arguments of the report would be, not that the duty is unusually light, but that it is unusually severe. If property is indeed the result of prudence, and if this prudence has already been sharply taxed at every successive stage of its exertions, it might surely plead for some exemption when its object had been at last obtained. If a man has been taxed at every step of his toil, and has, nevertheless, in spite of this taxation, realized a little bit of property, it seems to us the strangest of all arguments to urge that, considering the impediments previously placed in his way, he cannot reasonably object to some obstacle being interposed when he wishes to secure his savings. The truth is, that the duty is felt as a tax of a. very large relative amount on an act 'which is certainly one of prudence, and the feeling it creates is nothing but natural. Nor does it derive much support from being considered as a piece of direct taxation. If realized property ought to be taxed, tax it; but this is a tax, not upon all property, but only upon property which is insured. Negligent or imprudent; owMners may escape it altogether, and very large proprietors may elude it by becoming their own insurers. What would be thought of a horse-tax which -was laid, not upon horses, but upon the locks of stable doors? l'hy, moreover, if the duty is only a form of direct taxation, should it be levied. upon property, such as house property, which. has already paid its own duty of this very kind ? We are very well aware that there is no tax which is not more or less hurtful, and against which more or less case cannot be made out. We are aware, too, that we must needs raise a large revenue from items partaking of this objectionable quality; but when the duty on Fire Insurance is exhibited to us as a piece of positive exceUence, and speciaUy recommended for admiration and preservation, we feel bound to protest against the assumption, and the conclusion too.

(BX ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.)
An inquest was held upon the body at the Harewood. Arms, Harewood, yesterday (Mlonday), before MIr. T. Taylor, coroner, and a respectable jury.
From the evidence it appeared that Lord Harewood, when the accident occurred, was riding a favourite old. maro hunter, and not a young horse, as has been reported, and was attempting to " brush" through a young thorn hedge, when the animal stumbled over a sheep net at the other side, and threw the noble lord over her head, and. it is supposed that he was struck by the mare with her fore feet while pawing to relieve herself.
The medical attendant stated that death had resulted. from erysipelas in the head.
A verdict of " Accidental death" was returned.
The remains of the noble lord will be interred in the family vault at Harewood Church on Saturday morning next, at U o'clock.

TmE BITrrsx EMNBASSY AT CONSTANTINOPLE.-Mr. Charles Alison, Oriental Secretary to Her hIajesty's Em bassy at Constantinople, has been appointed Secretary of Embassv to the same miesion, in the place of Lord Napier, lately named Minister to the United States. Mr. Alison bas been nearly 20 years in the diplomatic service. In 1S44 be was sent by the British Government, with the concurrence of the other great Powers, to Lebanon, to sette; the question of "nixed villages," and so successful was his mission in establishing peace among the Druses and Maronites that shortly after his return to Constantinople he was promoted to the rank of Oriental Secretary. A short time after Mr. Alison was sent by Lord Stratford de Reddliffe to Boudroon, the ancient Hshcarnassus, to remove the remains of the celebrated Mausolenni, which his Lordship had discovered were to bo found in the neighbourhood of that town, and was equally successful. MIr. Alison is a profound. Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and Greek scholar, and has been long known to the Foreign-office as an able diplomatist. He owes his advancement entir,ly to his own merits, which is the more remarkable in a profession which has been looked on as the exclusive property of the aristocracy. It is thought that the Hon. Percy Smythe will succeed Mr. Alison as Oriental Secretary.

(FROM OUR OWh- e M N
PARIS, SUiNDAY, FEB. 22, 6 P.a. | I have received the following letter from Naples, dated the 12th inst.:-
"Domiciliary visits continue. After the visit of the police to Filanghieri, to IschiteUa, ex-Minister of War, and dther f unctionaries attached to the Governmeut by years of 8delity, three or four days ago M. Espagnolis, the CommisFary of Police, visited the house where the nephews of Gene. ral Licca reside, and then presented himself at the residence of the ex- Minister of Police, Delcaretto. I do not mention the numerous visits paid to the houses of simple citizens, especialUy those of the legal profession, who are especially suspected of being hostile to the King. But the visit which has produced the greatest astonishment in public is that paid to the Prince de C-, whose attachment to the Bourbons had never before been caUed in question. The reason is the following:-The Prince has, it appears, a housekeeper, who has lived with him for a long time. The housekeeper had a child who is now about 16 or 17 years of age, and who is supposed, rightly or wrongly, to be the nataral son of 'the Prince. Antonio Salvi, the lad in question, had been recommended by the Prince to the superintendent of the Royal stables, and, as he was an admirable horseman as well as a remarkably handsome youth, ho employed him as an outrider. It appears that one day Antonio was in the stables at Caserta, and, thinking that no one else wastpresent, he took a piece of amadeu, or prepared tinder, and rubbed it against the wall in order to light his cigar. At tbe slight crackling noise it made the servant who was on guard at the stable door entered, and seeing a sort of match which is not much used here, as weU as the embarrassment of the youth, as the lighting a match is an infraction of the regulations, he at once concluded that Antonio Salvi intended to set fire to the building. At the cry of the servant the other attendants ran up. Antonio was laid hold of and at once considered and treated as a Mazzinian of the worst class. Ie vwas beaten, and had his clothes torn, and was then dragged off to the Commissary of Police, who began his examination by boxing him on the face and nearly knocking him down. He told the truth of the affair, and showed the cigar, which he still held in his handl He was asked where he had got the prepared tinder; h a replied that be had got a piece from one of the grooms of the Count d'Aguilar, the King's brother. The groom was at once sent for, and interrogated in his turn. This unfortunate man, seeing the importance attached to such a trifle, and frightened at the danger to himself, denied that he had ever given any to Antonio. The consequence was that the youth was at once set down as an incendiary. He was sent forthwith to Naples, thrown into the horrible charnel-house of the Santa Maria Apparente, and put to the torture. His mother heard of the affair, and the Prince de 0- lost no time in making inquiry about it and in trying to get the unfortunate young maan out of the scrape. Instead of rendering him assistance the house of the Prince himself was visited, on the suspicion that he also was an accomplice. In the meantime Antonio was beaten with a nerf de bweuf, and his body presented one huge wound. This horrible punishment could not wring from him any other avowal than the one he had already given, and he is incapable of inventing any. Of course the object is to ascertain if he has accomplices. The magistrates, even if there be any yet among them who remain uncorrapted, will not dare to act according to their consciences, and they will be obliged to condemn him, A proof of this may be seen in the affair of the Majorat of the Prince de Campana Samnbieze, which amoants to 600,000 ducats. This heritage of the sons of the Duke of Malisto. Sambieze is disputed by the Messanelli family, much favoured by and very faithful to the Court. The sons of the Duke have for their advisers the three best members of the Neapolitan bar, Stavace, Minesvini, and Vignoli (exMinister of 1848). It is said that some of the judges do not conceal the fact of the heirs of Malisto having right on their side, but as among the heirs to the property is the Dike de San Donato Saiiibieze, one of the three or four members of the high aristocracy of Naples who joined the revolution and fought on the 15th May-wlho is now in exile, and who has written an admirable pamnphlet on the actual condition of the Two Sicilies,-the Court leaves nothing undone to induce the judges to decide against him, and on behalf of the favourites of the King.
" The King is stiUl at Caserta, and lives more secludeE than ever. He is afraid of his own brothers, but above all of his son, the heir to his crown. The ramour of an approaching change is stiU current at the Court. People, however, no longer talk of abdication, but it is affirmed positively that the King will make some concessions to the Western Powers, and wiUl then make a journey somewhere 'with the Queen and his famlly. His eldest son wiUl act as Lieutenant-GenerLl of the Kingdom in his absence (others say the Prince Luigi), not as an altcr ego, but with instructions very precise and detailed, and, to assist him, men who wil not only be his advisers but spies on him. Ferdinand cannot make up his mind to lay aside the crown at the age of 47, although that crown is really one of thorns.
"Some short time since an advocate named Raffaele Caterina, the father of a famnily, happened to be readin; the Civila Cateolica, a religious journal, which is edited by the Jesuits. The police were informed of the fact. A Commissary presented himself at his house, and said, 'You like, then, to read the papers, do you?' ' Yes-the Civilta Cttolica.' 'No matter; it is stiUl a newspaper. WeU then, since you like that sort of reading-siace you like the Civilta CaUolica-the Giendarmes will conduct you to the frontier, and you may go to Rome to read it.' Di. Caterina preferred going to read something else in Piedmont. "
A letter dated Turin the 20th inst. announces that a deputation of citizens of Modena and Reggio had the previous day presented Count Cavour with a medallion from their fellow-citizens. On one of its faces is stamped the effigy of the President of the Council, round which is inscribed "To Count Camille de Cavour, Modena and Reggio," and on the other a group of allegorical figures, representing the towns of Modena and Reggio, to which Piedmont, armed, is extending her hand. and under which are the words " Quocl Dews cornrnxit hosw wno separet." The followving address accompanied the medallion:-
" Excellency,-We offer your Excellency, on the part of our fellow-citizens of Modena and Reggio, this feeble tribute of gratitude for the truly dignified manner in which your Excellency supported the unfortunate populations of Italy In the Congress of Paris. The citizens of Modena and lleggio consider Piedmont, its King, and its governors, as the paUadium of their common country, and they have not forgotten that memorable period of 1848, when, by unani. mous vowvs, tnoy united with Piedmont by bonds, which force may burst for the present, but which faith preserves in aU their vigour."
The Pays, the Ministerial paper, states that the fact of a convention for the cession of territory lately made by the Persian to the Russian Government is incontestable, but whether it extends to the frontiers of Turkish Armenia is uncertain. The Pays adds that such a convention is in the very nature of thin'gs. According to the terms of the ancient treaties existing between Russia, Feth All Shah, and Mehemed Shah, Ruissia engaged to defend with arms the kingdom of Persia in case its territory should be invaded. At the commencement of the existing differences with Great Britain the Shah claimred from Russia the benefit of those treaties and the latter hastened to follow up acts with words by sending an army, which is at present assembled on the Araxes. The presence of these troops did not stop the expedition to Btishire, but it prevented the English from advancing to Cabul or Candahar, and from invading Khorassan.
The French Government has appointed two consuls to Persia, one to Tauris, and another who is to reside at Shiraz during the time Bushire is occipied by the British troops.
A letter from Trieste announces that the Austrian Government has placed on the stocks at Pola, its principal dockyard, a screw frigate on a new
model, which is to be called after the date of the decree published by the Emperor of Austria grant. ing an amnesty to the political prisoners in Lombardy. The Emperor himself desired that this act of clemency should be consecrated in this manner.
The Armenians who inhabit the Ottoman empire, and who form a community of about 3,000,000 people, have resolved to appoint a special agent at London and Paris to protect their interests. Their choice has fallen on a mnember of the family Duz, one of the most influential Armenian families throughout the East.
There was a long conference yesterday at the Foreign-office between Count Walewski, Dr. Kern, and M. de Hatzfeldt, the P,rssian Minuster, on the affairs of Switzerland.

VIENNA, FkB. 19.
Their Majesties intend to leave Eilan on Mrch 5, and to be back in Vienna on or about the 15th of the same month. To-day, the 19th of February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs quits the capital of Lombardy, and returns to this city by way of Venice after having paid short visits to the Courts of Parmia and Modena. The question at isue between His
Majesty the Emperor and the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian has been settled to the entire satisfaction of both parties. The future GovernorGeneral of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom 'will not only hold extremely full powers, bat he will be dependent on His Majesty alone. The Archduke will be allowed to make his propositions directly to the Emperor, instead of sending them to the Ministers, as Marshal Radetzky has always been obliged to do. It is not yet known what arrangement has been madce respecting the military government of the kingdom, but it is believed that the military Adlatus will receive his instructions, through the Governor-General, from the Central MKIilitary Chancellerie of the Emperor. The public is somewhat at a loss to comprehend why the Archduke Ferdinand MIaximilian should so strongly insist on having his military Adlatus made directly subordinate to him, bat those personF who are aware of what passed in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom before the year 1848 can perfectly well understand his motives. The late Archduke Reignier, the Viceroy of the LombardoVenetian kingdom, was nominally at the head of the A dministration of the country, but he was dependent on the chief of the Home Department in civil matters, and had little or no infuence on Count Radetzky, who was allowed to manage the military affairs of the kingdom almost as he pleased. The private intelligence received from Milan is not as favourable as could be wished. Several of the highest familiesfrequentlyappear at Court, butthegreat mass of the "noWli" still keep aloof. It wasoriginaUythe intention of their Majesties to give several grand balls during the carnival, but the idea was relinquished, because it was feared that the spacious State apartments might be il fiUed. The military party in the Lombardo-Veuetian kingdom, which is by no means pleased with the concessions made by the Emperor to his Italian subjects, foretells that evil consequences wiU arise from " all these" innovations, an people here are so malicious as to insinuate that it would not be sorry to see its predictions fuliUed. The Detutsche AUgemeiue Zeitung has learnt from Vienna that Baron Bach is about to undertake a journey to Rome, " to endeavour to persuade the Papal Government to consent to a modification of certain stipulations of the concordat ;" but the news is certainly apocryphal. The :inister of the Interior rendered the Papal Nuncio all possible assistance when he was negotiating for the concordat, and he is not likely to try to undo the work of his own hands. Baron Bach has recently become extremely devout, and, if he does go to Rome, it will doubtless be in order to obtain the blessing of His Holiness. The Eternal City is at present crowded to excess, and it has been observed that very many of the visitors are Neapolitans.
SPAIN.
(FROM OUR OWN ConREsPONDZNr.)
MADRID, FEB. 17.
Several hidden stores of arms and ammunition, some of them considerable in quantity, have recently been discovered in this capital. They are believed to have been formeed by the Democratic party, which there can be little doubt is conspiring with the cognizance, if not with the co-operation, of the Progresistas. There is at present no chance of success for an armed attempt against the established order of things, and it would be a pity if any were made. I do not believe that the Progresista party, properly so called, would be likely to join in an insurrection, but it is now divided into numerous shades, and some of its more exaltado members might be disposed to risk a despsrate effort. The main body of the party, much disheartened and lacking organization, contents itself with watching the course of events. At present it has no declared leader, but Senor Olozaga is the president of its committee, and the man of most mark in its ranks. Few of its members-none, indeed, but a few personal and partial friends-now look with any hope to Espartero, whose political career is justly considered as terminated, and whose name is never heard. He will be remembered as the successful general who brought to a close a ruinous civil war, but those who most esteeni him will, if wise, draw a veil over a political life marked by incapacity and irresolution. His honesty and good intentions none have ever questioned. The party of which he was lately the ehief has resolved to take part in the approaching elections, not with the hope of proving vietorious in them, or even of sending to the Cortes an important minority, but because they consider that by standing aloof fewerproofs would be obtained of the illegality with which it is confidently expected they will be conducted. Of such illegal practices abundant exampleswere witnessed in the recent municipal elections. Printed lists of the voters were published, but in numerous instances it happened that when persons included in them presented themselves their votes were refused by the official ap pointedto receive them. AU these officials were supplied with private lists, differing from the printed ones, to guide them as to acceptance or rejection. Thus, when M. Olozaga presented himself to vote he was not allowed to do so. His right was so notorious, and the refusal so scandalously illegal, that the functionary, after reference to his private list, stil hesitated, and would fain have hit upon some middle course. But Senor Olozaga insisted on' his vote being either taken or refused, and ref used it was.
Meanwhile the party in power are, as usual, filling their pockets and gratifying their friends. WVe hear of large sums allotted to Ministers for expenses of establishments and receptions. Promotion in the army, checked during the Espartero-O'Donnell Government by a decree declaring that no officer should be advanced until three vacancies had occurred, is no longer restrained by that wholesome rule. Only the other day the numerous promotions given by the Polacos between the insurrection of O'DonneU and the insurrection in Madrid in July, !1854, and which had been annuled, were declared I valid. There are now between 500 and 600 generals
in the Spanish army, from brigadier to field-marI shal. The great load on the Treasury is the | payment of the countless unemployed civil
and military officials, and this load continually increases. One scarcely meets a person of the middle or upper classes who is not in receipt of a pension or retiring allowance of greater or less Iarmount; and the great majority of them if deprived of this would starve, for they-have been brought up to no trade or profession, and are as unable as they are unwilling to earn their living by the exertion of their head or hands. This is the country of enormous selfishness, and where patriotism is but a name. Half the revolutions at least that have been witnessed here have arisen from the desire of those who were on half-pay to get full pay-of those who had something to obtain more. No party is exempt from this reproach. Nothing could be more disgusting than the rush for places and rewards witnessed when the Progresistas came into power in 1854. Even Espartero, then so popular, and himself so disinterested, had not power to check the ignoble scramble, and was fain to yield and to give much that ought to have been withheld. He endeavoured in some degree to atone for this by great self-abnegation, and by introducing bis owIn probity into the various administrations of the State. It would be hard to prove that any Minister who served with him left office the richer for having held it. Inbhis time there were no extravagant allowances to enable Ministers to give
snabby weekly tea parties, nor did he allot to hi m- self large sums for expenses of installation aud establishment. It is a most unfortunate thing for Spain that his Government proved itself so much less able than honest, and that the country should consequently have fallen into the hands of a clique to whose selfishness and corruption there are no known limits.
The newspapers contain further details of the outrages committed in Mexico upon the Spanish residents, and cite numerous murders, houses sacked, and barbarous cruelties, of which the troops of Alvarez have rendered themselves guilty. Instances are mentioned in which these atrocities took place within cannonshot of the troops of President Comonfort, without their interfering to check them. The Dxim-o Es.panol estimates the Spaniards established in Mexico at more than 20,000, representing a capital of nearly $150,000,000, and engaged prominently in all the great industrial undertakings of the country-in mining, agriculture, trade, and banking.
The Espana announces that as soon as the ships can be got ready a bodyof troops will be embarked for Cuba, to replace those which are to be sent from that island against Mexico. Several generals are to accompany them.

Monday Evesing.
NIotice has been given to-day that the Exchequerbills dated in March, 1856, must be sent in on or before the 9th of next month to be paid off, or for renewal. Tho terms of renewal will be at the existing rate of 2kd. per day, or 31. 16s. (ld. per annum.
The English funds opened this morning at the closing prices of Saturday, and, with the exception of a slight tendency to improvement towards the termination of business, remained inactive throughout the day. Consols for money were first quoted 9oa to i, and the final trausactions were at 931 for money and 93k for the 5th of March. The next account is fixed for the 8th of April, and the quotation for that period was 94g. The announcement of the arrival of the Ocean Chief with 288,0001. of Australian gold, and of the Blackwall and the Electra being on their way with 380,0001., was calculated, together with the improvement on the French Bourse, to create animation; but business was limited, and the market generally showed no buoyancy. Money was in fair supply for loans on Government securities at a. per cent. Bank Stock left off at 218 to 220; Reduced, 94; Nevw Three per Cents., 94i; India Stock, 219 to 222; Eachequer-bonds, 98k to I ; India Bonds, 2s. dis. to Is. pm.; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. pm.
Foreign securities have not experienced any great variation, but prices were scarcely so well supported at the close. In Turkish Six per Cents. the operations for account were at 95k and g; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, at 101 and 1. Theotherbusinesscomprisedl-Mexican Three per Cents., 22i; Peruvian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., for account, 80i and A; Portuguese Three per Cents., for account, 44a and X; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 981t; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 401; and the Certificates were firmer at 61, i, and i per cent.
The corn-market was dull this morning, and sales could not have been pressed, except at a further declne.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. lOc. for money and 70f. 35c. for the end of the month, showing a further improvement of nearly three-eighths per cent. The recoverywithin the past fortnight has been equal to 21 per cent.
The private letters from Paris describe a strong revival of speculative feeling. The transactions on the Bourse have been extremely large and numerous, andthere seems a general disposition to believe
in the approach of another period of inflation. Money is obtainable without difficulty at from 5i to i per cent. A reduction in the rate of discount of the Bank of Frankfort from 5 to 4 per cent. had just been reported, and a downward movement was also expected at Amsterdam. The French Government were alleged to be on the point of making some new railway concessions.
All the continental exchanges continue with a favourable appearance. In each of the principal cities also the rate of discount is below the rinimum in London. At Hamburg, Frankfort, and Brussels it is 4 per cent., at Amsterdam it is 5 per cent., and at Paris 51 per cent.
The failure of Messrs. C. Fran hiadi and Sons has been followed by that of two other Greek firmsnamely, Messrs. Vuros, Brothers (lately Schilizzi and Vuros), and Messrs. P. Sinanides and Co. The liabilities are not supposed in either case to be very heavy. The Manchester letters mention the suspension of Mr. J. Basilio, also a Greek merchant.
The intelligence from Australia by the Ocean Chief is 18 days later than that by the Morning Light. The greater part of the gold by this arrival will probably be sent to the Continent, but some of the other supplies which are expected will probably remain here.
The specie from New York to-day by the Arabia is 40,0001., remitted to Messrs. Rothschild on French account. The commercial advices on this occasion describe a large extent of business in the stock-market without any average change in quotations. Some descriptions of railway securities had improved, but others had declined, in consequence of rumoured damage from heavy floods. Erie was quoted 60; Reading, 80 to J; New York Central, 91 to i; and Panama, 94 to J. Ilinois Central had touched 140i, but had gone back to 137. The repudiated bonds of California stood at 67. Ohio and Mississippi 1st mortgage bonds could be realized, it was believed, at about 80 to 85. The rate of exchange was becoming rather more favourable for this country, in consequence of the spring importations of manufactured goods.
A memorial from the principal houses in the trade with Singapore was presented to-day to the President of the Board of Control against an Act contemplated by the Legislative Council of India for levying tonnage dues at that port. It would reverse the policy under which the settlement was founded, and damage a trade which by the last returns was equal to 10,000,0001. sterling; yet the utmost sum that it could realize would be about 8001.
The trade of the manufacturing towns during the past week exhibited no alteration. At Manchester the progress of business would be satisfactory but for the uncertainty caused by the high price of cotton. At Birmingham the iron-market is well sustained, and there is fair employment in aU the other manufactures of the town. The Nottingham report describes continued animation both in hosiery and lace. In the woollen districts there has been increased activity at firm prices, and in the Irish linen-markets the tendency has been towards a decline.
The general business of the port of London durinq the past week was small. The number of vessels reported inwards was 81, being 47 less than in the previous week; and the number cleared outward was 93, including 10 in ballast, showing a decrease of 13.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the week have comprised seven vessels,-three to Sydney, three to Port Phillp, and one to Adelaide,-with an aggregate capacity of 4,493 tons. The rates of freight continue to exhibit a heavy appearance.
The following is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders:-
" The committee have received advices from Mr. White. head, dated Mexico, the 19th nlt., from which they learn, with great regret, that Mr. Lerdo's resignation had on the 3d ult. been definitively accepted by the President, and on the 5th had been made public. No one has yet been named to succeed him. The President had, however, signified to Mr. Whitehead that effect would be given to the arrangement negotiated with Mr. Lerdo, of which the committee expect to hear further by the direct packet due next week, With the exception of some small amounts received in Mazatlan and Colima, and $4,598 which hr. Whitehead bimself had in hand, he feared that no remittances were likely to come forward just at present, in consequence of several recent aggravations of the political condition of the country.',
A very able report from Captain Galton to the Board of Trade on the railways of the IUnited States has just been printed. It describes their geographical peculiarities, the legislation to vwhich they have been subjected, and their modes of constitution, construction, and management. It shows that while they have been characterized by great defects they have upon the whole accomplished in a remarkable manner the object of opening up an unsettled country with rapidity and economy, and also that they present many features that might be advantageously adopted on this side. The Illinois Central Railway, which was assisted by a grant of 2,595,000 acres of land by the Federal Government, is quoted as exemplifying a system that might be introducedo int
our colonmes, and especally for the construction of a
line through Canada to the Pacific. The selection of a routefrom the easternStatesof theUniontoCaliforia is at present an all-absorbing question among the railway projectors of America; and the estimate of the most favourable line-namely, that from Fulton to San Pedro, near the parallel of 32 deg.-gives the length as 1,618 miles, the summit level 5,717 feet
the proportion of arable land 45 per cent., and the cost 17,000,0001. The greatest drawback to the cheapness of American railways is the duty of 30 per cent. upon iron. This has led to the use of the lighteat possible description of rails. With regard to the rails obtainedfrom England, andpaid for bymortgage bonds, Captain Galton observes that they are generally stated not to have proved durable. This result
was fully to have been anticipated, and it is from such transactions that some of the worst descriptions of American railway securities have been foisted upon ignorant persons in this country, agents being bribed to dispose of them by the allowance of a
large discount. To professional people the report will furnish a number of auggestious for modifications in the construction of rolling stock, &C.
Those w hich concern the onven e of the general public are also numerous. At ome stations in America where the passenger traffic is large the booking-office has a second opening into the ladis
vWrti-o_om - 9so thaf lidies traeUlling aIone can obtaii tickets without crowd or difficulty. On lines where -the jouiney occupies a considerable time "some of the cars are fitted with compartments about the size of our firt-class carriage cornp.%rtments, in which the seats are arranged for the backs to turn iup, and so as to form two tiers of berths or sofas for the accommodation of p%3sengers who may wish to lie down." For these an extra price is charged. The luggage arrangements prevent all possibility of loss. Brass checks are given (those issued from each station having a distinct series of numbers), and persons desirous of having their baggage forwarded to any hotel or other addre3s have nothing to do but to give their check to an agent appointed for the purpose, who will cause it to be promptly delivered for a very small charge. The baggage is given up to whoever produces the check, and the owner can, if ie thinks fit, leave it for several days without claiming it. If a check is lost the passenger is required to pay a small sum to replace it. An arrangement for affording protection to the engine-drivers and firemen against inclement weather contributes to the safety of the passengers. The footplate of the engine is covered by a roof supported by glazed sides and a glazed font, and the men, being much more comfortable, are enabled to keep a far better look-out than when unprotected. The difficulty of effecting a communication between passengers and the guard has never been recognized in America. A cord with several hooks passes through every car, and it is the duty of the conductor to see that the communication between each car is complete before a train starts. The greater extent of the carriages, which are from 40 to 60 feet in length, and consequently the fewer connexions to be made, favour this arrangement. It also facilitates the passage of the guard from one carriage to another, and allows a compartment to be appropriated for ladies, saves time and cost, and enables stoves to be introduced in winter. In the summer iced water is placed in coolers for the use of the passengers. These are among the principal points that may operate as useful suggestions. On the other hand, the defects of system consequent upon general cheapness of construction, and the difficulty of controllingeither passengers or servants, areveryserious. The accommodation at the stations is generally inadequate, the conductors issue and collect tickets without any check, the result being great peculation, and some companies suit their own convenience in altering or suspending the departure of trains, and refuse to issue time-tables, on the ground that it might render them liable to actions in cases of unpunctuality. In the older States the speed is not very different from that upon English railways. In the west it is generally limited to about 20 to 24 miles per hour. The cost of the lines in the States of New York and Massachusetts has averaged 11,3901. per mile, while that of the western lines, hastily constructed, with little regard to durability, has been between 7,0001. and 8,000l. In the latter case a considerable additional expenditure would be required to bring them up to a state of permanent efficiency. From this experience in a country where every effort of uncontrolled and inventive vigour has been made to attain cheapness the total inadequacy of the Russian offer of 14,8501. per mile may be demonstrated. If the railway works of America had been liable to interference from Government officials even at Washington, it is probable the New York outlay, instead of bein- 11 3901. per mile, would have been 20,0001. VIThat, then, is to be expected in the interior of a country totally unknown to the persons whosemoney is to be expended, and governed by functionaries whose sole duty is to impose restraints and obstructions? In relation to the returns from railwav investments in America it is observed, "The proportion which the profits bear to the capital invested is between 5 and 6 per cent. in New York and Massachusetts, and more in the western States, as compared with 3i per cent. on British railways. But it mnst be borne in mind that the ordinary rate of interest in the United States on the best securities is as much as 6, 7, or 8 per cent., and that, consequently, the profits on railways in the eastern States do not bear avery different ratio to the ordinary rate of interest than is the case in this country."

6ir,-In TZe nimeRs of the 20th inst. you reported a sad acciderst which occurred to a poor woman, Martha Watts, tbe wife of a "pointsmau" on the Windsor line near Barnes, who, in the endeavour to save her child, was ierself thrown down by the train, which, passing over her, seriously iujured herchest and head, and crushed both her legs. She was conveyed to St. Thomas's Hospital, where bbth legs wvre immediately amputated.
Lady Willock, of Castlenau-house, Mortlake, has very kinsdly consented to receive subscriptions for this poor vwom,nu and her six young helpless chidren, who are quite unprirotected, as the husband's duties oblige him to be absent during the day. He is a steady man and of good character.
if yon will kindly allow a place in your journal for these few lines I feel sure that very many persons will be as anxious as I was myself when I heard the sad story to contribute their mitein aid of the distressed family.

..Iupumg country flour, the arrivals last week were very canty, those of wheat being quadrapled by the exports. The latter were-in wheat, 4,929 quarttrs; oats, 50 quarters; flour, 785 sacks. The arrivals of native wheat were 5,718 quarters; the foreign only 1,102 quarters. The
lOrnng's supply froum lKent and Essex wns moderate; the ewsamplesof reallJ fine dry wheat onobhow sold rather better thaD On this day se'nnighet, but i,ferior continued neglected. There was rather more trado in foreign, both for consumption and export, at full rates.
Of foreign flour the supply was only 307 barrels; of English, 19,003 ssaks. Norfolks found anore favour, and rested at 41s. per sack. American was but in moderate demnand at former rates. Town-made unchtnged.
The receipts in barley were 1,387 quarters from abroad, amd 4,306 quarters of home-growth. In the absence of fine Malting qualities the secondary sorts found a better sale at the previous prices, and grinding descriptions were more readily placed.
Mfalt was unaltered.
The quantity of English beans was 1,385 quarters; the foreign, 32$ quarters. There was a better demand at unaltered prices.
Peas were all of home-growth, amounting to 450 quarters. The seed demand being on rates well sustained.
WIth 1,260 quarters linseed exported, and nothing reCeived, business was but slow at the late advance without change of prices. The brisk inquiry for seed- has continued, red cloverseed, with limited supplies, realizing about 2s. more for average qualities, white aud trefoil being well supported. Tares were more in request, and foreign spring brought 2s. per quarter more money, with a further ad. vance required by holders. Canary very dull and rather cheaper. Mustardseed, hempseed, and other sorts of seeds much as last quoted.

Election Intelligence.
ELECTIO2 INTBLLIGEKCB.
OnTri:a VQ11Vr
The nomination of candidates for the representation of this borough, vacant by the resignation of the Right Hon. Lord J. Manners, took place yesterday morning upon commodious hustinug erected in front of the Town-ball. During the last fortnight an active canvass has been carried on by the friends of each candidate, and it is expected to be the moat severely-contested election which has taken place in this borough for many years. The weather being fine, there was a large assemblage of persons of aU classes, and great excitement prevailed, but the proceedings passed off quietly.
The usualreliminarieshbaving been gone through,
Mr.H. oiO, the .Mayor, called upon any persons having candidates to prooose to address the meeting.
Mr. G. Romm, an opu.lent banker, then nominated Mr. T. J. Miller as a proper person for the representation of the borough, which was seconded by Mr. J. Coor;, the exMayor,
Mr. S. BROWN0 , silk merchant, nominated, and Mr. PmLBIacK, a solicitor, seconded Mr. 3. Gardon Rebow, the Liberal candidate. In the couse of the latter gentleman's observations he contended that Mr. MIlUer, having been unseated by a committee of the House of Commons for bribery and treating by his agents, ought not to be elected as their representative to the exclusion of Mr. Rebow, whose local standing and influence invested him with a superior claim.
Mr. VENs, an eccentric banrister, amid roars of laughter, then came forward to nominate himself.
'This gentleman's nomination having been seconded by a wvorking man,
Mr. MLLEB first addressed the electors amid great confusion. lHe first referred to the blue-book of the House of Commons, and also to the report of the Bribery Commission at Maldon, to show that the bribery and treating were without his concurrence, and therefore he was not open to an charge; and, having combited some personalities in which his opponents had indulged, he stated his political opinions. Since he had announced to the electors his intention of coming forward as a cmdidate the Ministry had brought forward the budget - and he congratulated thosepresent that in consequence of the pressure put upon the Government by the Conservatives the Whig Ministry had been compelled to remit a large portion of the Income-tax. But the Income-tax was not the only war tax imposed. A much more important tax was levied, whioh it was the duty of the Government, and in good faith with its promises to the country, to have taken off-the duty on tea, which at the present moment was Is. 9d. per lb. instead of Is., And therefore pressed with great sever.ty upon the poorer classes of the community. If he were returned to Parliament he would direct his attention to the reduction of all those taxes which pressed most heavily on the industrial classes and those who were least able to bear them. He was an advocate for the most enlightened exercise of religious freedom, and he could say with aU his heart, 1t Thank God, the days of persecution have passed awvy for ever." But at the same time he must distinguish between protecting and encouraging that which was opposed to r,ligious freedom and the spirit of truth, and in the grant to Maynooth they were encouraging that which he beheved to be error, and opposed to the best interests of his fellow-menand therefore he should be opposed to the continuance oi the grant. (Loud cheers.) He would, however, be prepared to encourage and sustain education in every Protestant iastttion through the kingdom, and, as a Conservative, notwithstanding al the charges of tyranny brought against that body, he hoped he should ever feel it his duty and honour to watch over the religious education of the common people (Cheers.) As to church-rates, he understood tbat SirW Clay had introduced a BiU for their entire abolition without any sort of compensation, but with that be could not concur, when he gave it as his opinion that church-rates were the property of the church, and had been sofrom the earliest period, that their origin was coeval with tithes and with the church itself, and their legality was now firstly established by the opinion of Dr. Lushington, one of the maost eminent Civilians of the day. If that were so, and the principle of their total abolition were adopted, then the funds of any religious institution might be confiscated, and even a mansp vate proert miht be seized. (" Oh, oh," and uproar.) The Church of England was a tolerant church, and so long as they maintained it in its integrity, whatever
ight be their relhgious opinions, they would obtain the advantage of its protection and succour, and there was no argument which applied to the abrogation of church-rates which did not apply with equal force to the destruction of ithes and every other kind of church property. (Cheers.) If they honoured him with the representation of the borough he would do his beat for the interests of the town and commnumity, and among other objects would further the weekly half holyday and the formation of parks and places of public resort for the people. (Cheers.
Mr. REBOW, amid much cheering, next addressed the electors, and said after the war had been brought to a triumphant issue, and the purposes for which it was commenced hsad been accomplished, the purpose of the Government was to reduce the war establishuient to a peace level, and they had commenced this work of reduction, which, however, might not be effected for some time. They were now told that the reduction of the Income-tax was effected by the Ministry in consequence of the pressure put upon them by the Conservatives; but that was a farce, for it was known six months ago that the Government had intended to take off the war tax, though many things connected with the budget had not then come to light. Theme were other debts connected with the war which would have to be aid during the next four years, and at that time (1860) 3,000,)000. of long annuities would fal in, and the countr7 would be able to allow the abolition of the 7,000,000 of income now coleoted by means of the Income-tax. (Cheers.) He was opposed to the Income-tax except upon great occasions, and for theaccomplishmentof great purposes, and he hoped never to see the necessity for its reimposition. (Cheers.) Upon the question of education, which was a subject of vast importance, he need only say during the last 50 years the country had made very rapid strides, and they had proofs in the improved intellgence and progressive prosperity of thxe country of the advance so mnade. And yet thev saw twothirds of the criminals brought before them unable to read and write, or able to read only imperfectly; and the fact was they were not sent to school long enough for the moral or religious principle to be developed before they were sent upon the world. This was a subject which would engage the attention of the Legislature, and if he were returned should have his careful consideration. (Cheers.) Withoutgoing into the theological objections to the grant to Maynooth when he saw the priests of the Church of Rome educatedai
that college fostering principles inimical to the well-being of the community, then he contended that they ought to cease to endow such an institution. (Cheers.) Upon the questionof church-rates, as it was bylaw nowdetermined that the majority of a vestry only could mke a rate, and if by the refusal to make such a rate the church inevitably would fall from want of repair, then he looked upon it as the feeling of all persons that some Legislative intesference should take place for the settlement of this long-disputed question, either by pew rents or some other means. (Cheers.) With respect to a reform in Parliament, this country was nowin so prosperous a condition that he saw no necessity for immediate reform, if he omitted the question of the extension of the franchise. He thought every man who paid rates and taxes should have a voice in making the laws, and in order to prevent intimidation or undue influence, he thought some new mode of recording a vote was indispensable-either the ballot or a system of secret voting similar to that adopted in the electoion of boards of guardians. He then alluded to a few stioctly local matters, and expressed a hope that he should be returned as their representative. (Cheers.)
Mr. HAVENs also addressed the meeting in a facetious speech, advocating the maintenance of the Maynooth endowment till al end6wments ceased, and urging the inportance of the separation of Church and State.
The show of hands was in favour of Mr. Rebow, and a poll, demanded by the other candidates, was fixed for this day (Tuesday).
Thanks were then voted to the Mayer, and the crowd quietly dispersed.________
Hospices On Barren Islands.
HOSPICES Or BARREB NSLANDS.
TO THEX EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The following is an extract from a letter written to me by a gentleman on whose statements reliance may be placed:-
" I spent five days at St. Paul's Island in the sprieg of 1853. All the remarks made by Mr. Postans are substantially correct. The island is now inhabited. We found a Frenchmnan there and four Creoles from the Mauritius. They were engaged catching and curing hsh, which are taken in enormous quantities and with very little trouble. They have also a small schooner trading witl their produceIt strike6 me that you have confused St. Paul's with Amsterdam. They are only 30 mIles asart; Amsterdam is to the northwardof St. Paul's, and is indeed 'a barren rock.' It was upon Amsterdam that the emigrant ship Meridisn wma totally lost in 1813 or lS4. After the most frightful sufrerings the crew and passengers, or rather a portion of each, were rescued by an American captain named Ludlow. I regret I cannot remember tbe name of his ship. A very handsome testimonial, in the shape of money and medals and plate, waS presented to him by the English colonists for his bravery and umanity.
eaw several of the pamsengere who were saved in Sydney: among them Mr. Lutwyche, barrister-at-law who is, orwa,Sleor General of the colony o1 New Soutbh Wales." a lcor
From the above, it is quite evident that I have "confused" the two islands, and it is equally evident that, if hospices are to be erected on barren and uninhabited islands, one should be on Amsterdam.
Mr. Postans is not singular in his impression that the stores, provisions, and comforts left on these desolate islands for the shipwsrecked would be appropriated by persons not in distress. I have received several letters containing the identical suggestion, but, for 3my part, I will not believe human nature to be quite so low and degraded.
So far as English seamen are concerned, an act might be passed making it "felony" to offend in such wise; and other nations would, no doubt, make a law equally stringent. No master of a vessel, with this Act staring at him on landing, would place himself at the mercy of his crew, and run the risk of incurring so great a penalty for sosmallan advantage. An appeal might also be made
in large letters-an appeal such as none but savages would. disregard.
Storekeepers have been suggested by several correspondents, and one gentleman in Birmingham has offered to provide "volunteers." To this part of the scheme I am decidedly opposed. It will be time enough to have storekeepers when experience shall have taught us that they are absolutely necessary. My object is to render a great service at a comparatively small cost * and I am assured by many persons of experience-severai contractors included-that the sum of 75,0001. would be ample for the execution of the design, provided the Government will find the vessels required for the service. I am aware that no Government likes to be "prompted," but I make bold to ask-Could the
Resolute be better employed?
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant.

CHBSTEB.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I had not anticipated tha' in asking a question concerning the distress among the soldiers' wives at Colchester, Sir John Tyrell would have produced before the House part of a correspondence upon this sad subject.
Since my statement was read, I have been urged to appeal through you to the public for immediate assistance and sympathy.
It will surprise those who imagine that the soldier isbeing made a respectable, moral, and religious member of society, when they are assured that more than 130 soldiers' families were, at the commencement of the late severe weather,utterly destitute of proper clothing and bedding, and nearly starving;that, had it notbeen for the charity of their oflicers and of the townspeople, they would have perished; and that even now, if the benevolence of those who visit these unfortunates be relaxed, the same result would ensue.
I can bear witness to there being much degrading misery among those families, which were never in a like plight before-degrading, for it is the misery of extreme want with the remembrance of former comforts, which have not been lost by misbehaviour.
It isabsurd to wait for the results of a Government inquiry into this distress, fer it is absolutely necessary for those who take aninterest in the case to have funds to feed those who cannot obtain work, and who cannot subsist upon their soldier-husbands' pay, diminished as it is by " stoppages "-to find clothing and bedding, and to redeem those articles which were pawned during the first weeks of want.
It is, moreover, necessary to remove the poor creaturcs from the squalid lodgings they occupy in the worst neighbourhoods, to cheap and well-ordered dwellings. Above all, it is necessary th&t the voice of -public opinion should be heard protesting against the continuance of this distress which has been produced by the transmission of the depbts of certain regiments from Ireland to this place.
Subscriptions will be thankfully received by those gentle. men who were mentioned by Sir John Tyrell in his speech on Friday last, and by
Yours obediently,

The Camp At The Curragh.
THE CAMP Ai THE OURBAGH.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-MIay I request space to be allowed, in such a univer. sally-read journal as Uhe Times, to caU the earnest attention of the British public to the case of a most unhappy portion of the community? I allude to the wretched daughters of guilt and misery who, sunk in degradation, are, themnselve.s see mgly hopeless, the tempters of youth and innocence.
My own mind has been led to dwell seriously and most sorrowfully upon this painul subject by the occurences which are common in this place. The cam is situated nearly in the centre of the wide and extensive urragh. The unfortunate female outcasts are not suffered to trespass upon the Curragh, as far as human vigilance can prevent that evil. Hence aU the leading roads around it are infested day and night by the sad specimens of depraved and de. graded humanity. When any of these are apprehended for trespassing, or for being drunk or disorderly, they are committed to prison for a certain period, varying from 48 hours to a week. Then they are released, with no resource butto return to their miserable haunts. If there were asylums provided by the Legislature for the reception of these poor castaways, to which they might be consigned, as places of amendment as weeU as punishment, some, if not many brands, might be plucked out of the fire. Reformatories for refuge and discipline might prove an incalculable blessing to thousands of poor wretches, whose present state a ppears to be only a horrible descent to dismal graves. Who that thinks of these objects of commiseration, and of the mothers that nursed them, does not sigh and pray for a door of escape to be opened to them ?
Hf national reformatoxies for such hapless creatures were localized throughout Britain, no one could rightly estimate the happy results. A lodgment in gaol under present arrangements entails heavy expense upon the country, and A vast amount of irksome duty upon the constabulary and others. Yet to wliat purpose? The parties committed to prson lie there for a tinie, are sent forth anew on their
downward career, are again laid in prison, until an awful death closestheheartrending history; whereas a reformatory, affcrdingtime forreSlectionandremonstrance,might, through the Divine blessing, restore lost daughters from a lot worse than death. Therearenotprovidednowany invitin gates in every district into which conscience-stricken or eavyladen sufferers might seek to find entrance as a relief from mental angush or bodily torture. In the cold, tempestuous nights of this dreary winter, what numbers of those who
*ave shivered all night long through the pitiless storms under hedges, or behind the ditches, might have thanked God for a refuge such as a reformatory ?
I trust, Sir, thab this matter may arrest the attention of the benevolent and influential in society, so as to produce vigorous, practical, and prompt efforts to ameliorate the deploabl coditon f toseforwho evryone's heart must

This caso was resumed and concluded. Jobn Scott, late of South Shields, in the county of Durham, gave 30 shares held by him in the Newcastle, Shields, and Sunderland Union JointStock Banking Company, and certain real estate, to his executors upon trust to pay the dividends on the shares and the rents of the real estate towards the maintenance and education of Margaret Jobson (now Mfargaret Tindle) during her misnority, and, upon her attaining 21 years of age, upon trust to pay such dividends and rents to her for her separate use, with a restriction on anticipation, and after her death for the benefit of her children. The testator by his will bequeathed several pecUniary legacies, and gave his residuary personal estate to his nephews and meces. The testator died in June, 1845. In January, 1853, an order was made to wind up the affairs of the Newcastle, Shields, and Sunderland Union Joint-Stock Banking Company, andthe plaintiffs wereplacedonthe listof contributories as executors of the testatorin respect of the above 30 shares. A callof 201. per share having been made on the contributoriesof the banking company, the official manager instituted a creditors suit at the Rolls against the executors of John Scott, for the purpose of obtaining payment of the sum of 001. for the call of 201. per share on the 30 shares held by the testator, and by the decree of the Master of the Rolls, mado in June, 1855, the cal was held to be a debt due from the testator's estate. The executors had paid the cal out of a balance of the testator's residuary personalty in their hands, and the present suit was instituted for determining the qestion whether such call should be borne by the tes. tato.s residuary estate or by the specific legatee of the shares olut of the real estate devised for her benefit. It appeared that MArgaret Jobson, to whom the shares were given for her separate use for life, had only recently attained 2i years of ae, and that immediately upon doing so she renounced the oequest to her of the shares. But it was stated, although there was no evidence on this point, that the dividends or the shares had been paid to her father in the interval between the testator's death and the stoppage of the bank for her maintenance and benefit.
Xr. Mains andMrx John Hinde Paler appeared for the plaintiffs the executors; Mr. Bacon, Mr. C:. P Rounpell, Mr. Roxurgb, and Mr. Lonsdalefor the residuary legatees ; and Mr. ira m and Mr. Wakefield for Margaret Jobson, the specific legatee of the shares
The VICs-AnC"mLon held that the debt in respect of the cals on the shares belonging to the testator was payable out of his residuary estate, beiog of opinion that the assent of the executors to the bequest of these shares to Margrret Jobson could not impose any liability on her in respect of them, she having renounced the bequest of them to her as soon as she came of age.

TRACY V. THE EGLIMS A2D FOREIGN IjFE ASSURABNC
SOCIETY.
Oulzazg$ as NSW Ius, before tlk CmIzF BARION and a
Specia Jurv. at Guildhau.)
mr. 5erjeant tSee, Mtr. J. Brown, and M1r. McNamara were counsel for the plaintiff; Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Serjeant Hayes, and Mr. Beasley appeared for the defendants.
This was an action to recover 5001. on a policy for three years on the life of David Tracy, whose wife and adniinistratrix was the plaintiff. The defendanth pleaded, 1st, that the allegation in the proposal that David Tracy was of temperate habits was wilfuly untrue - 2d, that Tracy wilfuUy omitted to state that he 'was in bad health, aud afflicted with a cough, and was inteniperate; &d, that he wilfully omitted to state that his Hife had he en proposcd for nsurance and accepted at the Achiles-office. The affirmative of these pleas being on the defendants, they called witnesses in support of them in the first instance. As to the first two pleas it was eventually admitted by the defendants that they could not look to obtain a verdict on them, the learned serjeant stating that he was prepared with numerous witnesses to show that the habits of the deceased, who was 68 years old, were temperate and regular, and that his life was con,idered an excellent one at the date of the policy, which was in May, 1856, his death having been occasioned shortly after by an attack of low typhoid fever, attributed to the defective drainage of his residence. As to the last issne it was clearly proved, and admitted to be the fact, that at the time the policy in question was effected the lfe of Mr. Tracy was insured in the Achilles office, but in explanation the plaintiff called Mr. Riobinson, who stated that he had filled up the proposal for Mr. Tracy, and had omitted to state the existence of the Achilles policy, while he did set forth another with the Age office, through pure forgetfulness, and no' fronm ny wilful design to conceal the -fact. Without entering into the private history of M1r. Tracy and Mr. Rtobimson, it may suffice to state that the jury, after having retired for nearly two hours to consider their verdict, came int court with a findin)g for the plaintiff, accompanied hy the statement that, in their opinion, the defendants were justified in disputing and investigating the claim.
Verdict for the plaintiff for 5001, accordingly.

APPLEBY. Pun 91. -
'ehO learned Judges of this assize arrived bere yesterday afternoon, and Mr. Baron Martin immediately opened the commission and attended divine tervice.
The Courts sat this morning at 10 o'clock, Mr. Justice Crompton sitting in the Crown Court and charging the grand jury.
The calendar contained the names of six priEoners, threo charged with night poaching, two with burglary, and one with larceny. Thore was also a charge of perjury.
The cause list had an entry of one cause.
CROWN CoURT.-(Bcfore Air. Tustike CRO3&PTON.)
Thomas Braithwaite, aged 21, Richard Powley, aged 21, an d John Powley, aged 19, were indicted for night poaching and, being armed with sticks and bludgeons, with assaulting John Thornbarrow and others, gamekeepers of the Earl of Lonsdale.
Mr. Monk prosocuted, and Mr. Scott defended the prisoners.
it appeared that the prisoners, three very decent-looking oung mnen, two of them brothers, were seen out on somo ands, thoprgerty of the Earl of Lonsdale, on the night of the 7th of November last, by Thornbarrow, a keener, and three watchers. They had a do with them and a not, and were stopping up the "smouts,' through which the hares ran, when the keepers ran in upon them. The prisoners ran away, but hiing overtaken were attacked by the keepers, and a short fight ensued, in which the prisoriers usei sticks they bad in their hands and threw stones, and Thorabarrow received two or three severe blowrs. The three prisoners wrere overpowvered and handcuffed, and were somewhat roughly used by the keepes. These facts having been proved, the learned counselfor the prisones addressed thejury, and his Lordship summed up.
T he jury retired, and returned with a verdict of not guilty of being armed, and " guilty of trespass."
His LoxwsDssp told them that was no verdict, again cxp laied the charge against the prisoners, and sent the jury hack again.
The jury returned vwith a similar verdict, and
ltis LORDsIP then wrote down an abstrsct of the charge aginst the prisoners and delivered it to the foreman, explaining the facts proved bearing upon it ; and the jury a,ai retired, and returned with a verdict of Guilty of mght poaching and assaulting the keepers, but recommendlug them to mercy on account of their youth.
s LonnssPsentenced Braithwaitc and Richard Pow. ley to two months' imprsonment each, and John Powley to four months' imprisonment, he having been out on bail:
John Standish was indicted for wilful and corrupt per3ury at the County Court at Ambleside, in having, on the
t 'of November last, sworn to an agreement made by one John Crossley on the 10th of May last to let him certain premises at 101. a-year rent for a year certain, which alleged agreement John Crossley had broken; and the defendant then sought to recover damages for the breach of the agreement when, in fact, no such agreement had ever been sande. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty."
Mr. Monk and Mr. C. Foster appeared for the prosecation, and Mr. Scott for the defence.
The learned counsel for the prisoner moved, on an affidavit alleging the absence of material witnesses for the deence, and that the defendant had not had time sinco his commrtment to prepare for his defence, to have his trial postponed.
This was not resisted by the learned counsel for the prosecution, the case being one of considerable importance, which it was notwished unduly to forco on, and
His LoRDSHip thereupon ordered the trial to be postponed to the next assizes, the defendant to give 24 hours' notice of fresh bail.
The other prisoners pleaded " Guilty." This finished the criminal assizes.
CIVm COu T.-(Bcfoerc Mr. Baron MAR.TIN.)
HILL V. ADAXTHWA.ITE.
Mr. Edward James, Q.C., and Mr. E. M. Fenwick appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Monk for the defendant.
This was an action of espagainst the defendant for having pulled down and ekn away a boiler and trough from a farm in the occupation of the defendant, who, among other pleas, pleaded that these fixtures were not the property of the plaintiff.
Mr. J,mI, in opening the case for the plaintiff, stated that the defendant had been the tenant of a farm called Whitwell, in this count7, which had been purchased in November, 1853, by the plamtiff, a gentleman residing in the neighbourhood of Appleby, from the executors of Miss Hlutchinson, and the defendant had at the time of the purchase an unexpired term of two years of the farm. During the time of the defendant's tenancy be bad put up the boiler and trough in the farmyard for the purpose of feeding his cattle, and had also used them occasiona11y for domestic purposes, and having had notice to quit he had, as he alleged, made an arrangement with the incoming tenant, Alderson, that tho fixtures in question should be purchased by him, conceiving that the articles were clearly tenant's fu tures, and such as he was entitled to sell or remove. Some delay having taken place, this negotiation eventually went off, in consequence of Alderson's being about to leave the farm, and the defendant hearing this went to the premises upon the very day that Alderson had left, and before the new tenant came in, and pulled out the fixtures, tearing away the brick and atone work with which they were fastened to the walL. This had been done witbout any authority from the landlord, who insisted that he had purchased the fixtures and everything connected with the farm under the conveyance of November, 1853 ; and in furtherance of this assurauce he had sent his bailiff to watch a sale which was had at the time of the defendant's retirement from the premises, for the purpose of seeing that no portion of thefixtures were taken away, and according to the evidence of this witness no mention had then been made of any claim upon the defendant's part to the articles spoken of.
After hearing some conflicting evidence on the part of the defendant,
Mr. Baron MIARTn suggested that, as at the present time the question of what were and what were not agricultural fixtures was one of some nicety, whether it would not be I better for both parties to agree to withdraw a juror, as it was matter of much doubt whether the Courts might not in these days, when so great an advancehadtakenplace in agriculture, hold mnore libral viewvs as to what were a'ricultural fixtures than those entertained and considered l'aw since the time of Lord Ellenborough.
A juror was thereupon withdrawn. This finished the civil business.
Middlesex Sessions, Monday, Feb. 23.
AIDDZrSEX SESSIO , fMonday, Feb. 23.
(Before Mr. PASHZY, Q.C., Assistant-Judge)
The Court sat to-day to hear rate appeals. There were 10 in the paper, three of which were for iudgment, five were adjourned over, and in one, " The London and SouthWesterm RailWay Company v. the Poor-rate of Staines," the rate was reduced by consent. The cases for judgment were-" Jonathan Poulter v. a Paving and Lighting Rate of Poplar' (All Saints), in -which the Court confirmed the rate; and two appeals by John White against the poor-rate and the paving and lighting rate of the same parish, the rate in both cases being struck out by the Court.
TEE EAST LONDON NVATERNVORKIS COMPANY V. THE
POOR-RATE OF ST. JOHN, HIACKNEY.
Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Huddleston were counsel for the appellant - Mr M Chambers, QC, and 3ir Bodkin for the respndents. br,QC,adM.Bdi
Mr. BOVILL said, the rate appealed against was dated April 25, 1855, and in the first instance the comyauy appealed to the trustees under the local Act, and from the trustees they came to this Court. For some eight or nine years past the property possessed by the company in the parish of St. John, Hackney, was assessed at 2,5001. It was then raised all at once to 12,0001., but the local board reduced that amount to 7,126. The ground upon which the assessment was raised was that the company had been at a large outlay upon their works. They had provided filtering-beds at r cost of 25,0001, but that was under the " Water Supply Act," which required companies supplying London
with water to provide such beds, and that the water, after being passed through them, should not be carried through any uncovered channel or cut, but through pipes. The companyhad laid down pipes of 48 inches diameter at a cost of 14,0001. This was an outlay forced upon them by Act of Parliament. It was a great tax upon them, and, instead of producing any return, it diminished rather than increased their profit, so that the ground upon which the parish went in raising the assessment was fallacious. There vere an engna nd an engine-house to be provided for additional
torcing power, and that cost 9,O0OOC, but it yielded only an infinitesmal portion of profit, andwas totally unproductive i this particular parish. The learned coonqml went into a lengthed detail, after which
It was arranged that the case shoald be adjouirued until next sessious for a farther examinatioa as to figures on both

MAXSION-.ousE.-The LORD MAYOr requested that the cress would acknowledge his receipt of the firt h alf of a ol.-nota, No. 13,770, for the poor-box.
GuTDHALL.-Mary Ann Olive, a woman about 40 years of age, and Samuel Olive, her son, a lad 12 years old, were placed at the bar before Alderman ROSE, charged with feloniouslyreceivinga quantity of type, afleged to bave been stolen from lessrs. :Eyre and Spottiswoode's, the Queen's printers.
The lad was discharged, the woman was remanded.
BOW-STREXT.-A well dressed, military-looking, elderly man, with a bald head, thick white moustache, beard, and whiskers, and generally good " make up," was charged by Major-General Lord lokeby with fraudulently obtaining 8b. from him for a pretended charitable purpose.
The prisoner first called upon his Lordship on the 14th of January, when be presented a letter purporting to be written by a Mrs. Duke, now in great distress, but forxnerly, ana under more prosperous circumstances, known to his Lordship. Tho letter was most artfuly written, commencingby a disavowal on the part of the writer of any claim upon his Lordship, but expressing confidence iu his generosity, and begging him to help one who had been cruellyneglet b7 those uponwlhomshbehad claims. She
id that she was m "a state of the most appalling desti. tution,e and must have literally tarved btt for the, kindness of -Mr. Wilson, the bearer of the letter, who,
she said, was "generosity itself," but whose means were limited, and who had a large family of his own. She added that she was suffering from paralysis, and that the heartless landlord was about to turn her out into the streets. The prisoner,gave such an account of the woman's antecedents as entirely agreed with so much of the facts as his Lordship was acquainted with. He had already a atrong feeling in favour of Mrs. Dtike, believing that she had been .very cruelly treated by the persons aluded to in her letter, and the prisoner pleaded her cause with such earnest eloquence, and drewt so vivid und pathetic a picture of her stfferings, that hiB Lordship was deeply affected, He gave the prisoner 61. on that occasion. Subsequently the prisoner called again with a second letter, containing the warmest protestations ~of gratitude for the U., and declaring that his Lordship and Mr. Wilson were the only Dersons who had shown the least sympathy for her, nad that she would bless them with her last breath. She added, however, that her health was still worse, that she had had two fits of paralysis since her last letter, and that she was gradually sikin g.Neither of these letters contained the writers daddes, buit even this circumnstesnc did not excite the suspicions of the noble complainant, who on this occasion gave the prisoner 31. A few days ago the prisoner called with a third letter, in which the pretended Mrs. Duke declared herself worse than ever. She feared she mrust be removed. to the workhouse, but doubtedwhether she should live to reach it. This letter being dated from "7, Felix-street, Lambetih," his Lordship determined to call there and inquire into the case, but, without informing the prisoner of this intention, madeanappointment to meethim at the Wellinzton Backs on Saturday. On calling at Felix-street, his tordehip discovered that no such person as Mrs. Duke lived there. He then communicated with Sir l. Rayne, who instructed Inspector Thormbury, of the detective force, to take the mater tnp. Accordingly, the Inspector, with Sergeant Smith, of the same force, was in attendance on Satuirday, when the prisoner called at the Wellington Barracks by appointment. His Lordship told the prisoner he had discovered that the story was a fabrication, when the prisoner begged his Lordship not to prosecute him, and offered to return the money. His Lordship caUed in the detectives and gave him in charge.
Mlr. Burnaby, the chief clerk, read the whole of the letters, and called his Worship's attention to the circumstatce that the handwriting, which in the first was firm and regular, became somewhat feeble and uncertain in the second, and exceedingly irregular in the third, so as precisely to correspond with the alleged gradual sinking of the system un.der increasing infirmity.
The prisoner, waho appeared very much agitated, declined to say anything in defence, but threw himself on the mercy of the court. .te refused to state his address or occupation, or giV his rea name, but adaitted that it wvas not
Mr. H=ENy said that if the prisoner could not give a satisfactory explanation he (the magistrate) would commit him for three months. In the meanwhile, however, he must be remanded to give time for further inquiries.
AI,tLOROUGH-STREET.-5l 5s., An unappropriated balance of mess-money from the ward-room officers, late of Her Majesty's ship Algiers have been sent for the poor-box.
WEST ncsTm-Henry Garden, a youth, was charged wvith the following daring street robb~ery:-
Joseph Kayes, a private in tlhe Grenadier Guards, stated that bet'ween 9 and 10 o'clock on the previous night he was passing through the Broadway, Westminster, on his way ome, when he was suddenly attacked by the prisoner ana another fellow. The latter gave him a violent blow on the eye, and bcfore he could recover the effects of it the
risoner snatched his Crimean medal with four clasps from Cis breast, and endeavoured to make off, but he held him securely by the arm until the arrival of a policeman. The medal was not recovered.
Prisoner, in reply to the charge, pretended that the soldier was talking to a married woman, when her husband came up and struck him, and the medal was lost in a general fight.
George Dows, a respectable labouring man, completely confirmed the soldier's statement that he was harmlessl
walking along when he was attacked as he had desoribe. When the prnsoner was seized by the soldier he threw the medal to somebody in the crowd.
Prisoner was remanded.

LIVERPOOL, MIONDAY.
The Black Ball packetship Ocean Chief, Captain Tobin,which was telegraphed off Holyhead yesterday, has arrived, with upwards of 72,311 ounces of gold, zand advvicea from Melbourne to the 2d of December. She also brings 1,995 bales of wool, 45 casks of tallow, 43 casks of salted mutton, 40 hogsheads of tin ore, 999 casks of copper, and 24 cases of mer-
The Blackwall, with about 8G,647 ounces of gold, '754 bales of wool, 150 casks of tallow, 28 casks of black sand, 3,110 bags of copper ore, 30 casks of mnuntz metal, 154 bags of bone, and 3 cases of wine, sailed for London in company with the Ocean Chief. Hler Majesty's ship Electra, for Portsmouth, with upwards of 15,000 ounces of gold on freight, left the Heads on the 30th of November.
The Marco Polo, hence, with the mails of September 5, had arrived at Melbourne.
The Roval Charter and the Oneida had not arrived ,out.
The following were the projected departores from Melbourne :-For Liverpool, the White Star, early in December. For London, the Mermaid, early in December; the Admiral, December 12 ; the Orwell, December 23; the Austaal, about December 25; the Copenhagen, January 10; and the Cairngorm, about January 20.
The official opening of the new Parliament took place on the 25th of November. The day was observed as a general holyday, the streets were decorated with flags, and the roofs and windows of the houses were crowded with people. The pathways were lined with military and police. As his Excellency left his residence trumpets sounded, and a salute of 19 guns was fired. The Parliamenthouse was densely packed with ladies and gentlemen, and, what with the decorations and the variety of dresses, the effect was stiking.
Dr. Palmer, the former Speaker of the Legislative Council, bad been re-elected to that position. Dr. F. Murphy had been elected Speaker of the Assembly. The following account is given of the proceedings-
" His Excellency, in his address, expressed the satisfaction he felt at having the opportunity of congratulating the Assembly upon the attainment of the object-self-governmnent-for which the country had struggled for manyyears ; and also his confidence in the people of Victoria not only valuing the privilege, but preparnv to meet the increase of responsibility which it imposed on all, and to throw off that apathy with whichpolitical affairs had hitherto beentoo genevr.lly treated, and in doing which they would conduce to the happiness and prosperityof thew hole country. Hepointed out that it would be their constant duty to watch the operation, and to amend the defects, of the fundamental law from which they derived their existence and powers. The circumstances under which the charter was prepared and granted rendered it likely that many changes would be ne cessary, but he should only call upon them to alter those which actual experience demonstrated were necessary. He did not approve a partial reform, without the component parts being considered, but while he would not recommend a recasting of the electoral division of the country until the results of the census, proposed to be taken during the summer, were ascertained, their attention would be drawn to the patent imperfection and ianequalty of the electoral franchise, and they would be asked to extend the basis of the suffrage, and to amend the law regulating the registration of electors. One of the princlpal duties would be the promotion of the reform and the maintenance of the efficiency of the public administration in its several branches. He would submit to them a measure founded on the same principle as that adoptedi by the Home Government for the reorganization of the civil service, by which the admission to the junior grade of the ordinary civil service would be determined by a competitive examination, open to all persons, and eonducted by a permanent board; the service to be divided into classes; the promotion to a superior class to depend solely upon ascertained fitness, and extend over the entire service, and not on a particular department; and, amnouncing that they would have to consider matters of finance, his Excellency expressed his opinion that the functions of the Audit Department should be enlarged, and that it should possess povwers similar to those of the Controller of the Exchequer and the Comanisioners of Audit, the Auditor-General being independent of the executive Government, but liable to be removed from office by the Legislature. The extension of facilities for the collection and disbursement of public moneys and the consolidation of departments would have to be considered, as 'would also the repeal of the laws regulating the sale and occupation of Crown lands. Bills for the continuance of the system of sales by auction, and of the present upset price ; for the more speedy issue of deeds of grant, by dispensing with double registration; the concession of facilities to owners of land for contracting with persons deeirous to mine for gold, saving inviolate the rights of the freeholder to the undisturbed possession of his land; the rescinding the existing orders in Council regulating occapation for pastoral and other purposes; the power of granting an interest to the present occupant, renewable until the land is required for sale or any public purpose, but subject to an acreable rent, to be periodically
-etermined by an independent tribunal, according to the grazing capabilities of the land and the advantages of its situation, and the adjustment of claims on account of actual losses sustained by occupants, would be laid before them. He impressed upon them the desirability of promoting public works, especiaUy railways, and of extending municipal institutions, measures for securing which would be submitted to them. 'reliminary steps had been taken for extending the lines of electric telegraph to the northern and western frontiers, so as to connect al the principal towns and goldfields with M elbourne, which would be proceeded with upon their sanction being obtained. Provision for the construction of roads and for the improvement of the main lines of road, which would require a large expenditure ; the amendments in the operations of the Municipalities Act, which -experience had shown to be desirable; the subject of the agricultural capabilities of the country; the managemnent of the Customs and merchant shipping, tMe latter including provision for the examination of masters and mates in the colonial marine, and for the better protection and management of seamen would be placed before them, and wouid require their attention. He also directed their attention to an entire change in the law restraining certain trades, especially the sale of fermented and spirituous liquors and distilation, the evils from the prohibition of the iatter being productive of much public immorality. A measure to amend the laws relating to banking and the issue of notes payable on demand would ibe submitted to them. They would cperceive from the papers which would be transmitted to them that the Gsovernors of South Australia and Tasmania had agrecd to propose to the respective Legislatures a scheme for connectYng helbourne with Adelaide and Hobart Town by means of the electric telegraph; and he anticipated that by the con-currence of the Governor of New South Wales the union of the four principal towns of the eastern colonies would be completed. A plan for the better lighting of the Australian coast and the maintenance of the lighthouses would be submitted for their approval. A proposal for an assimilation of the tariffs of all the other colonies in conjunction with New South Wales had been made, full particulars of which would be comninnicated to them. It was his intention to subusit to them a measure for promoting education by the establishment of an uni-form and cousprelenisive system of public instruction based upon and in consonance with (he religious sentimeents of the people. The difficulties which had rendered abortive previous attempts to establish a general system did net appear to afibrd sufficient justification to make another effort to effect so desirable an object. An amendment of tihe Constitution Act, which devoted a portion of the public revenue to the promotion of religion, having for its object the admitting to a participation in the grant all subjects of Her AMajesty whose religious tenets were not subversive of morality and good government, wvould also be submitted to tieir consideration, and they would be requested to consider the best means of providing for the -education of deserted children and juvenile criminals. Hlis Excellency announced that there would be laid before thenm various measures for improvin legal procedure, for amending the bankruptcy laws and providing -for a mere simple and effectual method -of distributing insolvent estates; for the acquirement of patents and dibiinishing the expense attendant thereon, And for affording a remedy to persons having claims against the Crown; and for the letter management of the gold'fields, with reference especially to facilities for the settlement of disputes arising -from encroachments, and those connected with mining partnerships.
Hss BXCFzzsNCY, in his aldress to theSpeaker ad gentlemen of the Legislative Assembly, having informed them that the-estimates would be laid before them, stated that he should recommend them to aWropriate considerable sums for the purposes of immjigrtion. Great success had attended
-tho alteration zecently mae in tie regulations for the selection of iinmigrants by-their friends in that country, and he 'hoped by the extension of the system and bv arrangements under which comm"ecialoen(erprise would be more directly enlisted in the -service they should obtain a steady stream -of assisted immigration at a cost do the public treasury
decreasing from year to year. He chould propose the dis.continuance of the serv,ces of .the Colonial Land and Emizlation Commissioners, enid the establishment of a distinct a'encv for Victoria in the United Kingdom.
i&ie Excellency cetired upon the -conclusion of his
speech, the House .paying hinm the compliment, as
they had upon hijs entrance, of risiDg. The House then adjorned for a short isterva:i provious to -the appointment of a connittee No prepare a
draugrht address to has3 E cellecy. The address wvas very soon prepred aend read. to the legislators. It coincided in all the prtposals and recommendations of his Excellency, and -expressed an opinion congenial with that of his Excellency's, that the financial credit of Victori& was most firmly established; that her mineral treasure
was still unlimited; and that under the practic,al eXperience of the miners themselves the improved.1 ,nstbods of working would continue to develope her' rn,sim2,ral wealth for ages. The motion that the ad&ieas ishould be presented to his Excellency by the S1=.idewt and members of the committee by whom itha2 bh% drawn up was carried unanimously The Chairns , of Committe -s having been appointed in the per.'O 4 Mrr. Hodgson, the House, after Peing asied t,2 t opininOX i to the propriety
of members taking off their hats in the presence of the President, a negative one as far as regarded invalids being given, proceeded to business.
His Excellency's address met with considerable adverse criticism, which did not, however, lead to
any result.i
A motion to open the proceedings in the Lower House with prayer was negatived by a majority of two, notwithstanding several petitions in favour of the measure.
The Lower Assembly had named a select comnrittee for the purpose of preparing an address to Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, congratulating Her Majesty on the restoration of peace.
The Argus states that in the Legislature considerable amusement had-beeu occasioned by Mr. Gavan Duffy. By virtue of his Parliamentary experience he had been lecturing the raw levies, perhaps somewhat more than was quite judicious, about the " usages of the Imperial Parliament," and accordingly it was gratifying to the lectured to see their preceptor at fault, and (on a highly important division) voting by mistake with the side he had spoken against. He claimed, however, to have his vote recorded, not according to the side of the House at which he sat during the division, but with the " Ayes." While preferring this claim he startled the House by addressing the Speaker sitting and with his hat on, the practice, as he explained (on being caUled to order for it), not only permitted, but enjoined by the " usages of the Imperial Parliament." He carried both points-kept his hat on and got his vote, which turned the scale, recorded with the " Ayes."
The new clip of wool is coming down fast.
Melville, the man concerned with other convicts in the attempt to escape from the convict guard, in the course of which two men were murdered, had been condemned to death. His fellow-prisoners were acquitted. Melville, after being sentenced, delivered a long harangue on the horrors and crueltisa which the convicts had to suffer daily. His address had gained him many sympathizers, though the evidence showed him to be an atrocious villain of superior ability.
The Syd?y Bmpire reports the discovery of a rich goldfield near the Manning River.
The Argus gives a synopsis of the nativity and opinions of the members of the Lower House. Of the number 4 are Australians, 27 English, I 6 Irish, and 12 Scotch. Thirty-six belong to the (hurch of England, six are Roman Catholics, seven Presbyterians, one Methodist, and seven Independents. In favour of State aid there are 33; against it, 22; doubtful, 4. There are 12 Ministerial and official members, 32 independent, and 15 anti-Ministerialists. There are 19 merchants and tradesmen, 10 barristers and attorneys, 7 Government officers, 16 landowners, 3 medical men, 3 journalists, 2 farmers, and 2 s uatters.
" Black sand'< is likely to become a most important article of commerce. Persons who when its valuable qualities were only known to a few would not invest in its shipment to England now perceive that handsome fortunes might have been made by speculations in it, and are tunring their attention to it. The Ovens a MurraylAdvertiser remarks-
"Hardly a day passes but some new fact or other in connexion with this article, its value, and its component parts, reaches our ears. We have not yet heard of a thoroughly reliable assay of any kind having been made in the neigh. bourhood, and cannot, therefore, apply to any local authority for confirmation or contradiction of some of the statements which have reached us. We are now informed that this black sand contains no inconsiderable quantity of platinum, the marketable value of which is about equal to that of silver, and that the average percentage of tin contained in it is higher than we stated some weeks ago. Our information then led us to believe that the average was not higher than 70 per cent. ; we have now good reasons for believing that it reaches 80 per cent. We must attach credit to these statements, since the raw material has risen and is rising in price, notwithstanding the fall in the price of tin, of which we were informed by the last mail. Under these circunistances we cannot hut imagine that our black sand in reality is worth more than the highest price now obtained for it on these diggings, and we take the liberty, therefore, of suggesting t at a fair sample should be assayed by any competent assayer, in order that the producers may have a guide as to the real value of their article. In the raeant;me we would advise all holders to remain so as long as possible."
The last sales of Government land showed a considerable improvement in prices.
The AMelbouirne Berald states that three nuggets weighing respectively 381, 323, and 189 ounces had been ticked up at Eorong dirggings.
At Mount Alexander a promising lode of copper had been discovered.
The weather was warm and genial, with refreshing showers.
Improvement was noticeable in the retlrns from nearly all the goldfields, particularly Ball,-rat and Maryborough; also from Bendigo, Heathcote, and Creswick Creeks.
Respecting the gold-market the Ar,(us says
" The supply has been good and a large business has been done, especially in bars, for which there is always a good demand, merchants preferring a smrll, but certain profit to the chance of finding a heavy loss upon a purchase of gold dust, there being so much of adulterating the produce of ono field with that of another. As ar instance of this we may mention that nearly the whole of the gold from the Goulburn diggings finds its way to Sandhurst, and is then bought up by the gold buyers as the produce of that field, there being a difference of nearly is. 6d. per oz. We notice that more nuggets have been tm-ned up at Mount Korong, a party having discovered two weighing respectively 381. and 323 oz., together with a large quantity of smaller gold."
COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
The market for imported goods had become more favourable. The Argus says :-
'-The imports which some weeks since crovwded our markets have become more regular; and although stocks generally are very large, and in many cases excessive, the regular demand for consumption has afforded a continuous outlet, and has impa.ted stability to many articles of undoubted brand, of which the bulk of stocks are of inferior quality. A steady healthy trade with the interior is carrying on. The rates of cartage to the diggings are fast approaching summer prices. It appears to be ascertained that our stocks are fully adequate to all our wants, and with every prospect of a cool summer before us a less than ordinary supply of general summer necessaries may prove sufficient for our wants." There was no change in flour. Spirits had declined. Ruum dull of sale. Whisky neglected. Dranght ale and porter dull. Bottled beer readily saleable. Oilmen's stores without alteration. Candles buoyant. Soap unsaleable. Provisions of really prime quality rather improving. Teas looking up. Coffee steady. Building materials in better demand. In soft goods a steady trade, at rather easier rates. At the mines there was an active demand for goods. The roads were in good order, and carriage cheaper. The yield of gold for the week ending the 30th of November was 46,011 ounces, making the receipts fcr the year 2,397,000 ounces, coual to 11,144.1161. The demnand for wGoo was active. The prices raung were-for inferior and well-conditioned clps, 20d. to 214d.; ordinary flcece, 18d. to 20d.; good scoured. 20d. to 22fd.; and heavy fleece, 8.id. to 1hd, per lb. Prices realized in several instances were in advance of those given on the 13th by Ad. to id. per lb., and the wools sold were not in so good condition. Sales of tallowv were effected at 381. per ton, mixed; for mutton, 401. Money was plentiful at S per cent., and 7 percent, for under and 8 per cent. for over 90 days. There was a continued demand for servants of all classes, both agricultural, pastoral, domestic, and mechanical. For the week ending the 22d the imports were 1,515,1961. against exports 1,596,4224 -

Yesalrday the ahele battalion of the Chatham diviion of Royal e arines wssembled on th parade -gound at Chsth am for the purpose of witnessing the presentation of a silver medal, with a gratuity of 1-5i., which had been awarded by the Lords of the Admiralty to Colour-Sergeant Frederick J. Mills, Royal Marines, for long service and meritorious conduct. The battalion having been formed into close column by Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson, the medal was presente l to Sergeant Mlills by Colonel Second-Commandant E. Rea, who said it was always a source of pleamre to present medals of this character, for, although many men were decorated with medals for various services, yet but compa, ratively few had received one for long service and good conduct; the medal would therefore be looked upon as a certificate that the wearer had served his Queen and country with honour and distinction. Sergoant Mills has been upwards of 21 years in the service, 17 of which he has been a non-commissioned officer. He served in Spain under the late Lieutenant-General Sir John Owen, KLC.R, and again in China, for which he is decorated with a medal. He also served in the Baltic, which likewise entitles him to a medaL

THE PENINSULAR MAILS.
[A summary of the following, received by electric tele. graph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday :-]
SOUTHAMPTON, Mo,DyAy.
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship AIhambra, Captain W. J. Woodgates, arrived this morning, at half-past 10, with the mails from the Peninsula, in charge of Lieutenant W. Shaw, R.N., Admiralty agent. She left Gibraltar, Feb. 16th, at 6 p.m.; Cadiz, 17th, at 11.15 a.m.; Lisbon, 19th, at 8.15 a.m.; and Vigo, 20th, at 11 a.m. No communication with Oporto.
This steamer brings 24 passengers (viz., 8 first-clas, 6 second, and 10 deck), 24 packages of specie, valued atll,9261. sterling, and a cargo consisting of 8 cheats of oranges, 100 bags of coffee, 5 casks of wine, 25 boxes of eggs, and 12 pack. ages of general merchandise. Outwards the Alhamnbra experienced a very heavy gale from the southward, in the Bay of Biscay, with a tremendously high cross sea, during the greater part of which time she was obliged to be hove to; particularly fine weather the remainder of the voyage.
At 1.30 p.m. on the 20th inst. the Albambra passed the company's steamer Madrid, off Salbira Island, bound to Vigo, with the outward Peninsular mails.
Cadiz papers to the 15th had been received at Gibraltar. The Conirilbyente, under the head of " important news," says:-
"IWe can positively affirm that Government have sent orders to the squadron lying at Mahon to proceed immediately to Cadiz andjoin the expedition resolved upon against Mexico. The instructions are so pressing that the Isabella IL corvette, vhich was to leave for Mahon, has received counter orders, and the pilots who are to go with the squadron bave already b_oen named, and will probably be here in the course of the week. It is also stated that orders have been re. ceived to get in readiness wr'ithout delay the line-of-battle ship Francisco, the screw steam-frigate Berenguela, and the screv steam-sloops Sauta Teresa and Isabel Francisca (now at Ferrol) for the same purpose. It is asserted that the reinforcements which are to be sent to the army in Cuba will amount to 8,000 men."
The AIhambra brings Lisbon dates of the 19th inst., when the following vessels of war were anchored in the Tagus:Her Majesty's screw ships Duke of Wellington, RearAdmiral Sir R. C. Dundas; J ames Watt, Captain T. V. Anson; Princess Royal, Captain G. Giffard; and the French screw ship Austerlitz. Her Majesty's steamer Industry had arrived with stores for the squadron on the 13th, and left again for Plymouth on the 17th.
The weather had been very boisterous on the coast of Portugal. During the night of the llth'several small vessels broke their cables in the Tagus and were driven on shore; many of the large ones received very serious damages, as also did the lighters aud shore boats. Among the vessels wrecked on the coast, advices had been received of the total loss at Sinesl of the English schooners Nimroud, W. G. Tacker, of which one man perished, on the 9th, and Queen of the East, Wm. King, on the 10th. These two vessels had left Lisbon in ballast on the 5th, and were taking in cork for England. Near Faro the Rebreast, of Liverpool, Alexander Ross, had been driven on shore on the 11th after losing her masts at sea, as also three of her crew. She was bound from Cadiz to Liverpool, with a cargo of sherry wine, of which it was expected part would be saved.
The Lisbon exchanges for three months were quoted for this packet :-London, 534; Paris, 538; Amsterdam, 41k; Hamburg, 474; Genoa, 525. On London some transactions were effected at 53i, little money over; on Paris and Hamburg, at quotations, with money over; Genoa and Amster. dam, nominal.

A Murrain Approaching.
A MJZ7.RAIN APPROACHING.
TO THE, EDITOR OF THE TI=ES.
Sir,-A most fatal epidemic has been for some time past ravaging the herds of Central Europe, and has now reached Klonigsberg, where one proprietor is said to have lost 300 head in a night. The time of its arrival in Hamburg, whence cattle ar weekly imported to the English markets, must now, in all human probability, be but a question of days.
In 174e the same, or a like epidemic. " was introduced into England by means of two calves from Holland" (Vide Youaa on CacWe, Art. " Malignant Epidemic Murrain".) In thesecond year after its introduction over 40,000 cattle died in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, and almost as many more in Cheshire. During the third year remunera. tion was given by the Government, who had ordered the destruction of diseased cattle, for no fewer than 80,000 head, while twice as many more, awcording to the report of one of the commissioners, died o! the m.lady. In the fourth year it was equally fatal, ,nor does it appear to have completely disappeared till eight years after.
On the continent every exertion is being made to arrest the progress of infection by this exterminating disease; military detachments are charged to destroy all that become infected. In Prussia, if only one of a herd should be attacked, the authorities order the whole to be slaughtered; and cordons sanitatres are established along the frontiers to prevent the ingregs of cattle from districts in which the disease exists.
Happily, from their insadar posioion, there can be little difficulty, under Providenoe, in preventing its introduction iato these islands. It is only to lay an embargo on live cattle and raw hides, the produce of countries where this disease has already appeared. Should, notwithstr.nding the example of continental Governments, so obvious a precautionary measure be neglected, what a ferzful responsibility will be incurred by those in whose power it rests to enforce it
Imported live cattle form but a very fractional portion of our corsumption, and the embargo need not apply to cured meats or prepared leather.
I am, Sir, your obedient servants,

The Colliery Explosion near Barnsley.
Th COLL JRBY ZXPLOSIONewar BARNSLEY.
Yesterday Mr. T. Badger, coroner, opened an inquest oU the body of Abraham Turner, who was one of the men got out of the pit alive shortly after the accident on Thursday, and died on Saturday morning. The inquiry was opened at the house of the deceased, at Wath.
Tho proprietors of the pit were in attendance, as also Mr. C, Morton, the Government inspector. Mr. W. H. Peacock, solicitor, Barnsley, appeared on behalf of the proprietors, who, he stated, would have pleasure in rendering all the assistance in their power in the investigation of this deplorable accident.
The Coroner, in opening the inquiry, said he had had a
conversation with MIr. Morton, the Government inspector, I and thought it would be the best oourse to take some preli. minary evidence to-day and then adjourn the inquest for a wcek, by which time it was not improbable that a number of the bodies left in the pit would ba recovered. He was sure the jury would co-operate with him in fully, fairly, and patiently inquiring into all the circumstances of the dreadful calamity.
The following evidence was adduced
Mr. W. H. Peacock, of Barnsley, solicitor to the proprietors of the Lundhill CoUiery, said the namesof the proprietors of the pit were W. Taylor, of Redbrook, near Barnsley, Thomas S. Galland, of Brampton, barrister-atlaw, E. T. Simpson, of Walton, near Wakefield, soapmaker, and W. Stewart, of Wakefield, gentleman. Joseph Coe, of Hemingfield, is the underground steward.
Alice Turner, mother of the deceased, identified the body of the deceased as that of her son, who was 21 years of age, and was a hurrier in the Lundhil pit for his brother Stephen Turner. He went to work at the usual time on jhe morning of the explosion, and was brought home between 5 and 6 o'clock the same afternoon very much burnt. He died at half-past 4 o'clock on Saturday morning.
Wilfliam Colbridge, of Lundhill, fireman at the Lundhil Colliery, said,-I saw the deceased in the pit several times on Thursday. The explosion occurred about 20 minutes past 12 at noon. It was of a most serious character. I Was in the pit at the time, and got to the bottom as soon as I could. Abraham Turner came to the bottom an hour and a half after me. He complained of cold, and of being very badly burnt. I took off my jacket, and put it upon him. He sat beside myself and the other men until we wero drawn up. There were 15 or 16 of us when he arrived, and two or three others came afterwards. Nineteen were got out between 4 and 5 o'clock. Only two wero burnt, so far as I know-the deceased and Aaron Nixon Five of us were drawn up in the first draw, and six in the second. I and deceased were taken out by the second draw. When the explosion took place I was in the cabin which is 12 or 14 yards from the bottom of the drawing shaft, and five others were with me,-namely, Thomas Smith, Henry Chipchase, and Joseph Tumnercliffb, three hookers- on; ;Abraham Levitt, a packer ; and William Hartley, the horse-keeper. It was the dinner hour, which was the reason of our being there. There were five men and a boy on the dip side, about 130 or 140 yards from the pit bottom. Their names are Thomas Hammerton and his son, John Ellis, Edmund Simmons, Thomas Bell, and - }itching, and all of them were got out alive. George Warrender and Johrn Booth came from the north levels to the bottom. Aaron Nixon, who is a hurrier, was sitting on the top side of the pit bottom when the accident occurred. I went into the pit on Thursday morning at 4 o'clock, and w ent roundall the workings on the south and west sides of tbe pit, until I met William IUingworth, the other fireman, in the centre or furnace board. I found all the places I visited in excellent working order; thev were never better. WiUiam Ilflngworth had to examine the north levels and workings, and it was after he had done this that we met. It was near half-past 5 o'clock, It was my duty to examine the working parts of the pit before any of the miners were allowed to descend. No man was allowed to leave the bottom before we gave the signal.
Mr. Morton.-The rule is that they shall not descend until the examination is made.
Witness proceeded.-Some of the men have at times descended before we have completed our examination, but none of them were allowed to leave the bottom until we sWad all was ready.
By Mr. Morton.-From half-past 5 o'clock until noon I was employed in going round the workings on the north side, putting up brattices, and seeing that the men attended to their duty. I did not see any brattices put un in other parts that day. The battices were properly placed, and in what we called good working order.
The Coroner.-Can you form any opinion as to the cause of the explosion ?
Witness.-I cannot. It is supposed tlere are over 160 persons now in the pit. Naked candles were used in somi parts of the pit, and Davy lamps in other parts, where it was thought necessary to have them. Candles were in ge-neral use; we thought it safe to use candles. It was Part of my duty to order Davy lamps where I thought them necessary, aecording to rnle7,-namely, wherever there was fare,-and I attended to it. I did not orderDavy lamps to be used on Thursday last by the miners. The packers used them regularly. The lamps have locks, but are not alvays locked.
~- Mr. Morton.-That is contrary to rule ; they are required to be locked.
Examination continued.-I saw the packers using Davy lamps on Thursday as usuaL The lampkeepers are Joseph Grimshaw and Joseph Hartley.
John Warhurst, another fireman, said,-I was at home when the explosion occurred. I went there immediately afterwards. I found the chair for the corves was blown up into the head-gear. Power was applied to remove it, but without success, and the rope was cut as quickly as possible. We got into the pit as soon as we could ; it was about half-past 4 o'clock. I, Joseph Coe, and William Beevers were the first to descend. Some distance down we found two sheeting boards loose, and took them to the top of the pit. I and Beevers then went to the bottom, MIr. Coe having got out. As we descended we heard men at the bottom screaming for assistance. We found a number of men congregated at the bottom, and sent them out as soon as possible. I left a man named Hammerton assisting to get the men out and proceeded to look round. On reaching the cupola upeast shaft) I found that it was on fire about the furnace. found a man lying on a heap of burning coals, and took him off. I could only get a few yards further up the board-gate, as the fire-damp fired in my lamp. I returned into the level and there met with another dead body. Did not recognize either of them. Further on the south level I found a third and fourth body, after which Ireturned to the shaft not thin-ing it prudent to go further by myself. I ha gone 70 or 80 yards. I returned, went out and reported what I had seen toMr. Coe. Mr. Webster, Mr. Maddison, Mr. Utley, 3ir. Ellison,and Mr. Coo then went down the pit along viwth me. We went on the south side until we got between the second and third board-gate,where we found four or five more dead bodies. It was about 250 yards. The lamI showed fire, and we were afraid to go further lest it shoul
explode again. We returned to the shaft. I ascended and took some more men down. Mr. Coe and Air. Webster told me to take these men to the dead bodies and then return to them on the north side. After going to the dead bodies I and Benjamin Hoyland went as far as the fourth board-gate, which is 400 yards from the bottom of the pit. On account of the fire-dam p we could not go further. The bodies were taken to the bottom of the shaft by the men I had fetched down, after which I went to Mr. Webster on the north side. We found five or six more dead bodies near the end of this level. We found 15 or 16 bodies in all, but only removed about half of them to the bottom of the shaft. We did not remove them all to the bottom, because we were afraid the shafts would fall in, I went to the cupola and found the fire burning about 25 yards each way, and 1 went and told the other persons that the furnace would fall in. Indeed, I saw the arches of the furnace and some masses of burning coal fa from the sides of the drift leading to the furnace. I expected that if we remained we should all be killed, andthe other men were of the same opinion. I saw the stables on fire. We could not get to both ends of the stables, for the gas fired in the lamps about 30 yards up the north board. We went up every board, both north and south, as far as we could get. We found inflammable gas up every board. The greatest distance we got up any board was abou t 40 yards.
The Corener.-Can you form any opinion as to the cause of the accident 1
Witness.-I cannot form any opinion, unless it be that some trapper has left a door open in one of the boards. This is a mere supposition.
A conversation succeeded, daring which Mxr. Morton stated that he was afraid many of the bodies left in the pit would be very much burnt, and that he could not give an opinion as to when the pit would be reopened, as if it were reopened prematurely the fire would be ag,ain fanned into a flame, and a further explosion might result.
The inquest was then adjourned until Monday next at the Bull's Head Inn, Brampton.
SEIZURE OF A SLAVER.-Some time in the month
SEIZURE OF A SLAvER.--Some time in the month of December last a Caban or Spaniard arrived in this city from Havannah with a well-filled purse, the contents of which he intended to invest in the purchase of a cargo of "black ivory." Before he had eaten the first meal in his hotel his presence and intentions were known to some of the detectives attached to Uncle Sam's civil service, and a watch was set upon his actions. After some consultation with certain parties here, whose business mainly consists in advising adventurers of his class, the schooner Jane P. Glover, of Harwich, Massachusetts, was purchased, and the usual complement of water casks stowed in her hold. Having a coasting licence, she then put off for a certain pla,e on the Connecticut River, where she was to take in water, fearing detection should she attempt it here. After that she was to meet a sloop somewhere near Saybrook or Nev London, and receive from her the aptain, crew, and owner, together with the usal stores of beans, rice, castor oil, and other requisites for a trip o the African coast. These proceedings were all known to irhe authorities, but it was deemed advisable, in view of the riullin of the courts hereabout as to the amount of evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction, to give the negro-stealers a taste of Connecticut justice. By some means the information sent by Distrie+t-Attorney M'Keon to his colleague in Connecticut leaked out and after taking in her water the schooner got wind of tie chase and suddenly hove anchor and put off into the Soaad, whither the sloop followed her. Frigistened by the actioae of the Connecticut marshal, the schooner would not take hLer stores on board, and they were therefore brought to this port by the 6Ioop, surreptitiously transferred to the bark Pampillia, and are now probably in
vannah, or very nearly so, togetherwith the parchaser Of the echooner. After beatffng about for some time, the chooner returned to this port, and w.as lst week seized by order of District-Attorney M'l3eon s a; slaver.-.lYew YorA

Lyceum Theatre.
LYCEUM THEATRE.
The tendency of farce to throw off its pristine extravaganco and to settle down in the more polished form of petite comedie has received several checks of late. Two or three authors seem to have arrived at the conviction that the smile of approbation has too much encroached on the roar of absolute enjoyment, and that a little more nonsense infused in our lighter dramatic pieces would be equivalent to a little more spirit. Let not the reign of "neatness" and
smartness" be universal; let us have some of that element for which there is no other word but " fun."
Of the "fiLnny" reaction we have a striking specimen in a new farco written by Messrs. E. H. Yates and W. Harrington, and produced last night at the Lycenm, with the title ofAFrhendfrom Leatherhca4. Neverdid dramatist go more zealously to work for the promotion of "fun" in the most rigorous sense of that popular term than the authors of this piece. From no expedient have they flinehed. Probability has been to them a weak fence, to be broken down without remorse wherever a laughcould be gained by the work of destruction, and the notion of a4similating the stage to the conventionalities of life has been scorned with the most lordly disdain. There is defiance to rzrarn,zoancc in the very names of the dramatis .erson- Who in the world ever heard of a Captain Sqmufem, or a Mr. Loophole? And even if one coneedes the possibility of a Squiffem, how could Mrs. Squiffera have a maidservant named Lemondrop ?
Loophole's adventures are even more extraordinary than his name. Coming from Leatherhead, he has followed an unknown lady i Pegent's Park regularly every day forsomethinglieafortnight. His intentions have been matrimonial, but have given exceeding annoyance to the lady, who has communicated her grievance to her husband, Captain Squiffem. Now, it so happens that Loophole Is a particular friend of the galant Captain, who, on hearing of his arrival in town, asks him to dinner, and while they are chatting together before their meal the conversaticn turns on the Giovanni of the Regent's Park, whom the Captain intends to call out and shoot. Poor Loophole, who at once perceives that his friend's wife is the fair incogni4, is in an agony of terror, and resolves to return to Leatherhead without delay. Should Mrs. Squiffem set her eyes upon him he would be undone. His first expedient is anoffertotakethe Captain's challenge to the offending party, which be hinmself dictates with as much presence of mind as he can commard. *With this billet he can accom-
Ilish a " bolt," but the Captain maost inconvenienitly recol. Fets tbat he does not know th.e nam°e of the offending partc, and rushes off to make inquiries, fastening Loophole ii the room to prevent his pursiat. Mrs. Squiffem is inthe adjoining apartment; Loophole peeps at her through the door, and feels that a meeting is inevitable. He thereforeconstretsfor himself a skirt out of a chair cover, puts Mrs. Squiffem's shawl, with the wrong side foremot, across his shoulders, aces on his head the same lady's fashionable bonnet, having turned it inside out toprevent recognition, and with a sofa-pilow in his arms, to represent an infant, boldly informs rs. Squiffem thet he is Shanks, the footman's wife, crueUy abandoned by her husband. This ruse prodaces a storm of rage and grief from the maidservant, temondrop who is the footman's sweetheart,and while that sentimentai damsel has gone to fetch the faithless Shanks, in order to confront him with his injured spouse, the frail articles of Loophole's female attire give way, and he stands revealed to Mrs. Squiffem as her persecutor of the Regent's Park. He now attempts to take refuge in a passionate declaration of love, but all in vain, and he would receive a hearty thrashing from the indignant Shanks did he not effect his escape by a desperate leap from the window into the roof of a greenhouse. When he reappears, to the astonishment of Captain Squiffem, who has returned home immediatelyafterthiscrisis,heisequipped in an armour of earthenware, with an arm through one flowerpot and a leg through another. His terror is now more frantic than ever, but his old friend is kind enough to laugh at his mistEortunes and shke him by the hand in token of forgiveness.
The character of Loophole is arduous to the last degree, and the manner in which it wM played by Mr. Toole cannot fail to enhance his reputation, e threw himself heart and soul into all the violence of the soene, thus oing through a considerable amount of physical hard work, while in the
uieter portions he assumed the tone of a conceited gent," with a great deal of humour. Shanks, the footman, and Lemondrop, the maidservant, are written up to the highest pitch of extravagance, anid were acted with smtable spirst by Mr. Holston and MLiss Wilton, especiaUy the latter, whose screams and faintings are marvellous. The lady and the Captain were represented inbecoming style by Mrs. B. White and lr. J. G. Shore, who, by the way, is fast losing his character of a novice, and has become a very sensible actor in those quiet gentlemanlike parts which, though when well done, they oxcite but moderate applause, are especially liable to ridicule if clumsily executed.
Aiming at a hearty roar, the authors have reaped their reward. The sound of laughter rolled unceasingly through the whole course of the piece, and shouts for those who had caused it followed the fall of the curtain.
CRUELTY TO CHILDREN.-We stated in The Times
COnuTY TO CnflDRn= .-We stated in The Times of Friday that an inquest had been held at Dawlish, Devonshire, oni the body of a girl, aged 14, whio was allegea to have died through the i-treatment' which she received from her father, a shoemaker named Newberry. The coroner's jury did not consider the evidence sufficient to justify them in returning a verdict of manslaughter, but requested the coroner, Mr. W. A. Cockes, to censure Newberry for his brutal conduct to the poor child. Since then the magistrates for the division have caused him to be apprehended, and on Saturday, after hearing evidence, they committed him for trial at the ensuing assizes on the charge of manslaughter.
TIIE CivL SmRviCx.-The second report of ller Majesty's Civil Service Commissioners came out yesterday in the form of a large blue-book. The repoit is partly the continuation of a narrative of proc_edings since tray, 1835. The object of the examinations is-1. To test the candidate's actual fitness for his duties and 2, to test his education and inteligence generaUy. fihe ntuber of candidatesupon whose cases the commissioners adjndicated from the 21st of May, 1855, to the 31st of December, 1856, was 3,004. Of these 60 were extra amtcm, 12 physically incompetent, 10 devoid of satisfactory evidence as to character, 99 admitted without examination (on reports from heads of departments), and 137 either declined to undergo the examination or withdrew without completing it. Of the remaining 2,686 adctually examined, 1,587 p'pi'.ed, and obtained certificates of qualification, 880 were rejected, and 219 were unsuccessful
upon competition. Thus, the rejections were in the ratio of 351 per cent. on those actuaUy examined (not counting the unsuccessful competitors). In the seven months ended December, 1855, the ratio was 29-5 per cent. Out of the 880 candidates thus dismissed it is reported that no less than 425were turned back for bad speUing alone, or with other subjects, except arithmetic; 147 for arithmetic alone, or with other subjects, except orthography; and 243 for speling and arithmetic, with or without other subjects; so that only 65 have been rejected since the commissioners commenced their duties for deficiencies not involving speUing or arithmetic, or both. For four situations (three of them junior clerkships and one a senior clerkship of 2001. to 3001 a-year) there were 46 competitors, incluing 28 sons of professional men and independent gentlemen; 26 of the candidates had already been eugaged in some definite occupation - 25 out of the 46 had finished their education at one or other of the univerities or colleges of London, and 16 of the remaining 21 were educated at public or grammar schools. A large proportion of the candidates gave evidence of considerable iniformation and ability, and the four sucoessful ones have been tried and not found wanting. Preious specimens are given in the appendix of the orthography, or rather the cacography, of rejected candidates:-"Beauty" is spelt "beaughty ;" "Blenheim," "Blennemm," "bowels," "bowls;" "confederacies," " confedrises ;" "character," "charik-tar-" "cavaliers," "caveleirs;"J "credulity," "credualty,"' "injura," " ingure; " " into," "intoe ;" "elements,"
elliments ;" " neighbour," "nabour-" "monks," "pmnks,"php her" ,"pholisper;", " pane ricsaX "warmth " 1 walmth ;. and the like.
CHN;.-Yesterday appeared two Parliamentary documents on the relations of England with China. The first is a blue-book of 200 pages, headed " Insultsin China," and contains avoluminous official correspondence respecting insults offered by British residents at Canton to natives of that place, or by Chinese to foreigners, since the treaty of peace in 1842. The correspondence extends from the 20th of December, 1842, down to the Sth of December, 1856, the last datefrom China occurring on the 8th ofOctoberlast. The second paper contains correspondence relative to the entrance into Canton between October, 1850, and July, 1855, at which latter date Sir J. Bowring, in a formal letter to Yeh, referr.1d with ?afin to the unsatisactory state of affairs, and expressed his regret that his earnest desire to establish and strengthen amicable relations was not adequatey appeciatd by ' Ex ellny.

General Statement of the Company's busines firom 1846 to 185.
1.s0nus years.
The Directors had alto the pleasure of submnitting to tho meeting various statistical detaus and calculations a to the expectedand aetnei mortiaty of the last year. showing that in Scotland and England, also in Ireland, the resultshave been most favourable, the Company having made provision for a much larger number of deaths than have occurred-thus illustrating the advantage arising from dealing witha select class of business only.
Tbe report then proceededas follows
"From the extent of the businets of 1855, the Bonus year, it was not anticipated that the year 1186 would be so prosperous as it has proved; hut the popularity of the Company has not flagged, and 18
has shown resuits which must be highls satisfactory to au interested in the institution. This popularityarisesfromvarionscauses:-Thu prudent character of the management, the sound principles on which the Company's affairs are periodically investigated, and the lage reserve of profits. All these, no doubt, tend to secure to the Standard a mome than ordinary share of preference; but the Directors claim also, without fear of usurping what is due to othes, the merit of having introduced maty liberal conditions into the contract of assurance, whvich have done much to ive it increased luoe and stability, and which cannot fail to have added totho Company's wellearnea fame. Tho extended license as to foreign residence and the indefeasiblity of policiea admitted to the select class of aesuronces, also the sew resolutions of last year as to tho non-forfeituro of asuranes, are all snufcient evidence in proofof this asertion,"
The Chairman thent addressed the meeting, and congrqtulatede alu iuteresd in the Institutlon on the satisfactory progress ond state ot the Companys affairs, illustrating his observations by the following facts :
The amount of ssuraoces asoDcted duritng the last ten yars
amounted to £4787 301 MISa d., contained in 8,390 Pllicies,
The sum added to theCompany'srnvested. Fund d!Vgs the sam.
