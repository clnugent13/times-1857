Saturday Rvenlnr.
Although the Bank return published thiB morning, ovrz the bullion to have fallen to a point lower ;an at any period since November, 1847, when the Fate of discount was 8 per cent., no unfavourable ietwas produced on the funds, its general features aving been anticipated. Consols for money opened st the closing price of Thursday, 92j to i, and in consequence of several purchases improved to 921 to i, at which they remained to the termination of bueiness. ?For the 7th of May the la3t transactions 'were at 93i to i. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 91i to i ; New Three per Cents., sit to i; Echequer-bonds, 98i to ; ; India-bonds, '4s. to 2s. discount; and Exchequer-bills (Maroh), 2a. discount to 2s. premium.
In the discount-market to-day the demand was moderate.
There have been no further gold withdrawala from the Bank, and it is expected that a considerable portion of the 340,0001. brought from Australia by the Simla, Copenhagen, and Brilliant vwill be retained here.
Foreign securities have not greatly varied, the operations having been limited. Turki-sh Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 94i and iex div., and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 1002. The other operations comprised-Sardinian Five per Cents 90; Spanish Certificates of Coupon, not funded, 64; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. SOc. for money, and 69f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing a further recoverpy of a quarter per cent.
The Paris letters mention that the subscription list of M. Mlires for the Roman railways (Rome to Civita Vecchia, Rome to Ancona, Ancona to Bologna, and Bologna to Ferrara) has been filled, and that the shares are now at a premium. The amount is nearly 3,000,0001., and there is a guarantee of 6 per cent. from the Papal Governmaent. The shares were allotted at par, with "a commission of 2 per cent. in favour of the bankers."
According to the telegraphicadvices fromrIndia to-day the rates of exchange do not appear to have become less unfavourable. Indeed, at Calcutta there seems to have been a further advance of 1 per cent. The pressure in the money-market both at Bombay and Calcutta has, however, in some degree subsided.
The railway meetings of the week have presented few facts of interest. The shareholders of the Great Western of Canada Company have adopted the report and confirmed the dividend at the rate of 9I per cent. per annum. The report of the Fife and
tinross Railwvay has been agreed to, and it is stated that the works are making satisfactory progress. The first section of the Pernambuco Railway will be opened considerably within the period allowed by the contract, and the prospects of the undertaking continue to be regarded as favourable. According to a statement made by Mr. De Mornay, the Imperial Government, as 'well as the authorities and population of the province, continue desirous to afford it every encouragement. The report oI the Wellington and Severn Junction Company states that the route between Ketley and Horsehay is completed and ready for traffic. In order to avoid the expense of providing working stock and locomotive power, the directors have entered into negotiations with the Great Western Company, -which, when settled, will it is thought form the basis of a satisfactory arrangement. The dividend ahown by the accounts of the Paris and Orleans Company is 54f. per share, making, with the 30f. already paid, 84f. for 1850, or 161. 16s. per cent.
Tle report of the Roy'al Mail Steam Company, issued preparatory to their meeting on the 16th, recommends, in ad.lition to the usual dividend of 21. per share for the half-year ending December last, a bonus of 11. l0s., free of income-tax, out of the surplus of the insurance fund. The general accounts for the past year show a variety of alterations as compared with 1855, consequent principally upon the cessation of the transport service. In the receipts from the ordinary sources of traffic there has been an increase of 51,5411. Since the failure of Messrs. Copland, Barnes, and Co., the company have resolved to undertake themselves the provisioning of their fleet. With regard to the straiding of the Tyne, it is believed that the entire loss consequent upon that disaster will be fully covered by the sum appropriated to insurance for the first half of the current year, viz., 22,5001. She is expected to resume the service in October next, and to prove as good a vessel as she was before she grounded.
Letters from Hamburg reiterate that the order in Council prohibiting the importation of foreign (c ttle from the Baltic ports will be totally ineffectlve. All cattle, it is observed, can be sent by rail to Hamburg, of course passing through Mecklenburg, where the disease is raging. The whole of the Baltic ports have but to send their cattle to Echleswig, and export from Tonning, or they may land them in Kiel and forward them to HIamburg. According to late accounts the disease is very bad in HoLstein.
In a pamphlet on Savings Banks Reforms,* addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. C. W. Sikes, of the Huddersfield Banking Company, after recapitulating the imperfections inthe management of these institutions which have resulted in the Government being liable for a deficiency of between 3,000,0001. and 4,000,0001., and an unprogressive condition of most of them, owing to the guarantee of the State being incomplete and deceptive, advocates the following improvements, viz. :-That the guarantee should henceforth be perfect; that there should be a head bank in London to control the whole system; that there should be a vigilant and ge9Lral audit; that there should be a great extension of the hours during which savings banks are open, an increase in the number of banks, the services of private and joint-stock banks being used in cases where they might prove economical and advantageous, and an augmentation of the facilities for the deposit and withdrawval of money; that one-fourth of the capital should be employed in firstclass landed securities and railway mortgage bonds yielding 4 per cent.; that there should be an uniform rate of interest to depositors of 3 per cent. upon sums up to 1()01., and 2i on all.'beyond; that the deficiency now existing on the savings banks' account should be closed by a creation of stock to the requisite amount, and that a periodical return chould be made of aU deposits and depositors, classified respectively into occupations and amounts. The most essential point is that the Government guarantee should for the future be unquestionable, and this is already known to be contemplated by the Chancelor of the Exchequer. The other alterations suggested seem generay sound and practicable, and would help to form the basis of a system that would restore savings banks to the estimation in wlhich they were held during the first 20 years of their existence.

MANCHESTER, APnm U.
The market has not been well attended, many of the buyers and sellers usually present having left town for the Easter holydays; but there was some business done in yarns suited to manufacturing purposes and for export, to the Continent. MIost spinners being now free from stocl, aid some tolerably well supplied with orders, they decline contracts, except at f nl rates, and prices are stiU in favour of the seller. In clothe there is not much business in the better classes of printers and T cloths; but the lower qualities of the fonner and tho medium makes of the latter continue in request, with stocks pretty well cleared. For 40-inch shirtings there is a moderate but steady demand at last prices.

The ironmasters' meetings for the quarter concluded at Dudley this evening; the proceedings are stated to havo passed off satisfactorily, and the resolutions adopted at the previous meetinRs to maintain the rates of last quartor wera fully confirmed.
The occurrence of Good Friday interfered with the umal meeting of coal and mine propnetors at Stourbridge; bat business had in some degree been anticipated at the earlier meetings of the week, and, in consequence, less inconvenience was experienced than otherwise would have been the case. Good stone is firm in price, and in considerable request.
The ironfounders of the district are moderately well employed, aad many of them have entered into new contracts for the supply of manufactured iron for use during tbe next quarter at existing quotations. Some of the large railway companies have advertised for extensive tenders for the supply of rails, nd these propective orders, combined with large foreign demands for similar purposes, render this branch of the iron trade firm, if not more than ordinarily
No alteration has yet been announced in the prioes of metals used in the chief staple manufactures of Birmingham, although it has been stated that copper in large parcels, in consequence of a marked reduction in the home consumption, may be purchased at somewhat lower rates than at present exacted. The market is unquestionably esier; but the generality of the founders will not buy more than they absolutely require for present use.
The demand for general hardware oontinues active, and the factors represent that, with the exception of articles affected by the extraordinary advance of materials, the orders for ironmongery are the average, if not more than the average, of this season of the year.
The chief business of the weekin Birmingham has been the settlementof quarterly accounts, andatno formerperlodhave they been discharged with greater promptitude and alacrity. The attempts in some of the towns of the district to postpone payments until next week, on the ground that quarterdays were only then legitmately due,were not made in this town bhut all houses fully recognized the days fixed by the meeting of associated ironmastersa
NOTTINGHAM, Apinl1L
Business is rather dull in both the lace and hosiery branches. The holydays have prevented the home trade buyers from presenting themse7ves in the warehouses and the Americans who have been here have done but little, in oonsequence of the ruling high prices and the extreme rates of discount.
LEICESTERt, APm II.
The hosiery trade In most of Its branches oontinues quiet, but manufacturers are anticipating a teacion after aLster. 'Upon the whole machinery is tolerably well employed. Wools and yarns are high.
The inactivity reported in the woollen cloth trade for the t few weeks still continues. In the warehouses there Iastsll little doing, and the few orders on hand are chiefly for the country. The tightness of the money-market, the high value of wool, and the ungenial character of the weather have combined to prevent speculation, and have certainly had no tendency to promote a wholesome briskness. The cloth-hals this morning were but indifferently attended and the transactions were on a very limited scale. In addition to the general caution that is manifested the present holyday season has also, as is usual at such periods, had a temporary effect upon the cloth business. There are, however, no serious grounds for fear as to the future prospecots o f the trade, and hopes are entertained that a reaction wFill shortly take place.
BRADFORD, AP=n U.
The worsted trade has relapsed into a state of dulness. I had har ily recovered from the inanition prevalent during the elections, which occurred between "the seasons" in the worsted district, when the temporary improvement was checked by the advance in the rate of discount, in addition to which the continued broken weather hereabouts ex
rienced has a prejudicial effect on business. In piece goos, thorefore, there are very few transactions entered into, either at market or in the warehouses (in the latter stocks are anything but extensive), and manufacturers await the appearance.of more brilliant weather before they can experience the commencement of the demand in the home houses for goods suited to the fall, and which the present disproportionate cost of the raw material precludes them from producing into stock on speculation.
Yarns are in the unsatisfactory condition lately reported. The figures offered for worsted yarns are so profitles that spinners are prevented from accepting orders for most quali. ties except at a positive loss; this branch of the trade is therefore exceedingly inanimate, bothfor home use and ship. ping purposes. The business doing in cotton warps also participates in the general quietness.
Wools suited to combing purposes meet vith a fair inquiry ; the actual business done, however, is only to a moderate extent, transactions as a general rule being merely restlicted to such quantities and assortments as are required for the completion of contracts. Fine long-stapled descrip
tions maintain their firmness in Price, and stocks in the hands of staplers, although slowly increasing, are beneath the average at this season. There is no change to report in clothing wools.
The inactivity which has characterized the trade of this dislrict since the dissolution of Parliament still prevails, and the prospects for the future are not at present favourable. The increase of the rate of discount has tended stil further to check the demand. There is but a moderate inquiry for pieces, and great unwillingness to accede to the rates asked by the manufacturers. The yarn-market is also dull, and, as the spinners cannot obtain rates corresponding with the cost of production, they are, in many cases, running only part of their machinery. Thore is httle doing in Iwool, and no alteration in prices.
BELFAST, A.Pu 10.
Linen.-At the various country markets brown linens were in fair demand, at previous rates. In Lurgan, owing to small supplies, prices were rather dearer for al descrip. tions. For white linen there has been a good consumptive demand, and the export trade is good.
Linen yarn meets a fair demand, at former rates.
Plax.-Supplies continue to fall off at the country markets; prices are, however, a shade lower. In foreign flax little passing.
Cotton.-The local firms engaged in printing cotton and linen fabrics are all in f ull work, and any small stocks wf such goods an in the hands of the large houses. The agents of Scotch houses located in the north of Irela, I thingh not so busy as usual, are is pretty fair work, -..ve labour to a great number of weavers.

Alternate rain ann sumnne have had a forcing effect upon vegeta tion, and the season altogether is as propitious as oould he deelred fo, the growing crops. Wheat is lookingpartloularly promiding, and tha seed paaturage isunusually abundant. All field operations, however, are backward, owtug to the protraoted wet weather.
The wheat trade in this locality haragain hada downward tendency, lest week's prices being maintained in only a few instances; bat seUers have reused to make any zeduction exoeeding Is. on the better samples, and the trade on the whole has been limited, Barley has also further declined in value to the extent of Is to 2s., the abunr dace or good seed and malting samples brought forward, contrary to g neral oxpectation at this advanced erod ofite seaon, having hd a dOpresUing ffet upon the trrAe.

A labourer living in L- L- called upon me and said, that I had better look after the rough music they were giving X-, or some mxichief would came of it.
I inquired, "What is it all about?"-" Oh, you had better see into it yourself, for I don't like to have anything to do with such things."
I accordingly walked up to x-'s house, and asked him if he had anything to oomplain of I-" Yes, a pretty deal; and Ill be blowed if I don't do for some on 'em."
" Don't take the law into your own hands, but trust to me and you shall bo protected. Bat what is it all about ?'"Oh, some nonsense they talks on about E-'s wife."
" What have you been doing 'a wife E"-" Why, nothing at all; IhaVnt een the woman this twelvemouth."
"EHave you had any dispute with her husbandP'-" Oh, there was a few words about a little job I did for himmending his dungspit, bat that's all right."

London, Monday, April 13, 1857.
LONDON, MONDAY, APRIL 13,1857.
Among the exploded plans for the realization of Utopia is the settling of the poor on the waste places of the earth by the paternal authority of the State. Poets once sang of the time when every ;ood, of land, maintained its man, and more ambitious theorists had visions of the whole human race united, civilized, and parcelled out on plots of 50 acres to a family. It is easy to laugh at these fancies, but the truth lies somewhere between them and the strange disproportion which now exists in the population of different parts of the globe. Emigration has indeed done much lately. It has relieved England, regenerated and tranquillized Ireland, added strength to the tide of progress in the United States, developed Canada, and founded new commimities in Australia. But more remains to be done. Enterprise and progress are merely comparative, and, though statesmen may rejoice at the contentment of the mother country, and travellers tell vwith admiration of the triumphs of industry in the New World and the Antipodes, we can hardly be satisfied as long as we hear of the unceasing demand for labour in those new regions, and see meagre countenances, sullen looks, and ragged garments at home. England and the New World, England and Australia, are now so much one in interests, habits, and feeling that we can hardly look upon the departure of a workman and his family with the old spirit. Formerly there was something of regret aroused by the sight of such bands of exiles. They were so many taken from -the population of England, they were so many added to the numbers of a people who were rivals, a1nd- ight any day be enemies, or they went to recruit colonies where disaffection reigned unchcked and the separation of which from the yArent State might shortly follow. But the rei6ted attacbment of the British colonies and the morb .micable terms on which we are with the Tiitead Stateo have caused thes little jealousies to cease, amind we now feel that the emigrant is one #ho inedy- irnsifers his labour from one to *Uother of the regions inhabited by the saume Anglo-Saxon community. The assistance given
by the Government to emigration is probably. sufficient. It would, no doubt, be an unjust and dangerous policy to carry men, their wives and children, across the ocean at the expense of those who must remain behind, and the State doea its part when it encourages the movement by making the acquisition of land in the colonies easy, giving free government to the settlers, and superintending the conveyance of the emigrants from these shores. We do not wiah, therefore, to urge the Government or the nation in its corporate capacity to do more for the distribution of our redundant population. But we would speak to individuals, to the men of humanity and of enterprise, to the charitable societies throughout the kingdom, and, above all, to the poor and struggling themselves. Emigration should be, as it has been, the voluntary work of the people; but, while approving and advocating the system already adopted, we would gladly see it systematized in its machinery and extended in its action.
No one can fail to have been affected by the accounts of destitution in the metropolis during the last three or four months. We saw gatherings of suffering multitudes, angry sometimes, turbulent sometimes, yet generally patient with all the sorrowful patience of the poor. We heard their doleful chant in the streets, or read the sad narratives of their speakers in the daily press. The sudden cessation of the war and the stagnation of certain channels of trade had brought upon us again a social calamity from which it was thought the nation was likely to be free. The distress which marked more than one year at the beginning of the present reign was renewed in 1857, as a lesson to us not to be too vain of progress nor too sanguine as to the eradication of inveterate evils. It is proved that at any time a high price of provisions or tbe stoppage of the activity of the country may reduce large bodies to destitution, which is only less dangerous than in former times because the public has been, by a process of wise legislation, enlisted on the side of order. Yet there is reason to be cheerful. The disease in our times is recurrent and local, and not chronic. On the whole, pauperism is, in comparison with population, steadily diminishing. Themetropolis has been the principal seat of the late distress, and yet for many parishes within its limits the amount expended on the relief of the poor is less for the year ending Lady-day, 1856, than for the year ending Lady-day, 1855. It is true that the total exhibits a slight increase for the latter year, being, according to a recent return, 875,2641., against 841,3021.; but this is easily accounted for by the higher price of provisions and the natural increase of the capital. This last consideration ought not to be disregarded, since it is recorded that the total amount received from Poorrates rose in the course of a year from 1,250,7371. to 1,360,4641. We believe that the number of ablebodied paupers was smaller in proportion to population during the latter of these two years than at any former time. Thus there is sufficient proof of the two propositions which we wish to establish-that emigration has succeeded in greatly diminishing distress among the working class, and that to carry it out on an extended scale at the approach of an industrial crisis is the best means of meeting the coming evil.
With regard to the prospects of the labourer in the New World and Australia, it is almost needless to repeat the oft-told tale. However, we may say that, according to the best informed correspondents of the latest dates, there is a steady and unceasing demand for all kinds of industry. In Australia the unskilled labourer earns Ios. a-day, while provisions are not immoderately dear. 1But, of course, it is only the comparatively -well off who can hope to reach the Antipodes. The great number of the houseless, penniless, families which are seeking work and finding none must be content with being landed in the St. Lawrence or on the quays of New York. To America, then, we may confine our remarks. The British colonies, particularly Western Canad, are now running a race in activity and enterprise with the most progressive States of the Union. Here artisans and mechanics, carpenters, bricklayers, blacksmiths, together with farm labourers and servants, can obtain immediate employment at wages which would be looked upon as fabulous in
England. The distance is of no importance; | the cost of transport is comparatively small. The climate is healthy, the people are our own flesh and blood, the emigrant is among his own kin, and hears the English language spoken on every side. The colony will not only receive him, but is, in fact, begging him to come. Can he hesitate? Here in England what has he ? Only the four walls of his one miserable room, shared by his wife and children, and perhaps by other tenants, a prey to similar misfortunes or perhaps steeped in crime. Though honest, he must perforce be the associate of the burglar or the footpad, and see his wife lose graduaUly all sense of decency by unavoidable intercourse with the most abandoned of her sex.
In a colony he may hope for an immediate and comfortable subsistence, and look forward to a competence after a few years' successful exertion. In the United States a similar welcome awaits him. We learn that in spite of the enormous imnigration of the last ten years there is still a demand for every kind of labour. We would especially call attention to the fact that female labour, which is so ill paid at home, is called for from all parts of the Northern States. "The chief cause of " domestic misery, " we were recently told, " is a "lack of servants." Here is a means of doing good which might be seized by the philanthropist. If anything more than another is calculated to make the unre'lecting grave, the selfish pitiful, and the sanguine desponding, it is the frightful condition of large classes of women in this country. Without entering into the question of morality, we may say that the fact that thousands of girls are rising yearly into womanhood without the means of keeping body and soul together by honest employment is one of the most terrible which can be contemplated. When we consider the condition of what are called servants of all work, the condition of seamstresses, shoebinders. and
the rest of the class of women who have to earn their own living, can we wpnder that the streets are nightly crowded with unfortunates in a manner which surprises every foreigner who visits our shores ? If men are temporarily or locally in distress, women by the million are always so. If men are forced into crime by lack of employment women are forced to lead a life of shame because the employment which they can obtain does not suffice to afford them subsistence. If men need to be aided in their misfortunes, much more should the helping hand be held out to women. If the younger women of the lower classes could be sent out from their parishes before they have been drawn into the horrible vortex of town profligacy, there would be a better prospect of diminishing the greatest of our social evils by stopping the supply of destitution which has so long fed it.
Society, like the private individual, has its
Society, like the private individual, has its grievances-certain old-established sores, any ausiou to which is sure to escite general sympathy in aU companies. The extortions of cabmen, inn charges, rates and taxes,-any reference to these veteran impositions kindles a spark of genial hoatility in every circle. Every one has ad bhis particular collision with these offensive claims, and has his story to tell. Thoso compositions called
Eerwon belong to.this clasn of veteran grievances. An allusion to them Will revive a drooping conversation, and awaken a spirit of rebellion in every breast. Everybody has suffered from this quarter, and a long vista of recollection opens out before every eye the retrospect of a yoke long borne,-the image of youraelf sitting in a pew or stall after or before an anthem, with a look of calm resignation, which vaguely betrays, however, tho general impression that something or otherwe do not say what-will be over in half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, or even an hour, from the present moment. A series of tableaux representing yourself in formal relations with a sounding-board is produced by the machinery of the brain. The relation is one of temporary subjugation. There are one or two others near you with the same nixed expression that you have yourself, indicative of transient and bearable adversity. The sky is lowering overhead, but the horizon is clear. We will not call this " smiling " at grief," because, to say the truth, the attitude of the figures is rather too comfortable to be sentimental. It is unnecessary to say what sympathy the sme pictorial representation per. vading the whole company creates. "A fellow" feeling makes uLs wondrous kind." It is, indeed, curious to observe the extraordinary difficulty which some of our most respectable writers-nay, our ablest moralists, seem to have had in encountering this particular ordeaL Dr. Jonxsox repented, most sincerely and devoutly, but still annually, over his very rare use of this great opportunity and privilege. We hardly know whether it is fair to notice the same delinquency in the valetudinarian CoslMDGE. Certainly, to hear the remarks that are generally made, a good preacher does seem to be a very rare production, and to require the lantern of DIoGr?Es to discover him. The fact of the excessive dulness of sermons beingindeedtakenfor granted, people are lost in perplexity how to accouat for it. Do the Canons require it ? Do the Bishops enjoin it ? The evil is altogether mysterious, and broods over the public like a nightmare. Its origin, like that of the source of the Nile, is unknown. Is it the result of volcanic influences? Will the same discovery explain it that will some day explain the phenomenon of the tides ? Or does the enigma await a meteorological solution ? There appears also to be something mysterious in the sensations of the sufferers. Language can give the superficial characteristics of what is experienced, but there seems to be something at the bottom which is indescribable. In fact, the whole thing is very mysterious, and we feel out of our depth when we attempt to penetrate it analytically. But, as metaphysicians say, the facts of consciousness in this department are plain, and so long as we keep quite close to them we feel ourselves tolerably safe.
Now, umdoubtedly preachers have something to say on their side of the question. As a class of public exhibitors they labour under peculiar difficulties. For example, a good lecture and a good theatrical piece can be repeated, and we have Mr. ArBFnT Sm and the orsican Brothers night after night. But a good sermon has only one existence. It goes off like a rocket, and disappears for ever. The preacher cannot advertise a second delivery. If it takes place it is by stealth. But success is not so frequent that it can afford this waste and extravagance without serious results. In other departments the failures escape notice, because they are merely tentative, and are withdrawn as soon as they are discovered not to take, while one good hit is hammered for months running into the public mind. In the case of sermons good and bad are on the same exhibitory level, and human nature is pinned forcibly to its average mark.
The reputation, however, of this class of compositions being thus low, it is not surprising if the sudden phenomenon of a monster preacher excites some astonishment, and if our correspondent, " HEAuBITA&S IN SICco," regcets that the Church has not the benefit of similar services, it is quite natural to ask why should such demonstrations be confined to Dissent ? Why cannot the Church have a monster preacher drawing his crowds?
PhysicalUy speaking,there can be no reason why the Church should not have, at any rate once or twice in a generation, a natural orator in its clerical ranks endowed with a voice as loud as Mr. SPunGEEoX's, and, if she has, there can be no cogent reason why she should not use him. A loud voice is a decided gift, an endowment; it may be thrown away in the prodigality of nature upon a man who has no purpose to turn it to, no thought to utter from that splendid organ; upon a man, in fact, who is a mere pompous STErTon in a pulpit; but give it to one who has thought and a purpose, and see the effect. It collects a crowd to listen, but that is only the first step. Another crowd comes because there is a crowd to begin with, and a third follows the second. But this is not aL A multitude listens with a different feeling to a speaker from that with which a roomfull of people or a churchfull of people listen, for the multitude fedes itself a multitude; it is conscious of its numbers, and every individual partakes in sorae degree the gigantic vibrations of the mass. The addition of power which is thus gained is immense, and, therefore, how is it that the Church never has a monster preacher ?
The reason is, that a loud voice requires its proper material to exert itself upon. The voice is notoriously tlle most sympathetic thing in nature. It cannot be loud and soft indiscriminately. Some things are made to be shouted, and others to be whispered. Nobody shouts out an axiom in mathematics; nobody balances probabilities in thunder,-Nemo consilium cztm clamore dat. There must be a strong sentiment, some bold truth, to make a man shout. In religion there must be something rather extravagant in the shape of doctrine. The doctrine of sudden conversion or of irresistible grace can be shouted, but if a man tried ever so hard to shout in delivering a moderate and sensible doctrine on freewill he would find himself talking quietly in spite of himself. A loud voice, then, must have " loud" doctrine to develope it. But the Church of England has rather a distaste for " loud"
doctrine; her general standard is opposed to it, her basis is a balanced one, mixing opposite truths, and qualifying what she teaches with judicious protests and disclaimers. She preaches Catholicity with a protest against Rome, and Protestantiam with a protest against Geneva. This is very sensible and very true, but it is not favour. able to popular preacbing. Of the two parties into which she is divided, one thinks it wrong to shout, as being against the principle of reverence. This school specially contrasts itself in this respect with the " rade world," which is supposed to be always shouting and doing everything that is noisy and vulgar, and with heretics who are audacious and immodest; and it plumes itsef on its refinement and good taste in the delivery of religious truth, which it thinks ought to be done in a sort of veiled and fragmentary way, so as to reach the sensitive ears of the good, and pass over those of the profane. All this is very excellent and refined, but it is against popular preaching. So much for one party. The other party might spealk loud if it liked; it has no theory against it, and its doctrines admit of it, but it does not like the trouble. And beside4 this party, though it professedly holds strong doctrine, practically tempers it considerably, -and bends to the moderate standard of the
Thus, what with the fear of criticism, the
deference to a recognized standard, idleness, reverence, and a great many other things-what with some thinking it heretical to shout and others thinking it unpolite to be popular-there is no monster preaching in the English Church. It does certainly admit of a question whether in our general policy we amc not overcautious, and gain greater theoretical correctness at the cost of much practical efficiency. It admits of a question whether a little extravagance and a little onesidedness might not be tolerated for the sake of a good, substantial, natural, telling appeal to the human heart. We should have no objection, for our part, to an Evangelical clergyman, with a strong voice, doing what Mr. SPunaEoN does. The doctrines of the two are in reality much the same, and, that being the case, why should fear of criticiEm prevent the Evangelical school from makdng themselves as effective as they can ? But such is the influence of a conventional standard, which, like conscience, " makes cowards "Cof us all."
It would form a subject of interesting contrast
It would form a subject of interesting contrast if the constitutionx severally assigned to a wellappointed Army in each of the four last centuries were placed aide by side with the patterns in favour at present. Unhappily this is a department of seience which has never remained stationary. The art of war has always been a progressive art, generally owing its advances to master spirits who, like GusTAvus A>oLrus, FREDBBTCE THE GBIAT, and NAPOMLEON BoxAPAnTE, improved at intervals upon the principles they found established, and left their systems of organization to stand until some new genius or fresh invention arrived to supplant them. As a matter of course, the chief reforms have arisen out of the lessons of actual experience, and the remodelling of Armies has almost invariably formed the sequel of some great war. Thus, the campaigns in the Crimea have suggested changes inthe administration and arrangements of our own forces; and we have recently reported the reorganization of the Russian Army in certain remarkable respects. Among the changes thus announced appears the dissolution of a large force of Dragoons which had been maintained as a distinct body; and we are further apprised that an extraordinary number of Rifle Battalions created by successive augmentations during the present and preceding reigns have now been attached to the various divisions comprised in the numerous hosts of the OzAa.
The first of these incidents is perhaps the less important inasmuch as the particular corps now broken up appears to have owed' its origin rather to the private conceptions of the late EmpEBon than to any systematic deductions of military science. It was based, in fact, upon a revival of tactics very ancient indeed. As early as the middle of tho 16th century the device of mounting infantry on horseback was imagined by a Marshal of France as a method of facilitating the then cumbrous movements of troops in the field, and the new clam of soldiers received the name of "Dragons," as an expression of the terrors which they might be supposed to inspire. The idea of thus combining the services of infantry and cavalry in a single corps survived up to the wars of the French Revolution,
and it still apparently approved itself to the late I CzAa, whose army included a very considerable force of this description, provided with the weapons both of cavalry and infantry soldiers, and trained to act either on horseback or on foot, as occasion might be thought to require. So complete, indeed, was the amphibious character of the corps that drummers as well as trumpeters were borne upon the strength of every squadron it included. This is the force which has now been merged in the regular cavalry of the army, with the view, probably, of assimilating it to the rest; for, though its value was never fairly tested on a modem field of battle, the received principles of military organization are opposed to a scheme which in aU likelihood would spoil both horse and foot soldier together. The musket and bayonet must necessarily embarrass the horseman, while the last model we should think of for our infantry would be that of dismounted Dragoons. We have, it is true, one mounted foot regiment in our own service,-that of the Cape Rifles, but this is a special adaptation to the peculiar duties of a special colony.
The position assigned to the Riflemen or Sharpshooters of the Russian Army seems at first sight very remarkable, inasmuch as this anm of the service, which comprised but a single regiment 30 years ago, now numbers 54 battalions, in addition to which a Rifle Company is specially attached to every Regiment of the Line. These proportions exceed very considerably those observed in the organization of other European armies, and such a system, when adopted under an Admainistration renowned at once for its solicitude and its sagacity on all such subjects, may seem well deserving of consideration. Although, however, the principle of the measure is obvious, and though some small augmentation of a similar kind has occurred in our own Army, we doubt whether the advance of military science will not eventually tend towards the depreciation rather than the extension of Rifle Corps as battalions maintained on a distinct and separate footing.
What is a Rifleman ? He is simply an infantry soldier equipped with a firearm, and therefore differs nothing upon a first presumption from any other soldier in the Line. But his equipment differs in quality, if not in kind. His weapon is constructed especially for long and accurate shots, and he is trained to manceuvres teaching him how to improve every advantage of ground or position which he can find. That in these respects he may be a better man than an ordinary soldier is very true, but why need the ordinary soldier be left in this position of inferiority? Why should not every man in the Line be provided with a firelock as good as can be manufactured, and taught to use it as cleverly as a Sharpshooter ? A Rifleman, after all, is nothing more than a musketeer armed with a musket which will kill, and one musket ought to do this as well as another. This, indeed, is the result to which our own military improvementa are now tending. We are equipping our whole army with weapons which, though still called muskets, are really rifles of the best description, and we are training the men of every regiment in the practice of rifle shooting. The system is excellent, and we have seen the fruits of it already; but, when it has been fuUy carried out, what will be the difference between aRegiment of the Line and a Battalion of Rifles ? As to any special training, whatever manceuvres would be useful to the latter wonld be qually so to the former, and, in fact, al regiments alile are now practised in the movements formerly confined to Light Infantry and Skirmishers. Take a paraUel from times long past, when the favourite weapon of Englishmen was the bow. We do not read in those days of any company of archers provided with particularly good bows or arrows, or expected to shoot with particular accaracy. Every man had as good a weapon as could be found, and endeavoured to use it as well as his neighbour.
It has been very common for the Armies of various nations to pride themselves upon their PRiflemen; the Swiss have long done so, the Tyrolese Sharpshooters are renowned in the Austrian service, and the Chaseurs de Vincennes in the French; but distinctions of this kind must evidently depend upon 'the general incompetency
of the main body. If, in an Army of 100,600 musketeers, 10,000 can hit the mark, wvhile the others cannot, they become, of course, a corps of peculiar utility; but their superiority would 'vanish when the other 90,000 became marksmen of equal merit. A valuable body of Sharpshooters implies by its very qualification a less valuable body i[L the remainder of the Army, whereas we see no reason why this species of inferiority should be permitted to prevail. If the rifle, or effective musket-for a rifle is nothing else-were ill adapted to general service, it would be another matter; but this idea, though it was at one time entertained, is now abandoned, and, as every man alike carries a firearm as his weapon, there can be no reason why one should not be as well equipped and as well trained as another,why the greatest available efficiency should not be imparted to alD.
in our opinion, it is better to malke every soldier in the Army a good shot than to assume that most of them will be bad ones, and provide special battalions for compensating the defect. In this respect every battalion should be special, and to such an end we hope our own organization is now tending. Some variety of aptitudes and advantages will naturally be found among the military Powers of the world, but in no particular ought our own country to be behindhand. As regards material-a most important point-we possess the best hardware, the best machinery, and the best workmen in Europe; as regards men, it is probable that Eziglishmen, as a body, take more naturaDly to firearms than any other people. It seems by no means unlikely, considering the improvements now proceeding, that modern battles will be decided mainly by the musket bullet, and if we only make the best use of the advantages at our command we ought never to be found inferior to an enemy.

The concert on Saturday night, which brought the series instituted and directed by lMr. Alfred Mellon to a close, was the best and most attractive of the whole. The first part consisted entirely of good music, without a single instance of condescension to what is not quite correctly termed the " popular," since it is simply the vulgar taste. The reception of a long and varied succession of compositions from the pen of one great musician-Mendelssohn-b a numerous, attentive, and delighted audienoe was sufficient to prove that the ' popular" taste is not exactly in so hd a plight as sundry pessimists on one hand, followed by the " fast " school on the other, are inclined to believe. Mr. Mfelon, who had before him the example of Ml. Jullien, the first and boldest experimenter, i a neow aud healthy path, the first who believed and acted upon the belief that the " gros public" could be made teeioy something beyond the standard of polkas and quadiles, knewr better, and gave his }?atrons such a concert as either of the Philharmonic Societies, old or new, could hardly surpass, if equal. The programme (of the first part, we mean) deserves to be cited:
Overtunte-k ,ldnmumner Ngiht's DreamL
Pour-part 8ong-" Ye bills, yo valoea' (Voca Unionz. Concerto, violin (M. Sainton).
Song-" The frst Violet" (1is Dolby).
S-renade, pianoforte (Miss Arabella Goddard). Four-prt Song (Vocai Union).
Synmpbony-A major (" Italian').
Song-` The ealand" (Mr. Millar&). Orerture-Itny Bla.
Such a programme did credit to Mr. Alfred Mellon, and its admira6le execution conferred honour alike upon himself, as condactor, and his highly efficient band of instruanentalists. The two glorious overtures, from the earliest and latest periods of the lfe of their composer, and the equally glorious symphony, written for and so long neglected by the elder Philharmonic Society, were played irreproachably -so Irreproachably, indeed that we are again compeUed to go to the famous concerts at the Paris CConservatoire for a parallel; and this parallel holds only with regard to finish and delicacy, since in energy and fire the precise Parisians have never approached the rougher denizens of our English orchestras.
The violin concerto (every movement of which was given) was a rare treat. AL Sainton, who has so often extorted the warm eulogeum of connoisseurs for his masterly execution of this magnificent work, uever deserved it better, or perbaps, so well. His performance was received, as it de' served, with enthusiasm. The Serenadc and Rondo Giojoso, forpianoforte with orchestral accompaniments, was, in consequence of its being so very seldom heard, if nossible, even a greater boon than the concerto, which last was laid hold of at the outset by aU the best violinists, from Ernst and Sainton (German and Frenchman) to Sivori and Vieuxtemps (Italian and MFeming), not to mention the countless intermediates and inferiors, nor Joseph Joachim, the first to attempt it, for whom Mendelssohn intended it, than whom no one has ever played it better, aud whose performance at the Gevandhaus concerts in Leipzic (1847) was the last musical display to which its composer ever listened. The serenade, written also for those celebrated concerts, and introduced by Mlendelssohn himself, -whose extraordinary execution of this last movement has not been forgotten-is novertheless ono of the least familiar of hbi productions, and, like the-two rondos in B flat and B minor, but for the enthusiasm of some pianists, true worshippers at the shrine of the last great genius the musical art has boasted, would in all probability have been consigned to the indec expurgatorius. Miss Arabeila Goddard is one of the few who, not content to exhibit their talents with the success which is certain to attend upon the more familiar and perhaps more brilliant concertos when competently rendered, impose on themselves the duty of studying and bringneg before the public the less known compositions of the master, doubtless impelled by the conviction that whxtever Mendelssohn wrote and gave to the world ought to be heard, and must one day be appreciated. She had already performed tho S&renade twice in public, and her constant predilection is a sign of the high value at which ahe (very justly) rates it. Never was zeal more worthily displayed. The oneing movement (the *erenade) is one of the most plaintive and lovely inspirations of Shakespeare's worthiest musical ilustrator; whlle the finale, the animated Bondo Giojoso, is all that its title suggests-an exuberant overflow of animal spirits, expressed in a mannersoimpetuous and unrestrained as only euch music can attain-one of the most genial and characteristic, in short, of the Mendelssohnian farmily of " schemr." Miss Goddard played both movements to perfection, displaying as much refinement of feeling and seaaihility in the first as fluent, dnfailing, and brilliant executionin the last, where the groups of rapid and inoessant ar=eg os that accompany the second theme have been the despair of more than one pianist who has had the courage to attempt without the requisite skill to accomplish it. Her performance was honoured by the loudest manifestations of approvaL
Nothing could be better in its way than the voeal music. The members of the Vocal Union-Miss M&aran Moss, Messrs. Montem Smith, Wilbye Cooper, and Winn-sung the beautiful ?artsongs with excelent taste; and Miss Dolby gave " he First Violet" with such genuine expression as to elicit a hearty encore.
The second part comprised a potf,pour-i of miscellanies of far inferior musical interest.
The concert was for the benefit of Mr. Alfred Mellon, whose appearance in the orchestra was acknowledged by the warmest plaudits from every part of the house,

The Legislature had pasea a concurrent resolution, almost unanimously declaring that the debt should be paid in good faith, and that immediate provision for the repament ought to be made. The miners were doing well Money was tight.
The advices from Central America state that Sa. Salvador was making vigorous efforts to strengthen her forces, both naval and miltary, and put her coast line in a state of ctefenc%. Generd BelloEo had been superseded in his command of the troops of that republic, and General Cabanas, ex-President of Honduras, appointed in his place. It Wa said that Walker had lost 400 men since the 1st of February. The Sierra Nevada had brought down a quantity of provisions for his army. The ailied officers were much divided in council, and had alo lost many men. The Costa Rican. had shipped a number of Walker's deserters to the United StatAs. These men had published an address to the soldiers still serving with the Filibusters, advising them to give up the cause in Nicaragua. From Walker there is no reliable news.
The New York Tirnes says
"Our advices from Central Americ state that
wholesale desertion of 126 men from General Walker's camp has taken place. From their statements it appears that the Filibuster chief is in a most desperate strait-hopclesa beyond redemption. He is Wtill ateivas, with a reduced force of from 300 to 400 men, whilo the sllies, reinforced to the extent of some 5,000 men, had surrounded him, to complete his destruction. We further receive the very important information that a partition of Nicaragua has oeen arranged by a convention at a session at San liiguel, in the Republic of San Salvador; and it has been determined to divide the State between Coda Rica, Honduras, and San Salvador. The Nicaraguans consent to the arrangement. Their dismembered country will be garrisoned by troops from the neighbouring States to pre. serve order, and after a specified time it will be reunited, and placed once more in the position of an independent republic. We learn a fact now for the first time made public, that on the 22d of December last the national Nicaraan Government issued a decree revoking all the sts of the Walker Government from the 4th of No. vember, 1855, to the 12th of June, 1856, including the decree revoking the charter of the old acesory Trantsi Company."

At Havannah, on the 25th ult., sugar had advanced in price; the stock at Matanzas and Havannah amounted to 185,000 boxes. More than 90 vessels had anrived at Havannah during the four days preceding, and consequently freights had declined. The Government, in consideration of the scarcity caused by the drought during the past season, had reduced the duty on corn one-third. With a full suipply of the article on hand prices had declined.

_E NEW PARLAMENT
MEBiBERS REtUENED.
i- e elections for England and Scotland have been
y published. The following is a list of the Wamembers returned up to the present time -
The New Parliament.
THE NEW PARLIAMENT.
(From tho Globe.)
After a careful analysis of the members returned for Eng'land and Wales and Scotland to the new Parliament, we come to the following conclusions: -In England and Wales, with 496 members, we find the Liberals number 288, the Conservatives 209. Either of these numbers must be reduoed by one, there being a double return for Huntingdon shire. In Scotland the number of Liberals is 39 and of Conservatives 14. For the whole of Great Britain, therefore, the new House wiU be divided into 327 Liberals and 223 Conservatives. In Ireland, although the elections have not yet quite terminated, they have progressed far enough to enable us to make a very close estimate. 0 the 105 Irish representatives the Liberals can safely elaim 53, or one more than half the representtation. The Tories would number 52, of whom about 40 are supporters of Lord Derby, while 12 (under the name of " Independent Oppositioi,ists") divide their allegiance between that noble lord and the priests. For all purposes of calculation, however, they come properly under the head of Tories, the party with which they almost invariably vote. We may, therefore, thus sum up the condition of parties in the new MRouse:-
Liberals. Conservatives, England and Wales .. 288 ... 209 Scotland ... . . .39 14 Ireland .5 ... 52
.380 275
In thus seoldng to reduce the different elements in the mnew Rouse to the denominations of Ubermal and Conserva. tives we have met with some difficulties, especially in the case of the Conservatives, of whom many have professed advanced Liberal and Ministerial sentiments on the hustinga. We have, however, invariably classed them with the party with whom their sympathies may be supposed more particularly to lie. Of this class there are at least 42 in-cluded under the head of Conservatives. Among them are such men as Lord Blandford, Mr. Sotheron Estcourt, Mr. Ker Seymer, hMr. Brarnston, Mr. Wilson Patten, Mr. Milnes Gaskell, Mr. Edward Egerton, and Mr. Drummond, -or as Sir Henry Meux and Mlr. Kendall, or as Mr. Gladatone, Lord Jermyn, and even Lord Robert Clin. ton, not to speak of some new members of a nondescript character, of whom we shall only say that we make them a present of Mr. Glover, of Beverley, as cheerfully as we gave them Mr. Murrough, late of Bridport, in the last Parlia. ment. We have, therefore, not been illiberal in our esti. mate to the " compact body" which Mr. Disraeli It is said, already feels proud of heading. On our ownL side the number of stragglers is extremely small. Making every dllowance, we cannot count 20 members among them who will not, we are confident, cheerfully and cordially co-operate with Lord Palmerston in carrying measures of liberal and practical progress at home, and in maintaining -our honour and commercial freedomn over the world.

The county contets are drawing to a close, and before the end of the current weekthe Irish contingent to the new Prliament will be ready for action. Upon the elections which have already terminated the Derb'ites have had a gain, which, however, may be at least partialy neutralized by the results of those still pending. In Armagl, for in. stance, the Hon. Colonel Caulfield, tho heir to the Earldom of Charlemont, and an hereditary Whig, has struck his colours without a blow, and handedover the representation to Mr. Maxwell Close, whose political principles are in prfect accordance with those of his colleague, Sir William Verner, one of the most ultra-Tories in the Hlouse of Commons. In Cavan there has been a change of men only, the Ron. Ca tain Annesley, the new member, being to the full as araent a Conservative as Mir. Burrowes, the retired member. The Downshire interest has had a
signal triumph in Down county. Mr. Ker, the mode.
rate Conservative, has been fairly driven from the field by Colonel Forde, whom no sane person would ever accuse as being in any way liable to the suspicion of moderation. He is an out-and-out supporter of Lord Derby. Monaghan, after a feeble threat of opposition on the part of Mr. Lennard, restores Mr. Leslie and Sir George Foster to their old aeats on the Opposition benches, as stanch upholders of undiluted Toryism. Greatly to the surprise of every one, and to none more than the defeated candidate, Mr. John George at the last hour was displaced is the county of Wex. ford by young Mr. HatchelD, whose nam%ue as a politician was never before heard of, and whose first debut was on the hustings as the successful opponent of Mr. George. In the county of Galway Dr. MacElale and his suffragan bishop, Dr. Derry, have sustained a most mortifjing defeatin the ejection of their repentant nominee. Captain Bellew, it is well known, bad given great offence to the Mooreites by now and then separating from the faction and recording a stray vote or so for the Government. The day of retribution, however, arrived and immediately after the dissolution the gallant offender hastened to freland and supplicated absolution from the Archieopiscopal dictator of the western province. This was at first haughtily refused, but through the intervention of Dr. Derry a truce wss .patched up, and Mr. Bellew was permitted to appear on the nustings as the episcopal opponent of Mr. Gregory. But it was too late. The thoroughly Liberal Conservative and popular landlord proved more than a match for his two mitred antagonisls, and, supported by the Roman Catholic and Protestant gentry, and with many of thepriests at his back, the eay was won, and a heavy blow given to the turbulent prelate whose onlysuccess at the present elections was the dubious victory at Mayo, where a Roman Catholic Liberal was set aide, and an avowed Derbyite substituted. With respect to the means by which the defeat of Colonel Higgins was effected the following correspondence tels a curious tale. Ur. Burke and his son are both Roman Catholic genYlemenor some position in the county, andtheir testimony regarding the Rev. Peter Conway's attentions, avouhed by the solemnit of an oath, must be regarded as conclusive. The letters appear in the Dublin .EeningPost, a Lihecal Roman Catholic journal .

But the publio nust not suppose that the part of the good Samritan wa the part acted by this clergyman on this oocason. On the contrry, i Is to him wo owe the attack made upon us, and his subsequent inter. ference arose from the fact that I urg ed upon him the scandal of allowing a mran of may athers years to be ill-treated in his presence; nde I have no doubt also because the rev. gentleman wisbhed not the efftieon of blood, but intimidation.

"IROBERT TIGHE."
Of the elections yet undecided the results of two are looked for with considerable interest, but as speculation in these days of strange chops and changes Is quite at a discount the public must abide the issue with patienco another day or two. The county of Dublin wi be fiercely contested by both parties, but it would be idle to deny that Sir Charles Domvile has further injured his prospects by an injudicious sentence in the course of his addre a on the day of nomination. Here is the objectionable passage .-
" I do not, eeek to repseeent in Parliament the owners of vllas ia this county; I seek to represent the owners of large properties and their tenant. I am supported by Lord Howtb, Lord Meath, Lori Lssndowne, Lord Talbot de Malahide, and C^lonel White, and, I may add, I support myself
The repudiated " owners of villas" constitute some threefifths of the constituency, and how they will relish this sneer at their insignificancy in the eyes of Sir Charles Dornviletitme will soon te3L With respect to the unexpected contest for Antrimn the following graphic acconrt of tho nomination on Thursday is condensed from the NZorther Whig:-"Were the Liberal electorsofAntrim aware yesterday that the couTnty was going to be contested by the Liberal party? Of course they were not. It would not at aU have answered the purpose, considering the circumstances of the county, to tell all the world. It was con. sidered necessary to take the landlord Tories by surprisaand it has been done. Elverything depended on deuding tbem, and they are furious at finding themselves deluded. None of tle great dictators thought it worth their while even to appear. Messrs. Macartney and a few friends, who were possibly only the frends of Colonel Pakenham, and Colonel Prkenbam himself, strolled up to the Court-house and up to the platform within the Court-house with leisurely and confiding aspects. No orders bad been given for the faithful ship carpenters of Belfast, or obedierntbludgeonmen of Antrim,theballwas empt. Gentlemen congratulated each other, and talked of the dinner Mr. John Tomson was to give them when thisvulgar formality was over. Antrirn they were going to dispose of genteelly in the political market, and the idea tha there should be any haggling about the transaction ha not yet s.truck them. Gtadually, howvever, they left off grinningand .imrenDg; and a strange puzzled expression came over iheir squiroarchical countenancea. They whispered' to Dr.

The urbane high sheriff pro. ceeded to businose, got through the writ, and invited oratory. 0f the speeches of the caudidates it is not ne. cessary now to say much; and in this special And harried edition we have time to sy but little. Mr. Macartney's speech was the wail of a baffled man-so mean as to complain of Mr. O'ara not having given him warning that his day was to come; and, indeed, we could pity Mr. Maartney, in tLe painful pon in which he found himself, but that we know no politician who more deserves punishment and degradation. Th ,gallant Colonel Pakenham spoke with
the modest oratory f the brave soldier; and, havng talked sinipSly and quiz, enjoyed the ringing cheers amid which
eghted thecrowvd by bold and hearty talk, which be did not care to refine with delicate elocution, and wo think he ought topleae the Liberals who read his declarations. He spoke out-a rare virtue in the most impulsive orator of the hustings in our day There remains only Mfr. 'Neil. Mr. MNeiil spoke in.'
Major Massy has made his parting bow totbe electors of Tipperary, ana in his valedictory address states that the treatment he had received was xuch as to prevent him from taking any future part in the politics of the county. The treatment of whicb the gallant Major complains was, it soems, simply a vulgar squabble about pounds, shiUlings, and penoe. One of the local papers thus reveals .-" A meetig of tho friends of O'Donoghue and Mwy was held in Thurles. The critical moment had come. lxpenses were to be defrayed. Nothing cau be done ' without the sinews of war.' An offer was made to Major Masy, which those who made it believed to have been fair and reasona ble. They stated that O'Donoghue was wiling to bear all the expenses of the former contest; but that inasmuch as he was figuratively carrying the gallant Maior on his aboulders, it was only jUst that the Major should bear al the expenses of the coming battle. To this request Major Mesy would not yield. He was then asked would he bear two-thirds of the contest-but with this request he also reued compliance. The scene that ensued can be better imagined than described. Major Ila&sy was unanimoudy condemned by the Committee. He made his way to the railway, not in the best spirits. On the contrary, he who had been cheered to the echo, and who had imagined himself the most popular man in the county afew minutes before, was foUowed, as we have been informed by several persons, with shouts of denunciation by an excited, turbulent, and fearful crowd of persons. The mutability of popularity was never more clearly illustrated. The consequence is that the gallant Major-Major Massy-hls, we are told, resigned his candidature; and though the Tories are beginning to put forth a feeler, seelng their strength in the last contest, and Mr. Sam. Cooper, of Rillenure. is this day said to be about, on the part of the gallant Major, to show fight under the auspiess of the Tory trio of Lords, we have no doubt whatever the game is up."

OB2EH PrDI?G ELEOTION, 1857.
TO THE EDITOR o0 TEEE T1SElS.
Sir,-I observe in your last two or three impressions Mr. Cayley is classified as a LiberaL As this is calculated to mislead, tol will probably be good enough to allow mo au opportunity of correcting the error.
There may be some difficulty in showing what the hon. gentleman's politics are, but there is nonm in showing what they are not.
It is not more than four or five years ago that I saw Mr. Cayley upon a platform in York at a meeting constituted, as far as it could be effected, exclusively of High Tories, and heard him advocatiDg resolutions in favour of protection, and in support of Lord Derby.
In his recent speeches on the hustings here, too, though vague and indefinite enough before the polling took place, he afterwards avowed himself a believer in Lord Derby, and, as regarded " protection," insisted that, so far from the repeal of the corn laws having been of service to the country, if it had not been for the providential influx of gold from California and Australia that measure would have proved an unmitigated calamity.
The folowing analysis of the poll at the recent election wil also show conclusively who Mr. Cayleys supporters are, and will help to a coclusiion as to the class to which that gentleman should be assigned, Mr. Dancombe being a Tory of the old school:-

The whole of the 3,226 spUlt with Duncombe are pure Tories, and 99 in 100 are from Dmncomnbe to Cayley; and without the support of Mr. D^combe, Mr. Cayley would have been nowhere.
I would not bave ventured to trouble you with this communication were it not that the weight of your authority in the matter is calculated to confirm an erroneous impression which prevailed in one of the poling districts of this riding, and but for which Mr. Cayley might have lost hi seat. I am, Sir, yours faithfullv.

Eloquence, And What Comes Of It.-If the mind
ELOQuNCE, A"N WHAT COMES oF IT.-If the mind of this country were governed by eloquence, certainly the Opposition should carry everything before it. What an array of debating power is presented by Lord Derby, Lord yndburat, Mr. Gladstone, Sir James Graham, Mr. Sidney Herbert, and, on occasions, Mr. Disraeli. But what is the effect of aU this eloquence, what does it tell for, what is it roodl for, weh tangible substantial results can bo shown ?
t really seems to bo nothig more than a vocal performance, whicb is heard with pleasure, applauded, and there an end. There is no effect extending to the conduct and action of men. The thing is aU operatic, out oZ the realm of prosaic reason. To eloquence a certain sort of admiration is readily accorded, but there is no surrender of the judgment to it. On the contrary, its most speciousconclasions are distrusted. The decline of eloquence is a commonplace of our time, and, seeing the stil greater decline of its influences, the only matter of surprise is that so much is left of a fire so ineffectual. The most homely unadorned sense and matter-of-fact mind combined with earnestness and straightforward purpose, such as were possessed by honest Joseph Hume, are rn the long run more than a match for the showy debating powers. The one wins a lasting respect and influnce, in spite of the ridicule of the passing hour
the other has a fleeting admiration, no permanent hold, no tangible effeat. We have been watching with much curiosity an experiment of the powers of eloquence in this election. Mr. Gladstone went down special (as the lawyers say) to Flintshire to fight the battle of his brotherin-law, Sir Stephen Glynne, against Mr. Mostyn. In the old strategic phrase, he sat down before the place, and pounded away at it with aU his powers of speech. He was not In this field analytical, he was not the strawsplitter-he knew better than to try the metaphysical refinements on Flints. He spoke roundly enough-too roundly to squae his assertions with trath-and there was nothing of the cloister in his harangues, except, indeed, the spite. It was thQ gownsman tucked up for a mill with bargees. Mr. Gladstone did not scruple to tell the Flints folks that the budeet of theGovernment would increase the expenditure by 6,b00,6001., or, as he phrased it repeatedly, that it would pick tho people's pockets to that amount. He aho assured them that the income-tax would be perpetual in consequence of the increasea expenditure of the Ministry and much more to the same purpose. In all this Mr. Gladstone steered cler of his usual fault of refining, alifying and explainin . His hearers, if they believed hi must have sup=poser that the Goverment was adding 00000001. to the charges of lat year, and laying on additional duties on tea and sugar. Eloquence of vehement sort, to which Demosthenes has given a name, was never more unfettered by factthan that of Mr. Gladstone in Flintshire. Invention and passion lent all their helps to his invective. There was also no lack of perseverance and pertinacity. He besieged in set form, and thundered away day after day, testifying against the extravagances and enormities of the Pahuerston Administration, and protesting against the ruin it is bringing on the finances of thenation aud the industrial interests. And what came of aU this eloquence in battery? Nothing, absolutely nothing, looking at the aim; some recoil, perhaps, in effect. lr. Mostyn, to vilify whom (as that gentleman says) M&r. Gladstone, the most eloquent man of bis time, had come down expressfrom Oxford, was elected by a majority of nearly 300, the numbers having been 1,148 to 857. Had all Mr. Gladstone's powers of speech won a single vote-doped the most simple voterl The effect was more probably the other way, and we saspect that Mr. Gkdstone with bis bluster did but repeat the Dart played by Boreas of old on the travellers cloak. If Sir Stephen Glnne possesses any prudence he will deprecate his brotherinu-4ws ecul3r offce the next time he presents himself as a eandidate, ad beseech him to trAcefer his advocacy to seome enemy's eause.-zaminer.
brsuLTs !ro Thernsm 3w PARis.-It has been stated that since the murder of the Archbishop of PAris by Verger priests have frequently been insulted in te satreetsand some accounts of the oondemunion of men for insulting them hae been given. On Thurs&y the Tribunal of CorictionalPoletried a maa namea Couvreux, formerlya vage schoolmaster, but now caly a day labowiuer, for having publicly insulted two of tUe clergy of St. Etienne du Mont.

Great Exhibition Of Art Treasures.
i #REAT SXHIBITIOV OF ART TREASUBBR.
(Fr.n OmI OWN CORRXSPO2>ZJENT.)
P ast NOESTER, Arnm IL
Perbapys the most important and interesting, department of the exhibition, except to the convoisseurs, wiU be the Portrait Gallery. Esclusive of miniatures, which number upwards of 1,500, it will consiat of between 300 and 400 pictures, collected and arranged by Afr. Peter Cunningham, Tho leading object is to exhibit the portraits of the principal characters in English history and biography upon a plan similar to that of the proposed Stanhope Gallery. The principle of Eelection, howover, is somewhat different. For example, 'Mr. Cunningham will not exclude tho porirait of Felton, the wsasin of the Duke of Buckigbam, but will place it by the side of that of his victim. Nor, while he includes the portraits of Lord William and Lady Rachel Russell, will he refuse to admit those of Titus Oates and Dr. Sacheverel. It appears to be his aim, in short, to represent all i classes, and also to illustrate as far as possible the history of British costume, from the ruff and farthingale of Queen Elizabeth to the latest fashion of Queen Victoria, and from the white trunk hose of the Earl of Essex to the tight black coat and buff trousers of the late Earl Grey. The collection will bearranged in chronological order round the aide' walls of the great central hall, and may be compared to the Biographia IBritannica, comprisug a senes Qf portraits far exceeding in number and importance the colection of illustrious heads mnade by Houbracken and Lodge. The portraits belonging to each reign will conimence with that of the Sovereign, and an unbroken series of fullUlengthi will ocupy the postof honour in the middle of the wall, beginning on one side with Queen Elizabeth and ending on the other with Queen Victoria.
The portrait of Queen Elizabeth is surrounded by those of Henry Vi., of Lady Jane Seymour, of I Edward VI., and of Philip and 'Iry, from Windsor Castle and Woburn Abbey. Next the Virgin Queen is placed, appropriately enougb, the portrait of her favourite the Earl of Essex, who is followed by Sir Christopher Hatton, the "dancing" Lord Cbanceelor, and by Sir Walter Raleigh and his wife. Close by is the portrait of Sir Henry Guildford, which was removed from Hamptoncourt to Windsor Castle by Prince Albert, as the finest specimen of Holbein in England. Then come a po-trait of Queen Elizabeth when young, from Hampton-court; a portrait of Bess of Hardwick, famous as a builder of houses, and to whom the Dukes of Devonshire and Portland are indebted for Chatsworth and Welbeck; and a portrait of Lady Arabella Stuart, the picture of which Horace Walpole had a copy made for him by Virtue. Here also is a half-length of William Camden, the historian, in his costume as Clarencieux Herald, contributed by the Painters' Stainers Company, of London. Camden's father was a painter's stainer, and the historian himself in his will left a sum of money for a gold cup to be purchased by the company, which cup is also in the exhibition. Further on we arrive at the portrait of Lucy Harrington, Countess of Bedford, the patroness of Ben Jonson, Daniel, Drayton, and all the poets of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. A apace near this point is reserved for the Chandos Shakspeare, and for portraits of Ben Jenson and Fletcher, the two last-mentioned contributed by the Duke of Portland and the Earl of Clarendon. From Dulwich CoUlege and' the Aslimolean Museum at Oxford come three portraits of Shakspeare's fellow-actors in his own plays-Burbage, Nat Field, and Lowen. Within a few feet of these portraits will be exhibited the likeness of the Earl of Southampton, the patron of Shakspeare, to whom the poet addressed the only dedications which he ever made on his own behalf. The Tudor period closes with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth in a fancy costume, and one of Mary, Queen of Scots, the former from Hampton-court and the latter from the Harleian collection at Welbeck.
The commencement of the Stuarts is marked by the portraits of James L, of his son Henry, Prince of Wales, and of his daughter, the. Queen of Bohemia.
"1 The wisest, meanes, brightest of mnaldnd".
has beensent from Gorhambury, and Sir Henry Wooton from Eton College. Here likewise is the full-length of Lord Deputy Falkland, in white from Strawberry-hill, the picture which sugoested to Walpole the figure walking out of the frame in the Castle of Otranto. Next to him is Villiers, the first Duk-e of Buckingham, who was stabbed by Felton; and the reign closes with the portrait of the first Sir Charles Cavendish, the father of the Newcastle branch of that noble family.
In the next reign-that of Charles L.-we come upon a group of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The centre is occupiedby a large picture from Goodwood, the seat of tbe Duke of Richmond, representing the ill-fated Monarch, his Queen, and children. On either side are hung the portraits of aU the leading Cavaliers who make so distinguished a figure in Clarendon's Ristory-Prince Rupert, Prince Maurice, the Duke of Hamilton, the Marquis of Huntley, the Duke of Newcastle, the Earl of Carlisle, and at least 20 others. All are byVandyke, and so many specimens of that master have not been seen together before. Nor have the beauties of the Court of Charles I. been forgotten. The Vandyke potraits include Henrietta Maria, the Countess of Car}isle, Madame Kirk, the Countess of Southampton, and manyother noble andbeautifuldames, known bytheir por raits in Lodge's great work, and by the accounts of them in Cklarend'ns Histor-. Charles I. waa, perhaps, the most munificent patron of the arts whom England ever had. M.r. Cunningham therefore has very judiciously placed near him the portraits of Inigo Jones and Vandyke, the great architect and the great painter of his day. The King was a lover of poetry as well as of painting, andi here, accordingly, we find the portraits of Sir John Suckling, Lovelace, Waller, and other poets of the reign of Charles I. Nor must we omit to mention a portrait of Sir Henry Lee, of Ditchley, and his dog, both well known to the readers of Woodslock and one of Sir Hugh Myddelton, who brought the New River to London. The latter is by Cornelius Jansen-there is a copy in Goldsmiths'hall, but the picture in the exhibition is the original, which was engraved by Virtue upwards of 100 years ago. Beneath the full-length portraits of the Cavaliers by Vandyke will be exhibited the great Commonwealth men, of whom, unfortunately, no portraits by Vandyke exist,-Cromwell, Lake, Pym, Hampden, Sir John Eliot, and the rest.
We have now passed down one side of the gallery, which, it will be observed, is occupied by portraits of the leading personages in perhaps the most important period of our history, from the beginning of Elizabeth to the restoration of the Stuarts. Many additions might be made to the pictures already enumerated. Above the series of full-lengths are half-lengths of some of the most celebrated men of the day,-Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, Cowley the poet, Archbishop Laud, and a great number of others, all arranged, as far as possible, in chronological order.
Crossing to the other side of the hai we find, facing the Cavaliers and Roundheads, alU the celebrated beauties of the Court of Charles II.,-the Duchess of Cleveland, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nell Gwynne, and the ret-eonbriu3ted ebiefly by the Duke of Richmond. Underneath is placed Catherine of Braganza, the Queen of Clorles II., in the Portuguese dresa which ahewore 'wheu she came
to England. The enp,ving of thB picture by Faithorne is well known. Next to Queen Catherine, and presenting a remarkable £ontrsato. her in point of beauty, is Iely's jortrait of Nell Gwynne with her faourite lambX tbe conribtia of Sir Samuel Meyrick. Then fu~le.w in thick atecession the por-
traits of the prin*r,.al personages mentioned in Ds Graininout.
The portrait of 1James II. heads avery scanty list. }His reign wag not favourable to art. The Dukeof Monmouth and the - unfortunate Lord William Russell are. almost the only portraits worth mentioning.
The p ortaits of William and Mary are followed immediately by that of Henry Bentinek, Earl of Port' And, andfavourite of King William, who plays
FO eonspicuou5 a part in Macauay' aBtstory. These Y .Mtures are fromthe collectionof the Duke of Port.and,'who, it may be stated in pasing, has been one ofthe largest contributors to this branch of the exhibition. The collection of ministures contributed by his Grace is magnificent.
The most strikiing featture in the spaco devoted to the 'reign of Queen. ne consists of the portrait. of the poets of that Aurusn .age. oHere is the portrait of Prior, by Rchason, hich the poet' himself speak of as a good Ukeness in a letter to Bean Swift. Ner it is a half-lengtb of Pope, So
by Richardson, with- the favourite dog On i[oa gr& ve the poet wished to inscribe for epitaph
*O' OrAre Bounce I'
but, fem_ing that it might cast ridicule upon the famous
" Or raeP,n 3or,sohVr
heabandoned & idea. Next to Pope, sadJappropriatelys, is tLe portrait of Gay,..whic-wara formerly in the. posmemson of Sir Jobua -R d. Further n103g are SIX tt-k«tportraits fno.nhe cd!ebrated collection of Jacob '>Uofo. Thaiyarv Al by Sir Godfrey Kneller. Addion may - afost; be supposed to be talking to Steel robably giving him good advice-and Congreve to bis brother dramatist, Sir John Vanbrugh. By the side of Congreve is the fe part2 ait of Dryden, xo well known from tke engraving by Edelinck. As Dryden made C(ngreve tbe guardian of hiu fame, Mr. Cunninghaur has done well in placing the two portaits togetker. Next to "'Glorions John" is his bookseXer Tonson, who drove so many hard bargains with the poet, and who is holding the book by which. he 'rade so mueb, and. Mlton so little-Paradir7 Lost. The last of the Kit-kats is a portrait of the, Lord Chancellor Somers, who has in his hand a. copy of Spenser's Faery Queen, his avourite poem. It is to be regretted that Mr. Baker, of BLyfordbury, the representative of Jacob Tonson, bas not; allowed the whole series to be exhibited; but; at the same time, we are thankful that he permitted Mr. Cunningham to select any ix he pleased Next to Gay is that portrait of Lady Mary Vortley Montague, by Rosca, a Milanese artist, which *as painted in 1739, when she left England for her long residence abroad, and which she gave to her friend and correspondent the Countess of Oxford. A short distance off is a portrait of Prior, with a cap on his head, by Rigaud, the original of the engraved, portrait prefixed to the early editions of his poems.
We have now arrivedat theanoverianacoession. Close to the portrait of George L are those of Barley, Earl of Oxford, and Sir Robert Walpole. Facing the Goodwood picture of Charles L and his family are the portraits of George II. and Queeu. Caroline, by Hudson, also from Goodwood. Here, too, are the portraits of both Pretenders, and of Lady Sundon, the favourite of Queen Caroline, well k:nown to the readers of Lord Hervey's moat intereatingMenirs. Withinafewfeetare Pelham, the Prime Minister, and Lord Chatham, the former contributed by the Duke of Newcastle, and the latter by Lord Lyttelton. The portrait of Chatham is the best that. exists of the great statesman. The " good" Lord Lyttelton comes next, and is followed by the only existing portrait of the poet he patroni7ed-Thonson, of the &easons. Beneath the portrait of Chatham is a smal full-length of the gallant soldier whom he selected to command the Britiash troops in America-General Wolfe. Of this, the most interesting portrait of Wolfe, there is no engraving. Not far from the likeness of the young Pretender is that of William, Dake of Cumberland, the hero of Culloden-" the Butcher."
The portrait of George IMI., the founder of the Royal Academy, is appropriately surrounded by the chief painters of the English school-Sir Joshua Reynolds, Wilson, Gainsborough, and others-contributed principally by the Academy and Sir W. W. Wynn. Amaong the statesmen of the day are Pitt, Fox, Bute, and North. The authors are represented by Johnson, Boswell, Gibbon, and Hume. The stage furnishes Garrick, Kemble, and Mrs. Siddons. Portraits will be exhibited of all the principal authors of the last half-century. The Duke of Buccleuch has sent a fine ful-length of Sir Walter Scott, painted by Raeburn, when the Great unknown was writing the Lay of the Last Minstne. Near to Scott is a small portrait of Burns, by Naainyth, contributed by his sons. lt is the only por.trait of the poet. At this point there ia a very
interesting group of authors, painted for the late Mr. Murray of Albemarle-street. There we have Byron, Southey, Coleridge, Campbell, ebooref, Giffard, Lockhart, and others; and in this group, as in the collection of Jacob Tonson, Mr. Cunaningham has placed the portrait of the bibliopole himself.
The gallery does not include living celebritie
with a single exception. As it begins with a Queen O it ends with a Qaueen, and the portrait of Victorha. hangs exactly opposite that of E Plizabeth.
The miniatures will be exhibited in a small gallery immediately adjoining the early English portraits They range fromn the timne of Henry VIII. to the present day, and illustrate the history of miniature painting in this country in a manner that has never' yet been equalled. The chief contributors are the Duke of Buccleuch and the Duike of Portland. It is believed thzat the collection of the former nobleman is the finest in England, but it would not be surprising it connoisseurs were to give the palm to that of the Duke of Portland. The Welbeck collection was formed for Harley, Earl of Oxford, by George Virtue, whose catalogue, made in 1742, has been lent to the Executive Committee of the exhibition.
Poisoning In Photography.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE T3IES.
Sir,-lni he Time, of this day I have remarked asetter from Th. Charles A. Long, by which he tries to trove-on Ecientific principles that cyanide of potassium cannot do a person the slightest damage other than alittle smartig. :He puts on one side the casa of Dr. Atherstone by stating that he believes; it to bave besn exaggerated, and finishe3 his letter by wriing, " In fact, there is no more danger in using cyanide of potassium in photography than there is-in drinldng alcokol disguised as sherry."
I have a gret respect for science, but at the same time a much greater for personal observ-ation and experience, andi I think that, in a matter like, the present, each persom (even if only an amateur) should simply state what haw happened to hims, if, bearing in mind- that because he may not have witnessed any unpleasaatnesuit it does not folloir that the evil cannot exist,
About six months-past I cleaned m7 hencds from nitrate of silver stains with some cyanide of potassium, using it like soap. I felt some smarting immediatey near the nail of my first finger, whero I had a slighto scratch. The finger swelled during the evening, and for 1'days the pain was sogreat that I could not bear a glove osa rey hand, or anything to toush the poisoned part.
About three months, past Sergeant Sands, of the ]loyaL Artillery Intitution, was oleaning hia-kauds with cyawnde of potashiutni he haviDgat the time two-small cuts on hi3left hand. Great painofollowed- the *Wlioation of the potassium, accompanied by swelling of-the hand and arm. For one month the sergeani vwas unable to.nse this limb, and wasobliged to-wear his- arm in -sling. PEth-the persons Lhavmentioned ane partiouarly healthy.
I have- frequently keArd, of men leeng the use of; their. brains for several hours through drinking alcohol,. but-. rmust own, that my chymical knowleape is- so slight that L do not know in what way this spirii is to be drlnk soAs-to, cause a loss of the ser7ices of a han& for several weeks.
Trusf.ng-that the two-cases I' have mentioned may. Peevent carelessness in tie-use-of the peison, which. otherods might cruse tho perssn the douhle.imisery oE suffering pain cdded to-the knowledge that he was by doing so actualy, flying inthe face of a.high photogepic aulthority,.

Advices from Odessa of the 22d March state that Couit Strogonoff, Governor of Bessarabia, had receved despatches informing him that the journey of 3he Emperor to that part of his empire was now dedOd. Tne Emperor is only waiting for the return tO St. Petersburg of the Grand Duke Constantine to got out. The Grand Duke will visit England; his arrival in London will probably take place towards the end of May.
Private letters from Vienna of the 8th mention that intelligence had been reeeived there that two battalions of Turkish infantry had crossed the frontier of Wallachia on the 6th, under the command of Salih Boy. They will remain in garrison at Rustchuk, in Bulgaria. The evacuation of the Ottoman troops comnmenced five days before the term agreed upon.
ML de Bismarek-Schonhausen, thePrussianEnvoy to the Diet of Frankfort, is expected in Paris, to confer, it is said, with M. de Hatzfeldt on the Neuchatel question. It was M. de Bismncrk who directed at the Diet that question when it was under discussion particularly in all that related to the free passage D Prussian troops through several of the verman States.
General Todtleben paid a visit yesterday to Prince Jerome and Prince Napoleon Bonaparte at the Palais Royal.
Prince Napoleon, it is said, intends visiting Egypt in the course of next month.
The Republicans seem determined to ascertaln their strength at the approaching elections by putting up M. Carnot as a candidate for the Legislative Chamber. They intend proposing him in Paris and in the departments. Some of the candidates are disposed to take the oath of alegiance to the Inperial Government, others refuse. The committee of that party will probably be allowed to act in Paris, but the Prefects wMn not permit them to act in the departments.
The oeremonies of Eoly Thursday were yesterday celebrated in the churches of Paris with more pomp than usual. The attendance was great everywhere from morning till late at night, and in some places the tide of human beings leaving one chureh to perform their devotions in others hardly ceased for a moment. At the Madeleine, St. Roche, Notre Dame, St. Sulpice, Abbaye-auxBois, and Notre Dame des Victoires the attendance was particularly numerous. Most of them were fitted up magnificently. Representations of the events connected with the Passion of the Saviour took place in several of them, but that of Calvary, at St. Roche, particularly attracted attention, and was the object of general veneration. Amid the sharp rocky eminences arose the cross, half covered with black cloth. A number of lamps, partly concealed among the crags, shed a "dim religious light" over the chapel in wvhich the tomb was erected, while the cross itself, on which the brilliancy was skilfully thrown, came out in bold relief. At thie Madeleine the tomb was erected in one of the aide chapels, but the effect, however inharmony with the rather ostentatious ornaments of the interior of that church, was not SO strildng nor so solemn as at St. Roche or St. Sulpice. The coffin was covered with velvet embroidered with gold, and above the whole rose a canopy of crimson velvet surmounted with white plumes. At St. Eustache the tomb was placed in the embrasure of the principal entrance beneath the organ. At ;2,e doors of al the churches ladiea belonging to v,rious charitable societies were stationed for the purpose of making collections, and it was evident that the ap peals on behalf of the poor were not made in vain. This day the same crowds throng the churches, and in all of them there is preaching.
I mentioned some days ago that the Episcopal Chapel in the Rue d'Aguesseai had been purchased by the British Government, and that the Chaplain to the Embassy wil perform divine service there in future. It may interest the English who visit Paris to lknow that the chapel wMl be closed after Easter Sunday for the purpose of cleaning and repairs, and
ill be reopened on the first Sunday in May, on which day divine service will be discontinued at the Embassy. It has been intimated that admission to the chapel will for the future be free, but that a cottain number of seats, at 5f. a-seat per month, may be had on application at the Embassy.

A letter from Rome of the 3d inst. announces that King Victor Emmanuel had proposed to the Pope to resume negotiations with the Court of Rome on the following bases :-Monsignor Franzoni to resign his rank of Archbishop of Turin, and to receive a Cardinal's hat in return. Ionsignor Charvaz, Archbishop of Genoa, to be translated to the see of Turin; and, further, that a concordat should be concluded which would efface all tile acts of the Piedmontese Government with respect to ecclesiastical matters for some years past.
Marshal Vaillant, Minister of War, in order to place the effective strength of the army in harmony with the estimates of the budget of 1857, has decided that freah temporary renewable furloughs shall be immediately granted to the soldiers of the classes of 1850, 1851, 1852, 1853, and 1854. They vill be divided in the proportion of about 100 to each regiment, making 3,000 for the first military division, of which Paris is the centre. These furloughs will not in any way interfere with the others, granted in accordance with the Ministeres circulars of the 7th of June, 1856, and the 22d of January, 1857.
The last day's promenade of LIongehamps was exceedingly brilliant. All yesterday afternoon, in the midst of the most delightful spring weather, the whole distance from the Place de la Concorde to the Bois de Boulogne was filled with long files of carriages, following so closely as to leave but very little space between each. Some of these were realy very handsome equipages, and the horses in many were as fine animals as could be seen in any capital in Europe. The crowd of pedestrians in the Champs Ely ades was immense, but of new fashions we saw none-nothing, in fact, miore than can be peroeived on any ordinary day in the streets and promenades of Paris.
A thunderstorm, the first of the present year, burst over the southern vicinity of Paris last evening about 6 o'clock, and gradually advanced into the centre of the city, bringing with it a fall of hail and rain. The lightning was peculiarly vivid, and presented a forked appearance. It is rare to have to chronicle here the visit of thunder and lightning so early in the spring.
The commission nominated last year on the monetary question, composed of MM. Magne, Schneider, Elie de Beaumont, Michel Chevalier, de Parleu, Boinvilliers, and Ernest Andre, met yesterday
under the presidency of M. Schneider, the Minit
of Finance, M. Magne being prevented by other occupations from presiding. T'he commission has ascertained from offlcial returns that the arrivals of the preci7us metals in France exceed the exports by more than 1,500,000,000f.; and from inquiriee made ofthereceiverl-general and theirfinancialagentsit appears t:ever was there so much specie in France as ,a present. In the departments, where the expenke4 have not increased so enornrously as at Paris, the quantity of coined money is stated to be inmeine, and the peasants, who formerly carried about them or concealed a piece of 20f., now do the same with:100f., or even in a greater proportion. This fact tends to explaia how it is that with a larger amount of the precious mietals coming into the country specie is anything but abundant.

AUSTRIA.
(0mos ou0 OWN COnnKsoNDENT.)
VIENNA, AnIL 8.
Some days ago you learnt from me that this Government being actuated by a desire to improve its relations with the Berlin Cabinet had given its support to Prussia on the Neuchatel question, and my statement is fully confirmed. The King of Prussia still timvely refuses to renounce his claims to the Principality of NeuchUel unless Switzerland apd the Conference previously formally recognize their justice and this resolution meets with the ap rovaj of Austria and Russia. His Prussian ajesty, who insists on retaining the title of Prince of Neuchtel and Count of Valangin, also demands a round sum-2,000,000f., as is said-as an indemnity for the loe of a part of the revenue of [the domains. A Paris correspondent of the Oesterchise Zei&mg states that Lord Cowle, "openly and plainy" soke in favour of Switzer,an at the Conference held on the 31st March, and he might have added that Count Walewaky entirely shared the opinions expressed by the British diplomatist. It is possible, and even probable, that some time wil elapse before the Neuchatel quetion is defimitivelysettled, but tho public need not fear that the King of Prusia will carry his point. The Emperor Napoleon has promiwed the Swiss Confederation that Prusia shll renounce her claims to NeuohAteI, and it is well known to several persons in this city that he Is fully resolved to keep that promise. " France and Enland" says a very well-informed ?renchman "11 w do all in their power to persuade Pzuxsia and her supporters (Auatria and Russa) to acknowledge the independence of Neuchotel, but, if they should obstinately refuse to listen to reason, the French and British Governments will declare that the Conference is dissolved, and then take such measures as may to them appear necessary and advisable." The Btud says that the subjoined conditions were made by Dr. Kern, the representative of Switzerland, at the fifth conference, but no guarantee can be given for their correctness -
" L Recognition on the part of Prusia of the oomplete independence of Neuohetel, and on the part of the Ktig a renunciation of all and every claim on that canton. 2. Switzerland oannot agree to a preliminary recognition of the alleged (angeWich) soereig rights of Prussia. in NeuchAtel. 3. Switzerland canot agree that the King of Prussia and the Princes of his house shall in future have a right to bear the title of 'Prince of NeuchoteL' On the contrary, Switzerland must, as well for the future as for the present, protest against any claia that maybe derived from the retention of that disputed title. 4. The charitable institutions will be maintained, and placed under the protectlon of the constitution and of the laws of the land. No further guaatees can be given. 6. The Confederation grants a general amaesty to the originators and sharers in the insurrection of September. iAke their fellow-citizens, they wvll be under the protection of the federal and cantonal constitution and laws. No separate guarantee can be accorded to them. 6. The Confederation wll bear the expenses arising from the occupation of the Canton of Neuchdtel and from the raising of the Federal 'army. The cantons will have to bear all those expenses which are not defrayed by the Federal Treasury. No pecuniary indemnification whatever can be mado to the Crown of Prussia."
France and England are said to be of opinion that an indemnity ought to be given to the PruLssian Crown for any private property which it may pomess in NeuchUtel.
One of the Vienna correspondents of the Augsburg Gatfe states, that two South-Slavonians forcedtheir way into the ante-room of the Emperor's audience chamber, anld there stated that a plot habd been formned against Elis MVajesty, which was to he put into execution while he was in Eungary. Inquiries have, been made en the subject, bat no reliable information has yet been obtained, The de.- parture of the A u]ic CJouncillor, Von Lackenbacher, to Constantinople was announced yesterday; and it is now in my power to inform you what his mission is. The finances of tho Turkish em pire are in grievous disorder; and England, France, and Austria have been requested to send a person skilled in money matters to the aid of the Porte. In a word,
acommiission is to be formed at Contantinole o examnining into the finances of Turkey, and M. Ton LJackenbacher is the person who has been "lent"
by Austria. Count Fecquelmont who was Minister! for Foreign Affairs in 1848, and "State and Conference" Minister in the preceding year, died at Venice on1 the 6th, M. de Ficquelmont, who was. 77 years of age, published three or four books during the last five or six years of his life, which contained marvellously little information, but plenty of abuse of England and Lord Palmerston.
There was something very like a panic on 'Chang,e to-day. English sovereigns were lOfl. 17k.; Austrian gold 8 per cent, and silver 5Q per cent, prem.
The Archduke Ferdinanrd Maximilian, on entering on his office of Governor-General of the Loinbardo-Venetian Provinces, has issued a circular to the administrative authorities on the nature of their duties, and on the spilrit in wrhich they must henceforth act. Among other things, he recommends that the people s.hall be allowed to develope fireely their material and moral resourcee, that they shall be treated with due conslderation and humanity; and that functionaries shall not by exaggerated zeal compromise the safety of the throne and the welfare of the population.
A letter from Florence, of the 2d inst., informs us that persons in that city who occupy themselves with politics had been much excited by the rupture of the diplomatic relations between Austria and Sardinia, and by the articles in the London papers on Count do .Rayneval's deapatch to the French Governmnent. The difficulty betvreen Austria and Piedmnont is considered serious in Tuscany, as it is not believed in the present state of Italy that Sing Victor ESmmanuel can make any concessions. The course pursued bythe Emperor of A ustria is disapproved even by his friends. Count de Rayneval's despatch was read with avidity even by those indifferent to politics. Many Moderates-of whom Lord John Russell, durnaghis last visit, after having conversed writh some of them, observed that they were Liberals on a level with Lord Derby-are indignant at wvhat Count de Rayneval says of the Pope and his Government. The writer adds-
" If the Count de Rtayneral had avnitten his despcatob after the arrest of the celehrated highwrayman ILaggerimo, anmounced some time since with so mach pomp by the oflicial organls of the Roman and Tuscan Govermnents, he wrould have found that his comparison betwreen the safety
of traveling on the Pope's roads and that between London and Windsor would be somewhat to the advantage of the latter. Unfortunately, I understand that, without any inzte-regnum, Laggerimo has fond a successor, who has already taken the liberty of giving several contradictions in fact to the assertions of the zealous diplomatist."
A letter from Venice, of the 3d inst., announces the departure of the Duchess de Berry, with her husband, the Duke della Grazia Lucchesi Palli, and I the Prince Campo-Formio, their son, for Florence land Naples.
A letter from Genoa of the 7th inst. observes that the very large number of ships which had arrived in that port since the beginning of the month proves the great increase in the commerce of the town. In fact, the quays are now overcrowded, and it has become necessay to increase the accommodation in order to facilitate the unloading of the merchant shipping.
A letter from Rome of the 4th inst. announces that on that day Mx Mon, the Spanish Ambassador, proceeded with great ceremony to the Palace of the Vatican, where the Pope granted him a private audience. He presented the Royal letters accrediting him as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Eer Catholic Majesty. After the audience the Ambassador presented hi attaches to the Holy Father. He then visited the Caidinal Secretary of State, who received him with,the honours due to his rank. M. Mon then visitea the church of the Vatican, and prayed before the relics of the ApostlesPeter and Paul. Thus terminited the ceremonies usually practised by the representatives of the Court of Spain.,

Napoleon At Waterloo.
N]AOLEON AT WATEBRLOO.
MARSHAL MARMONrS mEMOTRPR
The following letter, addresed to the Monitetmr by Count de Flahaut, who was one of Napoleon's aidesde-camp on; the field of Waterloo, is by far the most interesting of the many protests that the posthumous works of the Duke de agusa have provoked:-
" London, April 6, 1857.
MArshal Marmont says (voL 7, p.M), in giving an mcount of the battle of Waterloo:-'In the course of the day Napoleon found himself so far off from the field of battle that he could not make the necesuary modifi catlons in the execution of his plans& More parrio. IsAy, he was nnabls to support the cavalry movemeent in proper time. That movement being premature and isolated was useless, while, if the Guard had been sent forward simultaneously, the effect might have been decisive. When the army was in disorder Napoleon's mind was so ad upon by terror that be fled at a gallop for several leagues, and every moment (it was dark) fancying he saw the enemy's cavalry on his flk, he sent people to reconnoltre.' It is impossible not to perceive the malice of this whole story, which tho Marshal pretends to have had from General Bernsrd. That cannot be true, beause General Bernard was a brave and honest man, and consequently incapable of telling a tissme of falsehoods. The Emperor placed himself during the battle on a hillock in the centre of the position, from which he could survey the whole of the operations, and from which he saw the advance of cavalry ordered by Marshal Ney, and which did, in point of fact, appear to him premature and 311-timed. He at once exclaimed, 'There's Key turning a certainty into' an uncertainty, but now that the movement is comr' mnenced there is nothing to be done but to support tit.' He ordered me accordingly to carry an order that all the cavalry should advance to support and follow those troops which had already crossed the hollow which lay between them and the enemy's position. This- wa done, but, unfortunately, as the Emperor had feared, the moment had not come when such a movement might have been successfoL .However, it was imposrible to recall the squadrons that were already engaged. bI war there are certain faults which can only be repaired by perevering in them. Ileave to Marhal M1armont the honour, which I do not envy, of the parallel he hs instituted (p. 125) between the leaders of the two armies, and of the share attributable to esach in the results of the battle. He tak esa pleasure i. praising the English General at the expense of the Emperor; but, instead of taking so much pains to prove the Emperor guilty of mistakes which led to the fatal issue of the day, he might have understood that the unexpected arrival on our fiank of 30,000 Prussians, whose artillery swept our line of operations, was the real cause of the loss of the battle and its disastrous consequences The Duke of Welington had the pustice to admit this in his report to his Government. As to the terror which the Marhal pretends the Emperor gave way to, I cannot better refute this false ainertion than by atting facts of which I was an eye. witness, and which therefore no one is in a better position to bear witness of than myself. Ater having taken part in the suocessive attacks of the caval and the Guard, and when the retreating movement had decidedly set in I went to look for the Emperor. It was dark. I found him in the centre of a square of infantry, and I did not afterwards leave him. After waiting there some time longer, the battle being irretrievably lost, he left the field by the Charleroi-road. We went along, not at a gallop, as it is infamously said in the meroirs, but at a walk, and no pursuit of the enemy inspired the Emperor' with any such fears as the Marshal's malice attributes to him. So far was the Emperor from being troubled with any personal fears, although the situation was not
very re-assuring, that being completely knocked up by the: fatigue he had undergone during the preceding days ha, several times fell aseep, and would have fallen off his. horse had I not held him on. We arrived the next morn - ithg at Chxrleroi, where we took poEt for Iaon. There the Emperor hxlted to write the bulletingivinug an account ol
Ike fatal day, and he then set out for Paris. This is the; tn uth. Let the public compare it with Maral Marmonts malicious and lying narrative, and then judge. But liow can one express one's feelings of Indignption and disgst at 0eeig a -mua whose place it was to hope to be forgottenss
the best thing that could happen to him thus atackl ono , who was his benefator, and defame his menoryaftehavLb,g betrayed him when living? -

The Apprehended Murrain.
TIL APPREHVNDBD MURRAIN.
Ai much nlarm prevails on the subject of the spread to this country of a munrain said to be prevaleut on the corntinent at this time, the following eommunication made to the General Board of Health by Dr. Greenhow, who has been employed by that depariment to inquire into the subject, may be of use in. allaying exaggerated apprehensions. The communication is to be regarded as preliminary to Dr. Greenhoves detailed report, nIow in preparation
"To THE RIGHT HONs. W. MONSELL, M.P., PRESIDENT
or Tm G EsaAL BOARD oF HEALTHr, &c.
" Sir,-As great misapprehension and much unnecessary alarm bave arisen from the reported existence of a very
tAl and contagions murrain among the horned cattle of those continental States from which cattle aro chiefly imported into this country, it is desirable that the real facts thoull be understood. The disease at present or recently prevailing in Holstein and the adjoining countries is the Ipulmonary murrain,' and is identical with the 'lung disease' that has proved so destruotive among the herds and dairies of Great Britain and Ireland during the last 15 or 16 years.
. "Although possessed of infeotious properties in a moderate degree, the ' lung disease' is known to arise spontaneousty under certain ill-understood conditions of food and season; sndlnnot usuAly believed tohave beenimported hither from abroad. It is almost universally diffused throughout this country, having from time to time. broken out in an epidemic formin particular localities, and again disappeared, without any very obvious caue. Being already quite as prevalent here as on the continent, no danger exists to our cattle .from the importation of foreign cattle suffering from the diseaso.
" Notwithstanding this, all animals suffering from this or any other sQrious disease that arrive from abroad are de. tained by the professional inspectors of the Board of Customs, and, if necessary, immediately slaughtered, their bodies being effectually destroyed if found to be unfit for human food, or, if otherWise, then delivered to the owner. The ' lung diseasef' is the only epidemio disease at present prevailing among the cattle In countries from which horned cattle are imported into Great Britain.
" There is, however, another much more contagious and fatal disease, caled in Germany the 'Rinder-pest' or SteDpe murrain, which appears to have been confounded with the lung disease, but which, with one or two trivial exceptions, does not at present exist in any part of Germany or the west of continental Europe. This ' Steppe murrain' is a totally different disease from the Pulmonary saurrain, and is spontaneously developed only in Bessarabia, Podolia, and other countries of Southern Russia, from which it is never absent, and whence it frequently spreads by contagion into Poland, and sometimes into Prussia and Austria.
*' The most stringent measures are employed by the Ruso-Polish authorities, and by the Governments of Austria and Prussia, to exclude this form of murraiu from their respeotive tezritories. A regulation was published in Poland on the 9th of May, 1856, ordering the indiscriminate slaughter of all beasts that should exhibit any symptoms of the disease, under which, according to a recent return, 20,000 animals have already been slaughtered.
" Independent of these measures in the interior of the country, quarantine stations have been established on the Russo-PoBsh frontier, where beasts coming from the East are detained for three weeks. Similar measures for the exclusion and extirpation of the disease, should it show itself 'within those countries, have long been in force on the fron. tiers of Austria and Prussia. In Austria the infected cattle aire immediately killed as soon as they show any appearance of the murrain, their companions being kept in quarantine; vnd regulations stin more stringent aro enforced in Prussia, for both the diseased animnals and all other beasts that have beer, in contact with them are there kiled and buried eight feet under ground, quicklime being thrown into the pits.
" hese regulations have been most sternly enforced, and not only has the importation of cattle from Poland, where the murrain is at present beloved to exist, been prohibited, but rags, hides, hoofs, hay, wood, and similar articles likely to have been in any way connected with cattle, and all persons suspected of having transactions with cattle, have been forbidden to cross the frontier. To enforce these regulations detachments of troops have been stationed along the frontier at al the points of eg#esa from Poland below Thorn.
" Notwithstanding these precautions the murrain occasdonally passes into Austria and Prussia, and intelligence has been received by our Government that it has recently been imported into both these monarchies. It has been conveyed into Silesia, in the neighbourhood of Breslau and Oppeln, by means of diseased cattle said to have been purchased in Galioia, but has not spread into any other Prus sian province, and has, in fact, thus far been confined to the oxen of the infected herd. Most effective measures have been taken to arrest the disease, 'and, judging from the experience of last year, there is every reason to hope that its propagation will be prevented, and its extinction secured.'
" As soon as the murrain was known by Her Maesty's Government to have reached Kowno, Tauroggan, and other places in the vicinity of the Prussian frontier, an order in Council was issued forbidding the importation of cattle, ansd of hides, horns, hoofs, fodder, or other articles likely to be vehicles for conveying the contagion into this country from any port in the Baltic east of Denmark, thus prevent' lg all possible danger of the importatien of this disease, so lotg as it shall be confined to the eastern frontier districts of Prussia. In addition, however, to this precaution, the greatest watchfulness over the importation of cattle is maintained by the veterinary inspectors of the Board of Customs, beth at London and the other ports of importation.
" I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,

SEWERAGE OF PARIS.-The Prefect of the Seine
SzwmAGXu or P.&AB .-The Prefect of the Seine has just presented a report to the Municipal Council of Paris on the subject of a large tunnel-sewer to be formed in such a manner as to carry off the water which in rainy seasons inundates some quarters of Paris, particularly the Faubourg Montmartre Rue de Provence, Chauss6e-d'Antin, and neighbolarhooa. The document states that the surveys which have been made clearly establsh that the very slight fall of the river at Parls, where in fact the bed of the Seine is nearly on a level, renders it impossible to prevent tho waters, when high, from flowin
up into the sewers. When the river is at a height of 3 metres70centimetres the water runs up into the sewerof the Rue de Rivoli as far as the Place du Palais Royal, and comSletely stops the service of the sewers, particularly that of he fountai8s of the Place de la Concorde. When at a heiqht of 5 metres 25 centimetres it flows up as far as the Rue St. Denis. The Prefect states that in presence of these facts he conceived the idea of turning to account the bond in the river, which, about Asniires, approached near enough to Paris to serve as an outlet for the sewers of the quarters on the right bank about two metres lower than the grand sewer which runs into the Seime at Chaillot. The report then Foes on to describe this now sewer. "It will start,' it says, "from the bottom of the Rue Rumfort at its junction with the Rue de la Ppiniere, run to the Place Laborde, and follow the Rue Malesherbes to the Barri8re de Monceaux, and thence to. Asnires. A communication may bo immediately made under the Rue Rumfort with the large sewer which runs to ChaMilot. By hereafter prolonging this sewer to the Place de la Concorde by the Boulevard Malesherbes and the Rue Royale, the Rivoli sewer and almost all those of the right bank may bo connected with the new one. Another branch, which it will be desirable to commence without delay, would run along the rues do la Pepiniore, St. Lazare, Lamartine, Montholon, Papillon, and Paradis, and even,l If necessary, as far as the Canal St. 'Martin. This line would receive the water which so frequently causes the inundations above alluded to. The expense of this undertaking, which is of the greatest importance to the health of Paris, is estimated at. o,480,000f. This sewer would, within Paris and as far as the fortifications. form a tunnel, and beyond them be made by a covered cutting. The width of the sewer is propoaed to be six metres, and high enough for boats to pass. One of the causeways at the side wi have rails lai down for waggons, by which hereafter a general system of carrying offthe soil from the waterolosets in Paris may
establihed" fTthree years will be required for the complet excuton f te whole of this work, and, as It is desiralehateitsho be commaenceds immediately the Pre feetconluds hs rport by proposing a credit of Y,200,000f.
IN Pths.-A number of houses on the Qual des Grands ugustin the Place dii Pont St. Miohel, the Rue do l'iodle he Rue St. Andr6 des Arts and the Rue deo lalarpe are required to be demolished for the portion of the new Boulevard do S6bastopol coinprised between the Seine and the Rue del'Ecole de M6decine on the left bank of the river. The municipalty has treated with the owners and occupiers of many of them, and a jury has just been occupied nine days in fixing, under the pro sidency of a judge of the Civil Tribunal, the indemnities to be paid to those who hate declined to accept its offers. These persons were divided into two categories. Tn the first the owners, who demanded 978,420f., were offered by the municipality 562,580f., and obtained 795 000f! the occupants demanded 716,750f., were offered' 30,587f. and obtained 318,5M00. In the second category the owners asked for 556,SOOf., were offered 385,000f, and obtained 455,000f.; the occupiers demanded 941,154f., 'were offered 199 169f and obtained 435,975f. The same jury also fixed tiLe indemnities to be paid to the owners and occupiers of houses in the Rue deloa arpe, the Rue des Noyer%, and the Rue St. Jacques, which are re. quired for the new Boulevard de St. Germain, which isato run parallel to the Seine. To 13 owners of houses In those streets, who demanded 789,469f., and were offered 404,460L, 559,COOf. were granted; and 46 occupants, who asked for 984,173f., and were offered 185,537f., obtained 429,795!. Iastly, thejury fixedthe indemnitiestobe paid to tho occupants of a house in the Cour Batave, which is required for tbo Boulevard de S6bastopol (right bank). To oue of these PVr,ous, who asked for 75,000f., and to whom only7,000f, ve Se offered, 35,000f. were a-warded ; and to another who deniand1d 43,000f., and was offered only 2,5O0f., 30,000!. wor ace Wrded.
The Kidderminster Rioters.
THB KIDDERMINBSTER BIOTERS.
At last the police have secured some 30 of the persons chb zed with having taken an active part in the attac,k upon the Right Hon. R. Lowe at the polling booth at Kidder.
hiLrster election, and on Saturday they were taken before the mayor and magistrates for examination on the charge of rioting; the other caes heard before the lnagistrates up to that day having been merely charges of assaalt. The fol10W;Dg were thenagistrates before whom the inquiry was taken at the Town-ball at lKidderminster :-Mr. Kiteley ftisyor), and Messrs. J. B. Best, G. Hooman. H. Talbot, W,Roden, G. Turton, W. Nickolls, and W. Grosvenor. The greatest excitement prevailed in conseqance of the position of some of the persons charged, and the justice-room and street were crow ded.
Mr. Kettle, of the Oxford Circuit, appeared to conduct the pzosecution; and Mr. Byrne, and Mr. lauddleston, tof the same circuit, for the accused; Mr. Byrne appearing for Mr. Alfred Talbot only.
The following are the names of the persons charged with riot:-Mr. Ilenry Chellingworth, of Park Attwood, gentleman; hir. Alfred Talbot, of Greenhill, Kidderminster, gentleman ; Nelhan, Pitt, William Willings, Bobert Westwood, HIenry Weatwood, John Drary, Williama Wood, John Bushell, William Biggs, George Barker, Albert Perries, John Cook, George Barker, Samuell3veritt, John Smith, Samuel Payne, Benjamin Potter, BhEzabeth Bentley Benljamin Jeavons, George Bishop, William Ayres. Rzichard Davis, Edwin Keysall, George Chalk, and James Williams, Several of these are respectble tradesmen of the town. Drary, Bushell, Biggs, Smith, Elizabeth Bentley, Ayres, and hal had not surrendered.
Before the case was gone into Mr. HRUDDLxSTO1T addressed the Court, stating that he bad been informed a committee bad been formed in the town, and a subscription got up to defray the expenses of the procecution. He trusted if any of the magisttes on the benchhad subscribed tothat object or joined the committee they would see the propriety of retiring from the bench.
Mr. HOO3Ir (one of the magistrates) thereupon rose and said, that as his partners had entered the name of the iirm -Pardoe, Hooman, and Pardoe-upon the subscriptionlist, though entirely without bis previous knowledge or sanction, it would be more agreable to his feelings to retire-from,
The MAYOR, then, on behalf of the otber magistrates, distinctly avowed that to magistrate on the bench had sub. scribed to the fund, nor had any of them even a knowledge where or when the committee held its meetings.
Mr. KxvTLE then addressed the Bencb, stating the facts as they afterwards came out in evidence, and called as the first -witness
Mr. Ebenezer Guest, bailiff of the County Court of Kidderminster (who it wlll be remembered wrote a letter to The Times on the subject of the riot). He deposed that at about half-past 3 o'clock on the evening of the polling at Kidderminster (Saturday the 28th ult.) he went to the Blakebrook polling booth by a roundabout way, having learnt that several people had had their clothestorr. by being mobbed in the regular route to the booth. He found between 6,000 and 7,000 persons round the booth. There was a great deal of rough shouting going on at this time, but on the whole the crowd aW rather peaceable. A few minutes after he arrived he saw Mr. Alfred Talbot in an elevated position in front of the hustingi, on the platform raised for the reporters. He was making motions to the crowd, as if he wished them to be quiet that they might hear him. Up to this time witness had seen no stones thrown. Mr. Talbot, addressing the mob, said-- " Now lads, don't throw stones !" Then there was a bit of a laugh, which drowned the remainder of his observations. Almost immediately afterwards, when Mr. Talbot had descended from his elevated position, there came a volley of stones into the booth where witness was. The stones appeared to be thrown at that part of the hustinp where Mr. Lowe and his friends were stationed. The volley con. tinued long enough for a person to throw six or seven atones in succemsion before there was any cessation whatever. The volley broke the inkstands of the poll-clerks, who were scattered in all directions, some of them getting under the tables and screening themeelves as well as they could. Mr.A
Talbot then came forward and charged the mayor with having ilegally closed the poll. He appeared in a very excited state and said, "I protest against it ;" "You have no business to close the poll," &o. - on which the Mayor said, "I have not closed tne poll; i am ready to receive any votes that may be tendered." Mr. Alfred Talbot then left the booth-he should say then and there, and witness did not see him again until after Mr. Lowe had got to Mr. Sheppard's house. The stone-throwing never entirely ceased afterwards. I saw one person-a Mir. Joseph Flinn, an expert cricketer at Kidderminster-catch three stones in his bands. As the stones appeared to be directed against Mr. Lowe they got him to change his position, and he and several other persons stood up before him to screen him. After that witness saw Mir. Wiliam Pitt, a butcher, and one of the accused, on the left side of the booth leaning on his ann. Witness thought he appeared to be taking it all very coolly, and looking at him saw him making motions to the mob wnth his hand in front of his person, beckoning them in a particular manner (witness imitated the motion) ; and then with his thumb pointing over his shoulder, but so that his shoulder concealed the motion from those in the booth. His thumb was ointing in the direction where Mr. Lowe was sitting. mter that the stones came in the direction where Mr. Lowe wa, he having changed his place after the fizst volley. The stones struck Mr. . Rockall, who was standing by Mr. Lowe. On this they again moved the position of Mr. Lowe, and called the attention of the town-clerk to Mr. Pitt, in consequence of which Mr. Pitt left the place where he was standing. Mr. Lowe was again moved to a bench close to the back entrance to the booth, and Willings and the two Westwoods pointed the crowd in that directon, waving to them to go to the back of the hustings. A number of "roughs" then rushed in that direction, and a mnn named Clift was told to keep the back door. Wllings attempted several times to force his way through the back door, which would have been fatal to Mr. Lowe, and the bottom hinges of the door were forced off. Willings and the Westwoods were very violent and excited, and said they would have the return. After the authorities had been called upon several times to read the Riot Act Mr. Lowe and his friends got out of the booth and proceeded towards the town, having special constables on each side of them. They went three and three, Mr. Lowe having M1r. James Pardoe on one side and Mr. James Hooman on the other. No attempt was made to touch them by the crowd, except by missiles. The mob continued to shout, cefore they left the hustinga and afterwards, "Throw them out !" "Kill the pink eye!" (a name which had been given to Mr. Lowel
" Pitch out the b- " The most violent appeared to be bricklayers, masons and stone-etters, and notwAvers of
idderminster. Saw Drury, 'wood, Bnshell, and Bigs
there. Wood was throwing stones at the procession, as it was called; one man who had hold of witness's arm was knocked down. Saw Mr. Rockall and ten or 12 other persons knocked down. They had to pass along the road where there were raised banks, from which the people were throwing stones upon them. Did not see anyone stoop to pick up stones. There were many women there who had collected stones intheiraprons,in the corners oftheirshawls, and in baskets. Should think he saw between 200 and 300 persons getting stones on the left-hand side of the road. Wit ness mentioned the names of several Dersons whom he saw struck with stones and brickbats. T'he people cried out,
You're a - pink-eye I We'll have Boycott yetJ" When they arrived at a place leading up some steps to Mr. Best's theprocession tried to go up that way, but the steps were ali occupied by women sitting on them, row above row, with theLr aprons full of stones ; and the bulk of these threw their stones on Mr. Lowe and his friends. Mr. George Barker was there groaning and making a hideous noise, and threw a stone which hit Mr. Lowe. These sten were near the house of the Rev. Alr. Sheppard, and the party then went in that direction. They got to Mr. Shep. pard's gate, which could not be opened, and witness heard some one caling to them to run to the side door. Thisthey did, and at last %.Lowe got into Mr. Sheppard's house. Mr. Lowe's hat was very much battered and was very dirty, as if from lime off a brickbat. Blood was flowing from his head, both inside and outside of his hat. Witness took Mr. Lowe's hat off and found a lot of coagulated blood, which stuck to witness's fingers and made him foel quite sick. (A laulgh.)
The AYOR requested that the public would abstain from such indecent expressions of feeling, and threatened, if it were renewed, to order the court to be cleared.
Tho witnees went on to describe the injuries which other persons had received. Policeman Jukes was brought in insendsble, and bleeding profusely. Witnews became excited, and -was near swoonig He afterwards escapedl from the house by the back door.
The witness was cross-examined at some length by Mr. BYscx and Mr. HEDDI STON, but his evidence in chief was not ehaken.-The stones were thrown into the booth with force, but a few were pitched into it. Witness had formerly been a rate colector, an acoountant, a bookkeeper, a clerk -anything of that sort, and a newspaper reporter. Went to the hustings to pick up information to send to a newspaper. Attended Mr. Lowe's committee for the same parpose. Heard Mr. Lowe address the people on the day of nomination. There was a good dea of disturbance and noise then, and he could not get a hearing for some time. He addressed them first as "gentlemen," then "ladies and gentlemen," and afterwards as "children." There were a great many children at the nomination making a noise. Did not know who were the committee for conduct.-
,ngtho prosecution. Had been employed byv MrV. Wnlter,
(the attorney wvho instructed Mr. ikettle) to copy depositions. When Mr. Flinn, the "expert cricketer" caught the stones, he might have said, "You've not bowled us out yet." Heard some one say, "Caught out !" Should not think it was Mr. Lowe that said so, but could not undertake to say it was not him. Witness was excited when in the booth,-not alarmed; but mnst admit that when he got into the crowd he was terribly frightened, so that he "bolted" at last. He had begged the magistrates to read the Riot Act when in the booth, and said the conduct of the crowd was unmanly and disgraceful. Mr. A. Talbot
was present when Mr. Lowe addressed the electors at the' nomination, but did not see Mr. Chellingworth.
Mx. James Pardoc, imerchant, of Kidderminster, smai, he was one of tho committee formed for the purpose of carrying on the prosecution. The committee had held a sitting at the Liorn otel one day that week, Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. Walter, their attorney, was employed by the corporation of Birmingham as the public rosecutor in that town, and was a La, tema-n of considerable experience, Was ,resent at thet plig booth on the day of the poll, anid PAW r ATalbot thero.

the protection of Mr. Lowe_and only knew that there was shouting and stone-throwing and blow-striing.

John Clift, coal merchant, ave similar testimony as to the course of events - Mr Ta¶bots address to the crowd -- theo stone-throwing fosllowing immediately; the change of position by Mr.i Lowe, followed by a change in the direction
of the missiles; and the progress of Mr. Lowe and his pare y aiong the road until they tought refuge in 3r. Shepprd-'s l.ouse.

Edmund Potter spoke to the accsed Payne as having struck him on the nose in front of the polling booth, upon which witness was immediately mobbed, kicked, and knocked down. Was not avoter.
Thomas Mole, a special constable employed on the occasion, spoke to the speech of Mr. A. Talbot being followed by stone-throwing. The atone-throwing continued until about half-past 4. Accompanied Mx. Lowe and his friends to Mr. Sheppard's, and afterwards accomoanied the crowd thence into the town to the Albert Inn. There wa rioting all the way. He identified Bushel as one of the rioters.
Solomon Rollins, forgeman, said, there had been stonethrowing before Mr. A. Talbot spoke to the crowd. They had just ceased for a time- when he got up there. Saw Mr. Talbot afterwards descend and go among the crowd.
Joseph Brewer, ostler, added to tho above, that when Mr. A. Talbot came down into the crowd some of them cried, "Mr. Talbot forever 1" They said it more than once. Mr. BxTrn.-Did Mr. Talbot say anything then?
Witness.-Mr. Talbot said, " Go a-hed, lads P" (Sens. tion.) The stoning continued after that.
Ellen Lee deposed that after the close of the poll she was standing with her sister on the elevated bank by the aido of the road along which Mr. Lowe anct his friends had to pass when she saw Mr. Henry Chellingworth looking at them. He could see the people throwing stones. They were throwing them from the bank -where witness was standing. When Mlr. Lowe's party passed Mr. Henry Talbot accompanied themn, and a stone struck him in the eye, on which witness sad to her sister, " A stone lsa caught Mr. Henry in the eye." Me. Chbllingworth, hearing this, asked "- What Mr. Hen rv Witness replied, " m.
HIeny Talbot," and he smled nd said. " Served him' right; let every one have a taste; Mr. Cbellingworth did not at all attempt to prevent it. Mr. Chelluigwortoh followed by the side of the road as Mr. Lowe's party went on.
Cross-examined.-Had had one child, but vas unmarried. Had spoken to her sister on the subject since the occurrence. Some gentleman was with Mr. Chellingworth.
Eliza lee, mater to the last witness, and servant to 3r. William Tbot, corroborated her lslter's statement. Had spoken to her sister about this since the event.
Several witnesses-were then called to identify some of the accused as having taken prt in the2stone-throwing. These witnesses were John Edwards, Elijah Morgan, John Blakeway, Benjamin Footman, and policemen Juker and Drew.
The Rev. John George Sheppard was then examined, and described what he had seen from his house in the evening. He said -I live at Woodield-house, on the road from the pollng4ooth, at Blakebrook-green, to the borogh. I was standing on the. prden wall looking In the direction of the polling-booth. Mfy attention was partieularly directed to it as the clock struck 4, and I was waiting to see the candidates pass to the town. I had a small telescope with me, by -the aid of which I lsaw that the mob was much excited, and that stones were being. thrown into the booth. I saw the Mayor, and Mr. Best, and another person whom I did not know, addresing the mutltitude from the hustings. The next thing which I witnessed was the departure of Mr. Boycott from the poll. ing-booth. He passed along the road beneath me to tne town, accompaniea by some gentlemen. Considerable delay appeared to ensue before rh. Lowe left the booth, and the excitement continued. Atlast Mr. Uowe and his ar ap peared precipitately to rush down the steps of the booth and entered the open space immediately beneath the hustinga. Loud shouts and yeDs immediately followed and tne mob closed on the arty, it being evlden6 that stones were also being thrown. As they ad. vunced towards my house they came beneath the bank on the right-hand side of the road. On this bank a large number of persons had been stationed for more than ha an hour, and those persons, immediately on the appearance of Mr. Lowe and his friends, threw volleys of stones on their heads. They were alO stoned by the nob in the road, and attempts were arparently made to get at them, which attempts were repelled by tho police in uniform. Wheuthey reached my wall, being in a dangerous position, Irushed to my front gate, which a reached about the same time as Mr. Lowe, Mr. Pardoe, and some other gntlemen whose faces I could not particularly distinguish. I found the gatelocked, I could easily have forced it open, but from the pressure of the mob and the number of stones thrown I judged it unsafe to do so. I then shoutod through the open bars, " Make for the other gate," to which I ran myaelf with all speed. I got it open two or three minutes before the arrival of Mr. a owe. As soon as I saw him I dragged him in, and opposed my own person tothe entrance of the mob, whowere allthe .ime directigmissileE atthoseat thegate, anumberof which struck me. (Witness produced some brick-ends which had been thrown at him.) After getting the gate to with some difficulty, I took Mr. Lowe into the house and sent for a surgeon. IYr. Lowe's face was covered with blood. Many hundreds of stones and brickbats were lying about after. wards. Saw Mr. Chellingworth in fronit of his own house a few minutes before Mr. Lowe's party came up. He had two gentlemen with him.
MIr. Samuel Stretton, surgeon, was called in to se Mr. Lowe. Found him suffering from a severe wound 'on tho right side of the head with a fracture of the bone. There were two other eevere contusions on the side of his face-
one on the side of the right ear. Afterwards found the results of other injuries in aious parx of his person. The wound on the head was decidedly of a dangerous charac. ter. Also examined Policeman Jukes, who bad received a severe wound on the nose, which had fractured the nasal bone. He had also a wound on the right eye. Attended other pesons mjured in the same attack
Richard Holman, dyer, deposed that he saw Mr. Alfred Talbot return to the hustings shortly after 4 o'clock, with a number of persons, about a hradred or two, the bulk of whom appeared to be briedayers and carpenters It was after that that he spoke to the crowd from the booth, and that the stones followed.
Mr. KrLE, at the close of the examiination of this witness, said this was the case for the prosecution.
Mr. HTDDLESTON then submitted that, as no evidenoe had been offered criminating Samuel Everitt, Jeavons Davis, Keysall Williams, and Bennett, they mnst be discbarged as to this charge.
It was intimated that against some of these there were other charges to be preferred.
Mr. H1DDLE.STON then asked for an adjournment of the other cases, except Mr. Chellingworth's.
Mr. BruE also asked for an adjournment asrespected Mr. A. Talbot.
The magistrates, after retiring, decided to adjourn the further examination of all the cases, including those of Mr. Chellingworth and Mr. A. Talbot, until Friday next.
Bail was renewed by all the defendants.
HORRIBLE CRUELTY.-A case was brought before
HonRiB COR Y.-A case was brought before the Chapel-en-le-Frith Petty Sessions last Tkurslay, exhibiting features of the most revolting and inhuman treat. ment by a father to his daughter,-a child of about nine years of age. His name is Peter Rowland, a tinman, resi. ding at the above-named place, and the child, named Deborah, appears to bave been, from her infanv, an object of his aversion and violence, even to the extent of causing injury to her spine, thus rendering her a cripple for life. Rowland is also described as having been guilty of cruelty andneglect towards his wife, who died about 18 months ago, far advanced in pregnancy, as is alleged from "his unpardonable neglect of her." After the death of her mother it was thought dangerous to trust the child with him, and she was taken care of by a pandmother, who from some cause, about a year ago, sent her baek to her father, and abe appears to have been reasonably well attended to for somo weeks, but was afterwards found in the house of a Richard Chapman, of Hope, where the father and two of his boys lodged, in a fl.thy and loathsome condition, covered wvith sores, and apparently perishing from want of nutriment, and having the appearance of an idiot. The Rev. hfr. Daniels, the vlcar, at this stage interfered, and an attempt was made to get the poor creature into the union house, but it failed, owing to the father's brutal treatment not having been represented to the Chapelen-le-Frith guardians; and an attempt to lay the case before the magistrates felltotheground, owingtothe difficulty of ob tainingconclusive evidence against Rowland. These attempts proved unavailing for good to the child, and her father removed with his family, consisting of himself, a brother, and three children, into a sort of workshop, in which apartment they all lived and slept1 and it is described as being a most unwholesome place, beng, from some local cause, mostly fled with a sulphurous smoke; and here the child was locked up for hours together, without sustenance or an Idnd of attention, while the father was out drinkin ; and here, to again quote a correspondent's words, she was
several tumes found lying quite helpless on the floor, stiff with cold, her clothes grown fast into the various sores of her body, which had been unwaffied since the time of removing her from Chapman's house. Her face and her body altogether gave her the appearance of something that was notnuman. When stripped of her clothes (which were barnt), the scabs which were torn off displayed beds of lice underneath them, and the offensive smell of her b1dy rendered it di'dicult to bear." It appears that while in this workshop, and also at Chapman's, her father had frequently beat her till blood flowed from her broken skin, using the most disgusting and filthy lan.uage, and telling her to die. The cause which more immediately led to the publicity of these dreadful transactions was as follows :-About a fortnight since screams were heard in the street, neighbours entered, and she was discovered lying on the hearth, the place filled with smoke, and red hot cinders burning th6 child's neck and breast, Rowland being at this time idling and drinking in the neighbourhood. The Rev. Mr. Daniels now at once had the child removed to a neighbour's house, and placed it under the medical care of Mr. W terbottom, of Carlton; but, although she now experiences all the attention that humanity and surgical skdll can suggest, her resto. ration to health is doubtful and the recovery of the use of herlimbs impossible. Rowandvasplcedbefore theChapel
en-le-Frith Bench on Thursday last, when sufficient evidence was adduced, principally from his own brother to bring the case under the act for punishing wife and ciden beaters, and he was sentenced to six months' imprisomment with hard labour, and then to find sureties for hs good behaviour for six months longer.-Derby Reporter.

Allen Beanish, 14, A ve sharp, intelligent-looking ad, was indicted for forging d uttering an order forthe payment of 51. 1Os. with intent to defraud.
Mr. Metcalfe prosecuted; the prisoner was defendedby Mfr. Payne.
* The clrcumstances connected with the charge were of rather a singular character. The prisoner, who was evidently a very clever boy, had been for nearly two years employed in the office of Mr. P&dley, a mining broker, i
Unioon-court Old Broad-street, and his master was in the habit of sending hi toahi ker!', the London and West-
inster Bank, Lothburyr, withchecks. It appeared that on the 14th of Februay Me. Padley sent him with a check for 56. to get it cashed, and the prisoner brought him back that amount, but it appeared that when the check was presented at the bankers? the word " ten" had been written into the body, and the figurs "1 " placed before the "0 " so that the checs appeared to be for bl. 10s. insted of b, the prisoner putting the-balance into his own pocket. It was sabsequently ascertained that four other forged checks (two for the amount of 41. and two for 31M) had beea paidby the bsnk, and when Mr. Padley sent for his passbook by the prisoner these checks and the one for 51. 10s. were placed in it, but the prisoner on his way home destroyed the whole of the forged checks, except-the one for 51. IOs, probably thinking that as this one bore his master's genuine signature no offence could 'o made out against him in respect of it. He was at once questioned upon the subject by his aster, and as his account was very unsatisfactory Ir. Padley locked him in hiu offlice, which is on the second floor, while he went to look for a policemnan and the.pri. soner's father - but upon his returh he found that the prisoner had made his escape out of the window, and there was a piece of paper on t'he table on whic'h he ha written, "1 I am gone; you Will see me no more. It appeared that on this same morning the prisoner had obtained cash for another forged check for 46., and that, fearing this money would be founa upon him, he had thrown itand some other money out of e window over a wallinto an idjoining yard, where it-was picked up by a neighbour. Theprisoner very shortly afterwards WAs seen to come over the same wall, and he told the person who saw him do so that his master had dropped the money out of hl poclket and he wanted toregairnospeesieci of It. A few days after this, inconsequence of some other facts that transpired, the prisonerwas taken into cnstodybya city policeman named Brown, who told him that he Tas accused of forgn checksin his master's name, and he re-
O adley has got nothing to halloo about, for he Las jot . 19s 6d. instead of 41." The officer subsequently assked hin how he came to think of forging his masste's nAme, and he aid, " Oh anybody can do that; he joins ital together, and I did the ssme. I can write a good deal better thau he can."
The prisoner, whose head reached only just above the bar, took notes during the trial, occasionally handed down suggestions in writing to his coumsel as to the questions to be put to the witnesses in quite a professional style, and did not exhibit the slightest appiearance of embarrassment.
The jury, without any hesitation, found the prisoner Guilty,
Mr. MxrcAr.r said, he regretted to have to inform the Court that the prisoner had been charged on a former occasion with obtaining money from a tradesman by representing that he had been sent by one of his customers.

NEW COURT.
(Before te CommoxN-SZRJANr.)
George Cnthbert Graham, dias Patsay, 21, bagebuilder; John Samuel Bennett, 36, lighterman; James Saunders, 16, labourer - and James Humphreys, 46, dealer, were indieted-the three first-named prisoners for stealing 2581b. of metal, valued at 131., the property of Edward Budd and others; and Humphreys with receiving thc same knowing it to have been stolen.
MVr. W. Cooper and Mr. Tindal Atkinson prosecuted;MIr. Ribton appeared for Bennett and Humphreys, and MIr. La^xton for Graham.
The case, which occupied the Court nearly the whole day, did not present any very novel or important features. The prosecutors are what is termed yellow metal manufacturers and coppe melters, of Castle Baynard-wharf, Upper Thamestee. Upon the 13th of February they conveyed to their agent at Rotterdam 300 yellow metal rods. These rods were placed on board a barge caled the Caroline to be shipped into the steamer going to Rotterdam, and Bennett, who was in the employ of the 3ighterman to the prose. cutors, hadthe rods counted out to him as he put them into the barge. They were taken on board the steamer without being counted, and a few days afterwards prosecutors received information that only 287 rods had been forwarded. The police were then informed of vwhat had occurred, and upon the 3d of March City Police-constable Gayler traced some of the metal to Messrm. Harton and Watts, Shoo-lane, who had bought it in the regular way of business from the prisoner Humphreys, who was known to them as a dealer in old metal, and whose address they gave to the constable. The police went to his house in King'sroad, Chelsea, and saw Humphreys, who denied that he had bought the metal or soldthat which the officerstraoedto Messrs. Xartonxand Watts, and which was most indisputably identified as being part of the gas bars in question. Against the prisoners Graham and Saunders there was only some evidence that they had admitted having had something to do with taking the bolts from the barge and conveying them to Chelea; while Bennett said he knew nothing about them.
The jury Acquited all the prisoners but Humphreys, and him they recommended to mercy.
The COaOrTN-SXRJNT said that but for the recommendation he should have passed a heavier sentence than he was about to do, and that was that prisoner be kept to hard labour for two years.

KAoIMoNusx.-Thomas Glass, formerly clerk in the service of fessrs. Northcott and Co., lace manufacture
carrying on business in Watllng-street, was bronght before Mhr. -Alaerman VRw cx upon remand, charged with forgery and with embezzling tho moneys of hislate em. ployers
hMr. Mulens, solicitor to the Committee of Banker for Protection from Forgeries and Fzauds, again appeared in support of the prosectution, and Mr. Wonher attended on the part of the prisoner1 who, it will be remembered, was delivered up by the polie tAthorities atBoulogne to Spittle, a CIty detective officer, a few days5 ago.
The risoer as rmaned fr e owf procurig the aendhFrancef *rs. Ball, who Mr lens aid was at
George Wakeling, a respectable-looldng young man, till vithin the last few days a clerk in the of ice of the English and Irish toTelegph Company, Cornhlll, was charged be-forethelonD M&yon with embezzling 204 a 2d., belonging to his employers.
It appeared from the evidence that nearly a fortnight ago the prisoner, who ws employed at the office of the company in Cornhill, had been sent by the superintendent to another offioe of the company, in Mark-lane, to perform duty for a clerk there who was absent from illness. In consequence of him not maidng his apperance at the office on Wednesday lat a fellow-clerk named Eedes was deopatohed to the lodgngs of the
rionr ho asho compgained of ilness, and who hadjust *d e aepplied to head. The prioner had made up his books, which showed a balance in hand of 271.13s. 2d., and, upon his telling Mr. Bedes that he was unable to go to business, the latter asked him for the key of his drawer in which the cash was kept This drawer upon being opened in the preence of witnesses, was found to contain only 71 lOs. The prisoner, upon Its being meutioned to him that the drawer contained only 7. 101. instead of 27& IsL 2d., expressed much surprise and declared that when he quitted the premises on aturday last the larger amount was safely locked up in it. It having come to the knowledge of the proeccutors that at the time of the prisoner's absence from business on the plea of illness he had not been confined to his bed, but had, notwithstanding the application of leeches to bis head, kept irregulnV hours athis odgings andent a day at the Crystal Paltce, they felt themselves justifiedin giving him into custody uponthe charge of embezzlement.
Mr. Wontner, who appeared for the risoner, eliited from two of the witnesses that the accuseg'had complained a good deal of illness duringthe few days he was occupied at the office in Mark-lane. The prisoner persisted in the correctnems of his story, that when he left the premisre vious to his illness he left the 27L 13s. 2d. safely locked up in his drawer.
The prisoner, who had been four years in the service of the prosecutors, and who during that time had borne a good character, was remanded, but hail was aocepted for hi appearanoo at the next examination.
WoBswrPsTRxEr.- James Booking, a master wheelwright in good business, was charged with being drunk sad assaulting the polhe.
EGlton, a constable of the K division, stated that while on duty in Essex-street Hackney, at 1 in the morning, the defendant and others began fighting, and, on his taking hold of him and trying to get him away, the defendant collared him and struck him several times on the ribs. Do. fendaut still held him by the collar, and exclaimed, " You -, where were you when my gates were broken opena
He told him to be quiet and release his hold, or he mast strike him, and as the defendant would not leave go of his collar he at last struck him with his truncheon, and a gentleman having gone for another constable the defendant was at last secured and lodged in the station.
Witt, another officer, stated that a gentleman having come up to'him and sad, "Policeman, make haste, there is a brother constable in serious trouble in Essex-street," he went there, and near the railway found the last witness in a stableyard, holding the defendant- by the arm, and the defendant holdg him by the collar. The defendant was intoxicated, and they were struggling together. Others were there who seemed attempting to rescue the defendant. He did not see the officer strike the defendant with his staff, but on seeing him with his lamD in his hand the defendant pointed to his forehead aud saiW to witness " See what he has done." The defendant was intoxicated, but went quietly to the station.
Sergeant Lewis deposed to being at the station when the defendant was brought in, and he then noticed that he had a cut over one of his eyes.
This was the case for the police, and in answer to it the defendant, whose forehead had been laid open with a severe blow from a truncheon, and who complained that he had been scandalousl; used, called Mr. Thomas Rickman, a plumber and glazmer, who stated that on hearing a noise in the street about 1 o'clock in the morning he got up, and on looking out of window saw two men fighting. The defendant was not one of the combatants, but as theywere fighting opposite the defendant's stable he appeared to be trying to separate them. The officer at that moment came Iu, pushea the defendant away, and told him to go home. We defendant replied, "I am going home; I am now going to see my horses rubbed down; but where were you when my gates were broken open?' The moment he said this the offlcer rushed in at kim, and witness heard what ho thought was a blow strack. Defendant had not hold of the officer's collar when he made the observation about his place boing broken into, but was inside his own gates.
In answer to the magistrate the witneas said, the constable was three or four foot off when the remark was made. When the defendant and officer came out of the yard, the defendant said, pointing to his head, " What have I done to deserve this t" The constable said, "I know you and your character." The defendant was not fighting and is not a quarrelsome man. The defendant appealed about his head to the people round, and said, "Yoe see what he has done" in a sort of complaining way.
Richard Dexter, a wheelwright in the service of the defendant, said, while waitng for h master two men got
pushed him towards his owanstnabeles,followedohim in, struck him on the head, and then putilled him out. The defendant had not hold of the constable by the collar, or anywhere else.
Mr. EHA,iLL said, he considered that most unwrrant able violence had been used upon the defendant in this case If, indeed, it was nece take the defendant at all, it was quito possible to take him without any such conduct as ha been proved here, and he should therefore order the defendant to be at onoe discharged
THAS.-EB. Lee, 25, a notorious thief and stree't Walker, was charged with stealing a silver watch and gold guard chain from the person of Frederick Vandyke, the mate of a ship.
The compliaant stated that he was passin along Cannon-street-road, St. George's-in-the3bast, on Fiday nlght, at10o'clock,when ho was accostedbytheprisoner, who struck him and made a snatch at his watch. He pushed her away, and she made a second grasp at his watch and dragged it from his waistcoat-pocket and broke the gold chain. -e immediately seized the prisoner, and she made a desperate resistance and tried to bite him. In the struggle they both fell down, when some ruffianly-looking fellows near kim called out, Leave the woman alone P" and they were about to attack him when a polioeman come up. The watch was found in the WAsoners hand.
Roche, tho gaoler, a id that she was a most dangerous thief, and had been convicted some time ago of a similar offence, and was generally astisted by male accomplioes She had been repeated in custpdy.
The prisoner pleaded guilty, on which the magistrate told her that if itha nb pbeezt n that the pro.ecutor was
gong away with his ship before the next semsions of the Krimial Court, he woulid have committed her for trial as it was, he should send her to prison for six months, with hard labour.

)IILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
The iron steam troopship Transit, Commander Ennis Chambers, was removed from the steam basin in Portslnouth Dockyard and placed alongside the Bellerophon hulk orn Saturday to reship her stores, provisions, &c., and to reembark her troops. Tho provisions, we are 1I4aa to report, were found damaged only to an inconsiderable extent, the influx of water having been confined only to the two fore compartments of the ship. It is currently reported that the ship was detained by a little jobbery leAt week, or she might -have left Portsmouth earlier, and have avoided, in aR t'asman probability, the necesity for anchoring befora 0-earing the western passage to the Noedles. We give this exactly as it has been convoyed to us, wihonat vetching for its authenti,ity b-t we are in possession df a few facts which appear to give a colomig to:smh a repcrt. The ship appeared to be weniventilated, and to failt was found with the existing Ineans, 'butt xaofflicialthought stx more ventilatrs woulid be ean improvenent, and six wren conseauently unfitted frora the gunbeat fidtilla the same night, as there were none in tatoreaghere. Thece were'ndt fitted tothe Transit before an order was receivefl to-supp!y her with some of a new invention by Mr. Wctson, of Halifax, to which place they had 'to be telegaphed for. 'lais gave double work to the fitters -on boartd the ship, " doing and undoing," as is the
-' way *they have 'ix the Navy." It is remarked 'that the new arti;le -does not appear likely to prove so ,efficieit-asthose inmgneral use, nor so easily msde ged if defeotive. It wiU -consequently prove an additional-expense in -the long run -beyond tho fact of being more costly to cstart wit. Thoe'Himalaya is being supplied with 10 of the same sort. Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Nspier, MYP., was in the dockyard or} Saturday taking notes of these ship3, so it is. possible the ventilators may be further ventilated. 'The Himalaya was supposed to be the most admirably ventilated 'roopship-afloat, whether for cavalry or infantry. No -necessity for -.iring her decks was discovered at Plymontb, ,where she wee last fitted oat, but on her arrival at Ports. -nouth to-raceive her troops she is delayed for this purpose.
The paddle frigate Furious, 16, Captain Sherard Osborne, ,B., 'redy to go to Spithead. The Drake andJames guuboats are also nearly ready, and the Firm will leave dock this day. These vessels it is expected will be convoyed to Chtina by the Furious. The Cormorant, 4, steam despatch gun vessel, Commander Saumarez, will also eoon be ready. She hauled alongside ier hulk to ship stores, &c., on Saturday afternoon.
The'Turkish screw frigate Geyvan Babri will leave Liver]ool 'for Constantinople to-day (Monday). She has been ntted,,st the former port, by Air. Laird, with a lifting 'screw and steam machinery.
The etoam troopship Lebanon, Captain Cook, havine embarked the four companies of Royal Artillery, as detailed in D7ise TiPw, sailed from Woolwich pier on Saturdav at 3 o'clock for Canada asd Halifax. Major-General Sir W, E. Wiiams, attended by his aide-de-camp and thegarrison stat, and accompanied by Brigade-Major Shaw, made a careful inspection of the several compartments of the vessel, and expressed himself highly satisfied with the auperior accommodation afforded by the Lebanon for the ,comfort and convenience of the troope. The Mooresfort -and the Neleus sailing transports, destined to take out the four Artillery companies to China, have likewise anchored ,alongside the pier at Woolwich Arsenal, and are making preparations to sal to-morrow.
The Violet freight ship, Captain Paton, partly laden with Etores for Hongkong, ad bent sails and terminated her Arrangements to heave anchor at the commencement of the week, but in consequence of the delay in the transport from the military store department she will probably not sail for six or eight days. Two magazines capable of holding 51 and 21 tons of ammunition have been erected, as well as extra cabins for the accommodation of the officers of the military store department and the medical corps ordered to take passage in the Violet.
Her Majesty's iron screw steam gunvessel Minx, Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Roe, arrived at Woolwich on Saturday from Africa, last from Portsmouth, and toge ther with the Baun and Brune (the crews of the latter hnevingbeen turned overto the Leven and the Slaney) isto be retained in ordinary, all standing. The paddlewbeeL steam-essel Adder, in charge and tow of one of the dockyard hulks, laden with machinery and boats for Sheerness, left Woolwich on Saturday. The Admiralty yacht Bansbee returned to Woolwich on Saturday, having conveyed the Persian envoy and suite from Dover to Calais.

EXPLOSI(ON AT THE HOrNSLOW POWDER-MTLES.- An accident of a fearful character, attended with a great destruction of property and weU nigh fatal consequences to a number of persons, took place on Saturday last at a few minutes after noon in the premliises belonging to Messrs. Curtis and Hlarvey, gunpowder marufacturers to the Government, &c., at Hounslow. Seine four or five hands, principally youths, were engaged in what is techni ;Aiy termed the comrn osition mill, a building not more t tan 3( feet long, which contained a great quantity of sailpetre, sulphur, and other articles used in mak,og guntpowder. Three of tho lads employed in theo mill had their attention directed to the rorth-west end of the building by seeing a blue, but at first a slow light flickering around the piace. linowing at once what wvas likely to ensue among so much combustible matter, an instant cry of " Firo !" and " liun for your lives" was raised. Thevarious persons who were then in the place made an attempt to run out, and three werefortunate enough to succeed in reaching the open ground, but the other two met the "blast" as they were running away, the heat of which severely scorched thcm, and considerably injured the foot and heel of one, and at the sante instant the whole of the etock in tho place becoming ignited went off, blowing the roof away. A lad named Varwick was struck on the head and severely injured by -. beam faling. This lad lost his father in the same prernises about three months azo, but it is only rilt to nteution that the firm have since allowed his mother a week-ly pension, which they always do to the faiilies of any who lose their life in their service. Before the extent of the mischief done in the composition turU could beascertained twoe..plosions followed, far inreserious than the first,which blew two of the mils *t,iost to ruius. The engines of the firm having basii got out wero set to work frons the mill strewtus un the grounds, and the fire was soon subdued, but not until the mill in wliich the disaster commenced was burnt down and its conitents consumed, the loss of which is not very considerable; but the contents of the two otber insills which were worked by steam and water power, being riddled, and the machinery severely injured, the total loss will be something rather serious. 'rhe business of the firmn will be able, owing to the many other mills on the ground, to be carried on as usual. hIr. Curtis, the head of the firm , and also Mr. Asbby, the manager, were in ilnmaediate attendauce, aiid gave orders that everything necessary should be done for the two injured lads.
THE GLAS(:OIV POiSOSINC CASE.-MjiSS Mjadeleine S9.nth, the young lady who (as stated in a recent nuonber of
'hc Tinms) was apprehended on the suspici.m of having administered poison to her sweethpart, 3 young French gentleman nanued L'Angelier, was formally committed on Frday last to stand her trial on the charge of nurder. The result has been arrived at after the consultation with the Crown anthorities in Edinburgh. So far as motive is concerned, the grounds of the charge are understood to be that M iss Smith was anxious to cast L'Angelier off in consequence of having received and accepted an offer of marriage from a gentlenisan who occupies a much more elevated position in society, so far as wealth is concerned. L'Angelier was resolved to maintain h-s ascendancy, and had some power of blasting the young lady's reputation in the event of her marrying his rival. Esence the catastrophe. That the young lady procured arsenic ahout the time of L'Angelier's deatb, that he died from the effects of arsenic, and that there is no reaFon to believe he committed suicide, are mnatters undoubted. The event haseseated much excitement dr Glasgow.

Handel Festival, Crystal Palace.
hANDBL FESTIJrAL, CBYSTAL PA-LAVE.
This important undertaking gradually advances, and pro. I mises a result, which, if the festival of 1857 is to be simply
a preliminary essay, to test the possibility of sti grdaterj| things in 1859 (the centenary anniversary of Handel's death), will lead to expectations with respect to the latter by no means easy to realize.
During the last few weeks material progress has b'en made. The metropolitan division of the chorus, appoi ated under the direction of sub-committees for each vocal, pat -these sub-committees receiving aid and counsel frr,Tm competent professional advisers-has terminated in the, selection of 1,100 picked voices. Each spplcant for a piace in the chorus,before beingadmitted, bht.beentriedatt}epianoforte, the compass and quality of voices, profic-ency at sight. reading, andotheresseritijl gifts being registered, so as to anarantee the 6itimate cheice of the most efficient. The "1,100'' have already paso the ordeal of two rehearsals at
.xeterxhall, under the 'wmperintendence of Mr. Costa, in chorsses of larad. -v Egypt and The Messiah respectively; and on 'Wednesday evening the third oratorio, Jueas .Afaccduew, willl'e submitted to a similar experiment. The effect produced in the first-mentioned oratorios was Ironounced by-all prsent to be more than satisfactory. The provincial brancheseg the chorus are forming in the principal cities and towns df Great Britain under the guidance of pro. -fessors and amateurs of acknowledged ability.
The numbers *nd distribution of the orchestra are already determined on. There will be 76 first violins, 74 second 'Violins, IO viola5, 60 violoncellos, and 50 double-basses (in .all 3030 stringed instraments); 9 flutes, 9 oboes, 9 clarionets, 9 bassoon8, 12'horns, 12 trumpets and cornets, 9 trombone., 3 ophicleides, 9 serpents and bass-horns, 3 drums, and 6 sidedrums (90 wind instruments)-a force hitherto unprece.
The organ, constructed expressly for the occasion by Messrs. Gray and Davison, will be one of great power and on an appropriately gigantiC scale. The instrument being nearly in a state of comtnletion, the swell and great organs were recently tried in the manufactory ; but, as there was not space enough even in the very extensive premises of the makers to put up the pedal organ, it could not be heard on that occasion. Wat was tested, however, was unanimously approved by the connoisseurs present. The organ wiil occupy a pltform in the Crystal Palace of 40 feet wide by24 deep, which will not only afford s -ffi cint room for the pipes to speak, but ample passage betweeu each divLsion, so that any depa-tment of the immeose harmonious structure can be approached without diffculty and at an instant's notice. The employment of I'"pneumatic" action vwill insure immediate response to the touch, and thus materially assist the exertions of the performance. The erection of the organ at the Crystal Palace is to begin on Wednesday morning. Tho *eight of the new instrament will be somewhere about 20 tons, wbich, as it is toremain a fixture, wi demand a pLatform of the most solid and durable nature. A list of the stops, &O., may probably interest the vast number of our readers who are either players upon the organ, or admirers of it. as the chief instrumental representative of sacred music. We therefore append the following resunW, premising that it has four rows of keys-CC to A in alt.

Of its absolute quality we must take another occasion to speak, since that can only be adjudged by oral experience in the locale for which it is destined.
The orchestra, already completed, occupies a space of 168 feet in width (just 38 feet wider than Exeter-hall), and 90 feet in depth. The seats for the performers are gradually raised, one above another, so that every instrumentalist and vocalist can have a full view of their conductor. The band will be in front, the chorus at the back. The aspeet presented by this gigantic superstructure, when crowded from roof to base with singers and players, can hardly fail tobe one of the most'imposing description. The wholeis contrivedonthe most approved principles for the insuring strength and resistance, The beams of timber, screwed and bolted together (there are no nails), with their stage and struts and bearings, ,resent the appearance of a complete forest of woodwork. she twoupper rows, allotted to the instrumental department of the orchestra, will be consigned to the double-basses, &c. Between these and the seats intended for the chorus there is a broad avenue for passage to and fro. In short, the accommodation is so judiciousl arranged that every singer and player will be thoroughly at ease, and thus better able to give to the en-smble the benefit of his talents, under favourable and comfortable circumstances. A photograph of the orchestra, by Messrs. Nogretti, is on view, and affords a capital notion of its appearance and proportions.
IJp to this moment we are informed that public curiosity has been excited to an unusual extent, and that the disposal of vouchers, entitling possessors to a preference in the choice of places when the regular tickets are issued, has been far greater than was even anticipated. We shall further report progress as occasion offers.

TO TEt EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-I have bWen much surprised at reading in T7he Times of yesterday a letter from Mr. Lionel Gisborne on this subject, because an azrangement was come to on the 28th ult. that this correspondence should cease. On that day your City Editor had agrecd to publish a letter from Mr. Gisborne in answer to mine of the 18th ult., and also my reply to it, when Mr. Gisborne's solicitor (Mr. Lavic) in his client's presence, and, of course, with his sanction, withdrew such letter, and authorized me to inform your City Editor, which I did, that there should be no more newspaper correspondence on the subject.
I havc a eat disinclination to intrude upon your pace, but you wiiL I am suro, allow mc to make a brief reply to Mr. Gisborne's statements, which are most incorrect. In my letter of the 18th of March I quoted (and correctly quoted) two documents subscribed by MIr. Gisborne, and I invited your readers and yourself to agree in the inferences I drew from them. The fact, of which at the time I was unaware, that the letter so quoted was not addressed to Mr. Andrew, in no way affects the merits of the question, as it was written in order to be submitted, and it was submitted, to him, and it formed tho basis of the agreement I subsequently made with Mr. Gisborne. That agreement is correctly quoted by me, and your City Editor was furnished with copies of it and of the letter. The wordsomitted from Article 7 do not, as you will see, affect the sense and meaning of the passage I quoted.
That the purchase of Mr. Gisborne's concession was made with the view of getting rid of a competing line, and, as suggested by Mr. Gisborne himself, of bringing all the support upon the other line, is sufficiently obvious fron c correspondence, and the fact that the purchaser nad no other motive for listening to MIr. Gisborne's overtures. The purchaser complains, and with much justice, that Mr. Gisborne should immediately after the execution of the agreement revive a project, the abandonment, or at least the suspension of which was his inducement to enter into the bargain. In reply to repeated protests against the course Mr. Gisborne was taking I received a letter from his solicitor, stating his impression to be (irrespective of anything he had heard ar a matter of stipulation) that the purchaser has " a moral right to insist that nothing should be done down the Red Sea until he had either failed in his agreement, or until it is clear that the Eu hrates valley line will fail."
There are other statements in Mr. Gisborne's letter which are inaccurate, but I do not notice them, as they do not affect the issue between us. I should not have troubled you had not Mr. Gisborne sought to impeach my veracity, and it is not my intention to continue the correspondence further,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Case Of Alleged Assault.
I CASE OF ALLEGED ASSAULT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In justice to an old man who has hitherto borne an irreproachable character for propriety of conduct, and who is 76 years of age, instead of 66, as stated, I trust to your goodness to put the following explanation of the case of your report of what took place at the Marlborough-street police-ofce yesterday into your deservedly widely-spread paper. I was charged by an elderly woman in a shop, as stated, with a gross act of indecency, and at first I understood I was to be bound over to the guarter sessions, bat when my bail arrived I found the magistrato had sentenced me to be bound over to keep the peace towards this woman for 12 months. I do not know what may have influenced the magistrate in the case, except it may have been the very great improbability of such a circumstance taking place with so many other women in the shop and so near at hand, and no witnesses caUed; and I may add, though it did not at the moment occur to me, that two men were taLking at the other end of the shop, and were in sight of me as I stood with my umbrella in my hand within two or three yards of a double glass swing-door, with the sun shining into it and people passing to and fro, about 1 o'clock in the day.
I cannot imagine what delusion had taken place in the woman's mind, but, as defendants are not allowed to be sworn in their case, I now solemnly affirn and declare that I am not guilty of the charge preferred against me, so help me God. I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant.

Long Leases.
LONG LEASES.
TO THM EDITOB OF THE TImEs.
S-;-The subject of loDg leases is often discussed in newsPD ers and agicultural journals, but I think both sides of 4ie question re seldom fairly taken Into ccomnt. Scotland is often alluded to, and the advantages of the system proved as seen in its effects in that country. When we take into considertion the fact that most of the landlordsof that country are resident for a long period of the year in England, and that to them the great question is the amount of
rent to be obtained from their estates, one can easily, believe no better means than long leases at raclrents could have been devised, though I think many reasons would make me, if a Scotch landlord, hesitate to let a farm in good condition for a long period. If a farm in an un-
improved state is to be got into a high state of. cultivation by other capital than the owner's, it must ho let at a moderate rent for a long period to a man of property, who ought to be under no zestrictions, at any rate for the greater Part of the lease. But there are many farms in a good state of cultivation, but yet capable of great improvement; and how stands the argument with respect to them ? First ask the landlord if he has any objection to grant a lease of, say, 21 years; and he will answer, perhaps, that he has a decided objection, because rent is not the only object with him ; he wants an agreeable tenant, and may, perhaps, have a man who, if quite independent of him, may turn out a very disagreeable neighbour. Many persons see no force in this argument who would be the first to appreciate its correctness if placed in the position of the landlord. Then, again, he may say, " I have laid out a large snm of money to improve this farm, and might obtain as tenant a man who would neglect the outfalls of the drains, beggar the land, allow the buildings to go out of repair, an d as long as he paid his rent, &o., I should be compelled to see my property go to wreck." You may suggest that in such a case be would have made a very bad choice, and he might reply " that he could not, if he selected a good tenant in every respect, insure his living 21 years, nor say who would succeed him." A landlord would, perhaps, think, though he might not say it, that in addition to these reasons he might at *ome time wish to sell or exchange a part or the whole of his farm, or he might require a part for some purpose of improvement, or to carry out someplan for thebeauti. fying of his estate, and he will not tie up his hands for so long a period; and as to rent, if the making of money had been his only object, he could have done much better than invest his capital in land. If you use the argument that his land is likely to be improved by a tenant with capital, and that it would be Improved in value at the end o! the lease, he may say "It is in good condition now, and, though Mr. - is a clever farmer and would probably do a good deal in tho first part of his lease, yet, if he is a sensible man, he will take care of himself towards the close, and no one will blame him if he tries to take out of the land what he has put in
and, though I might prevent this by renewing the lease, I have, as far as my enjoyment of the land goes, sold it for an indefinite time for so much a-year." But wewil suppose he agrees to grant the lease, and yoa go to the tenant and say, " 'Why do you not take your farm on a lease; your landlord is wiling to grant one ?" I have heard many farmers replysomething in this manner, " I am quite contented to remain as I am ; this farm is high rented and in pretty good condition, and pays me a fair return for the labour bestowed on it, but if I had a long lease it would preclude me from taldng a larger and better one when my capital was sufficient for the purpose or mY boys old enough to help me; besides, as a yearly tenant I can give up my farm if prices fall and my landlord will not lower his rent. My landlord does not interfere with W7 management, as he sees the land, if nob much improved, is not going back, so I farm as I like, while, if I took a lease, the lawyer or agent, to protect, as ho would say, the landlord, would try to tie me down to some course of cropping, and, whatever improvements were made in farming, I could make none." These, and similar reasons, I have heard often given.
NTow, is there no middle course between a yearly tenure and a long lease? I think there is, and would suggest a three years' notice to quit on each part, and will state some of what I suppose its advantages, The tenant would farm tilhe got notice to quit as if he were farming his own land; for he would argue that, being entirely free from restrictions, he could take out what he had put in during the three years, though all farmers are aware that if land v s poor it cannot be got into good heart in three years ; nor could it, if in high condition, be much injured in that time. If it were worth while for a tenant to tako land at all, he would hardly object to do so for so short a time as three years, nor can I see any objec. tion to be urged on the part of the landlord. In case of receiving notice of a tenant's intention to leave his farm, he has three years to fix on the best man to succeed him in the occupation, and, as it cannot be denied that many tenants have received great injury from being obliged to leave their farms without having time to fix on another, the advantage would be as great on their side. How many a misunderstanding between good landlords and good tenants arising out of mere tefes would be arranged if three years instead of one were allowed for passion to give place to cool reflection !
The advantages of this plan, though to me they appear numerous, are also so obvious that I think it unnecessary to state them more in detail; its adoption would, I believe, be of great advantage to the country.
Yours, obedientlv.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIEJrS.
Sir,-The refugees, Democrats Socialists of the commune r6voutcionnaire, have intrusted me with the task of offering to you some observations referring to your last leader on the secret societies in France.
You are quite right, Sir, in asserting that the aim of those societies is the advent of the Socialist Domocracy. To that point we have no objection, and entirely agree with you.
But it is no more so when you say that the insurrection of 1848 had already brought the Socialist Democracy to power. Both for truth and history's sake we feel it our duty to answer that never in 1848, neither before nor after, the Socialist Democracy was in power; onthecontrary, they have always been in direct opposition and in open contest with power from 1848 to the present day-from the Provisional Government to the Empire-from Lamartine to Bonaparte.
If you choose to be just, even towards Socialist Democrats, you will admit our statements-three, among others, only three, short and good.
To whom has the revolution of 1848 given the power ? To Lamartine first, then to Cavaignac, and at last to Bonaparte.
Are those Socialist Democrats? Canyou hold as a Democrat the less reactionary of these three, Lamartine himself, who, you say in this very leader, found your own country too revolutionary for his taste ?
What the Socialist Democracy aimed at was and is the radical revolution at home and abroad-the enfranchisement of labour and the freedom of all the people.
Against M. Lamartine,-who, in his manifesto of the 5th of March, proclaimed the principle of non-interventionthe Socialist Democracy protested on the 15th of May, asking war for Poland's sake. BarbUs, Blanqui, and Raspail were in prison for that.
Against h. Cavaignac and the like, who dispersed the ateliers nationaux, the Socialist Democracy protested on the 24th of June, asking for work or death. Ten thonsandwork. men were shot or transported to Lambessa for that.
Against AL Bonaparte,President,who violated the constitution by his attack on the R.oman Republic, the Socialist Democracy protested on the 13th of June, 1849, for the solidary sovereignty of the peoples. Thirty-six represent. ants and all the Republican journalists were exiled for that.
At last, against M. Bonaparte-turned to an E1mperor by la grace du coup d'stat-the Socialist Democracy made its last protestation on the barricades, on the scaffold, and under the sun of Cayenne. Dussoubs was shot, Charlet guillotined, and Miot and a great number of citizens were sent to the galleys for that.
You see, Sir, instead of power, the Socialist Democracy had shots, prison, exile, guillotine, and galleys. You will, I trust, confess it is not precisely the same.
Your sense of fair play will, we hope, allow the present claim of the Socialist Democrats to their real share, which it would be inconsistent to deny them, after having so often asserted that they have well deserved it.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

There is usually such an assemblage on holydays. In the course of the evening there was a fight, and the police interfered, but the mob attacked them. Some of the constables were severely injured, large flint stones having been tbrowa at them. Two of the rioters were examined before the magistrates on Saturday. The evidence was insufficient to show that the injuries sustained by the police were the personal acts of the prisoners, thongh two distinct assaults were proved against each of them, and they were fined 20!. for ach assault, aund in default of payment were committed for two months. at the expiration of which time they are to he further imprisoned for two months, with hard labour.

The Colliery Explosion At Lundhill.
THE COLMERY BXPLOSION AT LLUU, -JIILL.
,A short timne since we tated tbat it was not unlikely that some of the bodies might rise and floit to the surface of the ,Nater in the shaft. Oar antioiPationd-have been xealized
and Vie lirst body was found between U and 12 o'clack oai
-riday night. The men employed in connexionk with the 1raing out of the water work eight hour shifw, and every tirae they commience their shifts they descend to the surface of the water to wee if any bodies have rsen, orif there is any ddris wants removing. For this
pose, alittle after 11 o'clock on Friday night, John %rhurst, Wilham Beevors, and John South, the milen on duty, descended, and observed something floating on the waetr, which on closer examination proved to be tho remains of one of the unfortunate men. They immediately came out of the fhaft and mLde preparations for bringing out the remains, and again descended with a quantityof cotton, which they Placed in the water and drew under the body, by which they brought it out of the shaft. The spectacle presented was of a most awful oharacter. The features were frightfully distorted, the legs and arms bro. ken, the feet cut off, and the head and other parts so crushed as to render it the appearance of one shapeless mass of flesh, and entirely unrecognizable. The remains were carefully placed in a coffin and removed to the shed etected for the purpose of receiving tho bodies, where it will remain till viewed by the coroner and jury.
The intelligence of the recovery created quite a sensation in the neighbourhood.
The body, when brought out, was in a far advanced state of decomposition, and, although disinfectants were freely used, the operation of bringing it out and placing it in the coffin made one of the men engaged in the task il
After the body had been brought out sorne hours were spent in repairing the conductors, which had been damaged at the bottom of the shaft by the explosion, and it was not until 3 o'clock in the morning that the operations of drawing the water again fairly commenced. At 11 o'clock on Saturday it was found that the water had lowered within one foot of the chair which is imbedded a' the bottom, and as one of the buckets only could fill, and the conductors wanted repairing, a stoppage of six or seven hours again took place, or there is no doubt but by Saturday evening the water would have been mnroofed.
The height of the water in the shaft is now about nine feet, and this, if no great delay takes place in removing the chair and c6ris at the bottom, wil be got out in a few days.
The action of the buckets when dipping and coming out of the water, now it has so nearly reached the bottom, is such as to be likely to cause other bodies to rise to the surface, to meet which emergency a number of coffins are ready for immediate use.
The graves at Darfield and other places are now nearly completed. About 160 of the bodies (if so many can be recovered) are to be interred at Darfield The graves are made sumciently deep to hold several coffins, which will bce placed one above another, a layer of bricks being placed be-
twen the different tiers. In the centre will be placed a mnonument bearing the names of the men and the cause of their death.
Frightful Explosion At Stockport.
.FIGHTFUL I AT STOCKPORT.
STOCIKPORT, Ax'sm IL.
The Bredbury New Pit belongs to Messrs. J. and J. Jowett, who are also the owners of two otber pits in the immediate neighbourhood. The pit at which the explosion ocaurred has only been opened for about six months, and it is not even yet worked to its ful extent. The number of mnen employed in it at present is only 12, but there is also a imilar number of boys.
This morning the colliers assembled, as usnal, at 6 o'clock at the mouth of the pit, and they were let down in the "cages," and nothing wrong was at that time noticed. The shaft is 157 yards deep, and when the men arrived at the bottom they dispersed in various directions and prOceeded with their work. The part of the mine 'which is known as the No. 7 level was worked by Samuel Platt, who was assisted by a boy named Hopwood. It the next, o tNo. 6 level, were William Holworth (sometimes called Whitehead) and ha two sons, Joseph and SamueL Everthing proceeded as usual till about a quarter to 7 oclocTwhen a loud explogion took place in the No. 7 level, workea by Platt. The explosion was heard not only in every
art f the pit but also for some distanco in the neighbourhood. The fire rushed along the various workings, and frightfully burnt those of the coliers who had not taken the precaution to throw themselves ontheir faces. The distance from the bottom of the shaft at which the explosion occurred was 78 yards. Platt, who was frightfully burnt and bruised, contrived to crawl to the shaft's mouth. The lad Hopwood attempted to folow him, but missed his way, auid fel a distance of 30 feet, thereby severely injnuring his back. He, nevertheless, by some miraculots means, gropd his way to the mouth of the shaft. The occupants of 0 . 6 level, William Holworth and his two sons, were not so fortunate. Tho father and his two boys were both kulled, not it is supposed, by the fire, hut by the choking vapours which succeeded the explosion, As we have said the report of the explosion was heard by the inhabitants residing in the localty, and a large number of persons were quickly on the spot. Without a moment's delay the cage was hoisted and the living men were taken up from the shaft, many of them being horribly disfigured by burning. After nearly an hour had elapsed all were thus talken out, with the exception of the Holworth.s Au unfortunate delay then occurred in consequence of the sulphur having becomo so strong in the pit as to prevent the men going down. At length, however, ventilation was so far restored as to enable them to descend, and shortly after 10 o'clock the bodies of Holworth and his sons were recovered, The father breathed once after he was taken out., but the two sons were quite dead. Of the other men five were severely wounded, most of them being both burnt and bruised. Thneir names are :-Samuel Platt, burnt, and very much bruised about the head; Richard Lomas, ribs broken, bruised about the head, and burnt: John Andrew, frightful injuries on the head and burns; Thomnas Redfern,very much burn4t Henry Hopwood (boy), dreadfully burnt, and injured ~y his fall.
There is very little doubt that the lamentable accident was caused by the culpable negligenes o£ Platt in working with his naked candle. Some of the workmen assert that he did not use a lamp at all, though one is provided for each man but we believe Platt himself says that he had a lamp, but that he removed the top of it, and that the explosion took place immediately. There is no fireman employed in this pit to go down and examine the workings before the men commenced work. There is a general manager named George Way, who goes down into the pit generally every day to see that all is right. He states that
he made a thorough examination of it on Wednesday last and that there was then no damp. He also made a partiai examination on Thursday, but did not then sIhit the No. 7 level, worked by Platt. Good Friday followed, and the men did not work, so that the mine had rot been thoroughly examined for two days. No accidert of this rature has occurred in the neighbourhood for many years, and this, perhaps, made the men less cautious. Platt, it is said, has been a collier for upwards of 20 years.
The wounded men have been removed to their homes, and are attended by surgeons, but it is feared that some of them cannot survive their injuries, which are of a very frlglktful nature. The coroner for the district has been communicatedwith,and he has fLed MYonday next for opening the inquest. It is probable, however, that the inquiry willbe adjourned to enable the Government InspeCtOr to vist the mine.
Another Colliery Explosion.
ANOTHER COLLIERY EXPLOSION.
SWANSEA., AsRIni 10.
An explosion of firedamp occurred last nighb at the Gorse Coliery, the property of Messrs. Richards and Glasbrook, whereby three persons were killed and several others seriously injured.
It appears that the men who were to take the night turn proceedee' to their work as usual, at 6 o'clock, and that nothing extraordinary happened until about 11 o'clock, -when one of the men engaged in the pit proceeded to a part of the work where it was necessary that safety lamps should be used. He carried a safety lamp himself, but for some reason he had taken the cap off, so that the light was exposed. Some of his fellow-workmen, it is said, remonstrated with him upon his conduct, and requested him to replace the cap, but he paid no attention to their injunctions, and the consequence was that the air, which was of a highly imflammable nature, became ignited, and an explosion took place.
As soon as it was known that an explosion had tal-en place in the pit, measures were immediately taken to ascertain its extent and to afford aSSistance to those engaged in the colliery. Mr. Joseph Evans, the agent to the colliery, and a man named John Matthews, descended into the pit, and the whole of the persons employed at the time, vith the exception of four, were sent to the mouth of the pit in safety. Six of these it was found had suffered from the effects of the explosion, being aU more or less burnt, some of them having received severe contusions in contequence of the violence with which they were thrown against the sides of the pit or other objects in their immediate neighbourhood.
As soon as these persons were removed, Mr. Evans and John Matthews proceeded to search for those who were missing, but had not gone far before they were overcome by the afterdamp, and fell down in a state of exhaustion. They were speedily removed to a place where the air was more pure, andupon their recovezy thu search was resumed;
hours their efforts to rescue the unfortunate men were fruitless, and when at length they succeeded it was found that three of the poor fellows were past hopes of recovery, having been suffocated by the choke, or afterdamp. The names of the men are :-John Griffiths, aged 35; and John Mort, 16; and a lad, John Knight, 13. The fourth, a lad named Stephens, about 14 years of age, was found to be insensible, but upon proper remedies being resorted to he recovered his consciousness, and hopes are entertained that he wiU not long suffer from the effects of the explosion, as he is but slightly burnt. This lad might have escaped without injury, but seeing a companion about his own ago (John Knight, who was klhed) lying upon the ground insensible, he nobly resolved to stay behind to render him assistauce if possible, but the gallant little fellow was hlmself soon rendered insensible by the afterdamp, and it is miraculous how he escaped being suffocated. John Griffiths, the oldest of the sufferers, might, it is said, also have escaped, but in the confusion of the moment he went in an opposite direction to that which he should have taken, and tnus met the volurxe of flame which was advancing. When discovered his body presented a frightful appearance, being completely charred. The bodies were removed to the respective homes of the deceased for the coroner's inquest,
THuNDERsTO%s.-On the evening of Good Friday, about half-past 7 o'clock, a thunderstorm burst over Wakefield and the surrounding townships. The thunder claps were accompanied by vivid flashes of lightning and heavy rain. The rain for the last week or two has been so incessant as to cause the rivers and streams to overflow their banks. On Westgate-common, the lower portion of Wakefield, the ground floors of the houses were inundaued, driving the inhabitants to the upper stories. About 50 or 60 yards of astrong brick wall an front of Messrs. Marriott's mill was completely swept away, and articles of household furniture were floating aboutin the stream. Aceverethunder. storm broke over the southern coast of Northtmberlqnd on the afternco of Good Friday. The lightning was very

TO TEE EDrErOR-OF THE TTE.
Sir,-I beg to erPresgs mY gratitude for the privrg
affordedmootcalligattention,through your oolumn tcs the awful sate of the Victoria Dock District of P1asietw-~ marsh, and to the humble school.shed in which so mucl, good has been done. I am also most thanlful for th, cor-
roboration afforded in your journal to-day kl my unknown' friend, under the sianature of "B C. L. I oould adc1 much even to the additional facts brought forward by bin,
did I not fear to trespass on your valuable space. Yout powerful article yesterday on the wide separation betweer-. tho rich and the poor, which is becomng, greater evew day, should speak to the heatt of every Engbshman- andI
trust that the cry of the poor residing in Plaistow.marsiwill, through your columns, reach the ears of thosewho ar%. able and willing to help them.
Your correspondent "B. . L." speaks of the unform4e roads and want of sewers, &c. The roads are in truth in many parts, nothing but the soil of the swam marsE trodden up, and in wet weather are scarcely pa ae.Th foul pestiferous ditches, the recipients of all the sewage o£ the neighbourhood, are in some cases at the very doors otf the houses, and have to be crossed on a plank. An Act of Parliament was obtained three or four years ago to drainthe whole of this neighbourhood. This was set aside and n local board of health for the district parishes of West Hani(of which Plaistow is one) established instead. But nothinz nas yet been done. Do, I entreat you, assist me to al
public attention to the question. The lives of hundreds-
re at stake, and something should be set about immediately to abate the dreadful state of Halsville before thehot weather sets in, or I fear sad mortaity wMv ensue. Within a few doors of each other I counted four under-- takers' shops, and from one spot eight publichouses were i'
sight at the saLme time. I am credibly inforned that thek
proprtion of deaths is even aow four or five times greatem Ballsvlile than in more favoured parts of the parish., The missionary scheme to which I invited attention in my first letter was promoted by me with a view to improve the social as well as religious condition of the poor. If their physical condition is so had, what must ho theirmoral state? I reallyfear to mention publicly the degrading anls dreadful facts which have come to my knowvledge.
I have the honouLr to be, Sir,
Your much obliged and faithful servant.

ANOTHER BISHOP.-The public feeling has been
Awommu BIsuoP.-The pubic feeling has been, awakened by reports of the alarming illness ef the Bisho of Glocester and BristoL The BristoZ Gazetc of Thud
is authorized to State that Dr. vatson and Dr. Borroughr,
having been in great anxiety about him on Saturday an' Sunday last, now pronounce the bishop to be out of danger, but in a state of extremo weakness, and nable for thn present to transact any of the duties connected with his success.
A BIsHoP PREACEaNG IX THE OrPE AUiAt the consecration of the cemetery connected with the important town of Keighley the Bishop of Rion, in.
stead of sending the assembled multitude wy fasting tatheir houses, seized the opportunity, and with great earnestness and effect addressed them in the open air. The crows! listened with riveted attention, and with almost the silence
of the dead, whose remains will rest beneath the ground onwrhich they stood. All were astonished at such a sermon,F
from such a peron, in such a place, and quietly went theiu:

?ASSACREOF FRECHE SErrEESiNBwB ALE ioED-A. -The schooner Black Dog arrived at Sydney on the 3d oft February. from lNew Caledonia, bringing intelligence of a shocking massacre of the French colonists by the natives The following account of the massacre is given by the Sy1CiZ Empirc :-" About seven miles from Port de France, I
Berard, a partner in the fDrm of Vial d'Aram, MMire, anI Co., of Sydney, had established a sugar plantation, ataplacsa called Morarn. This establishment was in fail working efficiency, and a large number of persons were employed upoi. it. Many of the natives were received by the unsuspectm planters on the most friendly terms. On the 19th of anua
one of X .Berard's servants was surprised by one of these. natives, and killed on the spot with a tomahawk. Two Nevr Caledonians hastened to M. Berard, and informed him oE' what had happened; that gentleman immediately set out to ascertain the truth of the report, but on his way he was met by a nativeichief, who had been living on the most friendly terms with nim for some time past, dining with him nearly every day, and by this chief he was shot dead. The work of
appe s nowto have spread throughout the plantation, for tho wies of several persons in the service of AL. Berarci were subsequently found, aU of whom had been murdered. The names of the victims are Laurent, Senechal, Queret, Boterel, Jean, Louis, Michel, and Magastre (two brothers) Another brother of the last-named unfortttnate man, bein
on his way from the port to Mora=, escaped. A number of Sandwich Islanders, who were at work on IIL Berard's plantation (more than 12, it is said) were also ruthlessly mtur dered. Much dissatisfaction is expbessed by the friends of the sufferers that a French frigate, with 200 men on board, should have left New Caledonia when the island was iz a state so dangerous to the French residents, leaving the7 colonists unprotected. The discovery was made by a small body of troops (50 men), which had been hastily despatcheil to the spot from head-quarters in consequence of an intimna tion from the French missionaries that some such attack was to be apprehended.. Unhappily they arrived too late. The cause of this atrocity can only be guessed at. It appears clear that there was nothing in the conduct of M. Berardl
and his white companions which could palliate it. Thenatives were treated bv them with preat kindness, and ex. pressed for them the warmest friendship. The crime waconsummated by the natives approaching the settlers im smnaU parties, with their accustomed pretences of friendship; until a largo party had been collected, when the work of murder was commenced in cold blood. It wasnot a fight,' for tho settlers were set upon when, thout arms in theiHhands, they wer engaed in their ordinary avocations. It was a mere butchery, like that of the unfortunate Gazellew' crew by the Woodlark islanders. As the bodies were not eaten (although the natives of Now Caledonia are cannibalsj the act was one of vengeance. In all probability the New Caledonians were displeased with the introduction of nitiveg from Vate or Sandwich Island (one of the New Hebrides). whom they look upon with hostile feelings. It may be, too that the fact of the settlement having been made in this quarter with the permission of the French (local) Govern. mont, instead of under the authority of the native chiefs,' induced the latter to slaughter the settlers. It is oertaia that this act is not the result of any conspiracy among the natives, for only one tribe is concerned in it. A general conspiracy or union of any kind is impossible among the New Caledonians, for their tribes are hostile to each other. The-' bulk of them are friendly towards French rule and settle.. ment, and there is a native force kabout S0) along witlthe 50 soldiers who are on or near the scene of the mas4 Eacre. It will be difficult to follow and punish the murg derers, for the coumtry is mountainous and heavily timbered,~ affording many places for concealment and resistance, anm
the only force at present on the island is about 140 soldiers*! to which may be added between 200 and 300 men belon '
to the frigate stationed there. A large force will do=lre be procured from Tahiti. The Pocklington arrived at. Sydney on the 5th from Port de France, after a quick peasage of six days and a-half. Captain Lewis confirzu the re. ports respecting the attack of the natives on the settlemenrt. of Morarn, and also states that they had possessed them. selves of fiteen months' provisions, which had been xtoresW there, together with aU the arms and a ton and a-half DC gunpowder. Fifty of the military had been despatchei* from Port de France by sea, but on attempting to land w&fired on by the natives, who effectually drsve them of X Captain Lewis believes the disturbanoe has arieen from . refusal of the French settlers to pay the same price for thu land as the English."
