Quotations, however, remain stagnant, and the amount of general businees has been remarkably small. In the earlier part of the morning money was wanted, but there was ultimately a fair supply from bankers and others at about 5q per cent. Consols opened at 94 to i, and again returned to that price after a short period during which there were seUers at .94. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 94 to ; New Three per Cents., 94. to §; Exchequer-bonds, 981 to 99; Indiabonds, 2s. discount to 2s. premium; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium. Foreign securities generaly showed firmness, but the operations were not important. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 951 and i. In Venezuela Deferred transactions took place at 14g. The general business comprised-Buenos Ayres, 85; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44; Russian Fourand-a-Half per Cents. Small, 97i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 88i; Spanish Certificates, 6; Venezuela Deferred, 14-A; Belgian Four-and-a-Ralf per Cents., 98-i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., The final quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening amain failed to arrive, but transactions took place in the Three per Cents. shortly after the opening at 6Tf. 35c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth. Notwithstanding the payment of the dividends there was an active demand for money to-day in the discount-market, at rates slightly below those of the Bank of England. The advances to be reimbursed to that establishment were extremely heavy, and the amounts falling due there during several days to come are believed to be very large. The works lately the property of C. J. Mfare and Co. are about to be carried on, under the Limited Liability Act, by a joint-stock company, to be called the Thames Iron and Ship-building Company. The shares are to be of 5,0001. each, to be paid up in cash within a montb, and the entire amount has been subscribed by 14 persons of good commercial standing in London. The property was purchased of the estate of Mare and Co. by Mr. Peter Rolt. Forgeries in connexion with public securities continue to transpire. A member of the Stock-Exchange has absconded against whom a warrant has been i8sued for forging a power of attorney for the sale of 6501. Consols, and it was ascertained this morning that he has obtained an advance of 2,0001. from a person with whom he had dealigs upon forged certificates of 400 shares of the Peel River Company. They are said, however, to have been so inlperfectly executed that they ought not to have aeceived anyone. The seal of the company was wanting, and the name of the pretended holder was fictitious. They were therefore detected immediately on presentation. The company were previously about to call in all their certificates for the purpose of issuing new ones under the Limited Liability Act, and in consequence of this event they have advertised their intention to take that step immediately. The advices from Mexico, which reach to the 9th of December, contain the following particulars regarding the condition of that country. The insurgents at Puebla, after having held out for several months, had surrendered on the 6th, and this event following almost immediately on the submission of Vidaurri, 'who, with the assistance of American sympathizers, had long headed a formal revolt in the provinces on the Texan frontier, was likely to place President Comonfort in a position of greater strength than he had yet attained. The difficulties with great Britain regarding the claims of Mr. Barron were also understood to have been settled by the Government having accorded the fuU satisfaction demanded. The oountry, however, was still disturbed by varlous small pasties of rebels wandering iu different districts, some of them at no great distance from the capital; and there was anxiety also as to the course likely to be pursued by General Alvarez, who had again taken the field nominally to support the Government, but who is alleged to have allowed himself to become the instrument of the extreme democratic party,with whom Comonfort has lost his popularity. Alvarez was the chief actor in the overthrowvof Santa Anna, and was then nominated Dictator or President, but, being little gifted with administrative skill, he subsequently waived his pretensions in favour of Comonfort. " Whatever," it is said, " may be the real intentions of the crafty old General, certain it is that he has moved on towards Mexico with a body of troops stated to be 3,000 strong." With regard to Vidaurri, who is universally suspected of entertaining a secret understanding with the Americans, the report was that his return to obedience had been obtained at a cost of $1 00,000, and the promise of military promotion. Although the Barron claim had been settled it was known that many other demands of British creditors remained to be redressed, and surprise was consequently expressed that the British squadron, which had lately been often announced, had not made its appearance. " The bondholders," it is remarked, " know full well by sad experience how loth all Mexican Administrations are to pay their debts, and how much they are apt to presume on the prodigious good nature shown in that respect by Her Majesty's Government." One satisfactory result of the temporary lull of internal discord and of the communication with Vera Cruz, which was interrupted by the struggle at Puebla, being restored would be the sending forward of the large amounts of silver hitherto delayed. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada are making arrangements to establish a system of through tickets, by which passengers from Europe may secure their route to any part of Canada or the United States without the necessity of making any subsequent payment or inquiry. The necessary agreements with all the leading railways of the United States have already been completed, and the plan is likely to effect the important service of putting a stop to the base impositions by which emigrants and other travellers to America have hitherto been defrauded. The subjoined communication affords another illustration, in addition to those already given, of the state of the law as it affects the ruined shareholders of the Royal British Bank. The great evil the commercial community have to apprehend from the experience lately gained in this case is that in every similar instance for the future the dread of law will be such as to induce all parties to combine to achieve a private arrangement at any sacrifice, and tbat thus offending directors and managers will be wholly released from the dread of exposure or punishment. Previously to the suspension of the Royal British Bank a feeling of this kind had been rapidly growing, so as in many instances of failure to cause details to be suppressed which if brought before a public court would have operated as useful warnings to the commercial community:- " Sir,-The interests of the creditors of this bank have been so ably advocated in your columns that I trust yoa will not hesitate to afford a space for a statement of the ption of the unfortunate and morally guiltless shareholders. The aid of the Court of Eqcuity was sought by the shAreholders for the purpose of sournng rateable contribations to make up the deficiency, while, at the same time, the existing assets could be realize d distributed among the creditors. Nfo other Cout possesses both powers. Nevertheless, at the Instarnce-of one creditor, the C:ourt of Bankrruptcy interferes, and trAkes possesion of all the proper funDds-viz., tbe assest of the corporate_body-with v^huch tne corporate debts ought to be paid. Witlh this proceeding one might be satisfied if the ahareholders were only required to make up the difference necessary for the payment of every creditor in full. But, with the desire- to pay as far as possible, the shareholders are being ruined irretriev. ably, or, notwithstandiar the assets might be sufficient to pa? all the liabilities, an notwithstandimg they are now held by the assignees in trust for the creditors, yet every creditor can still bring his action against the official manager, and wvhen judgment hias been obtained, which mray be done in eight days, separate summonses may be served upon each and every shareholder at one and the same time, coall. Ing upon him to show cause why execution should not be issued against him, The shareholders are about 300 in num. ber, so there may be that number of summonsesissuedin respecs of each debt, and already in some cases have they been htbographed with this very object It is sid tbat there are 6,000 creditors, andit follows, therefore,that if every creditor exercised his right no less, than 1,800,000 summonses might be served. Assume the costs of each shareholder in respect of each summnous to amount to no more than 40a., no smaler sum than 3,600,0001. would be required to pay these costs, in addition to the costs of the actions-about seven times the amousit of the debts. Can attorneys; see this and not feel grateful to the Legislature? " lt was stated that bankruptcy would prevent these evils by the appointment of a receiver, bifi by the judgment of the Lord Chancelor it a-pea that no ieceiver can be appointed. If the lavr will not afford this protection, of what practical use is the bankruptcy ? None. to the creditorstons to the shareholders. "Yours obediently, B.

STATE OX TRADE. NOTTINGEHAM, JAN-. 8. The lace trade still remains quiet, but we may expect operations very soon to commence. We have some orders for the Canadian and also the German market, and now that stock-taking is nearly over and the new year commenced a busy season may b expected. In hosiery there is not much doing. The demrand for the home market i8 very limited, and for foreiga consumption the trade 18 now inactive. However, our prospects are good, and manufacturers are *nticipating a reaction speedily. In reviewing the lace trade of the pastyear a local contemporary states:- " In looking atthe present state and future prospects of this branch of industry, which is very natural at the commencement of a new year, we may say that there Is much to encourage. One portion, and that the original from which others have sprung-we mean the plain net - was, 18 months ago, a very unremunerative production, and fe3rs were entertained that it would gradually die out, bat now the demand is larser than ha been known for many years, prices have advanced, and consumption appers likely to incresae. Tbis arises from itbeing USed for purposes Which it wae not at one time thought at all adapted for, such as foundations for bonnets ano lnings of various kinds, it being much lighter and quite as stiff as the fabrics formerly in use As respects the fancy branches a large amount of business has been, and must eontinuoto be done. The perfection to which the machinery used is now brought enables such close imitatiotn of hand-madegoods to be produced that It has greatly enlarged the demand, and renders silklace andedgingscspecially articlesof neoessity for ornamenting both bonnets and dresses. The importance the lace trade now assumes ranks it among one of the staple production, of this great manufacturingination. Wearenotatpresentinpossesionofstatisticstoshow our readers how rapid has been its growth, but all who know anything of the great increase during tho last few years in the population of Nottingham will see that some cause must have been at work to render so many more dwellings necessary for the accomamodation of ustih a rapidly increasing population, aud we do not think that any other can be assigned than the great impulse given by the increase and prosperity tof the lace ade.b We hope that all Iusee who are engaed in itwillendeavour to use their enersiea for the purpose of further imiproving thin beautiful fabric, for it is not by making cheap rubbish that the character and standing of the trade' are to be secured, but by producing novelties and aiming at higfher perfections than have yet been attained. dvehavou oue every @eexmertcion Suo protduce and sell as good and perfect ;antaurticle as all the ingenuity wre ran exerci e may enable us to mann- Respecting the hosiery trade the same authority observes:- " As we are entecing upon a new year, it may not be out of place to say a few words on the one just cloeed, as well as regarding fottre proepects. The termination of the war, and the transition to a state of peace with all the altered circmmstances usually attending such extraordinary alterations, added to the disturbauce existing in the money-market, might well have been expected to produce disastrous resuts upon the manufacturing interests. That tbese have to some oxtent been adversely affected by those events is not to be denied, but we can reall congratulate or readers that dpon the whole the past year has been one of steady and remuneratUve business The pro"-ect dor the imnede a oture is bebright and encouragoi, and there uitUe reason to Doubt that a healthy and profiable trade will be done r nd bat reguar employment aTe fair prices wili rendily be obtainable by industrious artisans in the vadros branches of the hosiery trade." I,EICESTB R, JAN. 8. The wintry weather we have had duri'ng the at fear days is in favour of a better demasnd for hostery, and there is every rea on to antcpate a revival. Trade here is very much expanding. The fancy department is becoinge quite a conspicuous feature, and w rear iglad to say thatour manufacturers embace every opportunity of improving theirmachinery. Woos gare exceedingly dear, and there does not appear any prospect of a reduction. BRADFORD, JA^N. 8. There is a good attendance of mer hants at our market to-day, and a better business is doing in p ieee-goods. Stocks in the hands of merhants are smal, and orders are therefore given out to the manufacturers pretty freely. We have had a fair trade in the warehouses during the week, taking into consideration the period of the year. At late full quotationsthere iS a moderate amount transacting in combing wools, generally for immediate use. Noils and short wools remain without change, there being a steady demand at full prices. In the yarn trade. higher figures are demanded on the acceptance of new contracts; as a general rule, the spinners are employed in working out old orders, the high prices of the raw mnaterial effectually placing a cheek upon speculative business, In cotton warps there is not much animation, but prices are firm. The operatives in Bradford and throug out the worsted distict are fairly employed. The borough statistics of pauperism for the past-week showv the large decrease of 1,028 in the numboer of persons in the receipt of relief, as compared with the correspondig period of last year.

ZONDAON, FBIDAY, JANUARY 9, 1857. Till within a very few years no product of England appeared so impoesible to transport across the xeas ax her responiible government. The great Republic which has sprang from our American colonies hax developed our love of liberty, our respect for individual fights, and our deference to public opinion, but has never been able to appropriate to herself the EInglish executive. In every State, aa wel as in the Central Legislature, the chief magistrate is elected for a definite period, and the Ministers of the Federal Government are excluded from seats in the Legislature, and may retain office, although they and their opinions are in a decided minority. The notion of a responsible Government holding office so long as it retained the confidence of the Legislative Assembly has for the first time in the present year been brought into practice in the Australian colonies. Educated hithlerto under a system of political tutelage, with one-third of their members nominated by the CRowN, and consisting partly of officials w hom no possible success of opposition could displace, the Australian Assemblies had but little experience of the theory or practice of constitutional government. How matters are to proceed in Victoria we do not know, for the elections are not yet concluded ; but we have had a notable specimen of the turbulent infancy of responsible government in New South Wales. The spring of last year was occupied in that colony by an election of members to serve in the Lower House. The electoral districts in the colony were said at the time of passing the act under which it received its constitution to have been framed with great inequality, and from this cause, or from some other of which our accounts do not inform us, parties appear to have been nearly equally balanced. The Governor, Sir WILLIAm DENIsoi-whose conduct throughout the whole of these complicated transactions appears, so far as we have the means of judging, to have been extremely judicious and impartial-first devolved the task of forming a Government on Mr. THomsoN, the Colonial Secretary under the old rggime. On the failure of this gentleman the duty was intrusted to Mr. DONALDsoN, a merchant and settler, who succeeded, though vvith great difficulty, in forming a Ministry. This Government seems to have been formed of Conservative elements, and to have been suspected at least of an intention to maintain the claims of the present occupants of Crown lands in all their integrity. However, the Government obtained a majority, but a majority so small that in August last they resigned because they did not receive that amount of support to which they believed themselves entitled. Sir WILLIAx DENIsoN then summoned to his Councils Mr. Cow?rE, the leader of the Opposition, who formed a Government, but was driven to select his Attorney-General from among the solicitors instead of the bar, there being, as it appears, the same line of demarcation between the two branches of the profession there as in England. The bar, of course, were indignant at such a slight, and personal objections seem to have existed against the new Attorney-General of more force than his belonging to the wrong branch of the legal hierarchy. When this Ministry met the House a vote of censure was moved upon them, mainly levelled at this obnoxious Attorney-General, and carried by a majority of two. Mr. CowPis and his colleagues thereupon resigned, and the scale, which had inclined for the moment in favour of the Liberals, once more favoured the Conservatives. By the last accounts a new Ministry was formed by Mr. PARKER, a gentleman whose fame, whatever it may be, has not yet penetrated these northern regions. We have been thus particular in narrating these events because, as it is of great importance to truth that the difficulties of responsible government should not be extenuated, so it is of equal consequence to the future well government of our colonies that they should not be exaggerated or misrepresented. It is very easy to raise out of these frequent, almost theatrical, changes of Ministers and Ministries a cry that the colonies are unfit for self-government. For our own part, we see nothing in what has happened in New South Wales which might not perfectly well have happened in England itself, always excepting the sensitiveness of a Prime Minister who resigns office while he has got a working majority of two, and the nomination of an Attorney-General selected from the roll of solicitors. It is nothing new in this country for parties to be nearly balanced or Ministries to be shortlived. Nor is the conflict, as has been represented, one merely for place and power. There is a vast prize at stake-no less than the unsold lands of the colony, which the one party wish to retain in the hands of the present occupants at nominal rents, and the other to throw open to purchase. The minority claim to represent the larger portion of the people of the colony, and only to be outvoted by an unfair division of the electoral districts. The struggle must continue till victory decides for one side or the other; and, instead of cavilling at its course, we ought to rejoice that we have provided our colonists with an arena on which to fight out their local differences by argument and reason, instead of having recourse to those explosions of fury and discord which are apt to agitate those conununities for whose passions a similar safetyvalve is not provided. Responsible government can do great things, but it cannot beforehand ascertain the relative force of parties, nor discern without trial the fittest men to conduct the government, nor remedy by its own innate force the faulty distribution of electoral power; but there is no reason to doubt that in Australia, as elsewhere, the effect of responsible government, when time has been given it to attain its full development, will prove the same blessing that it has been in England and in Canada. We must beware of copying the impatience of many vwell-meaning persons in 1S48, wlho, because their newv institutions did not at once regenerate nations utterly unaccustomed to think and act for themselves, and restore a prosperity undermined by centuries of misgovernment, believed their aspirations after liberty a dream, and sank back into their old lethargy. A remembrance of the struggles and blunders, the crimes and absurdities, through which England foundered into her present constitution should lead us to look with tolerance and with hope on our rising colonies, and teach us not to be surprised above measure if they do not realize fully in six months a work which cost us as many centuries.
It is some comfort in the greatest disaster and adificulty that the time will come when we shall know all about it. Some day or other, sitting at our firesides, if we only live long enough, we shaull have all the particulars, the figures, and perhaps a map and a picture of the catastrophe. We shall then see exactly how it stands compared with other catastrophes, how it might have been avoided, or might have been worse. Instead of having to deal with the " men of the situation," who are iot always as reasonable, considerate, or ptrictly inpartial as they might be, we shall be in the. easier company of historians and statisticians, who see the affair through the same placid medium as one naturally regards the progrens of a public building, the reports of a charitable eociety, or the returns of the Board of Trade. Should your neighbourhood be kept in terror for a whole winter by the knowledge that a desperate ruffian who was unaccountably not hung two years ago is at large -shlould your elderly friend be garotted, robbed, and half-killed on his way to your dinner-tableabould your own castle be forced at midnight, and your faithful servant made a cripple for life in his attempt to rescue your plate, or some humbler neighbour be the victim of some still worse outrage, do not distress yourself. You will know at the end of the year, or the third year at the latest, exactly how many scoundrels have been let loose, after what terms of confinement, and what they had for dinner every day of it; how many people have been garotted, murdered, or robbed; and what are your exact chances of being sotreated bytheseveral classes of ticket-of-leave men, discharged convicts, convicted criminals, suspected ditto, and persons of hitherto unsullied reputation. You may also amuse yourself with a comparison of the sexes, the ages, the professions, the literary attainments, and the theological proficiency of the several delinquents. NLo doubt these are interesting inquiries, and for rminds of a speculative turn, or with an appetite for facts, they may be an agreeable compensation for the loss of silver spoons and forks, waU fruit, pheasants, or even a broken arm, a broken skull, or a permanent injury to the organs of respiration. The wisdom, and even the necessity, of " knowing aU " about it" we do not dispute for a moment, though it may require a peculiar turn of mind to appreciate the results. There was once, however, a certain statesman, and he no ordinary one, who had the temerity to avow that there were two things he never believed. The one was " facts," and the other was "figures." Whatever the particular meaning of his incredulity, we must say that we share it in a sense of our own. We do not think that the world is governed by " facts" and " figures." The statistics of France were never in better order than when Louis PniIrrP found himself one morning reduced to the rank of Mr. WILM1I SuiITn. We should not be surprised to learn, could, it be ascertained, that the criminal returns of the city of Rome were decidedly in favour of monarchical institutions at the very moment when the whole family of TARQuI9S had to beat a retreat. Our own position compels us sometimes to set weight against figures. We know very well that certain events that figure only as units in the scale of the statist will outweigh whole sheets of figures. We know, moreover, that they ought to do so, such is their moral effect on all the classes concerned. Colonel JEBB is a first-rate statist. He has the right figures, and he reasons admirably upon them. His letter in oxur paper of yesterday is a model for any country the population of which is entirely under the dominion of reason, the climate of which secures it from nervous complaints, and where even the robbers and murderers-if there are anytake in blue-books, and amuse themselves with decimal sums in criminal arithmetic. The Colonel, however, makes some admissions not at all of a nature to reassure the old ladies, or even the old gentlemen, who now lie listening for. " noises" tiU 2 o'clock in the mornin,g. His first admission is, that under the existing acts there can be no possible alteration of the practice. He leaves us no loophole. It is all according to law. No doubt, he intimates, judges and magistrates are very undiscriminating, and sometimes pass verylight sentences on atrocious offenders. The law, however, cannot undertake the office of the judge. It can only deal with the sentence; and if the same sentence has been passed on the wretched pilferer of a few pounds of bacon and the deliberate perpetrator of the most horrible outrages, the law, says Colonel JmBB, interferes at the same period, and restores them both to society. So far, however, from the practice being an innovation on the side of lenity, it is much more severe than the previous one; at least, by the testimony of the criminals themselves, who, the Colonel informs us, would much rather be sent to Australia at the end of four years' imprisonment in this country than set at large in their own dear country after two years and a-half. The chaplain, he says, has nothing to do with it. The only condition required by the act is a certain amount of good behaviour. In the department of criminal science it appears that the moral scale is graduated with an accuracy which removes all doubt between the convict and his keepers. The former sees the scale, and knows how to act up to its requirements. The Home-office, the visiting magistrates,andall the authorities concerned see atonce when the requisite degree of morality has been attained. So, shutting their eyes to " antecedents," to the peculiar circunistances underwhich their hopeful proMg6 came under their care, and despising the vulgar belief. that a man who has done certain things is sure to do them again, they give him his liberty, leaving society to take care of itself. It's all quite regular, says the Colonel, and he pronounces it good. So, of couree, we are not surprised at the further aggravation of the present state of things that, in the Colonels opinion, there can be no immediate improvement upon it. Very well; as, according to the Colonel, there is not sufficient discrimination, or rather none at all, except between what nurserymaids caU the " behaviour" of this convict or that, neither of them having a very wide scope within the four walls of a gaol ; as the chaplain has not even the opportunity of discriminating; as the sentences are very undiscriminatory ; as the Home-office does not venture to discriminate; and as the system is simply a machine by which convicts of all sorts and sizes come in at one end and re-appear at the other in the uniform shape of ticket-of-leave people, we cannot be very wide of the mark if we suggest that some further attempt be made towards a better discrimination, and consequent classification. If we are to deal with all convicts in the same way, then we can understand the present system may meet a great variety of cases as well as any one other. With more discrimination, however, we may attempt different methods of treatment. There clearly are those of whose reform we may entertain some reasonable hope, and as clearly there are others who are either irreclaimable or too dangerous to be set at large. We don't see why the personal question-for it is a personal questionmay not be decided while the man is- in prison, and upon various considerations. For example, we must say, in the present state of society, considering the mutual confidence in which we all dwell, anid the way in which we leave ourselves at the mercy of violence, we have a very great reluctance to see men convicted of gross personal outrages thrown again on the public, except after the utmost posaible ordeal. But, assuming certain less desperate or less formidable classes, surely we have not yet exhausted the desert shores, the outlying and inhospitable regions of the earth, where these meni might spend the rest of their lives in such labours and under such a system as the site and the comnunity would allow t It need not be a paradise; as little need it be a hell; but to a moderate purgatory we have no objection. The chief point, of course, would be that there should be no escape, and an impassable gulf between it and the more attractive colonies. Nature itself has adapted New Holland for the purpose, and left two of its shores as remote and inaccessible as could be required for such an object. For more desperate offenders, for those whose tendencies are positively fornidable, and whose amendment it is folly to hope for, there remains the last resource of perpetual and hopeless imprisonment at home. Such persons, seeing that humanity does not permit penal hunger and maceration, may as well be employed on public works, such as those of Portland. The Colonel himself oberaves that there is plenty of this sort of work to be done, and rather a want of convict labour for the purpose. Indeed, this is about the only suggestion of practical value in his letter, and as stoon ua Parliament meets we tust that eTuy ticket-of-leave man caught at his old tricks may Ireap the benefit of it.
Under an ominous, but of late not uncommon heading, our columne have lately contained statements well calculated to arrest and occupy the attention of the reader. Seldom indeed have frauds been described showing greater ingenuity or more elaborate procedure in the execution of crime. We must premise that at present the proceedings only take the form of a charge against certain persons in custody, named JAMES .AxDERso2v and JAcsxs TowNsaND SAWARD. These prisoners are stil under remand, having not as yet been even committed for trial; while it should be further added that the two principal witnesses examined are not only convicts under sentence of transportation for life, but men against whom previous convictions are also on record. In the present instance they give evidence as having been accomplices in the acts alleged, and it is from their testimony that we now, without any intention of prejudging the case at issue, compile a short accomunt for the benefit of the public. According to the allegations thus advanced, the prisoners A-DmtsoX and SAWARD, together with the convicts AxrwiLL and HARDWICK, now professing to make a clean breast of it, were confederates in machinations of the most extraordinary and extensive kind for obtaining money by forgeries upon the various banks of this city. In the mere crime of forgery itself there is nothing, unhappily, very novel; it is from the deliberation of purpose evinced, from the depth of the plans devised, and the complication of the machinery set in motion, that the present examples derive their unprecedented interest. To what extent the proceedings may have been carried is more than we can yet tell, but Mr. ML%LENs, the solicitor to the Bankers' Committee, observed on Saturday last that up to that time he had at least 30 witnesses to examine for the prosecution. If we are to credit the evidence hitherto adduced, the firt step in these advancesthe first approach opened against the strong box of the banker, was to obtain possession of bond fide checks, either - paid or payable, drawn by some individual or firm upon the bank intrusted with their funds. These documents testify to the mutual dealings of the paties concemned, and furnished the original handwriting and signature from wnich the copy could be taken. As the prisoner SAWARD seems to have been familiarly known as " Jim the Penman," we presume we may assign him this department in the division of labour. There ras then a man called the " sender," whose office it was to despatch the checks so prepared to the banks for cash, at which stage of the operations, be it observed, the practice was to engage some individual entirely unconcerned in the fraud. "The usual plan," said the witness IIAIDuWICK, " was to get some " innocent person to present the forged document." The innocent person in question, however, was not unattended. Under pretence of making some commonplace inquiry at the establishment, one of the real accomplices followed him quietly into the bank, and took stealthy notice of the reception he experienced. If all went smooth, and the check was cashed, he left the bank and signalled the result to a confederate ontside, so that the " sender" was duly forthcoming at the rendezvous to receive the money. If the messenger was detained, or inquiries instituted, or suspicion in any way manifested, this result also was promptly telegraphed, in which case, as we need not add, the originators of the errand were looked for in vain. Such was the general theory of the proceedings, as alleged by the witnesses, but it is in the details of the practice that the most striking features are to be found. To begin with, how are checks to be procuredeither blank, filled up, or cancelled.-for it is not, or at any rate never should be, the habit of prudent people to leave such documents about? From certain statements in the evidence we are disposed to surmise that the foundation of forgeries was sometimes laid in burglaries, and that such seemingly useless things as old checks formed part of the spoil carried off by robbers, to be turned in this vway to account. Twice did the witness ATTWELL give this explanation of the way in which the necessary documents had been procured. But, as this resource occasionally failed, a more deliberate and systematic operation was resorted to. We take the instance of a solicitor in Red Lionsquare, upon whose account at GosLLNO's it was thought desirable to make an attempt. ArrwELL repaired to this gentleman with a story that a person named HESP (imagined for the occasion) owed him money, for which he wished application by a lawyer to be made, a place having meanwhile been hired at which the supposed Mr. Hrsr might be presumed to reside, and where the lawyer's letter would be taken in. These steps having been taken, and the imaginary Mr. H-EsP having been duly threatened with the rigours of the law, ATTWvLL advances from his own pocket the money to pay his own demand, and sends it by his own brother to the solicitor's office. But here came the unlucky hitch in the transaction. All these proceedings had been based on the presumption that if the money were judiciously left for a few days in the attorney's hands, so that it would probably go with his ordinary receipts into his bank, he must needs, when he came to settle with his client, write a check for the amount, and thus furnish his obliging customer with the document and pattern required. As it happened, however, payment was made in cash, so that all the expense as well as the labour was lost, but the operation was repeated afterwards, and with more success. On another occasion ATTWELL and HARDWICK betook themselves into the Eastern Counties, and there also eng,aged profemsional agency for the same purposes, but their career in those parts was abruptly cut short by arrest an-d conviction. The reader will not fail to iobaerve the employment of capital as well as labour in these transactios3. Upwards of 1001., money in hand, was sometimes forthcoming to pay the imaginary debt with, and 2501. was paid in to a bauker's by way of furnishing HARDWICK with credit and introduction at Yarmouth. It is not to be supposed that all the work was over when a forged check had been manufactured after the orignal, and prepared for presentation. The place of rendezvous had to be altered repeatedly, and the " sender," -a capacity apparently filled by AhnRnsoX, disguised himself with false hair or .whiskers and "changed his name each time that " a check was sent." Some inductive reasoning too must have been required to decide upon the amount which any particular operation might carry. On one occasion ATTwxar asserts that SAWARD, after obtaining some blank and paid checks belonging to a certain person, proceeded to make a deliberate reconnaissance of the premises, and concluded that " it was not a very large firm, " and that he did not expect to get much from it." The crisis of the action occurred, of course, in the banking-house, upon the presentation of the cheek. As the agent at this point was commonly quite innocent, he would apply for the cash without confusion or misgiving, but the suspense of the accomplice on the watch must have been now and then pkinfuil. Once the sentinel on this duty, after seeing the check actuaUy paid, oberved "several of the clerks got. toge"ther," and "comparing the signature to this "check with some others." Another time the Blip between. ts ep and the lip was remarkabjS- the more so, indeed, as the ventunoe was for no less than 1,0001. 'The clerk had actually paid the money into the very hands of the messenger, when m igiviugs occurred, and it was taken back again. The progress of the pending inquiries will, no doubt, admit us further into the mysteries of transactions which for elaborateness of scheming aeem unsurpassed by anything previously on record. What will most probably suggest itself just now to the reader's mind is a refection on the industry, as well as ingenuity, thus expended upon crime. Had the like pains been applied in any honest pursuit they must have yielded an honest livelihood. The operations detailed, if the evidence should ultimately be substantiated, are not the actions of idlers or vagabonds betaking themselves to thievery as something preferable to work. They evince skill, patience, and even a species of enterprise, which, if employed ,in a lawful direction, would have produced their due reward; but we trust that the exposure of the case may end in the rain of at least this one department of crime, and render the paths of fraud by so much the less inviting.
The administration of justice with regard to persons wrongfnlly convicted requires alteration. Despite of all the precautions we can take mistakes will sometimes occur, and an innocent man receives an ignominious sentence. At present the praefice is to grant the Qumes pardon, as it is called, to a man who by the mere fact of his release is acknowledged to be entirely guiltless of the offence for which he had been condemned. The term is in itself an offence-what need has an innocent man of pardon.' We should not, however, quarrel about words if, substantially, any proper compensation were granted to the individual who had been so cruelly handled in person and in character. He should be invited to attend at the court where he had received his sentence, and his innocence should be as emphatically proclaimed by the presiding judge as his supposed guilt had been on a formaer ccasion. More than this, inquiry ought to be made as to the extent to which he had been damnifled by the error of the law. How long had he been detained in gaol t How had his circumstances been affected by his conviction ? What had become of his wife and children-if he had anyduring the period of his incarceration? Compensation full and ample should be granted to him under all these heads; it is impossible to imagine a stronger case for redress. The law grants damages to one man as against another for false imprisonment, but how 'when the law itself has been at fault? The law will compel one individual to compensate another for the injuries he may have sutained by malicious prosecution; but here the prosecution has been a mistake from first to last. We compel railway companies to give ample compensation to any one who may have been bruised or injured in their carriages, by collision or otherwise. If a householder leaves any portion of his premises unguarded while he is making repairs, so that any casual passer-by receives an injury through the mere neglect of the householder, it is a case for damages. But to tear a man away from his home and fanily, to drive him about the streets in a prison van from the policeoffice to the gaol, to place him in the dock at the Old Bailey, to pronounce upon him a sentence which consigns him to infamy, to remit him to the prison and to the hulks that he may undergo all the pains and penalties which are attributed by the justice of the country to the status of a convicted criminal, while his wife and children are starving out of doors,-this long series of outrages upon innocence, we say, goes for nothing. The unfortunate who has been subjected to them is deemed a fitting subject for the QUEENi'S pardont ! This is no imaginary case. The Rev. JoiLc DAVIS, the Ordinary of Newgate, has just furnished us with particulars of the sad history of a certain JoHN. MAxxitA3r, who, when walking in Oxfordstreet, was mistaken for JsmEs A?xDnrsox, the man who is now under examination at the Mansionhouse upon the charge of having defrauded the city banks. lARKxA.-r and ATrw-EL's brother were tried together for forgery. MuaRrA3 was convicted, and sentenced to four years of penal servitude, while his companion was acquitted. It was a case of mistaken identity-the lawyers and police bad got hold of the wrong man. The poor creature was obliged to sell every little article of furniture he possessed in the world to provide for his unsuccessful defence. His wife was reduced to the deepest distress, and the man himself suffered actual imprisonment for six months. When the matter came to be looked into the detectives found that they really had made a mistake, and that JoBn MARXHsm was not JAmES AiDERSON. The result we give in Mr. DAvis's own 'ords:- " By the exertions of the late Under-Sheriff Rose, whom I gladly assisted, such evidence was placed hefore the Secretary of State that, after ita careful examination by the detective police, the unhappy John MLark-ham was, with MSr. Mullen'sJ consent, on the part of the bankers of London, pardoncd by Sir George Grey, and liberated." Mrr. DAVIS concludes by recommending the case to the favourable consideration of the Asociation of Bankers, and, no doubt, in the present unsatisfactory state of the law upon this point, it is to them only that JOHN lARKHAM, can look for redress. The agents in his prosecution, unwittingly, no doubt, have done this poor man a grievous wrong. If they act properly by him now, it cannot be reckoned to their discredit that they made a mistak-e when a police magistrate, the detective police, a judge and jury were also deceived. They did, however, make a mistake, and a very fatal one to the poor man principally concerned. They are bound to do something for the victim of their error beyond the paltry farce of joining in an application for his pardon. It is, however, to be regretted that the compensation of an individual who has been so grievously wronged should be left to the fortuitous benevolence or commiseration of the persons who conducted his prosecution. It is to society at large, acting through its accredited agents, that the victim of so dreadful an error has a right to look for redress. It should be considered that this machinery of our laws and our law courts has been provided for the security of all. Occasionally injustice will be done, notwithstanding every precaution that can be used. Society, then, is bound to grant rodress, not pardon, to the individual who has been sacrificed to the workings of a system which gives in the main security of life and property to all. If there be question of pardon at all, it should be given by the sufferer to those who have done him such foul wrong; to talk of knocking an innocent man down, and then giving him your forgiveness, is si-ply a wked absurditv.

INOTS OF A TOUB FRBOr MOSOO.VTO THE CRIMEA. (BY oUR SPZEcAL OOXRpoymvtjr Butter is rarely met with in Russia, and when it isto be had itiugenera'ly bad Afterbreakfat_it Was an earlyone, for many arrivals took place during the morning soon after daybreak, and the fire of papirot became very strong and the noise very great, ancd the company generally 8eemed inclined to sit dowrn on us as wre lay in our humble beds, a l& Procrwste-we had a small investigation of the town, and assisted at an important ceremony in the street which attracted mueh attention,-I mean the mending of our tarantasse, at which two men were busily employed under the orders of our two couriers, to which they paid not the slightest attention. The Tulers, or Tulites, came out in great force on this occasion, and venerable graybeards and rough mujik-s volunteered an immense deal of advice, and entered on long disqiiisitions evincing considerable acquaintance with the general principles of the constitution of a tarantasse. As another of the traits of good feeling and kindliness which one frequently eeriences in Russia, without much affectation o} friendship or of polito professions on the part of those who possess them, I may mention that a Russian officer of rank who was passing by accident, and saw the crowd round the tarautasse, and that the proprietors were evidently strangers, sent down an old soldier to keep guard over the vehicle, and to prevent the natives from being troublesome, and the thanks for this unsought courtesy which we then could not pay our good friend I now beg to tender to him. Russia has learnt by the hardest of all testg the inefficiency of the arms served out to her prodigious mases of infantry, and she will a soon as the means permit make exertions to plac her army on an equal footing with that of the most civilized European Powers. That is a task which Tula cannot accomplish in its present condition. From all I could hear it was pretty evident that the establishments for the manufacture of arms had utterly failed to ma ke up for the losses of muskets and side arms at Alma, Inkermaun, and in the flight from those fatal fields. In times of peace it was calculated that the factories could produce from 85,000 to 90,000 stand of arms and about 30,000 bayonets and appurtenances for side arms in the year; but during the war, when the wants of the army became pressing, it was found impossible, as I am informed, to get more than 120,000 muskets and about 40,000 bayonets from Tula, although the workmen were "pressed" from every side, and the machinery was never idle night or day. The new muskets which have been lately turned out are very superior to those with which we found the Russian soldier armed at the Alma, and the Crown peasants who form the new riflemen of the Guard Corps are provided with very excellent rifles, which seem to have been imitated from our first Minie. Great expectations were formed of the services which would be rendered to the besieged Dy these redoubtable sharpshooters, in whose rankis, say the Russians, are the finest shots in the world-the gamekeepersof the Crownforests, accustomed to the pursuit of wild animals, the sable-hunters of Siberia, and the huntsmen who pay their tribute in the furs of the finer coated animals of Northern and North-Eastern Russia-. Much enthusiasm was displayed on their departure for the south, and many prayings and blessings took place as they marched forth on their long tramp to the Crimea; but they never arrived there, and peace was proclaimed ere they got to Perekop. I think our Rifles and the French Chasseurs would have been quite a match for the pick of these much-vaunted tirailleurs. Of the militia called out in such numbers after the death of Nicholas many battalions would have gladdened the hearts of our good old English generals, for they were armed with " Brown Bess", and in such perfection, too-real, sound, constitutional flint muskets, pattern of the reign of George IL, or thereabouts. The Guard Corps was weU armed,and so was part of the Grena. dier Corps, but many of the line regiments had old flint muskets, with narrow stocks converted into detonators, and some of the locks had no "halfcock." The latter imperfection might have been the result of accident. I could not ascertain how many workmen there were employed in Tula, but one of my informants said they amounted to nearly 10,000 during the war, and that they were then about 8,000. Many arms, however, are made in Siberia at two Government establishments, the names of which are quite undecipherable as they stand in my notes. There are nearly 1,000 smiths, forgers, and hammerers, and a corresponding number of stockmakers, lockmakers, and other artificers, who are divided into separate guilds or corporations according to their trades. Two large foundries and many mills worked by water macuhinery, there being an excelent and constant fall from the streares of the lupa, which runs through the town, are constantly at work. Iron is found in the neighbourhood, and the forges of Demidoff and other works are supplied by these mines. It is said that coal is abundant, but the fuel used in the furnaces is wood and charcoaL In the Govermnent works Siberian iron is exclusively employed, and the cavalry swords are manufactured of the same material. Mr. Jones, who was engaged in 1817 to examine the resources of the district around. Tula, found iron ore and coal in abundance; but the latter has, I believe, never been worked, because the Russians do not understand how to employ it, and the Tula iron does not bear the highest reputation. The magazine contained poor specimens of it in a manufactured state, candlesticks, knives and forks, catlery, cast and wrought iron articles, and very bad guns and pistols, at ridiculously high prices. The trade is highly protected, and a friend of mine who wished to carry his own gun in Russia -ono which had been well used, by the bye-was obliged to pay 6i. duty on it at the St. Petersburg Custom-house. A Russian sportsman never thinks of using a Tula-made gun if he can afford one of French or English manufacture, and his sporting apparatus is generally marked with some name wellknown in our coverts. There are many other trades and manufactures carried on here in addition to those connected with the Government small anr manufactory. Beetroot sugar, sap, candles', and tin-ware are made in considerable quantities; wax and tallow are melted and refined, and there xre two great fairs in the year for the 'ale and exchango of produce. About 2,50C,900)b. of tallow are, it is said, rendered annually at the Tula manufactorieL With all this trade th. city looks poor on account of the huge zub=,aef Wsall and dingy houses, and it will look stial worse, probably, as the houses get a little oj br, fer many of them date from 1834, when a grO*4bxjlagration occurred which inflicted an enorz n lo e on the town.

IR4LAND. (FrOM OUR OWN COORR1SFOlDNT.) DUBLIN, THURSDAY MORzNUG. THE INCOME-TAX. The movement against the *var ninepence is now fairly in operation at this side of the Channel. The most important of the provincial demonstrations came off yesterday in the city of Cork, upon which occasion a large and inflnential body of citizens met in the Court-house for the purpose of protesting against the continuance of the tax in its present shape. The Mayor presided; and the first resolution, of which the following is a copy, was proposed in a lengthened speech by Ir. W. Fad-an, one of t.he city members: "That, though the Irish nation had scarcely recovered in 185.3 from previous years of famine and from accumulated local txation when the income-tax was extended to Ireand, yet it has not only acquiesced in its imposition, but it has IllOSt readily submitted to this inquisitorial and inte(lltable tax being more than doubled during the prosecution of a just and necessary war, on the final result of which wvere staked the hononr of the empire aud the liberties of Western Europe." Mr. Edmund Burke seconded the resolution. The second resolution was proposed by Colonel Beamish, and seconded by Mr. J. F. Maguire, M.P. :- "' That the act of 1854, which raised the tax to Us. 2d. in the pound during the war, enacted that 12 months after the 5th of April succeeding its actual termination the increase should cease and determine, while the act of 1855, which added 2d. more in the pound to the tax, enacted that the whole increase should cease 12 months after the 5th of April succeeding the ratification of the treaty of peace; that the war was terminated by the Conference at Paris on the 30th of Mlarch last, and consequently, by the act of 1854. the increase would cease on the 5th of April next. That the ratification of the treaty, a formal act, was received on the 30th of May last, and thus by the act of 1855 the increase would not determine until 12 months after the 5th of April next. That this meeting, in common with the whole country, do protest against this discrepancy between the verbal provisions of two acts of Parliament being taken advantage of to impose on an overtaxed community a war-tax during two years after the war has terminated, and therefore require from the Government and Parliament a due fulfilment of the engagement with the country, freed from points of law-nauiely, that in 12 months from the 5th of April last, the increased income-tax imposed by reason of the wvar should cease and determine; and the increase of the revenue and the contemplated reduction in the army estimates, as stated by Lord Panmure, further justify this rational and moderate expectation of the people." The third resolution was as follows ' " That the act of 1853, which provides for the gradual reduction of the tax and for its total extinction in 1860, should be adhered to, and that steps should be taken immediately to render the law, while it exists, less inquisitorial in its provisions, and to cause the tax itself to be more equitsably levied, distinguishing between realized property and industrial capital, and between fixed and uncertain means, whether the latter accrue from the exercise of the learned professions, or in the fields of literature, or in the ordinary pursuits of trade." A petition founded upon the foregoing resolutions having been unanimously adopted the meeting broke up. County meetings for the same purpose were held on Tuesday in Derry and Carlow. On Vednesday (yesterday) the people of Belfast met to consider, in the words of the requisition, "4 what steps should be adopted for the purpose of having the income-tax reduced from the war rate." The proceedings have not yet come to hand; but the Belfast Mercury offers the following advice with respect to the impolicy of the meeting seeking for the total abolition of the income-tax:- "We expressed the other day our opinion on the inequalities of the tax, and need not, therefore, advert to the injustice inflicted on the community by the nonrecognition of the palpable distinction between fixed and fluctuating income. But the meeting to-day is not to consider this; it is only called to consider the pro. priety of reducing what is called the war-rate, and we realythink the gentlemen who will assemble, perhaps to 'waste their sweetness on the desert air,' would do weeU to consider this simple question-whether the tax is not the very best that could be imposed, as tending to develope the resources of the country,-to stimulate manufacturing, commercial, and general trading industry by the gradual and natural expansion of the Free Trade principle. We are not going to argue the question, but we would just venture to hint that it would be well for the speakers to revert to the immense results of the Free Trade principl-the unlooked-for increase in our exports, the wondes'ol expansior of our trade, and, above all, the 'reat increase of domestic comfort to our manufacturing and labouring population consequent upon the buoyancy and activity of our commercial rosperity, not to speak- of the vast aggregation of nationa wealth,-all this resulting from the partial operation of the Free Trade principle. Let them consider that -we must pay taxes,-that, speaking in round numbers, the interest on the national debt requires 23,000,0001. a-year, and the otherservices of the State caU for some .30,000,0001. additional, making, at thevery least, a sum of 53,000,0001. short,of whichtheexigeneiesof theStatecannot bemet. Letthemref'ectonthis, andthen, revertingtothe1past, decide whether this annual revenue is to be raised by direct or by indirect taxation. If by indirect taxation, it can only be done by adhering to an exploded policy-the policy that upheld restrictions on trade, and put industry and enterprise in swaddling clothes. Sir Robert Peel achieved a vast deal in emancipating trade, in setting commercial enterprise comparatively free, and all we have to do, after some 10 years' experience, is to open the eyes of our understanding, look around, and behold the wonderful results. are we, then, to pursue this policy or to depart from it. Let the meeting to-day understand this, that the financial condition of the country will not bear the repeal of the income-tax. And, further, let this be understood, that presumingan amount of taxation could be repea equal to the produce of the income-tax, the question stil presses,-would it be more preferable to reduce or abolish the taxes that stiU press on industry and trammel enterprise, rather than reduce or abolish the income-tax? We hope, for the credit of our town, that a sensible view will be taken of this question. By all means seek to obtain an equitable adjustment of the tax as between fixed and fluctuating income; but do not let a great manufacturing, commercial, and industrial community like Belfast come out with staltifying notions about the reducetion of a tax which is the most equitable and the most just in its onerations that can be imposed." THE LATE B}ISHOP OF CORK. The local Roman Catholic organ (the Cork Baamiser) pays a just and graceful tribute to the memory of the late mild and tolerant prelate who for some eight or nine years presided over the united dioceses of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. The Bxaminer fairly remarks:- " The character and conduct of a bishop of the estabished church in this country do not by any means exclusively concern the members of his own fleck and his own communion ; on the contrary, they are of very great moment to the Catholic community of the diocess within his jurisdiction. Fortunately for the peace of this populous city and this greatest of Irish counties, the late Bishop Wilson was full of gentleness, and mildness, and charity, breathing kindness and peace to all around him; yet not the ess devoted to his own creed, or the less faithful to his own chureh, because he was tolerant of the creed and respectful to the church of his Catholic neighbours, fellow. citizens, and fellow-countrymen. It is impossible to appreciate the value of such an example of mildness and moderation as Dr. Wilson gave in his own person to his clergy and his flock. In estimating theimportance of such an example, we must rather look at the large number of clergymen of the dioecess who perfonrm their ministrations without givin offence to those who differ from them than to the smal nun,ber who occasionally forget that charity is the abiding principle of Christianity, and ought to le the animating spirit of the Christian pastor. So long as his health perinitted of his appearing in puble, the late bishop was at aU times ready to assist in fuithering every object useful to his fellow-citizens; and on every occasion of his mixing with his Catholic brethren he inspired their respect and confidence by his bearing and deportment, and by that utter absenee of ostentation or pretence which characterized him in a special and honourable degree. The selection of a successor to the deceased prelate rests with the Crown,and is really exercised by the Government; and, though many motives frequently influence those who exl ercise this most important patronage, we earnestly trust that some consideration for th.A ,p,,A .'A .- - -t - district equal in extent and population to the one-eighth of Ireland may guide them in sheir choice of one who is to held an exalted position, and who, of necessity, must command a very large share of influence, which ought to be for good, but which might be for eviL A sincere and zealous Protestant should alone be intrusted with an office of such anthoti1ty, but with sincerity and zeal we should like to see th samevirtues which adorned the character of Dr. Wilson." A letter from Cork states that a movement is on foot among the Roman Catholic party to have the present Archdeacon of Cork appointed bishop, the Archdeacon being deservedly popular with the Roman Catholics.. Meanwhile, the Coiunty and City of Cork Protestant Association have presented his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant withthe follow- ing address relative to the appointment of a succes] sor to the late Bishop of Cork *- "To his Excellency, &c.-We, the members of the com. mittbe of the County and City of Cork Protestant Association, desire to addrees you on the occasion of the lamented death of the bishop of this diocess. " We beg respectfully to remind yOUr Excellency of the solemn responsibility involved in the appointment of a person to suth an importantand high ofice as that of bishop in the church of Christ.

There were 39 magistrates present, and. the chair was taken by Lord Clarina. It was moved by Mr. Maxwell, and seconded by Mr. J. S. Dwyer, that a memorial be presented to the LordLieutenant, praying for a reduction of 100 of the County of Limerick constabulary. An amendment was moved by I\Ir.

The TiPperary Free Press has the following anecdote in connexion with the recent run for gold in the south of lreland:- " WVe understand that a respectable farmer in this locahity, who during the prevalence of the Bank panic withdrew the money he had lodged in the National Bank here, died suddenly within the past few days. The gold he received he conveyed home, and, for security, hid it in some place which he kept secret from his family. His death occurring so unexpectedly prevented their becoming acquainted with the place in which it w as concealed, and since his demise, although they have made every search to discover the hidden treasure, they have up to this time been unsuccessfuL We have heard that many farmers have acted in the same feoish manner as above described, and this case may be to them a warning to guard against eventualities that no human foresight can prevent, by adopting a course different from that mentioned above, the accuracy of which may be fully relied upon."

THE BUSSIVAS IN CBNTRAL ASIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The letters of "A Hertfordshire Incumbent" are always read with interest, but it appears to me that the present tendency of Russian influence in Central Asia is somewhat different from that hinted at in the "Incumbent's" letter of the 3d inst. The most recent, though stiUl imperfect, accounts that we have would indicate Turan as the seat of operations-that is the Khanats of Kokan, Bokhara, Khiva, &c. Persia is stiU a considerable Power, with a large army for an Oriental State, intimately connected by diplomatic relations with European allies, and offering little opportunity for secret advances towards the Indian frontier. On the contrary, the small principalities comprised in what is called Turan afford every facility for their powerful neighbour to engulf them in the 3maelstrom of her progress; and, indeed, while public attention was caUed to the Russian expedition against Khiva, and more recently to the aggressions against Turkey, how little is known of the progress made by Russian diplomacy and Russian troops further east ! Yet we are assured on the best authority that within the last 10 or 15 years no less than 20,000 German square miles of territory have been absorbed in the vast dominions of the Czar. The further south the more valuable the acquisition. Russian Siberia is no longer aU waste and barren, for it contains an Italy, the country between the Balkash and Issykull lakes being so called from its fertile and genial climate. In the Khanat of Kokan Russia has been working like a mole under ground, secure from inter. forence, and ceaselessly pushing on her conquests. These semi-barbarous States, ever at feud with one another, and in themselves weak,are yethighlyfertilein parts,and attractive enough to an invader. That they must be so is clear from the fact that 300,000 Russian troops are stationed along the frontier lying between the Caspian Sea and the Balkash Lake,-a force most assuredly not required for detensivepur. poses only. As for us, we must remain within the Suleiman range of hils skirting the Indus. Once beyond this barrier, no line or limit can be drawn, and no secure frontier obtained. We have to withstand and repress petty inroads of wild Wuzeerees, Afreedees, and others; but we effect this with ease, while it is unlikely that any large body of men would attempt to force these mountains while the passes were held by us and our troops remained faithful. Our system of Indian government is too costly and too intricate to be remunerative or appreciated in a half-civilized country like Affghanistan, and the natural line of demarcation presented by the Suleiman range should be maintained inviolate, if possible. The same aggressive spirit shown by Russia in Turan shows itself on the Chinese borders. Names like Nikolayevsk and Alexandrovsk, in the country watered by the Amoor, show that the "green" line has estended from lat. 540 to lat. 51. within the last four or five years, A Coasack picket is advanced, shops spring up, a colony is formed, then a town, lastly a fortress, and so a large tract of territory is absorbed. The present crisis in China affords us an opportAunity long wished for of establishing, as you judiciously suggest, a Minister at Pekin, where our influence is nit; while it is credibly asserted that there are no less than 10,000 Russian subjects in that city. Should matters proceed to extremities, we can accomplish one of two things,-namely, stop the grain junks on their way up the Grand Canal to Pekmn (a measure which the rebels, though in possession of Chin-kang-foo, have not sneceeded in accomplishing, though we could easily effect it), or else, better still, send gunboats up the Peiho River, which is inpassable for ships of large burden. Little can be gained by knocking at a back door like Canton. The time for revising the English treaty has already arrived. English, Americans, and French have all cause of dissatisfaction with the Chinese Government. In the last treaty we obtained privileges instead of demanding rights, the conquerors asking favours from the conquered. There is a growing and natural tendenoy in the commercial community of China to hesitate to pay duties to a G overmment not able to enforce them, though we are bound by treaty to assist that Government in their collection. On the revision of the treaty we should demand as a right the same privileges which we ourselves accord to the Chinese in all our possessions. Missionaries and travellers should be free to come and go; commerce should be unrestricted, by which only we can hope that smuggling and corruption wil disappear; and, lastly, it is essential that we should have a high dignitary at head-quarters, with powers to insist on due observance of treaty obligations, and a becoming respect towards their European brethren on the part of our Celestial a,lies. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. B. a. S. -ixeter, Jan. 7.

SOLUTION OF QuABTz.-The Australian papers just received from Melbourne report the discovery, by Caunt Dembinski, of a process by which quartz or silica is chymically dissolved, and aUi the gold, metallic oxides, and metals contained in it precipitated. His method is the following:One part of quartz in small pieces is, together with two and-a-half or three parts of carbonate of soda, brought to a red heat and melted. Cast iron tubes are perhaps the best vessels in which this process can be done. Silicate of soda is now formed, deliquescent in air, and perfectly soluble in cold water, the carbonic acid of the soda being, of course, given off by the reaction. This silicate of soda is dissolved in water, in wooden vessels, amd thus left for a few hours, during which tine the gold and all other foreign substances contained in the quartz are precipitated. After the precipitate lkas been formed the solution of silicate of srda is, by means of a syphon, decanted,i;to another woo4eL vessel, in which, by the.inflation of carbonic acid, tho soda is seperated from the silicic ac d, and regained as carbonate of soda By decanting it again and evaporating the water it is made iit for another dissolving process. He obtains the carbonic aeid, which is used for regenerating the soda, from the same fire which he makes use of in combining the quartz and soda. This he does by employing the well-known centrifugal air-pump, and follows up in ii particulars the method of Melsens in the decomposing of saceharate of lime. By inflating carbonic acid into the solution of silieaLe of soda he separatesthe silicic acid from the soda. This Ie remains in water, tke eilicic cd h*s been recipitatedrin the form of a transparent, nebolous, jelly-ne sbta ce, which cannot be separated from water by filtration. He now decants the solution of carbonate of soda, which, by means of evaporation, he obtains again as dry carbonato of soda. As such is can be made use of in further operations.

THE STAFF AND MEDICAL OFFICERS OP THE CRIMEAN ARMY. TO TE1 EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is rather a malicious jest for " An Otlicer on the Staff at Head-Quarters," who was in his bed every night, to insinuate, as a matter of history, that durini the CrimeLn war medical officers were shy of shot and shell, when their duties in the trenches, in the advanced field hospitals, in the ravines, and on the battle plains of the Alma, Balaklava, and Inkermann, necessitated personal exposure to the enemy's fire. At the Alma scores of amputations were performed within range of shot, and one surgeon (Gordon, 95th Regiment) was wounded. At Balakl-va many of the medical officers were with the Artillery batteries. At Inkermann, two assistant-surgeons (Elkington, of the Coldstreams, and Wolsely, of the 20h Regiment) were wounded, and one of the 57th Regiment (*cott) had his clothes riddled with bullets and his horse killed. In the trenches followed the death of Assistant-Surgeon O'Leary, 68th Regiment, kiUed by round shot During the bombardment of the 9th of April, Assistant-Surgeon Cockeril, Royal ArtiUery, was wounded. On the 18th of June, in the attack on the Redan, several assistant-s8rgeons were called into the open field and publicly mnentioned. On the same day some of the field hospitals were established close under our batteries on the Woronzoff-road and near the cemetery, 'where medical officers of al grades were at work for several hours under a heavy fire, and others mounted on horseback riding on business up and down the ravines. At the battle of the Tchernaya medical amateurs were abundant and exposed in all directions, from Sir T. Hall downward& Iforgot to mention that at Inkermann Asdstant-Surgeon Wilson, 7th Hussars,rallied a few of the Gurds, and rendered some acsistano to the Duke of Cambridge,who mentions Wilson in his despatches. Does not the "St3ff Officer" know that one assistant-surgeon of a regiment always goes into action with the men-that it is the rule of the service-and a ery questionable one too? So notorious was the constant expostre of medical officers in the trenches from calls upon them between the rear and advanced trenches, during bombardments, -saults, sorties, and the ordinary firing of tke Russian sharpshooters, that General Estcouzt issued an order in the end of April, 1855, t4t.

BA2WCRr*RW AaT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -Your correspondent " Mercator" thanks you for the insertion of his firstletter, "ihichencourages him to pursue the subject." I bxve similar thank-s to offer for tho insertion of my reply to it, and I *m enconraged to hope that, asz y answer to the second will be very short, I also may obtain the favour of its insertion. The first 14 paragraphs, nearly two-thirds of the first column, of "Mtercator's" letter are given to a laudatory history of the act of 1844, according to the views of those who support it. It begins by stating " that the act of 1844, though founded on scientific principles, was eminently a measare of a practical character." The first part of this proposition begs the whole question, and is the point at issue. The second is a truism not worth stating. The only circumstance in the narrativo itself to which I needdemuristhat, thonugh itdoos not state the factin somany words, still it leads to the inference that the whole scheme was Sir Robert Peel's, and the resalt of " the application of his practical mind" to the question. I should think no one knows better than "Mlercator" that this is not an ccurate statement; but it seems an attempt adroitly to influence the world by the sanction of his great and lamented name. Sir Robert Peel did not invent the theory, although he supported it, and it was Ilso mainly by his influence that it was not put an end to in 1S47. I feel convinced that ifhe were now living the experience we have since obtained would have induced him to change his opinion, and to assist in the repeal of the aet of 1814. But to proceed. The 15th paragraph of "hMercator's" letter is as follows :-" The question which now comes before the country is this,-Whether the act of 1844 ought to be renewed in its present form, or with modifications, or repealed altogether "' "Mercator" desires the first, and therefore he need not have troubled himself with the second term of his proposition; but he does so, and argues at great length, and with many words, "against the courage which claims the privilege of ranning away whenever the danger becomes great, which shrinks when the trial is severe and the pain acute; that the introduction of a relaxing power would be a public declaration inserted in the act itself that its provisions shall not be enforced when those peculiar circumstances occur which render the provisions of the act necessary;" and this is folrowed out through the latter half of the ltter. "Mercator" may be assured that in all this the school to which I belong entirely concurs; yet there was a time, in 1847, when men's courage did fail, when " discretion was proved to be the better part of valour," when men did run away "Mercator," probably, among the number-and when, to use the words of one best qualified to judgo in reply to the following question,-" Supposing the letter of the Government had not been issued, but that the act, in its ful force, had been carried out into unmitigated operation, what, in your opinion, would have been the effect?' hegave thisanswer:-" Ithink thewisest in the citycannot calculate; my firm persuasion is that it would have ended in the infringement of the law or the stoppage of the Bank; it would have prodaced very great calamity and extreme alarm all overthe country. The ultimate consequence, no one can calculate. ty owrn opinion is that it would have run to a great national calamity." (S. Gurney, Questions 1603, 1604, Committee on Commercial Distress, 1843.) Even the greatest supporter of the bilI of 1844, before the same committee, Mr. Jones L3yd, " thought it was right, under all the circumstances then existing, to issue the letter." This opinion is, however, now to be ignored, no such dispensing power is to exist, the country may be rained to support a theory, and their consolation is to be found in such high-sounding phrases as-" that weakness and irresolution in the hour of trial afways prove false friends to those who foolishly place reliance in them; they lead not to honour or to safety, but are the fatal guides to disgrace and danger," &c. This part of the subject, however, having been thus disposed of by " Mercator," the only issue left for the discussion is this,-is the act of 1844 to be repealed or not? This question is a very simple one, and it may be put thus -Will you have a currency contingent on the mere amount of bulion in one department of the Bank, and a rate of interest rising or falling as that incessantly variable barometer indicates? Will yon have a rate of interest which, between 1848 and October, 1S5.5 was changed 26 times, varying from 2 per cent, to 7 per cent?-or, as in the last year, changing nine times in 12 months, with a variation in rate from 4i to 7 percent. ? Will you have, as in 1847, a pressure amounting almost to ruin, with the Bank reserve below a miUion, with the anomaly of the rate of exchange rising and six milions of gold uselessly lying within 20 yards of an exhausted Exchequer? Wil you have an approach to a panic annuaUy; or will you put an end to this mischievous act, and aUow the Bank of England, or the issuers of bank-notes, to be guided by a common-sense view of all the circumstances of a commercial crisis, and to act without the convulsive jerks of an ill-constructed and il-regulated machinery-ruinous to the merchant, but affording large profits to the banker .7 " Mercator" appeals to facts for an answer to these questions. So do L Between 1819 and1844 there had been panica and perils, all weathered safely and successfully. It is true banking profits were not what they now are. Is this an explanation of the anxiety ot " Mercator," and others of his class, to abide by the provisions of the act of 1844 ? I am, sour obedient sem,-vt CIVLS. Jan. 7.
Foon.-A custom has long prevailed at the close of the year of taking a wholesome and profitable retrospect of our affairs. This habit is not confined to individualslarge corporations, public and private companies, do the same thing; journalists give retrospective sketches, dwell on their past successes, and abound with promises of still more meritorious efforts. Our readers may, many of them, have been employed in some such usefal stock-takings during the put week. We do not propose on this occasion to endeavour to aid them in that portion of their important labours; our business now is with future probabilities, using merely the results of past experience as imperfect data on which to rest our calculations It is almost needless to search into the history of pnrces as a guide; for in these we have been commonly at the mercy of the seasons, of high or low mean summer temperatures, or varying rainfalls. We need only compare the prices of wheat in the corresponding years of different centuries to be convinced of this ; for instance, the average price of wheat per quarter was in L'd. ad4. L d.

But then there are other conbiderations which arise from the statistics of p4st years that wvll probably not be without their use. He will reflect that the advance of knowledge, and of consequent peace and security, is leading to vast increase of corn cultivation In countries hitherto far too ill. verned for agriculture to flourish; he will not forget thatner on ward steps are never fund among the wild hordes of the earth-that they are baraly traceable in the lands of the serf. Such an inquirer too will reflect on the increasing corn cultivation of the American far-west- on the improving agriculture of more than one portion of Africa; on the opening out of the rich valley of Armenia by the proposed Euphrates Railway, and of many other at-present-neglected £elds, the certain effect of A constantlv open English market. Then, again he will note that while tho fereign sUpiy increases the home demand for food is steadily enl g and this accelerated consumption, he it remem , is not to be attributed merely to a numerical hcease of the population. It is to a large extent caused by the great addltion which is now stedily nsaking to the better-fed portion of our worling cbsses-a result which is the sure attendant of an enlarged demAnd for skilled labour. The cultivators of ouriilande, te are much more deeply interested in the increase of oiannmanufactures, in the demand for our machinery, andour capital forforeiga railways, thau we were once wont to consider. Moreover this demand for food is not confined'to- bread; the demand for animal food also increases with equal rapidity. The ckilful, well-paid machine-ma%ser is- not the- maii, whose merits or whose means are adaptod. to. A bread-and-eheese et; he has better exppctations and rights The demand tor anmal food, then, increases, and wil probably eontintue to do so, as long as England shall go boLnding an in her career.

THE FBAV:DSONPRH rTy OPLOZVDOZ UNIog4,; Jolm PAul, the late asistant-clerk to the Paor IAw Union of the City of London, who is charged with eambezxlement and forger- to the amount of some thousands of tinds wras again brougt before the LORD MAYOR yestrday for further exammnahon. A great number of the guardians of the poor of the city were present.- Mr. Humphreyx again appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Woutner attened as heretofore on the part of tbc prisoner. ralteh ato h Mr. Goodman read the depouitions taken at the last ciaIninKtion in a case in whicb the prisoner was charged with having, on tho 19th of November last, feloniously forged aLnd uittered a roceipt for the payment. of 290f~ with irntent to defraud Mr. . Woodvard, a collector of rates, in thw city. Ihe LORD MAYOR, after givrng tho usual caution to the prisoner, asked him whether he had anyhi,g to say in anawer to the charge. Prisoner. -I leave the case to my soRicitor. Ho was then fully committed upon thie charge. Mir. W. S. Flinders, a cashier in the- house of Messirs. Smith, Payne, and Smiths, was then called for te purpose of completing another charge, pr¢vioy entertw upon, against the prisoner ofhavingstolen achoek for378M 15se. 6d. belonging to the guardians of the union. Mr. Flinders said -The cheek p roduced for 37Sf. 15 6i was paid by me with other checks on the 13th of Sep6ber lat to- the Lank of London. The Court was kept waiting a considerable time on account of the non-arnial of Mr. Glanvill, a clerk in the, Bank of London, who was exaunined at the last bearing oF the case, and who was now wanted in order that he might sign his deposition at length. Mir. Humphreys said,- My Lord, I am very sor;y to say that a gentleman who was emined before, and who, damefrom the Bank of London, refuses now, notwithstanding a, message from tho Mansion-house. to attend without a sumnions. He has been Fent for, and has refused to come. The LORD MAYOR (with warmth).-This is very extraordinary conduct on the part of a servant of a large establishment like that. Mr. Goodman.-On the last oocasion I directed that. witness to attend to-day. The LORD bLAYOR.-Let a warrant be made out immediately, and I will sign it. We shaU soon have him herethen. 3rk. Hamphreys-Thore maybe some misapprehension, or some mistake, or some pressing basiness which has caused a wrong message to be sent, not to your Lordship, hut to the attorney in the case. I should not like to apply for - warrant under these circumstances, but perhaps your Lordshlp will grant a summons. lhe LOR. MAvOR.-I will grant a peremptory summons, then. A large number of witnesses ought not to ber detained here because of the refusal of this man to attend. Mr. Humphreys.-My clerk has been to the Bank of London, and says that the witness refuses to attend unleseummoned. The LORD BMAYoR.-I should think that theprincipals of' that bank are not aware that such a message has been sent to the Mansion-house. Mr. Humphreys.-The only excuse I can offer for the message is, that it is not to your Lordship, but to me, The LORD MAYOI.-It is the interest of aU parties to do. everything that lies in their power for the purpose of furthennr the ends of justicoe in a case like thi. Mr. rumphreys.-I have never applied for a summons against a clerk in a banking-house before, because I have' considered that it would be an offensive thing to gentlernen, in their position. The LORD AMAYOR.-I should think so. A summons in very seldom, if ever, required in the case of respectableparties. A summons was issued forthwith for the attendance of the witness Mr. Glan-itl, who in about 10 minutes (and before, we believe, the document reached hinm) made hie appearance in court, when The LORD MAYOR, addressing him, said,-I am sorry to find that you thought it necessary to send a message here that you refused to attend without a summons. You haver by your act caused great delay in tho businesw here, and detainod a number of witness whose time is rmost valuable to them. Such conduct is anything but satisfactory. It is not usual for gentlemen in your position to act in this manner. Mr. GlanvilL -There are only three or four in our banr, and if I had come when sent for there would have been nobody to attend at the counter I told the messenger so. The LORD MALKYOR.-I understood that the messag given by you was, that yOU refused to attend without a summons. Mr. GlanviU.-The cashier who releved me had just come from his dinner. This witness was then sworn, and his depositiom haiving been read over to him he signed it. The prisoner, who said he should leave the matter in the hands of his solicitor, was then fuly committed for trial upon this second charge. Mr. Humphreys.- will now proceed with a csoe respecting a check for 425K. 123. 2d., drawn bythe guardians of the City of London Union on the 17th of June laet in favour of the London Life Association. That check wasintrusted to the prisoner, and we find by his passbook, and upon inquiry, that it was paid by kim. to. hiaown banking account at the Bank of London; it wast afterwards paid by Messrs. Smith and Payne, on. the parb. of tho union, and never has teen paid to the Loindon Life Association. It was the custom for Messr Smith and Payne to send their checks back to their cuatomer3 after having paid them, as it is the custom of almost all banking houses. But this check, like a variety of othess, has been, searched for, and cannot be found. We sha}l thereforelasve. more links in the chain than are usually necessarr for the purpose of proving the receipt of this check. We shal haveto produce the counterfoil of it, of which, fortunately, we are in possession, by one of the committee who-was present at the time that this check was drawn. I propose to-day to call one of the guardians, who will prove that he was present at the time the chock was drawn, and I shall also produce a witness from the. Bnlc of London to prove that they receivedt that check on account of the prisoner's private account.

FOBEIGN INTELLIGBNCE. THE CONFERENCES OF PARIS. (FBOM OUR OWN CORBRSPOND,NT.S.) fA portton of the following appeaml la our wond "I;on .f ywterd&y:-1 PARIS, WYD.NSDAY, JAN. 7, 6 P.M. I was not mistaken when I mentioned yesterday that the Plenipotentiaries would bring their labours I to a conclusion at their sitting last evening. The telegraph will have already brought you the news of the signing of the Protocol, which purports to tenninate the difficulties that have hitherto pre- I vented the execution of the Treaties of the 30th of March. The result thus obtained so far proves how much in the right we were in exacting from Russia the complete execution of the articles of the Treaty. Much yet remains to do, and the utmost vigilance is still necessary; but, so far as matters have gone, there is cause for satisfaction. The Moniteur announces in the following terms -what may be tled IIthe last appearance for the Eeason"l of the Conference:- " The Representatives of the contracting Courts to the Congress of Paris, assembled this day (Tuesday, Jan. 6) in conference at the hotel of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a protocol, which puts an end to the difficulties encoountered in the execution of the treaty of the 30th of March. "It is known that the nature of the locality did not allow theBoundary Commission to come to an understanding upon all the points of the now frontier line between Turkey ia Europe and Russia ; on the other hand, it became necessary to make upifor the silence which the treaty had observed as to the fate of the Isle of Serpents; finally, the strict appli. cation of the 21st article, by annexing the Delta of the Danube to Moldavia, took away from the immediate sovereigunty of Turkey a territory which formerly was directly a dependency of the Sublime Porte. " Inspired with the resolutions of the Congress, and wishing to conciliato all interests, the Conferenoe, by unani. mous onsenat, has decided that the frontier line shall follow the Vale of Trajan as far as the river Yalpuck, leaving Bolgrad and Tabak to Moldavia, and that Russia shall retain on the right bank of that stream the town of Komrat, with a territory of about 300 square versts. " The Isle of Serpents has been considered as belonging to the mouths of the Danube, and it has been agreed that it goes with their destination. "The Conference has recognized that it was the intention of the Congrees to r"establish, by Art. 21 of the Treaty of Poece, in their former condition the tenitories situated west of the new boundary, and to conform itself to the previsions of the negotiators of the peace; it has decided that those territories shall be annexed to Moldavia, -with the exception of the Delta of the Danube, which returns I direcUy to Turkey. " It has been deCided, moreover, that on the 30th of next March, at latest, the fixing of the boundary shall be effected, and that at that same date the Austian troops and the British squadron shall have evacuated the Danubian Principalities and the intemal waters of Turkey. " The Commission of the Principalities, the members of which are already at Constantinople, may therefore at that period proceed to the provinces, and fulfil the mission in. trusted to it. As soon as that Commis3ion shall have terminated its labours, it wil render an account thereof to the Confereneo, which will meet at Paris, according to the terms of the 25th Article of the treaty, to sanction, by a convention, the final agreement come to between the contracting parties relative to the organization of the Principalities." A private telegraphic despatch mentions that, in consequence of the boisterous weather in the Black Sea, the English shipe that were in observation near the Isle of Serpents had to take refuge in the mouth of the Danube. The following particulars relative to the late Journey of M. Furrerto the German States are given in a letter dated Berne, the 5th inst. - " On the 26th of December, the eve of the opening of the F,ederal Assembly, the Federal Councll received a despatch from X, Hirzel, Swiss Consul-General at Leipsic, announcing that the Duke of Saxe-Coburg wished earnestly to speak vith a delegate of the Federal authority on the question of Neuchatel, and if the Swiss Confederation would send a delegate for that purpose conditions favourable to Switzerland should be proposed to him. The Duke being brotherin-law of the Queen of England, and being related by marriage to the King of Prussia, the Federal Council inferred from this proposition that the Duke was charged with an important mission, either on the part of the British Governmaeat alone, or on the part of Great Britain and Prussia, and they could not, consequently, refuse this new chance of an amicable arrangement, which gave rise to the journey of Is Furrer to Frankfort. This functionary received orders to listen to any proposition made to him, and to refer to his Government. The nature of the Duke of Saxe-Gotha's prooositions have not been published; all that is known Is that hi. Furrer's minsion failed. x Furrer was further commissioned to visit on his return the Courts of Carlsrahe, Stuttgard, and Munich, in order to ascertain the intention of those States as to the passage of Prussian troops to attack the Swiss. It is known that the Governments of Csrlsruhe and Stuttgard are favourable to Prussia." It is stated as certain that the Grand Duke Con8tantine, who, I believe, is expected at Berlin on the 10th, will pay a visit to Paris. He will take up his quarters in the Elysee. The brother and sister-in-law of Verger, the atsassin, have been arrested. The doubts entertained by one or two organs of the London press with respect to the justifiable character of the bombardment of Canton are not shared by the Paris journals. Thus the Univers, -which wil never be considered as a partisan of England, and which from its clerical character must be r,garded as hoatile to unnecessary bloodshed, decidedly approves the measures takenF by the British Admiral, and says - "IWe have before our eyes the Chinese version of the causes which led to the bombardment of Canton. Many persons, even in England, are pleased to accept this version and to accuse Admiral Seymour of having seized the first pretext which presented itself in order to carry out an at. tack that had long been premeditated. Our oorrespondent from Hoagkong, who is anything but an Englishman. asserts that this accusation is by no means founded on truths It must not be forgotten, moreover, that BEropean Powers have for a long time past had a thousand legitimate reasonfor chastising the Chinese in an exemplary manner. if anytbing is to surprise us, it is not the bombardment of Canton, but the patience with which Christian Europe has endured for centuries the insolence and deceit of this bar barous nation.'

It appears by official returns that the quantity of wheat imported here between the 1st of January and the 31st of December, 1856, amounts to 5,018,732 hectolitres. The portion which arrived since the 1st of August amounts to 4,098,660 hectolitres. This large supply, which has been for the most part Absorbed by the southern and southeastern departments, shows how deficient the last harvest has been in those countries. The wheat imported into Marseillea in the year 1855 did not exceed 2,602,700 hectolitres. The importations in 1 866 exceeded that amount by 2,138,700 hectolitres. Biesides wheat, Marseilles has imported during the last year 1,007,176 hectolitres of maize, barley, and Tye. Of the wheat imported last year the ports in the Sa of Azoff gave us 1,400,000 hectolitres ; the X ipgdoi of Naples, 920,000; the Black Sea, Q;%0 Xgypt, 500,000; Algeria, 280,000; Conuz1tip1e 180,000 hectolitrea, wEJvep~iwigands had been executed at Athens 3 The Greek Moiziwr accused the jturkisir hvernmnent of not preventing the formstigs os bands of Albpniaus, wtho inYaded the Greek territory.

On Tuesday last the second conference on the finnan respecting the convocation of the Divans (id hoc in the Principalities took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From what I understand the first subject which engaged the attention of the conference was the participation of the Comnmissioners in the conferences about the firman, and the decision in this respect is, that as soon as the general tenour of thefirmanshaflhave been drawnup the Commissioners will take part in elaborating the details. How necessary such a resolution was every one will understand who perused the Treaty of Paris without knowing anything of the protocola containing the articles. The Commissioners are to work with the Divans. How is this possible without taking part in the discions about the firman,which is to settle the manner of convocation of these Divans, the manner in which they are to deliberate, and the subjects which they are to consider ? The next thing which engaged the attention of the Conference was the representation of the clergy, and in this matter it was adopted, in principle, that the higher as well as the lower clergy should be represented in the Divan. I have not heard whether the relative proportion between the representation of the higher and lower clergy was settled. There was, as you will remember, some difference in this respect between the project of the Porte andthe amendments of the French Ambassador, the first proposing that the lower clergy should choose six members, while the latter wished to reatrict th4tt number to three. As for the representation of the Boyard class, the ideas contained in the amendments proposed by the French Ambassador have been accepted by the Conferences. These are, as you will remember, the election of the representatives of the great as well as of the lesser Boyards by the whole body of Boyards, and the extension of the property qualification likewise to the great Boyards. The Turkish project in this respect proposed that the great Boyards alone should choose the representatives of their own claw, and no property qualification was to have been required from the Boyarda thus elected. Thus, according to the decision of the last Conference, the representation of the Boyard class will be based on property as well as on rank. The news from the Principalities is rather more satisfactory than it was some time ago. The present Turkish Government Feems to have understood thefolly of violently sappresing the expression of public opinion on the inion, and has adopted a milder course in its yolicy. The Austrian army of occupation is likewise reported to behave much better. Except a few caes of excess, which, after all, are inseparable from an army of occupation, no complaints are heard from the inhabitanta. In the course of last winter I had to speak of the British Consular Hospital in this place as one of the dirtiest and most inefficient establishnienta of its kind. I am happy to state that it has become now one of the cleanest and best regulated hospitals which could be found anywhere. From the dreary old wooden house behind the Embassy, shut In by even more wretched houses, it has been transferred to a new building in Galata erected on purpose for it. The new hospital, built of stone, ia without any pretersions to sarchitecture, but is solid and simple. It is entirely separated from all surrounding houses, and enclosed by a wall, within the precincts of which are likewise the consular prison and the ground destined for the new consular offices. The Interior of the building leaves nothing to be desired. The wards are high and airy, with plenty of light, and a beautiful view over the Golden Horn. Hot-air tubes pass all over the house, establishing an equal temperature and promoting the ventilation of the place. As all the wards are in the upper stories, an apparatus has been sent out from England to hoist up the patients, which, especially in cases of fractures, is very convenient, as the patients can be dressed below, and are thus spared the pain which would otherwise attend their transport upstairs. The apparatus serves likewise for sending up the meals of the patients from the kitchen below, a convenience which serves also to preserve the cleanliness of the passages. As for the interior arrangements, Dr. Hoyland, under whose charge the hospital is, as well as the pison, deserves great credit. Even an eye rendeted ratherfastidious by the Scutari hospitals in their latter days would find nothing to criticize. The patient is surrounded by every comfort. Inthe furniture all the latest improvements have been adopted, some of them at r. Hoyland's suggestion. Part of it was sent out by the Board of Works, but not a little is due to Miss Nightingale, who, in spite of the manifold claims to . her exertions, did not overlook the seamen's hospital, and procured whatever she could for its outfit. The hospital attendants are now nearly all English, and among them is one of the nurses from Scutari. This, besides adding to the comfort of the patients, makes likewise the great cleanliness possible for which the hospital is remarkable. this cleanliness is not confined to the wards, but extends all over the house, down to the pantry and kitchen. Every ward is suppled with books and a game of draughts. The only things wanting as yet are a separate dead-house and a bath-room, for both of which purposea one of the apartments ofthe hospital is used at present. It is intended to buy a contiguous piece of ground in the rear of the hospital for these buildings. Since the close of the war the number of patients has been considerably reduced, and at the present moment it does not amount to more than 20. If great improvements have been made since the beginning of this year in the Consular Hospital, they are nothing in comparison wFith the changes that have taken place since that time in the consular prison. Indeed, the prisoners who have remained from that time must feel like men transported from one of the worst dungeonsof the dark middle ages to a gentle house of correction, managed with the philanthropic spirit of the l9th century. Not more than a year ago they were thrown together in one of the Turkish prisons of Kassim Pasha, uncared for, eaten up by vermin, and treated more like dangerous wild beasts than human beings. It was some improvement. when they were taken from these andshutupin a hulkwhich theTurkishGovern. ment had put at the disposal of the Consulate for that purpose; but even there they were not much better off, for, except that they were thus sepa rated from the worst outcasts, assassins, and highway robbers of th9 Ottoman empire, and were no longer brutally treated, the remained in the same state of filth and hopeless degradation, so that a man who entered the hulk for a comparatively small offence was almost sure to Come out a consummate ruffian. The new prison, a strong building of two stories high, is subdivided into good-sized and high wards, all vaulted, and containing, usually, six prisoners. One of the wards is appropriated to hospital urposes. The wards are flagged, and contain notiing but the beds and working implements of the prsoners. The prison is in charge of a special gaoler. his asistant, and a Turkish kavass, while all the sanitary arrangements axe under the inspection of Dr. oylanud, who has been just as suessful in keeping the prison clean as his hospital. Indeed, if anything can be objected to the new prison, it is that there are no means of punishing any offence against discipline, or even carrying out the heavy sentences of the law. Several of the prisoners are condemned to hard labour, but hitherto no mean have been found to give them any kind of labour, so that each conclave is left to its own reflections all day long. Dr. Hoyland proposes to get up a small treadmill, for the prisoners to grind their own corn, and tbwen to employ them on matting or other kinds of occupation. But hitherto nothing has been done in this respect. Then there are no cells, wrhich, as flogging has been given up, would be the most means of breaking in unruly spirits. The number of pri- soesat thi moment ls 40. While speaking of the Government establishments for curing the physical and moral disees of sailors and other British subjects,in Constantinople, I must drawyour attentionto ananalogous aubject,whichexcited lately public attention. Repeatedly English sailors-without a ship, discharged officers' servants, and others who remained behind after the war, have been brought iato the Consular Hospital dying from cold and starvation. An inquiry into the subject showed that there were about 50 or 60 such persons, without work or any other means of subs£istence, hangingX aboult the town, sleeping in the pontoons of the bridge or anywhere else, anA trying to live by all kinxds of dev,icei, fair or fouL. No doubt thero may be more than one of them. who is an incorrigible vagabond and. "loafer," but there are certainly many who by the close of the war foundthemselves without workandmeans of susistence, hnd who would be glad to get out of the precarious state of exiutenea they ate leading. Dr. Hoyland, whose attention the subject first excited, having questioned the men who were brought in starved, proposes to get up a house of refuge, in which the men could remain during a night and get their soup in the morning. A list of sublscriptions has been opened for this purpose which yields ahleady 1601. sterling. Beside this, what is even more important, several Englishmen in business have offered to employ those who are sent to them with a recommendation from Dr. Hoyland. Thus, by degrees, these men could be got rid of. Those who should prove themselves I inveterate vagabonds could be sent away by the Consul, and the place thus cleared from what, in I the eyes of the Turks, and of everybody else, must be a disgrace to the English name. Feruk Ehan left this on Monday afternoon last for Marseilles. He embarked on board the French man-of-war Roland, which had been sentup on purpose to take him. When Ferak Khan went on board he was saluted with the usual I number of guns, and the Persian flag hoisted at the main. Before leaving, Feruk Khan went to pay his farewell visit to the British Ambassador, who returned his visit. The last act in the negotiations carried on here was the sending a messenger by Feruk Khan, carrying the demands of the BritishGovernment to Teheran. About tbe same time that the messejiger left the news of the declaration of war against Persia reached us. From the date (the I at of November), it is clear that it had been sent out to India long before Feruk Khan arrived here, so there is stil reason to hope that the negotiation with Feruk Khan may not be altogether without results, especially as the proclamation gives the siege of Herat as the cause of the declaration of war and, as I informed you, Feruk Khan promised solemnly in the name of his Government that Herat should be given back and the Heratees indemnified. On the other hand, the last news from Persia announces thatthe Shahhas namedthe Sadr Azam his Lieutenant for life, which, as the British Government demanda his dismissal, looks like a defiance. There can be no doubt that, if war is the result, the Russians will not remain neutral, and the longtalked of and prophesied collision between RuSSia and England in Asia can scarcely be avoided. Sir Stephen Lakeman, iSeutenant-General in the Turksish service, hns arrived here. AUSTRTA. (Io oUR oW R.) VIENNA, JW. 5. In his letter of the 31st of Deoember a semiofficial correspondentof the Frankfifurter Post Zeitung fully confirms the infornation recently received from me relative to the policy of Austria on the Neuchatel question. Austria fully recognizes the rights of Prussia on Neuch&tel, and is willing to support them " in a diplomatic way," as she is by the London protocol of May, 1852. Austria is of opinlion that te prisoners zmust be un|conditionally liberated before the parties to the above-mentioned London protocol can undertake to mediate between Prussia and Switzerland. The Imperial Government approves the last proposition made by France, because it is based on the liberation of the prisoners without trial. Austria is of opinion that the King of Prussia ought not to be subjected to any external pressure calculated to induce him to renounce his sovereign rights, but she also thinks " that no measures ought to be employed against the Swiss Confederation which could endanger its neutrality and existence, and its internal orgauzation as a State." As things now stand, it would be unwise to employ " armed pressre" against any Central European State, unless the political institutions of thiat State should render it positively dangerous to the neighbouringr countries or to Europe at large. It is not clear whether the dislke of Austria to Prussia, or a desire to see justice done to all parties, makes this Government display such moderation; but, be the cause what it may, the policy of Austria on the NeuchMtel question is extremely dignified, and, as it appears to me, extremely wise. The electric telegraph has to-day brought some most important news from Stuttgard. The Committee of the Estates} (isst)ii r XSAuschuss) has unanimously resolved to request the Government not to permit Prussian troops to march through the kingdom. It must be well understood byyour readers that theyU,ndischerAsschwi ss,which has thus made common use with the Wurtembergc tadicals, is composed of highly conservative elements. Any interruption to the good neighbourly relations betleen Switzerland and Wurtember;g could hardly fail to produce a commercial crisis in the latter country, as the Swis3 purchase fully one-third of the corn which they consume in Upper Swabia (the district between the Danube and the Lake of Constance). Immense quantities of salt, which is a Government monopoly, are also sent from Wurtemborg to the conterinous Swiss cantons. In Upper Bavaria (the districts around Dillingen, Eempten, ac) the news that permission has been granted to the Prbsians to march tough the country has caused the greatest discontent, as the corn trade between Bavaria and Switzerland brings very large sums in hard dollars into thefirot-menthoned country. IndesdK the high read fromAugsburg, byway of Dillingen and Eempten, to Lindau, is popularly known as the "Korn-Strasse" (Corn-road). Accerdne to the NYw emberg Corresmde, it " no longer Sadits of a doubt" that the .Neuchatel question will be settled by a conference, composed of the parties to the London protocol of 182 aind a representative of the Swiss Confederation. The Swus acrs als-eurier confirms the newsof apetition having beenaddressed by the Royalists of NeuchAtel to the King of Prussia, in which His Majesty is earnestly reauested not to make any attack on Switzerland. the Federal Council has been petitioned by some of the inhabitants of NeuchLtel to recall the Swis regiments from Naples and Rome. According to authentic communications from Wurtemberg and Bavaria the Swiss manufacturers are dismising such of their workmen as profess ultra-Liberal opinions and sending them across the frontier. 600 or 700 have already arved in Upper Swabia and Upper Bavaria. lt is by such measures that the prudent Republicans replyto the charge bromgha against them by the Emperor of the French. M. turrer, the SWiaS Envoy Extraordina.-y to the Court of Bavaria, has already had an audience of Baron von der Pfordten, the ePreiden. At 10 o'clock in the morning of the 3d Vinstant their Majesties the Emperor and Empress of Austria left Venice for Padta, where they were to p the 3d and 4dth (Saturday and Sunday). This day (Monday) will be spent in V.- cenza, andto.morrowtheirMajestiesawillreahVerona, where they will remain for some time. Our private advices from the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom are on the wrhole favourable, but no one here believes that the Italians are sincerely grateful to the Em-. prero for the benefits received. SARDINA The Pledmontese Chambers were opened by King Victor Emmanuel in person on the 7th inst.,. His Majesty met with the wrarmest reception. A letter in the Mfonileur dated Genoa, January 4, says,- "The Russian Rear-Admiral Behrens, at present craizing off the Spanish coast, is expected at Genoa with his squodron, consisting of the Wiborg man.of-war, the frigateg Polkan and Castor, and the brig Pbiloctie Be wllebe joined by the frigate Olaff, sationed at Villefranche, asd the squadron will await in our port the arrival ofthe Grnd Duke Constantine, which is shortly ezei t " The transfer of the navy of rdiniatomGnoa to Spezza has been going on actively.

ADYMNTUIrEs OF A MORMON SNTTL= (From the Lceds Aercu-y.) Six years ago a gentleman holding a responsible and Inra. tive situation on the Miailaud ailway voluntarily resigned office, against the earnest advice of a directory who valned his services, andafter disposing of houses and other property in Leeds set out with his wife and family on the long ocean and land journey to the Salt Lake, Utah, in company with a large namber of Mormon settlers Six years' experience brought to a sensitive and intellipat mind a thorough dis. gustof the Mormons and of their doctrines and ceremonies Before poUution had reached the bosom of his own family be resolved to hazard evarything *nd beat a retreat. The diffliculties of an escape, even from the wicked socne itself, re many, to say nothing of the perils of the overland journey. Money was sent from England; fortunately, in this instance, it arrived in afe hands, eluding the grasp of the Mormon chiefs-fiends of the worst description. The journey was commenced, and the following extract gives a fear ful picture of the dangers with which it was attended:- " St. Louis, United States, Nov. 11, 1856. "Mfy dear Brother,-I know it will be joyftil news for you to learn that we have all arrived here in safety. Has not the kind providence of Almighty God watched over ul in an especial manner? I left England, now nearly six years ago, with five children, and encountered innumerable rils by sea, rivers, and land, and not only have all the nve children, as weU as my dear wife and I been mercifully spared to return to and arrive in a civilized country, but we have two more children who were born in the monntains, and who are spared to remind us of our banishment, as it were, or rather transportation from everything we held dear, and that wa calculated to smooth the rugged path of life. It is true this penanoe was self-imposed; but I have confidence that He in whose hands we are, and who leads His children by a way which they know not, will overrule even this affliction, not only for our good, but for the good of all connected with us. That we are His children lam confident ; His marvellous loving-kindness and watchful care He has exercised over us abundantly provo it, and Iam determined to trust in Him. " Your prayers have been answered. We have seen perilons tines since I wrote to you from Fort Loramie on the 9th of September. We started from there on the morning of pthe 10th, the company coDsiSting of three waggons, with eightmen, three women, and16 children-only mutering three guns and a worthless pistol among us. We travelled 5ive days and a-half, making about 125 miles in the time, when wve nit a train of seven waggons with goods for Salt Lake, The drivers told us that the Chegenne Indians, a very savage tribe, were on the road, kiling al the whites they could find traveUing in smal companes or otherw derenoeless, and commnitting al kinds of depredations; that they had kdlled AlmonW. Babitt,theUnitedStates'Secretary for Utah, on his way from W shington home, s also two maen who were travelling with him-viz, Thomas Sutherland, once a clerk in the Bank of Ireland Dubln and with whom I waz particularly intimate (he, lkemyself havin changed his views with reprd toMormonism, ad intendin6 to remove his family as soon as circumstances would permit), and another man whose name wa Nowlaud Wealso learned that they had killed two men named lhomas Margettg and - Cowdy, with their wives, an& Cowdy's child. These families started fromal7t LAkethree or four days before us, avin% g joined in the purchase of a light waggon with mules and horses "I saw Cowdy the day before they *arted grinding coffee for the journey, he and Margett' regretting that my means would not allowme to purchase a horse-team, so that I could travel along with them. They met with a family (or overtook them) travelUing from California to the States, with a horse-team, and the two waggons kept companions together until the Indians pounced upon them. This family consisted of a man and his wife and infant, with a young single man as passenger, who happened to be out at the time huntig baufalo, and who finally escaped to Fort Kearney. The Indians took the poor infant by its feet and dashed its brains out against the ground, after having killed its parents. " They had also attacked the waggons we had just met in the dead of the night, but all the drivers except one (who was killed) managed to escape to Kearney; a woman, who was travelling with them, having been either killed or taken psonerT lhey found blood, however, in the waggon (which we saw), but no traces of her body. 'And we were travellingunconcernedly, because unaware of our imminent peril, right into the very thick of the danger; and, had we not Providentisir met our informants tSo or three days would most probably havebrought us t the end of our Journey through life. Perhaps the fiends might have spared the lives of some of our children for purps much worse than death to them I tremble to think of it, and so will you; but your emotions and mine are mixed with unfeigned gratitude to our Heavenly Father for tie wonderful preserving care which He exercised towards us. "After consultation, we concluded that our couTse was to turn back to Loraine in company with the seven waggons, and claim protection from the United States' force at Loramie. We accordingly did so, and it took us seven days to go over the same ground we had previously done in five days and a-half. When we arrived at Loramie we found seven waggons, with families removing from Salt Lake, pretty much under the same circumstances as we were. They had heard of the hostility of the Chegenne Indians through a friendly Indian of the Sioux tribe, who brought the news to Fort Loramie, and they were waiting for an opportunity to proceed in safety. This Indian came up to our lttle camp on the second or third night after we had left Fort Loramie on the 10th of September, and staIel with us all night. He told them on his arrival at the fort throngh an interpreter that he had tried to make us aware of our danger, but was unable, because of our utter ignorance of one word of his language. He certainly did try to makeus understand something of importance, but it was all Gree} to us? and worse. We sang round the fire-I think it was' Christians, awake,' and tried severa; times to inducs him to sing in the uncouth manner of his nation, but he invaribly shook his head and ighed, we little knew why at that time, but were enabled to interpret all some few days afterwards. "On our arrival at the fort, the commanding offlicer (Colonel HoffmLn) told us that we had acted wisely in turning back; that the Indian in question (' Black--Heart's' son) had come a-head of a company of United States Dragoons, who vere escorting some Indians (prisoners) home that had been taken in the war with the Sioux tribe lst year, Black. Heart's son being of the number, but when within a few dayse journey of his tribe he had pushed on alone. "It appears that in the treaty of peace with the General Government, it was stipulated that the p)risoners should be escorted from Fort leavensworth, where they were confined, through the country belonging to other tribes, who were their enemies, to Fort Loramie, in their own country, and this was being carried into effect. Colonel Hoffman told us that the said Dragoons would be in in a few days, and would have to return almost immediately to Leavenaworth, andathat they would accommodate their speedto ours, if we would stretch out all we could and travd with us for our protection. We accordin4ly waited, and everything turned out as the colonel anticipated. It was the st Regiment of United States cavalry, under Captain Stuart, a perfect gentlemns. He behaved very kindly, often reUeving the necessities of some of our company who were destitute, and when we came to Ash Hollow, where there is a mountain to ascend nearly as steep as a house side, he ordered his men to dismount and assist us up with ropes, and even, hikerally, put his own shoulder to the wheels The troops travelled with us about 450 miles, warded off the Indians, and broughtus through alldan2eron that score. They then went on ahead tho remaining 160 miles, and beat u by two days to Leavensworth. 'This turning back 125 miles gave us 250 miles extra journey, and was very expensive to me, I having to purchase provisionsat Tery high prices; 15c. or 7d. per lb. r iour and hardbread, and so on in proportion,u nded to impoverish my means for the further prosecution of my journey.'

COUNTY CODRTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I proceedto trace te history of the Connty Courts, in order that, having asoertained preeent inoonsistencies; i we mAy discover Lor to renmove them. InAugus, 1850, as we have seen, the jurisdiction of the new tribunals was extended from 201. to 50L The conoew - %ion, destructive even of the sembl,nce of Small Debts Courts, was made solely bocause the current of popuar opl3nion had become so powerful that it could not safely be resisted. I do not pause to inquire whother this conoesion was a wine one. It is suAicient for my purpose to point out that, having once been made, it cannot be recalled, and that it involves the neceidty of a complete revision of existing relationships between our saperior and inferior civil tribunals. Even the 50 Emit, hoavever, was not large enough for Young England. The innovators arted that, if both the litigants were not unwilling that claims exceeding 50,, or questions of title, &c., should be tried in the County Court, they ought to be permitted to hAve their own wilful and wicked way, and to settle their disputes in that tribunal to which they vTere both desirous of resorting. The proposition was one not eily conteted,; and Westminster yielded to it with prudenoe, if not alacrity. But so skilfauy was the enactment framed that in practice it was nugatory. .To confer extraordinary jurisdiction on the County Courts it ws required that a memorandum should be drawn up for that purpose and signed by both patest or their attorneys prior to the commenoement of the actiorn As a matter of general se such an arragement must necesarily be impractcable. The interests of the legal advisers were clearly opposd to it. Even supposing each litigant equally impressed with the justice of his o n cause (a suppogition manifestly extavaput), he is little lkely in most cvil cases to obey the Scripture precept and to "agree with his adversuy quickly, whilst he is ix the way with him." " To require the active consent of both parties" to " such v previous arrangement i, in my judgment," sys Mfr. Pitt Taylor, one of the commisioners, "a n objoet that cannot be attained; and all that can reasonably be expected or requiredis that the County Court should not have jurisdiction unless the parties passively eonsent." Experienoe has proved the jugticeof the above concla sion The experiment "has been tried now for nearly five years (more than five), and has proved an utter failure." Let me add that a somewhat similar experiment in the superior oourts has been equally unsuocessful, and this, too, with advantages of no ordinary description. By the lst Common LAw Procedure Act, 1854, the parties to any cause may, by consent in writing signed by them or their attorneys, leave the deCsion of any issnue of fact to the court instead of a jury. The judgeg of the superior courts are, as they deserve tobe, highlyreepected. The current of popular favour is undoubtodly aEainrt juries In civil caes3, and in favour of doecions by a single educated mind. Yet in what minimum percentage of caes has this permission been acted upon? The mans of mankind are in truth followers, not of tho exception, but of the rule in praticeE; nor arelitigauts more disposed than other men to revive the age of chivalry. Having violated the principle of Small Debts Courts by the expansion of the jurisdiction for 20. to 60L-having protected Westminster and, let me add, the public interests by the right of appeal-having given further jurisdiction to the inferior Court by what was termed "oonsent," and then nullified that provision by insisting that consent should be active, in its other proceodings the legislature has been equally unsteady, and, now drulnk with new wine from the caAk, and now decanting new wine into old bottles, has reeled to and fro with mrost consistent incondsstency. Contract and tort are placed on the -ame footing with respect to the right of removal of actions into the superlor courts, and the widom of 1849 and 1856 has in this respoct sanctioued the deision of 1847. Contraot and tort are yet so different that an action in which 51 is recovered in the latter presents equal dificulties with an ction for 201. in the former shape, and in this respect, too, we adhere to the wisdom of our predecessors. County Courta in 1846 oonld not ofely be trud to try claims exceeding 201., and were incompetent to deal with questions of title; yet, at the very same time, in actions of replevin in cases of distress for rent in assesr, or damage fcasnf, brought before them, they had jurisdiction to decide all questions of title, and were not limited to any amount. In 1850 their competency, guaranteed by the right of appeal, had increased in tho ratio of 20 to 50, and had not reached generally beyond 501.; but in tho cases last enumerated (certainlyrnot the easiest to deal with) their intelligence was unlimited, and no appeal was desirable, even where title was in question. In 1856 the samo limit of general competency and the same unlimited competency as to amount is oontinued in the clas of cases above-mentioned, but the right of appeal has been accorded, and legisltorisi consistency vindicated! Eight years ago title (except in replevin) could only be tried by such a memorandum of arangement as Ihave above described. Now, when title shall incidentally some in question the judge may, subject to the right of appeal, and for the purposes of the action before him, decide the claim which it Is the immediate object of the action to enforce, but both parties, at the hearing (not prior to it), must consent in writing ,to such jurisdiction. A similar oonsent will now givo jurisdiction in AU actions except those for criminal conversation; but a plaintiff complaining of a malicious prosecution must stMil obtain the consent, in writing, of his adversary to try his case before the same tribunal which may, without such consent, try an action for false imprisonment; and this though the distinction is expressly repudiated by the Commisioners in their late report. In 1846 the Court which conld not try ejectment, and which, in an ordinary action of debt had then but a 201. competency, might yet determine the right of a landlord to recover possession of his promises where the rent or valus did not excoed 50L .aear nd no fine had been paid, and this, too, without appeal (properly so calUed), thoung the questions involved were frequently of the nicest intricacy. In 1850, the general competency having increased in the ratio above mentioned, buttherightof appealbeing granted (really with reference to amount), the original powers for gpmting possesaion of premises remained unaltered; and, finuly, in 1856, when many new poowers have been meantime accorded, the right of appeal is given in this as in other cases, a claim for rent or mesne profits not exceeding 501 may be added in the plaint, but the jurisdiction is limited to oass where neither the value of the premises nor the rent payable in respect thereof shall have exceeded 501. a-year, &e. The validity of a devise, bequest, or limitation under any wiU or settlement, however small the amount in question, cannot yrt be tried by a County Court, unless by the active consent of an adversary, whose very position renders it an absurdity to expect that he will give it. In interpleader (subject now to the right of appeal) the same validity is permitted to be-and is, in fact-daily determined. Bet it is useless further to multiply instances of anomaly and inconsistency in the direct dealings of Parliament with the County Courts. Other enactments, however, have assigned to the County Courts a position and duties utterly at variance both with their original character of Small Debts Courts and with the more extensive, but still limited jurisdiction of 50l. granted to them in 1S50. If in referring tothese duties I fall ito Any error, it will be only because they are so various and so complicatod tbat I believe there is no County Court Judge in England who could, "off book" (if in these Christmas times such a phrae is permitted), enumerate above ono-half of them. To expect him to do it "by heart" would be a manifest cruelty. Is there no inference which may be drawn from this incompetency? But to proed-. Within year after the first establishment of the County Courts, and, of course, while they were stil limited to claimg of 201., and could not by any arrangement try title, an act passed by which, where expenses had been incurred under certain circumstances in the removal of nuisanes, they might be sued for to any amount in the County Courts, and questions of title, sure in asch actions to aise, might be decided finally. This provision remains unaltered, In 1853, by the Customs Act, the Crown ws permitted to sue in the County Courts for duties or penalties not exeedting in any case 1001., and the decision of the judge was final. This, too, so far as I can discover, remains unaltered, even including the absence of the right of appeal, though the Commniimoners have very properly recommendod that suh right should be given. Why the Crown may sue the subject for 101, and one subject can sue another for only 501., I leave the wise to determine. In 1854 it was provided that questions of acount ";whioh cannot conveniently be tried in the ordinary way," might be sent down from the superior to the inferior courts, and disposed of in the latter, without limitation as to amount, That isto say, when it is troublesome to a judge of the superior courts (who may not be a good aoountant) to try a ca of account with many disputed items, though he has the asistance of a jury of mercantile men acustomed to suh inquiries, he may remit the trouble to the judge of an Inferlorcour, wbo has at leat as much on his hands as his superior, who may be a worse aocountant, and has no such merantUe ooadiutor ! By the PA of the prese t year actions of contract, whera mot more than 50L i involved, mcy be remitted fom tho superior to the inferior courts for the purposce of tr4 not for praotito in bookketeptng. The inquiries, however, which any come before & County Court judge are *5 various in character as they are unoertain in amount of claim. Though the wronged and unfortunate legatee for 10. oc 20 is excluded from the only tribunal to wbich his meant permit him to resort, if the smallest particle of a * trust " mingle with the duties of the executor, because the County Court is a court of common law, and should bo kept to its proper sphere of duties; yet, under the Suocsion Dutios Act, 1853, appoals against the ossument of the Commissioners, to an amount not exoeeding 60L, may be heard and determined by the judp of the County Court, whose de. chon is finaL. "It is evident," say the County Court Commissioners in their report, " that difficult questions of equity, ns well as law, may ariso in the determination of the appeal," and " thxt a fxr grcater sm than 504 may become the subject of inquiry in the County Court." BY the Charitable Trusts Act, 15, whoro equitable relief is required, and the gross annuil inoome of tbo charity does not exceed 30D., jurisdiction, subject to a right ot appeal, is given to the County Courts.

THE COST OF COZNVIOT& TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am a Dorsetshire labourer, and last night I was down in our vilage, and saw your paper of the 3d, for though we are poor villagers there are precious few of us, I can tell you, that do not, now and then, get a look at The Time.s On the 6th page is a letter about tho cost of convncts, and it is that that makes me write to you A good gentlemax of our parish has written over my letter for me and mended the spelling and the granmar. I wanted him to write himnself, but ho says he won't. Well, Sir, the letter says that a convict at Pentonvillo Prison is allowed for 15 months' living 2131b. of beef, 2481b. of mutton 81b of thins of beef for soup, and plenty of other good things and, as if that were *hort commons, ho has 655 mutton chops and 432 pints of porter for extra allowance. Now, Sir, I am a farmer's labourer, and 'work hard six days a-week, 12 hours a-day, and have a wife and five children to support, houserent and firing to pay for, and no allowance or privilege whatever, and my wages are 12s. a- week. We can never taste either beef or mutton, and do not get a pint of beer from year's end to year's end. I hoVe I am honost and industrious, and I don't think any nuan mi the prh wonld give me a bad word. I do not complain of my lot, for many of my neighbours are no better off than myself, and I never was a burden to an-boda But we had a man in our parish called Loim Skinner, a regular idle, good-for-nothing chap. He took to poachin, and got put to gaol for it, and then, after he camo out, he got thieving; and so from bad to worse, till he was tried at the asizes for housebreaking, was found guilty, and is now, they tell me, at Pentonvie Prison, Now, Sir, I ask you, is this fair play? Here am T, honest and hardworking, keeping a wife and family on 3114 16s. a- year, and there is Tom, in gaol, allowed almost as much for meat and drink I I can't know the taste of beef or mutton, and here is he with 5511b. in 15 nmonths and 656 mutton chops extra I IcAn hardly get a pint of beer, but Tom has 432 pints, besides barley water, at toe public expense. I am told that prisoners want all this. Why, Sir, I want it too, but then I don't getit - and my neighbours don't get it; and if we can't get it by honest labour why should he by thieving? Some tell me that they feed up these fellows in order to reform them. I ean't say I have much faith in these reformings. I never saw a goal bird yet that wasn't a sght worse for going there But any how " prevention is better than cure " and in my belief letting our folks hereabout know that by catching a few birds, or trapping a hare, or stesling a roost, may be, or any other tricks of that kind, they may be feasted with beet and porter, and plenty of mutton chops extra, is a bad way to prevent crime. I don't want to bear hard upon prisoners God forbid! I know what hunger is myself too well to wish anybody else to feel it. Btt what I say is, let such fellows live no better than we are forced to, or than they would have been if they had been honest labourers like we are. Give them potatoes, oatmeal, coarse bread, and a bit of bacon oneo now and then. That's how we live, and I would wish nobody to live worse; but to have thieves and vagabonds fed at the public expense on plenty of beef and porter and other good things, while many like me can hardly with honest labour keep the wolf from the door. is verv erievon. to Sherborno, Jan. 5.

PEBUVrIN1 GUARO. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-From a circular issued by Messrs. Gibbs, dated December 24, 1&G, I am informed that on that day the price of Peruvian guano advanced 21. per ton. In looking over the statistics of imDports into the united kingdom, f observe that in 1855 30 ,061 tons of guano were iniported, probably, nine-tenths of which passed through the hands of the firm enjoying the monopoly of the Peruvian trade. The increased charge of, say, 600,0001. upon an article exclusively used by the corn producers of this country in the face of failing grain-markets calia for the serious consideration of every prudent cultivator of the soil. Last season I purchased 30 tons for the use of myself and tenants at 1lU. per ton. I am now asked to give 13L forthe same quantity; shouldI require only 29 tons I should have to pay 14 5g 1;rton, 30 tons being conaidered a wholese purchame o cause is aleged for the increed cost of the article. The eircular is silent as to harder terms on the part of the Peruvian Government, or exactions from the stipowners. The trade reports of 1856, in your columns of January 3, describe freights to be more easy; " We cannot hide from oureelves that we have too uch tonnage afloat for the purposes of IiLitimato trade. " rC It may be true that the stock of guano Is lolw for the period of the year, but is that a reason for a inonoplist to, give that tbe price should be raised? The purchsers of guano have a tight to ask the cause of an increas in theo price. Should the Peruvian Government have unwisely hazarded their securities by crippling the guano trade, the farmers may have A wrord of advice to give to the Eniglish holders of Pleruvian bonds; on the other hand, if the irepore -with lowered freights, and in the face of droo inporain, markets, desire unduly to enrich themselves at ggexpense of British farmers, they may be taught a lessor noo alto. getber unknown to other short-sighted traders, that even monopoly cannot stand against protective combination exercied in a just cause. hie evil, if permitted to sucoeed, may be exaected to in. fluence the price of other manuree by disturbing the cur rent of the manure trade.

COURT OP BANKRUPTCY, Bawng7aZl-.jret, Jan. 8. IN RE TUE R,OYAL BRITISH BANK. (BcforeS Mr. Commi&sioncr HOLROS D.) ±A0S was a meeting for the proof of debts. Mr. Joseph Brown, instructed by Mtr. L,iiiklater, appeared for the assignees. Mr. MELLISIH (instructed by Mlr. Field), said, he appeared for a number of the new sharhlsolders, who now sought to prove against the estate of the baok for the amount, on the ground that they had been induced to take those shares by fraud. The fraud being established, they would be clearly entitled to repudiate those shares. There was no doubt that money got by fraud could be recovered as money had and received, and be must contend that his clients were entitled to recover in case of bankruptcy. The bank was founded by charter in September, 1849. By that charter the capital was to be 100,0001., ii 1.000 shares of 1001. each. INot one of the persons lie reprcsented held one of those ori-itial shares. They held shares issued subsequently totbe new charter, bearing date the 23d of February, 1855. Prior to that tiuie it was quite clear that the directors had no poNver to ralse more capital. The consent of the Cro wn was clearly requit ed, and it was not certain even that the Crown possessed the power to give it to them. The 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 113. contained provisions which prohibited the raising of additional capital, except nutder conditions and circunistances there set forth-such as that previous capial should have been paid up and the deed of partnership of the cumnpany have been signed by all the shareholders. When the iiew charter was obtained in February, 1855, these requirements had not been duly conupYQ?d'with. Ten per cent. had not been paid at the time and in the manner there specified, and the question arose whether the new shar,holders had ever been shareholders at alL Unfortunately, the new Ehareholders knew very little of the position of the bank that the public did not know by nieans of the newspapers and the statement of Mr. Coleman. He proposed to call Mr. Coleiiian to prove certain facts. The books of the bank were also relied on. Mlr. Colen,an's evidence, in fa,t, could, as it were, be only an index to the evidence which the books theusselves supplied. He proposed to read a number of affidavits made by new shareholders in support of their right to prove against the estate. Mr. BROWVN said, the case involved proofs to the amount of CO,OOOI. or 80,0001. The Court would not proceed upon general affidavits. One of the new shareholders might have right of proof ; another might not. The case of every new shareholder might be distinct, and the shareholder ought, as in other cases, to attend personaUy and give his evidence in support of his individual claim. Mr. XELLISH proposed to take the case of Mr. Edwin Booth, surgeon, and to put in the affidavit he held in his hand. The CozmiiliSoNEs said the case must be taken as at Nisi Pn-is, and the affidavit of Mr. Booth was not pub in evidence. Mr. MELLISHI said there were two sorts of misrepresentation to new shareholders upon which reliance might be made-misrepresentation at the time of taking the shares, or that the directors had published to the world false representations and false statements in reference to the affairs and position of the bank, with the intent to get money from the new shareholders. If lio should prove that misrepresentations were made to the world to induce them to take shares, and that the shares had been taken in consequence of those representations, his clients -would have a clear right of proof. So, also, if fictitious dividends had been declared, and the directors knew at the time those dividends were paid that they were not paid out of capital, but out of deposits, that would be sufficient evidence of fraud. Mr. Booth kept a drawing account at the Strand branch of the bank. He perused from time to time the reports of the bank, particularly one of December, 1854, in which mention was made of a sum of upwards of SOO,OOOI., and the prosperous position of the bank described. In March, 1855, hMr. Booth called one day at the Strand branob, when the manager strongly recommended him to purchase some shares,and pointed out the peculiar advantages of the bank, and in the same month the directors of the l ank sent out a circular in which it was stated that thev had the pleasure to inform their shareholders and customeis that a supplemental charter had been granted authorizing theratoinrease the capitalof the bank 500,0001. ,and that they had decided to increase it accordiiigly. 100,0001. new capital had been already raised, and a further sum was proposed to he raised. Customers of the bank would have a preference in the allotment of shares. Reference was made in the circular to other joint-stock banks having divided 14 per cent. and doubled their capital, and it was set forth that the Royal British Bank had been equally successful if allowance were made for the short time during which it bad been in existence. These representatious were false and fraudulent. The Brihtsh Bank had divided 6 per cent., and that dividend had been paid out of capitaL In fact, at the time these representaions were niade it would be shown that the bank had lost al its capital. At " the corresponding periods of their existence," it could not be stated that other joint-stock banks paying 14 psr cent. were in this position. There had clearly been fraudulent representations in the circular. A " reserve fund" had also been mentioned, but it would be shown that no such " reserve fand" was in existence. One director at that time had drawn upon the bank to the amount of about 40,0001. ; the manager had drawn a large amount ; another director and the chairiisan had done the same. Those sums far exceeded the capital of the bank. These debts were represented as available assets, as also were mines in Wales. But they were really not so. On the contrary, at the time this circular was issued the bank had lost such large sums that it was inpossible for it to go on, and the supplemezntal charter, with its powers and consequences, was a scheme on the part of the manager and directors to carry it on by means of new capital-that capital being the money of now shareholders. Whether one director was more guilty than another, the scheme was a fraudulent one-one to replace money that had beeu lost out of the pockets of others. To eflect the object it was necessary to disguise the position of the hank, and the disguise was practised. The affidavit of Mr. Booth showed that it was not until the 17th of March, 1855, that he paid 601. on account of his six shares, which payment was subsequently increased to 3001. when ho signed the " supplemental" deed of the comnpany. On the 3d of September, 1856, the bank suspended payment, and they all now knew its position. Mr. Booth made oath that she knew nothing of the falsity of the bank's statements until its stoppage. The bank had continued to pay false dividends and to sell shares, and if it could be shown that Mr. Booth had received any dividend the amount would have to be deducted from his claim. Mr. Booth unfortunately could not fully prove the falsity of the bank's statements-that could be only sufficiently proved by its officers. He had hoped that the directors themselves would lie examined before Mr. Booth; but, as this could not be arranged, he proposed to call Mlr. Colemanl. It was possible that the directors had given up the management of the bank to two or three of their body; but that would not make any difference. If they chose to delegate their authority to even one director, they were liable for the fraudulent conduct that one director practised, and his clients could recover. It was impossible that the directors could have been ignorant of the position of affairs. Mr. Mellish proceeded to cite " Burns v. Pennell," of House of Lords Reports, p. 497 and 523, vol. ii., ii support of his case. That case nad been decided by the House of Lords in favour of the company (the Forth Marine Insurance Cotnpany), the false representations havimig been made by a writer whoh .was held not to have been actiiig within the scope of Isis authority for the directors; but Lord Canipbell had made use of the following remarks:- We now come, then, to the allegations respecting the acts of the directors themselves; and if the plaintiff has been deceived and defrauded by theni, and induced by them to purchase the shares by their false representations, the interlocutor must be reversed. I donot think it necessary, even,that the representations should have beenimade personally to him, if the directors have niade false representations for the purpose of fictitiously enhancing the price of shares for their own beefit, and the appellant has thereby been deceived an induced to purchase shares greatly beyond their value, the transfer of the shares, although cxecuted, ought to be Eet aside. But, the transfer having been executed, a clear and strong case of fraud ought to be established ; and it must be shown that the purchaser of these shares was induced to purchase them by the deceit of the director." Lord Broughani also said,-" After the contract is executed it would require a great deal more stringent proof of fraud, dolus dans loeumn consrachti, to set the contract itself aside, than would be required to prevent its specific performance if the matter had rested in fir-i, and had been executory merely. That was very distinctly stated in a celebrated case in this House, celebrated on account of the length of the litigation and its importance, and also on account of the position of the parties-miamely, 'H arris v. Kemble' (2 Dow. and Clk., 463), which was heard by Lord Plunkett, Lord Eldon, and myself: in that case that principle was very fully illustrated. But it isamatter beyond aldcubt, and requiringno furtber argument or consideration. But here was a contract executed, Mr. Burns had purchased the shares, and he resists the calls made upon him by force of that contract. Under these circumstances it would require a very strong case of fraud; it would require not merely a general averment that there had been irregular conduct on the part of the directors-not only a general averment that they had behaved trickily (if I may so speak), but there must be legal fraid, it aitist be dotes dsnss locumr contractLi. It is not enough for a man to say ' If you had not given such an appearance of the flourishing state of a ffa ir s -if y o u t h a n o b y ptally aitn g odi v iden d s o ult o f c a p ita l (making p tb pubicvbelieve th at yon wpearae pyin them out of roit),gienths fouisin aperace to th concer by ourownact asd eed, Isholdnever have bought ..:ll'YS'te -tbat, I say, i-snot enough-.

That is the language of the civil law, which aU nations have followed, and the general principles of whib, in all iibattefr of personal contract, constitute the law of all Euirope at this momient." Mr. Mellish said he should sbov the rtind of fraud referred oe by Lord Campbell. This done, the proofs would be admitted by this Court., After seoie discussion, diring which it appeared that k r. Booth was unable to attend to-day to give evidence, another new shareholder was calledwe mr. Williami Nelson depoised that he is a clerk, residing in Canterbury-road. Hd bad kept an account at the Rhyat British Bank sisice March, 18o55 He first saw the reports of the bank just before he opened a deposit account. .He asked for those reports, aid they were given to hien. 3-fe attended ems one occasion a meetig sof the bank, and Mr Cameron, its manager, put a copy oif the report into Isis hands. He openedi the account at the bank with a. view to take somneof the new sharei. T*hesusbect of takingthwee shares was first menitioned to hiiiis byXir.Davenport, a ,clerkcin the samneoffice with ,"dmself. The eircular and reports mere the cause of his taking the shares. 'The parti1culatr .rmicnla,-to which be referred had been forw2z"d to his ~tftm. M,L',LLIssri said lie could not at the presen womenit prodzioe tL circular, and he contended that another, ite. com'y (if it m1,.ight he given in evidence. AL2- &_*jy_r objected. Thie strictest proof muda ik quired in all cases of the kind. There were mianr new sbare. holders who would gladly seek to show that they had been induced to take their shares as Mr. Nelson did. Shareholders who had never seen reports or ciroulars at all would say they had done so. The identical circular or report tbat contained the misstatement relied on mnust be produced. The CosxMmsi0oNl said it was necessary as the case stood that the new shareholders should make out a Strong and clear cace of fraud. Mr. Nelson said he had " pinned" the circular and sent it to his solicitors, Messrs. Sharp, Field, and Jackson. 'Mr. BROWN insisted upon his right to the identical circular and report a case very often turned upon that. Mr. Nelson.-The circular produced was a copy of the one he forwarded to Messrs. Sharp, Field, and Jackson. He received it from a friend, Mr. Davenport Mtr. BROWN said he must require the directors to be shoNvn to have been connected with this circular. This was the first case of the kind in which a debt had been sought to be proved by a shareholder against a joint-stock c.ompany. Thlestrictest rules in regard to right of proof must be required. It was not sufficient to produce a printed circular of the company and expect the Court to act upon it. 'Jr. Nelson's examination continued.-It was in Marcb, 185.5, that he applied for the shares. He got the printed form of application for them from Mr. Davenport, which he signed and delivered at the Strand branch of the bank. Mlr. InowN suggested that the proceedings in this caso should be conducted the same as in an action of an allottee of shares. This Court would not lend any assistance to establish these proofs. If established, not only would the shareholders recover their 60,000. or 80,0001., they would also be relieved from their calls. The ComlIssio.;ER suggested that every book and document possessed by the bank should be open to the inspection of Mr. Mellish's chents, in order that the evidence relied upon by both parties might be fairly before him. Mr. LINKLATER said he had already offered to take this course, subject to his Honour's approval. The CoamsussioNs.R. said that, if Mr. Field were allowed the opportunity of examining any of the company's books he pleased, it might turn out that no fraud had been practised upon an individual, but that fraud had been practised upon a body. If there should be no individual fraud the case was one of equity, and it bad been already decided that an individual could not recover where a body had been defrauded. It might turn out that no one individtal could say he was defrauded, but that a number of individuals had been defrauded, in which case the individual could not sue for himself only. If they were only able to prove general allegations of fraud they were unable to recover. Specific fraud must be established. A desultory conversation took place touching the right of Mr. Field to inspect every book and paper of the bank. Mir. Mellish contended that he had a right to see the whole; Mr. Brown that Mr. Mellish must say what information was required, and that he could not be allowed to go into a voyage of discovery. Whatever might be required to show that the reports and circulars of the directors were false they might inspect, but not more. Mr. Field might rely that nothing would be withheld that ought to be given. Mr. ~iellish said he was entitled to inspect everything. The Co.mXIssIoNEB1 thought the best course was for Mr. Field to commence the inspection. When he came to a stop he might apply to the Court, whick would decide whether he had a right to the information. Mr. Nelson, further examined, produced the certificate which he got from the bank for his shares. The money was paid in April, 1855. He did not fully pay for the shares until he had attended a meeting at which some of the directors were present, and at which meeting he got one of their reporta. The certificate was dated August, 1855. The report was read at the meeting referred to. A discussion next arose, whether Mr, Coleman should be examined. MIr. Reed objected. 31r. Coleman was engaged in preparing balance-sheets for some of the directors, and he objected to his being called to prove a case against them. Mr. LINKLATER said the clerks in the bank could perhaps furnish some of the information required, but they were engaged in assisting the oflicial managers, and not the assignees. The assignees were unable to give that information Mr. Field required. What was it that Mr. Field really required ? Mr. Field.-AII I want to ascertain is whether the balance sheets of the bank were lies or not, This cannot be ascertained from the directors themselves, who are not to be found. Mfr. LiNicLATEt said le had no wish to screen the directors; on the contrary, it would be his duty to subject them to an ordeaL It was, however, but right to state that Mr. Alderman Kennedy had been here that morning, and was ready not only in person but in purse. He had paid a large sum very recently, and if other directors and shareholders had come forward as he had done the debts of the bank might have been paid. Mr. Field-Where is Mr. Cameron? Where is Mr. MacGregor? I want to know this. After some further discussion Mr. LiNKLATER said Ur. Field was quite welcome to go into the vaults of the bank, inspect any documents,andremain till he was ready to come back again. (A laugh.) fhiS HOIsOUR ulhtmately adjourned the inquiry to this day week to afford an opportunity for examination, remark. ing that if one case should be established there might be no difficulty in ascertaining whether it did not apply to a number of others.

CENTBAL CRITUINAIL COURT, Jatn. 8. OLD COURT. (Before Mr. Baron MArTLrN and Arr. Justice WILLES.) John Compton, 23, a genteel-looking young man, who was described as a shoemiaker, but who, it appeared, was a constable in the D division of police, was inidicted for a burglary in the dwellinghouse of John Lee Benham, and stealing money to the amount of 361., his property. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clerk conducted tbe prosecution on behalf of the Treasury; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Sleigh. The learned counsel for the prosecution,in opening the case to the jury, said he was sure that when they had heard the circumstances connected with the charge they would feel that it was one of great importance to the interests of society, and deeply involved the security of the public. The prisoner was charged with the crime of burglary, and at the time of the commission of the offence he had been for some years a constable belongiNg to the police force, and he was charged with having violated the sanctity of that property which it was his duty to protect. The learned counsel then briefly narrated the circumstances he proposed to put in evdence, and said that, although the evicence vas entirely circumstantial, it would be for the jury to say, as men of the world and men of common sense, when they looked at all the facts and considered the extraordinary conduct of the prisoner after the robbery had been committed, whether there could be any reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the crime with which he was charged. The following evidence was then adduced *- hlr. John Lee Benham deposed that he carried on the business of an ironmonger with two partners in Wigmorestreet, and a portion of the premises was in Welbeck-street. In December last he was about to have a bouse in Welbeekstreet thrown into his premises, and labourers were engaged for that purpose on the 10th of December, and a communication had been opened between the new house and the preinises that were occupied by witness. Witness and his family and servant5 went to bed about 11 o'clock at night on the 10th of December, and the premises were all at that time properly secured. About 4 o'clock on the following mornimg he was awoke by a ringing at his bell, and he looked out of the window and saw a policeman, who turned out to be the prisoner, and on his going down stairs he found the Welbeck-street door open, and the prisoner was standing outside in his uniform. As he was going down stairs he heard the prisoner esay to another policeman,who was vithbhim, "Don t leave, or l'u report you." Witness and the prisoner then went down to the basement, and found a basket belonging to one of the workmen on the floor, and he took possession of it, and the prisoner carried the basket and went up an unfinished staircase, which rather excited witness's suspicion. This staircase communicated with the new premises in Welbeck-street. Witness and the prisoner looked over the house, but he did not at tbat time discover that anything had been stolen, and he made an observation to that effect to the prisoner, and he was about to show the prisoner out, when he suggested that they should look in a small counting-house, where there was a desk that belonged to his son. Upon examining this desk it had evidently been disturbed, but as witness was not at that time aware that any money vas kept in it he repeated that nothing was gone, and the prlsoner then caUed his attention to a drawer that had evidently been broken open, and the bolt of the locek forced back, The prisoner then went into another counting-house, and caUed witne,,'s attention to a drawer that had been forced open, and also to two empty portemonnaies that were lying on a chair. Witness did not direct the prisoner to any of the places that he examined, but he went to them of his own accord. Witness thought at this time that a small sum of money only had been taken from the drawers, and he went with the prisoner to the door, where the other policeman was waitmg, and they went away. He afterwards ascertained that the premises bad been entered by a window that abutted upon a mews at the back of Welbeck-street. Cross-examined.-Witness had occasion to have his premises watehed by a policeman about four months before this ocourrence. There were from 10 to a dozen persons emploged on the works on the 10th of December. When the prisoner examined the premises he appeared rather more familiar with them than witness liked. (A laugh.) ldr. James Benham, the son of the last witness, proved that on the night of the robbery he had some money in the desk mentioned by the last witness, and on the following mornig he missed the money fromthat desk. The amount that was taken from the place was about ten guineasin gold and silver. Mr. Frederick Benham, another son of the prosecutor, proved that he also lost about 41. in gold and silver. Some money belonging to other persons was also taken; the whole, conisisting of gold and silver, amounting altogether to about 361. One of the shillings that was taken appeared to have borne some marks by which the owner was enabled to recognize it. WiDiam Hall a police-constable of the D division, said that his beat on this night was on one side of Welbeckstreet, and the prisoner's beat was on the other, and he had to go over Wigmore-street and down Marylebone-lane, and along Bentinek-street, and then along the west side of Welbeck-street, and on going back he would pass through the mews at the back of that street. is beat vould occupy 20 or 25 minutes in going over. The prisoner went on duty on the night of the robbery at 12 o clock, and witness saw him about half-past 12 in Welbeck-street, and the prisoner told him he had spent eighteen pence of his week's money which he had received the day before, and he said he had given his wife aU the rest, and that he had no money left. Witness saw the prisoner again about 1 o'clock in Little Welbeck-street, and he did not see him again until about a few minutes before 3, when he was in the same place. He had been round his own beat all the intermediate time, but he saw nothing of the prisoner. At 4 o'clock he saw the prisoner at Mr. Benham's shop, and he called his attention to the fact that the door was open, and he rang the bell, and the prisoner went on and witness remained outside, and no one could have left during that period without witness observing him. Cross-examined.-Witness gave in a report of his evidence to the inspector before he was examined by the magistrate, He also made areportto MIr. Hughes, the superintendent of the division, and informed him that the prisoner had told him on the night of the robbery that he had no money. Witness did not hear the prisoner threaten to report him if he went away while he was standing outside the door. Thomas Knight, a sergeant of the same division, said, on the morning of the 11th of December he was engaged in looking after the men on their beats, and he saw the prisoner about 1 o'clock, and he saw nothing more of him until a few minutes before 3, when he asked him for a penny for the widow of a late constable. The whole of the force usually subscribed a penny in such cases. The prisoner said he did not think he had a penny, but he afterwards pulled one from his coat pockets, and at the same time said he was not short of a shilling either, and he pulled out a pocketbook, and witness saw that it was ful1 of large silver. Witness observed that he had plenty of money, and the risoner asked him if he would have half-x-crown to drink ns health. Witness told him he Aid netl -f - , n- anadwas About to walk away, when the prisoner droppea half-a-crown into his pocket, and witness took it out and threw it on the pavement, and asked him why he took such a liberty with him as to put the money into his pocket, and be ought to report him for it ; he at the same time ordered the prisoner to leave his beat at 4 o'clock, and o to the station on reserve. He saw the prisoner at Mr. 3enham's house about 4 o'clock, with his lamp on, and he repeated his orders to go to the gtation, and be said he had found a door open, and witness ordered him to arouse the inmates and bring the report to him at the station as soon as he could. The risoner did not get to the station till just before 5 o'clocYc and he was in a very confused and excited state, and, in answer to inquiries witness made of him, he said that Mr. Benham's house had been entered, and that some drawers had been broken open, and also a cashbox. He was very confused, and appeared hardly able to stand; and witness took him before the inspector, to whom he repeated the statement he had made before. Witness was then about to leave the station, and the prisoner followed him. He went home, and about 9 o'clock, in consequence of some information he received, he went, in company with Inspector Mackrell, to the prisoner's lodging in LIattle Weymouth-atreet. He was not at home at the time, but he came in in about five minutes, and Mr. Maokrell told him that a burglary had been committed at Mr. Benham's, and that he was suspected, and that he had cometo search the lodgings. The prisoner said he had no money but what he worked hard for, and that he and his wife had had a severe quarrel, and that he took out all the money with him. The inspector was about to search him, when the prisoner pulled out the pocketbook 1 witness had seen during the night. There was then no silver in it, but the prisoner said it contained a 51.-note ness asked him what he had done with all the 6ilver he saw at 3 o'clock, and he said he had changed it for a 51.- and a note for that amount was found in it. Witnote at Mr. Carruthers' publichouse, in Bulstrode-street. Ten shilings in silver were found in the prisoner's trousers pocket, and witness saw Mr. Mackrell find three pawnbrokers' duplicates in the prisoner's room. The prisoner was then taken to the police-station, and remained in the inspector's room the whole of that day. On the following morning the prisoner was taken to the police-court, and as they were goig along he saw the wife of a constable looking out of a window, and he swung up his hands towards her and said, "All serene. old girl, I'll get over this all right." Witness said to him, "I Don't be too sanguine, Compton; there in more against you than you expect." He replied, "YoR have not found tbat gold, Knight; that licked you." The prisoner's pay was 18s. 7id. per week, and he also worked at hls trade as a shoemaker, but his duty as a policeman would not allow him to do much. The prisoner while on duty ought to be continually walking over his beat, and the whole distance would not take more than a-quarter of an hour to walk constantly. He joined the police force in 1852, and he was placed on this particular beat on the first Monday in November. Cross-examined.-The prisoner produced the book immediately upon the inspector telling him that he would search hin. He also stated of his own accord that he had obtained the 51.-note at Mr. Carruthers'. Witness was quite sure the prsoner made use of the exact expressions he had mentioned. He worked at his trade as a shoemaker all the time he was in the force. The prisoner's father was in the polce, and received a pension for good conduct. He had heard the prisoner once say that he had lent an inspeotor of police Sal. Re-examined.-He did not believe that the statenent about lending the money to an insVector was true. By Mr. SLuIGH.-Witness made a written report of what had occurred to the inspector before he was examined at the police court. Mr. G. Mackrell, the inspector, corroborated the evidence given by Sergeant Knight as to what occurred at the prisoner's lodging. He also stated that on the morning of the robbery his attention was particularly attracted to the appearance of the prisoner, and said that he told him that he was faint, and asked permission to go out and get a cup of coffee. When he returned witness called him two or three tines, and he did not answer, and witness called him to account for his neglect. He appeared very 'restless until 6 o'Cock, when he left the police-station to go home. The witness also proved that whije he was at the lodging of the prisoner he told him that it wras a very seriOUS matter; that a lrge sunm of money had been stolen from llr. Benham'4 aD that lie was suspected, and witness had come to seaxcix .hua lodgings, He appeared very much agitated, and replied, "Very well; you are welcome." The witness produced the duplicates fonnd by him in the prisoner's lodgmn, and it appeared that two of them referred to articles of clothing ledged in November and December for small amounta e also stated that he went subsequiently to Mr. Carrutbers nd obtained from him a quantity of silver, and among it was the shilling that was spoken to by one of the witnesses When the prisoner was taken to the police-station he oomplained of being detained, and said that he had done nothing Wisness said he had not found the gold that was een in his possession in the morning, and the prisoner rephed that he had no gold, and he did not care if a hundred pepple swsore that he had. ?r. Carruthers, the landlord of the New Inn publichonse, inBulstrode-street, provedthat on the morning afterthe robbery the prisoner and several other constables were at his house from half-past 6 to half-past 8 o'clock, and he also said, that at the request of the prisoner be gave him a 51. note for five pounds worth of silver, and at the same time he saw several sovereigns in the prisoner's possession. Be afterwards gave the same silver he had received from the prisoner to the inspector. Chalkley, a constable of the D ivision, deposed that on the morning of the robbery, at the prisoner's request, he accompanied him to Mr. Carruthers, with several other constables, They all went into a room where there was a bagatelle board, and he saw the prisoner produce about 20 sovereigns, and he wrapped them up in a piece of paper. Some of the constables made observationsupontheprisoner's having so much money, but he did not hear exactly what was said. The prisoner puled out the money apparently to make a show of it. King, notherconstable, deposed to the same facts, and sid that upon observing the amount of money in the prisoner's piosseasdon he said to him, ' COmpton, you seem to have plenty of money this morning," and he replied, u~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 'Yes, I)nave, and I have got plenty more at home." Incross.examnination the witness said that he had heard the prisoner on previous occasions boast of having plenty of By Mr. BODxn~.-About a fortnight before this the prisoner told bim that he had lent some money to an imspector who had just died, and he said that this had straitened his circumstances, By Mr. SLE1GIL-The prisoner at the samo time said that lib expected to get the money that he had so lent very shortly. Several other constables were called, who gave similar evidence, and one of them stated that upon his remarldng to the prisoner that he appeared "flush" of money he repied that he had got 301. or 401. more about him, and that he had got 400. or 600h at home. Evidence was then given that on the morning of the robbery the prisoner went to a coffee-stall near the policestation, and had a cup of coffee, and that he said he had got a pocket fuU of money, and did not know how to spend it fast enough He then treated a country carter to a cup of coffee, putled out a pocket-book, and said he had received 40L on the day before. He then asked the carter what wages he received, and he said ls. a-week, and the prisoner said to him, "Here, my man, take this," andgave him half-acrown. The man eld out the money to the keeper of the stall, and showed it to him, and said he was very glad that he had gone to his sta]L Several other constables who were on duty on the same nilht were then called, and some of them proved that they on y saw the prisoner at very long intervals, and some of them not al, whereas, in the ordinar7 course of their duty, they ought to have frequently met him at different points of his heat. Mr. SLEIGH, at the close of the case for the prosecution, made a very earnest address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and he said that, although the charge was sought to be snpported by what was called circumstantial evidence, it appeared to him that there reaUy were no actual circumstances tending to show guilt at aU in the case, and that the only fast upon which the charge rested was thc sily and idle boastings of the prisoner. He remarked upon the fact of the prisoner having been for five years in the police, and to his father having also been in the same employment, and received a pension for good conduct, and he urged the extreme improbability, under these circumstances, that the prioner should have been guilty of so serious a crime as the one with which he was now charged. He then proceeded to argue that as the prisoner had been for five years in the police, and also worked at his, trade, it was not at all an improbable conjecture that the money that was seen in his possesSion was his own roperty and the result of his own earnings, and he concluded by urging that, in the absence c f anything like direct testimony, the prisoner was entitled to the benefit of the doubt that must exist in such a case, and ought to be acquitted. Mr. Baron MARTix having summed up the whole of the evidence with reat care and impartiality, The jury retired to consider their verdict, and in a few minutestheyreturnedinto court and found the prisoner Guilty,. The learned JUDGE, in passing sentence, said he entirely cencurred in the verdict of the jury, and he thought there could be no doubt in the mind of any one who had heard the evidence that the prisoner, and no other person, had commited this burglary, and the fact that he had never attempted to give any explanation how he became possessed of the money that was seen upon him appeared to him to be alone quite conclusive of the fact. Undtr what circumstances, then, was the crime committed 9 He was a man paid by the public to protect them, and they were heavily taxed to pay such men as he, and they had a right at least to expect to receive that protection, but when they found such a man actualy committing plunder upon those whom it was his duty to protect it was a very heinous offence indeed, and if the capital punishment had not been abolished, he would most assuredly have been executed. The law looked upon the crime of burglary under any circumstances with abhorrence, and the hours during which the offence could alone be committed-namely, between 9 at night and 6 in the morning-showed that the intention of the law was to protect people from being disturbed in their beds by acts of this desciption, and when the crime was committed by a person in the posit;ion of the prisoner it was of the most aggravated character, and he thereFore felt bound to inflict upon him the fnU punishment, which was that he be transported for life. Charles Williams, 24, and John Bryan, 18, who were convicted on Wednesday of a robbery with violence, were brought up forjudgment, and the former was sentenced to be transported for 20 and the latter for 15 years. John Brown, 28, who had pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of uttering a forged 51. Bank of England note, was ao brought up and sentenced to six years' penal servitude. This concluded the business of the present session, and he Court was adjourned to Monday next, at U o'clock. The whole of the petty jurors who had been summoned -%ere ordered to be in attendance on Tuesday morning, at a quarter to 10 o'clock. NEW COURT. (Before taeRECORDER.) William GaUicher was indicted, upon the coroner's warrant, for the manslaughter of Harpen Elderton. Mr. Giffard prosecuted, and Mr. Metcalfe defended. The witnesses proved that about half-past 2 on the morning of the 19th of December the prisoner, the deceased, and some companions were drinking at the Leaping Bar publichouse, Whitechapel, when some words arose. When they got into the street the prisoner began sparring at the deceased, who had a pipe in his mouth. Prisoner did not appear to wish to strike deceased, but merely to alarm him, ard in so doin he drove the pipe back with such force into his moutn that it broke, and one portion of the Etem lodged in the tongue, and another, four inches long, got fixed in the muscles of the throat. Thedeceased was taken to the hospital, where he lingered until the 23d, when he died from internal hemorrhage. The prisoner was found Guilty, and sentenced to one mouths imprisonment. (Bcforc Mr. Jud* ice WiLLs&) Chrpstoher Stannard, 33, butcher, was indicted for the manslaughter of Sarah Tydeman Mr. B. Smith prosecuted, and Mr. Payne defended. It appeared that prisoner, who was a babdriver, had upon the evening of the 21st of December taken up the deceased and her sister at King's-cross to convey them to the Marble Arch, He was, it appeared at that time drunk, and drove them very unsteadily until tley came to the Regent's Park, when he inquired his way. Having done so he then flogged his horse into a violent gaUop, and drove it into a cab that was coming in an opposite direction with such force that he was thrown from the box. The horse, which was much frnhtened, kept on its course and ran on to the pole of an o nnibus that was advancing. The pole struck the unhappy woman on the chest with such force that her spine was dislocated, and she died almost directly His LORDSBmIP told the jury that if they thought the prisoner had, through drunkenness and reckless driving, been the cause of his being thrown from the box he was liable for what followed. The jury found him Guilty. Mr. Justice WILLES said that the case was a very bad oe, and if passed iightly over would be productive of great public danger; therefore, for the sake of example and safety, he could not pass a milder sentence than 12 months' imprisonment.

GCrLDHALL.-WliXaM& Matthews was charged with baming robbed MIr. William Vickers of his watch. About 7 o'clock on Wednesday night the prosecutor was in Long-lane, Smithfield, when he waS accosted by the prisoner and another man, who inquired the way to the ztrand He directed them, and pointed towards Snow-hilL Prisoner's companion thereupon renewed the inquiry, as though not understanding the way, and prosecutor kept his band raised pointing in the direction they should go. Not content with this, the man not in custody again asked the road, and prosecutor was about directing him when he felt & tug at his watch, and saw it directly afterwards in the pnsoner's hand, torn from a silver guard to which it was attached. Re seized hold of the prisoner by the collar, and a struggle ensued in which both fell and prosecutor (who is lame, and walks with crutches) had some difficulty in rising, thereby enabUng the prisoner to escape. He, however, saw the watch passed to the prisoner's companion, and gave information at the police-station, which led to tho prisoner's subsequent apprehension by Hancock, a detective officer, who found him at 16, Bell-alley, Goswellstreet, in bed with a woman and a man. Prosecutor went to the station, and immediately identified prisoner as the man who had robbed him. The offioer stated that he knew the prisoner well, and that he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment in July last from this court. He asked for a remand, in order that he might make further inqu7mes relative to the prisoner's companion, which Alderman HALE granted till Saturday. Remanded accordingly. Sir R. W. CAR"zN requested that the preps would acknowled e the receipt of two donations-one of 11. from a asdyath ?orcyr nd hnother of 6s from "T.C.

BOW-STREET.-Julian Payne, the youth remanded from last week on a charge of obtaining 66 copies of The Timm from Mr. Monger, clerk to Messrs Smith and Sons, wholesale newsvendors, of the Stand on the false pretence that he was sent for them by Mr. Pavey, of Holywell-street, newsvendor, was brought up for final examination. ifr. HXNRY inquired if the Messrs. Smith were disposed to prosecute at the sessions Mr. Monger was instructed to say that Messrs. Smith wished to leave the matter in his Worship's hands. Mfr. HsNY expressed his decided opinion that the case ought to go for trsal. He could well understand that in an extensive business like that of Messrs Smith it would be imposble to test the suthority of every newsboy who came for papers and said he was sent by a publisher. If, when a boy was detected saying so falsely, and thus obtaining papers, he was allowed to go unpunished it would soon become impossible to carry on the business lMr. Monger said they certainly had no time to make inquies If a boy said he came from a publisher the papers were handed over at once. In answer to a questio n from his Worship he stated that upwards of 35,000 copies of Te TImes were sold by Messrs. Smith every morning. The prisoner was committed for trial, George Morton, a wood carver, out of work, but occasionally employed to do "odd jobs" for Mr. Carter, of Berwick-street, coachbuilder, was charged with obtaining goods from Messrs. Onion and Co., dealers in coachtrimmings, 40, Drury-lane, by means of a forged order. It appeaed that on various occasions, from the 22d of December to the 5th of January, the prisoner had obtained goods from MIessr& Onion on the pretence that he was sent by 3Ir Carter, who was one of their customers. The aniounts varied from X 10s. to 41. 2s., and made up a thtal of about 301. On the 5th inst. he produced an order in writing, signed "H Carter." This was found to be a orgery, and the prevous orders fictitious iHe presented another forged order on Wednesday, and was given in He ws committed for triaL. Mr. H&vRy has received a donation of 1OL for tho poorbox from " A. B.," who requested an acknowledgment in The Times. MARYLEBoNL-Mr. P. Berkeley sent to this court 101. for the poor-box. WEms.nsnstJ ane Oldfield, a young woman, was charged with taking poison. An artisan went into a publichouse in York-street, Westminster, a few days ago 'and there saw the defendant sitting in the taproom. As there was something very singular in her appearance, he approached and spoke to her, when, in reply to his inquity of what was the matter with her, she pointed to a piece of paper on the table, on which was written "Oxalic acid-poison." She appeared in a very bad state, and vas immediately taken to the hospital, where she remaned some days, The Magistrate, having pointed out to her the enormity of the offenoe she had meditated, gave her up to her mother, who promised to take care of her. The remaining half of & 51-note from "EI C ," and 101. from "A.B," for the poor-box, came to hand. An acknowledgment was requested in The Time. WoRsEaP-sTnRv.-r.oseph Chubb Martin, a respectablelooking man of 34, was charged on suspicion of the foUowing robbery. A gentleman namod Smith, residing on Paynter-terraco, East mndia-road, stted that he took his son on the preceding evening to see the pantomime at the Standard Theatre, and seeing the crowd was very dense, and hearing a constable warn people to take care of their pockets, he buttoned his overcoat over his waistcoat, in ,hich he had a gold watch worth 251., and placed his hand outside over the watch. On reaching the box entrance he found himself next to the prisoner, who suddenly placed his band upon the witness's chest, as if trying to get back, and saying "II think I have made a mistake, as I want to go to the pit," was attempting to move awav, when witness saw his guardchain had been dragged somewhow out of his ooat, and was hanging loosly over the'prisoner's hand. He immediatell felt for his watch, d, fding it had been snapped off the c ain and stolen, he seized the prisoner and accused him of the robbery. The prisoner declared he was a respectable man, that witness ws mistaken, and told him to look on the floor, but witness held him and called for the police, and another man, who had been just before standing behind the prisoner leaped over the partition into the pit entrance, and was at once out of sight. Nothing had been seen or heard of the watch since. Wakeling, 133 G, while on duty outside the theatre, heard cries for the police, and forced his way in and secured the prisoner The prisoner could not get out if he had tried, the crowd was so dense behind him, and he offered to be searched, but the watch was not on him. He gave his address in Bath-street, Tabernacle -square, to which witness went, and he was denied by the landlady, but he insisted be did live there, and ultimately a little girl there claimed him as her brother. The prisoner protested his innocence, and alleged, as an answer to the officer's statement, that he was a shoemaker by trade, had formerly worked at Reading, and had not been in employment some time from ill-health, but Alderman, the gaoler, at once identified tho prisoner as having been in custody at this court three or four years ao since when he had lost sight of him, and when he gave his name as Martin only, without Chubb, and the prisoner was therefore committed till that day week, with liberty to find responsible bail, if he could procure them, in 401. each. SOuTnwARR.-ColvilleGeorge ColviUe, commonly known as Lord Colvile, lately of some notoriety at different policecourts in the metropolis, appeared upon his recognizances to answer the charge of obtisning two hats under fraudulent pretences from Messr. Lawson and Co., hatters, Welington-street, London-bridge. Mr. BuRcnAx said, under all the circumstances he should discharge the defendant, although he must say the prosecators had done quite right in bringing the case before the Court, The defendant was then discharged from custody. Mr. BuRCSAm received a check forI101, from "B. A," and 1. from "B. F.," for the poorbox of this court. LAMBsgr,-Tohn Plumley, a young manvwhose friends were said to be highly respectable, was finally examined before the Hon. G. C NORTON on a charge of uttering no less thn six forged 51.-notes Charles Iangdon said in the early part of the month of May last he was employed as waiter at the Flora-gardens, Camberwell, and a short time before the prisoner had been engaged at the same gardens. Early in that month he saw theoprisoner at the gardens, and askod him what he was going to stand, and he replied, " Anything you like if you Vet me change for a 5.-note." He (witness) said he would o so, and the prisoner gave him a 5-note, which he took to the house of Mr. Eletcher, the Clarendon Arms, in the Camberwell-new-road, and got ehange for it, In about two days after the prisoner gave hims another note, which ho got changed at 3r Martin's, tho Prince Albert public-house, and c thtrd which he got changed at Mr. Woodcock's, the Windmill publichouse, in the NVyndham-road, and always gave the change to the prisoner. For passing these three notes he, LIngdon, was taken into custody, examined, and committed from this court. He was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey for the offence, but acquit'ed, the jury believing his defence that he had received the notes from the Vnsont who was then at large, having absconded immediately, Iefore be (witness) had been apprehended, The wwes h SarsetbeloigYoung man, complained of the serious injury done to his character, to say nothing of the degradation of taking his trial at the bar of the OId Bailey, on three different charges of feloniously utter. ing three forged banknotes, of which offence he was as innocent as any person then in court. It might be said that the possession of notes by such a person as the prisoner was sufficient to excite his suspioion, but the fact was that it bad been reported in the gardens and generally believed he had come into a large sum of money, and that this was the cause of his giving up his situation. The prisoner himself had told him (witness) that he was soon to receive his money, when it was his intention to take the gardens himself and make him head-waiter, and he therefore thought it not extraordinary his having a few 51.-notes. In conclusion the witness said that since his acquittal he had applied for several situations, but the moment he mentioned his name he was told that he was the person who bad been tried for passing forged notes, and the parties refused to have *nything to do with him. lvr. MnOToN admitted that it was a very hard case, but hoped this prejudice against him would be now removed, as it was quite apparent and was his (Mr. Norton's) perfect convicion that he was entirely innocent of passing the notes knowing them to be forgeries. Mr. fletcher, landlord of the Clarendon Arms, provod haing taken one of the forged notes produced from the last witness, and the other from the prisoner himself Miss Rebecca Tamer, of the Globe coffee-house, in the London-road, deposed to changing one of the notes produced for the prisoner, anti Mrs. Goddard, the wife of a baker, gave similar testimony respecting another note. Evidec ws also given zespecting tho niotes passed to Mr. Martin and Mr. Woodock, which completed the depositions in the six cases The prisoner who when tlkea at Sheerness by Sergeant Corpin confesed his gullt of all the chages, and who now offered nothing in defence, was fully committed for trial. Mr. NORTON requesed the acnowledgment of a check for 1Os. from `B1. A.,~ Park-street, Groevenor-square, and the remaining half of a 56.-note from "E. C., for the poorbof.

SIILMAN'S LATIN CHRISTIANTY.* If a literary Englishman should be anxious for 'iontempormry reputation the very last subject to which a judicious friend would think of directing him is ecclesiastical history. To reap any substantial harvest within this department of knowledge demands not only a rare combination of high ment.l qualities, but preparation of a kind to which the habits of this country are, in the present century, altogether adverse. Not only mustthe ecclesiastical historian be a profound and accurate sebolar, possess a subdued judgment and a single eye in its exercise, but he must make up his mind to pass the best years of his life in pursuits which few comprehend, and fewer still respect; to pass for that most despised of human beings in practical England, a bookworm; aud, even in the character of a man of letters, to be altogether obscured by the crowd of popular writers. Like the hierophants of ancient story in their caves, he must be content to remain bis score or so of years in his study before emerging to teach mankind. rf he have not the temper of a philosopher, the result of his labours will, after all, only be to fkirnish a new store of weapons for some form of fanaticism; while, if he possesses this, he may think himself fortunate should his treasures, dug with so much toil from the depths of unfrequented authorities, be received in a spirit of common fairness, and not greeted with the yell of disappointed bigotry. The accomplished Dean of St. Paul's, while enunmerating the distinguished foreign writers wlho have preceded him-the Magdeburg Centuriators, Baronius,-the great French scholars, Tillemont, Fleinry, Dupin,-the Germans Mosheim, Schroeck, Neander, and others who have wrought with an indefatigable industry in the annals of Christianity-asks, where, alas ! are the English historians ? Surely there need be little difficulty in explaining thedeficiencyto wlhich his question poinits. We are not either a reading or a writing people, and, as a national characteristic, entertain a most cordial dislike for every one who is not engaged in some definite career. Learning, except its application be obvious, as in the case of a schoolmaster, excites not merely contempt, but something very like suspicion, especially among that class 'which calls itself the religious public. It is true that a great scholar does not now run much risk of being burnt, hut the hitter attacks which were made upon the distinguished translators of Niebn,r.'s .Hia'ary uf Rome, and the spirit in which all utUestions having reference to biblical criticism are handled in malay of our periodicals, certainly do not allowv any very favourable comparison of this century with the one which witnessed the imprisonment of Galileo. Dr. Milman, however, is an instance of one who, in spite of the adverse influences we have adverted to, has produced a wvork destined to take its place by the side of any which the soundest scholars of France or (4ermany have achieved. His History ,f Latin Chriatianity will go down to posterity as an evidence that the English clergy of these times were not all infected with the fopperies of dlilett(titte medi.tvalism or the fanatical prejudices of the Conventicle; but that there were some, at any rate, able to contemplate the spectacle of the Papal power calm-ly and rationally, -without either bowing down before it in foolish acdmiration or assailing it with hootings and execrations. Tracing the history of the Roman church from her first obscure rudiments, when the few lineaments which can be discerned are those of a small Greek religious colony-one out of many-his narrative pursues her expanding fortunes in intimate connexion with those of the Imperial city in which she was placed, until at last, arrived face to face with what the author happily calls Teutonic Christianity, she seems to have found a barrier which she caniot overthrow. This term Dr. Milman uses in its most comprehensive significance, includiu', together with the episcopal churches, like that of England, which aspire to maintain both the doctrines and organization of the apostolic age, those coinmunions where Christianity almost melts into a moral theism. " As an historian," says lie, "I can disfranchise none who claim, even on the slightest grounds, the privileges and hopes of Christianity; repudiate none who do not place themselves without the pale of believers and worshippers of Christ, or of God through Christ." The essential characteristic of Latin Christianity is the retention, in an ecclesiastical organization, of the spirit which animated the Roman State. Rigid adherence to legal form and severe maintenance of authority distinguish Christian as much as Pagan Rome. The supremacy of the Pope was the reproduction of the Imperial sway, extended over Europe by the universal code of church law, and enforced by the hierarchy of religious prietors or proconsuls. The chain of obedience extended from the throne of the spiritual C:esar to the lowest ranks of society, binding all together in one organic wvhole. How this phenomenon gradually developed itself is described in nervous and eloquent language, with profound learning, and a power of condensation which has rarely been equalled, in the work before us. That the style should sometimes be obscure where a sentence is often macle to convey the results of a whole investigation can be no matter of wonder; neither can it that at times the interest of the reader flags, as lie wearily follows the narrative of the petty intrigues of German or Italian princes with which the history of the Papal Power is intertwined. It was not possible for any amount of genius to clothe the moral deserts over which the course of ecclesiastical history lies with the freshness and verdure -which the traveller longs for; but Dr. Iilman never fails to do justice to every oasis he finds, and there are passages -which as unequivocally evidence the hand of the poet as the whole of the work does that of the philosopher and scholar. The period of 14 centuries, over which his labours extend, he divides into as many unequal portions, each of which has its characteristic features, which serve as landmarks to fix upon the memory the main events of the time. The first of these, which includes no less than 400 years, closes with the pontificate of Siricins, the successor of Damasius, whose secretary, St. Jerome, one of the four great Latin Fathers, has left in his voluminous writings a complete picture of the tinies in which he lived. The obscure Christian community of three centuries back has now cbanged its character, and even its language. Its ritual and its Scriptures have ceased to be Greek. It now embraces the dominant religious party in the Roman patriciate, and, more than that, in the R oman people. The emulation of men has taken a new field for its exercise. The election to the Christian bishopric has come to be contested wvith all the fierceness which characterized the struggles for the curule offices in the days of the common wealth. It seemns as if the unquenchable spirit of liberty, restrained by the iron hand of the IRoman Emperors from the expression of its will in secular matters, had become re-animated in all its ancient violeiice when the (luestion of the successor to the chair of St. Peter has to be decided. The triumph of Damasius over his competitor was not achieved 'without a tumult in which blood cwas poured out like water, churches converted into forts, besieged and stormed at the cost of many lives. In one basilica alone the historians of the time relate that no less than 130 dead bodies were counted as they lay. The pollp and prodigality of the Pontiff contrasted as strongly with the humble condition of his spiritual ancestors as the magnificence of a Liculhls with the homely simplicity of a Fabricius; and yet with all this there was combined a religious devotion-mistaken, indeed, in its airection, but earnest and vehement to a degree -which has never been surpassed. It appeared especially in two forms-that of the extremest profuseness in the offerings to the churchl, and the sternest asceticism in the conduct of self-discipline. The passioni which prevailed so strongly among the Roman nobles in the first and second centuries, to make the Emperor their heir, took in the fourth the turn of a similar devotion to the church. This was doubtless sotnetimes the effort of the troubled conscience endeavouriug by sueh means to find rest, but in the great majority of *nstances it can only be accounted for by the nattural vehemence of the Roman character, as prone to excess in its virtues as in its vices. Poverty, not posthumous only, was sought with ardour, even in its extreniest form. The most cruel peniances and maceratious were not cheerfully submitted to, but anxiously de.nanded. Among the women of the higher ranks in particiular there appeared to be a kind of reaction from the unstinting profligacy of the Imperial timnes to a severe chastity which looked 'with scorn on the virtues of the Christian wife or matron. One of these noble ladies, Blesilla, a young widow, of oiie of the oldest patrician houses, and the possessor of extraordinary wealth, shrank frown the iiportunate persuasions of her friends to marry again, and actually died (as was generally believed) under the effect of the severe discipline whieh her spiritual director, Jerome, enjoined. Public indignation broke out in a tumult at her funeral. "Why tolerate we these accursed monks ?" they cried. " Away with them ! stone them ! cast them into the Tiber !" But the monastic principle was in I the ascendant, anjd these partial outbreaks, in which the instincts of human nature asserted themselves, were the acts of a decreasing minority. The poIItificate of Siricius, who followed Damasius, is marked by the publication of the first authentic Decretal, a letter of the Bishop of Rome, in which the celibacy of the priesthood and diaciate wvas enforced, and thus the doctrine of tbe inherent perfection of virginity, as compared with the married state, authoritatively recognized. It was in vain that some eminent names protested against this new theory. Their arguments were swept away not more by the tide of authoritv, represented by the voices of Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine, than by the popular seutiment. The most important event, however, of this time, as regards the future fortunes of the Latin Church -more important than even the rapidly increas'ing power of monasticism-was the promulgation of the new Latin version of the ScriptLures, or what is now called the "Vulgate," of which Jerome wV£s the exclusive author. The influence of this translation can only be paralleled by that of King James's English version, and by that only faintly. "Jerome's Bible," says Dr. Milman,- " Almost created a new language. The inflexible Latin became pliant and expansive, naturalizing foreign Eastern imagory, Eastern modes of expression and thought, and Eastern rehlious notions most uncongenial to its ownI genius and cluaracter; and retaining much of its own peculiar strength, solidity, and majesty. If the Northern, the Teutonic, languages coalesce with greater facility wvith the I Orientalism of the Scriptures, it is the triumph of Jerome to have brought the imiore dissonant Latin into harmony with the Eastern tongues. The Vulgate was, even more perhaps than the I'apal power, the foundation of Latin Chlristianity." This translation, enormous as its influence has been in the sequel, was at first by no means favourably received. Jerome himself was unwilling to undertake the task, which was urged upon him by his master, the Pope. The object of the latter was to put an end to the inconveniences resulting from the multitude of Latin translations which were current, and he had accordingly urged Jerome to assume the responsibility of correcting these. This was no easy task, independently of the odium which woould obviously attend it. "As soon as ev-er the reader, learned or unlearned," says Jerome, "' takes my book in hand, and finds any variation from wvhat he himself has been accustomed to, of course he will indignantly charge me with forgery and sacrilege for daring to make any addition, change, or correction in the sacred volume." Utnder these circumstances, the course whlich he adopted with the New Testament, with which he began his task, was to take the oldest and best Greek manuscripts he could procure, and correct the commonly received version I from these, in those places only where the sense was materially affected. With the Old Testament the problem was a still more difflcult one; this u-as not conimenced until after the death of Damasius. whose successor Jerome had hiopcd to become. Ee was designated, according to his own account, by almost unanimous consent for the office. Dr. Milman makes some admirable remarks upoII this disappointment:- "Is the rejection of an aspirant so singularly unfit for the station, from his violent passions, his insolent treatment of his adversaries, his utter want of self-commiand, his almost unrivalled faculty of awakening hatred, to be attributed to thse sagacious and intnitive wisdom of Rome? Or, as is far more probable, did the vanity of Jerome mistake outward respect for general attachment, awe of his abilities and learning for admiration; and so blind hima to the illdissembled, if dissembled, hostility which he had provoked m so many quarters ?" Alost undoubtedly his great work could not have been achieved at Rome, or by himself on the Papal throne, although he certainly would not, as Dr. .Milman laments of a dignitary of the present day, who once gave promise of achieving a reputation in the republic of letters, " have settled down into a quiet bishop." He left Rome, and finally retired to his cell at Bethlehem, where he completed his task, after 20 years of toil, in the year 405. This new translation of the Old Testament was undertaken from a polemical motive. The early Christian chiurches, with scarcely an exception, had used a Greek version, Greek being the general language of commerce at the time throughout the civilized world and Hellenized Jews, among whom the first Christian communities were formed, taking the lead among the commercial classes, even where they did not constitute them. When the course of events had made Rome, in addition to her other distinctions, the first commercial city of the world, the Latin language took the place of Greelk, and it became necessary to employ a Latin version of the Holy Scriptures in the new Latinized ritual. This was made, not from the original Hebrew, but from the Greek version, which had hitherto prevailed. It was only natural to expect that, when tlheological discussions grew up, the original text should be appealed to by a disputant who fancied that his cause would benefit by the appeal. In this instance it was the Jews who gave the chalenge, not, if wve are to believe their adversaries, in an altogether legitimate manner, but by arbitrary interpolation, or change in the commonly received readings of the Greek version (the so-called Septuagint), inder the pretext that the alterations were demanded by the Hebrew text. Jerome says he learnt Hebrew for the sole purpose of qualifying himself to stop the proceedings of these adversaries of the faith. His preceptor was a convert from Judaism. In the execution of his translation he was, to some extent, assisted by the previous labours of Origen, in his Bexapla, but still the task was a Herculean one. He translated sometimes at the rate of a thousand lines a-day, adapting his version to the readings of the Septuagint, here this did not widely differ from the original, and sometimes giving weight to the views of Aquila, Theodotion, or 6ymmachus, as he found them given by Origen. His own judgment was his court of last appeal in determining the words he should adopt whlle endeavouring both to avoid shocking the reader by too great change, and at the same time to preserve substantially the true sense of every passage; but his efforts to avoid offence were for a time altogether unsuccessful. The deviation from the Latini representative of the Septuagint was a sad scandal, especially among the African churches. A forged letter was circulated there as if from Jerome hiniself, in wvhich regret was expressed for what he had done, and his offence palliated by the assertion that the new translation from the original Hebrew wvas in accordance with a promise which he had inadvertently given when a young man to some Jews. Rufinus accused him of sacrilege in robbing the church of a part of the treasure inherited from the Apostles. Tlhis violent charge refers to the omission of the *' listory of Susaunah and the Elders," which, as not being found in the Hebrew text, Jerome had rejectecl. Even St. Augustine was mucl distressed at the consequences wvhich he feared would result from Jerome's boldness. *- The Scriptures of the Latin churches will vary from those of the Greek, and then, if a dispute arises, how is it to be decided ? Jt is easy enough to produce the Greek original. Everybody understands tUat. But how can we appeal to the HEebrew original?7 And suppose we do, who will think of allowing so many Latin and Creek authoxities to be set at nlought?f One curious instance of the inconvenience apprehended by Augustine was furnished by the passage in the " Book of Jonah," which speaks of the prophet sitting under a qw1nsrdl. The word so rendered in the Septuagint, and from the Septuagint in the older Latin versionis, really denotes a plant called in Egypt ;ikii, fi-om the seeds of which crotoni oil is extracted. As this had no Latin representative, Jerome had substituted "ivy" in his version, considering that in so doing he should give a better notion of the plant than by asiy other word familiar to a Latin reader. When, however, the passage was read in one of the African churches the novelty produced a complete uproar. Some Jews were appealed to for a decision between the old and the new translation, and, perhaps out of malice. gave it in favour of the former, to the great confusion of the bishop, who had much trouble in allaying the irritation of his flock, not without some loss of dignity to himself. Jerome, to whom Augustine tells this story in a letter, was extremely angry at the incident, and gave vent to his indigrnation against the arbitrators in language which is worthyof Johnof Tuam. Posterityhasbeenmore just to his great work than his own gsneration; but their snffragewaslongdelayed. Two centuries afterthe death of Jerome his version wasbecomingthefavourite one in the Western churches, and from that time forward its influence has prevailed more and mote, until at last, after the expl4ation of 1,000 years, its superior authority to even the original Hebrew and Greek became a tenet of the Rornan Catholic Church. With the exception of the Syriac and Arabic versions there is not a single ancient translation nninfluenced by it; and in modern times, through Wycliffe's version (which was rmade from it) it has left its traces in the English Bible now in common use. Yet, the rapidity of its execution and the pressure of other occupations in which its author I was engaged, caused him to set down many tlhins which maturer consideration and greater leisure would, as he himself allows, have much modified. Tha close of the fourth century exhibits Latinr Christianity firmly established and the foundation laid for that vast monarchical power which made the Popes of later times the rulers of Europe. WVhile Jerome by his translation of the Scriptures had created the language in which the church was to speak, Augustine had organized her theology, and in his City of God developed the idea of that new and undeined Vingdom, "that vast polity which was to rise out of the ruins of ancient and pagan Rome, if not to succeed at once to the teniporal supremacy, to superinduce a higher government-that of God himself." Not itself establishing any external autocracy, this sublime imagination prepared the way for it in the minds o men; and, when time was ripe for it, the spiritual city of Go'd became a secular monarchy, ruling by spiritual means. Before the dawning light of this newv sun it was time for the phantom relics of Paganism to vanish away from the face of the earth. Christianity must now be recognized not only as trtue, bnt aq the exclusive truth. Under the influence of Ambrose the final sentence of condemnation was passed upon the old religion, and the tutelar divinities of Rome were refused the last marks of respect which up to that time had been paid to them in the publc ceremonies. The world had' become Christian, and with Christianity the hierarchical system had embraced the world, although its pressure was not yet felt to be irresistible. Dr. Milman enters very fully into the special causes which tended to incline the Teutonic races towards Christianity in that particular form in which it was presented to them. The Greek polytheist had in many cases taken refuge in Christianity from the scepticisma in which his own worn-out creed left him; the Roman mind was led captive by the high moral tone and vigour of character which distinguished the early confessors. Yet in both these cases there was soniething in the ancient habits and cultivation of tlle Pagan so incongruouswith theprimitive Gospel, that the splendid ceremonial of the church in the one instance, and the religious philosophy of Alexandh-ia in the other, undoubtedly played a very important part in bridging over the gulf. Of the Teutonic character, in the other hand, some parts harmonized at once with Christianity. The German was familiar wifh the conception of an ilhmitable deity wvhom he regarded with reverential awe. The shrine where he worshipped was the impenetrable forest. It was incompatible with his notion of the greatness of the Godhead, as Tacitus tells us, to confine deities within walls, or to fashion them after human likeness. The belief in the immortality of the soul, again, was a part even of the popular creed, and in its operation to produce a total contempt of death became an active faith in constant exercise. A third point of congeniality between the religions at the time when the Teutoni races were brought into contact with Christianity was the great influence possessed by women, especially sacred virgins, over the rude tribes. The deep reverence for the sex undoubtedly prepared these for the reception of that tenet which had already begun to show symptoms of the all-absorbing importance which it afterwards attainedthe worship of the Virgin klary. It miglht be thouglt, at first sight, that in one particular there was a discordance between the two religions which must for ever keep them apart. How were the precepts of the mild and gentle Saviour of mankind to be recommended to a warhL-e people whose paradise was a Valhalla, and whose chief deity was invested with the attributes of Mars, of whlomii their priesthood appear in a sort the officers, branding the coward as the worst of offenders, and propitiating the divine favour by the sacrifce of human victims ? The explanation is to be found in the fact that the name of Christ had already become a rallying cry in the coniflict; the cross, the symbol of redemption, shone aloft on the standards of the legionaries; and the Teutonic conqueror, in accepting the new faith, regarded his act as merely the acquisition of another divine protector who would gladly receive and reward his allegiance. Add to this the circumstance that the heroic conduct of the Christian bishops and clergy, who, when everything else bowed belore the barbarian invaders, alone remained resolute and unyielding, braving insult and rrassacre, must undoubtedly have strengthened the conviction that a heroism for which death had no terrors was the distinguishing characteristic of the Christian as well as the Pagan. "The Germans," says Dr. AIlman, "would admire the martyr whom in their wantonness they slew, il that martyr showed true Christian tranquillity in his agony." And undoubtedly there was no danger from which the clergy shrank, no sacrifice which they were not eager to make. However alloyed with much that the enlightenment of modern times must despise, and the juster morality condemn, what an instance of Chrislian greatness and heroic earnestness is Gregory ! Of the noblest descent, and great wealth, and holding the distinguished position oE prnetor of the city of Rome, we see him, as soon as ever by the death of his father he became his own master, devoting his whole property to religious purposes, and tearing himself fromnthe secular life to which fortune seemed to woo him with her most irresistible blandishments. Out of seven monasteries founded by his own munificence he selects one for his own retreat; but -he enters not as abbot, but as one of the lowest of the brethren. Fastings, watching, and study destroy his health; but lie stil perseveres, and in process of time his constitution acquires power to bear the trials to which he subjccted it,-a result which the piety of the times attributed to the prayers of the holy Eleutherius. It was while he was engaged in this life, of all others the most congenial to his fervid temper, that the incident took place whicb, it is said, led to the conversion of our Saxon ancestors. " In the market-place of Rome Gregory saw some beautiful fair-haired boys exposed for sale. He inquired whence they caine. 'From Britain.' 'Are they Christians ?' 'They are still Paans' '*las! that the Prince of Darkness should possess forms of such loveliness! that such beauty of countenance should want that better beauty of soul !' Ie asked of what nation they were. 'Angles' was the reply. 'Truly,' he said, they are angels! From what province"' 'That of Deira.' 'Truly, they must be rescued dc ir4 (from the wrath of God). What is the name of their king?' 'Aella.' 'Yea,' said Gregory, 'Alleluiah must be sung in the dorninions of that king. To be the first missionary to this beautiful people, and win this remote and barbarous island, like a Christian CQsar, to the realn of Christ, became the holy ambition of Gregory. His long-suppressed humanity burst forth in this new channel. He extorted the unwilling consent of the Pope ; be had actually set forth and traveUed three days' journey wben he wvas overtaken by messengers sent to recall him. All Romehadrisenin pious mutiny amd compelled the Pope to revoke his permission." It was just after Gregory's return from Constantinople, whither he had been sent on an importantmission by the Pope, Pelagius, that the city of Rome became a scene of utter misery and desolation. The Lombardinvasionsv. erewasting Italy, andthe Exarch of Ravennfa acknow;ledged his inlability to protect Rome, while supplications for aid from Constanti- nople had been altogether unavailing. The Tiber swept away in an inundation the granaries vwhich contained the food of the people. Pestilence ensued, and the Pope fell one of the earliest victims. The eyes of all men turned upon Gregory, in sanctity, in learning, in sagacity, without a rival. Clergy, Senate, and people witb one voice summoned him to the pontifical throne. His remonstrances were in vain. He wrote to the Emperor Maurice to beg him to refuse the Imperial consent to his elevation. The letter wras intercepted, and the Prefect of the City substituted for it the general petition for his advancement. Popular admiration has clothed the circumstances of this time with a miraculous character. To escape the unwelcome dignity Gregory had disguised himself and sought refuge in a solitary forest ; but a light like a pillar of fire hovered over his head and betrayed I him. He was taken by force to the church of St. Peter, and there consecrated Supreme Pontiff. Once Pope, he threw off at once his taste for a contemplative life, and plunged into affairs with an j activity which has never been surpassed. Nothing I was too great or too small for his personal solicitude. We find him now engaged in regulations Efor the management of the Papal farms in Sicily, now ocupied with the conversion of Britain, now extirpating clerical sizony in Gaul, now negotiating w iththe armed conquerors of Italy, and now protest. ing againt the assumn of the title of Universal Bishop by t'ne patriarch of Constantinople. His language upon this last subject in a letter to the Emperor haurice is most remarkable. The most eNalous Protestant could not exr~ress himself ;in strOnger terms against the assnptiim ns of the successors of Gregory than those which he himself supplies | While every part of Europe is abandoned to the dominion of the barbariane, while cities are destroyed, fortresses overthrown, provinces depopulated, lands without inhabitants, and the worshippers of idols daily reveUing in the raassacre of the faithful, the priests, who ought to be wailing in dust and ashes, are inventiDg new and profanc appellations to gratify their pride. Ant I defending my own cause ? Is this any special injury to the Bishop of home 2 It is the cause of God-the cause of the whole church. And who is he that usurps this uncanonical dignity s The prelate of a see repeatedly ruled by heretics, by Nestorians, by Macedonians. Let all Christian hearts reject the blasphemous rame. It was once applied by the Council of Chalecdon, in honour of St. Peter, to the Bishop of Pome; but the more humble pontiffs of Rome would not assume a title injurious to the rest of the priesthood." To the offender himself he addresses the awful Iwarning that "W hoever calls himself Universal Bishop is Antichrist." It is a curious circumstance that the very piety and learning of Gregory were nearly the means of procuring the authoritative sanction of a false principle in the interpretation of Holy Scripture, vhich would have been equivalent to the promulgation of a new religion. His MIagta Jlrorali; or Bxposition of ite Book of Job, is founded on the supposition that that portion of Holy Writ was not only a true and wonderful history, but an allegory containing, in its secret sense, the whole theory of the Christian church and Christian sacraments, and a moral philosophy applicable to the whole of mankind. He discovers in the different features of the narrative latent adumbrations of all the great Christian doctrines, and unrelenting condemnation of all heresies and heretics. Nothing, indeed, can be more arbitrary than the manner in which he detects mysteries, except, perhaps, the lucubrations of some modem interpreters of prophecy; but so congenial was the work to the Christian mind, and so great the authority of Gregory, that many bishops began to read it publicly in their churches; and but for the remonstrances of the author himself it would probably have come into general use, have gradually acquired a canonical rank, and been regarded as possessing the authority of revelation. The proceedings of Gregory in the early part of his pontificate, to avert from his people the miseries of pestilence and famine, are equally characteristic of the zealous Christian pastor and the paternal ruler. His estates in Sicily supplied the corn which kept the poor population of Ilome from perishing. ln the meantime he constantly addressed them from the pulpit, anjl encouraged them by his presence. The origin of that kind of service which goes by the nanie of Litany, or Processional, dates from this time. The whole population of Rome was marsballed in seven bodies, and traversed the streets with prayers and penitential hymns. The clergy and the sacred virgins, the widows and the children, the laity, rich and poor, all had their assigned -share in this solemnity. The cry of the whole city literally ascended to the throne of the Almighty. The pestilence was not stayed; no less than 80 victims fell dead during the procession; but neither the faith of the people nor of their bishop failed, and after ages nioulded this fact into a picturesque tradition, which contemporary accounts do not justify, that as the last troop of suppliants reached the monument of Hadrian the Destroving Angel was seen to sheathe his sword. The statue which crowns the castle of St. Angelo, as it is now called, commemorates the miracle. The extraordinary influence of Gregory's character is shown, however, in nothing so much as in the power which he obtained over the Lombard invaders of Italy, and this by purely religious means. Agilulf, their leader, had married Theodelinda, a Bavarian princess, bred up in the orthodox, faith. In the second year of Leo's pontificate his predatory bands poured into the south of Italy, and appeared before Rome, defended by a weak garrison. The Romans of the highest rank and familv without the wals were dragged into captivity. Grecgory was preaching to the people, and suddenly was compelled to break off in these words " If I must now break off my discourse, ye who share in my tribulations are my witnesses for what reason I do so. On all sides we are begirt with war; everywhere is there imminent peril of death. Some return to us with their hands chopped off, some are reported captives, some as slain. I am constrained to cease from my exposition, for I am weary of life. Who can expect me now to devote myself to sacred eloquence, now that my harp is tuned to mourning, and my speech to the voice of them that weep r' But, imminent as the peril was, it was overcome by the firmness and presence of mind of the bishop. The commanders of the garrison, encouraged by him, succeeded in averting the capture of the city, and the pontiff took advantage of the resDite to appeal to Theodelinda, and urged her to show her genuine Christianity by checking the effusion of blood. He followed up the success of this attempt by further efforts, which, after sorne years, led to a definitive treaty of peace. " In their very hour of conquest," says Dr. Milman, "Gregory was subduing the conquerors." The design which Gregory had formed, while yet a monk, of evang elizin Britain he carried out,after his acesion to the Papacy. Dr. Milman has some Judicious remarks on the impossibility, humauly speaking, that this great work should ever have been effected by the agency of the already existino British Church. A century of continued warfarebtween the two races must necessarily have increased the jealousyTwith which the two religions regarded each other; besides which, while the fierce pagans revolted at the idea of adopting the religion of a conquered people, the British Christians appear to have consoled themselves for the loss of their territory by the consideration of the eternal misery which was in store for the heathen victors, and even advisedly to have abstained from any attempts to rescue them from this doom. The name of Rome, on the contrary, must have sounded awful to the ear of Ethelbert, whose consort, a Frank-ish Prin?ess, had stipulated for the free exercise of her religion; and when Auguatine, with his 40 attendant monks, first landed on the shores of Kent he was received with courtesy and hospitality. The confident demeanour of the missionaries impressed the barbarians favourably. They advanced with all the pomp they could command, chanting their litanies in the solemn Gregorian tones. A crucifix of silver and a picture of the Saviour were borne in the front of the procession. The King, with a vague dread of magical arts, had required that they should meet him in the open air, and the intercourse between them was carried on through the medium of an interpeter, the Teutonic languages being as unknown to Augiistine as Latin was to Ethelbert. Nevertheless, in spite of these unpropitious ciremnstances, the Kling of Kent was soon an avowed convert. Augustine received the rank of Metropolitan, and his see, after some doubt between that place and London, was fixed at Canterbury. The ardent mind of Gregory already contemplated the spiritual conquest of the whole island, divided as it was into pagan kingdoms in continual conflict with one another. He designed to establish a second metropolitan see at York, and to distribute each province among 12 bishops. A constant correspondence was kept up between him and Augustine; and in this there appears a liberality of mind far in advance of his age, as well as a profound knowledge of human nature. Aware of the force of habit, especially with the common people, his policy 'wastoretainmany of theexternalceremoniesto which the SaXons were accustomed, but to imbue these as much as possible with a Christian spirit and give them a Christian significance. He forbids the demolition of the sacred fanes of the heathen, but commands them to be cleared of their idols, purified for the services of the church, to have new altars set up in them, and the relics of Christian martyrs enshrined. The oxenwhich used to be immolated in honour of Thor or Woden were still brought in procession on holy days, and eaten in honour of the Christian festival by the multitude that assembled, as of yore, under huts or tents of boughs. The ritual which was introduced in England by Augustine was in Latfh, an unknown tongue to all but the clergy, but probably little known to such .of these as were natives of Britain. It is at first difficult lo understand how, under such circumstances, the conversion of the realm could proceed. But upon a rude people it is not easy to overestimate the effect that would be produced by the solemn choral service of the Roman church. So much importance was attached to this, that the chief of the Roman choir was allowed to accompany Benedict Biscop to England in order to instruct the monks of Wearmouth in signing. Besides the magical effect of the ritusil, too, the severe lives of the missionaries, theirnstant prayers and vigils, and their obvious contem6pt.of danger, rust have operated strongly to inllu6nm .e people wvho, above all things, valued * History of Latin ClaiitioniSy, incitudmgy that of the Popes to flip Po-liheole of NVicoas T.

Doubtless, even in the earliest times, there were attempts made at preaching in the but none of these (if such were twriting)have been preserved. The Pontificate of Gregory the Great marks the final Christianization of the world. Heathenism ; was utterly extinct. The Christian hierarchy has full possession of the minds of men. Ecclesiastical Latin is the only language of letters; art, so far as it exists &t all, is exclusively Christian. But the transition from the primitive Gospel has become no less striking than the triumph over Paganism. The creeds of the church now form but a very smaU portion of Christian belief. The Almighty Father has receded, as it were, from human vision into a I vague sanctity; the divine Saviour himself occupies but a comparatively small portion of the heart of the worshipper, absorbed with other objects of reverence, more open (as it seemed) to human sympathies. The shrines and the relics of martyrs are now the favourite resort of the great multitude of the believers. Hero worship-the heroism being of the monastic "ye-is in the ascendant. Legends of saints rival, if they do not supplant, the narratives of Scripture in the possession of the popular mind. The ordinary providence of God gives place to a peroetual strife between evil spirits and good angels about the person of every individual believer. No protection against the former is so effective as the presence of the departed saints, especially if in the vicinity of their own places of sepulture. Happy the churches which possessed the inestimable treasure of the body, or even a portion of the body, of an earlyconfessor. The sacred talisman was an effectual security against calamity; nay, its virtue extended even to .tbe absolving from sin. Relics have attained a selfdefensive power; profane hands which endeavoured to remove them withered; the chains of St. Paul sometimes refused to yield filings-au inestimable gift, when they could be procured, for a barbaric King !Thetauntwhicltlhe Christian writers of earlier times threw out against their Pagan adverssries, that their temples were most of them tombs of dead men, could now be retorted with interest. The possession of the bones of Orestes was not more ardently coveted by the Laced&emonians than the remains of departed worthies by Gregory himself, intellectually as well as spiritually, by the confession of all, the model of his age. He himself obtained an arm of St. Andrew and the head of St. Luke from Constantinople, although to the petition of the Empress Constantia he refused anything beyond a cloth which had touched the sacred body of St. Paul at Rome. Thus, moulding together elements derived from all sources-Jewish, Pagan, and Christian-arose the vast and complicated system of medieval Christianity, a system as little to be despised as the offspring of fraud as to be justified as a genuine development of the primitive GospeL
A SUBAfARrNE VOLCANO. (From the San Francisco Heirald.) Captain C. H. Newell, of the whaling bark Alice Frasier, gives the following description of the action of a submarine volcano which sprang into existence in the Straits of Onnimah, in lat. 54 36, long. 165, on the 25th of July last. There were five or six vevssels in company at the time when the volcano burst, and threw an iamnense body of water to a tremendous height; after which it emitted lava and pumicestone on the ecks of the vesseL This singular oceanic phenomenon is corroborated by the masters of the whaling ships William Thompson, Scotland, and Enterprise:- " Bark Alice Frasier, at Sea, Oct. 30, 18.3G. "AbouLt the 25th of July, while passing in company with some others through the Straits of Onnimah, I observed many of the mountain peaks upon the adjacent islands undergoing strong volcamc action, ejecting vast clouds of dense Dlack smoke. " A few other whalers, in company with myself, had just rounded the west point of the island, close to the base of the volcano, upon that end of it, having been enjoying the close view of its tremendous eruption, and hstening to the long rumbling roar as we underwent several successive shocks of nartial earthquake, when the vn&d suddenly died av,ay from a strong breeze to a calm, and left us entirely at the mercy of the eruptions, close in with the land. After several hours of various grades of action everything seemed to grow for the worse. The throes of the elements and groans of the sphere became rapidly more and more ominous. It became perfectly calmso calm that the dense, black, unearthly smoke from the crater rushed headlon; into the heavens, without deviating to any point,-an indicationthat there was afainthope of a coming breeze for us 2 then gradually dissipated into cold gray clouds, from which fell showers of ashes, looking in the distance like rain, though falling rather like snow flakes. At this stage of things, after about 12 hours' calm, there sprang up a light breeze from the south, seemingly about to rid us of our dangerous companion; and you may make no doubt but we endeavoured to profit by it, even to the smallest sail we could set. "But then came the worst of al. The winds, acting upon so dense a body of smoke, blew it flat down upon the surface of the water, making it for more than 100 miles, as I ascertained from others, an almost total eclipse, shutting the laud under it entirely from sight. The ashes rained down upon us like a snowstorm, covering everything from deck to truck under one gray mantle of cinders, almost blinding the people exposed, and growing gense and more dense, nearly to suffocation, until we began to conjure up another scene of Pompeii and Herculanenm, and think we should come off rather worse than Pliny's little fleet in the Bay of Naples. As the breeze increased we worked our way to the westward, leaving the scathing, suffocating mass rolling away to the north upon the eastern board. Once clear, we had a long job to get clear of the ashes-washing and scrubbing in abundance. I bave visited several volcanoes in their active stages, but that was a little more of the coalpit business than agreed with my taste in these nattersm " But the grand sublimity of the thing was all to come. As the breeze built up into a dashing wind along came four other shps. When, just as they got fairly in with the north base of this mountain, gazing upon the grand ebullition above them, there foUowed a long low runibling directly beneath them, and there sprang into instant existance simultaneous with the sound a vast terrific volcano among the very fleet. First, the waters boiled and rose tumultuously into chaotic waves; then sprang, as by an effort of some vast fountain, into a splendid column of rolling waters to a great height. This gradually dissipated. Then from earth to heaven, with a thundering sound which rocked the very welkin, there sprang a burst of smoke and flame as if earth's whole internal fires were seeking a vent therefrom. Folloving this it commenced casting p lava and pumicestone, from the size of a pebble to that of a boulder, covering all the vessels with lesser fragments of each, and keeping the ship's coinpanies in the most intense anxiety from fear of either being blown into the air or crushedbeneath the sea. These grades of action continued only for a time, the eruption sinking almnost as sudden as it came, when the waters roUed into the vacated chasm with the rush of a whirlwind, meeting in the centre from every direction, and whirling into a vortex only equalled by the Maelstrom, uttering a voice little short of the British Niagara heard from Table Rock. "The ships escaped, leaving the submarine volcano undergoing a succession of changes of comparative uietude and violent action, its throes assuming about the same character as the first, with unequal intervals limiting the various stages it passed through.

DEATH OF SIt EDMUND FiLmER, M.P.-This gentleman, one of the representatives of the western division of the county of Kent, died at his seat, East Snatton Place, near Maidstone, yesterday morning, about 8 o'clock. For many months past he had been in a declining state of health, and in the early part of last spring announced his intention of retiring from public life at the close of the present Parliament. Sir Edmund was the representative ot an ancient Kentish family, which has had large possessions and exercised considerable influence in the county for the last 300 years. He was the son of Catain Filmer, and nephew and heir-at-law of the Rev. Sir John Filmer, whose title *nd property he inherited. His mother was the widow of Sir XV. Geary, and mother also of the present Sir W. Geary. The late Sir Edmund Filmer was bonm in 180, and in 1831 married Miss Helen Monroe, daughter of Mr. ). Munroe, of Quebec, Canada. He succeeded his uncle in the baronetcy in 1834; and in March, 1838, on the resignation in his favour of his half-brother, Sir W. Geary, who had been elected in conjunction with Mr. T. Law Hodges at the general election in 1837, he was returned M.PJ for West Kent, which he continued to represent till the time of hi-s death. Sir Edmund is succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, who attained his majority in 1855. In politics the late baronet was a Conservative, and clung to agricultural protection down to 1852, when it was finaUy abandoned by the Derby Administration, and he has since strenuonsly opposed any modification of the hop duty. He also strongly denounced the Ilaynooth grant, and was averse from any concession whatever to the Roman Catholics. OPPOSiTION TO T11E INcOMIE-TtX.-At a meeting of the inhabitants of Barnsley, on Monday evening, to adopt measures for the remission of the income-tax, the following resolution was carried unanimously:-" That the income-tax is unjust in its application, oppressive in its execution, and offensive in its inquisitorial system. That while the nation generaUy seemed cheerfully to submit to an increased tax in support of the war its continuance after the termination of hostilities cannot bat be regarded as a breach of good faith; and in the opinion of this meeting the tax, from the present state of the revenue of the country, might be dispensed with altogether." It was also resolved to get up petitions against the tax. Mr. H. L. Seymer, M. P., writes to the Sherborne .Tour-nl in reference to some observations made by a local paver:-" I have accepted 'an appointment under Government' in the same sense as Mr. Walpole and Mr. Henley, members of Lord Derby's cabinet, have accepted appointments under the Government. I am an tnpaid commissioner for tho purpose of 'inquiring into the most effectual means of distributing the sewage of towns, and of applying it to beneficial and profitable uses.' I have yet to learn that a member of Parliament -who gratuitously devotes his services to the investigation of a comnplicated question, interesting alike to town and count ,fo eitsa thereby the goodwll and confidence of his constituents. I can assure your readers that my ' Government appointment' will not affezt my poelitical conduct-of this they will be able to .jadre when Parliament meets."
GENERAL CODRrNOTON AT WOOLWICH. Last night Lieutenant-General Codrington, in the oourns of bis canvass, met the electors and other inhabitants of Woolwich for the first time, in the Lecture-haU of the Literary Institution there, which was densely crowded. Ais at Deptford and Greenwich, in the earlier part of the week, he expounded his political viewsto the meeting; but, beyondt the announcement he made at the outset of the proceedins which elicited general cheers-that he meant advisedito abstain from canvassing tho electors in either the, Arsenal or the Dockyard there, connected as he was with the navy by family ties and with the army by position and profession, lest by any possibility that part of the constituency should feel itself under any restraint-there was nothing of novelty in his address, which was almost of necessity a repetition of those he had delivered in otherparts of the borough. Hewas, however, for upwards of an hour subjected to an incessant cross-fire of interrogatories. touching u,pon almost every conceivable point of the political compass, from individual members of the audience, some of them evidently hostile to him; and, as will be seen, he was especially called upon toivndicate the practice of flogging in the army, and tco state his reasons for opposing vote by ballot. To do the gaUant Genieral justice, he displayed the greatest good humour, and frankly, and without the slightest evasion answered every question that was propounded to him wliile in this kind of pilory, in which he was so mercilessly pelted in the cour5e of the proceedings. Mr. TUFFIELD, a local preaoher, addressing Sir William, said he had lived in Woolwicb, which was essentially a military town, during the time of two commandants, the latter of whom, now there, had resorted to the abominable system of floggmg to a far greater extent than his -Edecessor. He (Mr. TufDield) was sure he spoke the opimitis of a majority of the meeting when he said that they felt that the odious practice of flegging should be wholly abolished being entirely un-English, cruel, and unnecessary. (Cheers.; If the lash was considered to be indispensable by some, as. he knew it was, in governing large bodies of men, he would ask such persons why it was not resorted to in the civil affairs of the country? He bad to inquire of the General whether he was prepared to support the entire abolition of that unnecessary evil? (Cheers.) General CODRINGTON said, the gentlemau who had pat. that=qestion to him had compared military to civil life in reference to the practice of flogging. Did that gentleman allow that that there should be such a thing as a Mutiny Act at all? Was an army in the field to be governed bh a civil code? (A Voice.-" The French don't flog.") But. they shoot. (Cheers.) Was the meeting prepared to put the discipline of the army under a mere civil law ? (" No, no !") Very well; granted. We had a strong aud necessary means of keeping up the spirit of discipline in the army by courts-martial. It was absolutely necessary that we should have a separate judicature for the army and navy from that which was applicable to civil affairs. There, could be no doubt about that. The gentleman who had interrogated him called flogging in the army " an unnecessary evil." lie (General Codrington) also called it an evil, but a necessary one. (" No, no !') It was very well to cry "No, no, 'but what was the substitutt that they had to suggest? He had never yet heard of a remedy for thatwhich, he repeated, was an unavoidable eviL It was necessary to keep the soldier in a state of discipline, and experience had shown all military men that there were occasions and cases in which that could not be done without having recourse to a remedy the necessity for which he deplored as keenly as any man then hearing him, (Uproar and cheers.) ar. .UFFIELD rejoineu that the army was composed of tro classes of men-an aristocracy and a democracy; and if, wben a private soldier committed a breach of discipline, he were tried byhis peers, who were his feUow.soldlers in the ranks, instead of by officers, appointed not by mert, but by purchase, he would have a better chance of taining fair play than at present. He therefore contended it was high time some change shonld be introduced in the mode of tryin and punishing a soldier. General CODRLSGTOX Eaid, the military life was totally different to the civil, and he would defy anyone to prove the contrary. (A cry-" Why not flog officers?") He had heard that said before; but it was a miserable argume,t. He granted that an officer who might do aught to deserve that punishment vwas not fit to be in the army; but he defied them to find an officer in the army who aeserved to be flogged. (Cheers and renewed uproar.) In reply to a working-man named RICHARD., who contended for vote by baUot as essentiaUy necessary to protecthis order in the exercise of the elective franchise, General CODRINGTON said, he shouldconsider it a prouder thing to be returned to the HIouse of Commons by open ratherthan by secret voting, though Mr. Richardsheld, ashe was fairly entitled to do, a directly opposite opinion. He, (General Codringten) held, in common with most men, that there should be no coercion, intimidation, or unfair influence exercised over a voter in the disposal of bis franchise. The suggestion that the ballot was un-Enghsh was little or nothing in the argument; the main point to be abtained was the freedom of the vote. He thought the voter was, to a certaint extent, amenable, not only to himself, in the exercise of his franchise, but also to the publie opinion of the class to which he belonged, whatever that might be. (Hear, hear.) He would apply that observation to an elector in any rank of life. l was the pressure of public opinion among a man's own class which exercised an influence for good over his conduct; and if his companions were deprived of the knowledge of how he disposed of his vote a great security would be withdrawn, which now operated in the exercise of the franchise for the public weaL (Hear, hear.) Mr. RICIrA:DS said, he believed the General was as honest a man as he himself was (laughter); but he did not know the kind of influence which was practised on working men every day of their lives. General C(DnrIo.Tos, in reply to another question, briefly defended the grant to Maynooth. The meetinjg, at which Mr. Hudson presided, then separated, and the General was afterwards escorted to the rail-. way station, on his return to town, by a band of music and the principal members of his committee. It ought to be stated that Mr. Sleigh addressed a lare meeting of the inhabitants of Woolwich, at which Mr. E. Murray was chairman, in the same place on Tuesday evening, and that at the conclusion of his speech, on the motion of Dr. Moore, seconded by Mr. Tnflield, the audience passed a resolution pledging themselves to support him at the election, expressing at the same time an oDinion that it behoved the electors as Enghlshmen, to use the words of the motion, " in selecting a representative to show to an aristocratic oligarchy, who would attempt to coerce their opinion by the improper use of Government influence, that they wiU no longer tolerate such principles of political serfdom."
FOSSILS. TO TFIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -The transference of a paragraph about fossils from a local paper into your wide-world publication has overwhelmed me with applications for them, having had about70 in 24 hours, which it is imponsible to attend to at once. I purpose sending them off as widely as I can, and, in the meantime allow me to say that there are specimens to be seen in the Geological Museum in Jermyn-street, whither I sent them a week ago. Yours trulv. W. STO WE. BaWcnghaln, Jan. S.
MR. THACKERAYS LECTURES. TO TEIE EDITOlt OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I trust you wiUl in justice admit a few words in reply to the attack on the Marylebone Literary Institution, signed "Theta," in your impression of this day. I regret that "Theta" suffered any inconver4ence, but this did not arise from mismanagement, as he aUeges, but from the great anxiety of the public to obtain admission. Every precaution had been taken to prevent the overcrowding of the theatre, but after the seats were filled many persons requested, as a favour, to be allowed standing room. This was granted tW a limited extent, and only six persons had occasion to apply for a return of their money. If" Theta" will favour me with his card I shaU be happy to send him a reserved seat for the Saturday course of Mr. Thackeray's lectures (which wiU take place on the 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st), by way of compensation for his disappointment. I ani. Sir. vour obedient servant. .TA(I.OR RT..T.T. President. 17, Edward-street, Portman-Fquaro, Jan. 8.
THE /A TE ACCIDENT IN CO1NHILZ. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir.-I happened to be passing the premises in Cornhill when the accident to the poor fellow occurred, and shall not soon forget the pale and ghastly look of the unforttunate man who was mortally hurt; he appeaved to be a working man. It is probable he has ieft a wife and family destitute. If so, Idoubt not the Messrs. Sarl, wbo have the reputation of piety as well as wealth, will feel it their duty to provide for them. I should not now trespass on yottr space but to contrast the vigilance of the city autborities in small matters with their culpable neglect of things which affect the safety of the lives of thousands. A short time since a neighbour was compelled by the Commissioners of Sewers to take down a tablet a few inches in length which projected some 10 feetfrom the ground over his door, while enormous lamps and huge reflectors remain unmolested. The Messrs. Sarl still continue to keep their dangerous thoroughfare open under their scaffolding without let or hinderance, to the imminent risk of life and limb of every unwary person who passes underneath. I remain vour n1Ai- i, SAMUEtL HALL. 60, Voultry.
THE ACCIDENT TO THE POrNT OF AYR LIrEBOAT. -LIVERrOOL, Jan. 8.-At the weekly meeti g. of theI Liverpool Dock Committee this afternoon a reph?X'relatinz to the accident of the Point of Ayr lifeboat and the loss 0o her crew was received from Lieutenant Parkes, the marine, surveyor of the port, which, however, revealed no neow facts. In the course of the discussion which followed it was stated by Mr. Charles Tnrner the chairnman, that themenproferred the boats of the D;ock Committee to any other; that on the occasion of the disaster the men had no lifebelts with them, tb^y having an objection to their use on the suppositionthattheY interfered withthb actionof the chest. andarns; thatthe menwere all ,ickedsen,havingbeenpaid extra wages from Iloylake. that most of them had been in. the service of the Dock Coinmittee from IS to 30 years; and that every time they went out 19 the assistance of a vessel they received 7s. 6d. each in'addition to their wages. It was ultimately resolved. on the proposition of the chairman, that the sum of 500?. should be givan towards the relief.fund, which nowv xaounts to about l,300f. Inansweer to Mr. Robertson Gladstone, the chairman stated that the boav, which wras considered to be one of the best in the service, wvouhi be at Liverpool next weeke, when it could be exansined.
