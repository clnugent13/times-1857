Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONRY-MA7TRTandI CITY INTELLIGB.YVIEi.
Thursday Evening. i The English funds have been steady to-day, antd have closed, at a slight advance. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 93i to i, were first. quoted 93f, and the last official prices were 93g t, j
for money, and 94 to J for the 5th of Febr'uary.
After regular hours there were sellers for the! account at 94. The firmness of the market during ! the morning was attribuitable chiefly to a purchase
of o5,0001. Reduced by the Government brokers for! the Commissioners for the Reduction of National' Debt, on account of life arnnities, and to the circumstance of a considerable amount having been lent on stock by another house at 6 per cent. Bank Stock closed at 216 to 217i ; Reduced, 94 to i; New Three per Cents., 94i to {; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 99; India Bonds, is. dis. to 3s. premiura; and Exchequer-bills, is. dis. to 2s. premium.
The money-market was without alteration, an active demand being generally observable.
Foreign securities exhibited firmness, but the operations were unimportant. A fair amount of business was, however, transacted, and most descriptions were to some extent dealt in. 'Tirkish Six per Cents., for money, 'were negotiated at 95 ; for the accoumt 956 ; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 103i; Venezuela, for account, 30 ; and the Deferred, 14j ; Grenada Deferred, 6i- Guatemala, 59; Mexican Three per Cents., 21.; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for aecount, 78i; Portugiuese Three per tents., 43j ; Russian Five per Cents., 107i; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95i ; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89; Spanish Three per Cents., 40j; and the Newv Deferred, 23k.
About 32,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank
to-day for the purchase of silver on the continent.|
The closing quotations of the French Three per
Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening vwereI 67f. 76c. for money and 67f. -5ec. forthe end of the month, showing no materialfalteration. It is stated that the preparations for the half-monthly settlement are going on well, the rates of interest for carrying over purchases being rather lower.
The Paris letters to-day mention that owing to the late unfavourable alteration in the Indian exchanges, silver five-franc pieces are being eagerly bought up for transmission to London. In other respects there was no particular movement. It has been intimated that Count de Morny is about to withdraw from all public financial undertakings. M. M.res this morning has advertised for subscriptions for the Spanish Loan of 3,000,0001. recently contracted. he mentions that the contract price was 42f. 66c., but that he abandons the commission allowed him of 3 per cent., and the coupon of 1i due on the 31st ult., and contents himself with a commission of i~ per cent. The atock is therefore offered at 38f. 66c.; 20 per cent. deposit is to be paid on application, but no guarantee is given that if prices should improve before the aUotment takes place the full amount applied for will be granted. The invitation for tenders is addressed to the people of Amsterdam and London, as wel as of Paris, but as no agents are named in the two former cases it may be conjectured that respectable houses could not be found willing to be the medium of putting forth fresh securities on behalf of a Government stained like that of Spain with every species of financial infamy.
At a half-yearly meeting of the London Joint-
Stock Bank held to-day, Mr. P. W. Flower pre- I siding, a dividend of 61. Bs. per cent. for the six months (being at the rate of 12i per cent. per anniim), together with a bonus of 1os. 6d. per share, makuig altogether a distribution equal to 25O per cent. per annum, was declared, and the report and accounts were adopted. The whole of the discussion was congratulatory, and votes of confidence to thei
directors and manager were immediately carried. I The only question raised was with regard to the valuation of the public securities held by the bank, which it was stated is taken at the price of the day on which the accounts are nmade up. Annexed are the report and statement:-
" With much satisfaction the directors again meet the proprietors of the bank to place before them the state of their affairs, and the profit and loss account for the halfyear ending the 31st of December, I185.

According to returns just received of the wines
despatched at the Custom-house of Oporto last year, the shipments were 41,021 pipes against 34,380 pipes in 1855. This shows a larger export than might have been expected after the late disastrous vintages, but it is attributed to the fact of the trade keeping up their supplies in anticipation of advanced prices. Of these shipments 29,216 pipes were sent to tlhe united kingdom, ,611 to Brazil, 1,813 to the Unit d States, 2,257 to lHamburg and the Baltic, 650 to ports in Portugal, and 1,068 to other ports. The principal shippers were-Sanderman and Co., 3,327 pipes; Cockburn and Co., 2,507; Martinez and Co 2,009; Offley and Co., 1,848; J. D. Harris, 1, 570

The following letter from the River Plate gives on the whole an encouraging account of theprogress both of Montevideo and 'Buenos Ayres. In the fonner place sheep and cattle farming is proceedin' at a-rate that has doubled the price of land within 'a short period, and apparently nothino- is wanting but a stea y continuance of imrnigration to cause a stil more rapid development. At Buienos Ayres, owing to the high prices of produce in Europe, the signs of increasingwvtealthi are everywhere observable:
"Montevideo, Deo. 4, 1856.
"The election of senators, which came off here a fewf days ago, terminated in favour of the Government, and it is believed this will turn out to be the case generally throughout the country. Oribe put forth all his strength and craftiness, for he selected a candidate who, had he been supported by the Government, would have scarcely ncountered any opposition. Many of the votes that were giv n in favonor of r. Castellanos (Oribe's candidate) were by his personal friends, who were by no means friends of Oribe. As the senators elect their own president or chairman, who in the event of the death of the President of the Republic assumes his rank and authority by law, the importance of having a majority of senators who are not mere naominees of that curse of his country may be conceived. I am sorry to say that Oribe's influence is yet considerable, although much diminished since the advent of the President Pereira, and, with proper management, may ere long dis-
appear altogether. The country is becom ing p ro6us Land has doubled in price within 18 ths. Sheep farm-
ing continues to be very popular, and seep are being con. stantly imported from Buenos Ayres. Cattle are incresein and it is estmated there a-re now about 2,500,000 in the country. The high price of cattle is augmenting the wealth of the cstancicrs. ialf-aa-dozen saladerorwllsbeatworkthin season, and 150,000 head of cattlejare said to have been contracted for. A well regulated and well-sustained stream of European immigration would rapidly develope the wealth
of this country to the advantage of both capitaliss anl immigrants. The wheat crop, which as now ripening, Ls considered to be very abundant, and anothef
,yevr of peace will termapate in leaving Mntevideo one
b'etrteri a prosperous condition, It the Govirjinint
p comprehended its real functions, and the native pfe°rvo v.ouldturn their hands to ioduastrialparsuits,instead
isting after official sinecures and. jlaces, prosparity ivould.be rapid. Peculation, however, is still the rule from. high to low. The Custom-house does not produce tho revenues it might) because the Governmtnt were desirous of keeping their friends in office, and they row- rather oppose than aid the Administration in the execution of its duties. The revenue should be one-four%h to one-third more than it is at present. The President's good intentions are nullified. In fact, there is an evident desire to resume the Administration themselves, and it is only the fear of consequences that deters them from perpetrating a coup d'Vtat. Their ungracious and unaccountable suspension of the French contract will, it is generally believed, be attended with serious consequences, as soon as the French Governmentfnlly comprehends it. Wts to be hoped LmuisNapaleon's Government will bring these faithless peop'e to their senses. Exchange 42.d. to id.
" Buenos Ayres continues to pro-ress in peace and p -sperity. The high price of produce Tas enormously ade l to the wealth of tbe country. Carria-es are becoming as common there now as in Europe. HanA&ome houses aTe rising in every direction. The railway to San Josa will £ooa be c r,npleted, and the carriages are expected out from E3gland in the course of a month or two. Filtered river water is to be supplied to residences by a company. The new Custom Eouse is beginning to wear an imnposing aspect, and evea the benefits of the mole are actually enjoyed, and a new one is talked of where the first should have been constructed. The city is vell lighted with gas, and it is becoming the practice to introduce it into private residences. Bat the town wants well paving, and roads radiating from it to thle various parts of the country require to be made. D arin" the winter so impassable was the state of the so-cdlea roads that the Buenos Ayreans imported beef from M1ontevideo! All eyes are directed to the forthcoming election of Governor, as it is believed it will mainly depend upon him wvhether Buenos Ayres will re-enter the confederation or nct. As the period approaches when the Argentine law of differential duties will come into operation people be-iin to get uneasy. It is not difficult, however, to foresee tTlat it cannot last long, and that the principal sufferers will be the Argentines themselves. But, as it waS a politic il measure, at is not easy to understand why Montevideo Should have been placed in the samee position as Buenos Ayres, when Urquiza professes to be its friend and protector."
A company has been formed, under the Limited Liability Act, for working Dr. Normandy's patent apparatus for producing pure, fresh, anrated water from seawater. The apparatus is similar to that erected by the Government at Heligoland last summer for the use of the Foreign Legion, and it is also in use in this country for manufacturiDg purposes. It is alleged to be the only machine that will produce water properly aerated for drinking, and that the consumption of fuel for doing so is only one-half of that used in ordinary stiLLs.
A comparison has been prepared of the imports of wines and spirits in the year 1855, as published bv the Board of Trade, with those of the year 1835 showing the results of an interval of 20 years. In 1835, according to this statement, the total importation of wine was 9,039,551 gallons, while that of 1855 was only 8,946,766, showing a decrease of 92,785 gallons. The total quantity of spirits imported in 1835 was 7,980,717 gallons; that of 1855 being 10,743,259; showing an increase of 2,762,542 gallons. The total amount of revenue paid on both wines and spirits was in 1835 4,738,8811., and in 1855 4,242,5621., showing a decrease of 492,3191. Thus, the total increase in the importation of wines and spirits, during this period, for the united kingdom, scarcely exceeds 15 per cent., while there is a large falling off in the revenue collected. The latter circumstance is accounted for partly by a reduction in the duty of 22s. Gd. to 16s. per gallon on brandy, and partly by the falling off in the importation of wines. The increase in the importation of spirits in the outports has been considerable, while that in the port of London has not been eaual to 10 per cent. The
expense incurred in the collection and assessment of s this branch of the revenue in the latter port hai, however, it is said, increased more than 140 per cent. since 1835; and a proposal is now alleged to have been made for a further addition to this outlay. In comparing the returns of the year 1855 with those of 1790, being an interval of 65 years, the extraordinary fact presents itself tbat there is a faUing off of 1,440,249 gallons in the total quantities of wines and spirits entered for home consumption. In brandy alone the falling off-making dae allowance for the difference of measurement-has been more than 400,000 galons. Thus, while the importations of tea, sugar, coffee, cocoa, spices, fruits, such as currants, raisins, and plums, and other necessaries of life, have increased from 100 to 150 per cent., the consumption of foreign spirits has decreased very considerably.
The following is from the Euphrates Valley Railway Company *-
' Extract from a telegraphic despatch, received through the Foreign-office to-day by 3Ir. Andrew from General Chesney, dated Pera, the 14th of January, 1857:-' Saturday is fixed for signing the Euphrates Concession. The Sult and several of the Porte take shares in the railway. "
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a further adjournment of the case of Mr. S. Adams, of the Hertford and Ware Bank, took place, to allow time for the investigation of the accounts. It was stated that the assets in hanad are sufficient to pay a dividend of 2s. Gd. in the pound. The estimate now is that the debts proveable against the estate wiU reach from 100,0001. to 120,0001., of which 90,0001. have already been admitted, and that the total realized assets will be 30,0001.
The latest telegraphic accounts received in the city this evening regarding the mail steamer Tyne were to the effect that everything was going on satisfactorily, although the weather had become less favourable. The hopes of getting her off were undiminished.
The Spanish Financial Commission have advertised an auction of the foreign redeemable debt, for which purpose 375,000 reals have been assigned by the Government.

The lace trade, although by no means active at present, is rather more buoyant, more particularly as respects the foreign demand, which is just now commencing. The home trade is dul. For plain goods there is a fair inquiry. The prospects of a good spring trade are cheering.
In hosiery there is a air amount of business doing; we have buyers in the market, both foreign and hoe, and ape. rations to some extent are being carried on. In most branches of the hosiery trade there is considerable activity for the period of the year, and hosiers are anticipating a busy season.
Silk and yarns are exceedingly high.
LIEICESTER, JT,. 15.
The hosiery trade is in a healthy condition. We expect soon to be able to report a further improvement, as shortly we may anticipate operations. Stocks in hand are very light, so that with a fair quantity of orders our market will be very active. Wools are seUling at an enormous price, and worsted yarns are exceedingly dear. The operatives, on the whole, are tolerably employed.

It appears the works on this lino are satisfactorily pro. gressing. The tunnels at Crevkwerne and Honiton are in course of formation. In the course of a few weeks the works on the line at Whipton, near Exeter, are to be commenced with a view to carry on the line towards Honiton, and facilitate the conveyance of materials from Topaham to the floniton tunnel.
LAINCASTER AND CARLTSLE.
A specal meeting of this company was held on Tuesday,
at Lancaster, to consider the propriety of authorizing the directors to apply to Parliament in the ensuing session for powver to construct-a railway from their line at IKendal to the North-Western Rallway at Ingleton, and also a branch therefrom ; Mr. E. W. IaseleU in the chair.
The Secretary having read th9 notice convening the meeting
The kumMt said it had always been the policy of the company to refrain from undertaking branch lines, but circumstances had arisen which rendered it necessary for them to make an exception to the general rule they had laid down, and thus for the present to depart from that policy to a certain extent. The aggressive acts of other comranies bad forced them to adopt that course in defence of their property. He concluded by moving a resolution sanctioning the course proposed by the directors in respect to the application to Parliament.
Ir. H. HOWtARD seconded the motion.
M1r. H. GARSNETT said, he thought the directors had talen a wise step, and the proprietors could not do better than leave it in their hands.
Mr. GILLOW also approved the course proposed to be adopted, and was of opinion that an expenditure of 300,0001., or even a larger sum, on the new branch, would be remunerative.
The resolution was thon carried unanimously, and a voto of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings,

Art Treasures Exhibition.
AB1 TIWASURBS EXHIBr!erof.
The Public. will learn with Pleasure that Hler Majes'7, has jpermitted the folowing selection to be zmade. from the works of medieval art in the ROYI collections at;. Windsor Castle and other of the Royal residences. The selection has been mado (under the direction of Mr. J. B. Waring> not so much to exhibit the wealth of the RoYal collections as to ilustrato by rare and select specimens those peculiarperiods and styles of art of which examples of eq;al i*aportance have not as yet been contributed to the Exhivi. tion.
From among the many precious objects of the Royal gold. plate closet the committee have chosen some beautiful cup; formed from the graceful nautilus shell, the more remarkable one being a ltrge shell, superbly set in gold, on whichk is represented the " Triumph of Neptune," aLnd another. smaller one. of very graceful composition, in which the cup. is supported bg a kneeling fire.
The ivory cups, very fne specimens of carving, are equally remarkable. Of these we may mention as about tobe exhibited the very elegant cup supported by the three Graces, known to every connoisseur in this department of art, together with its companion cup, borne on the shoulders of Atlas. These superb works of their kind are nearly two' feet in height. But perhaps even more interesting thaa. these will be the two fiue goblets with carvings of Bacchanalian subjects by tho celebrated Fiammingo. These arealso of rnagnificent dimensions, and will afford the Exhibition an admirable cxamnple of art in ivory carving.
Of the jewelled plate witl appear a splendid slver gilt; tankard, enrichedOr witli cameos and precious stones; also a, ciystal goblet, adorned with jewels.
From treasures scarcely less imiportant some noble piece. have been selected-finu cups with covers of the tine of Cbarles I. and Charles IL, some superb salvera anuOlishesin silver gilt, more especially a pair of circulat diss, ornamented with mytholo.ical subjects in repous6 work; v grand gold tankard, highly embossed, on which is represented a Bacchanalian subject, figures of satyrs forming thahandles; the shield preeented by the present King of Prussia, a fine rpecimen of goldsmith's art; a pair of superb silver gilt firo dogs, elaborately ornamented, anda hearing the Royal ciplher " C. R.. ;" the richly-chased and& ornamented Armada flagon: the renowned Celini Ehield - two silver tripods, fine works of the time, and remarkable as having been presented, together with a magnificent table, in sold silver, to King Charles II. by the city of London.
The illustration of art as applhed to personal ornainenbr will be very materially assisted by a selection of jewelry also contributed by Rer Majesty.
From the Royal Armoury will be forwarded a large assemblage of weapons and arms, offensive and defensive, forthe combat and the chase, ornamented with curiously wrought devices. The Oriental armsare particularlychoice, many of tbem richly jeweled and inlaid with every varietyof material and graceful ornament of Indian, Japanese, Persian, and IMloresque fancy. Most interesting to many will be the arms worn by Ti pIpoo abib, his sword with its gilt and. jiewelled hatndle and blade, together with its fixed gauntlet - Turkish cimetars, some with singular wvavy blades, anA
lahratta swords with fine enamelled ornaments; splendidt yataghans, worked with filigree; Persian swords enamelled. and jewelled in arabesque, with a variety of ingenious devices forming handles of animals' heads, having the blad
of Damascus work elaborately inlaid in gold and silver. The Scotch claymores and the long medieeval swords wilt be found very interesting objects- here will be a sword.
sbeath, worked by Benvenuto Ce1lini a Spanish knight's. sword; an old Covenanter's sword; the Elector of Brandenburg's sword, with portraits of the Princes of Orangeupon it. The old firelocks^, matchtocks, and wheellocks, one formerly belonging to the Farnese family, dated 1596, are objects of great antiquarian interest. Also a Mameluke'g gun set with coral and gilt.
Some curious Algerine and Turkish pistols by thechoicest artists of the time ; the various European
stamped with the maker's namnes, will form a series interesting to every one, and more especially important to the history and progress of the gunsmith's art.
From the armour a few choice examples have beeni selected, suclh as complete suits of steel,lemsbossed with gl1t; arabesques; some shirts of mail, and an East Indian suit of metal and velvet work; and this branch of the exhibitiors (tbe peaceful war department as it might be called) is made. stiUl more perfect by a selection of very bandsome acha. braques, or military saddle cloth-, chiefiy of Oriental work, amd a set of embroidered elephant trappings, richly worked with gold on crimson velvet.
From other apartments in the Castle, from AdeIaide-lodge, and Cumberland-lodge, many exquisite specimens of china. have been chosen, all so lovely thatitisdifficultto particulatize many. The selection has been made chiefly from the Oriental' porcelain, in which the Royal cabinets are extremely rich.
8ome of the most remarkable will be what are known to' connoisseurs as Chinese crackle'jars. Of these there are twc' in green, witb red landscapes on a white ground, 14 inches higl; two dark blue vases, covered with coloured flies ane. flowers, 18 inches in height; two bulbous-shaped Caledod, bottles, with lizard handles; a large sea-green bottle, 3 feet. high; two small sheU cups and saucers, with red twisted. handles and flies on a white ground; and some fine speci. mens of Oriental enamel on copper, together with exami les of Sevres, particularly a blue and white vase, and a casket plaque of Scvres, very finely painted. The old Chelsea is also very well represented; and there are some charmingr specimens of the Mayflower style of vase-one of which isbeautifully painted with paroquets and other birds.
In sculpture the Royal collection contributes a model of the Bucentaur, coloured and gilt; a beautiful statuette work of the 18th century, by Gottfried Turan ; als' a set of bronze plaques, "The Seasons," by Soldani, 1715, of large size, and some carvings in wood and ivory. In the latter a group representing Brahma and other deities, is a remarkable work of Oriental carving.
In furniture, as might justly be anticipated, some magnificent productions wil be contributed from Windsor Castle; and certainly there will be no disappointment in this very' attractive and fascinating walk of art as applied to domestic purposes,-some cabinets of master workmanship, made of every conceivable variety of colour or susceptibility of elegant form, such as the cabinet by Gautier in Iouis Quatorze style, in ormolu, superbly ornamented-a grand ebony cabinet -with figures in ormolu appliqu4, and one by Vernis Martin-fine old chairs carved in ebony, and Ven,.. tian gilt and embroidered in a style of luxury fit for the Doges. In addition to these fine things there are some beautiful caskets, Florentine pietra dura work in tortoiseshell, in malachite, and in Japanese lacquer work; some fine candelabra in bubl; a cabinet in the same kind of work, made for the Cardinal de Retz; carved and gilt arm chair' covered with Beauvais tapestry; a finely-carved mirror b Chippendale, a work of the 18th century; a table and mirror in marqueterie, with some fine clocks in buhl; and. an especially interesting relic, the celebrated Strawberryhill clock, presented to Anne Boleyn by Henry VIII.
Some remarkably fine pieces of tapestry will enable the exhibition to be most perfectly arranged in the departmen' of furniture. A large-sized Oriental carpet is a gorgeous example of Eastern magnificence; it is composed of crimson, velvet, embroidered with a broad border of silver and gold. With this most beautiful piece of work Her Majesty transmits a set of coverings for a state bed in Oriental work, elaborately ornamented with feathers and jewels.
The specimens thus liberaUy placed at the disposal of the, committee are nearly 5o0 in number, many of the most rare character, and many of a most fragile nature; but Her Miajesty, it will be seen, has every confidence in tne conscientious care that will be taken of every article by the porsons intrusted with their transmission to Manchester.

(n2Ox OUR OWN CORRESPONDENiT.)
[A portion of the followuing appeared in our second edi. ti0n of vesterdav:-1
PARIS, WEDNE-SDAY, JAN. 14, 6 P.M1.
A I elegraphic despatch from Berne, dated to-day, *rnounces that the Commission of the Natioslal 'Council had approved unanimously the propositgon 'to set at liberty the Neuchh±el prisoners, and, fat She Commission of States approved it unanimously, less c?.e vote.
A subsequent despatell states that the discussion of the proposition by the Federal Assembly has been rostponed till to-morrow, the 15th. This is the date -on -which the delay fixed by Prussia for the military
?novemient expires.
The foUowing despatches have also been re-ceived
*BERNE, JAN. 13.
"The message of tho Federal Council to the Federal .Assembly proposes to discontinue the law proceedings com'nenced against the Royalist prisoners of Neuchatel, and to *Cecree their liberation, on condition of their leaving the -$erritory of the Helvetic Confederation until after the *vfficial conclusion of the arrangement. The same doctment !proq<ps to suspend the armaments, and to send the troops to thdrt homes. The message announces that the Mtinisters 4Df Austria and Russia at Berne have communicated to the ;Federal Council notes in conformity vwith those of France -and England."
"BERLIN, JALN. 13, EVEN'ING.
" The Yeiv Pr-ussian Gazete positively der;es that Prussia 'bs contracted any other engagement than that of entering luto diplomatic negotiations on the affair of Neuchaitel as :woot asthe prisoners shall have been set at liberty uncondltionally. It adds, that no great Power has requested any other promise."
The New Prussian Gazette, as well as the Paris M51inisterial papers, are evidently anxious to save -he oricsr pr''Cn'e of the Ring of Prussia.
Political life, which seemed to be completely ex-inct in France, begins to show signs of another -wakening. Freedom has not died, but was only in a trance. The question of the unrestricted circula'lion of the electoral voting papers (bulletins), which is now before the Court of Cassation, seems to recall the country to its old instincts. For some time past both the bar and the press have been occupied with it, and the approach of the general elections to the Legislative Corps, which is near the legal term *of its existence, invests it with some importance.
The question is this,-whether, in case of election .either for the Legislative Corps, for a Council General, or a Municipal Council, each citizen has the right to distribute the usual voting tickets in-
csclibed with the name of the candidate of his choice; or whether the simple fact of such distribution, -without the previous authorization of the Prefect, -constitutes an infraction of the law of the 27th July, 1849, relative to what is termed the colportje _the hawking, that is, of books, pamphlets, &c.
The question had for years past raised no difficulty whatever, nor even a difference of opinion. Electoral -voting tickets, bearing the names of candidates, were freely distributed until some time in 1855, 'when a prosecution was instituted in an obscure ccnmmine, and then, for the first time, the right of -the free circulation of the voting-tickets was called in question. In the month of August of that Zear, and on the occasion of the election of 13 mumicipal councillors in the commune of St. Just -(Puy-de-Dome), three electors distributed, as usual, a 3ist on which were inscribed the names of candidates 'vho had the disadvantage of not being the choice of the local officials. A nminute, or psocds-verbal, was 'drawi up by the competent authority, and the 'three electors in question were cited before the Correctional Tribunal of Puy, the prinzipal town, or chef liciq, of the department, on .; charge of having, without the authorization of -the Prefect previously obtained, caused to be ciraculated printed productions-co01or'ti des iqnpriris. S'he Court was of opinion, and it is difflicult to un'derstand howr it could be otherwise, that voting tickets had no affinity to productions fcrits, the circulation of which required the previous authority of the Prefect.
The law officer of the Government appealed frcm ihat decision to the Court of Riom (Puy-do-Dome); the Court of Riom confirmed the judgment of the Court of Puy. The law officer appeaaled to the Court *ef Cassation; the Court of Cassation annulled tii,e
judgment, and sent the question to the Court of zlyons. The Court of Lyons decided as the Tribunal of Puy and the Court of Riom had done, and Zs the Courts of Aix and Amiens had also done in -analogous cases. It acquitted the defendants, and decided that the circulation of voting tickets did not require previous permission.
The indomitable law officer of the Crown did not -sve up the contest. He has once more appealed -from the lower Courts, and the Court of Cassation, 'with all its chambers assembled together, has the affair now under consideration, and will be called upon to decide on the interpretation that ought to be given to the law of the 27th July.
The law of the 27th July (clause 6) specifies that 11 distributols or hawkers (colporteurs) of books (&crits), pamphlets, &c., must have the previous =authorization of the Prefect. The question, therefore, is, whether voting tickets, or bldletins electorauli-
are to be assimilated to printed works, as comprised in the term fc?its, in the sense, meaning, and language of the law. So far as the judgments of ,eminent lawyers carries weight3-the affair is in fact -already decided in favour of the full exercise of the -freedom of the electors. An opinion, or consultatiise, to that effect has been drawn up by an advocate of the Court of Cassation, and to this opinion haave adhered some of the most learned and ablest members of the Paris bar, among whom we find such men as Odillon Barrot, Dufaure, Berryer, Senart, Cr6mieux, Marie, Jules Favre, B6chard, and -others. It is said that the President of the Council of State himself, M. Baroche, who has given so many pledges to the Government, is of the same opinion; and, if we may judge from his late circular to the prefects, it would appear that M. Billault, the Minister of the Interior, takes pretty much the same view of the question. These gentlemen think that the law of the 27th July was initended to place on a regular footing the trade -and practice of hawking books and pamphlets, but not to affect the incidental and isolated distribution of a voting ticket containing nothing more than the name of a candidate. It remains now to be seen whether the Court of Cassation, met in full -chamber, will decide against such authoriteisas above alluded to, or confirm the right of candidates to openly announce their pretensions, and that of electors to distribute their election tickets freely. The *question will be decided in a few days. The whole -*f thie Paris bar intend appearing, and thus testifying by their presence their adhesion to the com;dUatios,. It will be, in fact, a tacit protest, which wi]l hardly fail to have weight with the Court, and M hich it will find difficllt to disregard. In anticipa-tion of a favourable decision meetings of electors bave been already held in order to come to an unIerstanding as to the line they should follow at the approaching elections for the new Legislative 'Corps. The principle has been already adrmitted -hat the whole of the electors should be requested to vote, that no one should abstain, and that electoral committees should be formed with the object of *nlightening the electors on the choice of their candidates. If these resolutions are maintained, and if they are not interfered with by the Govern^ment, we may expect to see in the new Chamber a certain number of the Opposition of the precedinlg Governments. The Legislature has been treated rather cavalierly, to say the least, by the Govern-nent. It was thought hardly necessary to stand on ceremony with the " silent and satisfied ;" but the -case now threatens to be different. Of course, the
uovernment desires to see its old complacent fri'end.s in their places. His diplomatic and speculative duties retain M. de M orny, President of the 'Chamber, still at St. Petersburg; but some of his colleagues of the Legislative Corps have been inlormed through another channel that they are at liberty to solicit those little favours so £co&on in the time of Louis Philippe, and -WI& are of 3 nature to gain the goodwill Df those who have influence more or less direct *.ver the flock of electors. Les petits cadeaux ewtretienuewnt 'amitiA, and the electors will be hardhearted indeed if they resist Wbreau= de tabac,
posts in the Excise, pictures for churches or townballs, and various other little douceurs tending to excite devotion.' The Government possess too many means of action to entertain any serious fear *of the result, or to apprehend a hostile majority in the departments. I should hesitate, however, as yet to affirm the same of Paris.
I have just heard that the Prefects have received 5nstructions to allow the unrestricted circulation of the voting tickets, in consequence of the demonstration of the Paris bar, and that these functionarie
replied'that, if they did so, they could not answer for the Parliamentarymajority.
A letter from Milan, of-the 8th inst., contains some further particulars relative to the temporary exile of the young Count Emilio Dandolo from that city. The Director of Police read to the young man a written speech, in which it was said that Count Dandolo had not reformed, but that he was the chief of a society of young men who endeavour to prevent the nobility from attending the Court, and that consequently he was exiled to the country. He was given his choice of several districts, and he selected Adro, in the district of Iseo. On his arrival there, he vwas compelled to present himself to the chief magistrate, and he is not to quit Adro. The Director of Police added-."When the times become more tranquil you may ask to retura to Milan. In the meantime you have but 24 hours to prepare to depart for the residence assigned to you." This conversation took place on the 3d inst. The result of this measure is that public opinion is more decided to abstain from all demonstrations and to maintain a calm and freezing attitude. Such is the programme, which is to be observed to the letter. The young Count Seranzo, late aide-de-camp to the Duke of Genoa, and who thought proper to go to Venice to pay his compliments to the Emperor, will not return to Milan, as he knows he has lost many friends by his journey, and that several have determined never to greet him.
it is stated that the Admiral who is to cormmand the French squadron in the China Seas has received orders from the Government to be ready to embark at Brest on the 25th inst.
The Consul-General, who is on leave in Paris, has also been ordered to prepare to return to his post immediately.

CONSTAINTINOPLE, Jair. 5.
On Saturday last, the 3d inst., another conference on the firman concerning the convocation of the Divans ad hoc in the Danubian Principalities took place at the British Embassy, in wlhich all the remaining points were discussed and settled. The first point entered upon was, I hear, the representation of the peasants who are not freehold proprietors.
This was the most important modification proposed by the French Ambassador, the Turkish project having only proposed to give a right of representation to the peasants who are freehold proprietors. In the abstract certainly nothing can be more just than to give a representation to the most numerous class of inbabitants, wvho have, moreover, to support nearly the whole burden of taxation, but the question was how to arrive at practical results in this representation. This seemed impossible, as long as the principle subsisted that each class was to be represented by members belongiug to that class, for what could one expect from a number of ignorant and easily intimidated peasants, except that they should fall a prey to the first bold agitator who came forward, or else that they ishould be entirely in the hands of the great proprietors ?
The last conference, if I am correctly informed, upset this prineiple, not only as regards this cla s of peasants, but likewise that of the freehold proprietors and the town population, and allowed them to choose their members from the other classes. If this be the case, there is some chance that the intelligence of the country will obtain a share in the representation, from which it had been practically excluded by the principle of class representation.
The latter part of the firman, concerning the election of the Presidents and Secretaries of the Divans, as well as of the power of veto asked for the Turkish Commissary in case the Assembly attempt to discuss any questions contrary to the rights of the Porte, caused much less difficulty than was anticipated, the Turkish Government having given in on both these points.
The Porte, as you will remember, desired that the President and the Secretaries should be named from among the members of the Divan by the Kaimalans; the Conference decided that the Metropolitan should be President ad honsrem, and that. the Vice-President, who would de facto direct the deliberations of the Divan, and the five Secretaries, one for each class committee, should be elected by the Divan by a majority of votes.
This is a kind of compromise, for as the President, according to the Turkish project, is to be the organ of communication between the Divans and the Commission, it was important that he should occupy as much as possible an independent position, which should insure the impartiality of his reports to the Commission. If the original plan were adhered to, and be should be named by the Kaimakans, he would be entirely in the hands of the latter; if, on the contrary, he be chosen by the majority of the Divan, there might be an apprehension lest he should be too much influenced by those who chose him. By choosing the Metropolitan as President and the organ of communication with the Commission, and'leaving the direction of the debates in the Divan to the Vice-President, elected by a majority of votes, the freedom of discussion in the Divan, as well as an impartial organ of conimunication with the Commissioners, seems to have been sufficiently secured by the Conference.
The last paragraph of the firman, asking for a veto for the Turkish Commissary in case the Divans attempted to enter into questions contrary to the rights of the sovereignty of the Porte, hasbeen simply omitted. The paragraph, as every one could see, was intended to prevent all discussion in the Divans on the question of union, but in reality, by its vagueness, it could have been made into the moAt efficient means of preventing all discussion, and thus defeating the whole object of the Divans and the Commission. The relative position of the Principalities and Turkey is in itself very vague, and has always varied according to the means Turkey possessed at any given moment to enforce her will on the other side of the Danube. Before Russian influence began to counterpoise the power of Turkey in the Danubian Principalities her power was nearly absolute, and Moldo-Wallachia was to all intents
and purposes just as much a Turkish pasbalie as Adrianople or rouss; so there would have been lenty of opportunity for preedents. The late
ini8try might, therefore, have been sure from the beginning that the last paraoraph of the firman would not pass the Conferences.
As Redsc4id Pasha declared that he did not think the Porte had the right of preventing the Prineipalities from giving an opignimo on any subject short of a wish for separation, which would be contrary to the treaty itself, which declares the Danubian provinces integral parts of Turkey, he offered no objection to the annulling the last paragraph. Of course, the opinion of the Divans is only an opinion, not a decision ; it folns only one side of every question, while the rights of Turkey, the interest of the whole empire, and, above all, the consideration of how best to insure a stronog Government in the Principalities and render them independent of foreign influence, form the other side, and between them the Conference at Paris will have to decide.
On Wednesday next I am told there will be a last conference for the revision of the whole fizman as it stands now, and, after this conference, the mixed conferenees will begin, in which the Comm8isioners are to take part. By the latter end, then, of this month everything here will be ready for the departure of the Commissioners for the Principalities. Indeed, I hear they are waiting for instructions to that effect. They will, of course, depend on the decision taken about the evacuation of the ceded territory by the Rus-

Persons lately arrived fronZ the Principalities an4, weU acquaiDted with the po,tiOXL of- the Au!strian troops in Moldavia-aud W'ah-iZ saty that it will require about a month. to withtar,w the Austrian troops. The end of January and the 1niiith of February wvuld be the most convenient time, lof during those two months, which are the real winter months in those parts, the roads are hardened by frost, while in March aud April the enows begin to melt, and the state of the roads becomes such as to make the march of an army an affair of serious difficulty. The Austrians must, then, either evacuate by March or else wait till May.
We are still uncertain about the fate of the new bank. To the telegraphic despatch sent by Messrs. Wilkins to Loridon hitherto only an answer has been received from the solicitor of the company, approving the arrangement accepted by those gentlemen, but the opinion of the financiers interested in the affair has not yet arrived.
A newv railway project has been taken up by the Turkish Govermnent lately; it is Mr. Layard's. He proposes a railway connecting the Danube and the Black Sea with the Archipelago, sending out by degrees branches to the capital and the principal towns of Roumelia and Bulgaria. The railway would start from the Danube, either at Rustchuk- or Silistria, and pass by Shumla and Adrianople to Enos, or any other point in the Archipelago which should offer the advantages of a large and sure harbour.
This project invites the greatest attention, for it is based on a thorough knowledge of the country, and is therefore best calculated to draw out the resources of European Turkey. It differs from all other projects having reference to the country on this side of the Straits, as it proposes the shortest artery of communication between the West and East, and Iwould be sure to become the great high road
through Turkey. It would effect a revolution in the whole export trade, by placing the great harbour of European Turkey in the Archipelago, dispensing thus with the delays of months to which vessels are exposed in passing the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, and doing away with the dangers of the Danube and Black Sea navigation. Most of the produce of the Danubian Principalities, of Bulgaria and Roumelia, and even of Hungary and Transylvania, which is now sent to Brailow, Galatz, and down the Danube, or to Varna and Bourgas, on tho Black Sea, would be certain to take this rotite. But, besides the trade already existing, this line would be sure to lead to a great increase of exports from Roumelia, the fertile ulains of which have now no outlet except Constantinople, and this is sO expensive that the grain costs 6 piastres or less the kilogramme all over that country, while it is sold at 25 or more in the capital. The line could reckon, besides, on the greater part of the transit trade from Europe to Syria, Egypt and India; for if the line to Kronstadt, in Transylvania, should be finished, and this line connected by Bucharest with the Danube, the communication between London and Egypt would not take more than seven or eight days. So this line, intersecting and connecting the most productive parts of European Turkey, would be more sure to pay than any other contemplated. At Enos, or any other convenient spot in the Archipelago, it is intended to make a great entrepOt of commerce. The whole line would be from 320 to 350 miles in length.
The conditions which MTr. Layard proposes are very favourable. He asks for no guarantee. He hopes that the advantages of the line he proposes will be sufficient to induce capitalists to take a part in the enterprise, and certainly the dubious guarantee of the Turkish Government in the present state of its finances onght scarcely to come into consideration with the probability of the large profits which this line offers.
Mr. Layard asks for the gratuitous cession of all the ground required for the main line and its branches, the concession of the ground necessary at Enos or any other point chosen in the Archipelago for the docks and entrep6ts of commerce; the grant of all the forests, mines, and quarries which might be required for the construction of the line, and which are situate in its vicinity; the concession to be for 99 years from the completion of the Elne.
The Turkish Government, I need not teU you, is wild aoboat Lhe scheme, as you may-judge from the circumstance that in five days the whole affaii was settled without any intervention of Ambassadorial power, and the Irad6 is being made out. This is not to be wondered at, for the line is of the highest importance to the Government, not only in a financial but in a political and military point of view, connecting, as it does, the different provinces of European Turkey, and facilitating the march of troops; and even the Turks can distinguish a purely commercial speculation from one in which the interests of the empire are not lost sight of.
PRUSSIA.
(FRO.I OUR 0owN CoRRESPONccEr.)
BERLIN, JtN. 13.
The Grand Duke Constantine arrived here yesterday morning early, %nd proceeded in the course of the day to Hanover, whence he wil fetch the Grand Duchess back to this place after a stay of perhaps a week or two. The Grand Duke is travelling under the name of Admiral Romanoff, and is accompanied by his Adjutants, Colonel Greig, Lieutenant Prince Uschowski, and a gentleman in waiting named Golowin. On the part of this Court, General von Bonin and Major von der Goltz, of the Hussars, were appointed to wait upon him during his stay. Even when he returms hither it does not appear as if his visit wiU be of any length in Berlin, as Nice is the real destination of the Grand Duke and Duchess; Paris, however, is to be favoured with a more lengthened stav on his return from the South. Apropos of Nice, it may be worth while here to contradict the malevolent report circulated a few weeks hack in a number of il-conditioned journals of the South of Europe about an English lady of title having refused the Dowager Empress of Russia permission to walk over the grounds of the Villa Gastaud, which she occupies at Nice. So far from having been refused admission to the ViUa Gastaud, the Empress remained for some time in the garden, and then walked through the woods. The report was probably occasioned by her Ladyship, who was not well, having given directions that some of the hack carriages belonging to the suite should leave the court-yard in consequence of the noise made by the servants. This Idle and unfoundedreport is but one of thousands that appear habitualy in the continental press to the disadvantage of the English character, whether in its private or political relations.
The presence here of the three Roman Catholic prelates whose approaching arrival I lately mentioned-his Eminence Cardial Prince Schwartzenberg, the Archbishop of Olmiltz, Count Furstenberg, and the Prince Bishop of Breslau, Dr. Forster-excites a great deal of attention in this town. As I have already stated, their visit is one of ceremony to the King, as sovereign of a portion of their dioceses, which they are just now visiting. After their official presentation to His Majesty on Friday they were invited to dine with the Royal family at Charlottenburg on Saturday, and in the evening were present at a very brilliant SOi1ee given by the Prince of Prussia. The pontifical high mass which was performed on Sundlay last in the Catholic church here, with the as-
sistance o. the three abovementioned prelates, is the fist instance on record of the rites of that church being celebrated with so great pomp in this Catholic congregation in Berlin. On this occasion the unusualy high rank of the officiating prelates gave this particularly heretical population an opportunity of seeing all the pomp of costume, &c., which that church lavishes on its officers for the captivation of tbemultitude. The Cardinal, after bestowing his blessing on the assembled congregation and going through the preparatory service, was indued with thd various robes and attributes his high ecclesiatical rank entitles him to wear, he himself seated on a throne on the Gospel side of the altar. Among these robes, &c., are the dalmatica, the tunicella, the stola, the pectoral cross, the cingulus, the alb, the amictus, the gloves, the ring, and the mitre; and when these wei e all in order he rose from his throne, and, assuming the crosier, proceeded to celebratehigh mass. He was assisted by the Prince Archbishop of Olmihtz and the Prince Bishop of Breslau, two presbjktei ho)wrarii, and two ministiI sacri; and, besides these, by the min,ist,i ad mitram, ad pedem, ad gremiale, and ad Wirna,m, by acolytes for Ithe ablutions, the tapers, and the censer, &c. During the celebration of the service the Cardiual administered the sacrament to a number of the congregation. At its conclusion all the above enumerated robes, &c., had to be taken off, and replaced by the purple mantle and th« cardinaXa hat, On leav-
ingthe altar-lheC!ardinal proceeded downthe ia>~e, blesiing all present as zhe went, andaeven:outside the church, while standing on theflight of steps preparatory to getting into his carriage, he did not begrudge his pontifical blessing to, the numerous gaping and curious crowd assembled round'the edifice, The Cardinal Prince SchWArtzenberg, who I has a4ready been In possession of his cardinai'- s a
Iabout 15 years, is not more than 47 years old, nor do his figure gud countenance lead one to rate him even so far advateed in life as this.
Prince Friedrich Wilhehn) who arrived here on the last day of the old year with his parents to be present at the "jubilee" of his father, the Prince of Prussia, left here again on the 4th inst. for Breslau, where he will probably reside for the next nine months, and dovote himself to his military duties, so as to enable him to take General's rank before his marriage takes place. The same apartments have been fitted up for him in the Royal Schloss there as were occupied by the late King and Queen; that which the late Queen Louisa occupied has been converted into a study for the young Prince, and is already graced by a marble bust of her late Majesty, and by a fulllength oil painting that has just within the last few days arrived there from Berlin. It is not difficult to guess that this latter unnamed picture is the fulllength portrait of the Princess Royal, by Winterhalter, which was in the last exhibition of the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. The bureau of the 11th Regiment of Infantry, of which the young Prince has received the command, has been established on the ground floor of the Palace, and his various adjutants have also received quarters under the same roof. The various receptions of the different military and civil bodies and corporations connected with the town of Breslat and the province of Silesia assume gradually the character of Royal levees, and show the distant observer how princes learn on provincial boards the art of playing king, to be practised subsequently on the larger theatre of the capitaL During the' few days that his Royal Highness was present here, at the commencement of this month, no clerk of the works was more assiduous early and late in visiting the works going on at the palace of the late King, which is being converted into a suitable residence for himself and the Princess Victoria. Of course, whatever considerations may be admitted to influence the date of their nuptials, there is none so imperative as the completion of theirfuture dwelling, if not init&every detail, at least in its main features and extent. The impatience of the youthful bridegroom would, I hear, be content with a preparation of a very moderate portion of the building, rather than allow his union to be postponed for mere considerations of bricks and mortar; but, unfortunately, the requirements that the 19th century puts forward with regard to princes and princesses do not admit of any return to the pastoral simplicity with which Corydon and Phyllis may have given themselves up to seclusion and the joys of mutual affection.
All the numerous mementoes of the late King, consisting of the entire furniture of his apartments as they stood at the time of his death, wereremoved soix emonths ago from the palace, which is nowbein'
converted for the use of the future Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia, and placed in a building situated .i the garden of the Montbijou Palace, one of the wings of which the King lately gave to the English residents here for a chapel, and put it in thorough
repair for their use. In the desire to protect these| treasures, of inestimable value as they are to the Royal family, and also to the history of Prussia, as containing a number of authentic portraits of distinguished persons, some servants of the palace managed to overheat the stoves that had been put up for the purpose of keeping them dry, and one night at the beginning of this month a coluum of smoke and flame that issued from the roof showed that these highly prized mementoes of the Royal couple were in a fair way of being consumed. Fortunately Berlin possesses a most efficient Fire Brigade, and before the alarm had even been given the engines had driven up to the palace gate, and the exertions of the men in the course of an hour or two succeeded in saving everything of valne.
The Grand Duke Constantine, who arrived here yesterday somewhat later than he was expected, aud without his suite, is understood to have met with an unpleasant accident on his way hither. W11hile his travelling carriages were crossing the DV Ni, which seems not to have been very firmly frozen, the ice gave way, and, althou^gh the firstcarriage with the Grand Duke got over safely, the second, which contained Prince Uschowski and several other members of the suite, broke through, and it was with great difficulty that it could be prevented from sinking. It is very remarkable that the severe cold which has set in here within the last week seems to be a native product, and not to have been imported from Russia, for all travellers from there mention the mild weather they left behind, and their consternation at finding here severe cold, ice, &c.

THE GOODWIN SANDS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Possibly you may think it worth while to publish the fact that the Gull lightvessel has two lanterns, the South Sand Head vessel one, and the Goodwin lightvessel three lanterns at the north end of the Sand. The South 'Foreland has two lighthouses upon it, and these two lights brought in one lead a vessel clear and safe to the south of the Sand. They are, however, on a cliff some hundreds of feet high, the Gull lights probably beingonot more than 25 or 30 feet above the water. These two lights, therefore ander ordinary circumstances could scarcely be mistaken the one for the other. It seems, however, possible that in such a storm of wind and snow as the Violet was wrecked in the error might have occurred.
S a me,ans, perhaps, of preventing a fAture calamity, I would suggest one of the Gulll lightvessels lanterns should be a red one, which I believe would be as cheap andl effec. tual a remedy as comld be adopted.
_ I am very faithfully yours.

,To the Biddle, Commsercial, Maunfacturing, a%d Indutrial
Classes of the United Kingdom.
Fellow $Vuiltrymen,-In redeeming our prorise h point Out rmore distinetb, the evils of the systemof taxation whhih prevailst aprsent Ani t¢,s country, and to suggest a better we adopt the heading pr,e- to our first addrmss by tho Editor gf Z7ie TimcM thougli t j,ie- no intentionof reply.
setrioull3 to the bantering comndb2ti. with Which he has been pleased to ecoinpscy it. - Tu t thiJ 1VulId be sheer supererogation since you ar aible to judge for yots,
elves bov far ehae comsmentary apphieg iO or is justified by our remonstranco. To some portions of it we tball allude, because they embody and foster very common prejadices; as to. the rest, Wo shall only observe that if our critic thinks the present s-ystema a good one, he ought to have defended it; wbile, iffie deems it bad it was his duty to state Nhat he would substitute for it. iaving neglected to do either, he has only wasted time, perverted talent, and mocked the public, by indulging in burlesque mnisrepresentations of those who do suggest reforms which, in their judgment, will be most beneficial to all claswes of the community.
There must be taxation. The sole question is, whether it shall be direct, indirect, or a combination of both. Now, we are firmly convinced that a system of direct taxation only is that which will best promDot the interests of this country.
It is not true, as n4z Times suggests, that we contemplate "the aboHtion of every impost whatever except one," or that we are so foolish as to imagine that such a tax, however just and equitable, can be levied "1 in a manner whioh shall be perfectly inoffensive and agreable -" or, as it is elsewsere worded, "both aa.Ant to Al paltes and harmles to all constitutions." What we do contemplate is, the abolition of all impost on commodities and mnaterials of nmanufacture, anad the substitution of a tax on property, income, and earnings of all kinds, fail assessed, according to theircapitalized value; retaining, if necesary or aavisable, the succession duties, and some others, direct in their operation, cheaply colcUted, a6nd unexceptionable in their nature Ms any taxes can be. We also believe that much, if not all, that is annoying and inquisitorial in the proeedings of agents now irueponsible mnay be avoided under the plan suggeated by one of our body-Mr. T. tR. Jeffery-in his evidence before the select committee of the House of ComImons. It tmay suffice here to state that one part oi that plan embodies grat improviements in the machinery for workig the tax, the effects of which wl be to sEcure fitness and rca onsibilityintheagenmtand topre ventalunnecessary publicity. We confess tat we are not sanguine enough to pragines that, by any proes, taxation can be rendered eicth pleasant or palatable to all parties. Ith t bet, a necessary evil; hut we ace no reason why the e soru be aggravated by gross injustice, preposterous waste, or most unwarrantable exposrv of private affiairs,
It is net true, as The Tzmes states, that our lplan' includes a tax of " not less than 6s, a-pouind, more probLbly 7s. or 8ra, on the estimated income of all the property in the kingdom." Sup osi that incomes and eanings of all kidr contlyam ted to pers000,000n per annum (a modoe
raestiatl, cnsidering that much more than a-tenth of this sum wo raised by taxes last ye), the Editor will see that a tax of 2s. in the poundrwould rais the revenue he mentions, paying the coat of collection besides, even on the
esent extravagant scale; and also that, retaining other Direct taxes, a smaller rate per cent, than this would be sufficient.
It is not true that we propose to tax "the fortn teo poprietor of a house, or a 1arm, of a bankr, or a gallery of pictures, a service of silver plate, a diamond necklace, or anything that can be sold in the market, only i per cent, annualy or, at the most, 1t per cent." We would assess all such things at itheir marketable value, and charge one uxsdform rate, on the interest of that value.
Neither isit true that the "Liverpool Financial Rteformere, contemplate exacting om persons having an income of less thau 1e!. from the sunds, a contribution of "1i0 or 40 per cent, of the annual dividend ;" but, inasmuch asan inoeon
of 9m from the Funds has a present marketable value of about 2,970v, which may he realized any day, while the clerk- or artisan's income of 100!., supposing it to he worth full fie times that amount, only represents at the utmost a capital of 500., they think it a crig injustice that one should be liable to tho tax and the other wholy eseape it.
But the moat invidious of the from The TimRes dais, yierhad ,.6. that 3d.,a misrepresen ations of siderabymoes tn p ha tha c w for the purpose of exciting prejudice, se *p identify us with the town due' question. Our reply is simply that, inasmuch as we are neithor the makers, supporterm, or advocates of taxes on trade, and have nothing whatever to do with t.hema beyond payinl them, the sneers of The Times fal wholly beside the markinc this matter, as they do in others.
We now proceed with the general question, and in the first instance we beg to cal Your most serious attention to the mode in which indirect tmexation operates.
From the official " inance Accounts" for the year ending sareh 31, 8sM, pagge 8, we find that the net revenue from taxeswas 69,808,96 2s. 2d. and that of this umt Castoms and Excise duties yielded 40,345,1801. 3s. 3d., or very considerably more thn e half. Of this amoant no less thin 36,607,7941. 1ns. GAd. appears to have been levied on 15 articles only-viu., butter, cheese, coffee, corn, currants, figs, malt, peppr, raisins, rice, s s
and wiro yonsee what rae andidatycounsntitsgributed tobacco and ine(se "Fnanc Acouns,'pages 21, 22,23, and 261. Enormons as this sum may seem, It is not half, or anythig like half, what these duties aCtuary cost theacountry i
enhanced prices to cover expenms and profits of iraporters anddars and harges forcollection in the shape of sctual payments, andin reatrnited or utterly prevented trade, in
thewyo lois, tot dsay nothing of an enormons miitary and
aval M e hrle, now, it mauy be, more or less necessary
for the hfenc *o our ~asts against neighbours whom the Custom-house makes stc ngcs, andl whJose alliance with us, now at the mercy of the fist diplomatic squabble about some matter of equa importance with a Spanish marriieo, or a Syrian invasion, would sool bea ade enduting by open ports and freetrade. Now,weask yo to consider seriousy whether anything can be more preposterous than a system whichimposea upon the countrv a burden of 2s., at the very least, for the purpose of reali nng i s.?
Here you see what trade and iidustry contributed. What was the q iota from ladnr sYou know that all the land of this country not retained by the Crown was pareled b out at the Conquest, on condition of military service, and that this ccndition was afterwards commuted for a tax of 4s. in the pound, " at a rack rent, and according to the true yearly -value thereof." We find from Sir John Sinclair's fistory of the llerenuu that, durng the reign of William M.e, from 10 to 17029, the whole sum raised by taxes was 72,047,359i, to which the land-tax contribute 19 174,0591,l ortconiderably more thar a fourth part. Now, last year the net amnount of the land-tax was just 1,157,52,51. Os. 1lAd. ("FinanctAccounts,"p. 28), beingless than a 62d-pare of Elet net revenue from taxes only. laost not worth your while to consider by what sort of legislative juggling this transfer of the burden, from land to trade and idustry, has been effected, and whether the injustice cannot be redressed ? Is it rational to seek the repeal of a tax which does reach land, though inadequately, and leave it liable only to the fraction of a farthing in the pound to which the " 4s. " h ave d w in dled, th us in e vitabl y c o m a in g th e b rd ean , aso in -
We have stated our reasons for believing that the gross produce of Customs and Excisendutiee is not half of what they actually cost the country. It would be welnif this doubling of the burden were all the evil occasioned by indirect taxation, hut it constitutes only a small portion of that evil. We crave your attention to other consequences which flow unavoidably from it,
It is demonstrable that the effect of such duties as those on butter, cheese, and corn, is to raise the price of all the butter, cheese, and corn, consumed in this country, whether of hoe or foren g oth, by at least the amount of those duties; and tus. the conumner, even tbough he never uses an atom of the forein articles, to which the tax is ostensibly limited, does, in realty, pay that tax, not to the State, but for the benefi, of the home producers. They are, in fact, protective duties imposed upon the whole community for the advantage of one particular class, andathat not the working altoturists, whose interests are most strictly fidnt,ifie awrith the prosperity of commerce and industry, but of therowners of land, who are our legislators.
The duties on comigodties not produceda in this country, whether levied by weight or measure, are equally objectionable in another way. Being precisely theoinsameinamount, whatever tin qualty and price of the article, they, of course, preeslmost beavily on the descrintions of goods in generalouse,-that irs to say, on those usd by the poor,and most lightly on thoce which are only accessible to the rich. Thuts, whether the actual value of tea be 10d. or 6s.
perlb. ; that of spirits Is, or 10s. per gasllon; that of tobsceo, Gd. or 5s. per lb.; or that of wine 6d. or 10s. per lottle, the duties, in all cases, are the same, the poor paying, several times over more per cent, than the rich. The effects are to limit consumption, to restrict trade, and often to, prevent it alto. gether. For examnple : a paltry revenue of 26,2311. appears to have been extracted lest year from figs. Now, there is a description of figs suitable for general consumption, and produced in large quantities, which, we are assured by an experienced impoter',miht be introdluced and sold at four-
pnce per pund hutrfomr the duty, which altogether excludes them from the market. We are fuirt-her informned that a trade in this article, amounting to a large sum aunually, might speedily be developed but for this obstacle. You see, thkrefore, that a lucrative branch of trade, a new fopen-
ing to our manufactures, increased omployment to the industial classes, and the introduction of a cheap and wholesonne fruit, are all prevented by an impolitic tax, which produces comparatively nothing to the State. And this is
ut a sample, derived from one article only, of the effects of that short-sighted and most injurious system which so many of you seem disposed at present to extend and aggravate.
Another objection to indirect taxation is that, under it, the working man, who has nothing but his labour to depend upon, consumes, individually, of articles not produced in
is country, such as coffee, sugar, and tea, as much as the rich mau who is in the enjoyment of thousands of patrimonmal acres, and, if he be in goodhealthandconstantemployment, probably more. Thus he pays through his stomach at least as much as the rich man, and he also pays, indirectly, the protective duties on butter, cheese, and eorn, which enhance the prices of therich man's produce at home, even though he never use an ounce of the things on which the duties are actually paid. Moreover under this system, contribution to national necessities becomes, in defSanco of every sound principle, a matter of choice or accident-the ric unmarned miser need pay nothing; the poor man, with a large family, must pay heavily.
It is, in fact, almost impossible to exaggerate the injustice inherent ia and the evils inevitably resulting from our present system of indirect taxation, The latter may bo thus epitomized,-improvidence, fraud, political corruption, perjury, adulteration, restriction of trade and industry, contempt of revenue legislation, which soon leads to contempt of all other laws, smuggling, bloodshed, murder, and, in short, almost every kind of vlany Ona the other hand, it is equally impossible to cxaggerate the benefits which would fow from the abolition of that system. We believe that, with perfectly untrammelled commerce, this ecountry

The remedy we propose is the aoic tmao of lndiret
taxes, and thet aubtitutiOn of a just and equitable system of
taxes,n ages, the caluLte toafratiuof all nindirof direct taxation, of which a real property and income tax shall be the main feature. The present tax ahioh, ou wso many grounds, has so justly excited your indigntion is not such a tax at alL As the act originally proposing it prperly alleges, it is a tax gon prefits arising from propert, prafdssions. trades, and offices;" ut, nortunately the protits, whether their sources Be transitory or permanent, whether wvorth 2, 3, 10, or 30 years' purchase, whether held in perpetuity, or entirely dependent on the health and ifo of the person receiving them, all ae treatoed at if they were of exactly equal vatlue, all a xubjected to one trly Procu s- tean process by the tax collector. What we sugest as
substitute for this, and for all indirect taxes, is ptor apro pert]', whether productive or unproductive, andl all incomes and earings at first sigth shall b capitalized wacording to their marketale or their caiculated vaiue, ana that the ordinary intersut of that capitalied vaine shall be the sumn on which the tax, whether that be 5 or 10 per cent., or whatever it may be, shall beo levied
Unider this system perfect justice would be done to all clauses, and whatever statemen and poiticianse, anxious to avoid trouble or interestd in the preservation of abuses, may say to the contrary, there is no real difficulty in the way of carrying out the necessary arrangements. There are in common and daiy use tables in which the vaslue of property held in fee, on lease for yeas or for lives, of terminable and perpetual annuities, and of the expectation of life at different ages, is calculated to a fraction. In poit of fact, the obascles which our rulers and legislators choose to represent as insuperable are daily encountered and overcome by every insurance-office in the k-ingdom.
Justice being thus madle the basis of all taxation and wise economny, accompanied by honest and intelligible accounuts, the rule of Government, we should expect soon to see such. an imiprovement in the tone of public moraity that to cheat the State, now too generaly re ed as the moerest jeccadilloin the world, wibo lookedupon pretty miuch i the s , as we the picking of pockets or robbing on the high way.t hus, the patriot, t moralist, the p ilt othropist, the lover of peace, the friend of progres, and the taxplayer himself,hve all thet estronges motivs and iimost direct winterestyi brign abouiret thxatentirerevision ouf our fiscal

To the working man in b the receipt of, sy, 20s. per week, it may seem at nd st sight that it would be a gnat hardshi to have 2s. stopped wreeky from his wages, ifna tax so hig
as 10 per cent, were found reqiste ; which we by no maeans anticipate. But, supoingts atis t were so, when he cbmeg tooconsider that hewil have allhis necessaries and luxuruies untaxed; that in l probabieo ty the oonsequences of the immense impetus thus iven to commece and manufactares w"i be constant insoawfu p caonst mploymnct, and the raising of his wages from 2O5.o2os a-weekc; and, lastly-, that when receiving no wages, from sickn~ess or other cause, he would pay no taxes, as he now must do, whether sick or well, working or idle he wil so that nobody has a greater interest than hizsoftein the substitution of direct for indtirect taxation. In order still further to reconcile the working classes to the proposed change, which may eem hard to the unreflecting portion of them until its advantages are proved by their own expoerienc, we wolda also suggest that every man paying this tax should have a vote for members of Parliament, thus realzing for the first time the constitutional theory of the coincidence of representatiom with taxation.
We have now, felow-countrymen, indicated the principle on which a just system of direct taxation may be founded, It is, as we have previously obsorved, for our rulers and reprentatives to work out that principle,-for you to iAsthat tlis hallbe done. Thelpreoent tax "onlprofits" is one mas of anomalous injustice, so wel calculated to disgust you with direct taxation that it might have been contrived for that especial purpose; hut it differs most widely from what direct taxation ought to be and 5ight bo made. Still the existing imp~ost as it stands, with sall its faults, its iniquities if you will, is infinitely preferable to the continuance and aggravation of restrictions upon coinmereo and industry,which wilibe the inevitable result. of its abolition.
We therefore counsel you, as you value your own trae interests and those of the nation, not to direct your efforts to any mere tinkering of the property and income tax, so called-still less to its absolute repeal-buit to insist, with one heart and one voice, on the adoption of the two fnndamental principles of the Liverpol Piacial Rteform A.-ssociation, which are these -
"I.L To use all lawfu and constitutional means of inducing the mocA rigidl economy in the expnditure of the Government, consistent 'with due efficiency in the several departments of the public service.
"2. To advocate the adoDtion Of a'stmplp, and equitable system of direct taxation, fiiirly levied -upon proparzty and income, in lieu of the present unequal, com?lctd n expensively collected duties upon commodities.'Vetd n
On these principles the association was founded in April, 1848; it has since that periGd steadily maintained them, and in their triumph we see aL certain prospect of such a pitch of national greatnes and prosperity as cannot otherwise be attained.
Before concluding this appeal to your patriotism and commonL sense we think it right to correct two inaccuracies in our first address, though they affect the illustrations cnly, not the argument. The revisions of the 5th and 6th Victoria, cap. .35, for ascertain ig the full annaal value of l-and, seem to meet the case supposed,-that of low rents and periodlical fines; and the l6th anud 17th Victoria, cap. 34, did reduce the agricultural boundary from 3001. to 200., so that the farmer paying the latter rent is liable to the income-tax on half of it.

Steam Ploughing.
STEAM PLOUGHING.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Siu,-A letter has appeared in your columns from Mr. Snitb, of Woolston, in reference to the invention of stean cultivation, vwhich will give such extended circulation to an attack on my character that I should be glad if you would insert the following reply to his observations.
1 first met Mr. Snuth at the meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society at Carlisle. He was introduced bv Mr. P. C. IRansome, as requiring some tackle for workin;' by steam a cultivator of his invention, which he found too heavy to be worked by horse-power. Mr. Smith introdu,ed the subject to sne by producing a page from tho society's journal of the preceding January, on which was enengraving of the plan of windlass and ropes I had exhibited at the preceding meeting of the society at Lincoln for applying steam power to the draining plough.
This drawing had been furnished by me to Mr. Eancond, the then editor of tho journal, at his request, and appended to the report was the remark that the judges could not help seeing "that such a plan as was then shown seemed to offer every prospect of apractieal solution of the problem of steam cultivation."
I supplied Mr. Smith with this tackle, with no other instructions than that he required one mile of rope for tho sizo of fields he wished to work in.
In none of the details did I receive any assistance from him. In fact, he did not even see the tackle or drawings during their progress through the works, and from his own showing his first trial was a eomplete success, and so pleased was he with the result that he wroto to me saving he would certainly not allow me to lose money by the "exeent windlass" I had sent him, and he should not object to pay me any extra cost over and above the stipulated price-a promise from which he withdrew at a later period
My foreman went to Mr. Smith's for the avowed purpose of testing the traction of ropes on the gronnd, and it was well known to Air. Smith that this was formy information; and as I have in no singlo'detail ever copied any of his plans he can hardly accuse me of abusing his confidence. Of his hospitality I never partook.
As a great deal of unnecessary animus has been thrown by others into this subject, perhaps you will allow me to rmsnak, in addition, that I consider any originality on my part was rendored in many respeets impossible by the number of previous experiments and patents ; that in many of the details I have had most able assistance from Messrs. IXansome's foreman, Mr. Worby (the plan of anchors I amn now using being his invention); and that all I lay claim to in the matter is the selection of the best plan that has yet appeared from the mass of patents that have become pnbhlc property or are tho subjects of patents, and when the lstter is the case I have always been willing to aeknowledge them in such a way as is satisfactory to the patentees.
W,ith these I have made such combinations and modifica. tions as my long experience in steam drainage las suggested and thus, by a large expenditure of time and money, have at l&at succeeded in rendering that practical which has been hitherto chimerical.
I am, Sir, yours obediently,

REPRESENTATION 07 SALFOnD.-A meeting of the electors of Salford was to be held last night to take steps for presenting a requisition to Mr. Alderman lAngworthy to put himsegl in nomination for the representation of the borouglh. The requisition had received up to yesterday inoon about 1,400 signatbres out of a constituency of 4,000 elcetors, and as the signatures inltudo the names of men of all shades of polities there is tho probability of an o sition, and-no whisper of anything of the kind has been = of. It was expeoted the meeting woould appoint a deputation to present the requisition, and there was no doubt that MIr. xangworthy would accept it. Mlr. Lanrgworthy is of liberal politics, but atands high in the estimation of a11 classes of people. The Speakcer's warrant will probably iEsue on the 27th or 25tb inst., so tbat the nomination and election may be expected to be fixed for about the 3d and. 4th of February.

I LONDON, PRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 1857.
I If anybliing of late has surprised the world more
thain Russia's ill-success in arms it has been her Iill-success in diplomacy. From the time the
late CzAR was so imprudent as to ,witlhhold the Vunul form5 of courtesy from the new Emperor el
the Vixxrcn to the preseiit hour some manifestation of the alleged skill of Russian Ministers and Ambassadors has been waited for in vain. The discreditable juggle so soon exposed respecting the two Bolgrads is a sign that the art of negotiation has deteriorated at St. Petersburg into the practice of the merest trickery. But a stiUl stronger proof of failing tact is to be found in the tone of Russian soiety and the Russian press towards France. The Muscovite politicians are playing their game feebly and foolishly. The situation it is not difficult to understand. France and England were united in a great war, which they brought to a successful conclusion. This war proved that the two countries commanding the sea, and possessed of great wealth, must be more than a match for Russia or any coalition which she could form against them. Therefore her natural wish is to divide them. Now, this an astute politician may think it very possible to do. France and England have been enernies, and are even now, in many respects, rivals. Their institutions at the present time are widely different, and the English people are not slow to comment on the difference in a manner that perhaps is disagreeable to the powers that are established at Paris. England has a great empire, a great marine, an almost universal preponderance-things which in themselves are not unlikely to raise envy, and have actualy obtained for us the honour of incessant reviling from the. band of continental politicians. To separate England and France is accordingly a very fair game; but how has Russia played it? So unskilfully, we think, that al chance of a Victory is lost for the present. Such men as Russia once possessed would have been much more dangerous antagonists. They would have made advances to France with dignity and decency. They would have made a shlow of accepting the new dynasty with a side glance of regret for the Bouitnoss, with whom they had long been allied. They would have feigned a kind of manly shame at the first intercourse With a nation from which they had sulffered a great defeat. It would have been subtle flattery to say " We hold to our Legitimist faith, but a great " man has rendered its realization impossible; we " are still Russians, with the remembrances of " 1812, but it is a necessity to accept as friends "4 those whom we cannot overcome as enemies." A little backwardness would have given a value to concession. In this case good taste would have been good policy. But, as it is, the thing has been grossly done. Who can be deceived by the adulation and fawning of the Russians and their organs ? The change is too sudden, and the motive too obvious. In the bitterness of their defeat, and the intensity of their hatred against us, as the most earnest and inveterate of their enemies, the Russians have rushed into excesses of sycophancy which are beginning to make them ridiculous. We ourselves, although our opinion of them has been lowered by lats events, cannot but be surprised at such extravagances on the part of the ruler and people of a great empire. Russia has still 60,000,000 inhabitants, with a vast territory, and must always be powerful; but, if anything could make men believe to the contrary, it is the unworthy abasement of her present position.
A letter from St. Petersburg which we published three days since is a fair example of the prevailing tone. The writer, though led away by the continental mania for generalization, and accordingly rather vague and nebulous, gives what we doubt not is a genuine plan of the present Russian policy. France is invited to join in a strict alliance with a people which respects and admires her. Of course, it is not for purposes of aggression-it is merely for the development of industry, commerce, and peaceful progress. It is some triunrph for the nation of shopkeepers that every military monarchy, with its half-million of troops, its passports, and its polce, is obliged to use this language. We know it is only cait; but even this hypocrisy is a homage to our principles, and we accept it. To foster industry and comnmerce in conjunction with France, the Russian plan of proceeding would be as follows:-France and Russia would control Prussia, and the three united would be invincible. No one would dare to attack them, for in that case "the aggressor " would be crushed." France would then dimiMish its army and become a first-rate naval Power, gathering moreover round it the secondary navies of Europe. Thus would the naval supremacy of England disappear. Russia would then advance
industrially and commercially, of course-into Central Asia, and France would profit by her connexion with so increasing an empire. Finally, England would be conquered in the peaceful strife, and driven from her Indian empire, now useless as a commercial possession. In Europe, France and Russia would exercise a political protectorate. There are, according to the writer, points of striking resemblance between NArOL.EON II. and the CzAI-between France and Russia. Both Emperors are reserved in manner and uninfluenced by favouritism; but the resemblance of F.rance to Russia is stil more important. "The Czmt, "in whom resides absolute power, is pleased with "the ideas, and especially with the form of "tho Imperial Government in France-that "supreme authority which alone promises consis"tency of design, and permits independence in the "accomplishment of great ends." France, formerly "inoculated with the virus of a constitution
a PA'nglaise," is now restored to health, and, with her new institutions, is a safe ally for the CZAR.
All this is sufficiently commonplace, and differs in nothing from what we may read any day in more than one Belgian or German newspaper. But, if the letter gives true indications of the Russian scheme, there is matter for consideration in the proposal that the Russo-French protectorate shall revise the Treaty of Vienna. Mixed with the usual quantity of abuse of EDgland, whicll is charged with having imposed on Europe for 40 years the rggime of an armed peace, "' by the " elements of disorder, placed with infernal art "under every throne of the continent," is a threat that the " bastard monarchies, constructed " of pieces and fragments," shall be dissolved. England alone, it is alleged, gains by the present sitate of affairs. The evils "have fixed the "attention of several great States," and " they "have adlmitted the necessity of changing at any "cost, and radically, such a state of things." The letter adds, that negotiations are even now
penoang on the subJect. Of course, this is mere exaggeration. Negotiations tending to improve the conditiQn or banish the disc-atent of certain provinces may, of course, occupy the attention of Cabinets, but the reconstruction of the map of
Europe is not yet the subject of debate. However, if this letter gives a just view of Russian policy, we find that the CzAn is ready to give up even the most cherisned notidns of his fanily, and play the game of political change with all the spirit of KossuTH or MAzzLxi.
All, however, that we can consider as certain from this document and many others is, that Russia is anxious to entrap France into an alliance, with the purpose of revenging herself on England and domineering in Eturope. But the scheme will not be successful. France has indeed more than once endeavoured to lean on the northern empire. Louis X:VI. was allied with CATERnE, WAPOIXO,zN with PAuL and ALEXANDE against the Engligi. CHALIES X. was occupied ill the same schelne when he fell; and LOUIS PIILIPPE's advances to Nicuoi..as, after bearing fnr 16 years the insults of
the Autocrat, were interrupted only by the Revolution. d Febirary. When a French Monarh
I
I has ben weak at home, or intent on aggresIsion sibroad, he bas sought the siupport of
this ally. But the instances we have mentioned give rather a warning than an encouragement; and oertainly the present Emperor of the FB;jcx is not under the necessity of seeking to prop his throne with Muscovite bayonets. The French, civilized and enlightened, occupying a position in the midst of the most cultivated States of Europe, can never be the allies of the Russians, barbarous and secluded, and only anxious to press down on and occupy more favoured regions. That is, the two nations can never be allied while each remains true to its character. Russia never changes, and 'therefore Europe is in no danger of such an alliance until a French ruler shall be at once desirous of stifling every generous impulse at home and carrying on an aggressive warfare against his neighbours. Such a character the present Sovereign of FBR_kCE is not likely to earn. With the old monarchs he can never have a sincere alliance. To them he will always be au usurper who has seized the heritage of a legitimate race. To us, on the con-
trary, he is as right'tl a Sovereign as any BouBBox or fSlJBaRGH. England is his natural ally, and we feel sure that he will hold fast to the English alliance. That alliance we wish to see endure, because on it depends the future peace of Europe. For ourselves exclusively we have notliing to gain. England is happily free from dependence on any Power. Throughout the whole of her widespread empire the voice of discontent is hushed, and every part would contribute to the strength of the whole in' the hour of need. The extent of herresources and the abundance of her wealth surpass the calculations of the most sanguine. If ever there was a nation which could afford to stand alone, it is England at the present day. But, for the take of those great general interests which the alliance of the Western nations has hitherto upheld, we truast that it may be long before Europe sees renewed the policy of Tilsit and Erfurt.
The bullion robbery on the South-Eastern Rail-
The bullion robbery on the South-Eastern Railway will certainly take a high rank in the romance of crime. As a general rule, larceny is not an offence which excites much interest. The gentlemnanly embezzler of other people's funds, and the hardened murderer whose name lives in the remembrance of high and low, are the heroes of the prison and the sessions-house, while the thief is even by the frateinity of wrongdoers considered to belong to an inferior class. But it seems that even to the lower departments of crime a degree of ingenuity can "be applied which may fit them to be the material for interesting causes. The theft which AGAR, PIERCE, BuRGEss, and TEsTrB planned and completed was no ordinary crime. Well might the counsel for the prosecution declare that it was lamentable to see such skill, dexterity, and perseverance employed in the exec-ation of a criminal design. The case, more than any with which we have been recently acquainted, shows the deliberation, the professional spirit, and, more than all, the pecuniary resources of the modern offender. The revelations of the police and sessions courts have been certainly of late sufficiently astonishing. We find the members of organized gangs lodging money with solicitors, drawing checks on their bankers, and buying or selling foreign stock ; but as an instance of capital deliberately invested in a criminal undertaking we know of nothing which equals the case just concluded.
On the night of May 15, 1855, gold to the value of 12,0001. was stolen from the van of a train on the Soath-Eastern Railway between London and Folkestone. The boxes were weighed in London, and again at Boulogne. At the second plaoa tho-weigh; Uti was su6s64uently dai'cre-u, differed from the weight in London. The weight in Paris corresponded with the weight at Bonlogne; consequently the boxes must have been tampered with between London and Boulogne, or, as it was impossible to touch them while in the boat, between London and Folkestone. Whon the boxes were opened bags of shot were found in the place of gold. Of course, the surprise was great and the search after the offenders earnest. But, whatever miay be the skill of detectives, we know from sad experience that the criminal world is more than equal to them in craft. For 16 months the pursuit was in vain, and the robbery was well nigh forgott6n, when an unexpected revelation threw light on the matter.
A man named EDwAARD Ao.w waa convicted ia October, 1855, of uttering a forged check, and sentenced to be transported for life. This man some time since stated to the authorities that he could give information respecting the great gold robbery of 1855. On being questioned he announced himself as one of the perpetrators, and named as his accomplices PiER-E, formerly in the service of the South-Eastern Company; BuorGss, a guard; and TESTm, a clerk in the traffic department. AGAR is 41 years of age, and has, by his own confession, lived by crime for a term of from 14 to 20 years. His evidence is that PIBRCE first suggested the scheme, and that he himself thought it impracticable. PiEncE said he believed he could obtain impressions of the keys of the CnuBB's locks by which the iron safes were secured, and AGAR then answered that if that could be done he thought the thing might be effected. Now comes the execution of the plan. Time, skill, and capital are all at the disposal of the planners. PixEcz and AGAR go down to Folkestone as casual visitors for the benefit of sea-bathing. They take lodgings and employ themselves in observing the arrival of the tidal service trains, and the delivery of the luggage from the trains to the boats. This is in May, 1854, twelve months before the actual commission of the robbery,-so long a time can modern depredators afford to spend on their preparations. They went down daily to the pier, as if to enjoy the fresh air, but their constant observation of the trains and the station aroused suspicion, and they left, but not before they had discovered " what CHAr"MAN, who had the custody of the key of the iron "safe, did when the trains arrived and the luggage " was removed to the boats." By these means it was ascertained where the key was kept the impression of which it was desirable to obtain.
But to know where the key was kept and to obtain possession of it were very different things, and AGAR, according to his own story, was much disheartened. Not so PixP.Ce. Piymca knew a young man named TEsTsn, who was in the office of the Superintendent of Traffic, and TESTER could get possession of the keys for them. However, time rolls on, and we are in August, when PiBBcz discovers that the locks are to be altered and that the new keys will be in TzsTER's hands. TzsrzR was the clerk who corresponded with Mr. CnuBB on the subject, and by his means the impression of a key which opened one look of each box was obtained. But, as each box I .d two locks, it was necessary to obtain the impresson of another key, and the following device was adopted :-A('n wa in possession of no less a sum than 3,00(,1. It was arranged «at a box of bullion of the value of 2001. should be conveyed in the iron safe in the usual way, and -that it should be delivc-ed to him under the name of Aices R. AGAR goes for the box, and it is delivered to him by CHAPxAN, who opens the rEafe with a key Which he takes from a cupboard. Thus AGar. learns where the second key is kept. Now, how are they t9 obtsin an impression of the key? Two
months have elapsed since they got the impression of No. 1; this is October, and they are stiU without lNo. 2. But they are not disheartened. PaRaxn
and AGAR go down to Dover and put up at the Dover Castle; they walk over to Folkeatone, and arrive just when the train is coming in. In the confusion of an arrival the attendants leave the oflice for a few minutes. PrinRo goes boldly in, opens the cupboard which contains the key of the iron safe, and hands it to AoAr, who takes an impression and then replaces it. Thus five months after their reconnaissaiwe at Folkestone they have surmounted the first difficulty which suggested itself to the reflecting mind of AGARthey have obtained wax impressions of the keys. Everything else remains to be done.
The next thing, of course, was to make keys from the impressions. For that purpose lodgings are taken in Lambeth and Kennington. Prcaco disguises himself in a black wig, and the next two months are spent in filing keys. When the keys were completed to a probable similarity with the masterpieces of CHluBB-no easy task, it would seem, for two inexpert operators with common files-it was necessary to try them. AoAG, went down several times in the van with BuRGESs, the guard. They did not fit at first, but they fitted more nearly every time he went. At last they fitted completely, and the deed was resolved on. Of course, after nearly a year's labour it was not worth their while to fly at any paltry game,-they would wait until a large sum was to be sent. Two chests would hold about 12,0001., and they heard that 12,0001. was shortly to be sent. They then buy shot to replace the gold, AGAX and PIERCE are admitted into the van by BuRxoss, and on the 15th of May, 1855, 12 months after the deed v wa
planned, the boxes of Messrs. SIriEANN, BuLT, and ABELL are securely rifled.
Nineteen months after the crime is committed, and more than two years and a-half after it is planned, justicehasovertaken the delinquents. Their crime is chiefly interesting on account of the ingenuity employed; but its most alarming feature is that men so determined and so skilful should be possessed of the means of subsistence for so long a time. AoAi with his 3,0001., PIERcE with his house at Kilburn, all of them driving about for a year in cabs, and journeying up and down the South-Eastern line with first-class tickets, form a picture of criminal prosperity which we had hardly looked for. With lal this, however, and even with the fruits of their success in full possession, there was among them that element of insecurity on which, with such adroit thieves, honest men have principally to depend. AGXA, pursuing the career of crime which he describes himself as having deliberately adopted, had been at last detected; he had invested the proceeds of his many crimes for the benefit of a woman whom he seems to have loved with all the fondness of which such a man was capable. PIERCE was his trustee, and PIERCE, like a true thief, betrayed his trust. The woman was left des.itute, and her paramour, the hardened felon whom no scruples of conscience would have moved, denounced the half-forgotten robbery from his cell at Portland. None of our readers will fail to sympathize with the manly indignation with whieh Baron MARTri denounced the villany of PIERCE, or to share his regret that the sentence of the law falls lightest on the basest of the villains; but it is to. this very baseness, to the impossibility, as it would seem, of maintaining perfect complicity in guilt, that the public has most to trust for the detection of such accomplished scoundrels as those who were convicted yesterday.
When O'MULLIGAN, the interesting hero of
When 0'MULIGAN, the interesting hero of Mrs. Perkirs's BaU, was asked where he lived, he -nw.ved his hand rather widely up Oxfordstreet. That is -all the answer we have got from that O'MuxLmAu of finance, Mr. Ro1rinsow GLADSTO NE. We asked for the scheme of a Property-tax that should raise the requisite amount, dispense with aU other taxation, and be both practicable and endurable; and, instead of giving us a scheme, be has repeated his former promise in rather more infated language and extravagant terms. We ventured to give him some warnings, fouided on the great facts of existing finance. These he throws asiae with the utmost contempt, and starts from a basis of his own, at once simple and majestic. Setting down the incomes and earnings of the country at the "moderate" sum of G50,000,000l. per annum, he triumphantly observes that 2s. in the pound, or 10 per cent., would raise the desired sum, paying the cost of collection besides; ana that even this light rate might be made lighter stil by retaining the present direct taxes. As this moderate estinmate lies at the very basis of the scheme, we will deal with it first. The estimate implies that every household in the British Isles, on the usual supposition of five persons to a household, enjoys, on the average, an income of 1201. per annum. It is alleged in favour of this estimate that rather more than a tenth of the sum is now paid in taxes. But, considering how much money the poorest, the very beggars, Irish as well as English, spend in spirits, tobacco, and other articles of which the duty constitutes a large proportion of the cost, it is not very surprising that each household should pay, on the average, 121. a-year in taxes. If this is all Mr. R. GL"sTozE has to say for his estimate, we must say that, commencing from the very same fact, we should put the aggregate of incomes and earrings at a much lower sum. The aggregate supposed in the returns of the existing Income-tax is considerably less than a third of Mr. R. GLADSTONE'S, notwithstanding the notorious fact that most people wlho pay Income-tax are ready to swear that they pay on much more income than they actualy receive. The difference is to be made up in the proposal of the Liverpool Reformers by the taxation of al incomes innder 1001. a-yearthat is, mainly by the earnings of the working classes, which they moderately estimate at 400,000,0001. a-year. As we shal presently see, Mr. R. GLADSTO2NE would require even more than this to raise the proposed Income-tax to a strength sufficient for the work it has to do.
The difficulties of discrimination and of collection increase rapidly as we descend in the scale. Even under the existing Income-tax they are only endured becauise the tax is temporary; but, no doubt, there is mnuch injustice and much evasion. Mr. R. GLADsTONE roundly suggests that " earnigs" should be capitalized at five years' purchase, and that the interest of this sum sho-Id be considered tho earner's real income. "Ecmnings," however, sae a very vague ternm. Whba we have a right to expect from a body of gentlemen at Liverpoal calling themselves the Financial Reform Association is a full list of all the different descriptions of property-income, wages, and earnings-arranged in schedules, with the way in which each description is to be treated. Take such a list as the following :-A banker, a brewer, a merchant, a shipowner, a shipbuilder, a stockbroker, a coal-master, a miner, a newspaper proprietor, the proprietor of a business requiring large stocks, such as a contractor, a bookseller, aa upholsterer, a first-class jeweller, a "Manchester "warehouseman," an hotel keeper, or one who keeps horses and carriages for hire; an artisan, a labourer, a butler, a stable-boy, a pedlar, a coetermonger, an occasional waiter, a charwoman, a monthly nulrse, a regular writer, an intvt. mittent poet, a player, a pewulstorz vikb '
out capital or fixed line, &c. We have scarcely gone out of schedule D, because we suspect MIr. R. xLADsTONZ and his friendjend to leave the other schedules alone; yet the idea of capitalizing incbxme at so many years' purchase, once introduced, will find many candidates Xor the indulgence in the other schedules. An ecclesiastical incumbent, the owner of a life interest, whether in land or any other property, a man in a Government office, the owner of a termiznable annuity, and many others, would maintain their position to be as brief or precatious as that of the first class banker or brewer. Even supposing these claims resisted, still the plan of capitalization would affect at least two-thirds of the incomes of the country, and would reduce 400,000,0001. to less financial value and productiveness than 100,000,0001. under the existing tax. Hence it is absolutely necessary that the Liverpool financiers should not oily classify tho incomes and earnings of the country in schedules, appending the mode of dealing with them, but should also state the probable yield of each schedule. As far as we can see, even adopting their own estimate 'of 6560,000,000., and even supposing, further, that they can extract a 10 per cent. duty froUtevery person in the kingdom earning daily bread, ton their own system of capitalizing income they ViU not have property to half the above amount to deal with ; and therefore, even with a 10 per cent. duty, would only raise about 30,000,0001. This is taking their own siqppositions. We don't believe that they would get half that sum.
But the great difliculty is how to get at the incomes and earnings of a whole population, and it is a difficulty in wlich we expect the Liverpool reformers to give us real assistanice. On the ordinary estimate there are 5,400,009 households in the British Isles, and, though mAany of these are such mere heaps of nisery that not even a financial philosopher would invade them ; en the other hand, there are as many persons is the receipt of good earnings, though they are not householders. The C0AxcBLLOR of the E=ngQUER finds it no easy matter to deal with the comparatively srmaU and substantial class liable to the existing Income-tax. All that Mr. R. GLADSTONE ventures to commUnicate of his own method is, that it is perfectly fair and by no means so disagreeable as that now in use. But, considering the reluctance we have invariably found in the humbler classes of society to large payments for public purposes, we suspect the effectiveness of a mode of levy recommended principallyfor itsmildness. Domestic servants of aU kinds and both sexes are very much on the move, and, supposing a housemaid to have left her place at Lady-day, and to be rather short of mioney at Midsummer, we fear the collector, besides the trouble of hunting her fro n lodging to lodging, would find a difficulty in extracting from her the 14s., which, as far as we can estimate, she would haye to pay to a 10 per cent. duty on the capital of her earnings,-the latter, of course, inclucding house-room, board, and wages. Perhaps Wr. R. GLADSTONIV will deride our simplicity in supposing that he will undertake such a task; and perhaps he wil tell us that the master wil pay daty for his servants, and the employers generaRy for their artisans and labourers. Then why does he not say so at once, instead of leading us aU a wild goose chase to find out how he wilL work his system? Question after question suggests itself, for which we can find no answer in his letter. Suppose a lady has a lot of trinkets worth 2001.-no uncommon case, even where there is not much property besides. Those trinkets are property, and 10 per cent. on the present interest of that sum comes to 14s. That seems a good deal to pay annually for a few trifles that an owner in reduced circumstances may seldom have an oczasion for wearing, though she would rather not part with tlhem. Again, suppose the inheritor of a gallery of pictures, being obliged to sell it to pay debts and settlements, reserves as a souW,eir a single RAPHAEL, undouibtedly worth 3,0001. Ten per cent. on the present interest of that slum is 121., which seems a serious annual penalty on a pardonable piece of sentinment. But perhaps pictures, 5ewels, and works of art are not to be so taxed. S> let Mfr. R. GLADsrTo02
explain himself on this point. Then, how about railways ? Are they property, or mercantile income? For exauiple, which is the safest property, a share in the Eastern Counties Railway or one in BARcLAY's brewery ? Is the shareholder in the former to pay 101. a-year on his 1001. a-year dividend, and the holder of the latter to pay only the interest of the aggregate of five years' income-that is, 11. 15s., ae nearly as we can reckon, for every 1001. of di-idend? The unfairness, as we mnust deem it tiU better informed and enlightened on the matter, is tb> be aggravated, onl Mr. R. GO-.Dsrocxs proposition, lby retaining aU the existing direct taxes, including the successiontax, which falls heavily on property. On the whole, it reems to us that any nman in the condition of too many of our gentsy, with a large landed property eaten up by eharges and burdens not the less serious because not legally bindiiig, with an overgrown house full of costly knickknacks, and vith a very scanty establishment, wvould. have to pay heavily on a mere deadweight; while. his neighbour, in a thriving mercantile firm,with are open house and a crowd of servants, carriages, a ud horses, would come offvery easily. Such a financialn system would not suit the genius of this country.; not, at least, if we rightly interpret Mr. R. GL W- STOIENS very sketchy outlines.

PHILADELPHIA, DEo. 27.
The journey from New York to Washington is an excellent experience, as it includes an interestinoge variety of the means of locomotion. The popular belief is that a line of railroad connects the two cities; and though the general impression is not entirely erroneous it is not wholly correct. The sections of the road to the political capital are even more independent of each other than the States they traverse, and, partly from natural causes, partly from causes less intelligible, are very far from complete union between themselves. The intervals of disconnexion are frequent, with the consequence to the voyager of a continual change of vehicle at unexpected hours. These disturbing shifts are not without an advantage, especially by the night train; they prevent the too common waste of time in sleep; night has very little to do with it on the road to Washington. The whole number of changes on the route are these :-first, the heavy hotel coach, carrying nine insides at a pinch, and any amount of baggage, to the steam ferry for the Jersey shore, the Southwark of New York; then the railroad to Philadelphia, as the tickets state, but the Delaware cuts you off from the city proper, and on arriving there is another stfam ferry across the river ;ythen a string of omnibuses is put in requisition to make the connexion with the terminus on the other side of the city towards Baltimore. It is an exceedingly long ride, so long that the streets seem interminable, like those of a city stretching out continually in a dream. But they terminate at last, and, the railway regained, speeds you along for Baltimore-not to it; there is another river to cross-the Susquehanna, a stream to which Campbell's poetry has given a place in our popular geography; had it been a larger river with a less musical name he might not have mentioned it; on such accidentz does fame depend. " On Susquehanna's side," you walk the planks of an inclined plane down to steam ferryboat the third, and this pause in the night ride is turned to account by arrangements on board for a stand-up supper and " drinks" if you choose. The prose of existence, as usual, maintains its ascendancy, and the impressions left of this portion of " Pennsylvania's shore " on a dark winter morning are of a cold wind and execrable coffee. On the opposite bank of the Susquehanna you find the railroad again, and are landed without further interruption at Baltimore. Here the old barbarism of an omnibus has been superseded, and a horse railroad car carries you through the city to the station for Washington. It is the last shift. After taking the train again there is nothing more than the ordinary chances of the road between you and the Federal city. But add to the many changes of velhicle on the route, the score of summons at different intervals from the conductor to give up, show, or take checks and tickets, and it will be perceived that the night train to Washington is kept very lively. Some passengers obtain a little respite and repose from these calls of the official by sticking their checks in their hatband, leaving him to take them without asking. He understands the arrangement perfectly, and glides down the centre of the carriagewithhislamp, picking right and left atthe red andyeloweards,likeabotaniitgatherinanightflowers in a hothouse. AU these are minor evils; the worst result of this disjointed and sectional state of the road is felt at Washington, in the delay of the mails, which break down about three times a-week, depriving the capital practically of one of the great benefits of the railway. The companies contrive to get the passengers through, but appear to have some malicious satisfaction in leaving the letterbags behind whenever they can; with the slightest desire to aid the Post-office the mishap could not occur so often.
The fact tbat, after taking the train at Baltimore, the traveller has nothing but the ordinary chances of the road between him and his destination may not appear consoling, as American railways have n'ot a high character for safety even here, but abroad their evil reputation is crueUy exaggerated. Though there are few foreigners so impressed with the dread of American traveling as the representative of a certain Italian State, who remained three months in New York, unable to muster courage enough to risk the railway to Washington, yet it may be conceded that most new comers take to the road wifh some little misgiving. The native journals seldom soften the details of any accident, and through them the world knows the worst ; the tens of thousands of cases of safe transit that occur every day are of course not heard of. In fact, the apprehension that American railways are less safe than those of Europe soon wears off, and rarely deters any one from travelling.
The type of the American railroad is the old primitive tramway ; steam power has been applied on it, and it has been enormously extended over the surface of the country, but really it is little more than the original tramway still-a single line from point to point, with sidings for trains to pass at appointed times; it is but a slight advance on the short lines of rail between mines and the seacoast that were to be found 50 years ago. Worked by horses the American lines would be perfection of the kind. But the traffic has long outgrown horse-power, and steam has been applied on a system of road construction not large enough for it; competition enforces a high rate of speed for passenger trains ; on nearly al the lines the carriage of goods is immense. The original plan is not extensive enough for the great and continuaUy increasing strain on it, and thus frequent casualties are inevitable. The advantage of the simple, single line of rails is that it could be driven through districts almost wild at very slight expense, where the construction of a double line would have been impossible. And the benefit this cheap and easy system of communication has been to America is incalculable. It has thus become the favourite plan of construction, irresistibly recommended to all companies and directors by its cheapness; and as those bodies are as liable to fall into a routine of ideas and management here as everywhere else they adhere to their established system too tenaciously when it is evidently outgrown by trade and population. In thinly peopled districts the single line is amply sufficient for aU purposes; but between the great cities of the eastern coast it certainly is not, and so rapid is the growth of the interrior that what sufficed for the internal commerce ten years ago carries it now only with difficulty, and a pressure that must be
insecure. As the railroads are superseding the rivers of the continent, they ought in their system of construction to preserve some analogy to them. As the lines approach the coast they ought to be widened a little, so as to receive with less inconvenience the traffic poured into thom by their many tributaries. At present the remote branches are as large as most of the main trunks, and the priacipal'channel is very apt to become a scene of confusion, with danger as a consequence. The necessity of double lines of rails between the most popular centres is recognized, and, in some cases, the system has been adopted; but the 'instances are yet so. few that the single tract ir the rule. The change is expensive, equivalent aXmost
to tha- cost of constracting an entirely nev, line;
and> as most of the companies are not in a ilourishing, financial condition, the change will m)je a very slbw one. And, it would be ver g difficult to. ,eccicile t4s. ATn sican public t , the hiaer rate of farot t]hat. would be requi red to cover
tihn cost 41 84, hno line; in t' Ji reeQQh i
companies and the public are alike in a t,_
bound to a certain system that has the usual ten- I dency to perpetuate itself, and they will probably never wholly emancipate themselves from it.
In point of speed the American passenger and express trains are not much below the average rate on the European lines. From 20 to 30 miles an hour is the usual pace, and, considering the circumstances under which that speed is attained, it is quite as much as need be desired. It is even a little beyond the point of general safety. The lines are imperfectly fenced, and stM more imperfectly watched. Open crossings are frequent, and the line itself is often but a portion of the high road. There is always considerable risk of accident from cattle standing or keeping on the track, or carts carelessly left in the way, and a variety of obstructions easy to imagine. An American night train, plunging on into the darkness at 30 miles an hour, seemingly regardless of faUen trees, trespassing cattle, or forgotten timber-waggons, certain to go through or over auy or all of them if they stand in the way, is almost a challenge to catastrophe. Yet serious accidents are much less common than might reasonably be expected. The frame fxed in front of the engine, called a " cowcatcher," shaves the ground close to the rails, and doubtless throws out of the path many obstructions, besides the unhappy animal it is named from. On the open roads in the outskirts of towns, or where the rail passes through them, the trains proceed very slowly, and a bell continualy rung clears the track. From the first the Americau railways have been less cut off from the ordinary roads than with us; we tax the skill of the engineers to avoid a " crossing on a lever'; here no importance is attached to the difficulty or the increased danger it involves. The common road crosses the line, or the line the road, just as it happens, and these crossings are not even fenced. The two systems of communication are mixed up together, as if steam had been applied upon the ordinary roads, rather than as if separate roads had been cut off and carefully shut in from the face of the country for the exclusive employment of steam. WVe are perhaps too timid about bringing the rail into our streets; it might be done in many localities with great advantage, especially for completing the connexion of the different railroad termini between each other. Transferring freight from the railroad to the waggon, to pass through the city to the rail again, is merely a barbarism, maintaining the exploded system exactly where it is most important it should cease to exist. It has made the ancient slow waggon fast, and created it the tyrant of the streets under the name of the van; but there is no real progress in the change; the old heavy obstruction to the passenger is now his rapid assailant, the speed rendering his weight more dangerous. The great object should be to im. prove him out of our thoroughfares altogether, which might be done with far less difficulty than has been conquered for the sake of slighter benefits.
The American railroad stations bear the marks of the cheapness of construction more than any other parts of the line ; with a few exceptions in the chief centres, they are very inferior in accommodation, and sordid and mean in appearance. As they are generally of wood they will, in course of time, be happily burnt down and got rid of; three have thus disappeared within the last fortnight, and it may be hoped their successors wiU be more creditable. One of the best stations on the continent is at Portland, built bythe Canadian GrandTrunkCompany, perhaps as a model. The carriage accommodation on the American lines is good; the cars are constructed on a very dif. ferentplan from our carriages; long,many-windowed, and furniihed with stoves, they look more like the cabin of a steamer or a canal boat on wheels than a carriage. They are entered from each end, and, as there are only twonarrow doors for 60 people, quick egress in case of accident or the prospect of one is impossible. This seems to be the chief defect in the plan of making the cars so large. They are fitted up very comfortably, though the style differs very much on different lines, and the variety of seats and chairs, with their appliances to obtain ease of position, affords quite a study. The prevailing imperfection is the shortness of the backs of the seats ; they would do to sit out a five act tragedy in, but hardly yield support enough for 18 hours' occupancy. In some cars these seats have been superseded by completeeasychairs. Eachcaris a thoroughfare, or a link in the chain of communication from end to end of the train, so that passengers can pay and receive visits from or to the most distant cars. Newsboys and bookhawkers appear to inhabit the trains permanently, and other petty traffickers appear at intervals, doing inside the carriages the business elsewhere done outside them. All the routine duties of taking the tickets and receiving checks to prove you have given a ticket, and delivering up that check again, are transacted in the cars; as a " through ticket" for a journey of any length may include three, four, or more separate vouchers which have to be thus accounted for, the process in this respect is continually going on ; it seems almost needlessly complicated, as the domains of three or four several companies are often traversed in Europe with greater simplicity of action inthe ticket department. But the stations take no part in this process; they are not built with any reference to collecting tickets, only to sell them; all the rest falls on the conductor. As to the baggage, apart from the rough handling, which is sometimes excessive, and may account for the superior strength the American trunkmakers put into their work, the arrangements are very good; if your luggage is " checked through" its chance of reaching its destination is considerably better than youir own. There is very little weighing, and no paste-pots. The checks are metal tickets, lightly strung on to each article by a leather thong; you take a duplicate of the ticket, and have no further anxiety. There is a system of baggage conveyance, after it anrives, which has been created by private enterprise. Some miles before reaching any chief town a double of the conductor appears in the carriage, and poitely inquires if you have any baggage to be attended to; and in all cases you had better employ his services. You give your name and hotel, and he takes yomr beggage checks, giving a receipt for them. Very soon after your arrival they are in your room. This system of "baggage expressing" ha* grown up wuder the excessive extortion of the American eab
drivers, who are not even speeious in culouring their impositions, but merely and shamelossly impudent. The judicious, thereforaI keep out ottheir clutches as much as possible, a6k. this sysism of conveying baggage as av separate enterprise enables them to do so; -ithout the ibwpdimenta, a good. walk to the hotel is- nothing, aw& you are independent of all drivers and extortica;., Yet a similar system would nob succeed in the- cities of E3hrope, for the simple rsason that the Ze-you pay for conveying youor baggage alone wsuld. ther cawry that

But it is being gradually overcome in the great eities by the absolute necessity of something by which to distinguish those whose work is for the public. The police of New York resisted the uniform because it is less easy to shirk duty in it, but they have been compelled by the public to wear it. Some of the ferry boats have put their men in uliforn, and the railway compauies are introducing the practice. It will save a great deal of trouble aud perplexity, for by instinct you cannot tell who is porter or baggage-master, or at once distinguish either from the depredators who notoriously hang about the stations, and against whom you are warned by placards on the walls. In these minor points the management of an American railway is what a German would call altogetherpo7izei-widzig, though, perhaps, no one but a German can fully appreciate the full significance of the term.

SPIRITED EMCOUNTit wrH GAROrtERS. - On Thursday evening one of the most spirited encounters with robbers we ever remember to have seen recorded took place at Rock Ferry, on the Cheshira side of the Mersey, which would in aU probability have led to the captare of a footpad had not the gentlems.n assailed been overpowered by a third person. Mr. Saxby, a young medical student, aged about 20 years, son of a gentleman residing at Reck Ferry, in the immediate neighbonrhood of Birkenhead, was walking along the highway near his father's house about half-past 6 o'clock, when he observed two suspicious-looking men sauntering at an irregular pace behind him. Suspecting that they intended him foul play, he stopped at the first gaslamp, and waited there unti they passed him. As they did so he heard one of them say in an undertone, * 'He shall have this in his guts if he gives us any of his humbug." M-. Saxby, being a young man of considerable courage, and having been instructed by his father in sword exercise, grasped a short stout stick he had in his right hand, drew a penknife, which be opened andheld in his left hand, and followed the men, determined to see the end of it. He had on two overcoats, and in the breastpoclket of one was a stout pocketbook. After proceedlng a little way one of the men turned suddenly romud an exclaimed, with an osth, " What are you following us for?' Mlr. Saxby replied, in a determined voice, "I will tell you what for if you will fohow me to the police-office." The man muttered a curse, tarned round, and went on, the young medical student still following. On reaching a lonely part of the road, near some railway arches, the same man again turned round and rushed upon Mr. Saxby, with a large knife in his hand. Mr. Saxby put himself in a position of defence, and warded off a fierce blow. Then commenced a regular "'set-to," the burglar slashing and cutting with his large knife, Mr. Saxby receiving the blows on his stick, and slashing his assailant on the head, face, and neck with his penknife. With one desperate lunge the robber planged his knife in the young man's side, the blade cutting through the two coats, and being only arrested in its progress to the heart by the pocketbook, which it penetrated half through. At this juncture the second robber made bis way behind Mr. Saxby, and garotted him. A short time afterwards Captain Hulman, of the ship Lady Ebrington, passing along the road found hin lying senselesS in the middle of the way, with a aight cut across the forehead, his pockets rifled, his trusty stick by his side covered with incisions, and the pemknife stained with blood, and the garotter's large knife by bin side. Captain Hnlman removed the young man to his own hause, where lie remained until he returned to consciousness ; and every admirer of "pluck" will be glad to learn that he is comparatively unhurt. !is assailant no doubt bears unmistakeable marks of the encounter on his face, and the pohca expect, on that account, to trace bim to his hidingplace.
GAr,OTT-nG AT CAsnaBRrDG -At the Cambridge borough police court yesterday four men, who gave their names respectively John Johnson, James liller, John Smith, and - Williams, were examined before the Mayor, 31r. P. Zeales, and afoi bench of magistrates, chargedwith a brutal assault upon Mr. Jonathan Ambery, a member of St. John!' College, in thatUniversity.

The Bullion Robbery On The South-Eastern Railway.
THE BULLION ROBBERY ON THE
SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWAY.
CEnTRAL CRINAL COURT, J,. 15.
The trial of the prisoners Pierce, Burgess, and Tester was resumed this morning, at 10 o'clock, before Mr. Baron Martin and Mr. Justice Wiles, and the court was filled, as on previous occuions, with an anxious and attentive audience, not the least interested of whom was the witnest Fanny Kay, who was in court throughout the whole of the day.
Mr. Serjeant PARRCY at once proceeded to address the jury on behalf of his client Pierce. After calling upon them in general terms to erase from their minds all that they had heard or read with respect to the case previously to entering the jury box, the learnod counsel went on to observe that it was one of the obvious consequences of a free press that there should be from day to day a publc report of what took place in our conrts of justice, and far was it from him for one moment to complain of such reports. He recognized the freedom of the press as one of the greatest blessings which we enjoyed, for such publicity as he had alluded to threw a light apon the administration of justice which enabled every eye in the remotest corner of the land to see that justice was fairly executed; and without that freedom it was not improbable that our courts might become corrupt and the administration of justice be poisoned at its source. But sometimes, in addition to those ordinary reports which no one had any right to complain of, it happened that comments were mado upon cases which were still pending, which -were in the course of primary investigation, and which would have finally to be decided by such a tribunal as was there assembled; and when those comments were mnade in a spirit adverse to the persons accused he could conceive nothing more unfair or unjast. Whether such comments had bean made in this case he was not personally aware; but. if by any accident such comments should have been made, calculated at aU to influence the judgment of the jury, or to impair the impartiality with Which they should view this case, he trusted that they would endeavour to let them pass away altogether from their recollection. This cse was one of amostpeculiar characterinreference to the legal principles which must guide the jury in coming to their verdict; and it rose from the circumstance that the main witness-he was almost going to say the only witness-who proved any real subsantial act done by either of the prisoners in this robbery was himself the perpetrator of it. That man had indeed given a detail and a narrative of the robbery which it was extremely difficult for ordinary minds not to act upon; bat in a criminal court it was their duty to act upon those invariable rales which guided the administration of criminal justico in this country, and which ensured to everyone a fair and impartial trial. His learned frieud Serjeant Shea had said that he did not ask them to convict either of the men at the bar unless the evidence of Agar, the accomplice, were confirmed and corroborated by other witnesses. Bat there his learned friend had stopped, and he had not explained to them the princi. ple which the judges invariably laid dowvn on such occasions. It was his (Serjeant Parry's) duty, therefore, a, once to state the principle of law on which he mainly relied, and he should quote one or two extracts from well-known textbooks in support of the view which he held. The principle which he sought to establish was thisthat an accomplice should be corroborated in his evidence, not merely as to the facts of the case, of which he himself no doubt weU knew the truth because he had been a participator in them; but that he should be corroborated also in reference to the " person" of the accused against whom he gave his evidence, and that he should be corroborated likewise in aU material and substantial particulars. He would now read to the jury an extract from a jadgment by Lord Abinger, in which that learned parson stated what was the law, or rather the rule of practice, on this subject. Lord Abinger said, in the case of a person who had been charged with an offence, and against whom an accomplice had been called:-
" I am strongly inclined to think that you will not consider the corroboration in this case sufficient. No one can hear the case without entertaining a suspicion of the prisoner's guilt * but the rules of law must be aDplied to aU men alike. it is a practice which deserves aU ihe reverence of law. The judges have uniformly told juries that they ought not to pay any respect to the testimony of an accomplice, unless the acconplice is corroborated in some material circumstances. Now, in my opinion, that corroboration ought to consist in some circumstance tbat affects the identity of the party accused. A man who has been guilty of a crime himself will always be able to relate the facts of the case, and if the confirmation be only of the truth of that history, without identifying the person, that is reaUy no corroboration at alL If a man was to break open a house and put a knife to your throat, and steal your property, it would be no corroboration that he had stated all the facts correctly, that he had described how the person did put a knife to the throat and did steal the property. It would not at all tend to show that the party accused participated in, it."p
The danger was, when a man knew that he was charged with an offence, that ho might endeavour to purchase immunity for himself by falsely accusing others. He was szure that the jury would see how cogently this applied to the case which they were nowconsidering. However, he should read one other short passage on which he strongly relied. Baron Alderson in a case of a similar character-" Iex v. Wilkes and Edwards"-said:-
" The confirmation of the accomplice as to the comnmission of the felony is really no confirmation at all, because it would be a confirmation as much if the accusation were against you and me. as it would he against those prisoners who are nowv upon their trial. The confirmation which I always advise juries to require is a confirmation of the accomplice in some fact which goes to fix the guilt on the particular person charged."
There again was the reiteration of the principle which he wished the jury to act upon, and Rfhich he trusted they would exouse him for pressing upon them so pertinaciously, because he felt that unless he succeeded in that it was hopeless for him to attempt to extricate his client from the situation in which he stood. Those two judgments contained the pith of the whole matter, and although he had intended to read a passage from a judgment of Mr. Justice Williams, who was, perhaps, one of the most eminent judges in the administration of the criminal law that ever sat upon the bench, he did not think it would be necessary to trouble them with it, as Justice Williams's language was but a repetition of what he had already read to them from Lord Abinger and Baron Alderson. Having thus endeavoured to explain the principle of the law which should gaide the jury, let them proceed calmly and dispassionately to consider the facts which had been brought forward. This was not a case in which any advocate could or ought to do more than calmly discuss the evidence, in order to ascertain whether, by the law and practice of the courts, that evidence brought home the charge to the persons accused. He was perfectly free to admit that his client, if guilty, had committed a grave and serious offence, and no doubt, if the jury should find him guilty, a mnost serious punishment would be attached to that offence. He believed, however, and trusted that he should be able to demonstrate to them that according to the law and the practice of the courts the evidence before them failed to substantiate his guilt. He was sure that he should not be misunderstood by the jury. It was not his intention to intrude a single personal observation upon them. His asseveratio2nof his belief in the innosence of the prisoner would be a great piece of folly and presumption ons his part. More eminent advocates than he was, or over should be, had, he believed, taken that course; and wrhen they had done so they had damaged both themselves and their client b.y it. The duty of theadvocate was plain and cleatr,-it was, by every fair and honousable and legitimate arGumont that he could use, upon the evidence that was before the jury, to endeavour to rescue his client, and to compel; the jury by the force of their own jsudgment to give a verdict of "I Not Gailty." That being his notion of the duty of an. advocate, he would nowr call attention to the history of tlis ciLse. 13 vwas sure that it would be imspossible by any epithet that h- could employ to. add to,the detestation which thay must all feel for the character of that man Agar. Rarely did they find entering a court of justice sach a man as Agar, having lived a course of crime and fraud of almost every description from the time that ho was 18 or 20 years of age. During that period the jury could have little dcabt that no had been engaged in a mest extonsive and bola system of plunder, and that he had been associated with ether men almost as bad as himself, not all of whom lhad yet beerL detected. The jury would know with whatr distrust to view the testimony of such a person, and he shzould therefore abstain fromu heapngu
any vituperative epithets upon Xr. Agar,-his owvn demeanour, his own features, his own life as ho had been compelled to reveal ii, his own aCts in this particular rob
bery, as he had caolly, audaciously, and impudently re. lated them, stampel his charater at once, and that character ho was sore thEy tboroughly understood. In addition to the fact that Agar was te planner and executor of this robbery, he had or pretended to bave, a personal animosity against Pierce; andho neaw sought to be let loose again upon society by giving this evidence. He (Ssrjeant Parry) wondered rikether the influenc of the South-Eastern Hailway Company would be sufficient toianduco the Goverument to let loose a crimndal like that again upon society. It was right tlat crime should be detected but it was not right
thaLt en situated like Agar should be encouraged and in-
ited, as he had been in this case, to make these rovelalions. He knew not whother we should have the happiness of claiming for ourselves the privilege of caling Mr. Agar
a free fellow-subject; he knew not whether he was again to be let loosv upon the world; but evidently that was one of the motives which operated upon
his rid; aud the other was a feqouing of great
pjWaigity tovwards the prisoner Pierc + 4a * %tLe. Con-
duct of Fierce towards that young woamt, FAnny Kay, madi ler child, it was imposible for any one to expla3fc it but himuself. He was entirely at the mercy of two persons without characterandfeeling, except the feeling of *uiMoAtty which they cherished towards him; but, foriunitely for iue, }Gr. Wontuer, his solicitor, had been cabled by his Lordship to make a statement with respect to thc3j000f., which *howed that instoad of that money having. been appropriatedasit was said ithhad been by Pierce, ithad been invested in Turkish bonds at Agar's own requ'est ready for hi- at any time he could have demanded it; and he believed the only persons who wisbed to get, at this moment, unlawfua possessionof that money were the SouthEastern Railway Cormpany, although he trusted they would not be successful in that attempt. He did not propose to go through Agar's aarrativa step by step, and should only allude to those pesages which related to Pierce - and he believed that he sbould demonstrate to them not only that there was not sufficient corroboration as affected that prisoner, but that there was an entire absence of corroboration, and in points, too, where, if he hal been implicated in the robbery, corroboration could easily have been obtained. First, as to the visit of Pierce and .Agar to Folkestone in 1854, that had been corroborated; but he did not see that any weight was to be attached to that circumstance. That Pierce knew Agar he had reason bitterly to remember, for without that knowledge he nover would have stood in that dock. No doubt tho two men had known each other for yeara; it was by no means improbable that they might have visited many places together for perfectly innocent purposes, and it was not to be presumed that they associated for criminal objects unless that were proved. They went to Folkestone, and walked about like any other persons; and no one corroborated what Agar had said relative to Pierce's getting possession of the key of the safe and Agar's taking the impression of it; not a soul saw that done. That Pierce and Agar wverg,,timate there could be no question, but in what their intiifcy consisted he knew not, andhedidnotthinkthatmere intiin5cy aloneshonldveigh very strongly with the jury. That was an element in the case which could not be overlooked he admitted, but he asked them to treat the acquaintance of Pierce with Agar, and their visit to Folkestone as harmless and innocent until they were proved to be otherwise by some better testimony than that of Agar. There was no doubt that Agar committed the robbery, and if he wished to convict Pierce of the crime nothing was easier than for him to associate Pierce with himself upon that visit to Folkestone, although Pierce might have been perfectly innocent of any criminaIl intention. Then came Agar's account of constant interviews with Pierce in London, of which there was not a shadow of corroboration. So, also, there was a long story told by Agar about obtaining possession of the key, of which there Was no corroboration whatever. Then, again, no one nroved the purchase of the shot by Pierce except Agar.
otwithstanding the multiplicity of visits which Agar said they had paid together to the railway station and to St. Thomas's.strect, the cabmen failed to identify Pierce; but evels if Pierce had been identified as accompanying him on one occasion, it by no means followed that he did so with a criminal intention, for there might have been scores of purposes perfectly innocent for which they min t have gone there together. At length the night amved upon which Agar and his associate, whoever he might have been, started upon their journey of plunder. On the 15th of May, 1S55, Agar went down by mail train to Dover; but wihat he did while he was riding in the train,
rhat he did at Dover, how he returned and with whom he returned, of his arrival in London and his return home, of the sale of the moneys by Pierce, and of every one of the circumstances which were really the leading circumstances of this robbery, and about which he (hIr. Parry) shouldmask the jury to apply the principle with which he had set outwith respect to all these points there was not a shadow of corroboration of the statement made by Agar. There was no proof that Pierce had been his companion upon that occasion or that he had had anything whatever to do with the matter. Bad, and tainted, and corrupted as Agar was they must beheve his own confession that he committed the robbery. Agar and his companion must have been seen by scores of persons, yet there was not one single individual who identified Pierce throughout the whole of this octurrence. And the jury must remember that they were not deciding whether Pierce had ridden in a cab with Agar; they were not deciding whether Pierce was intimate with Agar; but they were trying what took place from half-past S o'clock on the night of the 15th of May, 1855, when the Dover express started, until the time when it arrived in Dover, and they were endeavouring to ascertain whether Pierce was the companion of Agar on that journey of plunder, which no doubt would become memorable in the annals of crime. He submitted that there was not one tittle of corroboration in that respect. At Dover they stopped at an inn for two hours-from half-past 11 till half-past 1-they were seen by the two Clark-es, the landlord and the waiter, in strong gaslight, and yet there was no identification of Pierce. Pierce was by no means an ordinary-looking man; they passed through the station at 2 o'clock in the iLorning in such a man. iier as to attract the attention of three witnessesthey stayed 20 minutes on the platform; Agar ai
that he gave money there to a railway porter, and yet not one person ideutified l'ierce. They came to Lndon and went through the same ordeal, and still not a single witness identified Pierce. Two men no doubt were there ; but Pierce, although he had been in the service of the railwat company, and must have been known to many officers of the company, was not identified. Agar stated that Pierce had disguised himself with a wig and whiskers, and the only evidence in support of that statement was that a wig had been dressed for him in October, 1854. He did not -e what relevancy an occurrence so renuote could have to ihis particular charge. So again with regard to tho sale of the bulUon. It had been proved, no doubt, that the bullion had been sold, but it had not been proved that Pierce was the man who sold it. It appeartd to him to be almost miraculous, if Pierce were the man, how he, being known to the railway officers, should have passed them without being observed ; and there was no proof whatever that Pierce was disguised upon the night in questin, for the logic of a person who would say that because a man had a wig dressed in October, 1854, therefore he was disguised in it in May, 1855, although it mi'ht suit the brain of Agar, was not logic he imagined which would impose upon the jury, or wbich would induce them to say that there was an atom of corroboration of the statement of Agar, that Pierce was a co-operator and participator with him in this particular act. Upon their return to London carts were hired to carry the booty, stiU there was not a shadow of evideneo to co.nect Pierce with the hiring. Then came the story which Fanny Kay told them, and which she alone had told them. Now, wbo was Fanny Kay? It was very melancholy to think that one so young should have been so profligate as she evidently had been. It was melancholy to tbink what her character had been ; and then let him remind them that she was a woman, and that she sought to be revenged upon this man Pierce. Let hint remind them of that, and then ask them whether she was a witness on whon they could rely ? Had she not in all probabilty gone there with a fixed resolution to make good ber objectof revenge against Pierce? Did they beheve her story when she told them that her life had not been a life of impropriety ? He should be the last to say, because a girl had unfortunately fallen from the position which a virtuous woman always occupied in this conntry, that she was theref.re not to be believed upon her oath. God forbid ! But that was not the case of Fanny Kay. She had no doubt been immoral; he passed lightly over that, and touched lightly upon it; but he asked them to remeumber whose companion she had been for two years. His learned friend Serjeant Shee, with a face more innocent than bhis learned friend usually wore, in re-examining that girl, asked her whetber she had not had an honourable engagement witlh hIr. Hart, the gentlenian who when he came to town never saw her mother, but always saw her and who generally gave her two sovereigns, sometimes one-never less. Mr. Tress lsho had known her before, and Billy Barber likewise had been an acquaintance, although apparently a most innocent one. Sho was then introduced to Agar, according to his own account, as a perfeet stranger, and they lived together as nian and vife for two years; and with all that before hirm, his learned friend had the innocence, or assumedait, to re-examine her so as
to induce themrto believe that all her attachments were honourable. Agar was the participator in great crimes, sense of them acknowledged, but scores no doubt unaeknowledged. His mind, probably, at that moment was the depositary of the history of the crime of this metropolis and elsewhere for the last 20 years. He had visited America., where he said that he had " speculatedi ;" could tho Jury doubt that he had speculated in crime'! and he asksed them, could such si woman live with such a nian and remain unt%inted? She knew that his name was Agar after the birth of her childa- she was addicted to drunken habits; he aeked- again, condd such & woman live with such a mna, and reinain a pure-minded and honourable womau ? Pure she conld not be could she be a woman ef a trnthful nadreli.ble character? He should
asi the piry to say, with ro1ect to that furnace story which Agar bad told, that there was not a shadow of reliable corroboration of it. Fanny Kay was anxious, for what he
ksnerw, to obtain the release of Agar; she was far mor& an.xious to obtain the conviction of Pierce, and he had no doubt that she had coloeced- and axaggerated if she had not created the larger portion of her evidence. He admitted that Pierce wras frequently at Shepherd?s Bnuls, beeauso
Charlotte Painter stated that eke had seen lamL there * but as for anything thatwas done thero besides the " hlamiering" or ' knooking" there was no corroboratiou 'whatever. lie had heard morethan one enmineut judge say that there was a testimony on veliich a jury need not and ought not to act, andyet their noa-acting upor it did not impute wilful adi delberate perjury to tho person npon
whose testimony they did not so act. As regarded Fanny Kay, they mighb see that sbe was a malignant woman evidently, a-d that shA had a great objecttoDgain. Ha remembered Jaustice Erle saying that there was nothixg of which juries.should be so cautious as acting upon the testimony of a witness who had a particular object in view altogether beyond what was involved in the case. Fanny oay had that przticular object in viewv here, and it was one of the worst obects which a hunman being could seok to carry aut-it was revenge. Sho de.red to conviot and to punish and ih be revenged upon Pierce. Would they, then, act upon heb testimsony She had evidently becone doubl corrupted, Not only was she profigate, but she was ad-
dicted to habits of intoxication. That was a habit which tended to weaken the intellect both of man and woman-it was one of the most degrading vices that either sex could be guilty of, and every one must admit that its effect was to blind the moral sense, and to darken and to diminish the distintions between right and.wrong. He askedthemi,then.
to reject the evidence of FangSay as unworthy an4 unreiable, and to consider tha~t Asar and Kay were really one and the same personin this trial, and that they were both actuated by the same motives. That she was substantially the wife of that man Agar must be admitted, and it had been lid down that corro^oration by the wife of an r"Coa-
plice was not a corroboration which juries ought to ac npon. What more was there in this case I Pierchad
by the name of Peckham. Well, he was not there to defend Fierce either for associatirg with Agar or for assuming a false name; but there mighlt b financial embarrassments, I erhaps, rendering the useof a false name necessary, and which no one but Pierce himself could explain. Another fa:t which had been triumphatly relied upon by the prosec:tion was the possession of oue of the 100.-notes by Pierce, which note was the result, with five otbers, of the change for 600 sovereigns obtained at the Bauk of England on the 28th of May. That note was changed by Raffan for Pierce in the month of lTovember, 1856. At that time Agar had been arrested, and he asked tbe jury how they could say that that was not one of the notes which Agar had left with Pierce to be applied to the support of Kay? No other proceeds of this robbery had leen traced to Pierce, and if, as had been proved, Pierce had from time to time advanced to Fanny Kay from 801. to 1001., what more likely than that he should have changed the note i n question to supply her with money ? And if he changed it or that purpome, was not the whole of the cogency and value of that evidence in favour of his client ? Ratfan deposed that he had frequently seen Pierce with a large amount of mnoney, and that he knew that he had a large book upon tbe St. Leger in 1855, when Saucebox won. ie (Serjeant Parry) was informed that it was no uncommon thing for betting men to be worth 20,C00l. one day and to be beggars the next, and thereforeit was not difficult to understand that Pierce, who was a betting man, might be one day seen pawniag his shoes, and another in the possesion of plenty of money. Such occurrences he was informed were by`no teans rare, and he beheved that there was more roguery, fraud, swindling, and blackguardism in the betting-ring than in any part of Her Majesty's dominions. He beleved that the jury had now the whole case before them, and he hoped that he had made himself perfectly under. stood. If they believed Agar they must convict Pierce; if they beheved Fanny Kay there would be some evidence for them to consider; but he submitted that, even if they believed her, there was not sucfloient in her evidence which pointed directly to the personal act of Pierce in any crime whatever. It they looked to the rest of the evidence, there did not appear to be any confirmation shordtgza complicity in this crime. Confirmation as to occasionaljour? and visits and as to being seen in a publichouse now and then together, there was, but that showed nothing beyond the bare fact that Agar had been acquainted with this man, and it did not show any complicity in crince. In conclusion be asked them to be good enough to weigh carefully such observations as he had made as they thought were entitled to consideration, and to apply those observations to that rule of law, or that rule Which had all the reverence of lawv, and which was almost as binding as law, which he had pointed out. If they did that, and re5ected all external matter from their consideration, he be-
ieved that he was right in thinking that he had demonstrated to them that upon that principle they ought not to convict the man at the bar.
Mr. GIFFARD next addressed the Court on behalf ol Burgess. After expressing his general concurrence in the semarks of Serjeaut Parry with respect to corroborative evidence, a.nd urging also the necessity of corroboration with respect to each of the prisoners before them, he proceeded to test the credit which was to be attached to Agar's staement. Observing in passing that Agar's character was so bad that it was impossible to blacken it-that he was there endeavouring to make capital out of his formter crimes, and that Iefuting the adage that there was " honour among thieves " he was endeavouring to escape punishment or to avenge himself by the betrayal of his accomplices, the learned counsel went on to say that he did not deny that Aga-s story that he stole the gold might be true. It might be true that he had been meditating the crime for years and endea. votring to corrupt the railway servants, and that in the steady pursuit of that object he had scraped an acquaint. ance with some of them, and hadbeen seen from time to time in their company; and there could be no doubt that the
onsequence of such an acquaintance was thstl the prisoners at the bar were placed in some degree of periL Suppose, however, that instead of Burgess, Agar had fixed upon Sharman as having been an accomplice, and had told them in a detailed form that Sharman bad permitted him to take an impression of the keys in wax, and suppose that Sharman-admittedly an innocent man-stood at that moment at the bar, in what position would he have been different from that which Burgess was then in forSharman had been seen at the hotel taking refreshments with them ? One geeat inconsistency as it appeared to him in Agar's story was, that there did not appear to be any necessity for his employment in the matter at all. Pierce was stated to be the sug7esterof the robbery; Burgess was a guard in the employ of the company, and he might have lived at Folkestone if he had liked, where he could have ascertained without suspicion everything that it was requisite to know about the key of the bullion safe; Tester was the person who was alleged to have got possession of the key in London after the locks went to Messr. Chubbs to be re-combined; and he (Mfr. Giffard), therefore, was reaUy at a loss to see what it was that Agar did which the others, if they were aU implicated in it could not have done just as well without him. Agar stated that, in order to fit the keys, he went down in the train with the bullion-chest upon six or seven different occasions. It had been elicited in crossexanmination that the buUion-chest only went down by the train of which Burgess was guard when it -was too late for the tidal service train; and surely the company must know the occasions on which in the months of April or Mlay the bullion-cheat went dow n with Burgess; yet there was no testimony to corroborate Agar in the sLightest degree respecting his statement of going down with the chest six or seven different times to fit the key. Surely that was a circumstance of materiality which the jury would expect to find corroborated if Agar's evidence were true, because he could scarcely get into the guard's van npo all those occasions without having been seen bysomeof Ute porters orthe underguard. Another remarkable circumstance' was that Agar nad never told them what he had done with.the key which he pretended to have made from the wax impression. lie had told them how he had disposed of the hammer and of the chisel, and the hay and the shot; but he had said nothing about the key. If the key had been produced any locksmith could have told them whether it was the original key which had been made for the box, or whether it had been filed from a blank key and taken from a wax impression. It was not likely that such a circumstance would haveescaped Agar'smind, and whathe (bir.Giffard) submitted was, that the key which the captain of the vessel had lost, Agar by some extraordinary coincidence had found. Agar being compeUed to fix the scene of the robbery somewhere fixed it in the train; but might it not have occurred
just as easily during the two hours and a-half that the I 7OX was at the station or on the quay waiting for the boat? It was true that there was a watchman there, who said that he watched the box; but, if the watchman and Burgess changed places, would not Burgess declare, as stoutly as the watchman had done, that hIe had kept a vigilant eye upon the bullion-box during the Journey from London, and that no one had touched it ! He did not for a moment say that the watchman was an accompce in the robbery, but he thought it extremely likely that his vigilance might have been evaded. He presumed that the bullion-box was a thing from its appearance likely to attract attention; and instead of the times of its departure being kept a secret, as was pretended by the officers of the company, it appeared that the time of the train by which it was going was, in the ordinary course of businees, ohalked upon it in large letters. Surely then persons intent upon committing a robbery, knowring that the bullion-box was going down to a solitary seaport by a particular train, might concoct some plan to lull the vigilance of the watchman during the two or three hours that the box was to remain at that place. Now, if Agar's evidence were true, let them consider whether in the progress of the train on the night in question there would be any ineans of corroborating him. The only person from whom he (xr. Giffard) had endeavoured to eLicit any. thing was not a desirable witness; it was Kennedy, the under-guard. He did not mean thereby that he was an accomplice of Agar's, but he was evidently desirous to make the case penrectly conclusive, and, in spite of the hint which he obtained from his learned friend Mr. Bodkin early in the examination in chief, he was much " too clever." Kennedy mzight have told them at how many stations Burgess had to get out, what he had to do at those stations, whom he would see there, and so on. Instead of that Kennedy said, " From the moment I got in to the moment I got out of the train I never saw anything of Burgess." When asked who gave Burgess the sigual to go on, he replied "Why, I diI." Ee was asked, "Didn't yoa see khm then7l" "No, I gave him the signal by a light." Againhe was as ed, "Didn't you see Burgess when he gave you the answer ?" "Yes; at least I saw a light, but I did not know whether Burgess held it or not." Now he (Ur. Giffsrd) submitted that that was not the proper mode of giving evidence in such a case as this, because, but for the crossexamination, it would have left the impression that Burgess was working away in the van with Agar during the whole of the journey down. Again, there was this difficulty in thecase. The mail train stopped at a certain number of stationsi not all. Now, if Agar and Burgess were in the break van on the seven or eight occasions to which Agar had spoken, he wanted to know where it was that they got out? At Dover there were porters always in attendance to take the luggage, and if Agar had got out of the guard's van at the station would it not have created remark? This was evidently felt to
be a diticulty by Agar, and he had therefore avoidedthe topic. On the night of the robbery there were three'of them in the guard's van, because Pierce got in at Reigate. If three persons thdn got out 6f the van at the station must it not have led to inqutry, and would not the jury have expected some evidence on that subject ? Agar had left that part of the hstory a blank, although it afforded ample room for corroboration if the story w;ere true. Williams and Witherden were called to show that two men answering the description given by Agar of himnself and Pierce went back to london by the train that night. That might be true. Those might have been the two persons for all he (Mr. Giffard) knew to the contrary; but it was singular that those two witnesses statsd that Kennedy, the underguard, and Burgess, the prisoner, were standing in the room facing them at the time those two men went throuagh, and that ftar did not mnention one word upon the subject.
t he put to them was that in every circumstance in which Burgess was concerned there was an entire absence of corroboration. Tester was well-known by tho officials of #e railway at leigate, yet no ozle had been caled to con-Im A gar's statement that Tester lurked about on the down side of the line at that station for the purpose of receiving the bar of gold. It was admitted that the acquaintance 'between Burgesaand Agar was very slight; and, although Fanny Kay had beon itntroduced to Agar by Burgess, slhe
ever once saw Burgess during the whole two years during which she lived with the approve;r. This circumstance could not well be reconcilefd with the alleged fact that Burgess was concerned in the robbery, and *aa, indeed, the principal actor in the drama, without whom, os guard of the train, the crime could not have been comamitted. If that had been so, surely he would have been seen some time or other by Fanny Bay in Agaes company, while arranging their plans for the robbery, or while eonversing about the distribution of the booty after its commis-
sion. Burgess had not be traced by any witness as having been in Agar's company after the robbery, and they were asked to beiieve that the firat time he saw Agar after the crime was completed was in August, when the fruits of the plunder were divitied among the four accomplices. Itwas not inaccordance with human nature that am an who hadron such risks for spoil should be so indifferent aboutgetting.his share of it as not to go and look after his confederates' proceedings during the long interval between May and August. There could be no doubt thatthe appro'er Agarhad played a very ingenious part; yet the cleverest of his fratermty were sometimes led into mistakes. It so happened that in Agas statement there was a remarkable discrepancy of nolessthan 2201. between the amount of the proceeds of the robbery and the aggregate sum divided among the four persons concerned in it. That was a fact tending to throw discredit upon Agar's evidence. The assertion that 6001. in gold was changedatthe Bank for an equal sum in notes also bore the stamp of extreme improbability. Was it to be believed that persons trained in crime, who had got gold coin, which could not be traced, as the fruits of their robberies, would be likely to exchange it for bank-notes, for tracing which there were such facilities? It was not alleged that it wvas Burgess who obtained these notes at the Bank, and little weight could therefore be attached to the circumstance of some of them coming into his possession eight or nine months afterwards. As to Burgess having bought soue Turldsh bonds, it only proved that by a successful speculation he was able to clear the sum of 601. The guard of a train had many opportunities of knowing the state of the market, and, hearing that those bonds were "up," he might reasonably have 'thought it a good time for dealing in them. Burgess bad been about 13 years in the service of the company, and might well have been a richer man if all his spe. culations had succeeded. The statement of Agar that Burgess came out of the station on the night of the robbery and wiped his face-the preconcerted signal that " all was nght-' was wholly uncorroborated; and as to Burgess's havir,g been seen with Pierce and Agar at the Marquis of Granby, it was not to be supposed that Burgess would have gone to meet them at a publicbouse, where everybody might go in and out, n order to plan a robbery. when Messrs. Abell and Co. made their claim for compensation the railway company resisted it from May to September, on the ground that the gold must have been abstracted in France, and not in England; ;yet all this time the company knew that the shot whieh was substituted by the thieves for the bu}lion -was Englishmade, and not French. The legal advisers of the company instituted an inquiry immediately after the robbery, and Burgesa was then examined. Why had not Burgess's statement been produced in that court, that the jury mieht have comparea it with Agar's story, and then drawn their own conclusions accordingly ? Instead of that, however, the whole transaction had been "bottled up" for 18 months by the company, and Burgess had been most unfairly deprived of the legitimate means of making good his defence. Agar was a man who had been steeped in crime from his earliest years, while Burgess, on the other hand, was a man of honest character and a diligent and faithful servant, who had up to the present time maintained the confidence of his employers, by whom he was retained in his responsible situation of guard long after the robbery. It was for the jury to say whetherthey would depend upon the evidence of a witness like Agar; but he humbly submitted that the case was not one free from all reasonable doubt, that Burgess was therefore entitled to the benefit of his previous good character; and he confidently relied that his client would meet with an
acquittal.
Mr. Serjeant BALLAINTLE then addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner Tester. Having implored them to dismiss from their minds all that they had learnt of this case from the newspapers and other extraneous sources, he expressed his deliberate conviction that whatever might be the amount of trustworthy evidence adduced at that trial much remained behind, which, if disclosed, would throw most important light on the question they were investigating, and much had also been introduced that had been invented and applied with an ingenuity perfectly devilish, but which the careful scrutiny of honest and unprejudiced minds would unravel and defeat. The prisoner Tester had been many years a clerk in the ser vice of the South-Eastern Railway Company, holding an onerous and well-remunerated situation, and being the son of a man of substance and respectability. He lefb this company's employ in the year 1856, taking with him the highest possible character, and entered upon an office equally responsible and more lucrative in the service of a railway company in Sweden. In the latter position he remained until he heard, through the usual channels of information, of the charge brought against him by the approver Agar; upon which he returned at once to this country, threw himself upon its justice, inviting a full investigation of his conduct; and now he abided the issue. If he was really a dishonest man, undoubtedly he was also a bold one; for, instead of staying in Sweden, where he would at least have been free, he bad preferred to place himself voluntarily within the reach of punishment, and now stood of his own accord in the felons' dock. Upon a man like Agar he (the learned counsel) would not lavish epithets. He was, by his own admission, a scoundrel, and a scoundrel of no ordinary stamp. As a psychological phenomenon his character deserved careful study. According to his own account of himself he was 41 years old; and the only part of his life of which hewasashamnedandwhichhesought tohidewasthe three years of wasted honesty during which he held a humble situation, and did not sully his hands with renewed crime. His general career, marked by masterly contrivance and perverted forethought, was that of a devilish tempter of mankind-of a man who, not content with carrying his crime on his own shoulders, and gaining a livelihood by them, wandered through society to corrupt its honesty and pollute everthing that came within his accursed touch. No more terrible scourge could be let loose upon society than would flow from the liberation of such a miscreant. At the commission of what baseness would he be likely to hesitate if he thought he might thereby shorten the term of his own incarceration? To secure mercy for himself he would not shrink from destroying th- happiness, the reputation, or the liberty of the innocent. The honesty towards each other proverbial even among thieves was a weakness that he had left far behind, Bult he had a livelihood to gain when he should emer e from Portland prison, through the instrumentality of the South-Eastern Railway Company, and he would therefore be only too glad to screen any acomplce who could divulge deeds of his such as the last penalties of the law could alone expiate at the expense of an innocent man who had incurred his malignant revenge for no deeper offence than that of resisting his diabolical seductions. The disclosures of Agar had been ascribed to the fact that his compassionate love for that sweet and sentimental young lady, the mother of his child, had been keenly wounded through the unkind treatment she had experienced from Pierce hut w hen the matter came to be sifted it turned out that the infamous approver had deserted the woman to whom he was so tenderly attached, and had taken up with another, with whom he lived for some time before being taken into costody. There was no imimorality-no species of villany in which he had not revelled, and his whole ambition would indeed seem to have been to show himself a worthy head of the noble guild of scoundrels. What would such a lieartless wretch care if his innocent victims were pining in pnson provided he himself was at large enjoying the society of his Fanny Kays and Fanny Campbells, and living by the spoliation of the public? The able argument of his learned friend (Mr. Giffard) had shown pretty conclusively the absence of satisfactory proof that the robbery was committed in the manner stated by the approver, and it was unneces*ary, therefore, to travel over that ground again. But what he (the learned serjeant) charged against Agar was, that ho had fabricated a story based upon certain facts entirely independent of this case, which he easily picked up through nis knowledge of Burgess, Tester, and the other offlicers of the company, and upon these immaterial facts he had fixed as a means of confirming the accusation against Tester wlhich he had ingeniously engrafted upon them. For example, having learned from the railway officials that Tester came up from Beigate with a black bag, what was there to prevent his inventing the untruth that that bag had been taken by Tester for the express purpose of bringing up the bars of gold? Andhow was t possible for the prisoner to contradict that statement? Again, Agar knew that Tester was a Rerson manifestly pointed out by his situation as likely to have access to the keys of the bulhon-cbest, and his knowledge of this fact enabled him to pass off his story about Tester giving him possession of the keys to take an impression of them. So, likewise, having fixed on the railway as the scene of his version of the robbery, he was obliged to implicate the guard in its commission. Again, it was said that Tester and Agar were seen frequently together, and took tea and wine together This might be very tue; but then Tester did not know Agar's character at that time; and was it not very probable that all this while A gar was end eav ouring, but with out success, to indon ofw the kbeks of thtSe bulSlion-nche 5over which hen kmn,,
tue prisoner bad some control? The jury could not have forgott-en that Agar swore positively that he was innocent of
the crime for which ho ad lately been convictd and that he was found guiltv through the false tesftiony of an accomplice. Bj this statement Agar was either committing deliberate perjury or he presentod in his own person a terrible example of the danger arising from juries attaching undue weight to the fabricated evidence of accomplices. The learned counsel then remarked upon the scanty evidence adduced as to Tester's control over tne keys of the bullion-chest. It was stated that the keys were sent by Mr. Chubb to .1r. Brown, the superintendent; - and it was reasonable to suppose that the latter gentleman locked tbem up safely in his own drawer. If he had not done so he would no doubt have been called as a witness to prove the fact. It was alleged that Agar and Kennedy were continued as guards of the 8 p.m. down train for more than one month through the intervention of Tester. If there was any irregularity in this proceeding-and it had been shown that there was none, such extensions of a guard's time beiag not unusual-the blame for it rested with the superiorofficer who witnessed the prisoner making the alteration in the list. Agar might easily have gleaned the circumstance of Burgess being kept on the train for May, and makeuse of it to bolster up the wholetissue of his other wicked inventions. Again, it wasnotpretended tbatTester wasseenwith theblack bag on the night of the robbery. All that was proved was that he was seen somewhere about the time of its commission. Surely that simule fact of itself was no sufficient ground for the inferesce that he had a portion of the pI-
uer in his possession. Morwover, was it to be credited fora moment that, if such had been the contents of the black hag he would bave been so foolhardy as to go out of his way to attract observation by proceeding to thie Greenwich Railway station, instead of going quietly at once to his own
residence and biding the stolen property? But that was not all; be actually went up to the booking-clerk, volun-
tarily engaged in conversation with bins, forced upon his attention the fact that he had been to Reigate and back since office hours, put down the blaok bag with the bar of gold (as was said) in it, and went away -for nearly 10 minutes, leaving the bag behind him until he returnea to take his place in the train. No criminzal, unlesm he were positively insane and determined not to escaps detection, could have acted in this mnatter, as Tester was represented to have done. Agar might somehow have obtained a knowledge that the prisoner came up from Beigate with a black bag, and then pounced upon it as a further means of giving the semblance of confirmation to his story of Tester's complicity in the robbery. It certainly had the appearance of fitting very neatly-perhaps too neatly-into his tale; but whether it had been made so to fit by Agar's own fertile invention, or by Tester's conduct, the jury would have to decide for themselves. Then with regard to the division of the plunder. It was stated that Tester accepted some Spanish bonds from Ac-ar as his share in the fruits of the crime. Was it to ba believed that Tester would have run the risk of robbing his employers for the sake of two or three Spanish bonds-worth something, perhaps, to-day, and nothing at all to-morrow-when he could have hard cash in Engsh.sovereigns instead? This fiction was too transparent to deceive sensible men. The truth was Agar must have come to know that the prisoner had been dealing in Spanish bonds, and then he tried to make it be believei that Testergot them from him. This was another samnle of the mode in which the approver had manufactured his confirmatory evidence. As to the alleged changing of 600 sovereigns into six lOOt.-notes, the story bore the im preas of a lie upon the very face of it, 'and was evi-
ently trumped up to give effect to his other base. machinations. Thieves might be desirous of chana- - ing notes into gold. - but who' ever heard of their having themadneas to change gold, so easily convertible aud so dirttcult to' be traced, into banknotes, which afforded so many facilities for detection? He (the learned serjeant) charged him with being the concoctor of appearances against his chent. The notes were never in Tester's hands at aU; nor did he write his name upon them. His name had been forged, perhaps not by Agar himself, but by his ready agents. at infamous approver had shown himself capable of such a detestable deed-he was connected with tha nctornous "Jem Saward " and that organized and gigantic system of forgeries and frauds which had so recently startled the commercial community. Agar bad been a forger all his life-his plots had had their ramifications in America as well as in Europe, and they had extended over more than 20 years, during which penrod he had contrived almost nmraculously to escape detection. The learned counsel in conclusion maintained that no confirmatory proof had been adduced of the approver's testimony against his client, and earnestly appealed to the jury not to allow a man who had hitherto borne a high and. unimpeachable character to be the vidtim of the foul machinations of one who sought his ruin.
Mr. Baron IARTuz then. proceeded to sum up the evidence. He said,-Gentlemen of the jury, my learned brother and myself are both of opinion that the prisoner Pierce cannot be convicted on the first counlt, which charges him with larceny as a servant, seeing that at the timne of the robbery he had ceased to be a servant of the company. The only offence, therefore, of -ihich he can be found guilty is simple larceny. With regard to Burgess and Tester, however, the case is different. They were both servants of the company, and were placed in situations of trust. You have been very properly desired to dismiss from your attention all the remarks which have been made by the press in reference to this trial, and I also will make that request o you, though I have no doubt thab the evidence which you have listened to during the last two days must have made a much greater impression on your minds than anything which you have read in the newspapers. This case, it has been trnly said, is one of the greatest public importance. It is one of a class which has unfortunately become very numerous of late, and for which I think the Legislature ought speedily to make some special provision, where the great joint-stock companies which have come into existence in such numbers within the last quarter of a century have been plaundered by their confidential servants. It seems as though the feeling of attachment and fidelity which ought to exist between clerk and employer is wholly wanting in the case of these companies, and they appear to be regarded as a public spoil. This case rests mainly, no doubt) on the evidence of an approver. To use his own expression, Agar is, and has been for years, "a professional thief," and he was known to the prisoners as such. Re was no common thief, however. Before he engaged in this transaction he was in the possession of 3,0001. stock, besides Spanish bonds to the extent of 7001., and he appea:s to have been applied to on account of his great professional skill to undertake this business, just as one would apply to a great physidan or a great lawyer, or any man of great professional reputation for assistance in his particular walk. My learned brother Shee told you very proper'y at the beginning of this case, that, for the purpose of convicting anyone on the evidence of an approver, it is necessary that he should be corroborated by other witnesses. If you are convinced from the evidence of other witnesses that the story which Agar has told is a true story, if you are of opinlon that there are circumstances connecte I with it which must have happened, and which he cannot have invented, and that the minute details which he ha3 narrated have been corroborated by independant witness. s with whom he can have had no communication, and over whom he can have had no control, then it is undoubtedly your duty to find the prisoners guilty; but, if you have any doubt upon these points, then you must acquit them. Agar was arrested on the 15th of August, 1855, and he was con. victed at the October Sessions at this Court, and from that time he has had no possible opportunity of making up a concerted story with anyone, nor indeed is there anyone o' the witnesses, except Easny Kay, who would be likely ta enter into communication with him on the subject, Hi
motiveforcoming forward now is perfectly clear. He is actuated byaviolent feeling of animosity against the prisoner Pierce for the breach of trust which he committed in appro. priating to himself the 3,0001. intended for the support of Fanny Kay and the child. Revenge is his objec%Against Burgess and Tester he appears to have no feeling of animosity, and it wiUl be for you to consider how far he would be likely, if his story were a false one, to inculpate two persons who do not appear to have given him any cause of offence. My learned brother Shee contended that even if Agar's evidence were struck out altogether there w-s still a case to go to the jury against all the prisoners. I think my learned brother erred there as respects Pierce and Tester. Against them there would be no case, I think, without Agar's statement, but against Burgess I am of opinion that there would be evidence to go to the jury even if Agar had notbeen examined. If you are of opinion that the robbery took place between London and Folke. stone-of which I think the evidence leaves very little doubt-then comes the question how could it have been committed without Burgess's knowledge, seeing that his Station was in the compartment in which the gold was carried? But with regard to the other two, I am of opinion that there would be no case if you disbelieve Agar's story. SubstantiaUy, however, the case against all the three pri. soners rests upon Agae's evidence, and it will be your dn!y carefully to consider that evidence, not starting with the assumption that it is false, but looking at it withgreatsusp - cion, and noting how?ar itis corroboratedby the evidenceof independent witnesses. If you are then of opinion that it is so completely confimed in aU its important points by the testimony of persons with whom he can have ad, no communication and no opportunity of concerting a story as to make it perfectly certain that his account of the mode In which this robbery was committed is true, then it will be your duty to find the prisoners guilty. The le4rued Baron then went through the whole of Agar's evidence, pointing out those portions in which it was corroborated by other witnesses. His account of the visits of himself and Pierce to Folkestone wasconfirmedby Mrs. Hooker, atwhose house they lodged on 'heir first visit; of Hazel, the police inspector at Folkestone, who had watched them; and of Sharman, Chapman, and Ledger. Chapman's evidence in particular as to the receipt of the parcel of gold by Agar at Folkestone, and his pretended inability to write a receipt, because of his wounded finger, agreed in every particular with Agar's statemen;, Agar said he had been informed by Tester that one of the keys of the iron safe had been lost and that It had been sent to Messrs. Chubb to have the lock altered, and this was confirmed by Mr. Chubb, who produced the correspondence relating to this transaction, which was in Tester'shand. writing, showing that Tester was acquainted with this circunmstance, which it was not likely would have been
generally known among the company's servants, In liko manner, the unusual circumstance of Burgess act. ing as guard to the mail train so much longer than his regular term of duty (during which time Agar was goiug up and down the line fitting the key to the safe), was shown to have been arranged by Tester himself. Tester was shown to bave travelled on the line from Red-hill to London that night, and to have had a little black bag with him, by the testimony of Jones and Russell, just as -was alleged in Agar's story; and Agar's account of the return of Pierce and hini.
Felf from Dover to London by the 2 o'clock train was co a. firmed in all particulars by the waiter at Dover and the porters at the Dover and London stations. Agar's descrip tion of the manner in which the gold had been carried Zrom the station and melted down was confirmed by the evidence of tho cabmen and the carter, and also by Mr. Bees, who found the firebricks behind the grate, the burnt flooring at Agar's old residence, and the box of tools at Pierce's. The evidence of the Bank clerks respecting tho Bix 1001.-notes, and of the stockbrokers, of Lee, the stockjobber, and of Steam, the publican, were all confirmatory of Agar's evidence as to the division of the plufder; and the Spanish bonds, of which Agar bad spoke¢r, had been in the same manner traced to the pessesslon of the prisoner Pierce, and of Tester's father. EVing thus pointed out those parts of Agrs evidence which were confirmed by other witnesses the - learned Baron dismissed the jury at a few minutes to 5 o'clock to consider their verdict.
After an absence of little more than 10 minutes the jurreturned into court, and the foremazn delivered in the:r
verdict, Guilty on the second count (simple larcency) against Pierce, and Guilty on the fir3t count again3t Bnrgess and Tester.
The prisoners having been placed at the bar for judg. ment,
Mr. Baron MAItTrw proceeded to deliver the sentence of the Court. Addressing the prisoners he said,-Yom, Witliam Pierce, James Burgess, and George William Te3ter, have all been convicted, upon pretty nearly the most conclusive evidence which it was possible to lay before a jury, of the offence with which you were charged. The man Agar is a man 'who is as bad, I dare say, as bad can be, bnt that he is a man of most extrarodinary ability no rperson who heard him examined can fora moment deny. I do not entertain a doubt that it was because he was an old, experienced thief, noted for his extraordinary skill, that he was applied to by you for the purpose of getting this robbery effected by his instramentality. Something has been said of the romance connected with that man's character, but let those who fancy that there is anything great in it consider his fate. It is obvious, as I have said, that he is a man of extraordinary talent; that he gave to this and, perhaps, to many other robberies, an amount of care and perseverance one-tenth of which devoted to honest pursuits must have raised him to a respectable station in life, and considering the commercial activity of this country daring the last 20 years would probably have enabled him to realize a large fortune. But look at the consequences of hi./ career of crimo. Insbead of being a respected wealthy man, as he might have been, he is a slave for life-separat for ever from all he holds most dear. It is perfectly clear that he was fond of associating with pereons of the other sex, but he is entirely cut off from aU sach associations. He is condemned to a wretched and miserable life. He is dealt with as a complete slave, and has no mnore control over his own actions that the veriest slave than bas existed since the world began. I did not think it right to notice, whle the trial was going on, the observations which were made by counsel on the probability of his getting his discharge as the price of the evidencehe has given hero to day. That is entirely in the breast of the Crown ; we have nothing to do with it; but it does not at aU follow as a matter of course, that a man of his character will be released fram prison because he has given evidence which has had the effect of bringing you to justice. He has related to us the various circumstances of this robbery, and has narrated minute details which have been confirmed by up.
wards of 30 witnesses with whom it was perfectly impossible that he could have had any communication. Ie could not bave told as those details except his story had been a true one; and, for my own part, I believe every word of his evidence from beginning to end. On you, Pierce, I am un. fortunately compeUed to inflict a punishment less severe than upon the other prisoners. They were servants of the company, and you were not. By a strained construction of the law you might, perhaps, have been got into the same category with the other two ; but I am unwilling, and my brother WiUes agrees with me, to strain the law against you. But I do declare that if I stood in that dock to receive
sentence I should'feel more degraded to be in your place than in that, even, of either of your associates. You had been long connected with this man Agar; he trasted yoU, and he gave you 3,0001. stock to be invested for the benefit of his child and its mother, together with 6001., his share of the produce of this robbery, apd the rest of the gold which had not been sold. In all you must have got out of him about 15,0001. This you stole and appropriated to your own use. It is a worse offence, I declare, than the act of which you have just been found guilty. I would
rather have been concerned in stealing the gold than in the robbery of that wretched v'oman,-call her harlot, if youwiM,-and herchild. A greatervillainthan you are, I beheve, does not exist. (This strong language was received by the audience with a loud burst of applause.) I greatly regret that I have it not in my power to inflict a heavier punishment upon you; butthe heaviest sentence which the law allows for your offence I will pass upon you, and that is that you be imprisoned, with hard labour, for the space of two years, a-d that during three months of that time-the ist, 12th and 24th month-you be kept in solitary confinement. As for you, Burgess and Tester, there is no manner of doubt that your caseisthat-notunfrequent
of late-of menwho, havinggood characters, andbeingplaced by your employers in situations of trust, were unable to resist the temptation of getting possession of a large sum of money all at once. Whether Agar tempted you or whether you were tempted by Pierce, as is most likely, and that then Agar was applied to as a man noted for his skill and ability in such matters, it is impossible for us to know now. That you Burgess; a man who had been 15 years in the service of the company, and were receivlng good wages, and that you Tester, the son of a most respectable man, should have yielded to this temptation, is greatly to be deplored; but we should be departing from our duty to the public, particularly after what we
bave seen taking place during the last few months, the robbery of the Crystal Palace Company and other offences of a similar nature, if we did not visit you with the severest punishment. You knew 'whenyouengaged in the commission of this crime that, though if you were
Eucessful, it would place you in the possession of a large sum of money, yet that if you were detected you 'would be
liable to the severest punishment. You were willing to play the game,and you must pay the forfeit. The learned counsel who have addressed the jury on your behalf have spoken in the strongest terms of Agar's character. No doubt he deserves all they have said, but let it be said in his favour that he remained true to you, that he said not a word about this robbery unti he heard of Pierce's base conduct. As he gave his evidence he did not appear to feel towards you that bitter animosity which was so clearly manifested in him, and, I must say, not unnaturally, under the circumstances, towards Pierce, He had no motiye to aecuse you falsely, and this to my mind is
an additional proof of the truth of his story. The sentence of the Court upon you, Burgess and Tester, is that you be severally transported beyond the seas for the term of 14 years.
The prisoners received their sentenee without any change of demeanour, and were immediately removed from the bar.
Mfr. BODKIN, addressing Mr. Baron Martin said, in reference to his Lordship's observations on the possibility of Agar's release, it was only justto Mr. Rees, the soliitor for the prosecution, to mention that, when he saw Agar at Portland, he had distinctly stated to him that he was not to expect any remission of his sentence in return for the evi-
dence vhich he had consented to give. The learned counsel at the same time applied to the Court that the property found in the possesion of the prisoners should be h anded over to the South-Easterm Railway Company.
Mr. Baron MA RTIN declined to make any such order at present. The Turkish bonds found in the possession of Pierce had been clearly purchased with the money en-
trustedto tothe prioner by Agar, and if he had the power he should certainly order those bonds to be handed over to Fanny Kay.
- Mr. BODKI said, the company had no desire to take possession of any property which was not the produce of the robbery.
Mr. Baron M.usRiN said that, if the solicitor for the prosecution would specify on affidavit what property they thought themselves entitled to, he and Mr. Justice Willes would then make whatever order seemed right to them under the circumstances.

Naturalization.
ZATUBALIZATION.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The subject of naturalization having been of late much discussed in the columns of Tile Times, and it being a subject of very grave imn rtance to many who, though born in a foreign dime, have ben for years most true and faith. ful subjects to Her Majesty the Queen of England, will you allow me to offer a few remarks upon it ?
The question appears tome so clear and simple that I am astonished that any doubt could ever have arisen about it.
I have my certificate of naturalization before me, which I received in 1845, after a 10 years' residence in England, signed by Sir James Graham, the then Secretary of State for the Home Department.
After stating my name, occupation, residence, and length of residence in England; my having presented to him, James Robert George Graham, a memorial to grant me a certificate of naturalization; and his having inquired into the truth of the allegations contained in such memorial, it concludes with the following clear and distinct words' Now, in pursuance of the power and authority given to me, as Secretary of State, by the said act, I hereby grant to the aforesaid -, upon his taldng the oath prescribed by the said act, aU the rights and capacities of a naturalborn British subject, except the capacity of being a member of the Privy Council or a member of either House of Par. Hiaaent."
Now, it appears to me, if there is any meaning at all in the above words, it is this-that I have made a simple, though very solemn contract, with the British Government.
I have taken tbe oath of allegiance to Qaeen Victoria, her heirs, and successors, &c., and, in retarn for this, the British Government has given me aU the rights and capacities of a natural-born British subject except the three named in the certificate.
I cannot bring myself to believe that it ever can be the intention of any British Government either to break, or by sabterfuges to creep out of so solemn a contract.
I, for one, shall claim all the rights and capacities of a natural-born British subject where and when I may require them, as secured to me by my certificate of naturalization, and I am convinced that every honest Englishman will a,ree with me that I am justified in doing so.
I enclose my card, and beg to subscribe myself a very faithful though naturalized

''ee circumstances whioh gave rihe to this petition were as folows:-TJohn Tharp, the testator in the CDuse, by wiU dated March, 1801, de*ised certain estates in the island of Jamaica to trLstees, for the benefit of his grandson, John Iharp the younger, for his life. Among sucb. estates was one caUld Lansquinet, which was charged with an annuity of 1,2001. current money of Jamaica to the widow of the testator, under a marriage sattlement dated October, 1794. The first suit for the administration of the testator's estates was instituted as far back as the year 1805. In the year 1816 John Tharp, the grandson, was found a lunatic by inquisition, and has continued so down to the present time. The sugar plantations have been carried on by the different consignees appointed by the Court at an enormous loss, and their claim now amounts to a sum exceeding 200,0004 The Lansquinet estate and the income arising from the slave compensation fund awarded to it were insufficient topnaythe annuity of 1,2001.

'Upon proceeding to take such accounts, it appeared that the consignees' accounts had been passed in lunacy between the 24th of May, 1818, and the 30th of April, 1847 and a question was raised whether such accounts ought to be received as evidence of the proper payment by the consignees and managers of the several disbursem ents therein set down, or whether the accounts ought not to be retaken, inasmuch as the parties interested in the estates in remainder were not present at the passing of sudli accounts, and had not, therefore, had any opportunity of checking them.

Mr. BACON (Mr. W.

Such an order did not authorize her to prosecute an appeal in a different branch of the court without a next friend.
Mr. SxLwyy, on perusing the order, admitted that it was necessary to have a next friend appointed, and offered Mr. Parker, one of the defendants, and who had assented, for immediate appointment.
Mr. BAcoN objected, and after some discussion,
The LoRD CANC&i Lor. ordered the appeal to stand over for one week, for the appointment Of a next friend, the defendants solicitor undertaking to pay the costs of the day; the plaintiff to have leave till Saturday to give a notice of motion to remove the proposed next friend.

BONILL V. KEYWORTH AND OTHERS,
The plaintiff in this action, George Hinton Bovill, Was an engineer in Abchurch-lane, in the city, and he sued the defendants, Messrs. Keyworth and Co., millers at Lincoln, to reeover damages. for the infringement of a patent granted to the plaintiff in June, 1849, for certain. imiprove. mnents in the manufacture of wheat and other graini into m3eal and flour. At the triat which took place befo; Lorld Campbell, at Gunildhall onk the 4th and 5th of JunNIX it aered that in the od method of grinding cor a consi=erable amount of heat was generated by the friction of the twomillstonesuponeachotherundera heavypressure. The flour thus became heatedand deteriorated, and it was elhonecessary todelay forsometine theprocessof dre3sine
The object of the plaintiff's invention was. to preserve te qult fthe flour and to expedite the dressing proces's. Thiswas effected by the plaintiff's patent by means of a blast of air wlich was made to pass between the stopes and an exhaust which drew out the air. The llour was thus kept cool; and the "stive," or floating dust, iras collected in a chamaber. Defendants were large millert at at Lincoln, and as the Improvement made the flour wdrth Is. a barrel more they hadfor severalyears paid the plaintiff 1,7001. per annum for a license to use his apparatus. But they had since adopted an apparatus maide by a Mr. Gordon, which the plaintiff said was an. infringemaent of his patent. This was, denied by -the defendantg, w ho bemgindemnifed by Gordon, deden the action, ana gave evidence to show that the asppa ratus used by the defendants was nothine more than an invention of Mr. Gordon, patented in 186, withthe ad. dition of anexhaustapparatus, which they contendedvwasnot at all the subject of a patent, ithaving been in common use at the Tradeston 3Mis ne-ar Glasgw at the end of 184, before the plainti's patent was tawen out. Mr. Muir, the proprietor of the Tradeston Mills, said he had seen the ex-
haus apparatus in operation at Altona, in Denmarkl and had introduced it into his mill, and communicated it to Gordon. It appeared, however, that he had abandoned its use, and that he afterwards negotiated with the plaintiff for a license to use his patent. Anotherdefence was thatthe plaintiffwas not the inventor, but that the invention was discovered by the foreman of Mr. Dives, at Wandsworth, where the plaintiff was at the time engaged in putting up some machinery. The jury, however, after a long trial, and a most careful summing up by the learned Lord Chief Justice, found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 1, 2391. ls. 8d., being at the same rate as the defendants had formerly paid to the plaintiff for his license to use his patent. Subsequently a rule was granted to set aside tha verdict and to enter Lt for the defendants, or to enter a nonsuit, or why there should not be a new trial on the following grounds :-1. That fiing the upper millstone, as mentioned in the plaintiff's specification, was an essential part of the invention, and that the defendants had not used a fixed stone, and had not infringed. 2. That the second part of the invention, as described in the specification, could not be made the subject of a patent, and the specification did not describe the nature or manner of performing any new manufacture. 3. That the verdict was against the evidence with respect to the prior use of the alleged invention; and 4, that the damages were excessive.
Mr. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Bovill, Q.C., Mr. Webster, and Mr. G. Denman, on a previous day, showed cause against the rule, which was this day supported by Mr. Atherton, Q.C., Mr. Hindmiarb, and MIr. Manisty.
Lord CsPB. LL, after conferring with the other judges, said that, with respect to the verdict being against the evidence, he was of opinion that the rule should be discharged. It was clear that M1r. Bovill (the plaintiff) was the inventor of this process, by which the grinding of corn had been most materially improved. An attempt was made to show that be stole at from Dives's man, but that attempt failed and was abandoned. There could be no doubt that the plaintiff was the meritorious discoverer of the process. Still, if it was in previous use, though withouat his knowledge, the patent could not be sustained; and, to show that it was so, reliance was placed on Mr. Muir, the owner of the Tradeston 3MIls, near Glasgow. The evidence on that point was confficting, and it was for thejury to decide which side they would believe. No complaint was made of the manner in which the question was left to the jury, who had decided in the plaintiff's favour. He (Lord Campbell) could not say that they were wrong. On looking at the conduct of Muir and Gordon, his Lordship thought that their evidence was open to the greatest suspicion. In the witness. box Muir stated that the invention was entirely his own, and that the plaintiff's was no improvement on his own; though, after having tried it for a while in his manufactory, be had abandoned it and entered into a negotiation with the
laintiff for a heense to use his patent. With regard to iordon, he saw Muir's invention in 1849, but he refused to enter into any joint speculation to obtain a patent for it. He allowed it to remain dormant till the year 1852, when he published his prospectus, and made the machine for the deo fendants, knowing wellthe peril he would incur, aud indenin fying them from any action which might be brought against them for an infringement of the plaintiffs patent, His Lordship thought that such evidence ought to be regardea with very great suspicion. It was clear that Gordon, till the end of 1852, did not combine the blast with the exhaust, as was done by the plaintiff. The Court must look to see whether in Muir's manufactory the invention had been brought to a perfect improvement by combining the blast with the exhaust. There was no doubt it did combine the two, but not in such a manner as to accomplish the object. His Lordship must say that where there had been an invention and an attempt was made to defeat the patent by a prior use of that whrich had been abandoned the prior use of the invention ought to be made out very satisfactorily.
Mra. Justice WIGJIurNU and lIr. Justice ERLE expressed similar opnoS.
Lord CA=MBELL said thst as to the objections which had been taken in point of law, the Court would take time to consider, and in giving judgment would state whether, after examining the question of damages, there ought to be any substantial reduction.
WVA,TSON V. THE OFFICIAL IANAGER OF TiE ROY iL
BRITISH BA2NK.
In this case a judgment had been obtained by the plaintiff against the official manager of the Royal British Bank, and an order had beon made by a jadge at chambers for execution to issue against one of the shareholders, a Dr. Cullock.
Mr. H. HILL, Q.C., now moved for a rule to set aside the order. The learned counsel stated that the applicant was formerl a customer of the bank, and had a large account there; but that he was induced by the false statements put fortli by the directors to allow a sum of 1,000l. which le had In the bank to be held as against certain new shares which the bank issued. Hewas induced by the fraud of the directors to become a shareholder, but as soon as he discovered the fraud he disaffirmed the contract, and had tendered proof in the Court of Bankruptcy of his claim for
,COO. against the company. The learned counsel contended that, though a shareholder might be liable, Dr. Cullock could not be so after he had thus disaffirmed on the ground of fraud. The question of the liability of shareholders had been raised before all the Courts, but it was understood that judgment would not be given until it was seen whether all the judges were unanimous.
The Court granted a rule to show cause.
THE QUEEN V. THE JUSTICES OF WARWVICKESUIRE
This was a rule calling upon certain justices of Warwickshire to enfore payment of a poor-rate assessed upon the London and North-Western IRailway Company by the parish officers of Kenilworth. When the case was called on,
Mr. W. H. ADAMs said his leader (Mr. Serjeant Hayes) was absent.
3h. BITTLESTON, who appeared for the company, said his leader (Sir F. Kelly) was also absent.
Lord CAIPBELL said that, without any disrespect to the gentlemen who wore silk gowns, he had no doubt the case would be ably and satisfactorily;argued.
Mr. BrrrLESTON proceeded to state that the anan-er to the rule was, that the parish officers already had In their hands money belonging to the company more than sufflcient to pay the demand. The company had appealed against some rates, which were ultimiately reduced, leaving a surplus in the hands of the parish officers. The officers were willing to pay over the surplus, but the auditor told them they could not do so without first obtaining an order of quarter sessions. The learned counsel now contended that such an order was only necessary where tho parties were unwilling to refund; but it was not necessary in this case.
Mr. ADA3is said the parish officers only wished to act accordimg to law.
Lord CA'.MPIELL said the Court was clearly of opinion that an order of sessions was necessary, and no doubt when the auditor was informed of the opinion of the Court he would abide by it. The rule might be enlarged for that purpose. Rule enlarged. BAIL COUPRT.

The trial of this cause was resumed this morning.
Several witnesses for the defendant were examined to show tbat the snm of 1891. charged by the plaintiff for the machine and fixing the same was too high, and some of them stated that th a*geement entered into between the parties was different from that described by the plaintifs witnesses.
The jury retired for some time, and then returned a verdict-rst, that there was no bargain between the parties;

According to the evidence, bales of gainbia coming trom Singapore averaged 2owt. eacb, and were universally in compressed bale3, while the packages delivered were not compressed, and weighed only 601b. or 701b. each.

This was an action of ejectment to recover possession of certain premises in the county of Dtrham, tried before Mr. Baron Bramwell, in which a verdict was entered for the plaintiff, leave being reserved to the defendant to move to enter it for him if the Court should be of opinion that there was no evidence in favour of the plaiutiff to be left to the juy and, a rule mtisi to that effect having been obtained,
Zmtri^L H.LL and Mr. J. ADDISOS novw showed cause against it. It appeared that in 18.3 a lease of the premises in question was granted by the Dean and Chapter of Dorham to a Mr. Sherwood for 21 years, renewable at the end of every 7 years on payment of a fine. This lease was duly renewed in 1S42 to Sherwood; but in the year 1849 the docament had in some way, not exDlained by the evidence, come into the hands of one Wood, who took it to the office of the Dean and Chapter, and they, having first satis6ed themselves that he had eome fairly by it, according to their usual practice, granted the renewal to him, and kept possession of the old lease. lie paid the fine on this occasion, as also did he or his assignee on the subsequent renewal in 1856, Sherwood never interfering to prevent his possession of the land, or to claim any interest under the lease. Davison, the plaintiff, claimed title under Wood, but there was no evidence to show the nature of the defendanut's title or alleged title to the premises. At the trial the plaintiff showed a possession for more than 20 years under the Dean and Chapter, in answer to which the defendant produced the lease of 1842 to Sherwood, and asserted that, as this appeared on the face of it to be a lease for 21 years, and had never been surrendered, it overrode the lease to Wood. It was now urged that there was evidence of Sherwood's assent to the lease to Wood, and that that amounted to a surrender by operation of law of the lease of 1842, and that at all events the plaintiff had a good possessory title as against the defendant, who, for all that appeared, might have been a mere intruder, and had no right to object that the title was in Sherwood.
Mr. MA?iisTY, in support of the rule, contended that there was no evidence of Sherwood's assent to go to the jury, as there was nothing to show by whoi the lease was sent to the Dean and Chapter, or for what purpose ib came into their possession.
The CiFn BAtRON was of op'inon that the rule must be discharged. It was well established that when a lessee assented to a lease beir,g given to another and gave up possession of the premises, and the new lessee was put into posession, that was a surrender by operation of law. Here it appeared that possession was given up, and the parchment document was in the hands of the tenant, by which he was enabled to get a lease. The only question was whether there was such assent on the part of the old lessee and was it not according to the usual course of busi. ness tuat he gave up the lease for that purpose and no other 9 At all events, it was for the defendant to show affirmatively that he had some title, and, in any case, the plaintiff was erltitled to succeed as against him.

ASAIALMS V. ITILSO'M AND ANOT}I1R.
This action was tried before the Chief Baron at the sittings after last term in Middlesex, when the plaintiff was nonsuited, and a motion was now made for a rule to show cause why the nonsuit should not be set aside and a new trial had, on the grounds of the improper rejection of evidence and misdirection.
The declaration was in slander, alleging that the defendant said of the plaintiff that he had been transported and was out on a tacket of leave, by reason whereof Henry Myers refused to deal with the plaintiff in the way of his trade. The words were proved, and evidence was tendered to the effect that the refusal to deal was not by Myers personally, but by his town-traveller, who always transacted his business, and had absolute discretion to deal with and trust whom he pleased. The learned judge rejected the evidence, beingof opinion that the refusal to deal must be the result of the slander operating on the mind of the person so refusing, and that the agent hearing the slander and Myers in consequence refusing to deal were very different things from the agent hearing tre slander and in consequence himself refusing to deal, as it might be that the agent went to Myers and said that he had heard complaints about the plaintiff, to which Myers maght have replied, " I don't wish to hear anything about it; I have confidence in you; do not deal with him unless you like," in which case Myers's refusal would not result from the operation of the slander on his (Myers's) mind.
Mr. Edward Jamnes appeared in support of the rule nisi, and
The COURT took time to consider whether it should be granted, and whether the declaration should at this stage be E llowed to be amended.
GOODMNI. V. GRITIIS.
Mr. CoLLrxR moved for a rule to show cause why the nor suit on this action, which was tried before Mr. Baron litartin in Middlesex at the sittings after last term, should not be set aside aud a new trial had. The action was for the price of goods bargained and sold, and it appeared that the plaintiff was a dealer in paper goods and books, and the plaintiff being about to purchase some a contract in the following form was entered into :-The defendant took into his hand a printed bill containing a list of the goods and their prices, and signed a memorandum referring to, and agreeing to buy, eertain of the wares mentionsd in the printed list, which, as we have said, gave also the prices, and it was agreed by word of mouth that a certain discount should be deducted from those prices. Mr. Baron Martin was of opinion that this was a contract that ought, by the provisions of the Statute of Frauds, to be in writing and signed by the defendant; and, admitting that the printed list referred to in the memorandum might be taken as part of the written contract, thought that it did not comply with those provisions, for it did not specify a material part of the awreement-viz., the price, the price to be charged being, not that mentioned in the list, but that sum less the disCoiin t.
Mir. Baron BRAAiNETLL.-You have this beautiful result from a statute which the merchants in London appear to be so enamoured of that when you have a memorandun in writing which is defective, as not completely setting out the contract, you are obliged to prove the real contract, in order to show that the proof ot such contract cannot be admritted. It was also argued that the defendantby writing fo- and receiving an invoice containing the real prices, and m 'king no objection to them, but repudiating the contract only on other grounds, had made that invoice part of the written agreement.

Mr. LUCAs said he appeared as counselfor2;r.Scammell, a creditor for 3,001., and 40 creditors whose debts altogether amounted to 15,0001. The accounts had onily been filed that morning, and!he asked foran adjournment for sixweeks er two montis to investgate them.
Mr. LAIVRANCE said Tr. Lucas had only anticipated the wish of the assignees, who were equally desirous to have tbe fullest investigation. The accounits extended over a
eriod of 18 months, and occupied 300 sheets of paper. The most important point was to investigate tbe position Of the bankrupt in December, 1854. He then took credit for a surplus of upwards of 14,0001., and executed a post-nuptial settlement on his wife of 6,0001. The bankrupt said be had this surplus of 14,0001. The assignees, on the contrary, denied that he was solvent at that time. The bankrupt had put a value on certain uroperty, and his accountants, feeling the difficulty of their p;osition, had sulggested that the ascsignees should employ a surveyor to value the pro2wrt. They had thus far declined to do so. They said the hank. rupt must first furnish a statement of the value of the property, and be careful how he made the estimate. Having that before them they would decide whatcoursetotake. There was another question which it might be necessary for the assignees to raise. It was believed that the trustees to the sett]ement were trustees for the bankrupt, and not for his wife ; but he would not now go into that. A large portion of the bankrupt's estate had been realized, and the official assignee (Mr. Whitmo'thad now inhand about 11,0001. or 12,0001., which he proposed to divide among the creditors as early as possiblo.
In reply to the Court Mr. Whitmore said, the estate might realize something beyond 15,0001. more than the amount now in hand. 6,0001. of the general assets had been applied in paying off mortgages. The amount in hand would suffice to pay a dividend of about 2s. 6d. in the pound.
Mr. LAiAvR.?CE said the proofs against the estate up to this time amoanted to 90,0001., and it was thought that they would not exceed 100,0001. or 120,0001. The assets would he increased by several sales of property, nearly completed.
Mr. LctAs.-The present dividend will be about 2s. in the pound.
Mr. LAivRiLNCE.-I think we may make it 2s. od. We vwill divide as closely as possible.
The CoamUlssisoxxs said that the bankrupt had pro. duced 30,0001. of assets, and he did not feel called upon to make any alteration of his allowance of 71. per veek, and that there would be an adjournment to Friday, the 13th of February.
Mr. LuCAS wished it to be under,tood that the 40 creditors whom he represented desired to institute a separate investigation of the bankrupt's accounts.
Mr. GALSaVORTHY tendered a claim for 30,0001. as arising in connexion with certain proceedings in Chancery in the suit of " Kay v. Johnson.' The precise amount of the claim could not at the present moment be ascertained.
A Creditor objected to the continuation of the bankrupt's allowvance of 71. pr week. Hie (the creditor) was livnng upon bread and cheese, and there were many creditors who would feel their losses more severely than he did. Some poor creatures felt the loSS of S. or 101. most severely. It was a cruel case.y
The Co.NnassSorcxx said that, unfortunately, there was cruelty in all c-ase of balkruptcy.
A Creditor.-I am obliged to keep my family upon less than 71. per week.
The Cosimissioirxn remarked thatthe alowance was only moderate in a case were 30,0001, of assets were prodaced to meet 100,0001. of debts.
Mr. Luc,is said, some creditors felt that this case had not been treated as an ordinary one.
The Commisssioh-En said that the allowance in the case was smalL Taking into consideration the amount of assets the bankrupt's allowance would not be one-tenth so much as that received by bankrupts in smaller cases. It was an outrage upon Justice to say that persons in the position of the bankrupt were favourably treated.
fr. LUCAS.-That is the feeling of creditors.
The CO35s555I01;ERo -YOu know that it is an unjust
Mr. LA%vR,%CE said, a complaint had been made of the appointment of the present assignees. The fact was Mr. Lucas's client (Mr. Scammell) had voted in their favour. Powera of attorney from Hertford and Ware had also been sent upto the amount of 40,0001. in sapport of that choice. It was true one of the assignees was a creditor for a sum under 1001., but the other assignee, lr, Elsey, of the Bank of England, represented that corporation, and the debt of the bank was 17,0001.
A Creditor.-Is the Bank of England unsecured?
Mr. LtAvRAXcE_.-rerfectly unsecured. They do not hold a fraction of security, except, of course, the names of other parties on the bills.
The Cowuassiogr.s said he bad made a calculation, and he found that the 24. of allowance to the bankru t as objected to would not produce an addition to the dividend of more than one-fourth of a farthing in the pound.
Mr. LUCAS said, a small sum among many might nevertheless be a large sunm for one man.
Mr. George Lovegrove, of HIrtford, said he had proved for 881. There was a further sum of 551. upon which he wanted to take the opinion of the Court. The bank stopped payment and closed its doors at 4 o'clock. Between 2 and 3 o'clock of the same day the sum of 551. was paid into Messrs. Masterman and Co.'s to his credit. The bank at Hertford had not entered the amount in its books, and he submitted that he was entitled to the amount in full. He had not had any opportunity of receiving advice that the money was paid.
The CONDrSrSIONER. disallowed the claim, and the debt was proved as an ordinary one.
After some discussion an audit meeting was fixed for the 12th of February, and a dividend meeting for the fol-
lowing day. I
Mr. Lovegrove said he could bear testimony to the distressed condition of many of the depositors in the bankpoor men who had become depositors on the faith of its
respedtability.
Ahe Coins8iNER.-You cannot go into other people's eases.
Mr. Lovegrove.-They had at first been led by the official assign.eCe to ex%pect a dividend of l0s. in the pound.
Tome COinlsasioNER said that all that onlv went to show that Mr. Whitmore had not made a prudent guess at the position of the bankrupt's estate-that he was not a prophet, and that it might be better to hold his tongue.
Mr. LucAs said, creditors were greatly dissatisfied, and that he was informed the bankrupt was not exerting himself to do the best he could for his estate.
A Creditor.-And you are rightly informed, too.

The Coarmssso?ins. said it was seldom that an estate could be realized at once, but he was sure that a dividend would be declared at the earliest possible moment.
After some discussion on the subject of a claim in connexion with Messrs. Mason and Waller, the executors of the estate of the late Mr. Samuel Adams, and for whom Mr. Armstrong appeared, an adjournment was ordered.
iN RE D). 55ARCLAY.
The bankrupt was a leather-dresser of Bermondsey. This was an adjourned examination meeting.
Mr. ISnklater appeared for the bankrupt, Mr. Roberts for the assignees, and Mr. Roy, htr. Chidley, and Mr. Smith for creditors.
Mr. Roy said he appeared for the London and Westminster e bank rupt, baOupt was one of six firms, all of whom were bankrupt, who had mnade themiselves remarkable in connexion with certain bills of exchange, no such pessoors as the persons purporting to be the drawers of such bills baving had an existence. The bankrupt was the acceptor of some of these bills, and in any case le could not he said to have evinced due care. Thomas Hollanad(tobacco broker) was another of the pairties. AMr. Commissioner Holroyd had ordered an adjournment in order that one De Jongh might be examined and furnish particulars which the bankrupt was unable to supply. Hlolland could not he examined, being ill. If these parties had combined to make the bills, a serious offence had L been committed. There being no real drawer, it was difficult to say who had been the circulator, The firm of Walter Irving and Co.,1of Bordeaux, drew upon Barclay, and discount of the hill wvas afterwards obtained. While the case was so enveloped in mystery it was impossible to allow any one of the parties to pass who might be aware of the forgery.
The Coamkississron.c-Not one of them can be allowed to pass until the matter has been explained. It is the hankrupt's business to answer all questions put to him on the subject. Is lis examination before the Court ?
of bis and passedRthem to a Mr. l boad accepted a number
alleged that the proceeds haadbreendivided between them.
The bankupt said this was not so. He had received a portion of teo money from De Joogh, only in the form of payment for goods which he had consigned to him. He did not to his knowledge, however, receive any money from the The C0olMSSI0osEM s.-You mean you employed De Jorgh discount hills and bring you money. lho is De Jongh ? Is he a Frenchman ?
Mr. LLAe5iTER.-Ho is a Dutchman. The C0i£mxissSoiss. -What is hle?
Mr. RoBEBTs.-He is a general morchant, of 71, Marklane.
The Co Iu0silost.-A general mercbant I I supposehe buys and sells everything he can lay his hands on.
Mr. Roy explained that the bankrupt's statement was, that he accepted the bills and allowed his name to be used as a means of getting money for his goods, When before Mr. Commissioner Holroyd that learned commissioner had remarked upon his having kept a bill-book, but in which all mention of these bills was omitted. The bankrupt said he had accepted many bills drawn by Walter Irving and Co., of Bordeaux, but he could not state the number or amount.
The COaiaisolrsB.it- And he says he accepted them at the reqnest of De Jongh.
The bankrupt (examined) said that, having sold two or three parcels of leather to De Jongh and received money for the same, he had remarked to De Jongh that he (bankrupt) had once done a little business in America. Da Jongh then said he could raise means to do a large trade there. He was not himself anxious to go into it; it was, however, agreed that it should be done. He than gave bills and got aoknow. ledgnents from De Jongh that lie would see them paid. Some of those aoknowledgmeats had been handed vo the
efficial assignee. He had accepted bills to the amount of 6,0001. in circulation. De Jough had undertaken to tako
care of thena but he had lost'som'e ofthesee undertakings.! Till lately, tise bills had been'uregularly takent up; i 2 :
Mr.- RoY called the attention of the -Court to-theeircumstance that the biUs had every apneazanco of being genuine bills from Walter ring and Co., of Bordeaux. Tlerz was no doubt, however, that they had been concocted in London.
The CoMMsoxNR.-Did the London and Westminster Bank discount them without knowing anything of Irving and Co. ?
Mr. RoY said, it was impossible for the bank to ascertain that. De Jongh brought the bills and the bank discounted them for him.
The CO35MiSSIO'.ER.-What has become ff De Jongh?
Mr. RoY.-He is a bankrupt also. He sought to effect a pivate arrangement, but upon ;Mr. Commissioner Holroyd
eing informed of these bill transactions he sent the case to bankruptcy. In addition to the fictitious names of Walter Irving and Co., there were used those of Beckhart and Co. The bankrupt (Barclay) said he did not know either the drawer or the payee of these bills.
Mr. I5NRLTER said, De Jongh was now present, and might be examined.
l'he CO53MiSSiNER thought all the parties to the bills ought to be examined at the sarme time. He did not think that one of them could be allowed to pass until the matter had been fully explained. If parties would enter into transaetions of this kind they must take the consequences.
Mr. LINKLATER.-The bankrupt is deeply interested in having this investigation.
Mr. RoY observed that the singular part of the case was, that not any one of the six firms cord' state what had become of the proceeds of the 10,0001. of bills discounted. Holland was stated to have had a good deal to do with the matter, but he was ill-perhaps conveniently ill-in bed. On two or three occasions he bad failed to attend to pass his examination ; medical certificates were given of illness. The certificates set forth that Holland was perfectly clear in his mind, but could not move his feet.
Mr. LINSaLTER.-We only want his mind and his body. The CoxIssSiO2ER.-The circumstances require full in^ vesgation. lf the mountain won't come to Ifahomet Mahomet must go to the mountain. Mr. Whitehead wili
take Holland's examination at his own lodgings at Hampstead. There will be an adjournment to Friday, the 27th of March and if the bankrupt should not duly perform his part in the investigation be may be perhaps be. adjourned sine die, and without protection.
A letter was here handed to the Commissioner.
Hlis HoNoun remarked that it was addressed to Barclay and Co., when, in fact, there was no company at all. Where was De Jon&h?
Mr. LINiATE-He is here.
(De Jongh presented himself, but was not examined.)
nmr. ROBERTS said, he thought the assignees had got all the information they could, although the case, no doubt, was very unsatisfactory.
Hlis HaOoun thought that the more eagerly Mr. Roy and others prosecuted the inquiry the better it would be for the public.
An adjournment was then ordered..
Police.
P6ic.idE
MAioSIoN-nousE.-Edward Horaeo Monteflore, described as a civil engineer, was again brought before the LORD MAYOR, chargec with having uttered a forged bill of exchange for 5%,, with intent to defraud the Cape of Good Hope Bank, Cape Towin; also with having obtained the suna of 7941. from the said bank by moans of a forged letter of credit, purporting to be from the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury; and also with obtaining 911. from Messrs. Hamilton and Ross, merchants, Cape Town, by means of a forged letter, purporting to ba from Messrs. Guthrie and Chalmers, merchants, London.
Evidence in support of these general charges had been gone into very fully on previous occasions, aned on Saturday last the prisoner was remanded, in order to give the Lora Mayor time for consideration upon points which had been raised by Mr. Lewis, for the defence, questioning the jurisdiction of the Court.
Upon the prisoner being now placed at the bar,
The LORD MAAYoR said, he had given very full attention to the case since the prisoner was last before him, and, from the facts adduced, had come to the conclusion that he had no jurisdiction, and that therefore the prisoner must be discharged.
Mr. Roy, solicitor to the London and Westminster Bank, said he wished before the prisoner was discharged to thank the Lord Mayor, in the name of that establishment, as well as on behah of Messrs. Barin,g and Co., and 'essrs. Chalmers and Co., for the patient attention he had given to the case, and also to state that the London and Westminster Bank had instituted the prosecution solely upon public grounds. Neither that bank nor either of the firms to which he had referred had lost a shilling by the prisoner, but, as he hadmade use of their names m carrying oat his transactions, they had thought it due to public justice to proceed as they bad done.
The prisoner then quitted the bar, and was accompanied from the court by Scott, the detective, who had him in charge, through the clerkse room. He took the officer's arm as soon as they were clear of the outer door, and went chatting and laughing down the steps leading to the street, when, tohissurprise,hewastapped on the shoulder by a sheriff's ofiicer, who arrested hun for a debt of 2501. at the suit of a. gentleman in theIisle of Wigt, of whom he had bought a vessel for 800l., for which he paid 501. in cash, and gavehisaccetancfor the balance, payable at the Bank of England, where ho had no account.
G1urrrDnLL.-George Martin, a man in the employ of Mr. William Clark printer, of Union-street, Bhlckfiars, was charged with stealig a quantity of type, the property of his master.
Mr. Taylor said he was manager to Mr. Clark, in whose employ the prisoner had been about four mouths. In conseqaence of having missed some type, witness suspected the prisoner and watched him accordingly, when, as he was leaving his work, witness stopped him and inquired if he had any objection to be searched, upon hearing which the prisoner almost fainted, and then took off his coat, in the pockets of which several pieces of metal. stereotype blocks, and type, belonging to MI. Clark, were found. The weight of the mietal so discovered was about 121b. The prisoner begged to be forgiven; but, asMr. Clark hbad been robbed of sinilar property to the amount of about 1001., he felt it his duty to give the prisoner into custody.
Sir R. W. CABDxNN said, this was one of those cases in which the injury done to the master was considerably greater than any pecuniary benefit the prisoner could obtain by lundering his employer, as the property stolen was of little valuenwhen sold as old metal compared with the value of it to M. Clark. He should send the case for a jury to deal with.
The prisoner was then committed for trial.
John Jones, a lad 17 years of age, was brouglht up} chargeld with having a quantity of type in his possession, supposed to be stolen.
Police-constable Hubble, 149, said he saw the prisoner offering the type for sale, and took him into custody.
The prisoner refused his address, and on being sked in whose employ he had been he declined to give his master's namne.
Sir I. W. CARDEN said, if the prisoner would not say for whom he had worked, it would be necessary to find his master for him. He therefore remanded the prisoner till Saturday.
Bov-STsREET--51. from " G. E. ;" 5s. from "1A. G. HEL
and 2s. 6d. from "F. W. B.," have been received for the poor-box.
AL&RUBOROUGH-SThRET.-Mr. Jeffries, churchwarden of St. Anne's, Soho, applied to Mr. BriNCAsat on behalf of the respectable portion of the inhabitants of Leicester-square for a warrant under the 25th of George I., which would empower the police to enter the Caf6 Chantant, in Leicestersquare, aid take into custody all persons found in the place, the W Ca h antant being without a music or dancin licne The caf6, which had been opened by an Italian, had been refused a license by the magistrates, but the proprietor persisted in evading the law, and the caf6 had bcome a complete nuisance to the neighbourhood, not only on account of the loose characters who congre^ated there, but on account of the late hours at which they dispersed. The residents having received information that a baU was to be given at the caf6 to-morrow evening (Friday), and that some subterfuge vwa to be resorted to in order to defeat the law, they had requested hirm to apply to the magistrates of that court to issue a warrant and to Arrest some of the company, as that would have a powerful effect in suppressing this kind of nuisance for the future.
Mr. BrNuaHm was 'ute aware, from previous appliea. tions to bin, that the &is6 Chantant wasPwithout a,music hicense, and yet continued open nightly. He thought the case would be best met by dealing with it under thePolice Act.
Mr. Jeffries said, the vestry-clerk had been consulted on thae matter, and bad, on looking into bothx acts, decided that the act 25th of George II. was the most summary of the two,
Mr. BnrGuAx.-And the most harsh; but, as I think the Police Act is of more recent date, and more applicable to modern morals and mananers, I shoald recommend you to try the effect of that act on the proprietor of the caf6.
Mr. Jeffries thanked the magitrte and left the court.
For the poor-box 5s. (stamps) have been received ; on the 8th inst. the balf of a 51.-note, No. 80,669, was received from ".R. E.," but the second half has not been sent.
WFssasuismS.-The lengtbened investigation of the charges against Samuel Taylor, an omnibus conductor, who is accused of embezzling large sunms of money, was yesterd*y brought to a close.
The msagistrate directed the witnesses to be bound over to prosecute at the Central Crinmnal Court instead of the sessions, and the accused put in bail to appear.
WORs.STRsEET.-Martba ,Ratcliffe, 38, was charged before Mr. .&mA mLL with being, as it was entered upon the N division charge-sheet, found in a destitute condition at the doors of St. Luke's workhouse. The defendant is a tall woman, who has apparently, from her languae and demeanour, seen what is commonly termed "better ays."
Pohceman Luff, 62 X-I went on duty at 11 o'clock la .t night in the City-road, and directly after, saw this woman huddled up on toe pavement in front of the gate of St.
Luke's workhouse. She said she had been refused admis- I sion, and I therefore knocked, and a pauper, who is a sort of assistant-porter, opened the wicket. Isaid, "Here isa poor woman who has been lying here ever since half-past 7 o'clock, as she teDs me" (she had told me so), " and sbe says you will not take her in." He replied that he should not, and slammed the door in -^y face. Aftr that I saw Alattocks or Maddocks, the acknowledged porter, and he told me he had distinct orders from the 'coard not to admit the woman, as she had left the house of her own accord about four months ago. I told him I would wait till near 12 o'clock, and that if she were not then taken in I would convey her to the police-station. At a quarter to 12, however, ifound it was so sharp and severe a night that I then took her to Robert-street station, for I could no longer bear to see a fellow-creature in such a condition.
Woman.-I did leave the house, Sir, at the time stated, but it was because I wes so much overworked. Since then I have picked up rags and rubbish, and sapported myself as wrell as I could in that way. If I had been at that gate much longer last night I certainly should have died.
Mr. Hs..IMII.-I can scarcely believe that any such order
should have been given to the porter by the board. Do you, Hayward, as you are the warrant office; of that district; let It-be understood&thst I wish to hear how it was that-thisworn,an wa refuaed,vor why it was that an excep-tion was madeain_her_case.
Sergeant- leatb, 2 N.-It is X pitiable sight, Sir, to see the iDany pbor crditures who lie at the gates of this workhouse, and when the police knock they are treated very roughly, and told to mind their oarn business. They have frequently been obliged to remove the destitute from there to Shoredtch workhouse.
Sergeant Harvey, G division.-I assure your worship it is quite shocking. There we frequently numbers of both sexes, and aU aties, crouching dowvn at the doors, and who'll unnoticed by the authorities of St. Iuke's workhouse. I resida in that parish myself, and pay poor-rates, and I am 6ften astonished at -what I see at their gates.
Mr. HAnXHLL-I have had occasion twice to communicate with the Poor Law Commissioners with respect to Whitechapel workhouse, and am happy to say that I have mot since heard any complaints of their conduct to the destitute. One of the officials should attend from St. Luke's, for it is not onl this case of the womana found last night and refo8ed isaion, but complaints are made bythe police of a nature which require attention.
In the course of the afternoon one of the parish officers, named Newman, brought up three young men, casunl paupers, for destroying their clothing, and at the termina. tion of that case Mr. HmdaSThI, addressing Newmaan, said, "You are not the porter Ibeleve?'
New, man.-No, Sir, Iam not; that is Mattocks, and he will be here presently.
Mt HA3MTILI-So I expect.
Susbsequently Hayward returned and said that the master would attend on Saturday, which would be after the Board
The two sergeants, and anotherofficer wvo had alsospokon to the beneh of the great neglect shown to the destitute poor at that workhouse, waited a ut the court for a long timne h after the disosal of the case, to have an opportuniw of con fronting any persons who might attend from the workhouse, but the busiess of the court closed without the porter or any one else making any statement.
Cit pe tht-Dr. O'Connor, of feontalu-street, iMontagucasquare, one of the physicians of the Royal Free Hosptal, oray's-ti-road, who was summoned last week b,v Willlam Clarke, a cabman, badge 390, for refusing to pay
im s legal fare, but whose case was remaned for the purpose of having the ground measured again, attended before Mr. TYdwin t to hear his decision.
This case has excited considerable interest, and this was the third tie that it has been before the Court.
t appears that Dr. O'Connor has frequently ridden in a cab from the stand at the corner of Francis-street, Tottenhams-coart-road, to the Royal Free Huospital, for twhich he has paid a fare of 6d. Some weeks bcok cabman Wiliam C,arke, 390, obtained two summonses agaiust him for two fares of 6d. each, which, en being heard before Mr. Tyrwhitt, were decided according to the ofDidcal book of cab fares, which states the distancce to be 420 yards more than a mile, and Dr. O'Connor was oblged to pay 8s., rncluding the costs of the two summonsesf the cabean's loss of time, and the two sums demanded. In a few days after Dr. O Conuor
peared at this couart before Mr. Tyrwhitt, when he stated tdat, havng some doubts of the correctness of the hook, he walked the distance in 1,5o2nsteps, ad subsequentl had the ground measured by a competent person on two several occasions, when it was found to be only 1,o89 yards, that is lSO less than a mile, and he therefore thought the case a fit one for re-investigation. This the magistrate declined doing, and Dr. O'Connor continued to ride the same distance giving only 6d. for the fare, with the view of again bringin2 the matter under the notice of the magistrate for farther investigation. Last Monday week Dr. O'Connor got into the cab, the driver of which had previously summoned him to this court, aud, on refusing to pay more than 6d., another surmons was issued against him, which came on for hearing on Wednesday week, on which day it was arranged that the ground should be measured by the officer of the court, and it was accordingly adjourned for further hearing, whon the magistrate decided, after the offlcer of the court had stated that he had measured the ground, and found it to be 390 yards short of a mile. that the book was wrong, and therefore his judgment mast be in favour of Dr. O'Connor and against the cabman.
The cabman objected tothe decision, as being in opposition to the act, which stated that the official book of the commssioners was to be considered conclusive in all cases of disputed fares.
Mr. TYRwEITT said that view was perfectly correct urtil thebook was found to be wrong. In thss case, owing to some accident, he supposed, the bookwas found to be wrong, and he could not aecide in favour of what was wrong against a fact. His judgment, therefore, must be in favour of Dr. O'Connor until corrected by a superior trilunal or
Dr. O'Connor contended that the act must be interpreted in its popular meaning and intention, which was to establish a correct authority in disputed points between cabmen and the pubic. It could not o supposed that the Legislature ever intended the act to give support to that which whether by accident or carelessness, was grossly incorrecti He bad gone to some expense and loss of time in this matter, for the purpose of getting it corrected by the proper anthorities, and he was glad he had so far succecded.
The cabman applied or his expenses and the cost of the present summons, which the Magistrate declined to grant.
Dr. O'Connor, in reply to a question, declined to pressfor his expenses against the cabman, although he considered the cabman deserved some punishment, for he admitted he was aware the distance was under a mile, and that he was taking advantage of the error in the commissioners? book of fares, which he supposed, right or wrong, was conclusive athority in his favour.
Air. TYBw}I, under these circumstances, advised the cabman notto say any more onthe matter, lestit shouldturn out that -he would be the sufferer. He hoped this error in the book of fares would be represented to the Commissioners of Police, with a view to its correction.
The parties then left the court.
The sitting Magistrate requested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of 51. from "A.P.," of Boulogne, which was forwarded to this court by "T. G."
SouTHswAri.-Richard Burke, a well-dressed, powerfullooking fellow, who has been transported and liberated with a ticket of leave, was brought before Mr. BuncuA.si for final examination, chaTged with attempting to break into the dwelling-house of Mr. Williau Alloway,No. 16, UnionEquare, Horsemonger-lane.
iMr. Solomaon appeared for the accused.
Mrs. Alloway stated that on Saturday evening, shortly after 5 o'clock, she left her house securely fastened up to proceed to her husband's place of business. On her return home she found that some man was taken into custody for attempting to break into the house. She accordingly examined the lock and perceived that great force had been used to get the bolt back, and that the box had been nearly broken from the screws which held it to the sidepost. The thieves must have watched her out, as, according to informatiox she received, they commenced their operations as Eoon as she left. Witness informed his worship that in August last the thieves watched her from home, and, having entered the house, plundered it of every portable article of value; even the eheets and blankets were tak-en from the beds.
Alfred Duncombe, a very intelligent lad, residing with hs parents at No. 20, Union-square, said that shortly before 6 o'clock on Saturday evening he saw the prisoner, two other men, and a woman standing at the door of No. 16. Re distinctly saw the prisoner near the door, and he believed that he was enreavouring to open it with something
e held in his hand. A constable then entered the square, and as soon as he made his appearance another man near the cornernmake a signal, and they all ran off except'the prisoner, who was captured.
Philip Raymond, police-sergeant 22 M, said that on account o numerous robberies having been committed in the neighbourhood of Union-square extra constables were put on duty to detect the depredators, On Saturday evening he wa passimg through, when he saw two men and a woman at the door o No. 16, and another man at the corner, who immediately on his approach made a signal, and the others ran off. Witness, however, captured the prisoner and took him into custody.
Mr. BuRmc e asked what was known of the prisoner.
Sergeant Raymond replied that he was tried at the Westminster Sessions, and transported for seven years for pickitng e. About two years ago he was liberated with a
Mr. Solomon contended that that had nothing to do with the charge before his Worship. His client was not charged with felony, but with vagrancy.
Mr. BuRcaAm said he should not deal with the prisoner under the Vagrant Act, but he should send him to the sessions for attemptingto break into a dwelling-house.
Mtr. Solomon said there was no proof of that either from the testimony of the lad or the police-sergeant. The lad said he saw the men go toward the door and do something, but he did not swear what was done and by whom. Under those circumstances he asked the magistrate to discharge the prisoner.
Mr. BURCiI.A? remarked he should do nothing of the kind. Here was a man who had been transported prowling about the streets in a very suspicious manner with others, and he had no doubt an attempt was made to break into the dwellng-house in question. He should fully commit him to the Eessions for trial.

Meeting Of Middlesex Magistrates.
MRETIrW OF MIDDLESgx MAGisr1A.T_ZT&
A meeting of the m3gistracy of Middlesex Was helyesterday at Clerkenwell, to transact the ordinary business of the-county- 3fr.-PownaUrchafrmen f-thebeb p,e ded and there were about 60,agistraWfpreseit.
THE COPITY. FIISANCES.
The report of the Comunittee 'foi'Accounts and General Purpoies was brought -up and reatdbyMEr. MAUDE, the deputy-clerk of the peace and on the motion of 3r. KaEws. IDEAD, the chairmii of the committee, an order was made n,on the county treasurer for the pa met of bills,
ies, and demands to the Amount. Of 1 8134 lOd. It appeared from a carefully prepared Analysis of the accounts that the expenditure of the county for the year 1856 was 110,65WI. M2. 9d., which was equivalent to 34d. 'n thuepound upon the entire assessment of the county. The
ito t expen htre showed a reduction, as oompa&Rd with. that of 1855, of 5,467L 3s. 1d. The debt of the coupty, for wbich the rates were mortgaged, was 385,5901, witfi,tontine annuities amonnting to 2,4881., which might be expected to fall in within a short tine, as the latest was granted as farback as 1795.,
An ordinary county-rato of dd. in the pound, and a rate of id. under the LunaticAsTlums Acts, were ordered.
THE COUNTY LUNATiC AsyLUMs.
Voluminous reports were brought up from the visiting justices of the asylums at Hanwea and Colney-hatch. The Court ordered them to be printed and taken into consideration on at future day. The number of patients at HaLnwell was 1,023, and at Colney-hatch 1,294. The Court agreed to the following resolution upon the Hanwell report, which was nuoved by SirAlexander Spearman: -
"That this b ioprt h% ing learnt with stfindMt te en't

posd alteration ofl Coney-=ac Aslum. A letter from
iilDaukes, the aprchitect of the latter asylum, to the chair mae Was read, and ordered to be referred t the committeef
THE T5U5O1S.
The usual reports from the three prisons of the county were Presented. In Coldbathfields House of Correcon there were 1,560 prisoner which excessive number randered it necessary for the tailors aLnd shoemnakers shops to be used as dormitories at night. It was referred back to the committee to oppose the bill about to be introduced into P'arliament by the Metropolitan Railway Company, as it contained clause whichl the committee thought would virtualy defeat what was done in 1854 to protect the interest of the county with respect to the prison at Coldhathfields, The report called the attention of the Court to the cae of two prisoners who were sent froft a police-t.onrt for an offence in,St. Margaret's workhouse, who were al but in a state of nudity, the only article of covering they had being a piece of coarse wrapper canvass. In the House of Correction at Westminster there were 8min0pso d in the House of Detention 205-giving a gPe_nertotalof

La Plata experienced strxg westerly gales on the home. 'ward voyage, ancd on the niorning of the 12th inst. a fearful hurricane from W.N.W. and N.w., during whicl .tbe vessel had to round te for 12 hours. During the latter part of the voyoge the wind was northerly, with fine -weather.
On the outward voyage, at noon on Friday, the 5th of December, during a fresh gale, a sea struck the ship forward -and washed two men overboard--George Brinsby and William Watts. Mr. Mfay, supernumerary fifth officer, having put on a life buoy, leaped overboard with another to one of the men. A fearful sea was ranning at the time, but he succeeded in placing the life buoy over Brinsby. The star. board cutter (.nanned by the chief officer, fourth officer, carpenter, boatswain, and three men who volunteered) was lowered, and succeeded in picking up Mr. May and George :8rinsby, but Watts was not to be seen.
Messrs. Jdgeph and Archibald Tregoning, two gentlemen from Cornwall connected with mining in Central Armerica, have returned in this steamer from that country. Daring their stay thero they visited the celebrated ruined city of Copan, described by Stephens in his Ti-aels in. Ccntual Ames-i en. They have collected from these ruins various specimens of sculptare, which they bring with them.
Jamaica advices are to the 26th ult, but they contain nothing of interest. The House of Assembly continued in session, anid the financial statement for the year, presented by Mr. Hosack, was considered very satisfactory.
From De Cordora's Mrocaetilc Intteni cncer we learn that sales of pimento had been made at 2-id., but little was offer. ing. For coffee 40s. was being paid. Sugars sold at 21s. to 23Ss, according to quality. Irish butter, in small parcels, 'old at 14Ld, and American was dull of sale at lid. In corn a sale of Savanilla had taken place at 3s., and American was held at 7s. Gd. The market was quite bare of hams; sales had been made at 10 J d. for A-merican, and Is. 3d. to is. 4d, for York. Exchanges on London were quoted, for Jamaica and colonial banks, 90 days, 2 per cent. premium ; 60 days, 1 per cent. premium; 30 days, 1i per cent. premium. Private bills at par. Merchants' bills on New York, II per cent. premium.
From Demerara we have papers to the 25th nit., but nothing of public importance had occu rred in the colony since the last maiL The registration ordinance was in operation, and no difficulty had been experienced in carrying out its provisions. Mr. T. II. Forster had been appointed registrar of the counties of Demerara and Essequibo, in the room of MIr. Schrack, who had resigned and returned to Europe. Mr. J. W. Goodman had been appointed a sti pendiary magistrate, in the room of Mr. Lyons, retired on a pension. Heavy rains had fallen throughout the colony during the fortnight before the mail left, and the wet weather interfered considerably with the manufacturing opera. tions on many of the estates. The weather, however, was favourable for the growing canes, and vegetation exhibited everywhere a most luxuriant appearance. The exports from the colony during the fortnight had been :-Sugar, I,0G4 hogsheads, 17 tierces, 692 barrels, 200 bags; rum, 098 puncheons, 73 hogsheads, 122 barrels; molasses, 167 pun. cheons, 33 barrels ; timber, 38,023 feet; shingles, 38,000; plantains, 1,000 bunches ; rice, 600 bags ; coffee, 1 bag; soap, 30 boxes. Of these 399 hogsheads, 17 tierces, and 562 barrels of suger, and 167 puncheons, 33 barrels of molasses were for the2iorth American market. A considerable and increasing trade in sugar and molasses had sprung up betweenthis colony and North Anierica during the last 12 months. Business among the merchants was brisk. Freights for sugar, 2s. to 2s. 3d. ; rum, 3d.
At St. Lucia the crop was late, but would be an average one in quantity.
There is no political news from Barbadoes. In the sugarmarket transactions had taken place at 48s. 6d. to 52s. 6d. for common to fine yellow.
At Trinidad the weather had till within the last week been exceedingly wet. The canes grew, and made up in some measure for their previous shortness, but operations for the comipencement of crop were performed with difficulty. Ships had comne in very freely well loaded with goods, and business of all kinds seemed brisk and encouraging. There was a demand for cocoa, which had realized lately as much as $13, and portions of next year's crop of sugar had been said to be purchased at $5.
A letter from St. Vincent, dated December 22, says there was not nmuch news. The Bishop of Barbadoes had confirmed 300 young people there.
At St. Ritt'a his ERonour A. P. Burt had been appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor to the vacantiudgeship, and his Honour F. S. Wigley to fill the office of Attorney-General, vacant by Mr. Burt's promotion.

By the Vest India steamer La Plata, arrived to-day, we have received Panama papers to the 24th of December, being five days later than those brought by the American steamer Canada.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company's steamer Bolivia, Captain Johnson, arrived from the South Coast on the 21st, with the usual send-monthly mails and ;250,000 in specie. She brought dates from Valoaraiso of Nov. 30; Callao, Dec. 11; and Payta, Dec. 16.
The general news from the Republic of Cllli was not of any particular interest. The President of the Republic was about to visit Valparaiso, where he intended to remain during the warm season. The Valparaiso and Santiago Railroad wvas soon to be opened as far as Limache, a distance of :30 miles. An electric telegraph betwveen Santiago and Talem would probably be co.nplcted this summer. The barks COesar, Helene, and Grasbook had arrived at the port of Montt with 300 German immi grants for the now settlement of Llanquehue. Lighthouses were to be constructed where required along the coast by order of the Government. The first was to be at Valparaiso.
The markets at Chili continued dull, no sales having taken place for e:p-wtatiuu, the local dealers being in general well supplied. All articles of merchandise were abundant except sugar and coffeo, of which stocks were either sma'l or held byimporwcrs. Sales of flour had been limited. In Valparaiso prices ranged from tIt 50c. to $11 for 2001b., bix months. Wheat was scarce, and there was some prospect of the new crop being affected by the rust.
The yellow fever rages in the towns and villages north of La Paz.

The departments of Aloqueguaand Punoremain faithful to the Government; those of Canas and Canches have declared for Vivanco. The Tacna division of the armiy was at Arica to protect that port, and (<eneral San Roman was at Puno, organizing the troops. The city of Cuzco remained faithful to the Government. Truxillo and Lambayeque have declared against the Governmnent, in favour of General Vivanco. In the latter town the people defeated a fe,rce of 40 infantry and a niceet of cavalry.

*A tenant on thr' Dowvshire estate died in 1852. His farm consisted of 2G acres held on lease, but with his death the lease expired, as bis was the last life in it. Hehadmade anwill, by whichleleft the farmto hisson, and bequeathed legacies of 2501. chargeable on his chattel property, but, in ease that property sheuld prove insufficient, he made the legacies a charge en the farn. He named three executers, but they renounced; whcreupon his son took out adniinistration with the wall annexed. He then applied at the Agency-office to be acknowledged tenant of the farm, but had to pay an advanced rent of 321. a-year for the 20 acresin fact, the improvements alleged to be made by the father were valued by the office in the advanced rent to the son. The chattel property proving insufficient to pay the legacies the son refused to pay them out of the farm, alleging that he did not hold it under his father's will, as the lease having expired with his father's life he couid not will the farm, much less charge it with legacies; that at any rate he held the farm, not under his father's will, but direct from thel 'office,' and that at an advance on the former rent. The legatees insisted that the son should pay a sum equal to what the farm would have produced in the market had the tenant-right been put up for sale by comnPetition. It was true he held at an advanced rent direct from the office, stil the right of occupancy was worth something, and whatever sum it was marketable value for they insisted on having in payment of the legacies. The result was, as the parties could not agree, a cause petition was filed in Chancery. The case was sent on refereace into Blaster Brooke's office, and he directed three issues, which came on for trial on Monday lasa, viz. .-
'1 "1. Whether any preference was given to the son by Lord Downshiro, in consequence of the land being charged with legacies, or in consequence of his beinig administrator of his father ?
" ' 2. WVhether the same preference, if any, would have been given in case there had been competition for the lands?
'1 1 3. Was the son's interest, or the tenant-right of the farm, when he obtained possession of it at the increasedrent of 321. a-year, of any, or what marketable vallse, had it then been set up for sale by competition wilh the leave of the 'Office?'
" Such in effect were the three issues directed by the Mfaster, and one does not welU know what to ad,nire most,the ingenuity with which they are framed, so as to pazzle a jury and protract litigatiosi, or the insinuating dexterity with which it is sought to give to ' airy nothing a local habitation and a name.' The evidence went to prove, beyond all doubt, the existence of the tenant-right custom on the Downshire estate, but the jury ultimately admitted their inability to give a verdict on the fii-t and second issues, but on the third they found that the son had an interest in the farm, even at the advanced rent of 321. for the 20 acres, and they valued that interest, or, in other words, valued the right of occupancy, at 3251. Of course, on this finding, the case goes back to the Master's office, out of which we wpsh the parties litigant a good deliverance. This is, we believe, the first instance in which issues have been directed by Chancery founded on the tenant-right custom. Variously and conllictimgly as that custom operates throughlout Ulster, differing essentially as it doss even on estates adjoining one another, being the very reverse of unifor.n in its principle or consistent in its action, the case now before us presents about as remarkable features as any the custom has ever yet

News in Brief
THE TYRE STEAMSHIP,
SOUTHAMPTON, THURSDALY.
Little or no intelligence has been received to-day respecting this ill-fated ship. One or two tugs and lighters have arrived in the Docks, bringing the cochineal (some of which is in a eamaged state), bedding, and part of the cargo. It is hoped that all the cargo, &c., will be saved, even if the vessel should not be got off. She rei ains in the same position, and the weather to-day (south-west wind and rain) is very unfavourable. Pumps and other apparatus have been sent down, and every means possible is being used to get her afloat. Opinions are, of course, divided as to the result, but those which preponderate are contrary to the vessel's recovery.
Destruction Of Old Rochester-Bridge By The Royal Engineers.
DESTB UCTIO fV OF OLD ROCHESTER-BRIDGE BY TIE REO YAL ENGINEERS.
ROCHESTER, JAN. 15.
The experiments which are being performed in this city by the corps of Royal Sappers and Aliners for the destruction of old Rochester-bridge were continued this afternoon, on which occasion a still larger portion of the ancient structure than that destroyed on Tuesday last was blown to pieces by successive blasts of gunpowder, in the presence of General Sir Charleq W. Pasley, K. C.B., General Sir Harry D. Jones, K.C. B., General T. Blanshard, C. B., GeneralP Yule, Royal Engineers, and a large number of officers.
Since Tuesday a careful inspection of the large pier destroyed on that day by the troops of the Royal Engineers has been made by Colonel H. Sandham, director of the Royal Engineers' establishment at Ohatham, and a number of other Engineer offdcers, who have ascertained the results of the experimrent to be very satisfactory, and tho object for v,hich they were undertaken fully realised, the large mass of masonry composing the pier, which was 45 feet long, 21 feet in depth, and 13 feet in width, having been shivered in pieces, and the huge blocks of stone loosened from theirposition, and renderedapable of being easily removed. This pier was built on piles, which were driven into the bed of the river, and so far as the state of the tide has permitted an examination to be made it is evident tbat the force of the gunpowder has had as great an effcot in loosening the foundations as it has had upon the superstructure. The quantity of gunpowder used on Tuesday afternoon was 3001b. weight, divided into six charges, and somse surprise was expressed by the scientific persons present that such a comparatively small qaautity only should have been used in the destruction of such a large portion of the structure; but the object of the engigiLeers was not so much the blowing up and scattering the materials of which the pier was composed as it was to shake the fabric to its foundation, and loosen the pier so that the materials might be readily detached without filling up the bed of the river-a result which was moat successfully accomplished.
The portion of the bridge destroyed by the troops this afternoon was very large, and consisted of the pier and abutment oni which the large arch on the Strood side rested, and was calculated to contain several thousand tons of inasonry. The weight of powder used in the explosions was nearly 1,0001h., and was divided into the same nunber of charges as in the previoas experiments. Sinice November last the Sappers and Miners have been engaged in sinking two sbalts in this portion of the bridge, which were excavated to the respective depths of 24 and 21 feet; one shaft having been sunk in the pier, and the other in the abutment, this portion of the undertaking having been conducted from the commencement by Captain H. Schaw, Royal Engineers. At the base of each shaft sprang two gaieries, each I feet in length, and in these were deposited the charges of gunpowder used in the destruction of the works. Ihe powder was contained in tin waterproof cases, which were enclosed in wooden boxes, 5001b. weight being required for blowing up the pier and arch, and 3001b. weight in destroying the abutment. They keystones of the arch were removed by means of smaUer blasts. The Royal Engineer troops were engaged last night and this morning, under the command of Captain Schaw, in making the requisite preparations for the explosions, and at an early hlour this morning the four charges of gunpowder were deposited ian the galleries, when the operation of "tamping" was proceeded with, and the whole ofthe approaches to the galleries carefully stopped up. The voltaic batterv was worked as before by Captain E. C. Cumberland, Royal Engineers.
In order to prevent accidents Colonel Sandham issued the following notice:-
"On Thursday, the 15th inst., after the blasts in the keyatones of the arch shaU have been fired, the two charges in the pier, each of 2.501b., will be exploded, and then, after a short interval of time, the two in the abutments, each of l1Olh. Captain H. Schaw, Royal Engineers, who has conducted the whole of the mining operations, and Captain C. E. Cumberland, who has made the arrangements for firing by the voltaic battery, will fire each set of mines at the sound of the bagle ' to fire,' after the sound of 'the preparative' has been given as a warning. The wires will be led from the charges to the voltaic battery, which will be placed in the office of Mr. WYright, the engineer of the bridge."
As soon as the arrangements had been completed Colonel Sandham ordered the bugle to be sounded, as a warning to those present to remove from the places of danger, and immediately afterwards the bugler sounded "to fire." The charges in the arch were first exploded, followed by those in the pier. The effect was very striking, the ground for some distance reverberating as if from the effects of an earthquake, while the pier crumbled in pieces and disappeared. T'.e charges in the galleries on the pier abutment were s' terwards fired, and that portion of the bridse destroyed. The large arch of the bridge was blown into the riYer, and the abutment on the Strood side entirely removed, the sight of the massive stonework of the arch being blown high into the air being very grand. Nearly one-half of the bridge has now been destroyed, and the remaining portion will be demolished as speedily as possible.
The whole un&lertaking was considered perfectly satisfactory by Colonel-Sandham and the general and other officers present, and reflected much credit on Captains Schaw and Cumberiland, under whose arrangements the explosions took place.
Notwithstanding a very heavv rain an immense numnber of persons were present to witness the operations, and the troops of the Royal Engineers and the provisional battalion were drawn up on the bank of the river and on the new iron bripdged
Ttle whole of the operatioas of this day and Tuesday passed off without the tlightest accident,
Halifax Mechanics' Institute.
HA T
...IfAX MECHANICS' IN,STITUTE.
.----- .b
A. new mechanics' institute, from designs by Messrs. Lockwood and Mawson, architects, Bradford, was opened at Halifax on Wednesday evening last, when a public soirce was held in the hail of the new building. Upwards of 600 persons were present; and among the principal guests were Lord Wharncliffe, the Hon. Edwin Lasceles, MP., Mr. F. Croasley, M.P., Mr. IL Monekton Milnes, XP., Dr. Sandwith, C.B., Mr. B. Baines, Mr. H. Edwards, Mr. E. Akroyd, Mr. J. Whitworth (Mayor of Halifax), Mr. J. Abbott, Mr. B. Wheatley, &c.
Mr. CROSSLEY, the president of the institation, presided, and read a letter from Sir C. Wood, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and one of the representatives in Parliuament for Halifax, regretting his inability, through indisposition, to attend the soirseas he had intended. The chairman said he had also received letters of apology for non-attendance from Lord Stanle; Iejrd Goderich, Sir E. B. Lytton, Sir Joseph Paxton, Sir Robert Peel, and Mr. S. Warren. The chairman concluded by caling upon
Mr. R. M. MmiLrs, M.P., who was received with much applause by the assembly, after a few introductory remarks, proceeded to say,-One difficulty of not having a resolution is that one is driven so dreadfulUy into generalities; andtherefore the one thing for me wvilbe to tal gene. raDy on perhaps national education; but that is not only a very general subject, it may also be a too particular subject. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) Not that I think that in general circumstances there is any reason why any great matter which affects the social interests of this greaS country, and which at the same time does not touch upon party politics, should not be within the capacity of these institutions. I wish these institutions to be as real as possible, and I wish them to shrink from contact with no real difficalty. At the same time I am conscious I am nob in a position to come here and give any important weight by my opinion in such a matter, and therefore it would not be wise of me to introduce it. I will merely say I hope yout will keep it in your minds, for, though it may not be in the discretion of the present or any other Governmuent to press this subject, I trust you will not forget ehe great destitution in this respect which is apparent to every man in this country. I hope you will not forget, when you walk along your streets, that there are children going along them who do not know even the very foandations of ordinary education-that you will not forget that there are growing up in this great country of ours villages, almost towns, rising at the mouth of a coalpit, or connected with the terminus of a railroad, a grand conglomeration of mankind, and that it is an important question whether the children of these places grow up heathens or Christian men. (Hear, hear.) Bat, gentlemen, there are certain subjects connected with this question which I think it may not be unadvisable that I should allUade to. There is one subject which is attracting a very great deal of attention at this moment-namely, the present condition of what is called our criminal population. (Hear, hear.) I will not touch upon that questi'jn in any political sense, because I am sure we shall have quite enough of it in the approaching session of Parliament, and, perhaps, before many months are over you may be so entirely bored with it that you will think it only a less evil than having you own houses broken into. (Laughter.) I will only touch upon this question because I w,ish you to see two matters which it is important that you and every person interested in this question should keep distinct, namely, the accidental circumstance of a large number of our criminal populationbeing thrown upon the country, and the general question as to the treatment of our criminals. Circumstances necessitated a special and, perhaps, imperfeet measure with reference to the latter, hut with this I think we have nothing to do. You know how difficult it would be for any Government to meet this question fairly; and I hope that whatever Government comes to the consideration of it we shaU weigh every proposal calmly and advisedly. You know that circumstances over which we have no control have, in a great degree, done away with that system of transportation by which so very large a portion of our criminal population was absorbed into a different state of society at the other end of the world, both for their good, because they got on very well, and for our own, because we were rid of them entirely. (Laughter, and "Hear, hear.") Circumstances, however, over wliich we have no control, but which at the same time we might have expected, necessitated such a state of thins, though I am sorry to say no preparation was made by the Administrations of this country for such a contingency and such a danger. I may also say, without regard to any party, that it is too much the habit of the Administrations of this country to act upon the Micawber principle. (Laughter.) You most of you remember Mr. Micawber in one of Mr. Dickens's books, who was always expecting something would turn up which never did. On the same principle our Governments, though expecting that the colonies wvould not continue to take the criminals out of our hands, and that the time would come when this convict population would be thrown upon the country, have gone on in the face of such a contingency ever expecting that something might turn up; the Governments have acted on the principle that something might turn up, or that they might be turned out themselves, and then it night be very comfortable to put an opponent in a fix. (Hear, hear.) I do not see what is to be the result of this state of things, but beyond and above that is the question of how we are to provide for that large portion of our population from which the great part of our criminals spring. That is a great question-that is a reformatory question-that is an educational question-and a question which it is within the compass of every one of us, in some degree, to assist in examining and solving. (Hear, hear.) Therefore I caU upon you, as far as you can possibly bend your minds in the matter, to assist in every good work prosecuted for that object. (Hear, hear.) I would also make a general remark, that it is important, in the education of the people of this country, to have regard to their political development. I know very well that politics are excluded nominally from every such society as this, but I also know that an old man and a great philosopher a long time ago said, " I call everything political that has to do with the human soul and its improvement." And it is the genius of the English people to make all great national questions more or less political, and therefore I am satisfied youn mnst never for a moment suppose that you can keep asunderyourintellectualand pohtical existence; with this satisfaction, however, to ourselves, that everything that educates you to become intelligent men will educate you to be good and honourable citizens. Therefore it is that I cannot understand that any man should be the opponent of education who is at the same time favourable to the poHtical advancement of the people. The two things must go together, for only in proportion as the people of this country are fairly educated-in proportion as their intelligence is fairly developed and fairly used- will be the extension of the political power which mayhbe given. In that point of view, and with these convictions, I see no reason whatever why any of us should distrust any extension of political power to the masses of this country, provided that such extension of political power be accompanied with sound universal education. (H ear, hear.) Ladies and gentlemen, you have met for the first time this evening in this beautiful room. You will, many of you, have come to it with past associations, with influences that cannot fil to be of advantage, and which, I have no doubt, are vividly present to many of you. You will remember what the institution has been, and in this splendid edifice you willsee what it may be. (Hear, hear.) I will call upon the young men of Halifax to make this place the great public school, the university of this town. (near,
ear.) You know it has been said of these institutions that they have not exactly answered the expectations of their founders. No doubt, Dr. Birkbeck intended them to apply almost entirely to the artisan class-; whereas they nave become the institution, generally, of the great middle classes of this country. I should regret this the more if I did not see that there are everywhere also rising up, side by side with these institutions, other institutions especially adapted to what are celled the working classes. You have most of you heard of the People's College in Loudon,andof a similarinstitution in Sheffield and other towns; and the other day the University of London passed a decree attaching to its body the People's College of London and giving to itsmembers all the Privileges and all the advantages of a greatcentral University in thiskingdom. (Hear.) I considerthatavery greatboontotheworkmigmenof this country, because I believe that the working men of this country are the real stamina from which al our greatness proceeds. HEear, hear.) Gentlemen, I remember some tine ago meeting a man in the highest position in society (and I mention this as an illustration of what I have stated), who told me that he believed the happiest conceivable life was that of a man born in the lowest position, compatible with a good education, rsing gradually by his own efforts until he attains the highest social position in his native country. (Applause.) Lot us thank God that this is possible for every one of us, and that we live in a country where we may fairly say so. (Rear, hear.) It was only the other day that an instance presented itself which strikes me the more forcibly because it was connected with a similar institution to this in a town which I have the honour to represent, .Pontefract. A citizen of that town told me he was the son of a small shopkeeper, from which he had risen to a position of high respect in that sown from his own exertions, having received lisa mechanical education in a mechanics' institute. That gentleman is not unknownhere; it was Mr. Wood,
he iventor of improved machinery for the manufacture of carpets. (Hear, hear.) Such are the results of individual exeri on, and therefore it was that I vvsastonip the.

Lot us take two young men in the same rank of life commencing the world together, the one well educated, and having all his powers carefully trained and developed -the other ignorant, and his intelloctual Powers dormant -does it not stand to reason that the one would hs much more likely to give way when exposed to temptation than the other! (Hear, hear.) Don't you a' oir suppose that the quicker perception whieh intelligence gives will enable a mpn to see that. an honest and jost course of life is more likely to lead him to prosperity an-1 virtue than if he pursues his way in ignorance ? Hear, hear.) I am sure you aLre not the persons to admit such a fallacy-I amn sure you are not the persons to admait such a conclusion as that drawn by n imes. Therefore I call upon you, the young men especially, to take advantage of this institution, so that when you leave this place you

your career in life; ard ul s, in after and maturer year3, you come back again as Ohe honoured citizens of the town of which you are now inbhabitants, yon will perhaps not have felt any regret that on a certain evening, such a, this, you attended at the inauguration of this building. Ladies and gentlemen, these feelings are Atron in all of us, and you cannot realize them be-'er thaa by making the instruetion given in this institution real and earnest. Every day impresses us more with the necessity of your making education something real and earnest. Do not, wben you come here for help and amusement, think that that is all the education you require, for, although if amusement is judicious, it is almost as good as instruction something more is required. God requires that all the powers He has given to man sbould be cultivated-not only his powers of learning and receiving, but also his powers of sympathy and general interest. Attach imrportance to all those things; foHow the course of lectnres in this hall, even upon subjects to the bottom of which you have not gone. rollow them with that intelligent interest which is in itself good, and which will lead to still better things. Don't by any means distrust your power to acqnire knowledge; for anything you may acquire here will perhaps conie out hereafter in a way you little expected. (Hear, hear.) Make ths hall the great testing place of your own mental powers, and then I am sure that great advantage will result from this institution. (Hear, hear.) Don't be discouraged; have confidence that the honest, earnest work of each of you, even at the moment when it seems to be but thrown away, will, like the grain of mustard seed, enlarge and extend, and become a benefit to mankind. Don't let any Englishman distrust his ow-n powers. Know that you are English citizens, Englishmen living under one of the wisestlconstitntions, and in the hap. piest society God has placed upon this earth. Use these means well, and then you -wiU bless this institution. (Lend cheers)
The CHAIRMANt then stated that Mr. Brown, who left Halifax when a boy, and went to London, and who had Iisen to eminefice as a merchant and partner in the house of Messrs. Todd, Morrison, and Co., had sent, without solicitation, 100 guineas towards this institution. (Cbeers.)
The Hon. E. LASCELLES, ALP., briefly acknowledged the honour which had been done him by inviting him to be present on that occasion, and then proceeded to refer to the reformation of juvenile offenders. It was a subject in which he had taken considerable interest in conjunction with Mr. Wbeabley, who was present. A reformiatory institution lad been established at Mirfield. (Applause.) It was carried on at present on a very small scale, but the public would see very shortly a scheme for its extension which he hoped would meet with the supportof the whole Riding. He would state publicly that they had advantages which no other establishment possessed. As the establishment needed increased accommodation, M1r. Wbeatley had been good enough to say that he would give sufficient land, provided funds could be found. (Applause.) He n.w merely gavo the information that such an tstablishment existed, and had been in exiAtence for a year. They would see a report in a few days, and if they thought well of it ho hoped they would give the managing committee the mreans for increasing that institution. (Hlear, hear.) He believed the scheme to be quite practicable, and the success of it, so far a3 it had gone, gave the managing committeo ample hope that they would do considerable good. When tho public saw the good that had been done, and the prospect of more, he hoped they would give their aid to that institution. (Applause.)
Lord WHtAARNcL-FF, on rising, was greeted with loud cheering. Hle said-Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I claim your indulgence on two grounds-first, that 1 an, as you will perceive, a young man, and am not very much accustomed, as they say, to public speaking; and also because I am descended from those who in former 3ears were connected with this town. I believe that my grandfather, as lord-lieutenant of the county, won the esteem and admiration of all; and my uncle, the present Solicitor-General, also gained the esteem of t-he great mass of this great community. (Applause.) On the last-I believe not the onlyoccasion he represented you he won his election by only or.e vote, and that one man, depend upon it, is now a n.ember of this Mechanics' Institution. (Applause and luighter.) Ladies and gentlemen, as we have met here on a particular occasion, I wish to say to you one or two words. It must be a difficult thing, after a hard day's work in the factory, to come here and read those stiff books that make one's brain ache and eyes water to pore over. (A laugh.) I confess I find it to be so, though I have a comfortable library, and almost alwaysgotosleepoverthem. (Renesved laughter.) I like the periodicals best. They appeal to one's feelings in a moment, by speaking of that which is passing paround at the present time. When you read of gaUant actions, of decds of daring, of perseverance, of success, and
rosperity in life of those who are around you whom you now, you naturally feel much more interested in them than in the lives and exploits of those who were very resectable gentlemen in their day, but are now down in the dus. In the early part of my life I wandered about the world a good deal, and among other places visited Australia, where I proceeded to the "diggins." There you would have thought, of all places in the world, the men of strong arms and muscles have gone ahead but I assure yoae this was not the case. (Hear, hear.3 Those men wen' ahead there who possessed knowledge, and intelligence to apply it. The man of strong sinews dug the gold; but it was the man of education and intelligence who put it in his pocket. (Loud applause.) I saw there men holding most responsible situations-clerks in merchants' countinghouses, clerks in banks, and so forth-who had landed in that country without any money in their pockets. I have seen men there who on landing had sold everything to go off to the "diggins." There they dng five or ten ounces of gold, and with it returned to the town, where they at once applied it to purchasing that which would give them a respectable appearance. This done, they obtained situations. Here they saved their money, and when they had got togetber 400L or 5001. started on their own account. (Hear, hear.) Why, I met with one man there who literally started with nothing; and yet helhadcamassed 7,000. or 8,0001. within four or five years, by his own ind.stry and intelligence. (Applause.) Therefore I wish to impress upon the yOUng men present that even in such countries as
that-and how much more so in this ?-it is not the man who has tl:e strong sinews, hut he who has intclligence and education, that carries off the honour and the gold.
Mr. E. B. WTIEATLEY was introduced by the chair. man, in terms warmly approving his efforts in the cause of juvenile reformatories. In the course of his speech Mr. Wheatley said that mechanics' institutions had two I faults; the first was that they did not consist of mechaics,
though it was scarcely tenable, he believed, in the case of Halifax. Another objection was thatthey were institutions for amusement rather than instruction. Be believed that light literature had the greatest demand at these institutions. This was natural when they remembered that the members had previously undergone a hard day's work before going to the institution. There was, no doubt, in most institutions of this kind a want of that inducement to the acqinsition of knowledge which would lead working nien to incur the trouble and fatigue of study after a hard day's labour. But he was happy to say that this inducement was now being made more clear and palpable. The Society of Aits were about, in the early part of the present year, to offer substantial rewards to those members of mechanics' institutions who proved their zeal and diligence in study, and herurged the members of the Halifax Institation to work hard in the classes to qualify themselves for this honourable competition. (Applause.)
Mr. E B. iXEs congratulated the members of the institution and the inhabitants of Halifax generally upon the opening of such a splendid buildir,g-a building which, to far as he had seen, would be one of the most complete in the country. (Hear, hear.) He contrasted the present position of mechanics' institutes with that which they ocoupied when first established, and then alluded to the examination of the Society of Arts, on which occasion, he said, prizes to the amount of not less than v001. or 6N00. would be distributed, vwhile every one who was entitled to it would receive a certificate of merit, which could not but be of the greatest value. There was, therefore, every encouragement for young men to persevere in their studies. He was glad that Mr. Wvheatley had referred to the subject, the more so as he had observed that they had excellent class accommodation in their institution; so that every one coming to it, whether from the cottage, the mill, or wherever else he might follow his avoction^-, might study with as much comfort, and no less zeal and aiduity, as the noble Lord in his drawing room the studies to whicb he had devoted himself. (Applause.) He did not altogether agree withlthe noble LXord(LordWhaarncliffe) inwbat he said inregard toreading; and it should be reembered that his Lordship had the opPortunity of laying the foundation of his education before he proceeded on his travels. (Hear, hear.) He did not agree with the article in The Times to which the hon. member for Pontefract had alluded, ncr with another article in the same journal. hc Times seemed to think that the examinations of the Society of Arts were likely to injure the health and Etrength, the vigour and stamina, of the working classes. He did not himself believe that there was any reason whatever to fear anything of the kind. (EHear hear.) When in London some time since, he heard a course of lectures by Mr. M'Culloch, now at the head of the Stationery-office, in which that gentleman contended that the manual occupations of the working classes were so entirely different from what they learnt at mechanics' institutes that they would find their studies at the institutes a recreation after the labonrs of the day. (Applause.) All industrial occupathons, or at leastthe great mass of the industrial arsses, were, when empuloyedi, actively exer-
cai5ng their bodily powers, while ther minds wore ahnost unemployed. But hours spent at 'ho mechanics' institution were honrs of bodily rest and mental work; and he thought theywould find that two or three hoursinthe evening might be safely, honourably, aDd happily employed by men who had passed their day in manual labour. (Hear.) Be happened to know a considerable number of persons in some of the best mechanics' institutes of Yorkshire who were labouring men. Who was the professor of mathematicsthe most ardent teacher of mathematics-in the Huddersfield Mechanics' Institution at the present time ? He was a labonuring mason, who had made such proficiency himself, that he loved to bring others forward; and when he was offered remuneration said, " No, I feel so much pleasure in it that I will not accept remuneration." (" Hear, hear," and applanse.) Many of the teachers in the mechanics' institutes of Leeds, Huddersfield, Wakefield, and other places ho (Mr. BAines) could remember as lads in their classes. (Hes, hear.) He could also name capitalists, manufacturers, merchants, who had made their own fortunes, who when lads were students in mechanics' institutions. (Applause.) He agreed with the hon. member for Pontefract that, though there were many
lamentable instances of fraud and dishonesty among edu. I cated men, yet the tendency of education was towards virtue. (Applause.) If they saw every man in the country educated, they would have less of drunkenness, less of licentiousness, and more of virtue, for thereby the tastes and aspirations of men would be made Ligher. He could not but observe that England had now a much more elevated population than it had possessed even in his earlier days. This elevation had been the tendency of things within his remembrance. The workinclasses had been very much elevated during his lifetime, a,d ihey should continue to improve and extend education, believing, as he did, that it was one of the greatest boons that could be offered to a people. (Applause.) After again adverting to the examination of the Society of Arts, he
said he did not agrea with Mr. Mmlnes as to the establish. snent of people's colleges side by side with mechanics' in. stitutions, believing that evil resulted from too great a multiplication of institutions having the same object in one town. His (Mr. Baines's) hope was that mcrhanics' institutes would become the people's colleges; that they would so turn their attention to claEs instruction, that they would get such teachers, and draw so large a portion of the people into them, that they would become the colleges of the people. If they did their work well, he did not sea thatanotherstitutionneed bor raed up besidethem. He
wishe to SeLeYthe fulfil then purpoes fofwar people's rolege by extending and improving their class instruction. (A.pplause.) In conclusion Nr. Baines uroed a house-to-house
cOafnvass as tthe best means of securing t'Tsepermuanent successj
ceived in a very enthusiastic manner. lie expressed his concurrence in the suggestion of Mr. Baines as to canvass for members, observing that though they had got a splendid institution success could only be achieved by steady personal application. If the institution was to thrive, the artisans must make it their own. It was no use repining at their position; they must apply themselves to the opportunities which presented thewselves in this institute, and, by combining work, improvement, and recreation, raise their social position. (Hear, hear.) He thought the directors bad acted wisely in making this building complete, though in doing so they had incurred a heavy debt. The building looked exceedingly well, but would look ten times better if they did not see the ghostly speetre of this 4,0G01. sitting upon it. It was a ghost, however, that they had only to set their willing hearts upon to remove, and he hoped an effort would be made that night to accomplish so desirable an object. (Hear, hear.) "In conclusion," said Mr. Crossley, "I have to make a proposition, which is, that this debt be paid by January 1,
lf61; and I am now prepared to give, at any time between now and then, when this debt can be paid, 5001 (Leud cheers.) Inorder that you may not be in any way out of pocket in the meantime, I will give 5 per cent. on that sum until it is paid, on the condition, however, that if it is not paid by the 1st of January, 1861, I shall be free from my promise both as to the principal and the interest." (Loud cheers.)
The Mayor of HALIFAX (Mr. J. Whitworth), next addressed the meeting at great length. He alluded tothe known liberality of Mr. Akroyd and Mr. F. Crossley, and expressed a strong hope that the debt would at once bo removed from the building. (Rear, hear.) After giving an account of a visit to the Huddersfield Mechanics' Intitution. be concluded by pointing out the advantages which the Halifax society offered to all who would avai themselves of them.
Dr. SIXDWIrTr was received with much applause on nising to address the meeting. le said he had been absent from this country eight years, and had not had couch occasion for public speaking .Such a sceno as the one before him, peculiarly English, was not allowed in any continental country. He remembered the time when mechanics' institutes were looked upon with suspicion and distaste by the higher classes. Thank God, that time had passed, and the lower classes were now a somewhat educated people. (Anplause.) For instance, who did not remember the letters from the private soldiers who had fought in the Crimea ? He had, however, found on his return home the want of a great system of State education. (Hear, hear.) Notwithstanding voluntaryeducation given in mechanics' institutions, a great work among the poor was still required, and he urged that efforts ought to be put forth to obtain a thorough system of State education. He deprecated too much ireddling by Government, but in this particularhe thought the Government ought to exercise a care for the education of the young. He congratulated the members of this institution, and recom. mended the younger members to study the scienees. Speakmng as a traveUer, he could tell how his previous study of natural history had made his travels a delight, and how much he regretted the want of knowledge. He concluded a brief speech by urging the members to the assiduous pursuit of knowledge.
The CHAIRMAS read a list of the principal subscriptions to the building fund of the new institution, amounting to the sum of 2,G401.
On the motion of Mr. H. EDWARDS, seconded by Mrr. E. ARROYD, a vote of thanks was ivon to the visitors.
Lord WJL.RNCLiFFES acknowledged the compliment, and the proceedings, were closed with votes of thanks to the chairman and the ladies.

Conviction And Sentence For Will Forgery.
CONVICTION AND SENTENCE FORt WNi. FORGERY. -AttlhelHigh Court of Juaticiary,Edinburgh,on Wedniesday last, Dr. DH ius Wielobycki,who had been convicted on the Friday previous of forgery and uttering of a fabricated will, wa-s senter ced to 14 years' transportation. The prisoner, ornirgilly a,elish refugee, had for 12 or 13 years practised as a homoeopathic physician E ldinburgh, his income having latterly approached to 1,200( He had borne a respectable character, and bad generally won the confidence and regard of his patients. He had been called some years ago to attend a family of elderly persons in Portobello, of whom only one, Mi Isabella Darling, now survived, and so great influence had ho obtained over them that he had managed to secure possesseon of all their funds, about4,000&.,with the viewofinvestingthem fortheir benefit. Thomas Darling, who died in April, 1856, left his property by will. to his two Eisters. Margaret ;nd Isabella, excluding his nephews and nieces by other sisters. Margaret died in the October following, and, after an opinion had been obtained from counsel to the effect that, Margaret having died intestate, the nephews and nieces could not by Thomas's will be excluded from their proportion of Margaret's share the prisoner next day uttered a document pretending to io a will of MArgaret conveying herproperty to Isabella. From the evidence it appeared that Isabela, a weak, facile, and ignorant womau, had transcribed the wiiU from scrolls supplied by the prisoner and forged the signature, and that,after it had been uttered by the prisoner and challenged as a forgery by the agent for the nephews and nieces, the prisoner and Isabella Darling destroyed it between them, and a compromise was made with the claimants for 1,200L, vhich nearly amounted to their rightful share. The evidence also sbowed that the prisoner had got a will in his favour from Isabella Darling, that he had received considerable sums from the family for rmedical attendance, agency, &-c.; that they bad also intrusted to him about 5001. in notes and silver coin which they bad hoarded,without receiving any receipt or acknowledgment. AR the correspondence of the family in dismssing the former and employing a new lasw agent, and in transacting their pecuniary affairs, for a year and a-half was either written by the prisoner or by Isabella from scrolls supplied by him, Isabelfa stating in the witnes3box that she very often did not understand what the doctor _gave ber to wite. In passin sentence, the Lord Justice Clerk remarked to offence was not only of the gravest description of the class of forgery, but it was all the more flagrant that it had been committed by a medical adviser intruding himself into the pecuniary affairs of his patients. The judges at the trial bad in this case consulted all the other judges of the Court, and they found them all firmly and decidedly of opinion that, notwithstanding the recommendation of the jury to leniency on the ground of former go character, no exception to the course of practice could be made in this case, and the Court felt they had no alternative but to sentencea the prisoner to transportation beyond the sea for the period of 14 years. The trial and its result have occasionedgreat sensation in Edinburgh, where the prisoner was extensively known.
The Overland Route.
TrE OVERZArD ROUTE.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-I am instructed bythe Board of Directors to request your insertion of the following observations in reply to the, not "very brief letter," signed "An Old Traveller," whichappears in Tiw Times of the 13th inst.
Your correspondent prefaces his complaints with a very, glowing commendation of the treatment experienced or, board the Colombo between Southampton and Alexandria, praising the ship, the captain, and the cabins, the cultine;
the wines, and the viands; but he looks upoil all these ass, lure and a bait, a "highly-coloured picture," held up toinduce passengers to undertake a jaurney, the second hal£ of which is left to "chance-medley," or something that might turn up, and in respect of which no forethought is exercised. Now, as the "swift and strong ship " and aln the good things enumerated are stern and costly realities, the directors think that the "highly-coloured picture" is. exhibited by the " Old Traveller" for the purpose of contrast with his own painting of other scenes and objects, theL fidelity of which they now proceed to test by a comparison with facts.
There were provided at Suez, for the purpose of forward. ing the 140 passengers by the Colombo to their journey's. end, the Bengal, with berths for 118, and the Norna, with berths for G0 first-class passengers, the former bound for Calcutta and the latter for Bombay; and these two vessels were provisioned with stores furnished by the s contractors, and identical in quaUty and price witF Wose so. much approved on board the Colombo, all, whether perishable or not, being supplied from the company's store at Suez, which is constantly replenished by stocks conveyed to Alexandria in their own steamers.
It happened on the particular voyage in question that. the passengers proceeding to Bombay were much snore numerous in proportion than those bound for Calcutta; and the directors had, much against their wiU and practice, yielded to the urgent appeals of some applicants who were late in booking (the " Old Traveller" most likely among them), and to the assurances given that any inconvenience would be cheerfully submitted to, and had received more Bombay passengers into the Colombo than they would have done under ordinary circumstances, but still only filling the first-class berths.
On arrival at Bombay 10 or 12 passengers who occupied berths in the fore parb of the Norna, of whom the " Old Traveller" was one, addressed the directors, through their agent at Bombay, representing.tl.at they had experienced annoyance from their proximitv to the quarters of the servants and the crew, and demanding a refund of passage money. Although the directors were charged in this letter with a "deliberate intention" to break the contract with their passengers (the " Old Traveller" is more guarded in that intended for your columns), they took no notice of the want of propriety in the language in which it was couched, but they instructed their agent by return of post-namely, on the 26th ult., to refund 15C. to each of the passengers who had been so situated.
The thermometer in the cabin of the Norna is stated to have stood gencrally at 1100, owing to its being " badly ventilated ;" on reference to the ship's log for the voyage, it has been found that the mean of the thermometer in theshade on desk during the passage down the Red Sea was 88°, a condition of the atmosphere sufficient to account for great. and oppressive heat in the cabins of a steamship.
It is true that the speed of the Norna suffers somewhat wlhen compared with that of the Colombo, but it must be borne in mind that the latter much exceeded the rate stipulated for in the mail contrac'.
It should also be mentioned that the company's contract for the Bombay mail service terminates at Aden, at which place it is provided that the mails and passengers shall be transferred to and received from the larger steamers on the Calcutta and Suez line. For the convenience, however, of the Bombay community and the public the steamers on the Bombay and Aden line, all of which exceed the contract size, are run up to Snez,-an arrangement which, while it entails a heavy expense on the company, entirely refates the assumption of an " Old Traveller" that the directors think their duty ended when the passengers are landed at Alexandria. If farther refutation of such an assertion be requisite, it will be found in the fact that the company have at this time 16 steamers on the Indian side of the Isthmus of Suez, besides those engaged as transports to the, Persian Gulf and in local services.
Having adverted to those parts of the journey in respect of which the company may be fairly held amenable for any shortcomings, it now remains to refer to that part of it which is wholy beyond their control,-namely, the transit through Egypt. For the convenience of travellers the directors include in the fare for a passago to India the amount charged by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of the passengers from Alexandria to alongside the company's steamer at Suez; each passenger is furnished with a little book containing all the tariffs and regulations of the transit administrations. The "Old Traveller" could not, therefore, have been ignorant that the directors have no share in any of the arrangements, and had he been. guided by a desire to be just and accurate lie would not have omitted to absolve the company in respect of all matters connected with his " pilgrimage" to Snez. He is also wrong in making the company responsible for his grievances at the Suez Hotel; the company have nothing to do with that establishment, either directly or indirectly.
Notwithstanding all the " Old Traveller" has w-ritten respecting this, evidently his frst trip overland, the directors have the satisfaction of knowing that important improvements have been made in the transit, and that if a traveller of less exuberant fancy had compared existing with past arrangements he would have noted great progress in every way. The misfortune of having occasionally to occupy a third-class carriage, owing to neglect or accident,. is not unaknown to first-class ticketholders even in this country. A proper representation of the circumstances usually obtains attention and redress. In the case of the "' Old Traveller" and his companions the company had already undertaken to seek that redress at the hands of the Transit Administration, and the directors are bound to state that it is the practice of the Egyptian Government to meet all such representations with promptitude and liberality.
The letters of " Expositor" and " Another Traveller," in The Timcs of yesterday, are to a great extent answered in the foregoing. On the subject of passage-money, however, it is right to state that the company did not raise their fares on becoming contractors for the Bombay mails; on the other hand, they have recently made a general reduction in conSequence of a diminution in the cost of coals, and they challenge a comparison of their present rates with those of any ocean company on the only correct basis,-namely, a rate per head per mile.
On the morning of the 13th a gentleman, a perfect stranger to the directors, called at the company's offices, stating that he had been induced to do so by the discrepancy between the reports he and his family had received from his sister, a passenger by the Norna on the voyage in question, and those of an " Old Traveller," and he has been kind enough to send them the extract of one of her letters and the bill of fare enclosed herewith, showing that the table was supplied with abundance and variety; and when fair allowance is made for the impossibility of providing eatables equal in point of freshness to those obtainable on the voyage to Alexandria, and for the difficulty of setting food on the table of a steamer in the Indian Ocean during the hot season, with the thermometer at 90' on the deck, in a manner that shall be inviting to the eye and provoking to the palate, thc directors feel they are entitled to credit for what is achieved, rather than to be exposed to £nfair and unmerited obloquy for alleged neglect of the passengers by their vessels.
Such writers as tho " Old Traveller," and others, would add much weight to their statements if they could point out any way by which the company would be benefited by such a disregard of the comfort of travellers as they accuse them of. The company have to contend against the powerful competition of the steamers and saiing ships, vi4 the Cape, and hence it is their interest as much as it is their prsde and duty to maintain and increase the attractions of the overland route.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

PROFESSOR SAFFI'S LECTURES.-Yesterday even-
