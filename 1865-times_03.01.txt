TORTURE IN INDIA. The Earl of ALBEIXIARLE said,-I beg to move that the returns which I have placed on the notice-paper be laid on the table of the house. All these xeturns are intended as notes and illustrations to a blue-book which has lately been laid before both Houses of Parliament, appropriately headed " Torture." In this official folio of 325 pages your lordships will find cnumerated a series of atrocious cruelties perpetrated upon Her Majesty's male and female subjects within the Presidency of Madras by Government offlcers, for Government purposes. Sometimes, as the report states, torture is resorted to for the purpose of extracting confessions in criminal and police cases; at others, for the purpose of extorting an arbitrary and excessive revenue; at others, for what, under the old French izsiime, was Imown as corae, compulsory labour on public works; and at others, again, after the old fashion of negro slavery in our colonies, to enforce compulsory and unrequited labour, with this difference, that whereas in the West Indies the extraction of labour by means of the whip was for the benefit of private individuals, here it is in order to enrich the Govermment, to which the people are entitled to look for the protection of their property and their persons. Into the horrible details of this volume it is not, at this moment, my intention to enter. I shall invite your lordships' attention to it at a more favourable period. In the meantime, I would most respectfully entreat your lordships to peruse the contents of this volume. Youwill there see that those grievous wrongs which, in common with other members of your lordships' House, I have, from to time, brought before your notice are realities ; your lordships will also see what atrocities are committed under the name of British rule in India. The first return for which I move is a reprt from a certain judge in the Sapreme Criminal Court of Madras. Thewriter, MEr.MalcolmLewin, was a judge who served the East India Company with great fidelity for many years, and passed from the office of Circuit Judge to that of Judge of the Sudder Adawlut, the court of the highest criminal and civil jurisdiction in India. The report is to all intents and purposes a torture report. It is dated Septembcer, 140, and up to this year no attention has been paid to its statements. There i a strong family resemblance between the report of 1840 and this report of 1855, and the one throws light upon and corroborates the statements of the other. Both tally in the description they give of those offlcers to whom the East India Company has intrusted the lives andproperty of the people of hadras. They give those officers the same character for rapacity, cruelty, and tyranny. Mr. Lewin statesthatthere is nodegreeof guiltwhich apoliceofficer wiU hesitate to incur when the object is to convict. He states that the as freqently figure a gang robbers as in their proper g, an that their cruelties are systematic and universaL With respect to torture he says, "Torture is almost universal in this distict"-the district being double the circuit of an English judge. He gives instances of them, but of course he does not give as many instances as are contained in the report of last year, or any of equal atrocity. What he states is sufficiently appaling. He says, " One prisonerappears before me with the loss of an arm from maltreatment, the amputation having been performed after the prisoner reached the court." He then states, "Two prisoners appear with their bodies branded, the sores still fresh, and the arms of one of them swollen from the effects of a tight ligature." If your lordships wiLsh to know the description of torture by tight ligature applied to the arms of prisoners you will find it throughout this report of 1855 ; but I prefer referring your lordships to a despatch of the Court of Directors themselves, under the date of 1826, to be found at the beginning of this volume. Now, my lords, I ask, would it be possible under a responsible Government-by which I mean a Government directly opposed to that which now exists-to subject these unfortunate inhabitants for 15 years to such a horde of thieves as these officers are described in this report after the facts had been brought to the knowledge both of the local and the home Government7 But it is not a case of 15 years' wrongdoing; it is a case of 50 years. Your lordships will find from the evidence that the East India Company have been cognizant of the principle of torture existing in India from the year 1806. Hero is proof of torture extending over a poplulation nearly as large as our own, and over a territory hafas large again as the united kingdom, and yet such has been the mystification of an irresponsible Government that the first knowledge of the existence of torture, communicated either to Parliament or the country, is by this bluebook, which is almost wet from the printers' hands. (Hear hear.) My lords, it is with difficulty that I can express myself upon a subject so painfully harrowing. {Hear, hear.) Arn attempt has been made to draw a distinction between torture for extorting confession and torture for extracting revenue. The attempt has been made in a despatch which, if your lordships allow it to be placed on the table, I shall subject to a severe analysis-the despatch of the 12th of September, 1855, from the Court of Directorsto the Government of Madras. The distinction is an evasion. The torturer in police cases and the torturer in revenue cases are one and the same person. By a most atrocious and wicked regulation, continued, I believe, from 1806 to the present day, the revenue and police offices are blended, and thus the administration of justice is avowedly rendered subservient to the collection of revenue. I have spoken of the character of these torturers. Another important point is their number. I shall, therefore, move for the number of native officers employed in the joint conduct of the police and the coliection of land and other revenues in the several provinces of the Presidency of Madras, and I am sure, when this return meets your lordships' eyes, you wil be utterly astonished and appaled at the enormous proportion these trthurersbear to their unhappy victims. I shaU also move for a return of the number of native officers who have committed malversation, corruption, torturing, and other crimes. One peculiar effect of this system is the infamous character which, from the begining, all the officers have borne in whom irresponsible power has been lodged. Sir T. Manro stated that, in 1841, out of 100 superior officers, there were only six whe had not been convicted of peculation, and these persons, from1806 to the presentyear, have continued in the irresponsible administration of the revenue and police. This report states that the excessive revenue is the cause of torture. No other conclusion can be come to by anyone acquainted with the system but that it is impossible the revenue can be coUected without torture. 'Under the native government of India, a twelfth, a sixth, and, lastly, a maximum revenue of one-fourthof the gross produce was levied by the State. When the Mahomedans took possession of the country they, regarding themselves as true believers and the Hindoos as heretics, and being also conquerors, doubled the tax, and, when we Christians succeeded to them, we adopted their reasonin= and accepted the doubled tax. It would have been well iE we had stopped there, but by arbitrary exactions, and by an absurd system of collecting the revenue by means of IrTesponsible gang robbers, we have actually doubled the amount of taxation and brought it up to 100 per cent. Of course, under such circumstances, it is impossible to collect revenue, except by means of torture. This blue-book will show the inhumanity and craelty of that practice. The returns I now move for will show its impolicy. The next return which I move for is the amount of property which formed the subjects of trials in the courts of justice. My reason for moving for that return is that, having been in communication with avery intelligent gentlemanwho has discharged the office of a judge in that country, he said that he regarded as an alarming indication of the wretched state of the people of Madras the smallness of the amounts of property in litigation; and the retun I ask for will, I thinkl, show not only the smuallness of the value of property in dispute, but also the number of suitors, and thus prove the impoverished condition into which that country has been brought by English govern,ment. Another return which I ask fOr is of the total amount of the land-tax and the number of contributories. My object is to show to your lordships and the country the enormous number of contributors to the land-tax, the smallness of their holdings, and consequently their excessive poverty, and the utter impossibility on the part of the Indian Government, or of any Government, especially a Government of strangers, to collect the revenue without resort to oppressive measures. These returns will go to show the extent of the evils under which Indiais suffering. The nextreturn isto enableyourlordships to examine the remedies which are proposed for these evils. I have an utter disbelief in the efficacy of those remedies, or of any remedy except that of placing a hundred and odd millions of people in India on an equality with the inhabitants of other Crown possessions, byngving them the benefit of a responsible Government. I-wish to see the amount of the taxation-its large nominal amount and really small produce. I believe that hitherto what are called remissions are, in fact, formal renunciations of pro- ey that cannot be collected, because there is nobody who S able to pay it. In this, a;nd in other matters, I think it is the duty of the egislature to regard with more than ordinary mistrust anything which proceeds from the Indian Government, which has ever been most merciless in its administration whenever iscal matters were concerned. In that desnatch which I have moved for the House wiU find materials for much deliberation, and, although it has been said that the Government of this countryare to some extent responsible, thatis onlytrueaccordingtothe letter of thelaw, for where there is, as in this case. a divided responsibility the result is really no responsibility at alL The Government is of course in theory partly responsible for the letter which I now move for; but what a pretty responsibility it is which permits torture to be inflicted during Slyears among 22,000,000 of people, without any one here being aware of it ! So long as there is not a double government but a double agency in Indian affairs while the Indiahouse and Cannon-row have each a control in Indian governrment-so long it will be absurd to speak of responsibility in the Government. No doubt, in some resoects the act of 1853 was a gain. It made a portion of the directors responsible to somebody. By that act the 24 directors were reduced to 18 in number-three of whom are, and six will hereafter be, nonminees of the Crown. They will forni a responsible body, but the remaining 12 directors elected by the ladies and gentlemen who happen -to hold Indian scrip are responsible to no man, woman, or child-not even to their own constituents, and yet they are invested with most extraordinary powers. They may spend and do spend enormous sums in guzzling, and I have seen it reported in the public papers that the responsible head of the Indian Government m the other HIouse hIs stated that it depends upon the interpretation of the words of an act of Parliament whether he had any control over the expenditure of money to an immense amount in a pro- tracted and expensive litigation. Those directors can elect .superor law ofcerswisthout any person having a right to question the fitness c-f their appointments. They can recali any servant, civil or military, from the Governor.General dowfn to the iwor ensign of their army, nithout asking the permission of any one. I have thonght it right to bring the subject beforc your lordships, and now I ask whether the present sta'e of things is consistent, Iwill not say 'with com-j mon sense-for upcon that point we should, I1 am sure, be. ansimous-but IS it consistent with the principles of the' constitution 7 The noble earl then formaA moved for tho returns of which he had given notice. Earl GRANVILLE.-I was mot prepared by the notice I of my noble friend for his entering into the qustion as to whether or not it is necessary to retain a board of directors for the govermnent of India. That is a great question, but, whetherrightlyor wrongly, it is no less true thatthree years ago in this house, after much inquiry and debate, a decision upon thatpoint was adopted by an enormous majority of your lordships' House. Al I can do is to repeat to the fullest extent what my noble friend had referred to as ny expression on a former occasion, that the Government is responsible for misgovernment in India. As to the returns for which the noble earl has moved, they wivl cause much trouble and expense, and some delay consequent upon the necessity of referring to India for certarn iormation; but the Govermnent are so anxious that no information should be refused upon this great and important questionthat we do not intend to offer the least objection to the production of the documents which the noble earl asks for. Lord MONTEAGIE sai d, the subject brought under their notice was one of the most ainful which could occupy their lordships' attention. Ye% for one, would enter his protest against the supposition that the last India act was, as states by his noble friend the Lord President, the result of due deliberation, because he believed it to be a piece of most inconsiderate and hasty legislation. (Hear, hear.) But what induced him now to offer a fewv remarks to their lordships was the enormons abuse, the existence of which was proved by the papers lately published. He did not think that at the time the last bil was underdiscussion there 'was any one among their lordships who believed it possible that a system of torture should prevail in any part of the British donminions. (Hear, hear.) They had read some years ago the tifyin account of a French traveller as to the state of British =Idia; they had heard that the native word signifying destruction and desolation was forgotten in those parts of India under British rule; yet they now found that a system of torture was in existenÃ¯Â¿Â½c there, extending over a wide area, and affecting a very large number of people. In former times Englishmen evinced a noble indignation at the injustice and oppression of such men as Warren Hastings in the government of India; but those - were iniquities of individuals rather than the iniquities of a wade-spruad system. In the present case, however, every Englislhman would blush at the discosures of this blue-book, for, to make the baseness of the system equal to its injustice, the low, sordid, contemptible object in view was to get a little more money out of the wretched and broken-down people of India. T'he glory of England was more overshadowed by the publication of this bool than by any oocurrence which -had taken place smce our possession of India, and unless the fact had come to us-on official authority, nobody would have believed that such an iniquitous system existed He acknowledged that the Government, as soon as they became acquainted with the real state of things, had acted resolutely and earnestly, w.ith a desire to probe the subject to the very bottom, and to lay before Partiament the whole result of their investigations; and at the present moment, while Englishmen were lamentng over the loss of their honour by the msfeasance of the representatives of the East india Company, their consolation was that every possible means were being taken for the correction of those evils. {Hear.) The Earl of CAENARVON much regietted that the report referred to by the noble earl entirely confirmed the uspicions ,which had been entertained of the existence of torture in India, and of the method in which it was applied. When he considered the character of the abuses which existed, and that this system of torture had been carried on in the presence of eye-witnesses, and when he reflected how nearly the subjecb concerned our national honour, he could not help feeling that the ignorance which allowed such evilstogrowupunder the shadow of the British name, bordered upon palpable indifference, Hints had for some4iae been brought to this country of the existence of torh in India, but the report of the commissioners estab]ished beyond a doubt that sach was the case. There were, he believed, two causes which had led principaly to such a state of things. One was the tendency to look upon the amount of revenue collected as the main and primary consideration, and the other was the concentration of magisterial and legislative functions in the same persons. The union of such powers even in the hands of men of character and reputation was nt all times an anomaly, and could never be advocated except upon considerations of temporary expediency; but those powers united in thechands of persons unfittedby cducation and traing to exercise either might lead to results of a most serious character. The commnssioners intheir rePOrt stated that if there were one thing more painful than the kcnowledge of the existence of torture, it was the conviction of the dificultyof redress. Now, redress might be difficult, but still it was the paramount duty of this country to provide for security to lifeand prorty in India, for until those advantages were secured to the people no good could be hoped for from that empire, and the longer redress was delay' the more difficult would it become. He begged most earnestly to press upon the Government that they 'were bound upon every principle of policy, of justice, and of religion to sift this matter thoroughly, with the view of providing a remedy for a monstrous eviL Lord WYNTORD stated that his impression was, that a system of turture had not been traced to the British, but to the native officials. After a few words from the Earl of ALBEIARLE in explanation, the motion was agreed to. The Commons Enclosure Bill was read a second time. The Joint-Stock Banks (Scotland) Bill was read a thirdtime and passed, and the House adjourned at 20 minutes past 6 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, Fbiday, Feb. 29. The Speaker took the chair at 4 o'clock. LONDON DIOCESAN CHURCH BUILDING SOCIETY BILL. On the motion for the second reading of this bill, Mr. TTAD-b'IKTiD said, there were several objections to it, and if it were noi allowed to go before the committees upon bills relating to the church now sitting -upstairs, he should move that it be read a second time that day six months. It ought to have been introduced as a publio bill, because it dealt with public propei-fcy. Sir W. CLAY seconded the amendment. Lor R. GROSVENOR said, the bill dealt only with private property raised by voluntary subscriptions, andhe hoped, therefore, thatthe House would assent to the seeond reading. The House divided. The numbers were,For the second reading .........135 Against it ............... 20 Majority ............-115 The bill was accordingly read a second time.

Mr. LAYARD gave notiee that on the next day for going nto Committee of Supply .after this day he should call the attention of the House to the state of our relations with Persia. THE CRIMEAN COMMISSION. Mr; WORTLEY asked the Under-Secretary for Warwheher, in additio*..to the report of Sir J. MNeill and Colonel -_ll<T)ch and the statements animadverting upon that report, sent in by Lord- Cardigan, and Lucnn, a statement had been received by way o£ reply from Colonel Tulloch, and whether t was the intention of the Government to lay that reply upon the table of the house beforo it was sent to the board of general officers? Mr. PEEL said, the replies of Lords Lucan and Cardigan hadbeen sent to Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel 'i-Rochfor their nformation, and a rejoinder had since been received from them, which itwould be far preferable to lay before the board of general officers than before the House. (Heaft) Mr, T. DUNCOMBE asked, whether Sir J. M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch would be permitted to be present during the nquiry, and whether they would have the opportunity of ex_____ig and cross-examining witnesses. Lord PALMERSTON.-As the proceedings of the court will be open, of course Sir J. MNeDl and Colonel TuUoch, ike anybody else, may be present during the inqniry. (A augh].) Mr. DUNCOMBE.-In their official capacity? Lord PALMERSTON.-With regard to their being allowed to put questions to the witnesses, the commissioners will have the f _11 power of governing their own proceedings at their own discretion. Sir D. L. EVANS.-Are we to understand that the hoard may close its doors and become a closed court at its pleasure? Lord PAIMERSTON.-Undoubtedly. (Hear, hear.) The commissioners will have full power to regulate their own proceedings according to their own discretion. (Hear, hear.) THE KINGDOM OF OUDE. On the motion of Mr. Otway, a return was ordered of all sums of money borrowed by the Indian Government, or hy any persons acting under its authority, from the King of Oude, from the year 1811 to the year 1855, showing also what portions (if any) of snch loans have been repaid, and whether such repayments (if any) have been made by money or by cession of territory to the King of Oude, and the dates on which such repayments (if any) were made. SLAVERY IN -TORKEY. Mr. BIGGS asked the First lord of the Treasury whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government, at the present conferences in Paris, to require (in the change3 they mean to advi se in the Turkish ins-tutdons) the abolition of the slave trade and domestie slavery in the Sultan's dominions ? Lord PALMERSTON.-It is well known that Her Majesty's Government have long urged the Turkish Government to put an end to the slave trade which has been carried on from the eastern coast of the Black Sea, and that their representations have been completely successful. With regard to domestio slavery, that is a question, as my hon. friend will see, which does not properly come within the scope of the conference. THE POLICE BILL. In answer to Mr. Deedes, Sir G. GREY said, he could not exactly say whenhe should be able to bring on this bill nntil he saw what progress was made with the war estimates. If no voto were taken to-night, he should not be ableto move the second reading until Monday, and, if the estimates were not all voted on Monday night, he should be obliged to defer it until Friday, or the next open day. THE MILITIA. Mr.EVELyN,inas__ngiheUnder-SecretaiyforWarwhy, for the purpose of being trained and exercised, stated that, though the act of Parliament required that every militia regiment, should be called out once a year for training, yet this regiment had not baen called out since October, 1854. At the same time the staff was maintained at Barnet at great expense to the country. Mr. PEEL said, the practice in regard to calling out disembodied militia regiments was to wait for the application of the lord-lieutenant of the connty to which the regiment belonged, and to leave it to him to name the period when it would be most convenient for the officers and men to be called out for active service.- Eveiy .eeiment, as thehon. gentleman had stated, ought to be called out once a-year, and it was now 16 months since this regiment had been called ont, but during the four months which had passed ance the expiration of the year of d__m_odiment 110 application had been received from the Lord-Ideutenant of Middleser, proposing thatthe reghnent should be embodied. Undoubtedly it would be desirable duiing the "next season that the regiment shonld be called out for training and exercise. Mr. LAYARD thought the conntry was greatly indebted to the hon. member for calling attention to the long period which had elapsed since this regiment had been called out. Just to show what a nice little family party there was in the regimenijhe would read the names of somo ofthe officers. The full colonel was Lord Enfield: the lieutenant-colonel was the hon. member for Tavistock (Jfr. Byng); ___?. Grenfell, one or the nephews and private secretary of Lord Panmure, was a captain; his brother, the hon. memberfor Windsor, was another captain; the hon. member for Bedfordshire (Mr. Russell) was a lieutenant; and his juvenile friend, the hon. and learned member for Devonport (Sir E. Perry), (alaugh) was another lieutenant. This certainly was one. of the greatest jobs which had ever been brought hefore the House. (Hear, hear.) Bef ore sitting down he must complain of the delay which had taken place in presenting some returns for which he moved dunng the last session of Parliament. He moved for those returns with special reference to a motion which he was about to bring before the House as early as the month of May. He repeatedly postponed his motion on receiving a promise that thereturns should be made; but until that very morning he had not received one of those returns. He then received but one-a retnrn of the staff appointments, and he had only ohtained it by continually asking and pressing for it._ Cf course, it was now of no use, so far as the purpose it was originally intended to serve was concerned. Either the Government should say frankly that they wonld not give the returns, or they should give them when theywere asked for. (Hear.) Mr. BYNG said, that no one was more indebted to ihe hon. member for Surrey (Mr. Evelyn) for putting this question than were the officers of the regiment which hadfoimed the subject of the inquiry. Last year statements appeared hi the newspapers containing reflections which, if they had been correct, would have been most discreditable to fhe officers of this regriment. The regiment was out for three consecutive trainings, and he believed that the reports of the inspecting officers were perfectly satisfactory. At all events, the words used by the inspecting ofiicers on parade were satisfactory io the officers and men who were present, and he presumed that their private reports tothe Horse Guards would not differ from the publio expression of their opinions. He could assure the hon. member for Surrey that it was a source of great regret to the officersof the regiment that ii had not its usual 2_ days' training last year. The disembodied staff was perfectly efficient, and he was convinced that whenever the regiment should be called out for training, or should be embodied, both staff and regimental officers would do their best to render its discipline perf ect. In reply to the insinuations that the appointments in this regiment had been made the subject of a family job, he might state that, with the exception of the colonel and lieutenant-colonel, who were certainly related to each other, he did not think that any oiher two ofiicers were at all connected by relationship. (Hear, hear.) It was quite true that Lord Panmure's private secretary was an officer in this regiment; hut he had held his commission in it for two years before he became private secretary to Lord Panmure. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Bedfordshire (Mr. Russell) had held a commission in the army, and also one in another regiment of the militia (hear, hear), and he (Mr. Ryng) did not see why his relationship to another officer should prevent the services of an officer who had served in the? army being most advantageously employed in a militia regiment. He was sorry to have trespassed upon the attention of the House in the matter to which the hon. member for Aylesbury had attempted to give something of a personal character. The hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Evelyn) had made no such attempt, and to him the best thanks of the officers of the regiment were due for the courtesy whioh he had displayed in putting this question, and for the reply which he had elicited." Lord PALMERSTON.-I only want to say a word with respect to the concluding observations of the hon. member for Aylesbury (Mr. Layard), who insinuated that there had been something improper-something like a job-in the selection of the officers of this -fegiment. The hon. gentleman, in making that remark, seems to me to have f oigotten, or to be wholly ignorant of the'nature of, the constitution and the intention of the militia. The militia s a forcer1 composed of men recruited in and belonging to certain counties and districts of counties, to be officered by gentlemen of the neighbourhood. (Hear, hear.) It is a ink between the gentry andthe labouring classes, and is, I think, ofthe highest importance not only to the defence ofthe country, but to that social organization which is so mportant to the best interests of the community. (Hear, hear.)_ So far from its being a reproach that a given regiment is officered mainly by gentlemen connected with toe neighbourhood to which the regiment belongs, such a circuinstance is greatly to the honour of those gentlemen. He_rv hear.) in militia regiments such is generally the case, for I am bonnd to say that the gentlemen of England, of Ireland, and of Scotland have done themselves the greatest honour by the alacrity and publio spirit with which they have devoted themselves ,7ko the militia service, with whichithey have abandoned their peculiar nterests, their private pleasures, and their private occupations for the service of the pubfic ; and, also, by the great efficiency and perfect discipline to which they have brought the regiments to whichthey belong. More than that,officers who have so devoted themselves to the public servioe must naturally take pride in the discipline of their men; but eelings of publio duty havo been paramount to all coniderations even of such honourable pride, and ihey have aken the greatest pains to induoe the men whom they have __k- - --uvuv __-. _<___--v _\ia x-1 bl-UlUlg , _n_ __£.- ed that some provision shouldbe made against theaReiraof. the numoers of militia regiments hy lords-lientrained, and whose discipline they have perfected, to emit their regiments and enlist in those of the line. (Hear hear.) By_t_3S3 sacrifices of privaie considerations and oibpnourablepnde they have contributed greatly to the pubhc service, and have given nearly 24,000 excellently trained and w_l disciplined men to the regular army. (Cheers.) J- Sir E.PERRY explained that his connexion with this regiment had arisen from his having, on his retnrn from the continent, just after the battle of Inkermann, felt that it was the duty of every man who had any leisure to devote himself to the military assistance of his country. (Alaugh.) He himself desired to go to the Crimea. He made known his wish to his hon. friends the First Lord of the Admiralty andthe Secretary of the Treasury, andthe resultwas thathe was placed in this regiment. Mr. G. S. BUCK regretted that the House had received 110 assurance that the Government would communicate with the lord-lieutenant of the exranty as to his having neglected tocall out this regiment for its training; and _u_> gesteafl-L----------.----*--"?>-------^.------_--!_. .. "s tion of ^ tenant. Sir DE LACYJEVANS complained that in the return with respect to staff appointments which had that moming been presented to the House his services on the staff wero not correctly given, while the story ofthose of other officers quite as obscure as himself was elaborately told. He served .upon the staff for three weeks at Chobham and for six weeks in North Britain, and these were given as his part; services. It did happen, however, that he had served upon the staff under the Duie of Wellington and Sir Georga Murray at the engagements in Erance, at Waterloo, and Si America. (Hear.hear.) The battles of other officers were carefully set down, but ins-were overle»ked. If the rest of the return were as destitute of truth as was the statement with reference to himself, it was not worth circulating among members. (Hear, hear.) Major REED said that, from aretum of officers who were honourably mentioned in the course of the Burmese war, for which he moved during thelast session of Parliament, there were omitted the names of tivo officers who had highly distinguished themselves. One of these gentlemea had been twice honourably mentioned in the despatches of General Godwin, had once received the thanks of the Governor-General of India in Council, and had led a storming party, the companies supporting which were led by the other officer whose name was omitted. He did not know whether the fault was at the Horse Guards or at the "Waroffice; hut if returns were granted, ihey ought at least to be accurate. Mr. PEEL observed that the inquiry made by the hon. and gallant member for Westn-inster was of such a naturo ihat it would be difficult to reply to it in a satisfactory manner nnless notice had been given of the intention to ask the question; but if the hon. and gallant member would communicate with him he would endeavour to affordhim all the infonnation possible. With respect to the observations of the hon. and gallant member for Abingdon, he coidd only say that he had asked him-to-mention the officers whose names had been omitted, and, if the hon. and gallant gentteman wonld comply with this request, he (Mr. Peel), -though not concerned in the preparation of the list, would endeavour to have the omissions supplied. - (Hear, Bear.) With regard to the complaint of the non. member for Aylesbury respe-ing the delay alleged to have taken place in the preparation of certain returns, he was notawarethat any avoidable delay had occurred. Hehad a strong impression that allthe returns-moved forby the hon. member hadbeen now presented, andif the fact were otherwisehe would thank the hon. jiiember to particularize the return that was still wanting. rThe hon. member had stated that he required the returns in time for a particular motion, bnt the motion in. question might have been made in a week or ten days afterthe returns were applied for-a space of time quite insuffi-- cient for the compilation of such informaiion as was re-- quired, unless, indeed, the clerks were to be taken fronii their other employments-a proceeding which would occa- - sion mueh inconvenience to the public service. ("Hear,. hear," and a laugh.) Major REED said, he had no objection to mention ia . public the names of the officers to whom allusion had been. . made; theywere those of Major Christie and Captain Welsh, of the 80ih Regiment. _ The motion for the adjournment of the House on its rising _ till Monday was then agreed to. THE REPORT OF THE CRIMEA-. COMJIISSIONFIRS. On the question of supply, Mr. ROEBUCK rose and spoke as follows :-I am not - ?unaware, Sir, of the danger attending the course whierli I aow propose to pursue. At a time when peace and war hang trembling in the balance, it is of the utmost possibleimportance that we should have a Government capable in itself and enjoying and deserving to enjoy the confidence o£ the e-ouniry. Such is the difficuItry before me ; but on the other hand there is this danger, thai, if we were to let pass without comment the proceedings towhich I am aboutto direct the attention of the House, we should do an injury to the army, which is our great defence, paralyze one strfwig- - arm by which we resist aggression from abroad, and render inefficient one salutary means of national safety. (Hear, hear.) Be it understood, then, that I repudiate all responsibility accruing from the motion I am about io submit. If the Govermnent choose to build a wall against which it atthe same timepleasesthemtothrust their heads, Iam not in fault. (Laughter.) I will now proceed to explain the object of my motion. Shortly after our army appeared before Sebastopol there sprang up from day to day whispers of the Bufferings to which that army was exposed, whispers whicii at last deepened, I will not say into a cry, but into a roar of disapprobation expressed hy the whole press of this country. From diy to day and from honr to hour there were told to ns stories which harrowed the feelings of the community with regard to the army in the Crimea; and at last, whenParliameni mei, so alarmed was ihe public mind upon this subject, that the right hon. gentteman the member for South Wilts, who was at that time Secretaiy at War, got up in his place and made a defence - intended to impugn and repudiate aU the stories then current respecting the dangers and disasters to which the army was said to be subjected. There was such a charm inthe right hon. gentleman's manner, something so frank andin- ? genuous in his whole demean onr, that he won theHouse and the country to believe in the statements he made. 1 was myself conscious of the delightful influence. I came down to this house on thai occasion fully impressed with the conviction that our army was'suffering unheard of misery, and I went away with my mind disabused of and disenthralled from the terrible impressions that had been made npon it by the reports which were everywhere prevalent. (Hear, hear.) I believed that the right hon. gentleman had made . out his case-thai the army was not suffering-thatthey had eveiything at command, and thai, in a word, they were as properly cared for as an 'Rnglisb army has a right to be by the authorities of the country. (Hear, hear.) Such, too, was the conviction produced in this house and thronghout the nation hy the speech of" the right hon. gentleman. Bui, shortly after, the same stories of suffering aud misery were reported from day today, the same harrowing descriptions followed, and many days did not elapse before the impression created by the statements of the right hon. gentleman was completely obliterated ; the conntry reverted to its former emotions, and the same anxiety and alarm which distracted the public^ mind before the meeting of Parliament agitated it anewafter the House was adjourned. Imay Bay that this was the end of the first act of the terrible drama of the war in the Crimea. WhenParliament again met, I, though wholly ?unequal to the task, gave notice of my intention to move f orr a crommittee to inquire into the state of thearmy before Sebastopol. Of the effects produced by that notice the House is already aware. Thefirst effect was the utter disappearancefrom the ranks of the Ministay of ihe noble lord the member for London. He, like a timid fisherman who hears a stormcoming on, and sees on the dim horizon a cloud no bigger than his hand, made straight for shore and ran howling inland. (Loud theers and laughter.) Many exceptions were taken to the motion I then made. It was stated-and stated, too, by many hon. and gallant members-that the investigation would do injuryto thearmy; that we were 3,000 miles off; that we could not hear with our own ears nor see with our own eyes that which we desired toinquire into ; and, in a word, it was contended that a committee of this House was a means of inquiry unfittedfor the. case and totally inadequate tc- the occasion. In spite of these statements and in defiance of the dangers prophesied to result from their determination, the Housesupported me in my motion-with what a majority and with what consequences is well known. The first consequence was the ntter disruption of Lord Aberdeen's: luinistry. The danger at that thne was great. We knew itwas. "We were waging a-tenrible war with amost formidable opponent ; yet, notwithstanding the danger that would result from at once dislocating all ihe faculties and functions of the Government, the House gave me its support on that occasion. We did inquire; and what was the result of onr inquiry ? Why, that every statement made bythe press was verified to the very letter (cheers); that every story of misconduct, that every harrowing detail of suffering was proved to the very letter before that committee. (Renewed cheering.) Thus, then, bef ore two tribunals, if' I may so express myself-the press in the first instance-and a cominittee of this House in thesecond, the same result followed-the wretched con-- viction thai our army was melting away (hear, hear)-that we had sent abroad a band of gallant men to fight onr battles, and that they were neglected and left to die of cold, hunger, and disease (hear hear), and that the power of England was inadequate, in the hands of the imbecile authorities who then ruled the State, to take care of her sons whom she had sent to champion her cause. (Loud cheers.) Such was the result of the second inquiry. Bat at this time-at the very time that the House appointed » committee to inquire into the state of the army before Sebastopol, the Government which replaced that of Lord Aberdeen issued a commission to undertake a precisely similar duty. The gentlemen appointed to that office were Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch. Iaminformsd that they were both extremely reluctant to undertake tho task, for they knew that the inquiry they were about to institute would be an ungrateful one, and tbey wm. unwilling to place tbe

London certainly never will be bearable so long as despicable custom holds her sway. The Thames might be ,clean, but it has always been loathsome, and so always ought to be, March is the driest, dustiest month in the year, and not a drop of wvater to refresh one's parched skin and irritated feelings. With the 1st of April come pleasant showers and lumbering water carts. Do have pity on poor Londoners, for from Bayswater to the Bank powdered granite and tritnrated mamire fill the air; and having wandered from west to cast through an atmosphere 'of this kind, one returns at the close of the day beybnd Tyhurn, vainly endeavouring to clear one's throat, and ascertain when " parochial reform"> was born. ; Ian. Sir. vour obedient servant. GASPI1G FOR P RO ATH. Feb. 29.
REPoRTs oF THIE FACoRY InsPEcTORS.-Tlhe reports of the factory inspectors for the year 855 have just been published. The "joint report," dated the 1st ult., statis that much progress has been made, (with the exception of 1,ncashire and the adjoining districts) towards giving effect to those provisions of the statute enacted for preventing bodily injury to the workpeople from mill-gearing in factories. In many parts of the kingdom safeguards of various kinds have been provided to prevent accidents from contact with a revolving horizontal shaft, so that it is difficult to.point out any neighbourhood in whiich, in some or other local factory, very good precautions are not now to be discovered, absolutely depriving of any reasonable excuse for thei* neglect all those who refuse to satisfy the requirements of the act in this respect. The zecent judgmuents of the law courts are referred to as a sufflcient warrant for aUl that:the inspectors have done hitherto, and for their continuing to require the mill-gearing to be securely fenced. The inspectors Presume that as the law has now been settled by three unaunmous judgments of the superior courts, aU those occupiers of factories who have been waiting for such decisions before fencing their horizontal sbafts will now do so by the best means known. The objections urged-against the fencing of such shafts have beei abundantly disuroved by experience. The recommendations and caution issumng from a certain combination of great influence (many-of the parties being themselves magistrates) have produoed a deplorable effect by encouraging a defiance of the law, or, in other words, a resistance of what are called "improper prosecutions." This combination to resist the enactments of the law appenrs to be confined to ,ancashire and the districts borderin oni that county. The rate of increase of new factories and of ladditions to existin' ones was not maintained in 1855, andit isworthy of remari that the proportion of factories closed was less than in 1854. The inspectors especially cal .the attention of the Secretary of State to the provisions for the school attendance ofÃ¯Â¿Â½children emuployed a print works, the attendance having.beenafound to be not, only pract;icaDy a farce, but a mischievous delusion-"asemeblanra of c2ucation without any reality." An amendment of this part of the Print Works- Act is much wanted.- The total number of accidents- reported to the four inspectors during the six months ended the 31st of October, 1i55, amounted to 1,801-viz, 720 to adults, 912 to young persons, and 169 to children. 21 6f these accidents were fataL and alh arote from machinery. There were 72 accidents arising from other causes. 98 informations laid for offences against the 3Factories' Act resulted in 61 convictions. 22 acidents xoso from the nonfencing of horizontal shafts; some of tlhem were very fiightful, involving the knocking out of brains, the tearing off of heads, legs, and anus, and severe fractues of Inmbs.

LO.7DOOLV, SATURDAY, MARCH 1, 156. In the House of Lords yesterday, The Earl of AsrBmsAmi moved for various returns connected with the taxation of the nations of -Ifdia, the means employed to levy it, and the character of the officers of police and revenue, in illustration of the official report recently laid before Parliament on the system of torture used by the Government agents in the IPresideiicy of Madras. To these returns and the report itself, which he recommended the House carefully to peruse, he gave notice that he should hereafter call its more direct attention. It was almost incredible that such a system should have existed for 50 years; that for so long a period the native population of so large a distriCt should I have been subjected to the cruelty of agents, who, acting at once as a police aind collectors of revenue, were often themselves merely associations of thieves. The facts contained in the report had been. rumoured before, but it was only now they were fully ascertained and confirmed. It was the duty of the Legislature to regard with nustrust everything proceeding from the Indian Government, which had always been merciless in its adnnistration. whenever its revenue was concerned. The English Government was also partly responsible, but rather in theory than reality, for the division of powers in the present system practically reduced the responsibility of both to a fiction; otherwise torture could not' have been continually ised for half a century anong 20,000,000 of people. withiout the public in England being aware of it. Earl GiA.NrmE said the returns would cause much trouble, expense, and, delay, as it would be necessary, for certain information, to refer to India; but the Government was so anxious no information shoould be withheld that he should make no objection to the production of the papers asked for. Lord 3IoxNAGiE strongly denounced the system of violence and cruelty revealed by the report; the glory of England was more tarnished by the publication of thus blue-book thani by any occurrence that had taken place since our possession of India; but he aebmowledged that the Government were resolutely taking every means to correct the evil. The Earl of CAPOAnVoNo urged the Government to make a thorough inquiry into the subject. The motion was then agreed to, and the House adjormnedl. Ii the House of Commons, on the question that the House at its rising do adjourn until MIonday, a conversation arose upon a question -put by Mr. ErEavx, why, during the year 1855, the Edmonton Royal Rifle Regiment of Militia (commanded by Lord F:rrsra:) was not called out for the purpose of l;eing trained and exercised. The motion wavs ultimately agreed to. 0:1 the order for goinginto a Committee of Supply, M1r. RoP,BuCE moved, as an amendmient, the following resolution :-" That the appointmenit of a comnnission of general officers to report upon the report of Sir Jou? '117NL and Colonel TunLouH is to substitute an inefficient for a very efficient mode of inquiry; and that the effect of such appointment will be to hide the misconduct of those by whom various departments of our army have been subjected to the command of offices who have been in^ulpated by the comnissioners appointed to inquire into their conduct." In. explaining the object of his maotion, he went through the successive acts of what he termed the terrible drunama to which it referredthe roar of disapprobation raised by the press as to the condition of ourarmy abroad.; the discredit cat uporr the reports by the Government, which affirmed that the army, so far fiom suffering, was properlr cared for; the repetition of the stories of suffering and niscry; the appointment bf the Sebastopol Conunittee, the effect of which was to cause a dist-uption of the AnBsDumN Ministry, while every statement of the press was verified to the velry letter ; the appointment by the succeeding Government of Sir JoBS, B'NEirL and Colonel Tounocn to proceed to the Crimea, who inquired and reported, their report justifying every assertion made by the press. The officers inculpated by this report were the Earl of LucA;., the Earl of C:aPDIGA.V, Sir RICHAiRD AT.y, Colonel GoRDON, and Comimissary-General FmDna. The Government haad now issued a commnission directed to certain *ieneral officers to report on the report of their own commissionefs, ,putting upon their trial the very men they had sent to inquire. By this course he thought they had done an irreparable injury to the anny, wlicih it would be dangerous to possess vith a notion that it was deserted in the hour of need.: If a G4overnment allowed the army to suppose that they were guidedl, with relation to its initerests, by party or selfisl feelings, woe be to them and to England. Sir J. PAxLNGTo-GO;, who had given notice of an amendmident to Mr.: RoEBucK's miotidn, which (that motion. being itself an amendment of a motion) he was precluded fiom moving by the forms of the House, wis'aed -it to be- distinctly understood that this W3as the only reason why he abstained from mo-ting it- The question, then, was whether he shotul11 support the motion before the House; and he 1V3as botmd to say that lie was imable to give his sUppOrt to that motio, towhliehhe entertainedgrave objectiors. It wVas, inl his opinion, open, in a large degrc, to the objectionthsat ittendedtoprejudice a ease that was still pending wvith regard to the officers whose conduct was the subject of. investigation.| vivder these cffcimatanes he ha) decided that his duty was to abstain from entering upon a full discuimion. of these important matters until a future occa.aiou. At the sainu time, he felt bound to state hL- cpinion. that the conduct of the Government in regard to these transactions was open to the gratsVet censure. Sir JoN noticed the extraordinai:y omission to communicate the report of tho comnissioners to the Commander-in-Chief of the army, and, as~ illustrative of 'the general system at work, he -adverted to the particular case I of Commissary-General FnnDEn. He drew a dis'tinction, he said, between the conduct of the GovernTment in givfingappo'eints to the officers in question pending an inqii5ry into their conduct anid tim fact of their promotion;. The Government should' have wvaited the result of the inquiiry ;,but theyhad acted in ail indiscreet manner in maldng these ap-] pointments before theyhad received a report from the commissioners; He uttered not a word to in-, culpate those officers; their compIete exculpation would leave Ihis complainit of the conduct of the Government precisely the same. General PkXL, in reply'to some observations of Mlr. Rozsnucx. g,ave a brief sketch of his own service in the army, and avowed his determination, as a: member of the board of general offlcers, to do everything for the attai nment of justice. Mr. F. PIrr concurred with Sir J. PAx&TOoN in his objection to the motion, and as to the unadvisabilityof prejudginga case that had been remitted to a -ibunal of adiierent character. Hewasnotsurprised, he said, that Mr. RoEBJuc should have brought it forward, since the principle of the course he was then taking was precisely similar to that of his proceeding last year, when, after the report of the Sebastopol Committee had been laid upon the table, he had proposed that every 3nember of the Cabinet at the time when our expeditionary army left this country should be stigmatized and. displaced from public life. On the eve of the meeting of a board of general officers Mr. RonBucx, he observed, submitted a motion which it would be, if not impossible, very difficult to discuss, because a line could not be accurately drawn that. would exclude topics respecting which the Government could not express an opinion. 'He denied that the board was to report upon the report of the co)nmissioners, whose impression was that they were to inquire into the managembnt of the Commissariat, but not into the conduct of any particular officer. Mr. PEEL went largely into-the details of the report of the commissioners and the evidence taken bythem, in order to show that the Government could not adopt the report as conclusive aaainst the officers inculpated, but that it was indispensable that a new tribunal of inquiry should be constituted. He inisted, with reference to the remark of Sir J. PinGO i upon the omission to communicate the report to the Commander-in-Chief, that the course adopted by the Government was, *mder all the circumstances, the most advisable. As to the appointments conferred upon the officers inculpated in the 'report, he stated the grounds upon which they had been made, and he gave explanations respecting the case of Commissary-General FmEB. In conclusion, he left the question in the hands of the House, and had no doubt, he said, that it would refrain from a course that would prejudge the case now before a board of general officers. Mr. BENTiNcx, after indicating the reasons which indisposed him to repose confidence in Mr. RoEBUCm, observed that, under the circumstances of the case, he thought it impossible for the Government to take any other step than the one they had taken; and he was at a loss to understand the grounds upon which Mr. Rosucux had confined himself to a violent attack upon the Goverment, without being prepared to suggest any remedy. Mr. LAYARD commented upon what he termed the extiaordinary and indiscreet speech of Mr. F. PErn. He insisted that by the very terms of the warrant. the board was to report upon the report of the commissioners; it was, therefore, virtually an appeal by the Government from their own sentence. He objected to the Board of Inquiry, because it was impossible, for the reasons he stated, that there could be a fair trial; because it was a clumsy mode of carrying out the intentions of the Government ; because no oath was imposed upon the members of the board, or upon those who came before it; and because it was an implied censure of the commissioners. Re read opinions expressed by high authorities condemnatory of a similar tribunal-the Board of Inquiry into the Convention of Cintra; and he urged upon the House that when the moment came for taking up the whole of this inquiry it must act up to its duty to the army. Colonel NORTI defended the young officers of the army ag,ainst remarks by Mr. LA Yu which, in his apprehension, cast obloquy upon them. Re complained of the injury done to the officers inculpated in the commissioners' report by its being circulated -without the antidote to its poison. Sir DE LACY EvANs condemned the speech of iMr. F. Psu, who, he observed, had not adopted the course suggested by Sir J. PANGTox, but had chaUenged the opinion of the Rouse upon the whole question, casting his accusations right and left, indulging in an inprovoked accusation of him (Sir DE LACE) and other generals of division, upon the evidence of Colonel GoRDON. Re protested against anytlhing like secrecy in the impending inquiry, every part or which must, he said, be above-board. Ho complained, howrever, that there were facts connected withthe report, relating to the sanitary condition of the army, which the Government withheld, being fearful to disclosethem, ubut which were necessary to prove conduct or misconduct. As an evidence of want of accuracy, as well as of judgment, on the part of Colonel GoRDoN, he related a transaction inthe Ciimea in which those deficiencies might have compromised the division which he (Sir ]DE LACY) commanded. He gave other details, some of an amusing character, concerning " poor General SD,irsO," the electric telegraph, and the Turkish Contingent; and he contended that the improved condition of the army, for which Lord PANTanIE, he said, assumed credit, was duie to the commissioners, Sir J. M'Nma and Colonel TuT.oCE, whom Mr. PEEL had been instructed to depreciate and disparage. Their report, and the evidence they had taken, would remain on record as a menace to incompetency, a warning to Governments, and a guide to the commissariats of other armies, and perhaps other ages. Mr. GOrwo)N said he had listened with some surprise and some pain to the remarks of Sir DE LACY EwsT upon his gallant relative (Colonel GORDON), who would be likewvise surprised .at the altered opinions of Sir DE . LACY regarding him. He quoted a letter of Sir JoSh M'NELL, commending the candour and care of Colonel Gor.nON, and with that opinion in his favour he hoped he did not say too ^much fwhen he said that it outweighed that' of Sir DE LACT EVAsS. As to the charge of a misconception of orders, he observed that it should not have been made against a person not a member of the House without some notice, and; if well founded, it should havebeeninvestigated at the time. MIr. GLADSTONE could not help expressing a sentiment, in which he believed mnany shared, of regret at thelatitude g,ivento this debate, consequent upon the speech of Mr. :PEEL. He was sorry that the Rouse should be called upon- to give an opinion uponthie conduct of the Crimean comrmissioners. W7hatever might be the terms of: the notices of motion, he concluded that the Government would give no colour to thecharge that the board of general officersawas to revise the report of the commissioners; but the Royal - warrant authorized. the .board to inquire into the statements contained in that report and into the Levidence' upon which it was founded; and, although Mr. ROEBUCKi had challenged the Government to say whether they were going to try the report of the committee, no answer had been given to the challenge. Who the officers to be tried were was not known. But the most important point was the, position in which the commissioners were to stand before the board. They had not been appointed to try the conduct of any officers,-so that the terms of the motion involved a clear error; tbey were ordered to collect facts and to suggest remedies. Yr. PEES had intimated that there werepoints in the report whichrequiredrectification; but the facts were, in the main, true, and the commissioners ought not to be brought like criminals before the board.0 He hoped the precedent of the Convention of Cintra Board would be followed, and that the present board wrrould not have to try facts collected upon the spot, but only to ascertain' 'the military responsibility of officers whose conduct was indirectly impugned by the comnmissioners. - DEtio W =so. spoke in opposition to the motioai. Lord PAL.lEiisToN observed that the course-of thie aeb~ atmulst ha-e shown to Mr. RozBuCo that he had not exercised a' sound discretion in choosing that moment for making it. - He justified the coursetaken byMr. PEED, and censured the personalities in wlhich Sir DE LAGY EVANS, he said, had indulged, attacking officers high and low-a proceeding inconsistent wAith his generous character. It had been said that the appointment of the Board of General Officers was a reflection uponx the commissioners rent to' the Crimea; buit their proceedings h&dbeen entirely satisfactory to the Government, as well as to the advantage,of the -service, and the result had been that, from the time they had put matters to rights, the army had been extremelywell supplied. - The Govermnent were much obliged to those gentlemen, and there was nothing in the appointmnent of the Board which implied the slightest reflection upon their proceedings. But the state of the case- wasthis :-the report of -the commi84 sioners contained statements which several offi-l cers considered cast a reflection upon their conduct, some inquiry was due to their character, and what better opportunity could there be for such an inquirythan was afforded by the appointment of a; Board oof General Officers ? The Board was not to report upon th.e report of the commissioners, but to inquire into those matters which certain officers con-. sidered cast a reflection upon their conduct, to re-. ceive explauations, and to .report thereupon. Ee' vindicated the appointim6nts df the officers impugned' in the report, and, in t7bniclusion, pronounced the motion neither well-timed nor just. If itwas intended to censure the Government, he said, the censure was not deserved, and, so farfrom its being intended to try the report of the commissioners, the Government attached the highest value to that report and to the result of their labours. Lord LovArNm inqured wlether the relatives of: Lord RAGLAw would be allowed to attend the board and tender evidence, shouldc it be necessary, on his 'behalf ? Lord PAriNynsToN replied that the Court would afford every opportunity to the relatives of Lord, RAerL&iY to vindicate his memory, should anything pass which they miglht think at all reflected upon it. Lord C. HA=ToNx, with much warmth, defended his relative, Colonel GoRDaO, against the strictures of Sir DE LAcY EVANS. After explanations from Sir Ds LAcy and Mr. PEEL, Mr. RoFsxvcxwithdrew his motion, and the House went into a Committee of Supply upon the Army Estimates, wwhen a vote towards the charge of the land forces was agreed to. Several bills were advanced a stage, and, the other business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at 10 minutes past 12 o'clock.
To those who rather require the healthy excitement of war nothing can be more consolatory than the present tone of the Commons. WVe may depend on it, that though the fighting may cease on the banks of the Tchernaya, it will continue to rage on those of the Thames; and, though the Conferences at Paris may come to an early and pacific conclusion, not so the debates in the British House of Commons. Everything is done here to expand the difficulty into an infinite series. At the first teirible burst of the Crimean tragedy public indignation became absolutely insurgent, broko through the guard of office, and overthrew, split asunder, aud cowed successive Administrations, till a solemn inquisition was held on the causes of oiir disasters. Mr. RoBBuCE very correctly describes himself as the pronuent figure in the insurrectionary rush which extorted this act of justice. From that day to this he has been, as we say, at the head of the movement, the foaming crest of the ever advancing surge; sometimes noisy, sometimes menacing rather than powerful, but always strong in his cause. Uncontrollable and illadvised as he may occasionally have been, we cannot but regard him as tle impersonation of a sound instinct and a righteous quarrel. Against this sudden inundation of wrath the present Govermment has been continually employed in erecting successive barriers and breakwaters. At one time it was content to break the force of the current, then to turn it aside, and now it even aspires to hurl it back altogether. - Compelled to grant a Commnittee of Inquiry, it reluctantly allowed it to be open. It then sent out its own Commissioners to the Crimea, with what precise object it never explained; for, judging by the result, it did not expect them to make any considerable discoveries. The Select Committee being in independent hands, the Commission was at least a weapon which could be used or not, as the case might require. As it happened, the Commissioners did their duty, and their report was kept for seven months in the desk of the War Mlinister. Had they fulfilled the just fears and natural suspicions, which Mr. F. PEEL thinks so great a blot in Mr. Ronnuxces course of action,-had they closed their eyes to what they saw, and their ears to what they were told on every side,-had they then and there whitewashed the whole administration of the army in the East, we are of opinion that not a day, not a minute, would have been lost in bringing tho document to the light. In the mystery which so long enveloped it, a'ad in that long delay of seven months, we now possess a measure of the importance which the M1inisters attached to it. A Commission whose report could thus be used or not, and which could be kept in store for any period whatever, was a very convenient instrument. Wre now see that nothing was intended but a " buffer," to use a term of the rail, against popular collision. The men chosen, however, were too honest, and the device failed. Had the British public been content to ask no questions the report would never have been heard of, or exhumed only for the benefit of some unborn MACAuLAY. But some rumours of its contents, and the outrage done to public feeling by selecting the worst offenders for honour and responsibility, revived the feelings that Government had so much reason to fear. What was then to be done ? With a singular vant of invention, with a persistence in the old course that argued rather weakness than audacity, Government could think of nothing to cover the old Commission but a new one. Like the ships we were lately sending one after another to the Arctic Seas, a Commission was to be despatched after a Commission, and a report laid on a report, how far and to how many successive layers of inquiry time alone could show. This was what Mr. RozEBucx had to expose last night, and what Government had to defend as well as it could. The choice of the new Commcission was too much in accordance with its evident object to be passed over, and Mr. RoEBuosx defied the charge of personality. No doubt if, as is believed, everybody concerned in the Crimean mismanagement is to be let off easy, and the approaching peace is to be celebrated with a gaol delivery of Generals and Staff officers, excepting perhaps some,poor scapegoat of a Commissary, never was a Board so adroitly composed. We don't insist much on its veteran character nor the leaning already shown; but we should be surprised to find any other result than nobody in the wrong, nothing proved against anybody, misfortunes beyond human foresight or estimate, no remedy possible, and nobody to be censured, excepting, may be, the unfortunate Commissary-General,- paid to be beaten in the place of his betters. But there is no longer any disguise over the purpose of the-Commission. It is nothing more than, a Peace Conference in London to settle the differences of General offlicers and enable them to offer mutual explanations. A body of gentlemen eminently qualified to officiate in such affairs will receive conflicting statements, and find out how. they may be reconciled without much loss of meaning or of honour. If one man declared he received letters, and others decLared they never wrote them, as Mr. F. PEEL very pleasantly con-, fesed to be the case, then the Boad will discover that everybody did his duty, though in effect inothing was done. It was, of course, an anachronism to promote the subjects of inquiry before their final expurgation, but that was unavoidable. In a certain place, the poet tells us, the judge Ecourged first and heard afterwards; but in that more genial court over which Lord PMAMtuRE pre- sides they reward frst and try afterwards.- The taccused come into court with their blushingoihonours thick upon them. Under these circumstances the Bench niust be well selected, and the tlial conducted with uncommon discretion.- The purifying process is singularly delicate, and the Board must be left alone or the work will be all spilt. Mr, RoEBUCK heedlessly rushes in to see the interesting experiment which is to develope into heroes men s.o mortal and even ,ulgar in their errors. When O-Ex,' as schoolboys read, was holding her adopted son over the live coals, to purify him into godhead, the boy's mother peeped in -and spoilt the process by her impatient curiosity. That is precisely Mr. Ro=ieBug offence in the. eyes of, Lord PA=srssTox and the UNDm-SEcsETrAy for W&. If he will only let the Board alone, it will soon present us with half-a-dozen great soldiers in- stead of that number of very ordinary bumglers.l In that case England will indeed have reason to rem9mber with thaulifulness that, if the army perished, the generals survive; and, in the event of another war, we know where to go for generals. "'Tis not in mortals to command success,"- and they did not succeed in preser'ving their army, I but they did more-they deserved to do so.
A few years since a phrase in an American President's Message was received with no little censure aud ridicule. In alluding to a much questioned institution of the Southern States he avoided the term "slavery" and spoke of "invo" luntary servitude." It was indignantly asked if a change of names could disguise a reality-if the evil which philanthropists had for a century denounced could be palliated by any euphemistic language ? We are entitled to demand the same discrimination when the converse error appears. If it be absurd to disguise an inhuman bondage under a new name, it is unjust to inveigh against a social institution because the word by which our language expresses it suggests ideas of horror and cruelty. Mr. BIGGs has made himself the representative of those who are led away by excusable, though by no means harmless, delusion. He asks the FIRST LORD of the TREASURJY "whether it is the intention of "MER MATAsrys Government at the present "Conferences at Paris to require (in the changes "they mean to advise in the Turkish institutions) "the abolition of the slave trade and domestic I "slavery in the SuiTT's dominions." Thus, in addition to the settlement of the Danubian Principalities, the recognition of equality between Rayah and Mussulman, the permission of Euopeans to possess property, and several other most difficult matters, this gentleman would have the British Government interfere to subvert a domestic system which has existed in the East from the days of ABRAH-2, and would make the adoption of such a change by the SuLTAx one of the conditions of any treaty of peace. There must prevail in the hon. member's miind a most incorrect notion of the -whole subject, if he thinks either that there is a monstrous evil to be remedied or that the remedy can be fitly applied by the statesmen who are negotiating at Paris. With respect to Turkish slavery, it is easy to convince those who will allow themselves to listen. There is, no doubt, a large body who most justly conceive that the subordination of one human being to the will of another is a moral evil, and that a society free from such an usage has much to be thankful for. It is also natural that the great mass of English people, when they hear the word " slavery," should picture to themselves incidents the most horrible and degrading. The American cotton-grower, with his fit "hard with knocking " down niggers," and the hon. member of Council in a West India island who kept his offending valet in a dark vault for a twelvemonth, are among the tales with which the fancy of the present, generation has been nourished. We have all read of the "middle passage," of Gold Coast kings making war for the sake of catching men to sel to Brazilian and Yankee skippers, and even, not so many years ago, to the traders of pious Liverpool. We have stories of negro dealers and negro hunters, of bloodhounds and Judge LyycEr, and in our horror atthe name ofslavery we confound the institutions and practices of countries the most widely different. The slavery of Turkey is entirely domestic, and resembles in no way the enforced field labour of the, United States or Brazil. It is limited by the small supply which can be obtained from two uncivilized and far from populous regions. The white slaves are mostly brought from the Cireassian coast, the negroes are from the depth of Nubia, or from those unexplored lands which lie' south of Tripoli and Tunis. .Without the aid of Western- philanthropists the white slave trade has greatly diminished. Georgia, from which half a century since hundreds of a fne population were yearly brought, is now under the, dominion of Russia. Mingreia and Imeritia are similarly withdrawn from the traffic. The Circassian coast still supplies a large numnber of girls for the Constantinople market. The nature of this trade has been often described :-Some girls are sold at an early age to be educated in Stamboul; others, more-advanced in years, are taken for domestic service. It is well known. that the young ladies who possess personal charms look upon the abandonment of their country as no misfortune. They become the wives of wealthy Turks, and the mothers of Pashas and even Sultans. ABDuL MEDJID himself is the son of a slave who was the daughter of a Georgian priest. As for the great body of the women, they become often the wives of tho purchaser, and in all cases form part of a. household where their chief grievance can be but the ill-temper of an irritable mnistress. The men have in every age risen to the highest ranks in the State, often by no worthy means, it is true ; but yet with speed and certainty the clever slave becomes the confidant and deputy of his master, and is finally advanced to some public post. MVinisters who meet the European representatives on equal terms, who have received the visits of Western Royalty, who have defied the threats of Russian diplomacy, have been Circassian slaves. The bondsman of. the East is a Mussulman, and therefore one of the ruling caste. If even he remain the property of his master, he may, if that. master be great, become great . himself. It is useless, therefore, to draw any comparison between the slave of a Turkish household and the beast of burden to which the negro is degraded on an Alabama plantation. A man who may lise to command the armies of an empire; to own large tracts of country, to build his palaces and lay out his pleasuregrounds, to be proud of his horses, snd famous for the splendour of his diamonds, does not belong to the class of which Uncle ToSE is, to our countrymen, the ideal type. Even the coal-black Nubian has little to complain of -when he once arrives within the precincts of a Turkish city. The overland traffic between the inner desert and Tripoli is indeed said to be fraught with horrors, and the. track of the caravans is described as whitened with the bones of many gererations. Of course, when water falls short the slaves are the first. to be sacrificed, for even the bea"ts are necessary to the master's safety But this is the very evil which woulcd nob be prevented by the interference. of the Western Powers. The slive trade would still be continued to supply the African cities. The additional hardships suffered by those brought on to the capital are small. When engaged in actual domestic service their lot is . easy one. T hey are protected b; law, by the fes n ' Of co0 mon rligion, and by a aind of puby lc ;~~on which blames severely any Qn.d of public opi,-" w wanton' cruelty.

Public feelia in Cirtasix ' s,id to be decidedly against ij%- and Stjnboul oily I waits for the disappearance of the Chaours t, renews the traffic, which is satisfactory alike to the merchant, the purchaser and the oject of sale. The importatioR of Nubians wbe are brought up in the Mussulman faith is almost a necessity where the Turldsh population is small, - since the admission of Christians to a Mussulman house is distasteful to all concerned, and incompatible with many usages. It will, we believe, be persisted in, whatever be the' assurances received by Western diplomatists. We would therefore, while giving full assent to -all the theoretical maxims of Oriental abolitionists, sincerely advise our countrymen to meddle no more in such a question. We have quite enough on hand. Even in this country we mnow that to obtain an act of Parliament is not enough for the completion of a reform. There is afterwards the worlking,. with its failures, its experiences, and its surpiises. Surely the abrogation of a policy 1,200 years old, by placing the MIussulman on a level with the Rayah, is suflicient. at preselit for the most enthusiastic philanthropist. Let us see if 'we cani really carry out this, and, if we succeed, it will be time enough to attaclk an institution coeval with the'world's oldest records, and incorporated with the daily, life, the religion, and almost the nature of the Oriental. 'We must recollect that Turkey is not a conquered countrythe SuLTA? not a despotic Sovereign. He is the Monarch of 15,000,000 of his coreligionists, whom he governs according to laws which, whatever their defects, have yet the power to limit his authority. If the Western Powers carry too far 'their demands they will do an injustice to ABDuL MnInDn by trenching on his independence; they will cause him to promise 'what he cannot enforce, and the result will be that the mnoderate changes which are now probable wil be impeded by the alarm felt on all sides at edicts 'which would overthrow the whole social fabric of the East.
A very strenuous attempt was made on Thuasday night by Mr. J. P ORiamoiE to convert the House of Commons into a Court of Appeal from a decision of five of the Irish judges. Mr. P1r=oRE appears to- have been misinformed upon his facts, and to have really believed that he was bringing a case under the notice of the House which was characterized by singular injustice. As impartial spectators or bystanders, after listening to his statements and to Mr. WHrIEsiD's reply, we cannot say that, except in the peculiar horror and abominable character of the details, we find anything in the case of " TALBOT v. TALBoT" which requires or justifies so extraordinary a measure as an appeal to the House of Commons. As was very properly remarked in the course of the discussion, the corruption of a judge constitutes a sound reason for an appeal from his decision to the House of Commons; but this ground of argument was given up by Mr. J. PnIriroiPn at the very outset of his statement.- He relied upon the incapacity of MIr. Justice Tonamss, and he argaed the incapacity from his decision in this case. But how stand the facts? Mr. Justice Torumes was the mouthpiece of the Court of Delegates. Five judges, of whom he was one, tried the case, and in delivering the judgment he delivered not only his own conclusions, but the conclusions of his four assessors. How is it, when the offence comes from five, that the attack is made upon one ? It is, of course, within the experience of all persons who have been so unfortunate as to be concerned in melancholy transactions of this kind that they are invariably characterized by a fealful amount of cross-swearing. One side or the other is discontented with the decision. Statements -which were set aside by counter-statements, and points of evidence which were rejected as unworthy of belief, are repeated as though they had never been answered or discredited, and the result is, that the side which was worsted at the trial claims a reversal of the decision upon a mere repetition of its own allegations. The chief point at issue in the present case was this *--ad or had not Ms. TAiBOT been guilty of adultery with a groom in her husband's employment at a particular time in a room over the stable ? There were, of course, various other points raised in the course of the discussion, and it shall be our endeavour, in as few words as possible, to give a general idea of the statements on either -side; but the case is remarkable rather for its tragical resullt, and because it has been made the subject of an appeal to the House of Commons, than from any unusual complication of evidence. At any rate, there lies an appeal to the Upper House, and surely Mr. PnnroRE migght have awaited the result of that obvious remedy, if there is a failure or miscarriage of justice, before venturing upon the extraordinary course of an appeal to the House of Commons from the sentence of five judges. Mlr. and Ms. TALBOT were married in the year 1846. At first they resided in the county of Cork, but afterwards in the county of Roscommon. Until the month of MIay, 1852, Mr. TAnoT believed his wife to be pure and spotless. On the 19th of that month Mr. TALBOT, whose suspicions had been aroused a few days before by the report of his servants, broke into a room over the stables, in which were found Mrs. TALBoT her daughter, a little girl of about seven years of age, and the groom. Mr. J. PnmrioiE greatly relied upon the fact that the child was in the room, and complained that MIr. Justice ToRBras had omitted all mention of the child's presence. Mr. TABOT took away his daughter, and quitted his house, leaving hiis wife in the charge of hvo men, one of whom the same night attempted to violate her, and this ruffian was the same man who had first informed, against the -wretched lady. The same night MIrs. T-inoT went to Dublin, and by the time she arrived there she was raving mad. Wlhile she was in this &ondition her husband's solicitor took her proxy that he might employ a proctor to defend her against her husband's charge. Mfr. TAIBOT, in the conduct of his case, relied mainly upon the evidence, of two witnesses, and of a clergyman who had received what the husband's advisers chose, to consider as the lady's confession of her guilt. N!Tow, of these two witnesses one was the ruffian who had attempted the violation of M rs. TiiALoT; the other was a maid servant, who averred throughout her belief in the innocence of her.- mistress, and alleged that she had been tampered with by the other side to induce her to give false testimony. The clergyman's statement, amounted to this-he had taxed Mns. TAnor with her guilt, and she had not denied it; theiefore it I was argued she was guilty. . It was moreover alleged that previously to the removal of the family from Cork to Roscommon other acts of adultel-. had taken place, of which 31r. TALBOT was entirely. ignorant until after the explosion in May, 1852, but Mlr. Justice ToRPNss, as MIr. J. PnImt6aoi argued, had entirely omitted to mention that on the other side a female servant was produced who had been constantly in attendance upon her mistress, and who- must have been cognizant of the guilty acts, had such occurred. This witness swore. 5trongiy in favour of Mrs. TAiuoT S entire innocence. -The end of this shocking o-' is sad enough, if we understand M1r. P- 3 o,Y words aright. MIrs.

FM- Bet there is "r convers,atfan, no joyful sympathy of tried "fii 04 no voice of children, no fathers chrefie "C o= -nothing but complete oblivion auin " endless darkness;" All this is, melancholy enough, ob~ whichever side right may lie; but,; having stated tihis case in MIr. J. PImtroLfdE'S manner, it is wvw tbme to turn to the answer given by his oppwents through the mouth of MIr. WHrESDE. It appears that when Mr. TALBOT, w.ho had. been moved to suspicion by his butler, ran lip tr the roomu of MuLl, the groom, he was refured admittance. The door was broken open, and M,rs. TxABoT was found behind the curtains of the bed. A female witness, 2'VLA Moov, swore that upon another occasion she saw the parties in a situation which could leave no doubt as to their giit. Another witness, whose evidence, accord- ing to Mr. WHITESiDE, was unimpeached, stated X that she had constantly seen MIrs. TSALOT go into the room of the groom. A carpenter confirmed this statement, and swore that through the window he had seen-Mrs. TAlBOT and the groom together in the room in question. In point of fast, it waS sWorn by many witnesses that Mrs. TALBOT Was in the habit of going constantly into the apartment of this luan, W=IAm-r MuIU-q, and that this apart, ment was over a stable in the garden. It wouldc require more space than we can afford to devote to, the purpose to rectify Air. ArCLmmAsm's evidence, according to Mr. WmArrsim's views. Here is the gist of it-we are quoting, of course, from MIr. WMmsrieD'S speech,-" This lady had several " times said, ' I am guilty, and have brought sor"C Crow and shame upon my father and mother;' "and when she was asked whether she had been "provoked to commit the crime by the misconduct "of her hiusband, she answered, 'Never.'" Mr. 3?CLrLLA,D is the second interlocutor in this brief dialogue. We are bound to state, after a most careful review of the allegations on either side, that we never met with a case which called less for any extraordinary interference. It appears, on the contrary, that the decision of the Court of Delegates was quite borne out by the evidence,. that Mr. Justice TonamNs, as the mouthpiece of the Court, is not obnoxious to the charges brought against him by Mr. PnRrinronE, and that, if therehas be-en niscarriage of justice, Mrs. T[Auoes case may -with perfect propriety be left to the usual tribunals for appeaL

Tss Bu1tmG oF Co];x IN RooMs.-On the 22d of Febrnary an accident which was nearly attended with fatal consequences occurred at Belchamp Hall, Walter Belchaznp, the seat of 3fr. S. ;M Rayrond. It appears that after the family retired to bed the previous night two of the maid-servants filled a large iron pail with heated coke, and imprmdently ced it in their bedroom. About 7 o'clock next morning Mr. Oliver Raymond, of the Stock-Exchange, who was maling a short stay at the hall was suddenly awakened by his father, who said he feared something dreadful had happened upstairs, asviolentshrieks were heard from the room where the two servants slept. In a fewmoments he was there, and a dreadfu spectacle presented itse]. There lay the poor victuns of their own thoughtlessness, their faces.a purply black, their eyes set, their hands clinched, their limbs cold, rigid, and to all a pearanoe lifeless. The mother of one of the sufferere, whohad been to call them, and who had attered the screams, was standing over the inanimate form of her child, stunned at the sight. Dr. Lynch, of Sudbury, was instantly sent for, and the hour that elapsed before his -arrival was most judiciously spent by Mr. 0. Raymond, who at length contnved to forcetheir months open by inserting the handle of a spooni between the teeth, and thus managed to get a little cold vater in, and at last, by the dint ot riction, hot water to tlhir feet, and strorg restoratives, succeeded in briDging back the vital spark, which had well-nigh gone for ever. On the arrival of the medical man it is needle.s to add that they rceived every attention, and there is every probability of their speedy recovery. It is extraordinary, after so many aimilar cases have occurred from ignorance of the foarful effects of burning coke or charcoal in a bedroom at night, when the vindows are all closed and the chimney often stopped up, that we have to record a fresh instance. The result shows that the knowledge of such facts as tima above ought to be among the "common things" taught iR. our national naidkothe. scho.-Ch#msfor4 (hvnck.

FRANCE. We have received the following telegrapiac dert&h from our Paris correspondent:- "PARIS, SATURDAY, 8 A.3. "The Mo.niteur announces that on Monday, the d of M&arch, the Emperor will open the Legislative session of 1856 at the Tuileries." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the Ietter of our Paris corresndent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.:- A private letter from Stockholm, of the 19th, reteived here yesterday, mentions that the Russians sere sending troops in considerable numbers to Fialand, concentrating a large force round St. Petersburg, and strengthening the barriers I have s1ready mentioned near Cronstadt, so as to comIlEWy close up the entrance. With the feeling against Siveden there would be nothing extraordinIry-in the fact of Russia gratifying her spite by aiarnitlg that Power, though, under actual circumaiances, there can be no apprehepsion of attacking her. Such warlike preparations going on so close to Bweden will necessarily require corresponding precautions onherpart, and ifRussiacannot declare war sgainsther she will do all she can to exhaust her resources by compelling hertoadoptexiraordinarymeawireaofsacurity. We hear it constantlysaid byRussians, and the partisans of Russia here, that peace is Cercain,-that the Czar is determined on making eveLy coneession,-and that, in fact, there cannot lie a dou'ot as to the pacific issue of the Conferences. If suen be realy the case-if all the chances are for peace, anid not one for war, how is it that the Lovernment of St. Petersburg continues to spend m illions in massing large bodies of troops m those places which in the (I admit) improbable event of a rupturewouldprobablybethe newbattle ground. We are assured oyRussians, andbyFranco-Russians, that Ilhecharacter of theRussian Government andtheRussian people has undergoneamarvellous change within a very slhort time; that no people have acquired so zujden a yearning for peace, and for the works of peace, that the very word " war" inspires as inlch horror in the breast of everytrue Russ as it does in that of the moat self-denying member of the Peace Congress. It is to be hoped that the conversion-is real, but it nevertheless accords ill with the facL3 I mention. Such sudden conversions are at all tuies suspicious. Ia the diffculty of obtaining authentic informat on of what really passes at the Congress, the verz.ons given out of doors will necessarily be received wi:H caution. In spite of the secrecy with which the proceedings are carried on, something howvever DocasionaUly transpires which serves to indicate more Dr leas the turn affairs are taking. With refeience to the first day's meeting it- is again afirmed that among other things a discussion took-place on the rectification of the Ottoman territory as comprised in the Austrian conditions accepted by Russia. Count Orloff, we are told, expreased a desire to make a few observations, tending to show that M. Buol, if he was the Minister Who drew them up, was completely unacquainted pith 'the topography of the place. With the maD keforehimn, he pointed out that the moumtainous u iLain. which was to be substituted for the Pruth as tile new frontier of Wloldavia, had hardly any exisLence except in the imagination of the Vienna Cabinet. That the mamelons, which would be a good !rontier, only protected the Austrian territory, but lat from it to the sea there was nothing but plain. ife said that the Czar having accepted the four points, there was no intention of violating the word of His Majesty, but that he was anxious to show 5svth what want of reflection the condition fixing a tLewboundaryhad been drawnup. M. de Buol defended his project as best he could, and was asnwered by M. Brunow, who, in a still longer speech, completed what his colleague had begun. Again, with reference to the armistice, it was red-according to the same version-on behalf of the alles who-are belligerents that it must not exdlude the faculty of transporting troops and military stores from one point of the seat of operations to another. To this Count Orlolf is said to have formnally objected. An armistice meant a suspension of hostilities and a situation which shall continue Ihe same from the beginning till the conclusion of the truce. The English, for instance, are complete nasters of the sea, on which no Russian flag can aplpear; hey have an enormous fleet, and may at any time transport 50,000 men from the Crimea to the T altic, and that consequently the advantages would be on one side, and all the disadvantages of immobility on the other. And he finished by urging that the conditions of an armistice could hardly be such as these. Again, we are told that the Ottoman PlenipotenV.-ary objeeted to the proposition of new institutions, favoured by England, for the Danubian PrincipaliJies, and to their union under one authority. This resion I by no means vouch for, and I mention it rather because I find it pretty nearly the Same in different quarters, than from any implicit ]belief on my part in its complete accuracy. I am ware that by some it is denied; but those from whom the denial most emphaticaly proceeds are the game who declare that everything is going on most satisfactorily and smoothly, so much so, indeed, that vne would suppose the Russians seem only anxious ito anticipate what is demanded of them in order to pat it, and that the Conferences will reach, their termination without the slightest dissension, and this 1 know to b untrue. The :Cogr did not meet to-day. It met 1yesterda&,:J1wever, and though nothing positive Eeemns toi transpired, yet I have some reason to lelieve tia it was something Lke what I indicated ,yester on the fifth point, and of a grave, not to vey cotentious, character. Some people pro. rzoqu,e6the word 'storin'," but this is going too far. ,V.eshall attain, no doubti the object we have in v-ew; but I thinkl not without some struggle. The Russians themselves are, as I have said, confdent of a pacHficsohtiobn,`and the Plenipotentiaries themselves do not-discourage the hope. I believe lie Russian; will consent after some show of resisttsice to everything demanded of them, with the exception of the demolition by their own hands of :Ticholaieffj which however they will change into a c=xmnercial port if required, and that of their ships. :Neither wil they reftuse to admit the Consuls of :Foreign Powers. All that is said on the subject mlust be recLved with great cauition. The interval which elapsed between the first and ccjand s.tting of the Peace Congress was employed not only in preparing and copying the minutes of the first meeting, but in deciding on the wording of the convention of armiistice, which was to be signed in as manycopies as there are contracting Powers. I Count Orloff and the Grand Vizier Aih Pasha dined yesterday 'with the Emperor and Empress. After dinner their Majesties conducted their guests to the Gallerie de Diane, and assisted at a theatrical performance. The company subsequently removed to the supper room, where the Emperor and Count Orloff remained in close conversation during half an hour. An Imperial decree opens to the Minister of State on the estimates of 1856, a supplementary credit of 2,000,0QOf. applicable to the works of the New Louvre. Countess de Montijo, mother of the Empress of the French, arrived at Bayonne on the 27th ult., from Madrid, and left the next day for Paris. The stage coach plying between Pau and Dax ws upset, on Monday last, within half a mile of Orthez. The carriage was literally smashed to pieces. M. Patrick O'Quin, who was coming to Paris to take his seat in the Legislative Body, and occupied the cotup6 with his wife, was dangerously wounded. He was conveyed to Orthez by M1. Lapeyra, who happened to pass by in his cabriolet at the moment the accident occurred. M. O'Quin's state caused some uneasiness. Madame O'Quin had some severe icontusions. An English gentleman, and the sub-Prefect of Orthez, who were outside passengers, were thrown to a great distance, but escaped with only a few bruises. The receipts of the Orleans Railway, during the week ending on the 18th ult., were 875,641f., or 241,487f. more than during the corresponding week of 1855. The gross receipts, since the 1st of January, amounted to 5,931,820f., being a difference in favour of 1850 of 866,218f.

Your Paris correspondent is every now and then able-to give you valuable hints concerning what is passing in Vienna, and it is possible that during the Conferences some little information relative to them may reach you from this city. A day or two before the first Conference was held, the Earl of Clarendon, Count Buol, and Count Walewski had a prolonged interview, during which the Austrian Minister had occasion to remark that the understanding between the representatives of the Western Powers " was perfect." Neither the 'British nor the French Minister displayed any desire to slake exaggerated demands on Ruissia; but they gave Count Buol to understand that they had already agreed on the interpretation to be given to the fifth point.- Now, reliable information has been given me that Count Buol has received positive instruietions " to hold firmly to France," and therefore a hollow peace is not likely to be concluded, if the Western Powers are faithful to each other. The Franifor't Post Zefieng has learned from an "authentic " source, that RPussia will even consent to sacrifice Wicholajeff for the sake of peace, but unfortunately the intelligence received by the German paper does not agree with reliable information which has reached this city. If hard pushed by the Western Powers and Austria, the Russian Government may perhaps consent to permit consuls to reside at Nicholaieff, and pledge itself not to build more than a certain number of vessels of war in its dockyards, but it will positively refuse either to raze the fortifications of the place or to do away with its arsenal. In Austrian Governmental circles it is relatedthat although France will agree to propose the statues quo on the eastem coast of the Black Sea, she will not make it a conditio sine qu& non ; but a foreign diplomatist assuresmethat theEmperorNapoleonwill bemoreexacting "thancertain highly-placed stockjobbers expect." No positiveinformationhasreachedme on the subject, but long experience enables me to foretell what will be the policy of Austria during the Conferences. She will go heart and hand with her allies in obtaining from Russia everything that can be obtained by diplomacy, but shoilld she observe that there is danger of the war being continued, she will not fail to implore France not to push matters too far. To England she will certainly not address herself, as she is aware that British Statesmen have no bye-reasons which could induce them to consent to sacrifice the future to the present. Instead of coming straight from Constantinople to this, city, Prince Callimachi will go by way of Marseilles to Paris... It is not quite clear what his objectcan be in taking such a roundabout road, but it is strongly suspected that the ex-Prince of Samos aspires to the rank and title of an Ambassador Etraordinary, and is unwilling to come here as Minister Plenipotentiary. Prince Callimachi probably wishes to come to an understanding with Count Buol on the subject. Ishara Bey, the Turkish Charge d'Affaires, is to return to Constantinople, anA the Porte will do well to recollect that it might just as well have no representative here as one who speaks no other language than his own. Arif Effendi was a mere cipher, and Isham Bey is said to be little better;s but the Porte ought always to have an accomplished diplomatist, who is a good patriot, at this Court. You have frequently been told in my correspondence that Austria is an extremely revengeful Power, and the following ancedote will serve to show that she condescends to revenge herself on individuals as well as' on states. Not long since, Count Nicholas Esterhazy-the chief of the younger branch of the illustrious house of which Prii1ce Paul Esterhazy is the head-fell ill, and as he was 81 years of age there was little or no hope of his recovery. His son, Count Paul Esterhazy, who, as you must recollect, played a prominent part in IHungary during the revolution, applied -for 'per- mission to return to Vienna, in order to take leave of his dying father, but his -request was refused. When the old gentleman was dead the. Count' requested that he might be allowed to be present at his father's funeral,' and, after some little' delay, he was informed that he would be allowed to come here, but only for 48 hours. Can ' such harshness be good policy ? His MIajesty lias ast a veil over the past in Lombardy and Venici, but it is by no means clear to me that the Hungarians, a noble and generous race, are less deserving of the Imperial clemency than'the Italians. The Merchant of Yea.ice is frequently given here; but what Portia says to Shylock 'on the quality of moery does not seemto have made any great impression on the mem- bers of is Majeaty's Cabinet. When he pardoned his Lombardo-Venetian subjects, the Emperor obeyed the impulse of his own heart, and he is said not to have troubled his official advisers for their opinion on the subject. His Majesty has just extended his mercy to M. Gabriel von Tdrok, a Hunguian, who was condemned to six years' imprison. ment for high treason. The Northern Railroad Company is about to take the Gallician Railway off the hands of Government, and to complete the line from Lemberg to Czernowitz, which is close to the Bessarabian fron. tier. The Gallician Railroad is of the utmost strategic importance to Austria, as when it is completed shemaylaughRussiatoseorn should she make any attempt to punish her fqr her infidelity. The grantees of the Queen Elizabeth or WesternRailroad are likely to become the proprietors of the so-called " First Austrian Raiload," which is a trainroad running from Budweis in Bohemia to Linz and Gmunden in Upper Austria. The Italian nobles who are about to take a part of the Italian railroads off the hands of Government are the Duke of Litta, Count Borromeo, Count Archinto, and the Marquis Rescalli. The company of which they are members consists of ii persons, who are represented here by Messrs. Mandolfo and Brot. From morning till night onie hears of nothing but projected railroads and "industriai" undertakings. The Englishmen now here on business connected with the railroads are Mr. Giles, for Sir Morton Peto; Mr. Campbell, for the house of Thomas Wilson; MIessrs. Blunt, Laing, and Uzielli for themselve3, and a Mr. Bates for some London firm, the name of which isunknownto me. The following is the motion made by the Oriental and Military Committee of the Bund after having examined the Austrian propositions :- "1 The German Diet, in addition to its resolutions of July 24th and December 9th, 1854, and to those of February 8th and July 26th, 1855, gratefuIly recognizes in the preliminaries which (hav-ing been recommended by the Imperial Austrian Court to the Imperial Russian Cabinet) have since been agreed to by all the belligerent Powers, the bases onwhich a firm and durable generalpeace may be esta. blished. The Bund sees that the speedy conclusion of peace is a European necessity, and therefore it will make the maintenance of those bases its task, with the reservation of its right to exercise its -free judgment in respect to the special conditions which the belligerent Powers may bring forw-ard. Fully apPreciating the steps already taken by Austria and Prussiu in this matter, the Bend expresses its confidence that those two Governments will continue to give their praiseworthy attention and care to the interests of the great Fatherland (Gesammt-Vaterlandes)." As you were some dayssince informed, the motion passed "em. con. It is related that Count Buol has taken with him to Paris a memorial respecting the Danibian Principalities which is the work of the head and hands of Baron Prokesch, and the story appears highly probable, as the diplomatist in ques- tion is troubled with a " cacoethes scrTierndi," as the ? members of the Vienna Conferences but too often had occasion to remark. The Burgomaster of this city tells me that the Archbishop of Vienna has not refused to allow a monlment to be erected in a church to the memory of Mozart. The fact is, that the matter ha never been mentioned to him. PRUSSIA. (EBOll OUR OWN CORRrESPODENT.) BERIiN', Fm. 28. It will be no matter of surprise to you when I state that there is not the slightest atom of political neWs to report to you from here; what is goingon in the great question of the day you learn much earlier than we do here. The resolution passed this day week by the Diet, adopting the five points with all sorts of reservations, that deprive it of any kind of value and worth, has left the matter pretty much as I it stood before; neither Germany nor even Prussia is any the nearer being invited to the Conferences. Any demarchDs that may be now making in Paris by Austria 'for the purpose of procuring the admission of Prnssia are certainly more in her own interest than Prussia's. She desires to add to her own another voice friendly to peace, and would be glad enough of the eÃ¯Â¿Â½clat in Germany of having her rival under her patronage. I do not hear of any efforts being made by this Government to procure its admission; the only thing that in any degree I looks like it was the recent despatch to Count Hatsfeld at Paris, of which I lately sent you an aperqu, which, however, desires anything but an invitation through Austria. A former despatch, which I also sent you, in answer to the Austrian communication that the Cabinet of Vienna would strive to obtain Prussia's admission, expressly deprecated it, and requested that it might be left alone. Professor Ehrenberg's microscope, which did such good service in procuring undeniable proof of the Simonides' fraud, has been made use of again to detect the thief that stole a barrel of specie, which had been purloined on one of the railways. One of a number of barrels, that should all have contained coin, was found on arrival at its destination to have been emptied of its precious contents, and refilled with sand. On Professor Ehrenber!r being consulted, he sent for samples of sand from all the stations along the different lines of railway that the specie had passed, and by means of his microscope, identified the station from which the interpolated sand must have been taken. The station once fixed upon, it was not difflicult to hit upon the culprit in the small number of employes on duty there. Next Saturday there is to be a -service for the dead, celebrated in the chapel of the Russian Embassy here, in commemoration of the death of the late Emperor Nicholas, the anniversary of which event it will then be. (The circumstance of this y'ear being. leap-year causes the anniversary to fall on the Ist, and not on the 2d March.) The Russian spokesmen here give out that the number of applications already sent in for tickets is so large that only a very small portion can meet with attention; to avoid any invidious distinctions, no official (i.e., on the part of the Embassy) invitations to any of the members of thle co?ps diplomnatiquc have been issued. Among the visitors of distinction who are expected to arrive here for the purpose of joining in this act of devotion are Duke George of Mecklenbug and the Grand Duchess Catherine of lussia. On her decision it depenas whether the service is to be a public one or not. In addition to the various statements I sent you yesterday, of the military preparations still being made by Sweden, in spite of the prospects of peace, I have to mention to-day that we learn by telegraph from Stockholm, that the Aftolobladet yesterday stated, that a Committee under the Presidency of the Crown Prince had been constituted, for the purpose of receiving and deliberating on plans for the fortification of Stockholm and the Maelar Valley. An accident of a peculiarly thriling nature occurred at Warsaw on the night of the 20th instaint. A travelling cairiage with four horses arrived at Praga late at night, and without any inquiries being made, drove on to the frozen Vistula for the purpose of crossing. The ice, however, broke through, and carriage, horses, and passengers sank into the stream--vho the latter were has not been ascertained. It only seems to be knowm that there were 10 persons, in all, who perished on this occasion. The .Flenburger Zeitunq states, that on the 2d instant the Danish Government proposed to the various representatives assembled at the Sound Dues' Conferences to abolish them ona receiving payment of 35,000,000 to 343,000,000 thalers, to be defrayed by the various $tates interested, according to a table drawn up by the Government. This proposal wab accepted at once by tle Russian representative, Tengoborski, without any erve, although Russia's share would amount to about one-third of the whole. It is represented that this project met with so much favour wthl the representatives assembled as to lead to the expectation of its being adopted by the various Governments. Mecklenburg and Hanover, who, as soon as they found what part Russia took up, sided with her, will, it is not doubted, accede willingly to the. proposal; this solution of the Sound Dues' question would be at the-tame time a recognition of the soundness of the basis on which Mecklenburg rests the Boitzenburg dues, and Hanover the Stade dues, the first producing 150,000 thalers tnnually, the latter still more. The amount which the Danish Government is now asking fdr is said to be just sufficient to pay off the whole foreign debt of Denmark, incurred previous to the last war. The former Danish Ministers, who were impeached for having applied moneys of the State to purposes not authorized by the representatives of the people, were yesterday acquitted. All the members of the Landthing pronounced a verdict of guilty, but the members of the highest -Court, on the contrary, gave their vote for " not guilty." ITALY. The 0 tinimve, of Turin, of the 27th uit., publishes the following report of the proceedings in the Chamber of Deputies on the 26th:- "' TheoPresident having taLen the chair, M Deviry rose and said,-' I intend to demand explanations from the Mimistry relative to a very serious occurrence, which took place at Novara on Friday evening: I mean the mutiny amnong the soldiers of the Anglo-ItaliaLeegion. lam crediblyinformedt'hat troops were marched in that direction, but the papershaving published no account of the affair, I expected that the lfinistry would have assumed the initiative, and given the public sorne explanations on the subject. It has not thought properto doso, andInow callontheMlinisterof the Interior to-remove the apprehension excited by the reports in circulation.' " M. Rattazzi, Minister of the Interior, replied, 'Those reports are totally unfounded, for no rioting took place in the town of Novara, nor among the men of the Anglo-Italian Legion. The officers were induced to adopt measures of precautioain consequence of an apprehension of disturbances, but the reportstheyhadreceivedwere erroneous, andtheinformation transmitted to Government proves that their fears were groundless. The officers of the Legion apprised the Governor of what was going on; an active surcimanwc was exercised - and, it being deemed expedient to airest several soldiers, that mission devolved on the local authorities. There is the whole truth. I did not think proper to contradict, in the official journal, the exaggerated reports in cifculation; for if the Gover-nment were to contradict every idle and unfounded rumour, that task would occupy its whole timie. Besides, I foresaw that a parliamentary interpellation would be addressed to the Cabinet, and enable me to give those explanations.' " M. Deviry.-The Minister will allowme to obgerve that the arrests of the refactory soldiers must have been justified by the gravity of the facts. I will also ask him how long the Anglo-Italian Legion is to remain in Piedmont. Recruiting has been authorized, but not a permanent encampment. WhentheDuke of Modena demanded a passage for his troops across our territory, that passage was granted to them, but they were previously obliged to deposit their arns in waggons, which were escorted to the frontier by our Custom officers. The Englislh Government has declared that, after the war, the Anglo-Italian Legion would be employed in its colonies. Does it consider Piedmont as one of those colonies ? (Murmurs.) The English exercise an immediate and direct jurisdiction in their barracks. -'-3L Rattazzi.-I deny it. " .L Deviry.-I direct the attention of the h,inisty to those facts. "M Rattazzi.-No jurisdiction has been conceded to the English Government or to English agents on the Sardinian territory, nor in the quarters occupied by the legion. The arrests I mentioned were made by agents of the King's Government. The more or less prolonged stay of the legion on our territory vdll be settled by negotiation between the two Governments. That stay, however, will not be permanent, and I will addthat, when the EnglishGovernmentsaid that the Anglo-Legion would be employed in colonies, it did Dotmnean to insult Piedmont. There is no analogy whatever between the presence of the legion and the passage of the troops of Modena, for the former are the troops of an allied Government, who may bo safely allowed to remain armed on our territory. " The incident baving dropped, the remainder of the sitting presented no interest." A private letter from Turin states that the number of soldiers airested did not exceed 30. It had been ascertained that several of them had enlisted under false nanmes. On beig searched they were found to be furnished with perfectly regular passports, delivered to them by tlle Austrian police. One of the most active agents of the Mazzinian party anTived in Piedinont a fortnight ago. The regiment of the Anglo-Italian Legion hitherto quartered at Novara passed thiough Turin on the 26th,i proceeding by railway to Suza. M.

II ON"MABKbYand CITY InXTL y.MN Fuiday Evening. The noile from the Treasury that there wi e no advance in the rate of interest on Exchequer-bills when those fal1xig due on the 7lth of March are presented for payment or renewal indicated th} confidence of the Government in the present state of their financialrrangementx$ and caused thefunds to open this morning at a recowry of a quarter Per cent. There was afterwards a sudden and rather severe decline, followed onlybya partial reaction. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 914 to j, were firs quoted 911 to J. A number of reports were then circulated that the Conferencee at Paris had taken a very unfavourable tur, and, as some persons were ready to believe that all the precautions taken for secrecy had alray proved ue lees against the means of information poassesed by a* fewv of the speculative dealers in the Stock-:Exchange, a fall occurred of more than one per cent., trsnsactions having been effected for the a at 902 As the close of business approached, and none of the rumours thus put forth received confirmation, a rally occurred, and the latest bargains were at 91k to J for money and 914 to i for the 11th of March. Consol Scrip left off at 1f to J premium. Bank Stock, 2134 to 215; Reduced, 91i to i; WewThree per Cents., 924 to A; India-bond&-, 6a. to 2s. discount; Excheqaer.bonds, 974 to 98; and Exchequer-bills (March), 4s. to Is. discount, (June), 2s. discount to ls. premiun. Foreign securities opened with firmness. There was subsequently sorne little heaviness, prices generally being rather lower towards the close. In Turkish the decline ranged from half to one per cent. The Six. per Cents. were negotiated at 95 and 94 for money, and 9 9*, and 95 for the account. Tras te GuaranteelFd our per Cents. took place at 99i, 100, 99, and; for money, and 100I and 100 for the account ie general business comprised-Brazilian Small, 102X ; Danish Five per Cents., 104; Granada; NewkActive,; 20j to 21; the Deferred, 7; Russian Five per Cents., 104; the Four-and-a-Ralf per Cents., Small, 934; Sardinian Five per Cents., 90; Spanish New Deferred, 23liE and 4; Passive, 64; Venezuela, 294; and Belgian Two-and-a-Balf per Cents., 534. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates of last post were maintained, but there was no further advance. In the corn-market this morning there was increased heaviness, and sales could not have been pressed, except at a decline of 2s. or 3s. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a quiet business at fanner prices. The closing quotations of the F?rench Tree per Cents, on the Paris B6urse this evening were 72f. 75c. for money and 72f 80c. for the account, showing a decline of less than an eighth. Looking at the agitation which has prevailed to-day on the London Stock-Exchange, The marketinay, therefore, be considered to have exhibited great firmness. The montlhly settlement is said to be passing off with much less difficulty than had been apprehended A numerous meeting took place to-day at the London Tavern of persons interested the Royal Swedish Railway Company, Mr. It Rhodes presiding, to consider the unauthorized issue of shares and obligations by the late chairman, l5r. Sadleir. It was stated that no suspicion of any irregularity was aroused until about the 15th of the present month, and that Mr. Sadleir, when appealed to on Saturday, the 16th, promised the secretary he would prepare a full statement and present it on the following Monday. His death havingmeanwhileoccurred, there wasno alternative but to announce the fact and to adopt precautionary measures. Some of the principal shareholders having been consulted, it was determined to call in the aid of MIessrs. Broom and Bagshaw, the accountants, by whom a preliminary investigation was made, the result of which is embodied in the following figures. It was explained that the committee temporarily appointed entertained no desire to continue in office, and that theyhad only assumed the responsibility of instituting an initiatoryproceedmgtobring the question under the consideration of the proprietors, who were recormmende& to appoint a new and enlarged body to carry out a thorough inquiry into the situation of the company. For this purpose the necessity of a calm and impartial discussion was suggested, since, serious as the prospect is, it may be greatly aggravated by precipitate litigation or the enforcement of pressing claims. The project was stated to be inherently sound, and it was also observed that if plans can be deased for reorganizing its management, the Sedlish Government may be inclined to afford further facilities for its com pletion. The debate that ensued principally related to the situation of the holders of the unautlhorized shares and obligations, but this, it was urged, could not be decided till a further report was presented. The general feeling was favourable to the formation of a new comramittee, giving them power to make a searching investigation preparatory to any proposals for arrang,ement, the directors pledging themselves to be bound by the advice and instructions of its members until their labours are completed. Eventually a committee of seven, including MIr. Chaplin andlMr. Tottie, the Swedish Consul, was appointed, but some of the shareholders were dissatisfieda at the exclusion of particular names, and protested against the manuer in which the votes had been taken. Subjoined are the statements submitted by the Committee of Investigation. From the fact that Mr. Sadleir seems to have issued shares irregularly not only for his own purposes, but also forthose of the company, and that the transactions in this respect have been almost indiscriminate, it is difficult to ascertain at present the actual amount of his delinquencies on personal account. It will be seen that the total over-issue of 51. shares beyond the 83,334 which were authorized as the capital of the company is -l6,291, the nominal Talue of which is 81,455Z., and that the over-issue of obligations of 41. each beyond the 25AOOO authorized is 18,782, of an aggregate value of 75,1281. As a large proportion, however, of the original amount of shares and obligations hadnever been issued to the public, but were retainedby the company until Mr. Sadleirmisappropriated them, his fraud will probably be found much larger than the two sums thus represented of 81,4551. and 75,1281. Together they make 156,5831.; but it is possible that the total issue appropriated by himself may prove to have been 250,0007. Until the exact nature of his accounts with the company shall have been ascertained there will be no practicability of determining this point. Everything seems to indicate that his brother directoix allowed him to act without control of any kind, leaving him to borrow money for the company on any terms or pretences he pleased, and to help himself to its assets whenever the pressure of his own afiairs impeUled him to that course. A more extraordinary instance of neglect and infatuation on the part of a public board has never transpired, and the culpability of those who have thus betrayed the intereas of their constituents is without mitigation, except such as is aflordedbythe belief that theirdisregard of duty was not accompanied by anyintentional dishonesty. l3nderthe circumstances,the grand point of inquiry will now be as to the method in which the undertaking may meet its difficulties, and prevent the money already laid out, and which by the balance-sheet appears to have been about 300,0001., from remaining unproductive. Any attempt to repudiate the over-issued shares is apparently out of the question. They are understood to be iree from the slightest taint of forgery or irregularity which could throw any onus upon the holders or exonerate the company from liability uponthem, and it may be hoped, for the honour of London, that, unless facts should transpire wholly different from anything at present known, the disgrace will not be incurred even of contemplating such a course. It is true that in the instance of Mlr. Schuyler and the New York and New Haven Railway, which perhaps gave Mr. Sadleir the first idea of thismode of plunder, the original shareholders are endeavouring to contest the claims of the holders of the stock he over-issued; but this course has drawn upon them the unequivocal condemnation of the omlmercial public, and has been cited in Europe as another example of American laxity. In the present case, moreover, all the circumstances m favour oftheholdersarebelievedto-be still stronger and clearer than in that instance SzrAxxExT AccouNrG ro 8334 SARS, rim AUTHruORIZED SHAsE CAMrrAx or THE COMPASY.

For the latter the capital proposed is 800,0001., but inneither case is any sign furnished. that the schemes are of a respectable charact-er. It is rumoured, indeed, that they have merely beenput forward for temporary purposes, and the supposition, is countenanced by the fact that few persons with bon4fide intentions would be likely to sanction the publication of premature a-nd unsupported notifications, such as it is in the power of any adventurers to put forth. With regard to the probability of any further projects of this kind being entertained, supposing even that they should appear with respectable names, it is to be hopedthat therelianceof thepromoters on the follly of the public wil be disappointed. There may possibly be roomfor such as have thus far been antnounced, but no question can exist that the extreme limit has been reached.

RAILWAY AND MINING sHAEs. Friday Evening. The railway-marbet was steady, and prices, on the average, were well supported. Towards the .lose, in sore cases, there was rather les firmness. Australian land and banking shares were fairly mainltained. London and County Bank shares recovered a little from their previous depression, and were negotiated at 37 and 38. Other descriptions showed -no remarkable variation. Bank of Egypt left off 1 to 11 pm.; Ottoman Bank, k to j pm.; and National Discount Company, i dis. to j pm. In Alliance Bank shares there was an improvement, and the last transactions were at par. ORDMNARY SIIARES ARD STOWI1nR
BAILWAY INTELLIGATCE. * EASTERN COUNTTEVS. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern. There was a uUll attendance of shareholders. When the directors entered the room at 1 o'clock they were received with cheers and groans. Mr. Waddingi'on, M., having taken the chair, The SECREAY read the advertisement calling the meetnr. FRANKLYN, hXP. for Poole, complained that the re- ports and acounts. had not been delivered till that morning, i and moved that for the future the report and accounts I should be delivered at least one week before the half-yearly meeting. The motion having been seconded, The CuAPrnaais said that as far as practicable thnat should be done. The motion was then agrecd to. The report (an abstrat of whlich appeared in 21W Tinms of yesterday) was then taken aS read. The CHAIRIux said, that in addressing the meeting on the report he did so with deep anxiety. He was anxious for a fair and cahn discussion, and that the business of the meeting should be conducted in a conciliatory spirit. He regretted that the report had not been issued at an earlier period, and explained the cause of the delay, but stated that the same thing would not occur again, as a resolution had been passed by the board requesting Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and e accountants, to devise measures to prevent it, aind also to point out, generally, a bystein by which the future accounts of the comnpany in every department niight be more efficiently conducted. In the accoant the proprietors would notice thiat the extraordinary expenditure was stated tob e 47,9141. 1s. 7d. The first iterm was for the renewal of line and bridges, 15,000M. There was a difference of opinion whether that amount ought to be placed as an expense to this half-year, or whether they ought not to have ta'ken the total amount of the expenditure and debited it to the revenue. The view of the directors was this, that although at the last half-yearly meeting they stated that the expenses account should be open, and that a sum of from 12,5001. to 15,0001. per aunum would me_t the case, allowing it to spread over a space of ten years in the one case and 15 years in the other, yet when they camne to consider the question they felt they were not in a position to say whether one sum or the other should be the amuount, but thebhoard did feel that if 15,00 were set aside it would give confidence to the proprietary,inasmueh as it would assare themthat a further amount was contemplated for expenditure oin this account. The next iteu was 7,3411. 1&s: 10d. for additional repairs and alterations of roadways, stations, and approaches. He confessed that when he received the engineer's account of the necessity of such an expenditure it appeared to him to be a most astounding sum, but he informed him that the station-yards, the metalling, the turntables, and other things had been suffered to get to such a state that it was absolutely requisite that those repairs s9hould bh made. It was, however, an exceptional case, and would rot again come under the same heading of the account. Then c3me the followving itemns-naiely, 125. for the survey of the line; 6231. 13s. 7d. for d:ficiency of stores at the sheet manufactoiy; and 1,5)01. set aside for the half-yearlydepreciation in sacks and sheets. Iast half-year a considerable amount was debited to the capital account for iucrease of business requiring sacks and sheets, but there had been a great loss with reference to sacks. Where there was a great number of stations it was inpossible to know howv the sack account stood. The next item was for the loss on the working of the Harwich and Ip wich and the Harwvich aud Antwerp boats for one year. That item was set down at 5,9761. 15s. 7d. It had been already stated to the proprietors that this was tried as 'an experiment. Other companies had done so with great benefit to themiiselves and to the public. The directors thought it was their duty to pioneer a route which might otherwise eventually be taken up by others, and wvhich they believed would bring a large amuount of profit to the company. But, feelin- the responsibility to be too great for this attempt, they lad resolved that, as this was their first loss under that head, it shoald be the last. (Hear, hear.) A sum had been set apart to meet disputed claims and charges not previously ascertained. That sum amounted to 17,3471. 3s. Md. This item was not quite correctly described. There had been a loss on the amount of stores of 2 8881. 18s. ; and there were dislputed claims, the particulars of wlich he should not go into, bat which he believed they would be able successfaully to resist. But for these extraordinary items the directors would have been able to declare a dividend of Ss. a-share instead of 4;. 6d In reference to the permanent way depreciation, although that amount had been debited to the capital account, yet he thoughIt it right to inforni the meeting that such was not the course taken by other comlpanies, but that they provided a reserved fund to mieet that charge. He found that the North-Eastern Railway Company was 34,9521. in debt on account of the permanent way depreciation charge, but whiclh would be gradually absorbed out of the reservation fund. The amount expended by the London and NorthWestern for t'he renewal of the permnanent way was 268,4401., and the company had decided that a weight of metal should be added to the rails, and additional sleepers should be introduced, ancd that it was right the whole charge should go to the capital account, inasniuch as the line was deficiently made in the first instance. The Midland Railway Company adopted the same principle. That companv had expended 88,0001. upon the renewal of the permanent way whichit wasproposed to pay off by annual paynients of 30,0001. On behalf of the board, he begged to inform the meeting that the directors of this company would adopt a similar plan of assigning a certain annual sun for this purpose when the engineer had obtaincd experience as to the amount necessary to maintain their line in the most efficient state of repair. He much regretted that the miscellaneous expenses of the company slowed so large an addition dmung the last half-year, and, without wishingto cast the slightest reflection upon aiy one, he should fail in his duty if he did not state that duiing the last six months while the Committee of Investigatioin was sitting the proceedings of that committee necessarily distracted the attention of the executive, and they were not able to Day that attention to the minutiaef railwaymanagement which was absolutely necessary in order to obsere economy in all its departments. (" Oh! oh !" and cheers.) It was his solemn conviction that a large additional expense had been incurred by that circumnstance alone. (Hear, hear.) He was happy to say that the locomotive traffic was in a nmost7efflcient state. Ahr. Gooch, the engineer of tha. department, whose term of sei-vice would expire in May, had felt it his duty to keep the stock in that efficient state; but there had necessarily been a large expenditure, it being, no doubt, the desire of Mr. Gooch to avoid any charge of having allowed the stock to be depreciated in order that he might obtain any additional percentage. He thought it a matter of congratulation to the proprietors that the prospect of a speedy peace would berzalized, by wihich a considerable reduction in the pnce of materials would be effected. As the charges to be borne by the Eastern Union and Norfolk Railways were at a fixeed percentage, any saving by a reduction of expenditure, would come exclusively into the pockets of the Eastern Counties Coinpany. (Laughter.) Gentlemen might laugh, but he was told that th:e increase in the price of oil between S13o and the present timue was 41 per cent.; in copper 20 per cent. in brastubes, 12 percent.; in cast-steel, 10 per cent; in iron-bar ends, 20 per cent.; and intireper c enr ceut.. In reference to the lines of railwa3y now being promoted by hostile interests, one was that of the Norfolk Company in reference to the Wells and Fakenliam line, against which the directors had felt it their duty to petition. There were also two bills before Parliament for constructing a line from Beccles to ILowestofta and another line from Haddiscoe to Yarmouth. The directors would neglect their dutyif they did not oppose these bills, which if carried in a hostile spirit, would seriously jeopardize the Easteha Counties Company. Every opposition would therefore be given tothe further progress of those measures. The directors had a bill before lwarliame for the purpose of placing the capital stock on a more satisfactory footing. It would be the duty of the board to submit the bill to the proprietors, when they would have an opportunity of discussing it. He wvas not aware of any other point in the report calling for remark. A PP.FoPRIEToR.-The cabs. The CQ uiiRmA?.-In reference to the cabs, there had been a loss of 10L, after debiting 5 per cent. interest upon the stock enmployed. The company entered upon the cab systemn entirely with the view of accommodating the public. There were frequent complaints of the incivility of the cabnien and of the class of cabs at the stations, but no such complaints were ever made now, and he thought that this was well worth an expenditure of 1501. The capital invested in cabs was8,99v. 8s. He was sorry to haveto refer to the report of the accountants in reference to the stores department. They said that the accounts of the stores depaTtment were in a very imperfect state, being very considerably in arrear, and not presenting any data whereby to enable them to judge of the accuracy of the issues of stores charged during the half-year. It was not his wish to referparticularly to his colleague, Mr. Bruce, but, astthat gentleman got up the present system, he would no doubt explain, the matter to the meeting. The accountants also stated, upon the revenue account generally, that while the half-year was burdened with considerable items which had originated in the traffic of former periods, there remained certain outstanding contingencies yet to be provided for out of revenue to the amount of about 10,0001. One of the chief items charged to the revenue account was compensation for injuries to passengers, and costs incident thereto, amounting to 3,4101. 1i5s. lOd. The practice adopted by the board had been to exhibit on the balancesheet the payments made during the last half-year on account of accidents; but the auditors and sone two or three of the directors were of opinion that not only the amount Daid last half-year, but the amount paid this half-year, ought to be exhibited. He thought this to be contrary to all sound system. He had nowv gone through the report; and all lie had to request was that the proprietors would direct their attention exclusively to the business before the meetinig, and discuss it temperately, so that they might go away with the reflection that as far as regarded the accoants there had been a full, free, and fair explanation-that there had been no bickering, no quarrelling, but that they had conducted themselves throughout as mneni of business. (Cheers.) The chairnian then moved that the report be received and adopted. Mr. B,aGsrnvtw was understood to second the motion. Dr. RILEY, Mr. NOP.RIS, and Mr. LovE then addressed the meeting at great length; going over the various topics that have so frequently been discussed at former meetings of this company, and reiterating the charges of mismanagement agoainst theC directors, and especially against the chairman. Mr BRUCE (the Deputy-Chairman) said, that as the chairman had made an allusionl to him in reference to the management of the stores departmient, he begged to state that in June last he wvas nomianated chairman of the stores committee, and endeevoured for many weeks to have a storekeeper and a bookkeeper appointed, but he wvas interfered with by the chairman, and tbhe gentleman wrhom be proposed as-bookkeeper was rejected, .and one whom the chair- anza recommended was appointed, and it waS dwinog to that gentleman's eneapacity that the accounts wvere not fur ni.shed. The CHAIARMAN denied having appointed any gentaleman to be bookkeeper in the stores department. In the conrse of the proceedings of the meeting,i which were for the most partcsan-ed en amd, every description of neise and confusion, Mr. LOvE askedthe chairman whether the accounts of 3Mr. Gooch, the locomotive superintendent, bad been audited; but, the chairman not maakng anyreply, Mr. Love put the question to Mr. Reeves, the auditor, wsho stated that Mr. Gooch's accounts had not been laid before him, and consequently had not been audited. Mr. MALms, at the close of a long speech, observed that the Eastern Counties Railway embraced Z very compact district, which he thought, if well munaged, might return the shareholders large profits, and he advised them not for a moment to entertain the idea of leasing their line until they had put it into proper order, and had seen wiether it was not possible for them to work it thermselves with benefit to the slhareholders. After some further pc :ches from various parties, 3Mr. HNAmi moved; s asiamendment that the report be received and adopted o far only as rela'ed to the declaring of a dividend; but th; t the report and accounts in all other respects be received, t not adopted, and that the accouts be referred back to the auditors for a more perfect audit. Dr. RILEY seconded the amendment. It Was here stated that the original motion had not bean seconded, M1r. Bagshaw having denied that he had seconded-it. After some little delay, hr. SEDGWIcK seconded the orginal motion, whereupon Mr . HAINE moved his amendment, and, on a show of hands, The CILRMAsN' declared that the amendment was carried by 155 votes against 70. Mr. GOODSON demanded a poll, but subsequently withdrew it. Mfr. HAEIE then moved the following resolution "That the paynent of 2,0001. to the chairnman of the company should be discontinuedd' Dr. RILEY-seconded the motion. The CHA1I1MANT said, that before putting the motion he begged to state that if it were carried it could not possibly affect him, because his position as a director would terminate that day. He begged to add that even if he were reelected a director, and re-appointed to the chair, he woulld niot receive any portion of the salary, were the present mlotion to be defeated, untilafter the next half-yearly mieeting, as he did not consider the present meeting to be sufficienitly cool to come to a rational determtination upon the subject. (" Oh, oh P and cheers.) The motion was then put, and carried almost unani- mously. A resolution was then passed that the expenses out of pocket of the Committee of Investigation shouold be paid by the comnpany. (Three cheers for thei commnittee.) d long and noisy discussion ensued, in the cowuse of which a resolution, proposed by r. Hiicks, for the formation of a permanent committeeof35shareholders, to keep a check upon thedirectors and the expenditure of the company, was negatived by a large majority. It wsas agreed that Mr. Waddington should be paid the expenses of his reply to the report of the committee of investigation. Mr. Reeves, the retiring auditor, was re-elected. The candidates for three seats at the board were then proposed and seconded. It was agreed that a show of hands should be taken in each case, and a poll be demanded. On the inotionfor the re-election of Mr. Waddington the show of hands was against his re-election; the show of hands was in favour of M1r. Helps; against Mr. Packe ; in favour of Mr. Walters; against Mr. Goodson * in favour of Mr. Orr; and against Mr. Morrison. A poll was demanded in each ease. The CHrAIrMAN stated that the poll would commence at 6 and last till 8 o'clock, from 9 o'clock on Saturday (this) morniing, and last till 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and also remain open during the same period on Monday and Tuesday next. On Wednesday the scratineers would ascertain the state of the poll, and on Thursday, at 12 o'clock, the result -would be declared. In reply to a question at the close of the meeting it was stated that it was absolutely necessary that all shareholders who had personaly attended the mecting should also personally record their votes, in order to avoid the loss of them, notwithstanding the proxies which they might have signeL SOUTH WALES. The half-yearlyimeeting of the proprietorsofthiscompany was held yesterday at the Great Western Hotel, Paddington; Mr. C. R L Talbot, It:P., the chairman of the company, presieing. Mr. F. G. Si;'xDnBs, the secretary, read the report for the last half-ymar, which stated that the revenue receipts dnring the half-year amoiuted to 163,0161. 3s. 3d. and the expenses to 87,855L ls. 9d. The receipts and espenses on account of revenue for the half-year ending the 31st of December, 1855, as compared with those of t7ae corresponding half-year of 1854, showed that the receipts were increased by 18,6011., and the expenses by 1lQ8621. The balance available for the ordinary dividend, after;providing for dividend on thepreference shares, was 47,79 61. 13s. 9d. The directors reconunended that a dividend for the half-year should be paid upon the ordinary share capital of the company at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum That would require 36,7551. lls. 3d., and would leave a sum of 1, 0411. 2s. 6d. to be carried forward to the credit of the current half-year. Difficulties which had arisen in the negotiations with the owners and occupiers of property near Neyland, anud delays in obtaining possession of the land, had, with other causcs, retarded the completion and opening of the railway to Milford Eaven. Thesa difficulties had, however, now been overcome, and every exertion was biing mnade tn complete the line. The negotiations whlich had for some time Ieen pending between the Great Western, South lVales, Waterford and Ulnerick, and Waterford and iiLkenny RailwayCompanies, with a view to the establishment of steam communication between Milford Haven and the south of Ireland, and the agreenments proposed to be entered into vith Messrs. Mare and Co. for the construction and working of the steamers, had since the last half-yearly meeting been terminated by the bankruptcy of that firm. No other arrangement had yet been made for securing the object which the directors of the four companies had in view. Upon -the opening of the railway to Milford Haven, the directors proposed to make provision for the conveyance of passengers and goods between the Neyland terminus and Pembroke Dock. The facilities whichthey might be enabled to afford the public for communication between these places would, in a great measure, depend upon the consent of the Admiralty and of the War Department being obtained to the use of the pier at Hohb's Point, thc most convenient site of the south side of the haven for the purposes contemplated. The CIrUMRais, in moving the adoption of the report, said, he could not congratulate the shareholders on the payment of a large dividend, but it was as good as they had hitherto received, and one which he trested the company would be able hereafter to maintain as a 2niZaialUvn. They might have divided 3A per cent., but they had thought it more prudent not to divide more than 3 per cent., having regard to the contingencies to which all companies were. liable, and p-irticalarly this, in its relation to the Great Western. There was one item which affected their receipts very considerably-namely, the award recently rmade with respect to the -use of the Glocester station. The chairman of the Great Western stated at the recent meeting of that company "that there was an arbitration, by which a further sum was expected from.the South 'Wales Company for the agreed use of the Glocester station, and that the arbitration on that point was closed on theprecedingday, andthatthe GreatWestern might add under that head to the credit of their account a sum of 5,1001." He (the chairma,,) might say that if that award had beeno,0001. in favour of the South Wales, it would have enabled them to pay a dividend of 4 per cent. The claim arose inthis way:-Duringthetie theline hadbeenopened a large accumulation of questions had arisen in reference to its working, and eventully the Great Western and the South Wales boards felt it wvas absolutely necessary to refer those questions to arbitration. When they were under discon the question of the Glocester station was mooted, and he confessed he was strongly averse from any such question going before an arbitrator, because he did not understand how it could have arisen, seeing that the Glocester station was not upon the South Wales lRailwvay at all, and the directors felt that they ought no more to be called upon to pay any expenses connected with that station than if ithad been the Swindon station, or any otherupon the Great Western line. (Hear, hear.) It was, nevertheless, agreed that that point should be submitted, among the rest, to arbitration. But the award of 5,0001. had conme on him by surprise. There was an interchange of traffic between the Midland and other railways a.t Glocester, and the Great Western having provided accommodation for that traffic, it wvas fair that they should be remunerated for that service, but the remuneration was very much larger than he had expected it would be. There was another reason why the traffic of the South Wales was not so large as had been anticipated, and that was the enornious sum they had to pay for locomotive power upon that linenamely ls. 7d. per mile, which had a serious effect on their profits. Their rolling stock for the last half-year had cost them 31 per cent., and their carrying cost had been 5 per cent. The locomotive cost of the Great Western, on the other hand, was 9 per cent., andtheir carrying cost per cent. It was commonly supposed tbatthelocomotive cost was 10d. per mile, and if the South Wales Company paid ls. 7d., they wodld pay at least 75 percent. more than iftheyworkedthelinethemselves. If the South Wales Company had worked the line them- selves, and the saving in Iocomuoti.ve cost had been added to theirreceipts, he believed theywould haveno difficulty at this time of paying a dividend of 4A per cent. Besides, not only had they to pay that ls. 7a. per mile, but the whole system under which the goods trafflc of the South Wales was worked, under the awvard of SirWF. Cubitt, was one o f pains and penalties. What had been the consequence? The largest traffic they expected on the South Wales was that derived from coal. They began in a small -way, with six or eig>ht trains a-week; but in a short time the coal proprietors found they were losing money, because the company couldnot carry coals eexcept at a very high charge. The result w,as that at that moment the traffic had allen offto four trains a-week, and the parties who sent those four trains a-week suffered a loss upon every ton of coals they carried. (Hear, hear.) Counected also with the subject of the coal trade, he wished to call attention to a small railway called the Bullopill line. The principal coal trade which they were doing at this roment was from the Bullopill line, and it would be a most instructive and useful lesson if the directors were first to cast their eye over the sum which that little line had cost the South Wales Company-namely, 18e,6921., but if to that were added the law and Parlikmentary expenses, he should not be far wrong in saying it had cost them 200,0001. The line was only six miles long, but it had- a bad gradient, and it could only be worked by an engine of enormous power, and the traffic, so farfrom increasing, had rather fallea off since the South Wales had made the improvements on that line. The purchase-money for the line was 90,0001.; the sum paid for way-leaves -was 19,0001. ; other expenses 7,0001.; and improvements 70,0001.; and it would have been far better if they had made a new line altogether. He was happy to say, however, that it was the only branch the South- Wales possessed on their whole- line, and he hoped it would always be the only branch, for nothing was so injurious to railway compaies as the posessiorn of branch lines, (Hear, hear.) He would advert to the difficulties they had in organizing a coal trade. Mtere were in South Wales three different sorts of coals, am! in that respect it differed from every coal basin in the world. Some mi-sapprehiensionexistedintheo blic =midwith ragardtoWchh coals The Great W teftCo.mpany intheir leprhad refedto dto thecoal traffi a in 2orthWa es. an2om ut of the parties eonnected with that company hadpi-oposedtrw embark capital in that traffic. There were plentI collieries in South Wales, and haw was it that the gentlemen connected -ith the Great Western had never opened a collery there? The reason was that the coal in STOtli Wlales was steam coal, and that in North Wales was snitablj for domestic purposes. The South Wales coal was su#tblei for furnaees iud engines, and ought to comne to Londa in large quantities, hit it did not. Some time aro t Soath Wales board hadanmiterview with the Greatesier board, to ascertain their opinion on the coal trade-; and various propositions were considered, but now-that the ject as to tbe North Wales coal had been been saimi e1t ithe Great Western shareholders, that was conclusiv the South Wales directors, and they wodld iiot 'po':. colliery at all to supply iondon wben they bad t&-Cop' pete with such- a powerful company. To giie asa idea of the extent to which coal was raised in South S-al' he was raising on his own propertyalone 700,000 tons yat -, and, that was raised by persons exceedingly anxious ' tend their transactions. But his advice to those persons was not to do so, because they wouldonlylosenmouev,. There was one paragraph in the Great Western reportl which hadcaused great excitement in SouthW21es-nainyi that which stated that I,a considerable xaineral tiiMi, from the interchange of red ore from Birkenhead for, the irOnmasters in South Wales, :with stezn coals bacck froix that distriCt to the river Mersey, has been recently tlesub-; ject of an arrangement among the several railway vcoin'_nies interested in it.' That paragraph had given nise toireatb ndsunderstanl(ling in South Walea.

(A -.igh.) lIe was a member of the Eastern Steam Ravigation crinpaniy, and he concurred in the resolution to which th, qia coine, that it would be preferable to start the ship f liverpool, oving to the extreme -want of every kind of accm;-' mnodation in Idilf4rd Haven for a vessel of her size. But 'tE lad not altered his opinion, that eventually the ship-ruiui; start fromu MIford Haven under a better state of 'thbig 'ehich he hoped to see instituted there. There was a-grest talk of mialkig Milford Haven the port of Manchester, linit; he thought that was a visionary scheme, for whateve'r bs expectations mipght be as to Mlilford Haven being a ul-ace -f export, he did not think it would ever become 3port of import. He could not doubt, however, that ultimately :t would become the most important place in the kdindom fcr export, more particularly of coal. (Bear.) It possessed intliat; respect great advnrtages over Swansea and Cardig; vhere thb passing tolls were exceedingly heavy, and ships were liable to great demurrage. Besides, at Mlford Haven a ship could go to sea at any time of the tide; and he believed that could not be said of any other port in the kirgdom,,except, perhaps, Southampton. EXe would next ad'vert to the question of holding the meetings ofI tlle company in South Wales. As it was at presrc, ihe whiole of the traffic in South EWales was on ~theIi shoulders of one man., who was there without any moi'f - support of the board of directors. He (The chairman) kocmw - one gentleman who would put a trafiEc of 20,000!. -. yeiir nipon the line, but he declined to do it, so long as there wtasi that want of friendl2y intercourse boetween the directors and~ the inhabitants of the districtL At the same -tiine it was difficult to get a meeting of the direct6rs in South Wales, seeing that every director who livcr in London would have to sacrifice three days -hir attending a meeting at that- distance from -le. metropolis. The vice-chairman, however, had agiven notice of a motion the object of which was that the traffic coin- mittee, at least, might hold their meetings in South WiiIesi - and he hoped that would remedy the evil to some extent Mr. DE WiNToN congratulated the meeting, on -e - satisfactory state of the affairs of the conipainy, - which vas proved by their shares being wortthfrom 731. to 741. each in the market, while t;iose of the Great WVestern weie 'not worth more than l0.7 a-share. He was glad that the award of Sir Wiliam Cnbitt - would cease in 1857, for it had been exceedingly d&4i-nental to their line. (Hear, hear.) He reminded'-the niceting that the parael line of the Newport, Abergaveiuv,n and Hereford P' way was likely to become a thorn in 'heir side by-and-by, and suggested that it would be wise to imk-e an an.icable arra-ngement with that company, if possibl Aiid. prevent the inconvenience of competition vith them. ' - Mr. PHELiPP4, ,.LP, thought it extraordinary that,' when it was stated in August last that the Tailway weis to he opened in two months to MAilford Raven. and that provision wnas to be made for the conveyance of passeug5a aid. goods between the Neyland terninus and Pembroke Docl; subject to the consent of the Addmiralty andthe War Diartmnent being obtained to the use of the pier at HobbVs Point, application had not been made to the Admiralty and the War Departmuent until very recenily He complained, too, of some part of the permanent Waybeing laid down on Barloves patent, and which was not at all in a satisfactory state. Major COUnT thought it would be exceedinglynywiSe to extend the operations of the company to the buildin qE steamboats, and trusted that nothing further would be done in that direction vithout the consent and approbation of the shareholders. (Hear, hear.) He was ,lad, also, to. hear the chairman speak of the -impropriety ofthe company cnag-ing in the working of collieries. He considered - that quite as objectionable an enterprise as the constraction- of steamboats. He did not think the company had anythin to do with any other muatter than the management .c their own railway; and, if they did that well, they mi,ht depend upon it that the public would resort to their line, if they found it suit their purpose to do so. (Hear, hea;-.) Mr. RIDGWAY spoke in sanguine ternis of the ultimate advantages of Milford Haven asa shipping port, and advined the company to shake off the traunnels with which they were bound to the Great Western, and to depend on the.resources of their own line, wlich were capable of great development. Mr. G. B. ALL E appealed to the chairman to know if lie v.as right in assuming that the company could no' deelarerva dividend after August next, unless the branch to Pembrokewas com,pleted before that time, towards which be belivci& no steps had been taken ? The CHAt.ntLAz said that was a legal question, and sIcclined to give an answer to it. The Pembroke line had never' been commenced. Parliamneut had refused to renew the powers of the coinpanyto make it last year, andthose powershad lapsecl. After some further conversation the report was agreed to, and a dividend, at The rate of 3 per cent. per annuma, arthe half-year, was declared upon the ordinary share capiEal of the lompany. i The retiring directors, Mr. D. A Davies, MP., Xr. KRindersicy, MIr. D. Dews, and Mr. Eliot Macnaghten weni' re-elected, as wvas also Mr. A. ,acgregor, the auditor,* 'wi> retirel by rotation, andthe proceedings terminated. EAST KENT. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern; Lord Sondes -was in the d air. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in Time Tilu s> was taken as read. The CusnnL-ie, in moving the adoption of the report, said that the document so fully and clea-ly put them iD. possession of the state of the company that it 'WaS unnecessary for bins to offer muore than a vesy few observations. He thought it mnst be exceedingly gratifying to the propnietors tolearn that the progress niade during the past half-yearmis the 'orks at lochester-bridge had been saisfactory; that the foundations wvere completed, and a. considerable portion of the superstructure finished and. deliveredatP.ochester. (Cheers.) Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co., Mr. Burge, Mr. Morris, and Mr. CramptoA proposedto enter mtoa contract for constructing all the works upon the East Kent Railvway, between Strood and Dover, ol the trms of the cents-act entered into 'nitli Messrs Fox, Henderson, and Co., on the 19th of July, 1S55, fer the line between Strood and Canterbmuy. They proposeA1 to execute the works in sections, tunder the orders of the company's engineer-viz., from Strood ttaFaversham, fron Favershan to Cantcebur-y, amsd from Canterbury to Dover, beginning, in the first u:stance, with only a single line of wav, nith all necessamy -works for a double line to Faversham, . nd s, complete ib;.t section in 12 or 15 months, They agreed to taxke half of the first 200,000L of works in shares, so that, with a contribution of 100,000. by the compary, 200,000L. would he expended, and the compauy get the line open to Pavershanm tfrough this expenditure and a simall exercise of the borrowing powers. They also proposed to enter into a - arrangement for taldng a working lease of the line for 21 years, and to provide all necessary rolling stock at prices to be agreed on for payingan annual rent sof 5 per cent., with half profits beyond G per cent., and also paying a per cenft interest on the share capital employed during the conAsruction of the wvorks. The performance of the contlraet was to be secured by the deposit of 20,0300 He then njioved the adoption of the repost and accounts. MSr. LUSnznecON seconded the motion. In reply to a question, it was stated by the solicitor 'that' no loan had been made to Mr. Sadleir. but that a -nm Al amount was owing by the Clonluel Bank to t'e comoastybut that there was no reason to suppose the whole a i; would not be repaid. Sir J. TYLDEx gave his hearty support to tfe ltiopoe's arrangements with the contractors. After some observations from several propric-tovs. w;'o cordially approved of the proposed contract, the report xsas ulnauimously adopted, and resolutions vcere pastctl san provig the proposed anangements for complenting The line, and re-electing the retiring directors and aQdit,-r.

THE BRITISH MUSEU3r. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T=rES. Sir,-The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated last night (Thursday); in reply to a question from Mr. Heywood, that the Government would not interfere in the management of the British Museum, because the commissioners had not been unanimous in their report presented to the House of Commons in 180. The words of the report (see page 10) are- " TFith 2 espect to thc ececutive vuunagenzent, your cornvissioners are unaninously of opi?ion that a cMange shou&l be adopted, involving the abolition, of the offices of principal libraiian and of secretary as they 71w exls4, and the establishnzent of a responsible execztire council." It is worthy of remark that the italics are the commissioners' own, and that these words are the only ones italicized in the entire reported 44 folio pages. The public might reasonably expect that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should refer to public documents correctly. I am. Sir, Your obedient servant. VERAX. Friday, Feb. 29.
THE MABIAA GE AcT. TO TBE EDITOR OF THE TI3MES. Sir,-You report a case of a most extraordinary marriage of a Mrs. Major Campbell at the office of the superintendilg registrar of the Marylebone District, and conclude with a question, " whether the state of our marriage law is satisfactory, and whether it is not a scandal to a civilized country that the institution of marriage, which %vbss intended for the protection of the offspring of the wife, should be capable of being perverted to its ruin." I assure you most extraordinary marriages do take place under the New Marriage Act. I am rector of Little Oakley, and a guardian in the Ketteing Union, and am constantly hearing the secretary reading intended marriages, and passing them off without any notice whatever being taken of them; and, as the reading takes place at the comnencernent of business, there are very often only three guardians present. A year or tvo ago I heard read an intended marriage between a father and daughter-in-law, both my parishioners. I immediately forbade it, whereupon the secretary claimed of me'5s., according to law ! (a hard case on clergymen with Emall livings). I, however, paid it, and set the marnia e aside; situated as I was 'with respect to the parties, I would have paid the fine had it been ol., or I could not conscientiously have gene on with my parish duties. But I set aside the illegal marriage only for a short time. The father and daughter-in-law went to Northampton, and were there easily united under the new act. They returned home and had one child. The woman, from compunction of conscience, ran away from the father duplicate, and is now far awvay from him, in respectable service ; but the duplicate father says he vill have nothing to do with the child-the marriage was illegal, and nobody can malke hinn keep it. T sol q;, --ur +rnl J. L. SUTTON. WSeekey Vicarage, jetterimg, Zeb. 2. TO THE EDITOPL OF THE TIhES. Sir,-An article in Tlee Times of February the 27th has led mie to send you a few lines on the marriages at the superintending rbgistrar's office. I am a guardian, and at our meetings once a fortnight all notices of marriage are read over. There is no power to stop a marriage. We have had in our union many marriages of minors, and I recollect one where the boy was 19 and the girl 15. - Last week a woman published bans between herself and a man who knew nothing whatever of her intentions, and, being upwards of 70, might easily have been entrapped some timne during the three months that the certificate remains good. It was fortunate that a guardian happened to be present whio knewsomething of the case. This mode of marriage gives every opportunity for claudestine proceedings;* but, although I*save found fault 'with the act of Farliamnent as it now stands, I hardly know what remedy to suggest; but surelv it should be brought before the public, who were scarcely asked their opinion when the act was passed.

- IRBELND. T U RISH JUTDICIAL MJI. fBY ELEcTRTCt TF.-F.I'ZV APTr- DTTELIN. FRTT)Av Vv? - The grand jury of the county of Longford have presented addresses of sympathy to the three Irish Judges whose names were mixed up in the recent di-scussion upon ,Sir John Shelley's motion, and to which each of their Lordabips has given a reply. Baron Pennefathcr in the course of his answer says "It is true that I have been favoured with health and strength rarely enjoyed by a person of my years, and that, as far as I can judge, my mental faculties are undiminished; but these are blessings which no mortal can comnnand the enjoyment of They are in the disposal of Him who orders everything for the best; the youngest and strongest may, at HiswiU,be deprivedofaUthatheprizesmost. At my age of 82 I cannot hope for a very long enjoyment of these blessings, but Ihave alwaysthoughtthatwhilethe enjoyment of them is permitted, andso long, and nolonger, asIam able to discharge my duties efficienily and to the satisfaction of the public, I ought to testify my gratitude by a diligent and anxious discharge of those duties, arid not cast an increased burdenonthat public, which the consequence of my retirement would entail." Judge Torrens says " In common with aU of you, and I believe with the wellthinldng part of the community, I deplore the late proceedings in the Lower House of Parliament, by which the independence of the Irish bench of judges was so unconstitutionally assailed. I have, however, the consolation of believing that the result will disappoint the object of the pro3moters of the measure, and ,that it wil appear from that result that the Irish bench during a long series of years has discharged its various and onerous duties with diligence, impartiality, and fidelity." The Lord Chief Justice remarks "It is not for me to say with what discretion statements have been made in the House of Commons, which the official returns, when laid on the table, must utterly fail to establish. But though I cannot suffer personally, I deeply regret, on public grounds, that any gentleman, influenced, as he stated, by a regard to the due administration of justice in Leland, should have taken a course which, if unfounded, is calculated to bring, not only the judges of the land, but the administration of justice itself, into contempt." THE LATE FAILURE OF THE TIPPERARY BARK. In the Court of Exchequer to-day a Aiotion was made on behalf of Ar. Blackett, agent of Lord Bessborough, against MIr. James Sadleir, as public agent of the Tipperary Bank, to have service of the summons and plaint already had deemed good service. The action was for the recovery of 2,8271. 15s. 4d., which had been lodged in the Carrick-onSuir branch, and is one of the first legal proceedings of this nature which has been taken in relation to the late extensive defalcations. The Court granted thenmotion.
- POLICE. dSIos-nosUSE.Jslmohn il,"who had been remanded on several occasions on the charge of having had in his possession some bars of gold, supposed to be part of, a large quantity of bullion sto en in its transit from London to l'aris in the month of May last, was brought before the LORD MAYOR for further examination. iMr. J. Johnson, goldrefiner, of Alderasgate-street, said-1 purchased gold of a person of the name of Reuben Hlart, on the loth of July last, for which I paid him 1971. Us. 2d. ; on the 23d of July, 1941. 3s. 9d. ; on the 30th of July, 1061. Os. 7d.; on the lst of August, 1531. 13s. 9d.; on the 13th of August, 1111. lls. 6d. ; and the 17th of August, 691. Ss. 3d. The 1111. lls. 6d. I paid in a check for 601. on Mr. Montague. On the 17th of Angust I gave him a check for 691. lSs. 3d. on Messrs. Montague and Co. The quality of gold varied. I knew Reuben Hart. I saw him last about a month ago. I have not seei him since the prisoner was taken into custody. Mr. S. Montague, 21, Cornhill, said-Johnson and Walker are in the habit of drawing upon me. I produce a clheckl of theirs, dated August13, 1855. Ipaid it in lOnotesonthe following day. On the 17th of August I paid a check for 697. lSs. 3d., in part payment of which sum I gave six 101.- not-es. Mr. R. Bayley, a clerk in the Bank of England, produced 11 101.-notes, on one of which was written, "John Hall, 1, Peter-street, Hackney-road," and on another the name of " Stubbs." The notes were received at the Bank on the 31st of August in exchange for other notes. Mr. J. Thurston' stockbroker, of Tokenhouse-yard, said, -In August last I made a purchase of Turkish scrip for rx. I. Davies, 1,0007. Four per Cents. for 4731. 15s. He gave me 9251. in notes and the rest in gold. (The witness gave the numbers of the notes.) On the 29th of October I made another purchase for Mr. Davies of Turkish scrip, for which he paid me in notes. (Thewitnessgavethe numbers of these notes also.). - R. Davies.-I live at 23, Brunswick-place, Ball's-pondroad. I employed Mr. Thurston to purchase some Turkish scrip in October last. I was acting under the direction of the prisoner, and received the notes from him, which I paid M1r. Thursten. The prisoner was again remanded. BoNv-srRET.-On \Mr. JARDxE taking his seat on th bench this morning, the summoning officer, Blunden, reported the-result of inquiries he had been directed to make in reference to a woman named Ann Kirby, who appEed for relief from the poorbox on the last occasion when his worship sat in this court. This woman represented herself as a needlewoman, and said she was also possessed of considerable talent as an artist. She was at present in great distress, the result of illness and other misfortunes. For some time she had been an inmate of an institution for the relief of distressed needlewomen, in Newman-street, Oxford-street, and had been provided with work by the society; but, according to the rules, she was disqualfied from receiving more than temporary relief, being a wvidow,with three chiildren, whereas the institution wasmainly designed for the relef of single women. She produced letters of recommendation from several respectable persons, who appeared to he impressed with a high opion of her character. Having leit the nstitution, she and her children were homeless and withoat food. Still she could easily obtain employment if she could only get into a respectable lodgiog. She had seen one whichwould suit her, but she mst paya deposit of Ss.,. beingthe amount of oneeeksrent, and then she would require a few shillings for a small quantity of feed and firing to begin w1ith. The worthy magistrate instructed Blunden to inquire into the truth of her story, and, if he found that thefacts were as she stated, to tell the landlord that he (Mr. Jardinel would answer for the payment of the firAt week's rent. Hfis worship also gave the officer a discretionary authority to lay out afew shilligs in coals and necessaries for her, but not to give her the money. Blunden now stateg that from the moment of leaving the court the woman showed great anxiety to get possession of the morkey which he of course refused to give her. On inquiry at the place where she said she was about to take lodgings, he found that no deposit had been demanded, but, at the same time, the landlady had no disposition to receive her as a lodger, havingat the first interview been ofiended by the strong smell of gin upon her breath. Finding her statement thus contradicted at the very outset, he did not feel that he should be justified in applying the money for her benefit, and ho accordingly now returned it -to his worship. I Mr. Jardine wrould refer to the list of night charges, he would find-the name of this woman, who wras in custody- for drunkenness. M4r. JAaiDrsx said Blunden had acted rightly in reserving. the 'money under the circumstances. In the course of the morning the woman in question was brought up in. custody of Policeman F 35, charged with being drunk and creating a disturbanee at the door of the stationhouse at about 2 -o'clock in the ynorning. Mr. Mare, the chief usher, drew his worship's attention to the fact that the same woman was brought before Mr. Hall for drunkenness on ionday. imr. JSADpm remarked upon the impudence of the prisoner's conduct in applyingforreief to one magistrate the day after being charged with drunkenness before another at the same court. It was fortunate that he had not, under the impression produced by her plausible story and her specious testimonials, ganted eh r relef without inquiry, to the injury of the really deserving. He would take care to apprise the persons of whom she had obtained letters how completely they had been imposed pon, and he would also give notice to the magistrates at other courts lest she should deceive them, as she had attempted to deceive him. She might now be discharged. Another case of attempted' imposture was brought under the notice of the Court, in the form of a charge of shoplifting, against two women, named Johanna Cottler and Ann Corbey. Mr. JAmDT'E said, the public had little idea of the frauds and wickedness of: persons like the prisoners, who went about with petitions and certificates mostly false, as in this case they were acknowldeged to be, and the bearers themselves generally thieves, ready to pilfer the first thing they could lay hands on; He should convict the prisoners summarily, and sentence themtowomnh ipsnet wsith bard lacour. to twomonthe imprisonment L,10MBETIH.-Air.

The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was possessed oE t.he manor of Hatfield, and thathe vas entitled to the fisheryof the niver TIa within thatnmanor, and also to the soil oE thebedof the xiver, and it went onto state that- the defens dant had committed a trespass by pulling up weeds and re. moving a quantity of the soil of the river, ana had thereby inmre the plaintiff's right of fishery. l The defendant had placed a great number of pleas upon the record, and among them was one alleging that he -was possessed-of a certza ancient mill uon the river, and that hew was entitled to se the water for thepurposes of the mill; and that -what he had done was merely with that object. The cause occupied the Court for severil hours, but the nature of the action maybe gatheredfrom the above outline of the pleadings. The noble marquis, it appeared, claimed the exclusive right to the fishing of. the river -within his manor, and the trespass complained of consisted in the defendant, who is the tenant nuder Lord Palmerston of a mill upon the Brocket-ha7l estate, which it appears is within the manor of Hatfield, caled Limpsford-mnill, having removed some logs from the bed of the river that were pliced there by order of the plaintiff to prevent poachers from netting-the fish, and also a quantity of gravel and weeds. The learned counsel for the plaintiff entered at some length into the details of the case, and he stated in the course of his speech that, although it might at first be calculated to create some prejudice, when the relative conditions of the plaintiff and the defendant were considered, he in reality believed that Mr. White -was only a nonminal defendant, and that the action was in point of fact defended by Lord and Lady Pahmnerston, -who -were the owvners of the property. HIe, at the samne time, said that the marqulis of lShaLbury did not seek any damages for the act that had been commnitted, and the only o'o.ect he had in institnting these proceedings waso protect his own zrights, and preserve themin the same condintion for his successors as t.hey had been enjoyed by limself and his ancestors. The case on the part of the plaintiff consisted of a good deal of documentary evidence, from which it appeared t-hat the manor had been oriinally granted by King James L to his ancestor, Robert, Earl of Salisbury, in 1607, and it had ever since been in possession of the family of the noble maram, h0fo himself succeeded to the title and estate uponthe his father in 1822. It -was proved that the mar. qtuis had always claimed the exclusive right of fishing il the river throughout the whole extent of the manor, and that nersons had been moved off -vho were found fishing vrithout leave, and several had been fined. It -was also shown that a former tenant of the millin question, who had removed a portion of gravel from the bed of the river, had been complained of, and that he paid the sum of 21. 14s. as the value of the gravel he had removed, and the surveyor of the roads of the neighbouring parish of Essenden had also paid money for gravel under similar circmnstances. Itj was then proved, that upon tvwo occasions persons acting by the orders of the defendant had removed grave'l and weeds from the bed of the river, and it was stated that in consequence of these proceedings the fish had deserted that part of the river, not being able to find their usual shelter. Serjeant SnE, in his address to the jury for the defendant, observed upon the fact that the case of the noble marquis with respect to the exclusive right to the fishery appeared to rest entirely upon the evidence of dependents and persoas who were in his service, and that no one in the condition of a gentleman, a clergyman, or any one person possessing property in the neighbourhood, had been called to support this part of the case. H'e should not, however, dispute the fact that there -was evidence to show that the Marquis of Salisbury had a right to the fishery of the iver, and probably to the soil of the bed, but the case he was instructed +o set up on behalf of the defendant was, thatthe mill in question had existed a great number of years, and that it had been the practice of every one of the persons who had occupied lt to clear the river at certain periods of the weeds and gravel that had accumulated on it, and unless this was done the mill would stop altogether. The defendlant, he should show, had only done nhIat it mas the usual practce to do, and he had removed no more soil from the riverthanvwas necessary to obtain a sutficient depth of water to enable him to vwork his mill, and he said that if he made out this fact to their satisfaction he would, irrespective of any question relating to the right of fishing or the ownership of the of the bed of the river, be antled to their vertiet. Baron ALDnEnsoN, at the close of the speech of the learned ssrjeant, said that, having heard the nature of the defence that was to be set up, it appeared to him that the m3atter wouldbe settledin a much more satisfactory manner by the parties coming to some arrangement between themselves an by taking the opinion of the jury. All the defendant appeared to desire was to be able to keep the riverin such a condition as to work his mill, andhe imagined that there could be no difficulty upsn that point. Mr. BovmL said he was instructed to state, on the pat of the Marquis of Salisbury, that he desired to grant him. every facility, and he had no other object than to protect; his own rights, and tale care that the fishery was not destroyed, which it would be if such proceedings as those complained of were allowed to be carried on. A long conversation then took place between the learnel counsel on both sides, and at length it -aes stated that an arrangement had been come to by -which the defendant was to be permitted to clear the river for a certain distance, the plaintiff at the same time undertaking to clear it for a further distance, sufficient to provide the proper anount of -water for the working of the mill, the defendant acknowledging the right of the plaintiff to the fishery and the soil of the bed of the river, and agreeing to pay 20s. a-year as an ucknowledgment of thattitle. The jury were then discharged without giving a verdict.
NOThR.TTr T r.Tpr,7f p NEWVCAST=E. Fi. 28. .ur. -Baron -lartin and 2Kr. Justice Willes arrived in this town, from Carlisle, last night. Their Lordships having heard divine service in the Old Church this morning, Mr. Baron3fartin took his seat in the Guildhall, to try the townr prisoners, anid :l-r. Justice Willes in the Moot-hall, to try the county prisoners. The town calendar contains the hames of U prisoners, one charged vwith an attemnpt to murder, the restwith minor offences. The county calendar contains the names of ll prisoners, of whom seven are charged -with being concerned in a murder, two with rape, and the rest with cutting and woundiLg with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The entry in the cause list is not yet known, but it is beEeved to be very hght. (BeforeAfsr. Baron URTnP, at thc Guildlhall.) PatrickIDurkin, alias Kelly, aced 21, was indicted for having on the. 29th of =ovember last, on the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, stolen 41 and a leather pur-se from the person of James Crak Mr. Greenwood prosecuted, and Mffr. Plice defended the prisoner. The prosecutor, it appeared, is the sergeant-at-mace of thecorporation of Berwick-on-Tweed, and on the 28th of tovember last he left London, accompanied by his daughter, in a sterauvessel, for Berwick. Mext morning he was seated in the fore cabin, feeling very sick, and he fancied a, bottle of porter would do him good. He accordingly ordered one, and pilled out his purse to pay for it. The prisoner was also a passenger on board the vessel; and seated next to him. In paying for the porter the prosecutor opehed his purse, and owing to the rocking of the vessel, and his own condition, the prisoner had ample opportunity of noting the contents of the purse. The porter did not agree wtith the prosecutor qmte so well as he expected, and he turned aside very sick. Recovering from this paroxyslm he instinctively, for no reason that lhe could tell, put his hand on his pocket to feel his purse, but found it gone. He suspected the prisoner because he had been seated next to him and followed him np the gangway. The prosecutor forgetting his sickness in his lORS, made a great outcry about his purse and money, and charged the prisoner with -stealig them, which he s outly denied. The captain seems then to have doubted whether this wa,s not a r usc of the sergeant-at-mace to avoid paying his passage-money, and threatened to stop the luggage of himnself and daughter unless he was paid for their passage. The prosecutor, rendered desperate by this threat, insisted on searching -the prisoner, which he did in one of the cabins, strip ping him 'ite naked, but found nothing on him -but a few shillings and a post-office order for 21. The prosecutor, however, still insisted that the prisoner must have the money somewhere, and the rest of the passengers, not lildng this appearance of things, joined in the outcry against the prisoner, whom they resolved to try. Accordingly, they formed themselves into a jury, and ap. pointed a judge, called on the prosecutor to state his case, and put the prisoner on his triaL The prisoner then pronsed that if they would not iluse him and expose him we vould maLe the money up to the prosecutor, and would pay the passage-money of both him and his daughter. This was taken as an unquestionable admission of guilt, and thereupon the prisoner, ainid many strong execrations was unanimously pronounced to be guilty by bis triers, and the judge sentenced him to be executed. A rope -was obtained and put round his neck, and the other end having been carried over a beam, his triers " with a will " ran him upto the top, and very nearly carried the sentence into effect, for the prisoner's eyes were described as starting out of his head when he was let down. On being let down he promised to pay the whole amount if they would not further iUuse him. On the vessel arriving at its destination he was given into custody on the present charge. The money and purse had not been found, and the prisoner was supposed to haxe throNn them overboard on being charged with the theft. For the defence it was contended that the evidence against hin rested only on the suspicions of the prosecutor, and that the promises to make good the amount, which were taken to be admiissions of his guilt, were extorted from him by fear of the mockl tial and of the treatment he was about to receive, which was no mockery so far as he was concerned. His LOPDsnn' having summed up the evidence, The jury, after some consideration, Acquittcd the prisoner. He was discharged by his Lordship with a caution, and it was then stated that he was a ticlket-of-leave mal.
