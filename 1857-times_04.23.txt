BXrBAOBDINARY TrBAL. TNVRRARVY ApTtr. 17 (Before Lords HANDYSIDE and ARDUMILAI.) lReotor M'Donsld, labourer, 32, was charged with the nur4ter of Jane Seaton, or ll'Donald, his wife. The nature of the cam wfill be gathered from the evidence of the chief witnesses. Christina M'Donald, or Seaton, an old wornan, A widow, from Kirkapoll, being sworn, deposed in Gaelic, through the interpreter :-I had a daughter named Jane. She died on the morning of the 12thof February last. She was between 24 and 25 years of age. Previous to her death she had been married to the prisoner at the bar for three years and one month, and had two children. She was going about in perfect health on the day before she died. She was a strong young woman. The prisoner and deceased did not agree. The younger child is now about a year old. Neither of the children is baptised, and prisoner denied that they were his children. PIisoner and his wife lived .nder the same roof with me,-s wooden partition separated the two houses. That partition only reached to the top of the side walls, not to the roof of the house. The prisoner and his wife slept in their own end of the house, while I slept at the other. I have a son named John. Me was sometimes since last New Yeaes-day sleeping in my house. It was a straw bed the prisoner and his wife slept on. The straw was spread on the groaund, with eight stones laid along eutside to keep the straw in its place. These stones were about the size of a mass hat. The prisoner was at horas on the evening of the 12th of February last, whero he generaUy was. His wife came home that evening about the time of lighting candles. She said she had been that day at :Baephetrish, a good mile distant. She eame home quite well, and took a smaU bowl full of slpper, consisting of thin porridge, made of whelks and oatmeal. That mel was not common to her; it was the first time she had taken it that year. Prisoner and his wifo went to bed that night between and 9 o'clock. I heard them scolding before going to bed. She said, " Hector, keep the child (the younger) or else make the bed ;" and then, Shortly afterwards, ' Oh! you have killed the boy " and he answered, " Then raise or lift you the boy.' The wife said, " Yes, I will do so when I bring downthe crr;ie lht)from myoother's." He then got up, and put his bac to the end of his own house, and said, "You have said to many a person that I have thrashed you; saythe fourth part again, and hell tomy soul, I vill crush you." Aftr they went to bed I went to bed also. There was a door which entered directly through tho partiton fromrth one house to the other. I was sittingin my own house when I heari the conversation referred to, and tha door was open. Prisonerswife came into mIo hoe andtook the light and went back to her ownhouse. i heard distinctly what was going on in their apartment, and I got up to speak to -the pnsoner when r heard him use the oaths, and said, " HIector, I am going to get trustworthy pcople in the house to hear you making use of that langrage, so as to be able to bear witness against you." He answered, "Little do I care what you do, old woman. Go awayand seek them, the door is open." I then said to him "II think I will just put this mht along with the other nights; I am in the habit of hearng such language." He said to me a second time, " Go away, what do I care about what you or the people of the place say?" I then went to bed, and took the: elder of the two children along with me. The younger slept with its father and mother. My son John was not in the house when I went to bed. I heard him come in afterwards, about 10 o'clock. He had not to pass through the prisoner's house to get to my house. There is an outer door and a partition door; and on entering the ou'Ler door I turn to the left to enter my house. When my son John entered the house I heard my daughter (prisoner's wife) say, " Is that you, John 7" Ho answered, "Yes." She said, "Wherehave you been e" and he said, "In a neighbour's." She asked, " What o'clock is it P and he answered, "A About 10 o'dock, as they were preparng supper when I left." John slept that night in the same bed with myself, where he always lay. John and I fell asleep. I was awakened during the night by hearing the prisoner moving through the house. I caUled, *Is that you, Hector P" andhe answered " It is." I said no more, and he went to bed ater thai. I then heard prisoner's wife say to him, "Let the clothes overme and over the child." I cried, " If your wife and child are cold, Hector, take them into your bosom; you got your wife with a good character." His wife then said. "M Mother, that is not the way ho is to-night at all. He has not spoken since we went to-bed." I said, " Oh, Hector, did you go to-bed in auger, and keep it up there 7" Neither the prisoner nor his wife said awordafter this. This would be after 12 o'clock. I then fell asleep. About daybreak I heard a noise as if the outer door had fallen down. I remained in bedtill I heard a second sound or stroke like to a heavy bag falling out of a cart on to the ground. This noise came from the floor of the prisoner's house, and from whero the straw bed was. The house has an earthen floor. I got up and went to prisoner's endoE thehouse, and openedthe partition door, and there saw the prisoner standing on the floor with his shoes, trousers, and braces on. I don't know whether he had those on when he went to bed, but if he hal it was unusual. He had his wife (my daughter) in his arms, with her shift on, and his hands were either at her throat or opposito her heart, I cannot say which. Her head rested on his left shoulder, and his head leant over her head, and she had a small shawl on horhead. Isaid, "0 God! whatis hero?' Mydaughter made no answer. The prisoner said, " Jane has fallen." I asked, 0 God I what is here " Xasmy heart was frightened from the language he had used before going to bed. I said to him, "Let go my danghter," and he answered me, "I wont." Then mn, son John, who was behind me, said, "1 Let goJane, Hector. or"Lethergo, Hector." frisonerthenlet her go, and she fell down on the floor. [Here the witnues came out of the witness-box to the centre of the court floor in front of the bench to give practical illustration of the manner in which her deceased daughter had fallen on the night in question. Witness there made a staggering circular movement, and fell softly on the court floor on her face, and uttered a low, deep moan, and the solemn aud dramatic effect of the scene made a deep impression on the Court.] She resumed,-My daughter did not rise till my son John end I raksed her, and John said, I" Hector, come and hel us; -we cannot raise her; she is heavy " and prisoner did come to help us. When we lifted her prisoner wished her put into his own bed, but I refused, and we took her into my bed in myapartment. John and I carried her there, and I cannot say whether Hector amsisted us or no', but he was there. We laid her down on hor side on my bed. I ut my tongue to her throat to feel if she was breathing, and took the shawl off her face and her eyes were coming out, as if they were started out of their sockets (sensation) ; and I pushed them back with both ny hands. I said, " Dearest of women, if you can speak, and have your senses, do so. It is in your mother's two arms that you are." When I said this she four times opened and shut her lips with a very slght smack, and I put my ear to her mouth, and she muttered softly "Coup" (Gaelic, cup), and I thought she wanted water. I gave her about half a cupful of water. I put it into her mouth, bat I do not think any of it went over, as it ran out of her mouth. About two minutes after this she pressed the points of her fingers very tigh together, and muttered something like " my poor c 3dren." She appeared to die then, and said no more. I think from the tume she was carried " ben" till the time she died would be about ten minutes. It was daylight at the time she died, The prisoner was then in his own end of the house. I said to my son John, " Go for my sister, for Jane is dead " and prisoner said, " If you wiU let me up I will know whether she is dead or not." I said, "How will you know whether she is dead or not better than I do ?" and he said " I will know ;" and I said, " Come down, then." PriZoner felt her throat, and then he lifted his hands and exclaimed, " Oh, Tho I she is dead. I will go into the cea." Interrogated.-Did he say anything more? Witness,-I said, "Yoa will not go out into the sea. You wil remain and take care of your two sons. They require nursing, and I cannot attend to them; I am too weak. I reouire to be nursed myself to-day." Interrogated.-.Did he say anything more? Writnessa-I do not recollect whether he said anything> more or not. Did he say anything at that time about his wife having had the bowel complaint ?-No. My son John went for my sister and Mary 'Donald, aud they came with him. I do not l-now what hour it was then, but it was earlier than the usual time at which people get out of bed. My sister Mary proceeded to get the body washed when she came. It was the prisoner himself who held the body while Mary washed it. H3e ssaid he would do so. He put a board down over the window, which is used to let out the smoke; and he put his back against the glass window, and took the body on his knees. While the washing wes going on I heard prisoner say, " Mary, turn back and wash this part again." Mty head was blt down, and I did not see hm pointto any particular place, and I do not know whether so or not. After my daughter died, and before the body was washed, I did not hear the prisoner say anything as totho causeof oher death. He said that morning, when may son went away for my sister, " Wifee," meamg me, "should not we have the funeral aler breakfast to. morrow t" and I said, " Yes, as soon as a wright can make the coffin." The prisoner and my son John went awar to the PoOr's inspector to get a coffin between 12 and 2 o'clock. A coffin was got on Saturday, and sbe was buried late on Saturday evening. When the body was being washed that day I observed black and blue marks about deceased's throat and thereabouts. When Mr. 3'Quarrie, Dr. Wilson, Alexauder Cameron, and others came on Friday I saw marks on the back of deceased. I did not assist in washing the body because I could not do it for my feeliDgs. I have a brother named Malcolm M'Donald, who lives on the other side of the island, and b came on Thursday evening and saw the body. lIe went and got Dr. Wilson, who came on Friday morning. Mr. bEQuarrie and Mlalceim MI'Neil came along with him, and they all saw the body. It had never been meddled with from the time of washing it tiU the time they came. The prisoner was taken into custody be- tween 3 and 4 o'clock on Friday. On the night of Wednesday, when my daughter returned from Balephetrish, I did not hear her cormplain of having cold shiverings Cross-examined by Mr. Moncrieff.-Th prisoner and his wife came to live in the same hous wihe the last time, shortly before New Year's-day last He had been living there before and left it, and then Mr 'Qnarrie, the factor, ordered him to come back. He left the first time because he0 was not pleased with the house, adhe made a small hut for himself, and went there to lv.The hut was not higher than the court table. It was not against nmy will that ho came to live with me the last time; I was g Vee wihing that he should come. Sometimes we agreed w19 but he was always grumbling and complaining. Iterrogated.-Was his wife attached to tho prisoner? Witness.-She could not well be, for if they agreed in the mnorning he would be grumbling with her at night, and she with him. He had her four times in three years before the Kirk Session. I never saw prisoner strike his wife, but he was very often threatening to strikeO her. Interrogated.-Did tho prisoner ever inform the factor that you were selling whisky without a license ? Witness.-He told so to the constable. I was oin to Glasgow, and prisoner gavo me money to feteh hlira homo two pints of whisky, and I adi so, and a summons of re- moving was twice served on me for having brought the. whisky to the island. The prisoner told the factor that I bad brought the whisky without telling himthat it had been brougt rorhimself. I had never heard of a prohibition aainet bring,ing whisky to the island, and I did not think there was anything vrong in bringing it there. These sum- mia# of removal were serve& on momill the springf ear. The factor did not ak me to remuove, althoug t-, been servedwith the stAnnons, bitit w ax a atM_o ilatd that any ohe bringing whisky into theislamd , 1 be served with such a summoLs The 1 niwmona sgAim me was not carried into effect.

I was never olled on to attend her in a medical capciy. She was. apparently a healthy wroman. I firs heard o her death on Thursday, the 12th of Febr,ry, about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. I was asked to go to tbe house on the morning of the 13th by 'Neil the inapector of poor. I went-ad saw the body, whichwasld out on a bed in the house of her mother. desired the prisoner, who was present, to remove the covering, and I looked at the body, which was warm at the sides. ik the first instanCe Imade an external examination. This led me to go to the nearest magistrate and state the relt. That was between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I obtained warrants from A justice to authorize an iuspectoA of the body and also to apprehend the prisoner. Armed with these wramnts I made a regular poet mortm examination. The prisoner was taken into custody. It got dark that day before I had completed my examination, and I left the body in charge of Malcolm M'Donald tiU the following day, and I then completed my examination, and I made a report, which I now produce. Witness readthe re rt, which was lengthy, ana in substnce embodied the fo lowing:-There was an abrasion on each aide of thewind. pipe, fiveabrasdonson the left arm, three on the right arm 14ontheback rtofthechest; theakin onthefiontana sides of the nec, and also that on the upper pazt of the chest over the breastbone, was of a black ap=ence; the skin on part of the chest had also a lack appearance. The bloodvessels in the membranes of the brain, as also in the substance of the brain, were more injected than usual. The right side of the heart contained a quantity of dark flulid blood; the left side wag nearly empty. The lun contained a quantity of dark fluid blood; the visoer presentedL a heathy appearance. It was furtber reported as a general inference Iroin the examination, that death had been caused by strangulation by the grwp of. a hand. The body was buried that same evening about dusk. It was afterwards exhumed, and examined on Friday, the 20th, b' Dr. WCoI1, of Tobermory, and myself. I then exammned the body, and adheredto my reports of examinations of the 13th and 14th, as to the cause of death. Dr. X'Coll also. made a report founded on that examination, which weat to show that death might have been caused by srangulation. The marks might have been the result of graspinn, eiter during sleep or while awake. It appears to me th;at the grasp had been made at the throat by the left hand, which reft the rmarks of the thumb and the fingers, and that the heel of the hand had been pressed down on the breastbone. Iappliedmyownhandto the parts to see if the marks corresponded to a thumb and fingers, and they did so. While I thought the left hand had been thus employed, I thought the nght hand of the assailant had been employed in grasping the left mn of the attacked person. It is consistent with in.y observatiorn that if the compression hal been made durtng sleep, or even while awake, the loss of speech would be the result, It is impossible that the violence could have been inflicted by the decesed person heiself. I asked the prisoner the first day I went to the house, and before I had obtained a warrant against him how he could account for those marks, and he answered that he could not account for them. I saw no appearance of dise about thebowels. There was no trace of inflammaition on anypart of the deoeased tnternally to account for any complant of the bowels during the night preceding death. All the marks of violenoe I saw on the body were marks that had been inficted during life. There were rows of stones on the floor round the straw of the bed on which the prisoner and hi s wife had lain, and I could not account for the injuries on the back, except by the deceased falling upon or rubbing against thee atones. From the chest bemig so much blackened I inferred that deceased must have been in a recumbent position when violence was used. The marks on the throat were not such as might bave been inDicted by a person fallng on the edge of a tub-quite different. The marks on the arms might not have been observed shortly after being received, as discolouration is) not the immediate result of violence. From all the observations I have made I have no doubt whatever that death took place by strangu lation. I am helpod to this conclusion from the internal appeances being indicative of asphyxia, or a cessation of the heart's action, in consequence of suspension or interrupthon of respiration-in short, choking. Some exculpatery evidence having been given, The AIwvocAm-sDzpiJr briefly addressedi the jury, and was followred by rulr. MoNcnrYsC, in an able defence; after wrhich Lord HAN.YsM summed up in a touching and luminous address to the jury, in which he minutely went over the whole evidence. The jury then retired for half an bour, and returned into court with a verdict unanimously finding the prisoner Guilty of culpable homicide. Lord HAfDysrmr regarded the crime of which the prisoner bad been found guilty as culpable homicide in the fighef degree, and pronounced sentence of trsnsportation

PEONZY-MARKET and CITY IZTELLIGBNCB. Wednesday Evening. The ftnds continue firm, and have again closed tfo-day at an advance of an eighth. Consols for money were first quoted 93 to t, and the last prices -were 93i to i for money, and 931 to i for the account. The market was supported by some purchases on account of the Court of Chancery, and also by the circumstance that loans are still freely offered on Government securities at 6 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92; 1!lew Three per Cents., 92 to i; India Stock, 220 to 223 ; Exchequer-bonds, 9S4 to i, India Bonds, -8s. to 4s. discount; and Exchequer-boils (June) 4s. to 2s. discount, (MIarch) 3s. discount to par. In the discount-market the demand was moderate. Foreign securitiea have not exhibited great variation, but prices generaUy were supported with firmness. In Turkish Six per Cents. the operations were at 941. The other transactions comprisedaBrazilian Five per Cents., 10IO; Danish ThreeI per Cents., 85 and 85i; Ecuador New Consoli- I dated, 144 ; Mexican, for account, 234 ; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91; Spanish New Deferred, for money, 25k; for the account, 25g and 4 ; Spanish Certificates, 6' Dutch Two-and-a-Halr per Cents., 65k, i, and and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 97. The corn-market this morning was steady at the rates of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 30c. for money and 69f. 35c. for the end of the month, showing a little less heaviness. The Russian railway shares were quioted to-day at ito I premiim, the fictitious demand from Vienna and elsew7here being sufficient to keep them nomimally at that price, although it would disappear instantly if any large number were offered. Notwithstanding the fact of the scheme being unanimously discountenanced by all the leading firms in the city, it is to be assumed the proposed 2,000,0001. will be subscribed, since doubtlFes Messrs. Baring, as the London agents of the Russian Government, before they intimated to St. Petersburg their readi;ess to offer that reduced amount made arrangements for its being taken, either temporarily or on such other coniditions as might seem expedient. Some further continental orders for investment of a .haracter similar to those already mentioned Pre ascertained to have been received by one or two of ths principal firns in the Stock-Exchange. The terms of Sir Morton Peto's contract for the Portuguese Railway from Lisbon to Oporto are stated in the accounts from Lisbon received this morning. The line is to be completed in four years, and the Government are to pay to the company 8,8501. per mile towards its cost as each section is completed. The concession is for 99 years, the Government reserving the privilege of taking it into tleir own hands on payment of a sum equal to the profits of 14 years, and also of levying a tax of o per cent. per annum on the gross receipts. For the works already construieted on the portion of the line between Lisbon and Santarem the company are to pay 5,6551., and the Government undertake to pay off at their full value the claims of the previous shareholders. These conditions seem very favourable, but it should be remarked that, although the principal cost of the line is to be furnished by the Portuguese Governrnent, the means will be drawn frora this country, as the payment is to be made by the issue of new Portuguese bonds, which are to be taken by the company at their carrent market value, and which will doubtless from time to time be disposed of in London. The resu1lt will therefore be much the Eame as if a loan had been contracted. The total outlay, it is assumed, must reach about 2,000,0001., and although this, spread over four years, is a comparatively light commitment, the number of similar demands from other quarters likely to come upon uis during that period renders it necessary not to overlook the effect of each additional item. The bar silver brought by the last West India packet has been sold to-day at lId. per oz.-the same rate as that obtained for the last arrivaL At a meeting of the European and American Steam Shipping Company, held to-day, Mr. Crawford, M.P., in the chair, the report (of which an abstract was given on the 14th inst.) was adopted. Arrangements are being made to facilitate the commnencement of the various services, and the line from Hamburg to Brazil, id Southampton, hasjust been opened. With respect to the agreement entered into by Messrs. Croskey, through which they will give the company the benefit of their experience and connexions, favourable resuilts are anticipated, and the early voyages, both to Brazil and the United States, are expected to prove remunerative. The additional capital to be raised in 20,000 shares of 91. each is included in the preferential dividend of 6 per cent. to which the arrangement with Messrs. Croskey applies, and a first call of 31. is to be made within a month, leaving two others of 31. each to be paid hereafter. 1,5;00. a-year has been appropriated for the payment of the directors, and special votes of thanks were passed to Mr. Crawford and Mr. Round for their exertions in organizingthe new company. The resolution for creating the additional capital will have to be confirmed. Advices from Wellington, New Zealand, furnish a report of the opening of the fourth and last session of the Provincial Council, and the address delivered on the occasion by the Superintendent, detailing the progress of the settlement. It is alike satisfactory as regards public works, finances, and immigration. limportant roads have been opened to coniect the town with the most productive distriCts, and, although 50,0001. has been expended in this manner during the past tlhree years out of an aggregate revenue of 80,0001., the Government would commence the present year not only free from debt, but with a balance to its credit. Immigration has steadily continued, and the increase of population fromn this cause was 486 in 1854, 890 in 1855, and 1,002 last year. Within the next three months a further addition of 1,000 or 1,500 was expected, a loan of 50,0001. having been furnished by Mlessrs. John Gladstone and Co., of London, to promote the necessary arrangements. The (Inion Baank of Australia have also offered a loan of W0,000/. at 8 per cent. for ten years on the debentures of the province, which will probably be accepted to comlplete the improvements that have hitherto tended to augment the revenue and to cause it for the last three years to yield a surplus of 1 7,0001. per annum. In the system of opening up! roads the plan is pursued of encouraging the labourers to become smaU landowners, and hence on every truink line at easy intervals townships and agricul- I tural settlements are preriously laid out, so as to afford facilities for the purchase of small allotments. In relation to the subject of Australian railways, ad-ices from Geelong of the 13th of January state that a meetinr had been held of the subscribers to the proposed 8eelong, Ballarat, and North-Western Company, at the otice of the Geelong and Melbourne Company, to consider a proposition for an amalgamation wvith the Geelong and Ballarat Railway projected in London. Some of the shareholders suggested the advisability of surrendering the enterprise into the hands of the Government in preference to amalgam.ating with the London Company, but the majority were in favour of the latter course, and it wasaccordingly resolved to call another meet- mgupon the return~ to the e-olony of their secret-A-yi Mr. lossman. by whom a provisional agreement has already been entered into with the promoters on this side. According to the annual circular of Messrs. Scblusser and Co., of St. Petersburg, dated the 10th: of April, issued by Mr. lenry Willis, the suDply of tallow for this year is estimated at 150,C00 casks, inclusive of the 10,000 casks now on board the wintering ships at Cronstadt. The price was 160 roubles for cash, and 154 with hand money. Of hemp the quantity for shipment will be about 30,000 tons, mostly of very fine quality, while the hemp for shipment in 1858 will be of inferior quality. The supply of linseed is estimnated at 1180,000 quarters, being less than half the quantity exported in 185G. The shipment of wheat lPst year was to the enormous extent of 625,000 quarters, and of oats 225,000 quarters. For 1857 the supply of wsheat is estimated at 200,000 quarters, and of oats upwards of 1,000,000 quarters. The weather was mild, and anl early opening of the navigation was anticipated. Exchange on London, 37i to i. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the examination of the ion. Mr. Stapleton, MP., one of the directors of the Royal British Bank, was concluded. The following relates to the debt or Peru " Bir,-The letter you inserted on the Peruvian debt, ron 'An Old Bondholder,' on the 16th inst., is in many respects inaccurate, ard calculated to mislead. I trust therefore, as a matter of fairness, that you will give plani to the follovwing observations. I'Your correspondent altogether omits to notice the original error committed by the bondholders in accepting the bonds issued on the conversion of the old stock, inclading the loan of 600,0001. in 1853, which specifioally and atsolutely restricted the sinL,ingfund on theFour-and-a-Ealf per Cents. to 2 per cent, per annum. It was to rectify this error, almost amounting to a crime, that the first meeting of the bondholders was held and a committee appointed. Resi: tance to the recognition of the issue of bonds ropresenting a part of the internal debt of Peru in Biitish sterling moniey was only a subsidiary question, although involving a principle of primary imPortance. 'The bondholders could not, indeed, entertain the latter os a substantive proposition, as a condition precedent to obtain an advance on the sinking fund. The official recognition of the bonds representing the internal debt of Peru was exclusively for the judgment of the committee of the Stock-Exchange, over whom the Bondholders' Committee had no control, and in whose hands such a dangerous precedent could be safely left for decision. " The ability and persevering vigilance of the committee originally appointed by the bondholders in representing to the Peruvian Government the undue advantage taken, and the injustice done in the issue of the bonds and in obtain. ing the support of our own Foreign-office, are not to be denied; hut, in the negotiation to which th;ose exertions led, the substantive question w/as the amount of the increase on the sinking fund, and on that ground alone it was con,luded. When any effort was made the utmost concession the Peruvian Minister was authorized to make was an iucrease on the sinking fund of the Four-and-a-Half per Cent. stock from 2 to 5 per cent., and in proportion on the Three per Cents., while a majority of the committee held out for 10 per cent. The question was then referred to a meeting of the bondholders, who almost unanimously resolved to accept the terms offered for the time being, with the understanding that a further increase should take place as the income from the guano augmented. " The majority of the committee, however, adopted a course totally at variance with English practice in business, and subversive of the principle of representation. They said they did not come to take the opinion of the meeting, but to report their ow/n views, to which they should adhere; and as, under such circumstances, they could not carry out the resolution then passed, thle only and inevitable alternative w/as their immediate dismissal. "The event has, T think, abundantly demonstrated that the bondholders then came to a right decision. Had the termis then offered been rejected, it would have afforded the Peruvian Government a pretext to break off the negotiation and adjourn the question indefinitely. " The result would have been that we should have gone on until now with a sinking fund of 2 per cent., instead of 5, which we have had for the two intermediate yea,-s; and if the account you give in The Times to-day be correot, a further increase to 7 per cent. nnconditionaUy Puts an end to all cavils about finality forming any parn of the arrangement. " With respect to the suicidal picture which your correspondent as a bondholder draws of the internal state of Peru and the amount of their obligations, it is not of the slightest importance to the English bondholders, Did their security rest upon no other foundation than the internal resources of Peru and the honesty of her Government I do not believe there is a single holder of the stock who would value it at 10 per cent. But the security of the guano is unquestionable, and from its local situation is beyond the reach of any Government in Peru to controL The quantity is far beyond the highest estimate formerly made. The further experience has extended its utility as a manure is more and more confirmed, so that there is no rational probability of the demand for it diminishing, and it must be borne in mind that the proceeds are received in England and not in Peru. I have lately had the opinion of severai members of Parliament who have been at great pa3us to in. feorn themselves respecting the time the guano may be expected to last with reference to agricultural affairs, and altogether unconnected with bondholders, and the uniform testimony they have received is that it is apparently almost inexhaustible. *- I shall not trouble you with a disou"sion of the demerits of the existing committee of the bondholders. It is certainly a very mylterious affair that, with such a sinking fund, the stock should remain so low, and it has been very broadly insinuated that they have failed in performing their duty in ways pointed out, to which they have offered no explanation or refutation, "Tlhe obvious remedy, hoever, is to dismiss them, and appoint others more worthy of confidence.

THB POST-OFRICE. The Postmastei-Genoraza third annual report for the year 1856, addressed by the Duke of Argyll to I the Lords of the Treasuy, has just been printed. I The following are Bsome- of the most intereating I pa,sages 4 Last year the numbei of post-offices in the umited kingdomn was increased by 368, making the whole present number 10,866. Of these 845 are head post-offices, and 10,021 suboposttoffnces. " A new post-office has been completed at Glasgowv, a newv office provided at Ieith, and increased public acoommnoda tion afforded at the offloes at Drmingham, Devonport, and eliewbhere. " The revision of the posts in the rural districts, including an additional force of letter-carriers, has now been nearly completed; and it appears by wcounts kept since the com. mencement of the revision (1851 tkat at an annual expense of aboat 42,0001. provision lsa been made for a free deli. very of more than 300,000 letters per week (not to speak of new spapers nd books), which formerly could be obtained only Oy application at the ofEice window. " The number of placvs at which free deliveries were established for the first time last year wws 1,05S ; and at 281 other places, including Dablin and its neighbonrhood, the free delivery was extended and otherwise improved. Pillar letter-boxes baving been found very acceptable to the public, their number has been considerably increased; though for a time the supply was suspended while experiments were makindg with a view to improve their construction. These experiments have been succeasral and in a short time a large additional number of pillar iett3r-boxes 'will be put up ih London, Dablin, and Edinburgh, and ii various parts of the country. " The measures described in the last annual reports as in course of adoption for accelerating the delivery of letters in London have, to a considerable extent, been caxried into effect. One of the most important-iz., the firstsortin of the country letters before they reach town-has Provedhiglly successful, about 110,000 each day, or considerably more than one-htlf of the whole number, being now sorted for London districtsin provincial offices. " Inconsequence of the London office being thus relieved of a portion of its work, and enabled to dispose of the remainder with increased facility, the letter-carriers are despatched for the mornig delivery much earlier than for. merly; while, owing to other and additional improvements, a still larger gain is obtained in the time of completing the "In the Appendix, age 3D, iS a table from which it will be seen that, comparing the first six weeks of the present year with the first six weeks of 1856, the morning de:;very on the average is now 33 minutes earler in its commencement, and 45 minutes earlier in its completion. "gEither in te provincial or travelling offices the remain. der of the frst sorting for the mornug delivery will, I expect, soon be made in the same way, to the further relief of the ofice in Lndon. " Postmasters and their assistants have been instructed in this duty by London sorters, and in general all parties have shown zeal and diligence in carrying out this arrangement. "Pablic co-operation in adding district isitials to the letters has been readily accorded, Already about 55,000 letters daily, or ono-third of those posted within the London districts, are so addretsed, as are also a large number of letters from the country, though not in so great a rprtion a' ^ cheap book, giving information as to the principal streets and places included in the several districts, has been published, and a superior edition, with maps, is in *- Owing to the great difficulty of finding suitable places for district offices, te arrangements for expediting tho trans. mission and delivery of district letters have not made equal progress with those affecting General Post letters. In most of the districts, however, baildings, or sites for buildings, have now been obtained. "The advantage of an earlier morning delivery has not been confined to London proper, but has extended to the imumediate suburbs, and in a sil geater degree to several places in the country parts of the district. Thus the General Post letters are now received an hour earlier than formerlT at Beckenham, Bromley, Croydon, Enfield, Hlolloway, 2 Norwood, Peckhan, and Woolwich; and halfan-hour earlier at Brixton, Putney, South-end, Twick-enham, and Walthamstow. " In striking contrast with the present quick transmission of letters, it may be mentioned that as late as the year 1842 a letter posted at any London receiving-house after tWo in the afternoon was not delivered at Ishington tiU the next morning. "C o improvement has yet been made in the streetnomenclature of London; but I hope that the LIetropolitai Board of Works, with whom the matter rests, will soon be able to decide on the measures to be adopted. So long as the present endless repetition of names continues it will be impossible to prevent delays and mistakes in postal delivery. It is thought by some persons that no alteration is necessary, since at present every street, even where there are several of the same name, can be fully designated; as, for example, King-street, Cheapside, and King-street, Coventgarden. But the necessity for such alteration is frequently unknow n, espceially by peersons living at a distance, and, in fact, it is in numerous instances dssregarded, Not ouly should the names of no two streets be identical, but the distinction between them should be broad and clear. Rspeated complaints have been made in the neighbourhood of Westhourneterrace on account of delays in delivery arising from the great similarity in several of the names thereabout, such as Westbourne-park.cottace3, Westbournle-pazk-crescent, Westboorne-park-place, Weatbournepark-road, Wresthourne-park-terrace, and Westheurne-parkvillas. During the last year 52 additional towns were provided with day mails to or from the metropolis of one or other of the three parts of the kingdom, and some of the towns w ith mails in both directions, These mails have also given more frequent postal communications between many provincisl towns. By using the extended portion of the South Wales Railway beyond Haverfordwest the night inail betwoen London and certain parts of South Wales, including Milford Haven and Pembroke Dock, has been accelerated, as has also the north mail to and from the same district of South Wales. An earlier arrival of the London mail has also been effected at Wick, Thurso, and other places in the north of Scotland, although the benefit has hitherto been considerably impaired by irregularities on the railway, owing to the excessive length of the trains in the chief seasons for travelling. Improvement has also been made in the post between England and the south-east of Scotland, Various other malls in different parts of tho united kingdom have been accelerated. "The improvement in thoOrkney service mentioned in the last report has been carried into effect, and additional communication established with some of the Western Islands. " Arrangements have been completed for affording better postal accommodation to the towns on the Clyde. " In addition to those improvements letters can now be posted at several towns up to a later hour thani formerly ; and I hope to extend this improvement to other places where the hour is still inconveniently early. * * A parcel nost service on the Great Northem Ranilway, which ad afforded mruch accommodation to towns on that line, but which was suspended about a year ago in consequence of certain measures taken by the directors (owing to a difference of opinion in other matters having arisen between the Post-office and the company), was last August renewed, the directors having consented to place the arrangement on its former footing. A sinilar arrange. ment (though at present on a smnall scale) for convoying mall bags at parcel rates has been made with the Brighton, South-Eastern, and North-Eastern Companies; and I shonld have pleasre in extending the arrangement to the otber companies in all cases where the amount of correspondence would warrant the expense. When it is considered how numerous, frequently, are the trains between town and town in comparison with those which convey mail-bags, it may appear at first sight that, provided reasonable terms coule&be made with a railway company, postal commanication might often, at a small cost, be largely increased; and this idea leads to applcations which LI am frequently compelled to refuse. It would be of little avail that mail-bags were sent unless provision were niade on the arrival of the bags for the delivery of the letters and such delivery, extending as it frequently would over a large district as compared with the number of letters, would in many cases entail an expense altogether disporportionate to the amcount of correspondence. "In my last report, when speaking of the irregularities in the conveyance ot the important mails between London and the north of England, Ireland, and Scotland, I stated that, other measures having failed to secure greater punctuality, the department had renewed the proposal either that the night mail train should be ran special, or that the number of carriages in the train should be strictly limited - and I expressed a hope that this improvement (for which a fair remuneration would be given) would shortly be brought into operation. In this hope, however, I have been disappointed, two of the principal comnpanies conecrned having hitherto declined to meet the views of the department on this important point. I regret that the existing state of the law does not enable me to insist on a measure which seems to me so essential on certain main lines for securing punctuality. In contrast with the geat irregularities on several of the railways, causing trouble to the departments and annoyance and disappointment to the public, it is satisfactory to refer to the high degree of punctuality attained on the North Bitish Railway, under the operation of the plan of increased remuneration for regularity and ef mutual penalties for irregularity, mentioned in the two previous reports, but which all the companies to whom the plan was prop,osed have, with this single exception, declined. The arrangement, which at the present extends to the night mallq only, came into operation on the lst of July last, and it appears that, whereaa in tho previous half-year there were 112 cases of irregularity (ii 368 trips), there were in the succeeding half-year only nine such cases. At the end of each quarter the company received an additional payment of 2001., being the maximum sum of which the arrangement admitted. It is right, however, to state that, as on this line of railway the mail trains ran at the comparatively low speed of 25 miles an hour (including stoppages), regularity is easier than on many other lines. By an extended use of the travelling post-offioes much sorting of letters, which used to be done on the arrival of the mails, is nOW accomplished previously-an arrangement -which has led to a simplification of business at many of the smaller offices. "Exclusive of conveyance by steanrvessels and boats, and not counting the walks of letter-carriers or rural messengers, or the carriage of the mails from post-offices to railway stations, the whole distance over which mails are now conveyed within the united kingdom is upwards of 61,000 miles per day, being about 2,600 miles more than at the end of 18M. This increase is principal' in railway conveyance; but it will be seen that more thanhalf the duty is stiL performed by coachos and mail carts. "Withregardtothe mails conveyed by railway,theaverage number of miles travelled over by them each week-day has been 22,28.5 miles in England, 2,766 miles in Ireland, and 3,6*1 miles in Scotland-total, 28,692 in the united kingdon, at an average cost per mile of 9id.

I TO THE EDITO OF THB TIMES-. Sir,-One of my communicants sailed about eight or niae woeels since as matron of the omigrant ship Boanerges. The ship on nearing the Bay of Biscay was caught in a severe storm, which partly dismasted her, and drove her back almost a wreck to Qaeenstown, Cork. The emigrants were dispersed, but subsequently reassembled, and agair sailed about three weeks since or less. The ship has been again dismasted, driven back to England, and ran ashore in bringing her in. The poor emigrants, abave 500 innuumber, are in the Government Deopt at Plymouth. Their sad and pitiable situation is simply but touchingly told in a letter to me from the matron, which I venture to endose. If you thought well of insertng it their forlorn case would probably obtain some little help, not to supply them with neoes-saries, but to give the sick among them a few of those almost indispensable comforts which the;means, now exhausted bytheir sorapidly repeated calamity, are utterly unequal to procure. I would thankfQlly take charge of and remit any money sent for this purpose. Believo me Your faithful servant. I _ _ W. WELDON OCTA2IPE,YS. Os. rauns v estry, Apr1 v=. " Government DepOt, Plymouth, April 17. 'flev. and dear Sir,-" Cast down, but not destroyed," I have made several attempts to inform you of our distressing circumstanoes, which, no doubt, yoahave seenbefore this in the newspapers. We sailed from Cork with a fair wind on the 30th of March; we had been but three days at sea when wew ero again dismasted, and put into Plymouth; in cornin into tho dock tho pilot ran her ashore, which, I believe, has disabled her for sea. The oondition of the poor emigrants is distressing almost beyond description, man! of whom are parents with large young families- their scanty stock of clothing isdiminished, having been 10 weeks knocking about without a home; theirlittle moneyisespended, and some have not even a postage-stamp to wrte to their friends; the little extra comforts with which their friends had provided them are exhausted; very many of thoem are ill and broken spirited, and some are rebelious; the hardships to which we have been exposed have made some almost mad, and they have reminded me of theohildren of Israel in the wilderness, when Roses said ' Theo be almost readyto stoneme.' I have been informedthat weave no claim uponthe commissioners, and that we are now maintained at the expnse of the owners of the Boanorges, Baies and Co., of Liverpool. Do you think an appea to public sympathy vould be responded to on behalf of these poor sufferers 9 feel Icannot do instice to their trialsand privat:ons. Many have returnedto their friends or theirhomes ; others would do the same,butbaveneitherto go to. Itisheartrending to witness the dejection of the hardy sons of toil, whose orly ocenption is to watch their sick wives and nur. e their drooping cndren,without the means of helping them. When a poor mother is unable to attend to her young family you know what soon follows-rags, disease, filth. My own little stock of hard earned money has been taxed almost to its limit. Can you suggest or dovlse means by which these poor sufferers could be helped? It is a cause worthy the notico of a British public. We lost one seaman overboard, and two others had broken legs; one we left at Cork with both legsbroken, the other (our steward), an interesting youth, vwth a compound fractuLre, and is likely to lose his leg, is in South Devon Hospital. W With regard to myself, ' as my days so my streng-h has been;' the ' why and the wherefore' of aU this mysterious Providence remain to be revealed. 'AlU is welV,' and I can say ' Only thou soy leader be, gladly I will follow thee.' We anchored in Plymouth Sound on the 7th of this month.

MESOBATION OF LLAXDAFF CATHEDRAL.-.We have already noticed the re-opening, for public -7orship, of a portion of this building, -when a large collection was made, after an eloquent sermon by the Lord Bisho of Oxford, for the further progress of the work which bas been already undertaken. Towards the conclusion of the luncheon, at which the Bishop and the Demi and Chakpter entertained their friendls after the services of the letb, the Archdeacon of Llandaff, obseri-n the general interest which had been excited, submitem a practical suggestion for carrying out what was evidently the common wish of all who were presentt on this Occasionthe entire restoration of that part of tho fabri wbhich is still a ruin. His propoSal was this, that 100 prsons, incluiding himself, shol share the burden, and by contributing each 1001. in the course of the next be yeanri secure at oncee the 10,000. -which is required for the comnpletion of the work.

LO'YDON, THUBSDAY, APRIL 23, 1857. Strange to say-for it really is a fact, and a remarkable fact-that most eminently credulous personage, the British capitalist, does not come forward to sow his sovereigns broadcast over the boundless dominions of Russia. He does not calculate how many of those precious articles it will take to form a continuous line from St. Petersburg to Kaffa, or to spread in the form of goldleaf over -the steppes of Crim Tartary. He distrusts an empire the domestic policy of which is seclusion, and its foreign policy aggression,-which plans its internal communications for external -operations, and makes mercantile value secondary to strategic importance. His suspicions are not allayed when he hears that the very materials of the proposed lines are to be smuggled in duty-free, like an Ambassador's luggage. He recoils from a region where it is all State, and no :public; where trade is tariffed up to the throat, and opinion is always on the march to Siberia. Foolish bird as he is, he fears to venture his bill down the throat which invites hiu ; for though, no doubt, there is a bone to be extracted, there are teeth also to be repassed. In fact, our old gentlemen and our old ladies, and the 3mot!ey group that always turns up in a list of shareholders to Bubble Banks and Diddlesex Railways, are just now in no humour for the bait, notwithstanding the clerical decoy-duck described in our City Intelligence, who is always ordering 20,0001. worth of Russian scrip fror Brussels or Amsterdam. The sphere of enterprise is so distant and so vast; the lines are so long snd so straggling; the conditions so utterly precarious; the contingencies so beyond all English calculation ; the domnestic influence so absolute, the rivalry of all ki,3ds so posaible, and, if profitable, so certain, that, strange to say, nobody is trying to steal a iparch on the Stock-Exchango and get his cent. er cent. by an empirical exercise of his private judgment. Englishmen, indeed, dearly love to win money against tremendous odds. They like mercantile quackery, an.d swallowY ki-or-cure speculations with wonderful gusto. It is a proud moment indeed, in the most sanctified of lives, when a maa can let out to his confidential friend, and through him to the whole town, that he has got 20,0001. by an investment which he alone had the sagacity or the courage to try. What has a man to do after that but to die in the odour of affluence? Yet, with this short cut to wealth now open to us, notwithstanding its risky and paradoxical character, nobody comes forward, at least not openly. Ten years hence we may possibly hear that the worthy Prebendary SAVEALL, whose will has just been proved, doubled his fortune by Russian Railways; but at present the Establishment, the Faculties, the Half-pay List, and Dowagers keep aloof; and the Emperor of RUSSIA 'will have to rebait his hook, to alter his terms, to give up his enterprise, or to make his subjects construct their own railways. Not, then, for the sake of further warning, for none appears to be necessary, but rather to justify ourselves for the part we have taken, we will tell a short story of a much more promising scheme, in a much more improving region, and one much more within the reach of British knowledge and surveillance. Ten years ago there was the flourishing State of Indiana, which everybody could know as much about as he pleased. It is needless, however, to extol its position, its resources, its everything; for, as the sequel shows, they were all considerably too good, and are the very cause of the whole mischief we have to tell. Ten years ago, then, this very promising young State had made immense improvements, and still found great room for improvement; and, what with past, present, and future improvements, both owed and wanted a great deal more money than its Government could just then lay its hands upon. In fact, it had got into that stage of difficulty which we have been lately told in the Bankruptcy Court is certain to occur in the second or third year of the soundest undertaldngs. It owed some millions sterling, and, having paid no interest on its debt for six years, it was on the eve of repudiation, just as its natural resources were showing themselves in brighter colours than ever. So, after some negotiation, a compromise was made between the State and its creditors, a good many of whom were at New York, but many more, we fear, in this country, which strikes us as about the most splendid conception that ever entered into the head of financial defaulter. We are not surprised to find a committee of the unfortunate dupes saying of the successful performers that "they smote the rook of financial resource, and "the living waters gushed forth; they touched "the rock of public credit, and it sprang upon its feet." Indeed, after a careful examination of the whole scheme, we take the liberty of suggesting to the Emperor of RUSSIA to send at once to Indianopolis, and secure, oa any terms whatever, the services of the gentleman who made this arrangement; for we are quite certain if anybody can cover all Russia with a reticulation of railways at the expense of the British, French, Dutch, and everything except Russian public, it is the parties in question. Our own immediate purpose, however, in referring to it isjwt to show our own countrymen how utterly unable they must be to estimate the prospects of any new and distant enterprise, and how entirely they must be at the mercy of Governments, social influences, commercial changes, and accidents of all kinds beyond their controL The following, then, was the compromise made by the State of Indiana with its wearied, but still hopeful, creditors of all nations :-Among various improvements in progress or intended the most advanced and the most promising was a canal. Do not start, British reader, at the idea of an unfinished canal in the year 1846, or suppose that there must also have been a gross of green spectacles offered with it to prepare the eyes of the creditors for an inspectiou of the bargain. The canal was absolutely necessary to the development of Indiana. It was fed by the river Wabash, and ran right through the State, of course avoiding as much as possible other States, and joined the Ohio and Lake Erie. The financiers, brokers, and engineers marked out aa extensive basin that the canal must accommodate, and whose traffic it must for the present monopolize. In fact, it was the highway of the State, and what put that beyond proof was, that some score of intended railwayswere all directed to points on the Wabash and Erie Canal, and thus promised to fulfil the pleasing relation of branches to trunk, feeders to main channel, children to parent, or whatever else one may please to imagine them. It was true that the State of Ohio had a rival canal, and that the State of Illinois had a rival and all but parallel railway forthcon, but what were they to Indiana ? Unfortunately, the State had not even money enough to finish the canal, 50 by way of killing two birds with one stone the State got its creditors to finish the canal at a cost of $800,000, and then take the profits in payment of half the debt. They caught at the proposal so eagerly that, half doubting their luck, they got a second Act to clinch the bargain, and prevent the State from meddling 'with the canal till they had paid themselves out of its profits, which all the most competent authorities in the State said must be enormous. Have our prescient readers followed the dodge? Not a soul of them, we will venture to say. How I in the world are they to enter into the mystery of an American or a Russian financial scheme til they have actually put their finger or their foot into it ? Why, the Wabash and Erie Canal was, of course, prodigiously prosperous by contributing to the construction of the railways that were to ruin it. It was the scaffold of the building,-the contractors' tramway and plant, to be cleared off and sold for waste iron as soon as the real work was finished. As fast as the canal was pushed on the railways on both sides were pushed on too, and the canal supplied them arnd thle population flowing into the State with rails and materials of all kinds. But as each railway was finished it commenced a most undutiful competition, and beat the old canal, or rather the old boat, off the line. The creditors opened their eyes like puppies the second or third year after the bargain, and at their entreaty the State abstained from actuallyentering the field against them. But railways, of course, it must have, as the neighbourinlg States were making them fast; so it passed an Act allowing the construction of railways by private enterprise, and the work went on apace. For a time, then, the canal had a suicidal prosperity, 'which, of course, camie to an end when the railways in this and the neighbouring States were all made. It now can only just keep itself going, if it can do so much. The rents and tolls are swaUolled up in the expenses; they have been reduced to 20 per cent., or less, of what they were, but, as all the profitable traffic is carried off to the railways, and the greater part I of the heavy traffic too, the canal is a bankrupt concern. It has answ-red a temporary purpose, and is now good for notbing. The shareholders are coming again to the Legislature of Indianano longer, of course, as indignant creditorsthey have lost that position-but as outwitted and ruined mortgagees, and ask for a dole from the State Treasury. Our readers know, of course, how likely they are to get it. But, can anybody say they are a bit more at the mercy of the Legislature of Indiana, or that they have proved themselves a bit more simple and credulous than any ordinary Englishman throwing his money into RusSian railways ? We can only aay that even now we would rather invest in Indiana than in Russian railway shares, for there is always some hope in the justice of a free and Prosperous people, but none whatever in either the power or the desire to pay of a corrupt bureaucracy.
Our national postal system works with such efficiency and regularity that we are apt almost to forget its existence as a public department. It is the highest credit of the machinery which distributes so many millions of letters yearly that it forms the subject of so few motions in Parliament and so few remonstrances from the people. If not to be blamed in a free country is equivalent to praise, the Post-office may be satisfied with its reputation. All that we have to do is from time to time to call attention to what has been done, or what the authorities promise to do. The PosTmAs5Tj-GEsxRAL's Third Annual Report, being that for 1856, has just been published, and, though it exhi bits no new faets, but merely records a steady extension and progress in proportion to the advance of the country in population and wealth, yet it deals with such great interests that a summary cannot be uninteresting. Exclusive of conveyance by steamvessels or boats, and not counting the walks of letter-carriers or the carriage from post-offices to or from railway stations, the distance over which mails are now conveyed within the United Kingdom is upwards of 61,000 miles per day, being about 2,600 miles more than at the end of 1855. The direction of such a vast scheme of communication, involving relations with all the railway companies and great numbers of the coach proprietors of the kdngdom, is of itself a work of surpassing raagnitude. Although the increase on 1855 has been principally in railway conveyance, yet some of our readers may be surprised to learn that more than half the duty of distributing letters is still performed by coaches, omnibuses, and mail-carts. Of the 61,000 miles over which mails are conveyed, 28,692 are railway, and 32,721 road. In England alone does the railway surpass the road mileage, the former being 22,285, the latter 19,298. In Ireland the proportion is as small as 2,766 to 8,538, while in Scotland itis 3,641 to 4,885. We now come to the number of letters, and here we are able to appreciate the benefits conferred by cheap postage, and the impulse which it has given to the intercourse, and consequently to the prosperity and knowledge, of the people. The number of letters delivered in the United Kingdom in 1856 was 478,000,000, being an increase of 22,000,000, or 41 per cent., on 1855. If we remember that only 76,000,000 were delivered in 1839, and that, consequently, the number has increased more than sixfold since the introduction of the Penny Postage, we have a measure of the advantages received from a system which seems likely to be adopted by every ciilized nation. The returns given of the proportion of letters to population in each of the three kingdoms involve xome interesting facts. In England the number of letters delivered was 388,000,000, being about 20 to each person; while in Scotland the number was 48,000,000, or 16 to each person; and in Ireland only 42,000,000, or seven to each person. Thus, in activity of internal intercourse England surpasses Scotland, while Ireland lags far behind. Furthermore, the increase per eent. of 1856 over 1855 is greater for England, being 51, while for Scotland it is 41, and in Ireland only 1-25th. In London we are told the proportion is as high as 40 letters for each person. Of the whole number of letters nearly a quarter are delivered in London and the suburban district. So great is the internal communication of the country that colonial and foreign letters form not more than one-fiftieth of the whole number delivered. The Money Order system seems to have taken firm root, and to be flourishing with great advantage to the public. Last year 160 new Money Order-offices were opened. Of these 57 are in the London district, but the great majority were established for the convenience of the rural population. The whole number of offices is now 2,095. The amount sent by such orders was in the year 1856, for England and Wales, 10,099,3661. ; for Ireland, 806,9421.; for Scotland, 899,2531.; total, 11,805,5611. The fact of this enormous amount being sent in sums generally less than 40s., the total number of Orders being more than 6,000,000, is a proof how univeraally the trading and labouring classes profit by the system. The inhabitants of England aud Wales are foremost in the use of the Money Orderoffice, the proportion being one Order to every 4 of the population, while in Scotland it is one to 6, and in Ireland one to 13. Ireland, however, is getting on, since the increase per cent. on the year is 7, while England's is only 7i, and Scotland's is as low as 54. The Money Order-offices now bring in a fair sum to the departmental exchequer. For the years 1847-8 there was a loss, and 1849 only showed a profit of 3221.; but the case is widely different now. The profit for the year 1856 was no less than 22,6741., being an increase of 2,4221. on the preceding twelvemonth. As every one takes an interest in the doings of the Army, we may state that the extension of the system to Constantinople, Scutari, and Balaklava was, in the opinion of the POSTrASTER-GENXRAX, attended with signal success, " more than " 71,0001. having been sent home by the soldiers "and seamen, besides 35,0001. by the Army Works Corps." The remittances from Aldershott during the past year amounted to more than 22,0001., the average amount of each being only 11. Is. 4d. Before we quit the subject of the Inland Post, we may state that the plan o; dividing the metropolis into districts is considered to have been successful. The first sorting of the country letters before they reach town is carried out; " about 110,000 each day, or considerably " more than one-half the whole number, being "now sorted for the London districts in provincial "offices." People have readily fallen in with the plan of adding the district initials to their letters. Already about 55,000 letters daily, or one-third of those posted within the London district, are so addressed. The PosTMrsAsTE-GmNxRsL adverts to the subject of street nomenclature, and urges a change which shall prevent the names of any two streets being identical, and also forbid the application of the same name to various streets, rows, terraces, gardens, and villas in the same neighbourhood. As the Penny Postage has been succzessful at home, there are great hopes that the sixpenny rate for communication with the Colonies will have its triiumph. Last year it was extended to letters between this country and the East Indies, Western Australia, and the Mauritius, and it has just been carried out for Ascension and the Cape. Only some minor Colonies are now excluded from the reduction. The Colonies themselves are esfablishing internal posts at reduced and uniform ratessome Id., some 2d., 24d., and 4d. In India a letter is carried from one end of the country to the other for id., but then it must not weigh more than one-tenth of an ounce,-certainly a very small allowance. The postal convention with France has greatly reduced the rates to the principal countries in Europe. France was in former days notorious for her high rates, which have been only reduced in deference to the unanswerable arguments of the reformers and the exertions of the British Govetnment. Negotiation, are in progress with the United States for a new postal convention, and particularly for the reduction of the charge from 1s. to 6d. The gross revenue of the department for 1856 was 2,867,9541., being an increase on the year of 150,0001., or rather more than 5i per cent. The expenditure was 1,673,5661., leaving a net profit of nearly 1,200,0001. Nearly the whole of this surplus is, however, devoted to the subvention of the great lines of packet5s which unite this country -with North America, the West Indies, Brazil, India, China, and Australia. Eowever, it h3s been longconceded that the Post-offi6e isnot tobe looked to as a source of revenue. That it should, while conferring such ineomparable benefits on the community, be able to support its own organization, is as much as the nation can fairly require.
We must not quarrel with the few miles of salt water which separate this island from the continent of Europe, nor with the thousands of miles of the same liquid barrier which are interposed between the British soil and Australia or either America. Our present social and political position is probably the consequence of a fortunate incident in physical geography. Still this advantage has its drawback-this great fortune is not without its defect. Our very immunity from the evils which have afflicted other nations has produced a population greater than can always find employment, and this surplus has not the same means of flight which they would have enjoyed had we been more intimately connected with the boundless wastes of vaster lands. Could we who are living in the year 1857 awake from our last long sleep two centuries hence, and obtain a glance at the disposition of mankind which will then obtain,we might well wonder at the manner in which we have submitted to the pressure of a population occasionalIy in excess of the demand for their labour, while regions lay open to our enterprise which, as wil then have been shown by practical proof, are calculated to support well nigh innumerable swarms of hiunan beings. What is the secret of the enormous increase of the 'United States within the last quarter of a century? It is simply that there is at the disposal of the overflowing population of the older and more crowded States an enormous expanse of territory, over which the swarms which may choose to take wing from the central hives may spread at their pleasure. Who can suppose for a moment, if the yeomen and artisans of our own islands had the same iacilities as their Transatlantic cousius for moving Westward, that we should hear much more of difficulties or destitution ? In our large towns, of course, as in the large towns of the INorth American Confederation, there wiU always be a certain amount of misery and squalor; for who is to eliminate entirely drunkenness, and profligacy, and crime from the conduct of human affairs ? These, however, and their deplorable results would scarcely affect in an appreciable degree the great flood tide which would spread itself in every direction towards the setting sun were it not for the ten days of salt water which arrest the progress of the overflow. We are well aware that some shortsighted gentlemen murmur about the advantages of cheap labour, and the perils which might arise from a too extensive emigration; but any inconvenience arising from deficiency of population is not among the evils of which these kmngdoms need stand in dread. Were the exits open, thousands upon thousands would rush out at first, but soon the set of emigration would flow in a calm and equable stream, while their absence would but engender new supplies. We are no behevers in panaceas of any kind for the total suppression of aU the evils which afflicts humanity but at least it wrould seem to be proved by experience that the main stress of the pressure which weighs an overcrowded population down to the dust maybe alleviated by opening up to aU those who have the energy and the will for action the means of escape. Now, we wish to caU particular attention to-day to the case of a certain smaU section of the community who would appear to have particular claims upon our sympathy and assistance in this respect. When the Russian war was drawing to its close artisans and artificers were engaged in our various Arsenals and Dockyards to speed the works upon which, as it then seemed, the ultimate sICc ass of the struggle must mainly depend. The Peace came suddenly, as we all know, and in a moment the services of these men, who had been drawn away from their usual occupations, were no longer needed. Their case was a hard one, for even during the short time that they had been called away from their usual employment their places had been fiUed up, and they could not again be taken in at their old workshops. Under these circumstances they resolved to make an application to the Government-for they had been in Government employment-to assist them in a resolution they had formed to emigrate to Canada. To the Canadian Provinces they would have been a most valuable acquisition, for they were men possessed of the very kind of skill of which the Canadas are most in need. The application was made, and not rejected. Bad the Department which employed them from the first resolved to refuse the applicaticn we might have challenged the wisdom of the determination, we might have endeavoured to advocate the cause of these poor men, and to bring it under publie notice, but at least we could not have said that there had been any vacillation or unnecessary disappointment. Let it be understood that we are speaking of the case of some 2,000 artificers who were suddenly discharged not long since from the Woolwich Dockyard, not through any fault of their own, but because the Russian war had suddenly come to an end. They applied, we say, for assistance to emigrate to Canada, and the answer was not a flat refusal-which would have been, as one may say, barsh mercy-but an intimation that if theywould help themselves in some measure the Government was not indisposed to contribute towards the laudable object which they had in view. Upon this intimnation these poor men acted. They gathered together whatever little savings of their own they could muster. Their late fellow-workmen in the Dockyards contributed a day's pay. By hook and by crook, and in one fashion or another, they contrived-as desperate men will contrive-to produce a eonsiderable sum, and then presented themselves again before the Department. Some little time intervened, and at length their hopes were dashed to the ground by an intimation that " the subject had received the serious attention," &c., " but it was with the deepest regret," &c., " that the Department had come to the conclu" sion," &c., " that there was no precedent," &c., "for the course suggested for the adoption of "HER MAJSTY'S Government." Now, we say this is a hard case. The position of these unfortunate persons is a very peculiar one-their request modest and praiseworthy; the effect of it, if granted, would be a benefit to the Canadas as well as to the petitioners. They do not ask for any grant of the public money, but simply for conveyance over ten days of salt water. Their prayer could be granted, we believe, with scarcely any addition to the public burdens, for surely there are at any moment plenty of Qu='s ships in commission, working idly, which might just as well be employed upon this service as upon any other. All that is asked Is that these poor men, who had been attracted from their usual employments into the public service, and who had been as suddenly dismiaed without any fault of their own, might be transported to a portion of the British dominiona in which they might certainly find occupation, and, more certainly than at home, its appropriate reward Wo sincerely trust that the matter may be brought under the notice of the higher functionaries of State, and that they may be disposed upon consideration to grant that moderate degree of assistance to these poor men which they require, and to which they, would certainly seem to be entitled.

COAL MfINES LIGHTED BY GAS. TO TEE 3DITOl OFTHE TB EES. Sir.-The continued fearful accidents in our coal mines, owing in a great measure to a practical defect in the means of their illumination, have given rise to many contrivances for their prevention. Among other means that of lighting by gas has suggested itself to me. In the spring of 18I4, at which period the Barnsley catastrophe took place, I published in theo lining Jourmzal some details of my plan; recent experiments have convinced me that coal gas is the meet economical and safest illuminator that can be used in nines. Itis somewhat strange that these dark regions should be the last to receihe the benefit of that artificial light of which they aretbesource. Dark! Few know howdark. Setup a very small wick in some very bad oil, surround it when "dimly barning" with a gauze, such as our window blinds, which curious eyes can scarcely see through in broad daylight ; you will then have a tolerable idea of the very faint light that the miner is obliged to use. Most of his labour is " piece work," and the better he cn see the more he can earn. The gallery in which he works does not reflect any of the little light that falls upon its walls. The lamp, after hours' burning is nearly doused with its own soot, but being poked at wtLh a bit of wire lightens up, but to quickly sink into a " glim." Can it be wondered, therefore, that the miner prefers a naked light 7 Oil and tallow are a heavy item of expense in the working of a mine, and short-sighted overlookers think there is economy in decreasing the means of light to the men; the miners, on the contrary, are ever desirous of more light, and hence there is an opposition between employer and employed, wbhich will ever lead to eviL If, now, minee were lighted by gas all these evils would be prevented, because there need then be no want of light eacn jet once ignited would never want trimming and could be permanently protected by gauze, in the same way as an ordmnary Davy, with the advantage of being made a fixture such as the miner could not remove without discovery. The loss of life in our mines is a national di.grace, but ^e Times, " ever ready in the hour of the nation's need," will indirectly save us from this dishlnnr_ Yours faithfully, M3eTIMUS PIESSE.

FATAL BoILER ExPLosIoN;.-A boiler explosion, which caused the death of four persons and did serious injury to 10 or 12 more, took place yesterday afternoon in Walsalstreet, Wolverhampton. The boiler wai upon the premises of a fire-iron-maker named Mason, and when it exploded several of the adjoiniug buildings were blown down. he number of persons who were at work at the machinery is not exactly ascertained, but it is supposed there were from 14 to 16, many of whom were much injured. Two of the workmen were killed, and also two children who were playing in the street, a malthouse adjoiuing Mr. Masons premises having fallen upon the latter.

On Saturday nighr last a keeper, in the course of his rounds, was attracted by the hbrking of his dogs to aplace in Stockton's-wood, near Speke-hall, where, lying on the grass, he found a mian in an extreme state of exhaustion. Ohad him removed to the village of Speke, and Mr. Gill a surgeon, was called to him. HIis feet were much swollen, and tte boots had to be cutoff On the removal of his stockings his feet were found to be gangrenous up to the ankle, and the surgeon (Mr. Gill) recommended his removal to the Royal Infirmary, vhere he was taken, when somewhat revived, on Monday. He was received by the house surgeon, -Mr. Morris, who found upon him a number of documents and letters which proved that he was a native of one of the Bernuda Lslands, that he is respectably connected, was a captain, and had brought a ship to Liverpool; that his cer. tificate had been detained by some parties, and that he had in consequence heen reduced to the greatest distress and anxiety, which had affected his mind. His name is withheld for obvious re3sons. He told the persons who foulnd him-and he made a similar statement to Mr. Morris-tbat about 18 dabs ago, being unable to pay the rent for his lodgings, he left the town and wandered he knew not where; that he found his way into the wood, and lain down in a state of exhaustion, and that he had been there a fortnight and two days, occasionaUy eating a little grss and drinking water at a brook which ran through the wood, and to which he had managed to crawl. He says he could hear the bell at Speke-hall ring when any one went to the door but he had not strength enough to call out. A da; or two before be was found, thinking that death was at hand, he scrawled a few linea iun penci on a bit of paper, and addressed them to his friends at Bermuda, adding a line at the bottou, requesting those who found the body to rewrite the letter in ink, and forwaad it to its destintioon. It ws at first feared that the ponr fellow would lose both his legs; bue thak to the excellent treatment at the infirniary and a powetfnl constitution, be is now muuch better, and hopes are entertained of his ultmate recovery.

A STORY OF THS PALACE. (From the AfanchaesterXamimnr. Every reader of Dickens's veracious na-raAtive of the "Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit" wil doubtless remember that impresive episode in which " Seth Pecksuiff"Esq., arrives in a c%b before the second floor residence of "Ms. Sarah Gauip," midwife, High Holborn. Perkins or Whiks ? Who could it be ? At all events, it was some poor Ijenedict in distress, puihed off pell-meU at the eleventh hour, with a heart palpitating between conjugal solicitude and parental an ticipationis. So, at least, the matronly gossips who quickly congregated under the windows of the monthly offlciaI aforesaid settled amot,g themselves, while cabby's whip was put into requisition to malke a stir among the 'dower-pots, and wake the slumbering handmaid of Lucina to a sense of her weighty duties. In this pleasing delineation of a frequent dilemma who does not recognize a touch of nature which makes, if not all men, at least the better portioru of them, kin ? We say no more, but pass on to the narration of an incident which comes home to every Briton, whether Ccelebe or Benedict, maid or motheet A few minutes before 2 o'clock on the morniing of Tuesday (yesterday) week agentleman, evidently in distress, was seen ranning in eager haste in the vicinity of the Horse Guards, making for a neighbouring cab etand, Whether it was Whilks himself, or some friendly deputy, is not stated; but of the urgency of his mission who that saw bim could entertain the slightest doubt' " Cabby" is at that hour of the morning a doubtful per. sonage. What if, after waiting for hours without a call, he should have betaken himself to his pillow? The case, like every other case of the kind, depends on speed. If no " Cabby" can be found, who knows but that an inquest must be held in the conrse of the next 24 hours? Fortune, however, for once pities misfortune. One solitary cab is on the stand, surely kept there by some kind angeL A word and a wink are enough. The poor hack looks tared to death, and the wheels of the vehicle seem meditating some centrifugal feat not at aU favourable to locomotion ; but man must be refc of humanity, borsefleeh must renounce aU pretension to creature sympathy, and even matter must be preternaturally inert, if such a look of distrems as that poor gentleman wore did not send all three careering along the Strand like a young steam engine and appurtenances The case was critical and pressing. Two doctors bad to be summoned. The creaky vehicle had to be driven first to Hertford-street and back, then to Sackville-street and back. Thanks to your selectest influences, ye vestal stars I the work was done, and in a few hours it was announced to the world that " mother and child are doing well," Now, who was this matron whomn in the dead hour of night, "Cabby" so opportunely befnended? We renounce a climax, and tell our readers at once. It was that Most Gracious Sovereign who reigns in the affections of 30,0:0,000 of British subjects, and on whose dominions the sun never sets. Far be from us the slightest wish to squeeze anything melodramatic out of the incident wve have faithfuly recorded. TheQueen of Englandisneither more nor less than woman; not a whit fairer or brighter for the diadem she wears than she would be if those domestic virtues wbicb, in her case, adorn the highest rank had been destined to bless the lowest. Still, we do not set so lightly by aur Sovereign as to be able to regard the affair with perfectgood humour. We pay hand. soinely for the maintenance of a retenue of servants to wait upou her on all ocasions. Only a small portion of the munificent sum which is set apart for the Queen's household goes into her private purse. The remainder is for the m ost part divided among a crowd of splendid retainers. There are masters of the horse, grooms in wait. ing, equerries, gold sticks and silver sticks, and good. ness knows what not; everything, in fact, but one or two sensible, serviceable attendant who know how to provide for the commonest emergency. One is reminded of the embarrassed old woman's petition, "Good stick beat dog, dog won't bite pig, pig won't get over the stile," ;c., save that, in this case, the stick or sticks, for there were plenty of them, both gold and silver, did not begin to beat the dog, and that but for a poor, unsalanied "cabby," w.ith his fotur inches of well-used whipeord, the peer woman would not have got home that night, The trite observation, that the wealthiest people are the worst served, is, it seems, untiversally true. It is certain that Mrs. Perkins, blessed only with a faithful husband and a maid of all work, would have been as well, if not better, attended to. After this proof of astidnity we may well wonder that the Prince Consort bad not to run for the doctor himself. The incongruity of the incident with the previous State arrangenients is most ludicrous. Here we have had half a dozen Cabinet Ministers wasting away the precious interval of Parliamentary repose for a month past, not daring to stir till they had been summoned to the ante-chamber of the Eovereign. Her MIajesty's faithful lieges have been in inxious expectancy for the same period, and crowned heads had given their final orders for the earliest telegraphic announcement of the event. All through the previous Monday evening it was evident that the expected moment was at l and, yet, when it came, there had to be a despairing rush at the nearest " stand," and, as fortune would have it, a poor cabby stood between his Sovereign and an exigency which we are too loyal to contemplate. And all thin while sumptuous stables, built regardiess of expense, threw their stately shadows P,lcidly under the moon's gaze, and a host of lubberly grooms were snoring in the Palace chambers !
AM. PATUREAU'S GALLRgY oF PAriiNrsG.-The second and concluding day's sale of M. Patureau's beautiful coUection of pictures took place to-day at the Hdtel des Ventes, in the Rue Drouot. The eagerness to be present was even greater than on the preceding day, and long before the doors were opened a great crowd of amateurs had collected outside, and in a few minutes after 2 o'clock, the hour at which the privileged holders of tickets were admitted, the room was Sfied. Just behind the auotioneer's chair was placed the famous Hobbima, having onone sidethe "Portraitof alRabbi," byRem. brandt, and on the other, the " Portrait of Martin Pepin," by Vandyck-a goodly feUowship. Precisely at 3 o'clock M. FllWet, the auctioneer, comrmenced the proceedings The followhig were the prices given:-" Interior of a Tavern," Ostade-8,OOOf. " Caseade in Norway," Ruysdael, the water sparkling and bubbling in the most wonderful manner-6,800f., considered very cheap, "Marine, Sea calm," Vandevelde -10,GOOf., to x LanenviUe. "The Cuirassier Dismounted," Karl Dujardin-14,OOOf., to M. Pardieu. " The Player on the Cithern," Ostade, an exceedingly small picture, scarcely larger than a sheet of notepaper, but of the greatest possible perfection for colouring, expression, and grouping-in fact, a perfect bijou-18,100L, said to have been purhbaxed for the Count de Morny. " A Young Girl Dressing," Terburg-7,800f. And now came the great event of the day, the sale of the Hobbima, known by the name of " The Ulill." It is a good-sized picture, nearly 4 feet by 3, having towards the left two buildings representiog the mills with the wheels at rest, the whole reflected in the clear water below. To the right is a piece of forest-ground, stretching far away in the distance. T'he sun pierces warmly throngh the glades towards the front, while all the part behindisdark. It is impossibletoconceiveamoro beautiful composition, but the connoissours present seemed to consider it a little hard. It was put up at l00,OGOf., but no response being given, 9W,GOOf., 80,OOOf., down to 60,000f. were successively asked, and this last-named price w!as ac cepted by a stout gentlemnan at the end of the room. The bidding then went on, but with less spirit than was expected, and at 90,000G. the affair seemed to hang fire. After a pause, however, the offers went on again at 500f. each time, until at last the hammer feU to 96, 500f. to M. Schultz, a retired manufacturer. "The Repose in the Country," Cotlues-45,000f. ; said to be for the Marquis of Hertford, "A Animals Grazing," Paul Potter-15,050f. ; considered a very high price for the pioture, which was not of the artist's best bandlmg. "A mythological subject," Rubens, a large picture suited for a museum-11,200f. "M rch of an Army," Wouvermaons, a remarkably spirited, well-executed picture-12,600f., by the Count de Nieuwerkerke, for the Louvre; deemed exceedingly cheap. "- Young Woman Dressing," Mieris, a very small pictnre, but of great beauty and in perfect preservationX 9,700f., to M. Etienne Leroy. " View of Haarlem " RBysdael, rather a landscape than the representation oi a town, the buildings being of the smaUest size in the distance, and the remainder being theopen country-9,700f. " Smokers," David Teniers-2.550f. " Marine," Backhuysen, a large picture representing the sea becoming troubled at the approach of a tempest- 6,0001F. considered cheap, by ,L Etienne Leroy. " Portrait of a Rabbi," by Rembrandt, put up at l;,C90f., but without acceptance. The price was then gradually lowered by 1,000f. at a time to 4,060f., which was responded to. Notwithstanding this seeming coldness the bidding was unusually rapid, and at the eud of three or four minutes the ha'nmer feU to 15,100f. " Portrait of Martin Pepin." Vandyck, from the King of Holland's coUection, a very fine pieture-15,000f. " Halt of Horsemen," ouvenrans, a small but very beautiful picture, put up at 12,500f., rapidly rose to 22,500f., where a pause ensued, The bidding was then resumed with great spirit, the contending parties being M. Roux and the-Count de Nienwerkerke. The former gentleman having offered 50,000f., the Count bid 50,100f., at which price the picture was knocked down to himfortheLouvre. It hadcostonly 20,000f. at Count de Mlorny's sale about four years back, so that tbere has been a sufficient profit on the transaction. "The Guard-house," David Teniers-20,50f. " The Two Co-sins." attributed in the catalogue to Watteau, but vL Laneuville. the e-xpert, announced that as he could not take on himiself to guarantee the authenticity of the work, the purchasers must form their own judgment.

MILITA4R AZD fA VAL 1NTBLLrnE2 WO. General Sir John Bargoyi, G.C.B., Inspector-Genera of Fortifications, visited Portsmouth and Gosport yeSterday, accompanied by Colonel Foeter, C.B., commandingRoyalEngineer3 in the south-west district, and impected the new works, barracks, &e., on both sides of Portsmouth harbour. Vice-Admiral Sir George Seymor., R.C.B., Commanderin-Chief at Portsmouth, struck his flag at sunset on Tuesday and went on leave. The Furious, 16, paddle steam frigate, Captain Osborne, C.B., and the Firm gunboat left Spithead before daylight yesterday morning for China. The Sylph steamer landed about 300 of the 72d High. anders at Portsmouth on Tuesday from Jersey, and left for that island again in the afternoon with two companies of Royai Artillery. She wil return to Portsmouth with the remainder of the 72d. The Avon ateam tender landed at Portsmouth on Tuesday the men belonging to that port paiid off from the Nile, 92,atPlymouth, and left yesterday with others belonging to the eastward. The Agamemnon, 91, was undocoked at Portsmouth yes. terday, and put into the steam basin, where she Is being rapidly expedited for the service of laying down the Atlantie telegraph cable. The Camperdown, 104, old three-decker, was taken out of dock yesterday at Portsmouth to muake room for the threedecker Princess Charlotte, which Is to be fitted for immLe. diate commison on the China station as a hospit sip. Her Majesty's screw steam frigate Doris, lately launched from Pembroke Dockyard, left for Devonport under the charge of IMr. Martyn, of that port, on Tuesday afternoon. The Doris has been jury-rigged, and was towed by the steamships Sphinx and Prospero, the latter vessel returning after assisting as far as St. Anne's lighthouse, situate at the mouth of Milford Haven. The Doris will have her engines placed on board and will be made ready for sea at Devon. port. The large new tidal basin in course of constrution it Chatham Dockyard is progressing rapidly, and, as soon as completed, wil afford accommodation for line-of-battle ship., which have hitherto seldom been sent to that establishment for repairs, owing to the want of suffioient dock acoommodation. The new dock has been built on the site of the old No. 2dock, and will be of the length of 360 feet, and92 broad. The foundation of the basin has been laid on beds of concrete, the bottom and sides being built of granite. Durlng the progress of the works considerable difficulty bas been experienced from the constant breaking in of the water, but this has been Aemedied by the erection of two powerful steam pumps, which discharge four tons of water per minute, day and night. As soon as the worlzs connected with the new tidal basin are completed, it is in contemplation to lengthen the adjoining, No. 3, dock nearly 100 feet, making its length up. wards of 300 feet, so as to admit a larger class of vessels. Messrsi Rgby, the contractors, have also lengthened No. 7 granite slip 60 feet, making its total length 330 feet. As soon as the whole of the works intended to be carried out at Chatham Dockyard are completed that establishment will be the most commodious in this country. The Warspite, 50, has been docked at Cbatham for the purpose of undergoing extensive repairs and to be fitted for sea. The Hood, 90, screw steamer, building at Chatham, Is to be completed forthwith and fitted with engines of 600-horse power. The Racoon, 22, screw steam corvette, intended to be launched at Chatham on Saturday next, will, in addition to her other heavy armament, be supplied with two 68-pounder long pivot guns, each of 95 cwt. and 10 feet in length. As soon as launched she will be fitted with machinery of 400horse power. A hastening order has been received at Sheerness for tho fitment of the paddlewheel steam frigate Terrible, now under repairs in No. 1 dry dock, Sheerness. She is destined to assist the Agamemnon in laying down the telegraph wires between America and Newfoundland. The Terrible is 884 horse-power, she has four cylinders of 74 inches diameter, with 8-feet stroke, and she previously worked up to 2,000 horse-power. It is .in consequence of her being fitted with the most powerful engines in our navy that she has been selected for this undertakdig. A number of additional artisans have been set on to hasten her fitment. Mr. Allan M'nnes, chief engineer, has taken up his comm3ssion and joined the Vesuvius at Sheerness Captain Charles Wise will take up his commission to this ship this day. Mr. Joseph H. W. Bowman, Paymaster Dec. 28, 1853, has taken up his commission and joined the Vesuvius. The new screw steam corvette SFcout, of 21 guns, and 400. horse power, arrived at Sheerness yesterday from Woolwich, to be placed in the second-class steam reserve, under charge of CiptaIn Fdward r. isted, of the Edinburgh. The Porcupine, 3 uns, paddlewheel steam-surveyingvessel, Captain Henry Z. Otter, and har steam-surveying tender the Seagull, in charge of Mr. William Stanton, left Sheerness yesterday morning at daylight for Stornaway, and thence she proceeds to her surveying ground round the Hebrides. The Seagull has been fitted with a pattern en- o onx deck, for the purpose of gathering in the deep sea fead line, the engine occuping a space of only about 2 feet square. It is equal to a 4-horse power engine; it can be worked to make from 500 to 600 revolutions per minute, -and will gather inboard 400 fathoms of the line in eight 3mnutes. By this medel engine soundings can be taken in deep water in a considerably shorter space of time than by the old mode of gathering in the deep sea lead line by a commonl hand-winch. The following appointments were made yesterday at th Admiralty: Lieutenant A. Graves and Lieutenant L Brine, to the Assistance; Lieutenant E. F. Weld, to the Adventure; George A. Stabb, master, to the Adventure; Duncan J. Louthid, master, to the Assistance; Fysher Negu, sargeonanpermtendent, to the Eamilla Mitchell {convict.ship, and John Ashton, assistant-clerk, to the Implacable.
THE LATB EXPLOSION AT LUNDHILL. It will readily be belheved that after nearly 200 bodies have lain in the confined recesses of the pit for upwards of two months an amount of noxious effluvia will be emitted which will render the task of recovering the bodies and restoring the workings of the pit not only extremely disagreeable, but, without great precaution,. also extremely dangerous. It will, therefore, be a matter of some interest to the public to know that the most careful measures are being taken to reduce both the unpleasantness and danger as much as possible. Dr. Holland, of the Board of Health, a few weeks ago visited the pit, and gave vanoas directions with this view, and Messrs. Sadler, Iteson, and Sadller, of Barnsley, surgeons to the Lundhill Company, have now addressed to them a long letter on the same subject. The surgeons state that those who have descended into the pit report the existence of a considerable stench at the bottom of the shaft now that the water is low. This the surgeons attribute in great measure to the lack of ventilation and the effluvia from the carcases of several horses lying near the bottom of the shaft; and, as the ventilation will lave to be restored as the men penetrate the worlkings, they do not apprehend that an equal stench will be found in the pit generally. They recommend that all advances from the bottom of the shaft into the pit should be preceded by the circulation of sulphurous acid, to be generated by mixing oil of vitriol with M''Dougall's powder; that only hale men should bo employed in the recovery of;the bodies; that, provided there is much smell, the nen should come frequent y to the surface, and that any yerson who may feel himself powerfully affected by the stench should at once return or awhile to the fresh air. They intimate that to carry out the latter recommendation it will be necessary to have relays of men, so that the work may progrees as rapidly as possible. Attaching great importance to the removal of the noxious effliviabyventilation, tbey are glad to learn that ample currents can be obtained without mnuch difficulty, and suggeet that the bodies should be cleared as the men advance; the latter can keep toleeward of the current, and thus in a great rreasure avoid the effiuvia. They recommend the use of Sternhouse's charcoal respirators, and that M3'Dougall'sdisinfecting powder should be not only dredged upon the bodies, but freely scattered about the mine; that the corpses should be put in coffins lined with pitch and kept in readiness in the pit; that the corpses should then be removed to the shed erected for their reception, and afterwards interred as speedily as possible, the lds being left unclosed until the time of removal for interment, to prevent such an amount of effluvia accumulating as wil 0ooe out of be coffin during removal. As the shed is well ventilated the surgeons do not apprehend any evil from the coffin lids being partially unclosed, provided no large number of corpses are allowed to remain there at one time. The letter concludes as follows: ' No idle curloAlty by the pubbe ought to be gratified by admittUBg them to the shed, for if any person should become affected with itlless after needlesely exposing himself to the effluvia which may arise irom the deadhodics, imiasintion might an this as the ce. To Ruard :VInst any charge of negligonce we advise your committee not to ow persons meedle.9ly to inrpect the dead bodies either inthe abed orany otherpa,t ot the works. f the four bodis already recovered are specimens of tbe shte In which the remainder will be found, it appears to us desirable that the friends ahould not attempt anv recognition of the dead bodies, for it wfil be dillicult, if not impossible in the majority of cass to Identify them, except by their articles of dress. Any attempt at recognition wiu only add to te distrees of mind to their surviving friends, and wil be a co.res of pairful aseoclations.

The W)IT WORTH and B£ZP9T'LD BIP4,9s. For the Ila few d aP ery interesting and ir A0 sres of exporh*&k has been in rogress at the Goverif, zient Ychool of 3(l*&We HYthe, in order to test the compativeinerits of th ot' rifle The tria hich was of the most searching and impeaia character, was conducted by Colonel Hay, the able head ,Of the school, and has ter. intnted in establishing beyond &O doubt the great and decided superiority of Mr. Whitwo:th's invention The Enfield rifle, which was considered so mnnch better than any other as to justify the formation of a 755e Government establishment for its pecial manufacture, has been completely beaten. I accuracy of fire, in penetraieon, and in range its rival excels it to a degree which hardly leaves room for companison. The following table gives the best results that have been obtained from ]0 shots of each arm respective'y in the oourse of the experiments, which have extended over a week in time, and were brought to a close yesterday in the presence of Lord Panmure and of a number of mility and scientific spectators - It would appear from these figures that at 500 yards in 10 shots the Manchester rifle has a superior accuray of 1-87 of a foot; at S yards 311; at 1,100 yards 5663; and that at 1,400 Yards and cupwards the Enfield weapon ceases to afford any data for a comparison. Iu penetration the re. lts obtained have been equally decisive; the Whitworth projeetile with the regulation charge of powder going through 33 half-inch planks of elm, and being brought up by a solid oak bulk beyond, while the Enfield ball could not get past the 13th plank. The shooting on Tuesday was more to satisfy Lord Paninure and the other strangers present upon the comparative merits of the two weapons than to show the limit of what each could do under favonrable circumstances. Still, the argets of every 10 shots on either side bore decisive evidence of the superiority of the new zifle, as a glance at the following table will prove:- T'he last entry in the table records the mean radial distance from a central point of 10 shots fired from a tablerest by Colonel Hay and Mr. Guner, the manager of the Enfield factory. Both are first-rate niar}smen, yet at 500 yards the Mnchester rifld in the hands of the former gives three times as good shooting as the latter can get out of the Government arm. All the other trials were made by Bring from a beautifuUy-constructed machine rest, which placed both weapons ona footing of perfect equality as to the conditions under which they were tested. In addition to the foregoing experiments,there was one for showing that with cylindro-convoidal balls on the expansion principle of those used for the Enfield rifle very superior shooting could be obtained from Whitworth's hexagonal bore. This was most satisfactorily estblished, the mean deviation on the target from the centre of the group of 10 hits being only '85 of a foot at 500 yards' range. It wiU be observed that at 800 yards' range,atwhich the practice commenced, the shootIng of Whitworth'srifleassowmuoh betterthan the other that no greater distance was attempted. A reference to the first table of experiments will also demonstrate that the target made by the former weapon at 1,100 yards is nearly as good as that made by the latter at 500. These are great results to have achieved, and amply justify the forethought of the late Lord Hardinge in securing the services of so eminent a mechanic as Mr. Whitworth for the improvement of the rifle. Until he took the subject in hand the proper principles for guidauce in the construction of the weapon hadnot been accurately determined. The manufacture was still conducted by rule of thumb, and in a very haphazard way on the most important points. The use of grooves and an expansive projectile made it impossible to aecure the requisite amount of pitch in the rifling and the indispensable hardness of metal in the bUllet for penetration. Moreover, from the small amount of bearing, the wear and tear both in the barrel aud in the projectile were enormous, and the length of the latter could not be increased without causing it to capsize in its flight. By the polygonal bore and rapid pitch to which the form of the buUet accurately conforms Mr. Whitworth has rendered stripping impossible, and, his rifle when fired acting exactly like a male and female screw, the projectile must rotate with perfect steadiness and precision on its axis. He can increase its length so considerably as to secure space for converting it into a shell if necessary, and, being able to use metal of any degree of hardness, he ean adapt its form and strength exactly to the work which it has to perform. Thus, with a rifle 39 inches long and half-inch bore, having a turn in 20 inches, or two turns in its length, he finds no difficulty in penetrating a wrought iron plate 6-0lths of an inch thick or cutting a core out of a piece of solid timber half-a foot thick; and some idea may be formed of the extraordinary power of his arm when we mention that his projectiles in their flight rotate at the rate of 15,000 revolutions per minute. The question of driving holes in the 4-inch breastplates of floating batteries Is at once solved by the application of these principles to artillery, the construction of which this new rifle proves nmust be completely revolutionized. A weapon which in erpert hands will make good practice at 1,400 yards, and the range of which can be very easily helped by a telescope if necessary, gives the coup de grace to our present system of field batteries, At the Alma it would have silenced the Russian guns or driven them from their position, rendering the rush of the Light Division, with the heavy loss of life consequent thereon, un necessary. Nor during the siege of Sebastopol would the rope mantlets of the Redan and the Malakhoff have given much protection to the men working behind the embrasures. It affords some consolation, in the midst of those difficulties with which the question of army reform is stiU surrounded that at Hythe au institution exists, under zealous and efficient control, where the training of the soldier in the knowledge of his weapon will in a short time be well provided for. Supplied with the best rifle that can be made, and stimulated to its dexterous and accurate use by some such judidious system of rewards as that we understand Colonel Hay is anxious to see established, our military force, small as it is, should, in real strength and fighting power, be quite on a par with the largest continental armies. And no less result than this ought to satisfy a nation like this, so full of those resources by which the individual Englishman is made the equivalent of even hundreds of men placed under less favourable circumstances for action. The prindples of rifling developed in the Manchester small arm are even still more applicable to artillery, and their applicability fortunately coincides with theabsolute necessity for great and decisive changes in that branch of the service. It can no longer be doubted that rifled cannon can be made at a reasonable cost, and that out of the ordinary size of fieldpiece, if necessary, can be obtained, with an accuracyof fire hitherto undreamt of, the range, weight of projectile, and penetration of the heaviest ordnance. The means of demonstrating these facts were, at the lato Lord Hardinge's suggestion, put by Mr. Whitworth within reach of the *Woolwich authorities months ago, but they have taken no steps in this most important matter. Here is jest the invebtion which the peculiarities of Chinese campaigning demand, yet no one thinks of turning it to account. In those vast manufacturing establishments which the war was taken advantage of to form at the public expense macbinery has been put up for the production of =iven implements of warfare, and the tremendous vis nevticc of Governmentis now committed to these models. Will the new rifle be adopted in preference to the Er field ? Will it even have a recognized place beside it ? Whatever practical answer time may give to these questions, the British soldier is clearly entitled to the best weapon that can be procured for him, and the recent experiments at Hythe satisfactorily show that the best weapon is not that which the State has been running up such huge workshops to provide bim with.

Is mot your Ind!an eotrm spondent in error when he tells us that in our own .4and, as it were, our own sugar can be grown, and our bidigo obtained; that in t'at country, now but afew days' jourWne from us, governed by Englishmen, ruled by English laws; judged by men of British blood, every staple article which England requires for ker commerce, her progress, ber prosperity, and the welfare of her people can be grown in ample abundance? To read the glowingascountsw hich you have given us of the wonderful ,and seemingly inexhaustible mines of wealth which India is sad to con. tan seems more like reading a tale from the Arabiain i Night,, than of what you say are undeniable facts Is it to be believed that these resources ae lying. waiting only to be touched by the energy of English enterprise, to be stimulated by the yellow coin of the English capitalist, to turn to riches that shall add not only to the greatness of this island and promote the welfare and happiness of its pebple, hut add oomfort to our Indian subjects, elevate the ryot and Hindoo, prevent famine,-and that the development of these rwesources will then be simply a dischge of a duty which we owe to a country we have undertaken to govern, and a people whose happiness we have undertaiken to promote ? -How canit be belioved that this cmn be a you sy, and England stand idle! Can it be pomiblethat, if it be so, the Govermnent of India can reet a day until some of theme r ces are taken advantae of ? Can it be possible that our legilators can busy themselves and waste their time on matters which are as drosescompared to the bringing into the light of day these rich mines of wealth and madng them add to England's glory? You tell us that a tenthprt of the profits which could be derived from certainindus. tral underthings In India would be ample remuneration for Enliah capital, and that there 'i not on the fac of the earth a field for investment comprable with It, and the Indian Government state that on irrigption worls recently executed they are realizing a profit almost fabulots. How can any reasonable man conceive this to be. true? Are not some of our leading capitalists embaridng in Runlan railways, where the most that can be reaized is 4Q per cent., with 6 per cent. of the remaining profits ; and can it be believed that capitalists of the position of Meur. Baring would so embark the gains of their succesful career if there be such fields for investment a you state open to them? It Is but rarely thtt 17i Times s wkng, and I fina your statements spported by no less a nanthan Lord Dalhousie, by the Government returns of the East India Company, by a large amount of private correspondence with India, andby every man of intelligence who has evor visited that country. If all those authorities combine to xupport what you haye so frequently and so eloquently stated, the solution of the apparent apathy of English capitalists in all that con. cerns India must be sought for in other causes than in dis. belief of statements or insufficient evidence of what can be done in the land of the East. Where, then, shall we turn to ascertain the cause of a preference for Russian 4i per to the enormous profits whioh it would appear can with oertainty be realized in India? Is it that we are insufficiently acquainted with the resources of the country, and would rather trust our money in a country dazzled by the splendour of a Moscow ooronation than in a country with which we will not trouble to make ourselves familiar? Poeibly it may be that the people of this country have been so accustomed to look to the Conrt of Directors of the East India Company to take the lead in everything that tends to the welfare of the land committed to their care that they cannot believe it possible that any good can there be done, seeing that this Court takes no interest in the mattor. Or, is it possible that there exiSts among that hon. body a dread of rival associations, and that as nothing can be done in India without their aid and sanction, they stay the hands of those who would gladly lAvish their wealth to enrich our Indian subjects, while they would obtain for themselves snch profits as England knows not of ? If it be so, and in one of your *ble articles you say it is, that the English capitalist looks to the Indian Government for a sanction of every project for theimprovement of India in the shape of a guarantee of a iniin,msn rate of dividend, why is it that the Court of Directors do not come forward and welcome every enterprise brought forward by men of integrity and position and acquainted with the subiect, and guarantee rates of profit which their own pub Ished reports show to be but trifles as compared with the actual result which seem certain to be obtained? But it may be said, what are the undertakings which would prove most beneficial to India and to which English capital should first be attracted ? The only enterprises to this time fostered at all by the Government have been railway undertakings; but these have not been promoted so much to develope the resources of the country as to provide for the rapid transport of large bodies of troops, necessary, no doubt, in a newly-conquered land. Look, however, at the vast territory in India as tranquilly subject to tho dominion of England as any part of our land. Is this to be neglected? What will most benefit these districts2 Thatgreat man Lord DAlhousie,the Marquis of Tweeddale, and yourself, tell us, and all the authorities which I have met wKith corroborate the fact, thatthefirstnecessityofIndiafor the develop. ment of its resources is water; that with this supplied the veriest waste land will blossom as a garden. Oh ! for some -' Habitans in Sicco," as eloquent as your late correspon. dent, to tell of the blessings that would flow from a supply of this great want. How would he tell of noble tivers flowingidly to the sea through lands lying waste for want of refreshing streams ! How would he tell of the simple and inexpensive modes by which these bright floods might be made to fertilize the soil, to make the lands which languish for want of moisture teem with all the varied products of an Eastern clime ! And then, to show what can be done, he would point to such works as the Godavery Canal, where for an outlayof 300,0001. no less than 1,200,000 acresoflandbave been irrigated, and 1,000 miles of canal navigation afforded, and, as if to rouse the lethargy of English capitalists, and to draw them from expending their money on Muscovite lands he would tel them that in the first year these works reali7ed a net profit of 3S3 per cent., and that the profit rests not there, but graduaUy increases. Next to the want of water India requires cheap means of communication, particularly with the ports, that the rich products of the soil may not be rendered too costly in Eng. land by the high price of carriage. Is it not strange, if all we are told be true, that in providing the supply of water the cheap mode of transit by canal can at the eame time be afforded ? It may seem strange to English ears that the two can be combined, but it has been effected with great success in India. These are the principal wants of India. Let English capital be embarked in supplying those, and Such results will be obtained as the world has never witnessed. But it will be said, how can tho capital be spared with the I ressure which now exists ? The answer is, that if there exists sufficient capital to be tempted with such terms as Russia has conceded for her railways, the Indian Government bas it in its power, and it is iLts imperative duty, to draw that capital from Russian enterprise to Indian improvements, by offering terms much more advaut3geous to the subscribers, and of far more importance to the welfare of this country than any development of Itussia can ever prove. I conclude %ith the words of your able review on Colonel Cotton's work on Public Works in India, " We went to Iadia two centuries ago as traders; a century since we became conquerors and taxgathercrs ; it is time we should prove ourselves improvers and benefactors."

Tnat w should ever have stood in a position of infemity in thr matter reflectaanything but credit on our dip3b6acy. But it seems now that Russia, rather thbn have tile we of English oficials upon her, is willing to withdraw her own, and to cut off all claim for the establishment c our oon. Plate altogether. Well, this, at all events, is one very substantial gin. EDglishmen make about the Wozstofspieg. They aro too honest themnselves to have a correct *pprecia_ Yion of villany, which is in turn viewed in the most exaggerated lights, or is permitted to pa altogether unngoed. Sir Hartford Jones Bridges infornms w that the expenne of the Emba at Teheran, including pubsidy, smounted, between 809 and 1827, to About 128,00W., And betwee thes later date and 1837 to 30,0001. a-year, or in all 't ibot 2,500,OOML sterling. I am not aware of the charges fc the past 20 yers, but should sUpPOse them to be about 500,0W more, or about 3,000,00W1. in all, in 46 years. Tke anl; single end gained by this is to have creted a perpetha demand formore, with the conviction that we fear the Persin and are willing to expend any amount in purahasng peaez rather than incur the risk of going to war. It is nOw propoeed to subsidize Dost Mahommed at the rate of 10,00.L per month, and a more mon stroes piece of waste or inauity can hardly be oonceived. it win at one eate he impreesion that we are afraid, that we feel Unable to defetul ouselves, and must purchase the aid of the Affghaa todefendus. Thatone shillingof thissubridywillaeverb expendedinourservice no human beingca be ilne enough to conceive. We shll, of course, have the amo stor over again. Shall we tire of pying the Dost *bsidyfor doing nothing, and complain to him that he ha not fulfilled the conditions of his bargain ? The reply, of eourse, would be that we expected too much, that he has done al1 that he could, And that his allowances have been too lile; we have only to double the ra, and our wishes will be fulfilled. We must then go on increasing our contrUtioas, in full assurance that they will be as much misued as before, or, withdrawing them, under the threat of the Afigbh allegiance being from that date transferred to our enemies. The embasies at Cabul and Candaha are pieces of unwisdom still more grievous than the concession of the subsiday. The results are inexitble. "Affairs of gallantry " in a comtry where fema2 , charms are much more irresistible than feale virtue, and where suspicion is always avenged by blood, are sure to eventuate in murder, to be followed by a war of retribution. These are matters in reference to which there can be no uncertainty if we persevere; our ony1 hope is to abandon or reverse our present poliey before it be too late. The happy arrangements just entered o, with the Shah ought to be made the pretext for our abadoning at once all the plans proposed with the Ameer_ Turn next to China. We surely must on this occasorn exact something more from the Emperor than the mere opening up of an eitrA eaport or a sum; in name of comPensation, for the charges of the war; and it would be wel to reflect at the outset what that something shori be. Chimerical as the proposal may seem, I would indst on the esablishment of a factory protected by a British garison within the walls of Canton, this being placed in connexion by covered way, or some other means, with anotiler fortre= outside the walls covering and commanding the latter, th, two being ready to bombard the town. The Xmperor should be made to py a sum sufficient for the constraction. of a railway between the nearest seaport and Pikin under some such system of arrangement as to give the allies the power of its constraction and management, while the free revenues accrued to the State. Until we have established the means of communicating freely with the cepital at a11 times a permanent goodunderstandingwith China is a thin not to be looked for, and it is the Chinese themselves wuho would be the gainers by the plans I have proposed.

THE MArNx LiQuoiR LAw.-The Ron. Neil Dow, the originator and strenuous advocate of the Maine Liqvor Law, arrived in Liverpool on Monday last by the Boyal Mail steamship Europa, having been Invited by the United Kirgdow Temperance Alliance to visit this country, for the purpose of making known the principles of the law, and of eetalling its operations and the present state of the prini p l of temperance in the United States. He was received on hoard by Mr. Samuel Pope, honorary secretary of the Allance, and several other wetl known temperanca advocates, and conducted to Brown's Temperance Coffeehouee, Clayton-square. On arrving at the hotel Mr. Pore proceeded formally to welcome the honourable gentleman, which, he said, he felt sincere pleasure and gratification in doing, the imore esecially at this time, when a statement made by Mr. J. B. &ough-namely, " th.t tle temperance cause in the United States was in a depressed state, that more lior was sold now than he had ever before known in Massachusetts, and that it was the same in the other States'-was being made very powerful use of hy the enemies of temperance. Mr. Pope, having read letters from the Earl of Harrington, Sir C. Tfrevelyang and Dr. Lees, expressing their regret that they were unable to meet Mr. Dow, then proceeded to trace the route which the hon. gentlemnan would probably take in his tour through this country. On Thursday Mr. Pope said he will attend a mneeting at Blanchester in the Free Trade-hall, and. on Friday a soir6c at the Town-hall, when it is expected 'bat upwards of a hundred of the chief co-operators ef the League will be present. In the following week he wi vii,t Preston, Bolton, and Bradford. Thence he wil proceed to Hluddersfield, Sheffeld, Leeds, and Glasgow, and. be will be present Ct the great annual assmblage of the Scottish Temperance League, who hold their meeting on. the 11th of May. He will then visit the lace districts, Derby, Nottinghbam, Leicester, thenoe to the Potteries and onto Birinngham. He will then go on to Londos, attend two meetings at Exeter-hall, and visiting Ipswich And Bristol he will return to Ma,chester,to be presentat the great ministerial conferencein favour of the principles of the League, which will be held there on the 10th, ilth, and. 12 of July next, and at which from 500 to 600 clergyTnenL of all denominations will be present. He will then, in. order, visit Maecle-field, the Hige ds, Carlisle, Edinburgh, Glsow, Paisley, Stirling, Dundea, Aberdeen. Dunfries, Newcxtie, Sunderland, Liverpool, Carnarvon, Dublin, Cork, the Lakes of Kllarney, Belfast, andl then bk to Mancbester, where the operatives will give him a farewell entertainment. After leaving Great Britain be wil attend the confereice at Frankfort and the a2icultural shor at Paris, w1ere the prize to be given by the Belgian Government for the best eSsay on intemperance on. the continent willbe avarded.

FOREIGN INT.LLIaENuZ. FRANCE. (mROM OUR OWVN CORRMONDNI.) [A portion of the following appeared In our seoond edition of YsterdY :-1 k'AEMS, AsRTh 21, 6 P.3. It is affimed that the Conference which took place yesterday at the Foreign-office on the Neuchbtel question made some progress towards its conclusion-I doubt whether I can add a satisfactory one. The Kiing of Prussia has, it is said, lowered his terms-that is, his demand for a DeCuDiary indemnity, anld it is possible that the imal sitting of the Conference may take place before the 1st of may. I have just heard that Dr. Kern has gone to Berne, or ison the point of going, to sbmit the result to the Federal Council. I fear I cannot say that either party will be content,-Switzerland because she has to pay something, and the King that he has not been able to screw out of Republican Helvetia the very last centime of his first demand. Formerly it was said " Point dargergt, point de Suisse." Switzerland would like to say now "Point de Suisse, ni point d'argent." Those who will be most delighted to get rid of the business are the gentlemen of the Conference, who have had the patience to listen to the dreary quarrelling of Dr. IKern and M. de Ratwzfeldt so long. I hear that orders have been despatched from Madrid to the Spanish seaports to suspend the preparations for the expedition against Mexico. I have already mentioned tat the difference was in a fair wsy towards an adjustment. The Jct6rncs- des Debats contains a long article on the affairs of Spain, and particularly on the Spanish elections. The article bears the signature of M. de Sacy, though I suspect that gentleman has had nothing to do with it beyond the n2me. It bears the old cachet too plainly to escape any one. The origin of the communication, however, is of little interest; it is more interesting to know that it is full of miisstatements. For instance, alluding to the defeat of the Liberal candidates, the Debats declares, with as much solemnity as if it believed every word of the matter, that they were defeated notwithstanding " the impartial and, so to speak, indifferent attitude of the Government." Again, it says, "the Government wished to allow public opinion to express itself with perfect independence." Now, the Debats has ever been one of the ablest supporters of constitutional government in the abstract, and I am certain it has not lo-t the hope of witnessing its revival some day in France. Did the liberty of the press exist in this country, and were the Debats to say what it thought, it would, I am equally sure, describethe election in France as little better than a farce, played with as much seriousness as such a performance can be got through with. If the Dgbats were asked whether moral pressure was exercised on the electors, it would answer in the affirmative, and, if it dared to be sincere, would denounce the system. What it would blame in its own country why should it extenuate, or rather extol, in Spain ? For it cannot be supposed for a moment that the Dgbats is ignorant of the real state of the case. It must be well aware of the flagrant frauds practised on the voting lists wherever a Liberal candidate presented himself. If it be alleged, as is often assumed, that Spain is as yet not prepared for representative government, it would be a fair subject for discussion. The same has been said of France, and there are men whose opinion is not undeserving of notice who think that her apprenticeship to rational freedom will not be at an end for many years to come. On this the DObats would probably hold a dilferent opinion. Be this as it may, it is a little too bad that so eminent an organ of the Liberal press should pronounce eulogies on the "perfect impartiality" of a Government which, a-, every man, woman, and child in Madrid, BP.rcelona, Saragossa, and, in fact, wherever Liberals presented themselves, knows, had recourse to the most flagrant practices to prevent them from voting. A letter from Milan of the lth Minst. informs us that a duel had just taken place there between a native of that city and an Austrian officer. The officer had been introduced to the civilian at the house of a Milanese family, and consequently considered that he was authorized to salute the other when he met him in the street. The young man, however, told the officer that he could not salute an Austrian. A discussion ensued, which ended in a hostile meeting. The duel was fought with pistols, but fortunately neither party was injured. The shareholders in several French joint-stock companies are beginning to lose patience at the losses they have sustained for some years past through the mismanagement of the directors of those companies. Several complaints have consequently been forwarded to the Procureur Imperial. One company, for constructing branch railwvays, is mentioned whose shares, isqsued at 100f., have fallen to 1Sf. The Imperial Attorney-General has ordered an inquiry, and is waiting the result. Three accountants are unremittingly employed in exam ing the accounts of one joint-stock manufacturing company, in whose hands several hardworking men were permitted as a great favour to deposit their savings of several years. If the reports current be true, many minor delinquents may possibly escape in consequence of some high names being, it is said, implicated. An unwillingness exists in certain quarters that the extent of the mischief should be known to thxe world. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received: "TOULON, APRL 20. "The Russian squadron entered the road,sead at3o,ololck, under salutes from the forts. The Grand Duko Constantino landed at the Arsenal at 4 o'clock. He was received by the Maritime Prefect, tho Prefect of the Var, and Admiral Trohouart. No speech was delivered. Th;o weather is de. ligbtful, and the crowd i'nmense.

NAPLES, Akrm 13. .The - overnment of the Two Sicilies has at length met the accusation of torture which has recently been brought against it in foreign journals. The Offcia Joutrnal of Sicily of the 8th of April has a long article denying the accusation, and several copies of this number have been sent by Signor Carafa, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to each of the Foreign Ministers. By favour of one of them, I Pave a copy before me. The defer.ce appears to me to be weak and insufficient, and may be summed up tho:-" The prisoners did not make any revelation of their sufferings on trial. Torture, if possible, vould have been unnecessary for the purposes of justice. Giuseppe Lo Re, one of the persons said to be tortured, on being questioned by three foreignera in prison, had nothing but praises to lavish on his treatment." Such is the character of the defence eet up, and I do not thirnK it merit any further ana]ysis. As to the particular instance of torture now under discusion, I have not spoken of it, because I have not been in a position to collect any evidence on the subject; but, after much and varied inquiry among all clases and ranks of men, I have come to the painful conclusion that torture, in the proper sense of the term, is practised in the Two Sicilies. I would not willingly belie any man, much more the Government of a country, and it is an evidence of my caution that I expressed my doubts as to the application of torture to Agesilao Milano; but those doubts no longer exist, and the subject is now being brought before the world in so striking a manner that it is impossible for your correspondent to be silent. I shall be asked what foundation I have for my opinon, for, be it remembered, I assert nothing. The nature of the case does nbt permit of any otber than moral evidence being brought forward; demonstrative evidence is out of the question, but that moral evidence appears to me to be overwhelmingly strong. The general sentiment, though not decisive, has, and always should have, mauch weight, and that is in harmony with my own. Wherever I go I meet with people who express themselves most strongly on the case-Liberalz and Royalists have so spoken; and I have one instance noted,with names and dates, which was given to me by a firm and attached subject of Ferdinand II. Many other cases, with strong presumptive evidence, could I also mention, were it consistent with the safety of individuals. Dut, leaving general, let me speak of one particular instance, and it shall be that of Agesilao Bfilano. That that unfortunate man was tortured is the opin-on of Foreign Ministers, priests, military men, civilians, Liberals, and Royalists as well. This I say advisedly. Minute details have been given to me; those who have the best opportunities of knowing have so informed me, and there is such harmony in the various statements -which I havereceived as to leave no doubt of the fact on my own mind. I cannot publish the evidence, from fear of theconsequencesto individuals. Sergeant Grammis, suspected of having been inpiicated with Milano, is another instance of aman having been tortured, if strong moral evidence is to be received. Uhntil lately he has been in the prison of Santa Maria Apparents; now he is removed to the Vicaria, I am informed, the shadow of his former self-a dying man. Of how many more nvctims might I speak, did prudence permit it I Incidents of suffering, for the truth of which one right safely vouch, crowd upon me, though they may not be written; but they will assuredly be brought to light, to the confusion of those who have perpetrated or Sanctioned such barbarities. My remarks hitherto have had a reference to tortu as applied to politlcal offenders; but there is equally strong (if not stronger) reason to suppose that it is applied to common delinquents. The horrible case known here as the caue of Canosa, in 1828, is well known. To come down still later, what is called the " Causa del Campo," which took place, I believe, in the year that the Scienziati Itallani visited Naples, excited great attention. Another case, within a year, In which 28 persons were put upon their trial for various robberies, also afforded, it is said, indubitable proof of the use of torture. " Those who have the beat opportunities of knowing," said a highly intelligent and well-inform.ed man to me, " have not the shadow of a doubt on the subject; and, if torture be used in ordinary cases of crhne, be assured it is used in cases of political offences." I shall have occasion however, to return to this subject; and, in fact, I rather hasten my notice of the charge of torture against the Neapolitan Government' for the reason that the Palemw Journa has taken it up. A clear understanding of the subject would require a definition of the term " torture." If by it is meaut the punishment of the wheel, or other brutalities of a similar character, practised in the middle ages, I do not beheve that it exists; but I believe that ferocious beating is inficted-that denial of food is resorted to, almost to starvation. I have heard of people being supplied with wine instead of water. I holieve that the coldest water is from time to time thrown upon the body, and a firm supporter of the King told me last summer of a man who was bound naked to a pillar, -which was kept damp by the continued application of cold water. These things I believe, for yhave the evidence noted down, with names and addresses, andthough in many cases I may have been deceived, still it isnot likely that I should have been so in all. On very strong apparent evidence I have heard of worse cases stil of torture, but humanity shudders at them, and I will try not to believe them. There is, however, undeniably a worse kind of torture constantly applied here,worse, because it is less direct and less tangible; of instances of this kind I 7ksow a thousand. The denunciations of the secret spy-the brutalities of the police-the daily illegalities and acts of injustice whichare committed-mensnatchedfromthe bosoms of their families on suspicion merely, degraded from their position, imprisoned, exiled for months and years without trial,-these are facts which no one dare deny, and which fill the hearts of thousands of innocent persons with sorrow. Is it no torture, too, that political prisoners confined in Mtontesarchio are compelled to wear their chains when they are only fit for a hospital, and that one of them, Zeuli by name, who died last summer of consump'ion,wore his chains when a mere skeleton ? Of these facts the most indisputable evidence exists, A more delicate point remains to be touched upon. As a rile, I have considered it more delicate to abstain from introducing the name of the highest person in the realm into these disc,ssions, nor do I consider it relevant to the subject. If the facts be established, that is all that Is required. Suffering is not diminished by the assurance that the Sovereign does not know it. Establish the facts, and the necessity is forthwith established for a thorough change in the system and form of government which has permitted even the suspicion of such enormities. Little disposed as I am to indulgence, though very much to honesty, in my views of the affairs of Naples, I would willingly hope that torture, if it does exist, as I firmly behleve it does, is the relic of a barbarous age, rather than the invention of one called civilized-that it is a part of a system long pursued here, and so moulded into that system as to form a necessary pat of it in the opinion of underlings; I will refuse to believe that the highest personage in the realm can sanction it, but I do believe that it is practised directly and indirectly to the fiull extent which I have stated, and I should sin against trath, justice, and humanity if I did not state my impression. The Government of the Two Sicilies is put upon its trial by the press of Europe, and it is a great point gained to civilixation that it has consented to appear atlthe bar. There isanother point gainedhere, consolatoryto Mr. Gladstone and to all who dare speak the truth, and that is, that efforts are being made to improve the state of the prisons. Success has attended the effort hitherto, but I must treat the subject more in detail at some future time ; meanwhile consider my allusion to it as evidence of a disposition to speak imparialy and truthfully. Two works now in circulatLon have just been brought to me-one of which is entitled " The Praises of the King of Naples in the EngEsh Parliament." It was printoed here, and opens thus- " To-dav the praises of Ferdinand II. the In- trepid (such is the name reserved for him by dispassionate and trathful history) shal be sung, not ly us, bit we will hear them sung in England, In London, in the English Parliament, by members of the Houses of Lords and Cormons, by Lord Derby, Lord John Russell, Gladstone, Disraeli, and Milner Gibson. Lot uslistento them." Such is the happy influence which those statesmen are now exercisng on Naples, and such the pro-d title they have ace quired-the Defenders of the King of Naples I As many as 10,000 co ies have been printed. The Five per Zents. were done at 110. Ex. change on London, 540. APRL 15. From all I cai gather, the position of affairs ii more interesting than it has been for some time, and reports have been circulated, therefore, to the effect that all the difficulties are nettled, or other- wise, according to the party prejudices or wishes of individuals 1 believe, however, that the true stats of the case is as follows :-The Prussian Minister has long laboured to bring His Majesty to more conciIiatory sentiments; certain propositions were submitted which were entirely changed, but I be- lieve that nothing more has been gained up to the plesent time than an unwilling consent t treat onL a mIost iasufficient basis. What I know is this, that a gentleman went to pay his repectatothe Kig this week,intendingto leaveNaplea;heorderedagaiu to the Palace,and then coomletelychan ediavout. for Paris, and perhaps for Lndon. eis oenda message in cipher from Paris soon after his ar- rival, which is to be taken immediately to Signor. Carafa, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I believa this gentleman left on Thursday, and a deapatce' may consequently be expected in a day or two The Government, it wouad appear, still cherzih3i its intention of transporting many of those in prison to the Argentine Republic, and bas put in comrnission two 60-gun vessels, the Parthenope and 'thea Regina. Negot.iatoions were tobe concluded to-'day. by General Bracia for chartering ten of the bess and most nolid merchant vessels of the Neapoli- tan marine. Four of those vessels belong' to., Sorrento, the remainder to Procida, united with two of Sicily. The negotiations have been going on since last Thursday. The expedition for the Argentine Republic is to be wholly completed by the 10th of April. The two armed vessels are to act as a convoy. The expenditure which the' Neapolitan Government will make for this expedition; including the armament of thefrigates, exceeds 300,000 ducats. In the arsenal 382 menare working night and day in getting these veMels ready. 'he political prisoners in the bagni of the two portions of the kingdom who have accepted the offer to leave the courntry do not exceed, I am' told, 23; but there are a number of soldiers, amounting to upwards of 300, who have lately been turned out of the army on suspicion and sent to the Islands, who .will be sent of. It is the intention, say some of my informints, to send 2,000 persons Therd ii no reason why it shoul.d not send 10,000 off, having the powrer to do so, and no conscience to control that power; but, voluntarily, few of the political prisoners will leave. M. Falcon, the Consul for the Argentine Republic, is in daily communication with General B3ro and Signor Carafa. It is this treaty which has been put forward as the basis of negotiations between our Government and the Two Sicilies. Should it receive the sightest counterance from our Government it wil cover it deservedly with shane. The treaty is nothing more than an Act for tranporting all who may have been condemned or sniply shut up as obstacles to the free course of the present system of government. It substitutes perpetual exile for im.- prisonment. It is a punishment unknown to the law. It moreover acts, not only against those whci have been tried and condemnedo (whatever the naturef of that trial may have been), but against deten4ti olti&i, men who havebeen laid hold of withoutany reason being assigned and without being subjected to any tWial. - Supposing that no force be used, and that many voluntaily leave the country to avoid a larder fate, no political amelioration will be effected by it, but the contrary. Arbitrary power will be yet stronger, because it wiU have less to dread, and in a short time exerescences as frightful as those of which the Argentine Treaty wi have relieved it wil be formed again. It is mortifying to think it even possible that by sending backher Legation England can lend her countenance to a measure which would be cruel and unjust in principle, and perfectly ineffective for good. Shame enough would it be had ourGovernment never interfered; but, having interfered-having denounead EO stongly the system pursued here and raised the hopes of the Italians, then to become parties to an Act for transportation is enough to make every Englishman in Italy ashamed of his name. I speak thus strongly from having witnemsed tl.e hopes which have been ralsed,-from a knowledae of the almost incredible evihs under which the country is suffering, and a strong conviction of what must be the remedies applied. An insufficient settlement, or worse than insufficient, il only give rise to new complications and conspiracies, and Murat, or any othername, will be the rallying cry. Domiciliary visits have been repeated within a few days on suspicion of Mfuratism, and several arrests have been made. A poor man called Pisani has been arrested, charged with havIng printed the "hoae" decree. An order has been Issued for the expulsion of all the provincial students, so I am informed, within 24 hours after the receipt of their passports; those who can find bondsmen may remain eight days. A Captain Favallo, formerly attached to the same regiment as that to which Agesilso Milano belonged, has just been deprived of his commission. Passing over these minor facts, I must now again call your attention to the affair of the Concordat. I believe now that my first impression and information were perfectly correct, and that, if not a new one, a very considerable modification of the old Concordat is now under discussion. At various times demands have been made by the bishops for an enlargement of their privileges. There was a conference of prelates in 1849 onthat subject in Naples, and various rimostra=e, now before me, were drawn up and presented to Tls Majesty. Circumstances have appeared recentlyto favour the renewal of such efforts, and complaints were made to Rome that the existing Concordat required much alteration. The comnmission which I have mentioned several times has been the consequence. It is impossible to speak with any cer4winty of the subject-matter of the discussions, but those who are in a position to know tell me that the following questions have been mooted,-the abolition of civil ma,riages, the erection of an ecclesiastical tribunal, and the revision of education and of books printed since 1.799. I perceive that Art. 12 of the rimostranze is thus expressed .-" It is greatly to be desired that penal csues against ecclesiastics should be tried with closel doors." The Royal answer by the side was, " Let the law have its course." The clergy are, however, always struggling to acquire fresh privileges, and the modifications now demanded will no doubt be to the advantage of the Church, and of a most retrograde tendency. Other people tell me that the changes suggested affect the Royal exequatur. The King is fond of power, has always resisted any encroachmients upon it, and I have therefore a greater diffioulty in accepting this solution of the question. The feeling in Sicily by those well capable of judging is, I am told, one of the strongest hatred and disgust towards this Government. Messina was patrolled day and night by the military. The title of the pamphlet to which I alluded as having been sent by authority into Sicily is, " situatio; PolitiTqe de 1'Angleterre et sa Conduite Machiavelique d t'(gard des Puissances Europ6ennes, et enparti cuiaer delaFrance, son Alliie dans la Chterre d'Orient." It has already been circulated widely in Naples by police agents. The Neapolitan Government complains of the press of England. That press is at least open in its charges, while that of Naples has been for this many a month and year working under ground against England in defiance of all truth and decency. AvaM 16.

From this report it appears3that at the commencement of 1855 there were 359 kilometres of GoverJnment railway in use, to which were added 15 more during the months of MIay and June of that year, giving a total of 374 kilometres, thegrosreceipts from whichaInoun~tedo10,16,778f. 89c., and the expenditure thereon to 5,221,598f. 6Sc., leaving a net produce of 4,940,180f. 26c. In this return no account is taken of the advantages derived by the State in the transport, either g,ratuitously or at half-price, of military, of prisoners, of salt and tobacco, and of the service of the post-office, advantages which represent a sum of 610,000f. The average gaross profit per kilometre was about 28,246f., and the expense 14,514f., leaving a profit of 13,732f. per kilometre. From these returns we learn that a train between Turin and Genoa costa 4f. 15c. per kilometre, and produces 8f. 51c. Between Alessandria and Arona the cost is 3f. i1c., and the receipts 5f. 41c. Bctween Toxrin and Susa it is 3f. 23c. to Sf. 8ic.; between Turin and Pinerola, 2f. 92c. to If. 47c.; and between Mortara and Vigevano, 2f. 95o. to 3f. 29c., giving an average expense of 3f. 7Sc., and a receipt of 7f. 30c.3 or an averag,e profit of 3f. SSc. per kilometre for each train. It must be borne in mind that all these calculations refer to a year of war, when the prices of coal and machinery were greatly augmented, and the freight from England nearly double the ordinary rate, so that it may fairly be expewted the returns of 1856 will show a considerably increased profit, even supposing there should have been no increase of traffic, which is not likelyv. A. pictorial- iitry abum ol the Crimean expedition has just been published here, by order of the Mfinister of War, from drawings made by the Staff Corps. It ia divided into three parts. The first contains plans of the camps and establishments, showing the general plan and oven details of the hospitals, huttings, and fortifications thrown up towards the Tchernaya, &rc. The second contains drawings or panoramnas of the headquarters of the Sardinian armny and the camps of the difflerent divisions. The third containa sketehes of the 'r&cxrnaissance of the Sardinian troops in the Valley of Baidar, of the movements towards Tehuliu, and those on the heights of Belbok, of the battle of the Tchernaya, and of the works of attack and defence at Sebastopol. The whole is admirably executed, both in drawing and engraving, and forms a worthy memorial of the corps from which it emanates, as well as of the Sardinian army in general. Notwithstanding the very backward state of all agricultural proceedings, izu consequence of the late cold winds, with rain, which succeeded some comparatively mild weather at the beginning of the month, and althoug,h the mulberry trees have hardly yet begun to bud, it is maid that many engagements have already been made for cocoons at the rate of 75f. the miria. A great improvement is being mntroduced here in machinery for winding and spinning silk direct from the cocoons, according to an Invention of Mr. Dickens, of Middleton, near Manchester, the machinery for wh ich has been manufactured by Messrs. Cordon and Co., of Stockport. Some of the principal manufacturers in this country speak most favourably of this system, of the working of the machinery, and the superior quality of the silk produced by it. I have lately seen an imnmense building in course of construction at Novara for the purpose of carrying out this system on a very extensive scale. It is the property of a company presided over by the Cavaliere Rossi, the Syndic of that town, and is so built that, if desired, it can boe increased to four times its present size wvithout inconvenience, but even in its existing proportions it will have 12,000 spindles, driven by twvo 12-horse power condensing engines, and employ between 800 and 400 hands. Mfr. Emerson, of the firm of Gordon and Co., is superintending the arrangements for carrying out the building and putting up the machinery, which, it is hoped, will he ready for the coming crop, and which, if successful, is likely to effect a perfect revolution in the silk manufacture of this country. The principal advantages expected from this system are-the power to reel at all seasons any kind of cocoons not positively injured; to reel with lukewarm water; to employ children as operatives; to obtain a more even and elastic thread; a certainty of the mninimumr of twrist required, thereby avoiding excess; the power to disengage or set in motion any one of the spindles n bobbins without stopping the remainder; a greater extraction of silk from the cocoons;and a vast economy in cost of machinery, in wages, Iin space, and in flower. The Grand Duke of Tuscany has caused the following circular to be addressed to all officials in his dominions:- "Sir,-His Imperial and Royal Highness the Grand D)Ul~ penetrated by the increasing necessity of treserving In th State, and chiefly in the churches and other public establishments, those preious objects of art with which the genius or the religious piety of our ancestors enriched the country, while desirous of reinforcing the disposition of the anscient and existing ordinances, together with all those ultsrior provisions that may be judged efficacious to the same object, deEires also that the vigilance and ener cr of the judicial, political, and administrative authorities should be exerted, in order that in every case the most vigorous and exact observance of the superior ordinances rmay accrue therefrom to the law of the 26th of December, 1754, revived by t'he Iaws and Custom-house Tariff of the 30th of August, 1781, and the 18th of October, 1791, recalled in vigour by the notification of the 9th of May, 1814,snd .%ueceinegordinancesdbh s ositionofwhich it is forhidden to export from the State ancient picture without a special license; and to the dispositiors pnblished by the notificationi of the Imperial Royal Conan t;a dated the 23d of October, 1818, by wvhich was confirmed the already existing laws on the inalienability of the mon- ments of art belonging to Royal or publc esablishraents and religious places depending on the same; and the prohibition to alienate siuilar objects was extended to churohes and their dependencies; whoever might be the Patron, to religious corporatiors, to consrvators, to bositls, and in general to all establishments, whether ecclesiastical or of public piety, unless an express authorization should have been accorded in the manner and resiectively under the penalties laid down in the rotification itself.

The firat YA4tind ci the regular eson offerod neveral points of interest. There was , new work of imporknoe by a composer of distinguished )nerit-Herr Moliq; au a. new pianist, Mademoiselle Anus Molique, hui you ngstdaughter. There was Wo Signor Bottei, with his marvellots contrbasso, which had tot been heard inee lat year and, in addition, a capital programme, as the following wil show:- Quate, No. 6 (in c) ..oz TriO MS, Op. 52 4u r ...... Mollque. Double Quartet, Op. 58 (in D) . Spohr. 8O-4Gonk*baseo . .otlcL The quarte-in many respects the most bily finished of the JCt of six with which XosAzr took such pains, ad which he wrote with such enthusim, sinoe they wero destined to be inscribed to his great CQntemporary Haydn, from whonx the author of Don Giovanni learned something in the beginning, bat who learned more from the author of Dons Giovanni in the end-the quartet in C major, the last of the glorioas suite, is always welcome, and doubly so when rendered with irreproachable neatnets and precision, combined with undeviating purity of expression, as by Herr Molique and his coadintors on the present occasion. Equally tcoeptable in another way was the eleao. rate double quaTtrt of Spohr, who may be said to have invented ane brongat to perfecton the form of chamber music of which this i so striking an example. No one plays Spohr with more judgtuent and accuracy, or more exactly in the manner adopted by that great master himself, than Molique, who, though a considerably younger man, bps long been regarded bly German critics, from a certain Point of view, as Spohr's only rivaL The two parties thus divided :-First uartet-Herren molique, Ries, Gofrie, and Signor Piath; second quartet-Mr. Blagrove, Herr Pollitzer, Mr. R. Blagrove, and iiL Paque. The execution throughout -was first-ate, the quartet led by our eminent Blnglish violinist proving itself in even respect a worthy companion to the other (more formidable in conspicuors names) dirccted by the renowned kapallmeimscr from Stuttgart. The effect was equallyigood (because the playing was equally carefulandexac9t)hen the two qurrtets were, so to say, contending against each other separtely for the palm, andwhen they Iboured simultaneously in a grand ensemble-like enemies, who, esteeming each other, forget their differences and unite in perfect amity. The whole work was listened to with such dMight that the dyrector of fhe Musical Union may safely repeat it (or-better, perhaps -try another of the set-the splendid ene in B minor, for instance) at a future " s6anc" The new trio of Herr Holique was received with the utmost favour, and the execution of the pianoforte part by Mademoiselle Anna Molique afforded unanimous satisfac. tion. NTothing could be clearer, more unaffected, or in better taste than her entire performance and this demands the higher praise since the trio is not only extremely diflicult quand mie, but is by no means witten for the piano in a grteful or convenient manner. Herr lWolique's pasages are not quite so awkward and so out of sorts with the genius of the instrument as those of Dr. Spohr, but they are often very nearly so, and give the pianist a larger amount of trouble than the most dBicult musio of composers who, themselves pianists, know how to a^commodate the executant by consulting the niechanical peculiarities of the key-board. What may be the general merits and Attainments of Mademnoiselle Anna Molique we are unable to decide until we have an opportunityof heainng ker in other thingp. The impression she created in her father's trio, however, s such as to justify flattering anticipations of her cAreer. She was powerfully supported by Herr Molique and Sigpor Platti, and warmly encouraged by the audience, who loudly a"plauded her at the end of every one of the four movements. Of the trio itself we can only say just now that, like all the essays of its author, it everywhere exhibits ingenious contrivance, thorough intelligence of form, and a rofound acquaintance with those principles of art which if rejected or ignored music becomes no better than an incoherent succession of chords and phrases n short, it is the work of a master, whatever may be thought of its originality-a point which, together with its other characteristics, cannot be fairly dscussed on the strength of such a superficial knowledge as may be obtained in one hearin. Signor Bottesini played a slow movement, in which e enraptured and astonished-his hearers by a dispy of won. desfEl execution, united to unrivalled beauty of tone and phraing and a great variety of peculiar effecct, through means of whicb, besides enlarging its sphee,he ha imparted to the double-bass a totlly nev And unprecedented character. He was accompanied by a stringed quartet, and honoured with unanimous applause at the conclusmon. On the whole this was one of the best coneorts ever given by the Musical Union. At the next matine Madame Clara (Wieck) Schumann is to be the pianist and Herr Ernst the violinist.
EQUALIZATION OF THE POOP-RATE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TES. Sir,-I should not have ventured to addres you on a topia so difficult to deal with, and surrounded by interests so confficting. as that which heads this communication, but from the circumstance that my name has been mentioncd by you (March 12) with reference to one branch of the general question. That which I now propose to deal witlh is the plan propounded by the Association for the Equalization of the Poor-rates throughout the Metropolis, and regarding whichI can only arrive at the conclusion adopted in yomr own admirable leading article on the subject, that "u ntil uniformity of aessment be obtained, either by the voluntary action of parishes, or by the interference of the Legislature, there can be little hope of any prac tical equalUzation of poor-rates." I must confess I do not quite understand the plan upon vhich the association propose to proceed in the event of poor-rates being equalized throughout the meatropolis. Is it intended that the metropolis shall be rooulded as one vast union, and to abolish the hatsful law of settlement within that area ? Or is it intended to retain the unions as at present constituted, they paying their quotas towards one common pmuse, and drawing from time to time on the same according to the wants of their local poor? These are matters somewhat of detail, it is true, but nevertheless it would perhaps be well that they were suffciently defincd and understood, and until they are I, for one, cannot auive at any conclusion whether the plan proposed is a sound one or not, although every re. flecting person must admit the present inequality of poorrates is a great social hardship, pressing unduly upon classes who can il sUppoxl the burden. It should not be lost sight of asaningredientin the argument that thegreatandeconomaic principle of local self-government must be interfered with or damped by any plan extending the rea of rating from parishes either to unions containing several parshes or to the metropolis, whose parishes are almos0 countless, by reimoving that stimulus which now exists among guardians for protecting the interests of the parishes they represent by strict economy in management; they would no longer, in fact, represent parishes though elected by them; they would be diluted in the great parochial sea of the metropo. is, and consequently excess of expenditure would very likely ensue from the absence of active local controL I do not allude to these inevitable results as reasons against the adoption of equalization of the poor-rates; better far that our management were even a txifle more expensive than that the social injustice now prevail;ug from inequality of the poor-rate should any longer continue; my objection is that the plan does not go far enough. If the principle is once conceded that an equalization of the poor-rate in desirable, and, moreover, if it is once determined that a great revolution in the value of real pro. perty shall take pla^e, which is an inseparable result, and which renders the matter in this point of view a freeholders' or landlords question, then, I think-, we can. not equitably stop short with the metropolis, but must in common fairness extend the principle tothe whole kingdom. It has already been attempted to be shown that if the area Cf rating as now constituted be enlarged the evil of expensive management must be the penalty inevitably incurred in the transition, by removing nearly all motive for economy from guardians, while, by extending the principle to the whole kingdom, it may be pointed out that the law of settlement, so harsh in its nature, so cruel to the poor, and so difficult in its administration by guardians, might be simultaneously abolished. There is one great political evil, or demon, as it is considered in the eyes of some, likely to be encouraged in no little degree by the national plan of rating to the poor-viz., the system of Government centralition. I know not how this could in any way be avoided, unless certin established areas of rating for otber purposes were selected, such as counties; these are natural and long recognized limits, where property is already, according to a tolerably uniform standard, assessed to thbe county rats. Why should not the same principle he applied to rating for the relief of the poor ? Large towvis like the metropolis might, if necessary, be declared for such purposes as counties within themselves,-although I cannot but think tbat, as large towns necessarily have cast upon them more tnan their fair sharo of raral paupexism, it would, on the whole, be fairer to rate them according to a uniform assessment as part of the counties in which they are situated. I submit the above remarks as an instalment towards the consideration of this important question, and am, Sir, Yonr VA-v oAhi.Ai-+t .r n JOSHUA W.

In this case the guardians of the poor of Birmingham had assessed the Binningham postmaster, John Smith, to the poor-rate in respect of his occupation of the Birmingham post-office. The case now Ltated for the opinion of the Court raised the question, whether the postmaster, or any other person, had such a beneficial occupation of the premises as would render him liable to the rates. It appear, d that Her Majesty's Postmaster Gereral was a body corpo. rate, and had power to take land for public purposes, aud under these powers he had taken a lease for 30 years of a bulding, formerly called the Royal Hotel, at Birmingham. The ground floor of the building was row used as a posioffice and money order-offlce, and the upper part was let ofl, and used as an office by the Inland Revenue Department. Postage-stm,nps were sold at the post-offi-e, and, instead of delivering all tho letters at the places to which they were directed, an arrangement had been made by which the letters directed to certain manufacturers and merchants at Birmingbam were deposited in pigeorholes in the office, and then delivered to the agents of the pcrties. Payments were made for this accommodation, but the money accruing which amounted to from 300OI to 5CO, a-year, went into '.a general fund of the Post-offlce. 3 Mr. PAS11LE, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Bittleston), in support of the rate, contended that the case came within the principle laid down in "Gambler *. Lidwood." The Postmaster-General was rateable on the ground that a profit was made by the land on which the pigeonholes were erected, this beiig a work of supererogation not required Ir. J. WILDE, Q.C. (with whom was MIr. Poulden), contended that there was no beneficial occupation by any one. Lord CAIPIiELL said, he should be glad if a general lawv were passed, that when property was taken for public purposes it should remain subject to the burden of the poor-rates, as it had been before; for there was a great hardship on parishes where property contributing to the relief of the poor was so taken and exempted from rateability. The effect was; to throw a still greater burden on the ratepayers. But, as the lawv now stood, where property was in the possession of the Crcwvn for public purpoees it was exempted from rattability and no property was liable to be rated unless there was a subject who had a oeneficial occupation. Who, then, was the occupier of the Birmiingham Post-office 9 Not the letter-carrierS, nor the clerks, or the postmaster. It vas said that tbe Postmaster-teneral was liable. But how was the Duke of Ar ll the occupier? He held his office during the pleasure of Her Majesty, and occupied the building merely for public purposes There waS no difference be. tween this case and that of gaolE, courts of justice, the ccurts in Westminster-hall, and the office where a Sewretary of State attended in discharge of his public duty. A1. tbese were instances of ptoperty occupied by the Crown by the servants of the Crown, and applied to public purposes. Thecaseof "Gambierv.Lidwood" (3E.asdB.B 346), was distinguishable. In that came the oonduetors of & prion had attached to it a fam, which the Courtzeprded in the Dature of an agricultural specultion.

C., obtained a role nisi for a nonsuit, on the grounds that the direetors of the Royal British Bank had refused to consent to the transfer tendered before the plaintiffs paid the money, and that it was the duty of the plaintiffs to procure the consent; and, secondly, that the transfers tendered were not in the name of Russell, the party with whom the plaintiffs had made the contract, and that Russell was not a sbareholder at the time. Mr. ATr=ToN, Q.C. (Ur. Aston with himn), showed Cause yesterday against the rule. It appeared that the order for the purchase of the shares was given on the 28th of August for the settling day on the 15th of September - that the bank stopped payment on the 3d of September, v hen the defendant desired the plaintiffs to dispose of the shares, which they endeavoured to do in vain; that Russell. a dealer on the Stock-Exchange, v,th whom the plaintiffs had contracted for the shares, afterwards tendered a transfer, and called on the plaintiffs to complete the purohase; that in accordance with the crstom of the market the plintiffs paid the money, the committee of the StockExohange refusing to interfere. The defendant afterwards repudiated the bargain, relying on the inability of the vendor to give him possession of the shares in question with the consent of the directors to the transfer. In the course of the argument " Sutton v. Tatham" (10 AdoL and El,), "BaVley v. Butterworth," and "Boeanquet v. Shortridge" (24 . J.), were rehed on. Mir. IKNOwLxs, Q.C. (with whom were Mr. Mande and Mr. P. Gibbons), appeared to.day in support of the rule, and contended that, as the plaintiffs were not compellable at law to pay Russell, the defendant was not bound to indemnify him - that the plaintiff was entitled to a valid transfer from itussell, and not a transfer so caled; that the consent of the directors was a condition precedent; and that tho atatuto of tho 7th and 5th of Vi-toria, sAp. 112, required that the consideration should be truly stated, which, as RuqseU was not the actual transferer, had not been done. Assuming that the plaintiffs were acting under instructions froma the defendant, they bad not obeyed those instructions in paying money on a transfer in which the provisions of the statute and the conditions of the bank's deect of settlement had not been strictly complied with. "Sho tridge v. Bosanquet" (16 L. 3.), IIBowlby v. Bell" (30. B.,284), "R Iibblewhite v. M'Morim" (6 M. and W.), " WiMinson v. Lloyd" (7 Q. B., 27), Paruther v. Gaitskell" (13 East, 432), " Lloyd v. Crisp" (5 Tauntt., 250), 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 113), were referred to in argumnent. The COURT, in giving judgment, said the action was for money paid to the defendant's use, and the onestion was whether the plaintlff received any authority, ex-press or implied, to purchase the shares on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff was employed to purchase shares in a chartered joint-stock bank, and the purchase was made in the usual way and according to the practice of the Stock-Exchange. The defendant had employed the plaintiff to make purchases for him before on the Stock-Exchange according to the practice of the Stock-Exchange, and he must be taken to nave given the plaintiff on this occasion authority to purchase these shares according to the practice which prevailed on the Stock-Exchange. That being so, and the plaintiff having acted on the authority so given to him by the defendant was entitled to recover the money he had paid for the price of the shares. The only point about which the Court had any doubt was whether the defendant had got what he contracted for on the ground of the bank having stopped payment on the 3d of September. But that objection could nou prevail, because, although the bank had stopped, it still existed and might resume payment. It could not, therefore, be said that the defendant had not got what he contracted for, especially as in these bargains for a future day there was always a certain degree of speculation as to whether the value of the shares would rise or fall. As to the point made that the contract was to transfer shares belonging to Russell, it did not follow that the shares should absolutely belong to Russell. The rule must therefore be discharged.-Rule discharged. COCKERELL V. AU COMPTE. The question raised in this case was as to the liability of a member of a coal society for the supply of a large quan. tity of coals furnished to the society, the contract having been entered into by the secretary of the society on behalf of the society, under the sanaction of a resolution made according to the roles of the societv. Mr. KoNouLrs, Q.C., and Mr. S};IN2;BR showed cause against a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant; and Mr. UDALL appeared in support of it. The COURT took time to consider its judgment. (Sitfti-ns at Zisi PriS, at Westminster, bCfie Mr. JTustice WILLIAIIS and Common Juries.) GAUNTLETT V. KING ANiD ANOTHER. Mr. Morgan Lloyd wes counssl for the plaintiff, and Mr. Henr; James for the defendants. This was an action brought by the jlaintiff to recover damages against the defen ants for hav-pg distrained upon ce' Wn property belonging to tiu for having seized certain things which were not legaUy distrainable, one of the defendants, King, acting as broker to the other defendant, Elliott, who was the plaintiffs landlord. After a long and uninteresting trial it was ascortained that ibe articles illegally seized consisted of two gas burners, a few keys, and possibly some books; but as to the latter items some legal doubts existed, for the solution of which the parties were referred to the Court in baneco. The jury found a verdictfor the plaintiff, and assessed the damages as follows:-In respect of the seizure of the gas burn'ers they a.warded the sum of 17., for the keys as., and for the detention of the plaintiff's books 40s. Mr. MORCAN LLOYD applied to the learned judge for a ceorificate that the cause was a fit one to be tried in a superior court. Mr. Justice WILLI.TAS said that if Mr. Lloyd succeeded in retaining his verdict for the 40s. he would grant such certificate, but not otherwise, leave being given to the defendants to move on several points taken at the trial. The Court then proceeded to dispose of the lAst case on the list, but no point of general interest arose during the trial. The Court will sit at Guildhall to-morrow (this day), and again at Westminster next Monday.

CONSISTORY COURT. WEDNESDAV A PTT. 99 ULIAI'5BEL V. CA1.IFBRT.T. (Before Dr. L1SIn1GTON.) .Ur. LUSrMnGTO'o delivered judgment in this case, the facts of which wexe zeported in The Times of the 21st ult Before be addressed himself, bo said, to the particular circmnstancea of the case, he thought it right to make a few observations upon the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 47, which directed a particular mode of taking evidence in Lcclesisatical Courts whioh did not exist before. He was not surprised that there had not been a clear understanding as to that statute, because it gave no directions whatsoever as to the manner in which its provlsions should be carieed into execution. It was manifest that it embraced the whole of the case from the beginning to the end. The case miliihl be heard entirely vir4 ooce, or in part by depouition or affildavit, ard the CoDrt was At lit3rty, even after there had been depositions orffidavits, to exatnethe p3rsonswho msdethemvivivdvomItapp3aredadv;bleunder thosedirem stances that all the pleadings should be concluded before any evidence was received. 'With regard to the proof of adultery in the present case, it appeared to bim wholly unnecexsry to enter into any detail of the evidence; indeed it was not and could not ba contended that the proof of ce,minal ittercourse was not clear and deciive. The parties were originally resident in Australia. In 1856 Mrs Campbel1, with six children, left Australia, and arrived in this country in April. Mr. Smith, who had beerrin partnership ,with Mr. Campbell, received her, and took her to lodgings at 17, Blooefield-road. Mr. Garstin immediately made his appearance and became an inmate of that house. There was no ditect evidence how that acquaintance commenoed; but from the declaration of Mrs. Campbell sbe and her children received much attention from him during the voyage from Australia. Mr. Garstin remained in that bouse with Mrs. Campbell about a fortnight, and in the beginning of May she with her children removed to Cravenstreet, and there they found Mr. Garstin. On the 6th of May Mrs. CampbeU went to No. 41 in the same street, and at NSo. 41 lr. Garstin wasfolud again. On the 27th of?M&y 30rr. Campbell arrived from Australia and joined his wife in Csaven-street. About the 6th of June, having taken a house in Porchester-terrace, he removed his children, but Mra. Campbell refused to accompany him. A few days afterwards a sister of Mrs. Campbell arrived In London, and by the joint persuasion of that sister and Mr. Smith Mrs. Campbell was induced to Join her husband in Porcheste.- terrace. According to the evidence o' 3Mr. Smitb, some time after Mrs. Campbell had gone to Porchester-terrace, circumstances came to Mr. Camnpbell's knowledge which induced him to prosecute further inquiries. The result was that Mrs. Campbell left Porchester-terrace and went to the Colonnade Hotel, whence she 'was removed by Mr. Campbell to Hampetead, and there, so far as related to the intercourse between Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, the history ended -rather abruptl. That was in July. There was evidence oel. livinga in of MIrs. Cap living in various lodgings up to November and Mr. =arstin constantly being with her. He was not about to recapitulate the acts of indecent familiarity or the circumstanceswhieh led to the con. clusionthat nn adulterousintercoursewas carried on between the partics; the proof of guilt was nndeniable. Then, what werethe circumstances in this case which should inducethe Court to delay pronouncing a decree of separation? The evidence already produced on the part of Mrs. Campbell clearly would not suffice to establish condonation. Did justice require that he should delay the decision of the cause until witnesses were examined in Australia and in Italy? 'Upon what were they to be examined? Not to prove Mrs. Campbell's innocence-guilt was admitted, andthe question was condonation. What was condonation? Connubial intercourse, with full knowledge of past adultery. It 'was pleaded on behalf of Mrs. Campbell that from the 26th of Iune and for several days afterwards Mr. Campbell visited his wife at the Colonnade Hotel, was seen to approach her for the purpose of kissing her, spoke of having a bed made up for him in his wife's bedroom ; that he remained in her Ibedroom for several hours and renewed conjugal intercourse. These avenments were contradicted in plea byMr. Campbell who averred that he never saw Mrs. Campbell at thathoteo except in the presence of witnesses. Looking at the evidence the Court was left somewhat in the dark as to what took placo at that hotel, and certainly, so far as appeased, Mr. Campbelldid not act under the circum. stances with great discretion in having those interviews with his wife. But looldng at the case as it stood, had the Court good reason to believe that if the delay asked were ranted the plea of condonation would be established ? He tad not from the pleading on the evidence the least reason to conclude that the witnesses now vouched would give any evidence material to the only issue remaining. It was the dut.v of the Court to discourage these delays, and, unless justice most clearly demanded it, to prevent a wife putting her husband to expenses, which might in some cases be ruinous. It was the complaint arising from expense and delay, vwhich had rendered it probable that the mnatrimonial jurisdiction would be withdrawn from these courts, and probably this might be almost the last case which he was called upon to decide. He waS satisfied that justice required him to reject the prayer of Mrs. Campbell, which he did not think 'was well founded, and which if granted to a wife admitted guilty would impose a most onerous expense on her husband and procrastinate this case to an indefinite period. He must conclude the cause and pronounce for the separation. M&GTIRE (LERn) V. DUDLEY AND CARTER. This was originally a suit of granting a license to the Bgrv. A. Maguire. Clerk, lLA., to the donative or perpetual curacy of St. James's Clerkenwell. The rev. gentleman having been elected incumbent of the parish by the vestry constituted under the 18th and 19th of Victoria, chap. .20, and the 19th and 20thof Victoria, chap. 112, a caveat was entered in this court against the license, and proceedings were subsequently instituted in Chancery. The Lords Jus. tices of Appeal decided that the election was vested in the prishioners at large, and by them Mr. Maguire has since been chosen ineumbent. Dr. JizxPx now moved the Court on behalf of Messrs. Dudley and Carter to dismiss the suit with costs. Dr. BAYFORD appeared for Mr. Maguire, but The learned JUDGE, without hearing him, said he could not condemn Mr. Maguire in the costs, not having heard the case. A new caveat has been entered against the last election, and the opponents were directed to deliver in an act on petition next Court day. PRAMCK V. vxkR.tn This is a suit instituted by Mrs. Pearce against her husband for restitution of eonjugal rights. (On the day prior to the return of the citation, Mr. Pearoee, who appeared. in person, alleged that notice had been given to aMr. Wills, the proctor for Mrs. Pearce, by his wife, not to proceed further in the suit, notnithstanding which he had returned the citation, and now presented a bill for taxation, amounting to 261. Os. 10d. The notice was accompanied by a note from bMr. Pearce, stating that he would call upon him on the following day or on the succeeding Saturday. Mr. WiUs alleged that he waited in court the whole of the foUowinday, and that Mr. Pearce not appearing, he deemed it righ0 on behalf of his client to return the citation. He subsequently saw Mrs. Pearce, who approved what he had done, her husband not having carried out an arrangement into which he had entered. Dr. Spinks appeared for l7. Wills. The learned JNUDGE considered that a discretion was vested in Mr. Wills, and that he had properly exercisc1 it; a monition therefore must issue, ca3ling on Mr. Pearce to pay the costs. Mr. Pearce requested time to comply with it, to 'which Mr. Wills assented. The learned JUDGE said that Mr. Wils had acted very creditably.

POLICE. 3IANSION-HOIUSE.-hMr. John Graham, of Brook's-wharf, and GcorgeWiug,a lighterman,again attended in answer to a summons which charged them with haviog permitted 20 tons of shee{'s hoofs in a putrid;condition to remain in a barge in the 1ames for several days, to the great annoyance of the public. From the evidence adduced at the former hearing of the case it appeared that towards the end of last month some of the inhabitants of Queenhithe drew the attention of Mr. Alderman Roce (tho alderman of the ward) to a most in, tolerable stench that proceeded from a barge then lyingclose to Brook's-wharf, eontaining a cargo of sheep's hoofs in a state of putrefaction; and upon inquiry it was a&-ertained that the first-named defendant was the wharfinger who shipped therm into the barge, of which Wmg was lighteionan. Upon the intervention of the city anIhorities the barge was removed from Brook's-wharf to a buoy adjacent to Southwark-bridge, and thence to Pickle Berring-wharf and several other spots below bridge, the cargo being eventually deposited in some premises at Blackwall. It also appeared that both defendantts upon finding that the cargo had become heated, and was giving off a most foul stench, did all in their power to procure a vessel to take it to its destination in Scotland, but without succes, each master of a ship they applied to objecting to the freight on account of its putrid condition. Mr. Stuehbury, from the office of the City Solicitor, appeared in support of the prosecution, and Mr. Huddleston attended on the part of the defendants. Mr. Stuchbury.-This case was adjourned tilU to-day for the purpose of affordimg the defendants an opportunity of consulting with their legal advisers. I have gone through the depositions taken at the last examination, and I do not consider it at all desirable or neceesarytoadduce any fusther evidence on behalf of the prosecution. The case is so clear that I shall leave it in your Lordship's hands, to be dealt with as you may think proper. Mr. Huddleston.-I appear for the defendants, and I think your Lordship will say, when the whole of the circumstances are before you, that the justice of the case will have been answered 'oy the inquiry that has been already instituted. No doubt, every person who is desirous for the preservation of the health of the city must feel that this is a proceeding which is very properly instituted, and must be most anxious that everything in the shape of a nuisance, or which is calculated to injure the health of the metropolis, should be speedily put an end to; but I think, when you hear the circumstances under which Mr. Graham was put in oossession of these hoofs, you will be of opinion that he was really in a most unfortunate position, and one which he did not at all bring upon himself. Towards the end of last mouth Mr. Graham, being a wharfinger, and having veosels for the purpose of conveying articles from the wharf to different ships, was employed by a MIr. Alexander to put a quantity of hoofs on board a vessel,which was to take them to Scotland. At the time tbe hoofs were put into Mr. Graham's barge they were perfectly sweet, and it was pro posed that on the 28th ult. they should he shipped on board a veosel called the Excelsior, then bound for Scotland. That vessel, through some derangement of its machinery, was not able to take them, and upon their being brought back to Brook's-wharf the exposure to the air had caused the animal matter upon them to heat and fermentk producing therebyundoubtedly a most disagreeable and nau. seous smell. . Graham, immediately he perceived what had occurred, sent to Mr. Alexander, the gentleman -who had instrueted him to ship the hoofs, apprising him of their condition, and begging of him to remove them im- imediately. Upon thls lr, Alexauder went into the nLarke aridappJ.edto nu.eroua broker3, offering theinavej 'ak Eelentsge i5 they would procure a me:oa of transit- {org nDf, Not b3ibq able to su-eed, be app'ied to hfr. Gra. bsmn to rhift them from one barge to another, hoping that by allowng tha airlope rneat3 through them the stell would Es '-stroyed. Tshe n -istesa of other vP-gels then re-' fusEd to take therm. Mr. Graham cot'ld not throw them into the Thamrs, otherwhe he wonld have been liable to a penalty of 20L rnaer the 6th and 7th of Victoria, chap. 56, sec. 26. Thus, 'Mr. Graham was unable to get rid of this unfortanate cargo before a complaint was made re. 4 specting the nuiusance itcre td to the public. Under thesoI eircumstances, I hope yourLordsbip will think that the ends of justice wiU be answered withott sending the matter for further 'nvestigation. Mr. Stuobbursy. - The statement just made by Mr. HIndaleston was borne out by the officers at the former hearing of this case. The Loan4 M&Yo.-Yes, the City Solicitor stated on the former occasion that Mr. Graham had rendered every possible asistance with a view to fctrther the ends of justice, but what I felt most strongly and complained of was, that the nuisnoe had been remored fronm place to place, and until I happened to perceive the intolerable stench the cargo was not removed from the river. The harge was removed On the day following that uponl which I complained of the nuisance. Therefore there does not seem to have been sO much didficulty in getting rid Mr. auddleston.-About the 6th or 7th inst. the hoofs wire removed to Se. Biide's-wharf, and by that time the smell had ceased. The LORD AYoR.-ome extraordinary process mnst have been resorted to to get rid of the stench in so short a time. I think that the authorities of Wapping instead of allowing the cargo to be landed there, ought to have sent it to the Nore, and had it there thrown overnoard. I cannot help thlnking that to a certain extent Mr. Graham has not been the offending party, but that he has been made a dupe. I think also that some blame attaches to the ihtezrman for having taken the barge from plae to ulace, Under all the circumstances I shall dismiss the complaint, and I'trust that the publicity which will doubtless be given to these proeecdmsn will prevent the recurrenc of a nuisance of this description. I have no doubt that this decision will give satisfaction to Mr. Alderman Rose and the other inhabitants of the ward who thought it their duty to attend and prefer the complaint. Mr. Alderman Rosa said, he perfectly agreed with the decision at which the Lord Mayor had arrived. The IaRD M.sYOR (to the Waterbailift)-Whenever you find a nuisance of this description you need not be under any apprehension that you have no ,power to put a stop to es tome I will endeavour to find some power to reach the nuissane, and I shlla instruct you, as one of myr oficers, to take immediate measures against the persons creating it, GULDHALL.-Masia Burling, aged 54, of middle height, rather corpulent, fair complexIon, and bloated countenance, wvho described herself as a fortune-teller, was charged witlh having sent letters containing threats of a most atrocious character to Messrs Welch and Margetson, of Chea'sido Messrs. George fitchcock and Co., of St. Paul's Churchyard, and other gentlemen of the highest respectability and influenoe in the city. Mr. Martin, the chief clerk-Have you any additional evidence against the prisoner I Bull, the detective officer.-No, Sir; but, if it meets with the magistrate's approval, I should like to have the prisoner bound over in her own recognizances to appear here this d elartin explained to the Alderman that the detective officers Thain and Bull had made inquiries since the last examination, and that they now had reason to believe the prisoner had no guilty knowledge of the letters found in her possession.

M&RSnIAIX complied with the application. lebeccal Rice Hamilton, a tespectably.dresscd woman about3years of age, and attired in deep mourning, was then placed in the dock, charged on suspicion with writing or being concerned with the writer of the letters in ques. Thomas Thompson said,-I am in the employ of Messrs. Welch and Margetson, of Cheapside. On the 24th of March last I found a letter in the letter-box addressed to Mr. Thomas Welch, and on the 1st of April I fonnd another letter -with the address printed on the envelope of Messrs. Welch and Margetson, 14, Cheapside. I gave both of those letters to the cashier. Mr.1 Thompson, sen., said,-I am a cashier in Messrs. Welch and Margetson's employ, and received the two letters produced rom my son, and forwarded them to Mr. Thomas Welch. We have not used any of the envelopes like that in which the letter of the 1st of A ril was received for several years. Those envelopes were used by MrZ. Thomas Welch, at Bridge-place, Sounhwark, for the purpose of communicating 'with our other warehouse, which was then at 134, Cheapside. Mr. Thomas Welch said,-Oar warehouse is now at.16 and 17, Cheapside. On the 24th of March and the 1st of April last I received the two letters produced. I know the prisoner, as having had work from our factory at Bridge-place. We employed her from the 'eginning of 1855 until hlarcb, 1856, and during the whole of that time, and after she left our employ I was in the habit of rc,eiving filthy, disgusting letters, in a simuilar handwriting to those produced. I destroyed them at first, but they came at last so frequently that I preserved them. While the pPsoner worked for us she brouniht me several letters. Drecisely similar, which she said had been sent to her at her residence. Mri. Martin.-Have you any of the letters she brought to you 1 Thaiu (the detective).-I have them all here, Sir. Mr. Martin.-Then, produce some of them. Mr. Welch-Some of the letters which the officer has in his possession were sent to persons holding responsible situations in our employ, inciting them to rob us. MIrs. Atkins, a mantlemaker, carrying on business at 22, Bartlett's-buildings, said,-I know the prisoner. She was lodging in a house in which I lived when I first saw her which was two years ago last March. She has assisted me for the purpose of learning the business. I have seen her write upon one or two oecasions, and I should therefore be able to recognize her writing again if I saw it. When I saw her write she was writing letters. The two letters produced are, to the best of my belief, in the prisoners handwititug. Prisoner.-irs. Atkins never saw me rzite. Mrs. Atkins said,-I have seen the Drisoner write, and I have aso seen her writing, which she has shown me, and I recognize the handwriting in the letter of the lt of April as that of the prisoner. Thain here applied for a remans, to enable him to make further inquiries and get at other parties concerned in this meet diaboical system, for which purpose he wished to postpone giving his ownevidence at present, as it might otherwise retard his efforts and defeat the ends of justice. The prisoner w as therefore remanded. Bow-sTRarr. -Mr. William Cloak-, who keeps an oystershop in the Strand, and has a beer-retailer's license, was summoned at the mstance of the Excise Commissioners upon two counts, the first charging him with having, on the 7th of January last, sold one gill of brandy; and the secondwith having upon the remises, on the 21st of January, half-a-pint of gin ana about alf-a-pint of orange wine. Mr. Dwelly prosecuted, and Mr. Sleigh was counsel for the defence. In respect to the first charge the evidence was, that at about 9 o'clock on the ni"ht of the 7th of January two Excise officers, named Wright and Moore, went together to the defendant's house. Wright went in, leaving Moore outside to wateh. Wright, after eating some oysters, asked to see a waiter who had served him on former occasions, and, on seeing him, ordered some brandy, giving him the money (6d.) be,orehand. The brandy was brought, he drank it, and then went out. Moore, who had been watching from the opposite side of the street, positively declaed that none of the defendant's servants had come oat, as if to purchase spirits at a publichouse. Both -witnesses underwent a severe cross-examination by Mfr. Sleigh, but adhered to the essential points of their story. Moore admitted that thele was a constant foot traffic on both sides of the way, and that several vehicles of different sorts passed while he was waiching. IIe maintained, however, that he could see any one entering or leaving the shop as well as if he were on that side of the road. On the second charge the evidence was, that on the 21st of January William Gutterige, an officer of Excise, visited the house, and found in a cupboard in one of the entered rooms a decantercontaining about half a pint of gin, and on a sideboardanother decanter, containing about hblt a pint of orange wine. Mrs. Cloak told him that the wine was left fromx what was taken by some children at a birthday party. The gin, she said, was the remains of some that had been got inathe night before, to give the servants a glass each after the shop was shut. Mr. ILkNny observed that it was unnecessary for Mr. Sleigh to reply on the first charge, as he did not think there was sufficient evidence of selling. Mr. Sleigh said that if he had been called uDon to defend that charge he should have proved that the waiter by whom the brandy was alleged to have been served (who had been pointed out by the witness Wright) was ill a t home and in bed at the time this was said to have occurred. In respect to the second charge, he contended that the Act was meant to apply to the having sphits or wine on the premises for the purposes of sale, and that it did not contemplate punishing a man for having them for domestic use otherwise, he might be fined for having wine on the table when he was taking his dinner, which would be absurd. The learned counsel called a Mrs. Weaver, cousin to defendant, and also the waiter pointed out by Wright, to prove that the wine and gin had been onlyused on the occasions s-tated by Mrs Cloak. They both swore that there was not so much gin in the decanter when taken away as there was now. The waiter also swore that he was at home, ill, on the 17th. Mr. Sleigh said it was very unfair to the defendant that the bottle should have been taken away by the officers without being sealed or its contents measured. Mr. DweUly contended that the strictest interpretation must bc put on the words of the Act. It was not necessary that the liquor should be "for purposes Of sale" in order to constitute the offence under this Act; nor did the statement made, even if true, afford an answer to the charge. Defendant had no right to keep wine or spirits for any purpose upon the entered premises. Mr. Harxv asked if Mr. Dwelly would go so far as to say that the landlord of such a house must not himself drink a glass of wine or spirits in his own house ? Mr. Dwelly would certainly go so far as to say that he must not do so in the entered rooms. He might take it in other rooms. Mr. Sleigh.-He must go to his bedroom. (A laugh.) Mr. Dweliy went on to say that, probably, if wine were only placed on the table for his own dinner the commissioners would not proceed. But, if that were so, it need not be left there afterwards. In this case the wine had been in the room for a month, according to the evidence for the defence. He maintained that defendant had no right to keep wine or spirits ie the entered rooms under any circumstances. Mr. HElNRY must read the Act again before he could ma.ke up his mind to interpret it so very btrictly. He must fsleeirne to consider his judgment. WOBnsMW-STR .-3rtha King, a r'snectably-draed ,iong woman, described as the dinghter o a tradesman at HIomerton, was ehargd upon suspicion of vilfully causing the death of her male infart.

Emily Mitchell, a young lady dressed in deep mourning, stated that the pnsoner, who wAs an intimate friend of hers, bad been in the frequent habit of visiting at the hovse of her father in Bridge-strcet, Hometton, and paid one of these visits on the evening of the 27th uit. She stayea tiU late, and, as she appeared to be ill, abe persuaded her to deep with her.

Prisoner remained in bed till 9 o'clock in the morning, when witness left home and did not return tiUl betweren 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when, upon gong up to her rooma, she found the door fastened. A short time after she met the prisoner on the stairs with something in her hand, and on finding her going towards the garden endeavoured to induce her not to do so. The prisoner, however, went, and on returning to the houve she w5a so shivering with cold that she was obliged to give her brandy to restore her. Witness sabsequently observed such indications in the bedroom as to induce alarm and sus- icion, and on the following day such a discovery was rade y the pollee from information they had reoeived as resulted in the piisoner's detantion upon this charge. Beck, a constable of the N division, deposed to being sent to the house of the last witness's father and that upon searching the wateroloset. which affordci proof of something seriously wrong, he discovered imbedded in the soQ the ead body of a male infant, which ho conveyed to the workhouse for examination Mr. Stone, a surgeon of Homerton, stated, that he sawthe infant shortly after it had been discovered in Mr. Mitchell's garden, and afterwards made a post miwrtem examination of it. It was a ftull-grown child, its lungs were thorouiihly inflated aud he should say it mnust have breathed * br., though e could not positively affirm that it had been born alive, yet he belleved it would have been so if proper assist. ance had been rendered. The prisoner, who had only with great difficulty hitherto supported herself, here became so hysterically affect^d, and then exhausted, tnat Mr. D'EYNcouvT ordered her to be conveyed home at once in a cab, and djourned the case for a fortnight, in the meantime accepting the bail of a gentleman attached to the City Mission, Who had much interested himself on the poisoner's bahalf, and who voluntarily ten. dered himself for the purpose.

O.," a post-offlce order for 20s., and"1 C. C.," lOs, SOWARL-In the course of the afternoon Edward Atlins, a rmiddle-aged mana, a plumber, was brought before Mr. COaBE for final examination, charged with attempting to murder Elizabeth Foreman, by cutting her throat with a razor. The complainant, the left side of whose throat was bandaged up. stated that she lived at No. 3, Union-street, Borough-road, and unti aix weeks ago she had cohabited with the prisoner as his wife, when they separated. The prisoner left some of his property at her house, and meeting him on Monday, the 6th inst., she told him to caL at her house the next morning and fetch the things away. He id he would, and on the 7th while she was in bed he entered her room and then sho t up, and he took a razor and shaved himself. After he rad done he toldher to fasten:the door, which she refused to do. He then asked her to come and sit by him on the sofa, and she declined doing that, but went and sat near the window looldng into the street. While there she felt the prisoner nushing something violently against her gide, which she at first thought to be his Iknuckles, but afserwards she perceived it to be a lnife, which she took from him and told him tokeep away for the future. He then seized her suddenly by the neck and forced her head on the bed, and then cut her throat and face with the razor he had shaved with. She struggled with him, and, hearing some one coming up to the room, he auitted it. Witness was immediately attended to by a octor, and for some time suffered severely. Mr. Francis Smith, a surgeon, carrying on business at 114, Blackfriars-road, said that on the morning of the 7th he was called to No. 3, Union-street, Borough-road. He 'went there and passed the prisoner in the passge of the house, and on entering the bedroom upstairs he saw the prosecutrix on the bed with a very severe incised wound about three inches in length extending from under the left ear towards the face. She was bleeding very profusely, and fainted from loss of blood. H"e immediately dressed the wound, and was satisfied that had it been buxt half an inch lower beneath the ear it would have caused almost immediate death. The razor produced might have indicted just such a wound. He could not saythat it was not a dangerous wound when he dressed :t. Lawrence Keefe, police-constable 474 A, said that about 11 o'clock on the morning of the 7th inst. he heard screams of "Murder" proceedfrom No. 3, Union-street, Boroughroad, and on entering the house he met the prisoner in the pmasage, and from information he received he stopped him; ongoing upstairs he saw the prosecutrix in her bedroom, with her throat cut in a dreadful manner. The last witness was there dressing the wound, and prosecutrix fainted from IOSB ot blood, but wvhen she tame to her senses she pointed the prisoner out as the person who had inflicted the wound, and he took him into custody. On searching the room he found two tableknivew one of which was much bent, and behind the looking-glass he saw the razor produced covered with blood.. Mr. Co=sg told the prisoner that was aU the evidence against him, and he should commit him for trial at the Central Cziminal Court. Did he wish to say anything in defence I If lie did, It would be taken down in writing, and might be used against him on his trial. The prisoner, who seemed much depressed in spirits, said he should reserve his defence until his triaL. MIr. ComS: accordingly committed him to Newgate in the usual way. LAmBTI.-Richard Pitts and Bernard Gregory, aZiwu Mayhew, ticket-of-leave men, with James Hands, al;-s Scotty, and Henry Brown, wellUknown thieves, were charged before Mr. ELLIOTT with burglariously breaking into the shop of Mr. Peterson, a tailor and draper in Rye-Lane, and stealing therefrom nearly a cart-load of fine woollen cloths, ready-made dlothes, and other property. tr. Solomon attended for the prisoners, and Mr. Lund, the superintendent of the police in the district, was present to watch the case. Mr. Peterson, the prosecutor, deposed that about 1 o'clock on that morning he retired to rest, and that some time after both himself aud his wife had been disturbed by noises, which they concluded had been occasioned by nightmnen employed in the neighbourhood, and therefore they took no further notice of them. On coming down at about 7 o'clock, however, he foundthat his shop had been broken into at the back and a great portion of his stock of cloth, &c., carziedaway. Thepropertyproduced, whichhad beenfound in an unoccupied house close to his residence, was his, and had been carried from his shop. A youth named George deposed to having seen the prisoners and a fifth man not in custody, at a quarter to 6 o'clock on that morning, go towards the house in which the properby had been subsequently found. The prisoner Pitts at that time was driving a Pony and cart. From the further evidence, whioh was given at some length, it appeared that the presence of the pony and cart in the neighbourhood had excited the suspicion of Sergeant Bond, and he in consequence had it stopped and taken to the station-house, with the prisoners Pitts and Hands, who were then in it. Soon after the prisoners Brown and Gregory (the third man having made his esoape) were stopped, the former by Constable Philip Alpress, 2S5, and the latter by Fitzgerald, 170 P, when a fierce and desperate struggle took place between the respective parties. Alpress, who is a powerful man, after a fierce encounter secured Brown, without sustaining serious injury, though his opponentvas armed witha foridable "rlife-preserver," hut poor Fitzg,erad was not so fortunate. Daring his struggle *ith Gre gory he got most brutally ilused, and was kicked so severely that he is in too dangerous a state to be able to attend. A waistcoat and a piece of cloth, found on the prisoner Brown at the station-house, were identified by the prosecutor, and Mr. Lund requested a remand. Mr. Solomon said he did not feel justified in resisting the request of m r. Lund, and the prisoners were remanded Sarah Goslin and Caroline Johnson were ne.xt placed at the bar on a charge of being concertned with the prisoners in the laent csci ste3hng a vast quantity of lead from five houses in Peckham a few days rago. Both the prisoners were sworn to by two or three witnesses as having been with the same pony anti cart as that taken from the other prisoners, and close to the place where the robbes y had been committed on the morning the lead was stolen. The prisoners were also remanded for a week.

COURT OF BAJ.J.VKRUpTCY, Basinghal-,street, April 22. IYN RE ROYAL BRITISH BANK. Mddore Afr. Corxmiwoner HOLROYD.1 This was a meeting for the further examination of the 'llon. Joha Stapleton, M.P., the depiatygovermor of the bank Mr. Linklater appeared for the assgnees; Mr. Huddlwsto and Mr. Freshfield appeared fo Mr. TStspleton. Mr. CQryton, depositor, made a application to the ¢ourt for an order that no ferther exemination of the di_ rcotors be instituted. It was not nposed that the inquiry could result in any criminal proceedings against members of the board. The proceedings wme attended with great 4expense, which must come out ef the pockets of the deposi. tors or shareholder. Enough 'ad been brongbt to light to satisfy public eosity, and to benefit could result from pursuing the iavestigation. There was no pretence that any assets had been concealed. He had further to ask that no ,costs might beoallowed in oespect to the expenses attendant upon the proposed compromise. The Co sMoeTox\tR Sad the examination of the directors was in accordance with the directions in the Act of Parlia. 'nent. Mr. ILaSLATER said that this was one of those melancholy cases in which it was found that, however much men inight work, and however hard and however much they '^night exert themselves for the benefit of others, doing so without remunoration and pay, as these assignees and committee of depositors were doing, working, as they had worked, at the sacrifice of great personal comfort for many months-it was one of those incidents in which, work as hard as men would, there were some ungrateful enough not to acknowledge it. Mr. Reed said that he had happened to come into court accidentally, and he thought it was only due to Mr. LiAnklater to say, as he had heard something imentioned about the costs of the compromise, that whatever Mr. Linklater had done with respect to that compromise he had done without any charge; it so happened that he 4Mr. Reed) had been made the depository of the fund whichhadbeen subscribed bya number of shareholders topay -the expenses whic'h Mr. Linklater might incurout of pocket, and he had from time to time given Mr. Linklater ohecks merely to pay the money which he had paid in advertiseiments, for the hire of the room at the Freemasons' Tavern, aud for stamps and such things. Such payments as these Mr. Linklater had been reimbursed, but he certainly must do Mr. Linldater the justice to say that not one shilling of charge had been made by him with respect to the compromise, and Mr. Linklater had from the first of those 0ots said that they could not be claimed from the estate; but he was so desirous ef carrying out the compromise and to get rid of the litigation existing between the shareholders and the depositors that so far as the costs of the compromise were concerned he did not make any demand for them. He, 3&. Reed, might perhaps be allowed to state again that ho was merely there by accident. Mr. LI,ArATER said that except for the fortuitous circumstance of his friend Mr. Reed's presence he should not have taken the trouble to answer any attack that had been made upon him. It was right that the creditors shouad know that the only object he had in view in attempting this compromise was their advantage; that he bad devoted days and nights to the subject withont cbarge and without pay, 2nd without the hope or prospect of reward. With reference to these proceedings, which some seemed to think were conducted by the solicitors and some to think were con. 'ducted by the assignees, it was right that he should at once aate that it was neither; bat that it was an inquiry directed by the Court, which the assignees were bound to carry out; that was all he had to say upon that subject. Mr. Paddison said that perhaps his Honour would allow hdm, before the evidence was gone into, to advert to one point in the evidence which was given on the last occasioni by Mr. Stapleton with reference to a certain meeting of the directors, which was proved by the attendance-book to have been a special meeting he]d on the 2.5th of December, but of which special meeting no minute appears in the minute. book of the directors. It might be expected that some explanation of that apparent mystery should be given by him. self. He had accordingly endeavoured to find whether he could give any such explanation, and he ascertained upon reference to his diary for the year 1855 that an explanatien by himself was utterly impossible, because from the 17th of Octobor to the 29th of October he was absent from London on the continent, and therefore he could not give any ex. planation whatever of the particular meeting referred to. Mr. Deputy Dakin was examined. His evidence, however, went merely to show that the only representations made to him by MIr. Stapleton were in respect to the posi. tion of the Wolsh Works. He did not state anything in respect to advances to Mr. Humphrey Brown or any other director or officer of the bank. The communication in respect to the Welsh Iron-works had certainly alarmed him, and he would not have joined the board after those repre. sentations, without instituting inquiry. On further examination by Mr. HUDDLMSTON,, Mr. Dakin said it was entirely on Mr. Alderman Kennedy's recommendation that he joined the bank. Notbing was told him of Mr.HuinpbreyBrown's debt, and he was perfectly astonished when he heard of the failure of the bank. He had not told Mr. Wilkinson that Mr. Stapleton had acted very candidly towards him; at least, he had no recollection of having so told him. Mr. Alderman Kennedy told him that the bank was doing a prosperous business, aud proinised to become one of the leading institutions of the the country (a laugh), and that his own brother-in-law had just joined the bank. Mr. Stapleton, examined by Mr. LiNKILATER, said:Before the lst of Febraary, 1856, I had become aware of Brown's, Tarte's, and Blacken's debts, and that on the Welch Works, in the aggregate upwards of 200,0001. Cannot say the precise period when I became aware of Oliver's debt. I anticipated a loss of some thousands by that debt wheni I discovered it. Oliver had failed before I joined the bank. From the minute of December, 1855, now shown me, I must ther have bcen aware that the bank had a claim on himn, but the amount is not specified. I cannot say whether 1 knew in January, 1850, what would be the amount of the loss. I will not swear I did not. To the best of my belief I did not know of M'.regor's debt till I became deputy governor in February. 1S5G, when I learnt it from the " green book," which Mr. Esdaile putinto my bands. From an ent. y on tbe 2d of January, in reference to l'CGregor's shares in the Irish Peat Company, it must then have come before me that he was a debtor to the bank, but not the amount. An acknowledgment of his debt of 7,3001. odd, in 1854, never came before me. I did not join the bank tiU a year and a half after. Another entry, of the 8th of January, 1856, refers to the Peat Company's shares; but I do not think that these entries led me to make any inquiry. I had become aware before August, 1850, that M'Gregor was indebted to the bank upwards of 7,0001., and that the security was inadequate. There was a life policy for 1,G001., and also his qualfication shares in the Royal British Bank. I was then aware that the bank would lose some thousands of pounds by him. I don't know when I became aware that Mr. Mulins had died largely indebted to the bauk. I doa't remember any comiRittee to investigate that debt. Some time or other the debt came to my kiowledge, but it is impossible to state when. I don't recollect giving Mr. Paddison instructions in November, 18K5, for taking in a claim in chancery. It might have been in Decemuber, 1835,orJanuary, 1856, that I?first knew of Mr. fullins's debt, but what it was I don't know even now. I knew that there would be a loss of some thousands to the bank. Probably about the tame time I knew that Mr. Cochran was indebted to the bank several thousand pounds. I bad no personal intercourse wvith him beyond being on the samiie finance committee. Idaresay I knew of these debtsbefore February, 1850. I was not on terms of intimacy with any of the directors or officers of the bank. Referring to the green ledger, I find that Cocbran's debt on the 4th of FehmUary, 1856, was 8,6261. At the close of the bank, on tho 30th of August, he owed 10,3Til. according to the book. Mr. LIN ALATER.-See if the account was not increased very nearly 1,0001. from the 5th of August to within one month of the closing of the bank. Mr. Stapleton.-It appears so. (Sensation.) But I did not allow him thus to increase it, and I cannot understand who did. Examination continued.-The account was contracted before my timie. I did not watch its progress by looking at the green ledger. My inpression was that Cochran was doing what he could to diminish his debt. In August, 1855, it WaS nearly 12,0001., so there has been a dimiinution. I wa\s aware that Cochran had had a cash credit at one time of .ri,001. At the top of folio 207 of his account " 5,0001." is written, hut it does not appear what that has reference to. ITV s. .....;16.. ...... .. would not bave oocureA to me th.at th-a-t w-as th'e l-imnit o-f the cash credit. I should rather have thought it vras a balance at first sight. The same figures appear at the head of folio 204. hut I did not pay partictlar attention to Cochran's account. I knew that considerable loss was apprehendedl by it. I merely cast mny eye ovEr the leaves and saw the items. I don't recollect hearing that Cochran's sureties had failed in February, 1855. I heard that there was a loss on some bonds of a party in Liverpool, which he had handed to the bauk. Cochran's account was never beforethecomnmnitteeon conlvertible secuirities. The hank also held his shares as security. Probably I first became aware of Gswyniue's deht when I g"t access to this book. His account is at page 220; at the head is written, "Limit, 3.000." At the head of Cochbran's account the word "l:mit" does not appear. I did not investigate the account sc as t-, know what the " 50001." meant. I certainly should not know, on first seeing them, what they .neant. Not being accustonied to bankijg. I miiight have thonght at first sigl.t that it was a balance brought over. I bad nothing to do with banking till I joinmedi this bank. Ar. LLNKLATrR.-Then I am misiniformned. Was not your father a banker? Mr. Stapleton.- My father was a hanker. Mr. LYNISXLATER.-Were yoa not in your early days in your father's establishment ? Mr. StApleton.-Never. Mr. LTaN.K ErP-Never? Mr. Stapleton.-Never. I do no' thinl I ever set foot behind the counter. Examination oe3tinned.-Tha debt to (rTynne in the | green ledger, at the t,nd of 1865. is 7 477 S. I saw that alaance w.uen I because 6pruty governor, in February, 1856.

These willruup by payments on the securities, interest, Mr. LINIlATEF-And if the party is a director, I supPose it Wil run up in other ways ? (A lo&ugh.) Mr. Stapleton.-An item of 1,7921. is charged in Decemn. ber, 1855, as irnteret on past due bills. As far as I can recolleot, I never knew that Owynne was indebted, besides this balance, on a number of past due bills to the amount of 5,0001. I now know that his debt is upwards of 11,0001.,at least, ! hear it. Mr. LU&KLATEu.-3ave you tot heard it before to-day? Mr. Stapleton.-Of course, I heard Mr. Coleman's state. ment. In Augst 1856, I knew that Mr. Gwynne's debt was doubtful, bitt he had hopes of being able to pay part of it. I recolleet Dent's bankruptcy. He was a debtor to the bank, as surety for Tarte. I must have known of the Islington cattle-market debt before August, 1856. It was contracted long before I joined the bank. The debt was 9,0001. or 10,0001. It was looked upon as hopeless, but something was to be got from De Tape and Harrison. It was a transaction which I should never have enaged in. I regarded it as an unfortunate affair. Harrison is able to pay, but he is out of the jurisdiction, at Boulogne. At the beard meeting on the 30th January, 1856, the report and balanoe-sheet to be presented at the approaching haif-yearly meeting was discused. The provision for bad debts was made each half-year by Mr. Cameron. It was stated the other day to have beex 3931. in February, 1856. I did not consider thaSt a sufficient provision for bad debts. It is extremely likely I said so, but I eannot state positively. I then knew of Brown's, Tarte's, the Welsh Work, Blacken's, Oliver's, M'Gregor's, and other debts; but I could'not then say whether the moment had arrived for writing those off as bad debts. Mr. LUTKLAMR.-Did you or did you not believe, on the 1st of February, 1856, that a fair and honest provisionfor bad debts would have amounted to severalthousands of pounds? Mr. Stapleton.-I cannot give you any other answer. The CoiLussio.ER.-You say you did not think the sum wvritten off sufficient; how much do you think ought to bave been written off? Mitr. Stapleton.-I don't think I formed any concludion as to the amount. I kQnew that if the bank had then been thrown into bankruptcy there wsould have been a deficiency; but I supposed that by going on the liabilities might be reduced. I thought the provision made was not The C0OMUSSIONER.-Was it a fair and honest provision ? Mr. Stapleton.-I do not think it was sufficient, but everything depends on the mode of writing off bad debts. It is entirely a question of time. A banker does not write off a debt immediately he supposes it to be bad. The C0oiMLcssroh' ..-Taldng the most sanguine view posible, could you have covered your bad debts with Mr. Stapleton.-No; I don't think we could. The CoMMLIsIONER.-Then, was it fair and honest to tell the shareholders that you could? Mr. Stapleton.-We did not tell them we could. That is the reason the words were altered. We called it a provision, but not a sufficient provision. I won't say it was a fair and honest provision. I don't believe that it was a dishonest provision, or that we were deceiving the shareholders. Many of them knew that the hank was in a critical positon, and had incurred large losses. I will not answer whether I believed that this was a fair and honest provision. On the 1st of February, 1856, I had no exact idea of the actual losses of the bank. I did not know that they had exceeded 25,0001. Explain what you mean by actual losses. Mr. INTL_.rxTm-? will not. Answer as an honest man. ( Hear, hear," and anplause.) M. HUDDLZSTON obiected to the question being put in that form. Mr. LrN.LATEn sad he had reason to insist upon an answer. Mr. IuODLDSTON said as long as Mr. Linklater confined himself to the questionshe did no; interfere, but when Mr. Linklater made an observation accompanying a question, he felt that he must interfere, and Le must ask his Honour to protect Mr. Stapleton from this observation. Mr. Stapleton would have no objection to answer any question that might be put, but no observation ought to accompany it. The CoMhssioxi;R said the question was whether Mr. Stapleton did not believe that the bank had lost upwards of 20,0001. Mr. HUDDL-STON said he did not object to that ; but there was an observation made-" I ask you as an honest man"--that was what he objected to. Mr. LINKLATER said he had had the pleasure of hearing the learned counsel before, and he might ray that it was a lesson he bad taken out of his own book. Mr. HUDDLESTON said if Mr. Linklater would take a lesson out of his book he would withdraw the cause of his objection. Examination continued.-The money was lent out in a mine that might realize something. If you mean there was no legal remedy, and no means of suing for it, he reaUy did not know that the bank had lost 25,0001. We were, perhaps, not very likely to recover. He did not exnect it. He could not say whether anybody else on the direction expected to recover it. These items certainly were assets of the bank; but he did not believe that any sharebolder in the room, or any person, would believe that those assets would realize 20s. in the pound. The shareholders must have known that among the conivertible securities there were a good mvany of a doubtful character, concerning wbich the directors might have still entertained a hope; some of their hopes might be realized and some not. The information contained in that item of 390,0001 did not convey more or less information than the words and figures. He had no belief upon the subject whether Mr. Oliver's debt was included in the item of 892,0001 . He did not know where it would appear if it did not appear there. He had no doubt now that Mr. MIullins's debt was included in that item; but he did not know at the time what provision had been made. He had no belief upon the subject whether that item included hlr. Oliver's debt. Ho believed it inoluded Mr. Humphrey Brown's debt of 70,0001. He expected a loss, but the other directors did not. He did not know of the existence of Mr. M'Gregor's debt at that time. He believed that it included a great many past due bills. Perhaps it included all. He was present at the annual meeting at which the report and accounts were read in February, 1856. He heard the report read by the general manager, Mr. Cameron. He was, no doubt, apprehensive that a considerable portion of the paid-up capital had been lost. He found by looking to the past die billbook that the past due biDls at the end of January, 1856, exceeded 64,0001. He did not recoUect any considerable discussion taking place at the general meeting of the 1st of February, 1856, with reference to the shares being issued at a premium. He supposed that the 61. per coent. dividend was an inducement for the shareholders to take shares. Hfe did not recollect the chairman of the meeting saying their object was to give the fullest informstion to their proprietors, but he supposed he did, Be recollected Mr. Owen passing a high eulogium upon Mr. Esdaile, the governor. He did not recollect that the shareholders gave him a vote of thanks. He remembered Mr. Alderman Kennedy saying something. He could not recollect whether Mr. Alderman Kennedy referred to the profits which the bank had made. The usual 2,0001. a-year was voted to the directors at that meeting, and they got it. (A lugh.) He recollected hlr. Cameron coming in for his sliare of the thanks. (Laughter.) He was appointed deputy-governor the Tuesday after the 5th of February by the directors. He had discovered the state of Mr. Humphnrey Brown's account before the 1st of February, 15G. Ee did not voluntarily abstain from registering the mortgages to the hank of Mr. Humphrey Brown's Glocester ships. He spoke to Mr. Cameron, and Mr. Cameron pronjised to get t em registered, but individually a single director had no powertogivedirections. He sawMr. Humphrey Brownseveral times at the bank. There were one or two bills discounted afterwards for which he gave security-a mill at Tewkesbury -many hills might have been disenunted without his consentor knowledge. He did not recollect saying a the meeting of the 20th of September that lie had found out that Ar. Humphrey Brown was a debtor after he became deputygovernor. If he said he did not know anything about Humphrey Brown'sdebts at that time it certainly was a mistake-it was not a wilful untruth. He should not have ben a party to discounting bills unless there were some special circumstances in it. He was a member of the committee which authoxized the discounting of Mr. Huimphrey Brown's bill on the 14th of February, iS56. He-was not surprised at it. Ife might have looked to Mr. Humphrey Brown's discount account from time to time. He did notg recollect seeing the bills were entered. The green ledgerowas not poited up every day. It was hept by Mr. Cameron's private secretary. He would not swear that he was not a party to discounting aknother bill for Mr. Humnphrey Brown-thlere were two or three discounted. Hlow could he have aniy doubt of the solvenc of Mr. Hunmphrey Brown, c-onsidering the position which he held ? He did not give any intication to the solicitor of the ank ntilafte themont of pril, 18.56, that Mr. H. Bowns mrtgges f hs sipsought to be registere, lI spoe toMr. amern. ery soon after he be-_ camedepty-gveror e deermnedto drive Mr. Camern fro his eat. e hadno cofidence in him. cause t wasthe gneralman~esbu soliandthe soli h- lcause It was the general manager's biisiness, and the soli. citor could do nothing without the orders of the general manager. Ho was being asked as to his actions as an individuaL He spoke to Mr. Cameron because Air. Cameron had influence there. IHe did not know that lie suggested at any Court meeting the propriety of the solicitor being instructed to go and register Mr. Brown's mortgages. He spoke to all the directors about them, and alluded to the propriety of their so doing. It was not brougbt before them at any meeting. He heard dlr. Paddison say, when they were drawing up a memorandum to be used in the Vice-Chancellor's C.urt. that Mr. Brown bad sail he would absent himself from the bank, and he told Nr. Camerot, he would absent himself frons the bank as long as he (Mr. Stapleton) attended there, and therefore there could be no doubt whatever that lie did cause Mr. Brown to absent hirnself from the bank, itzid he havinigabsented hinself fronu the bam-k he took the advantage to move that his seat be vacited. He did not go on discounting Mr. Taste's bills, whEen he heard that they amounted to 40,0001., after January, 1556. There were renewals. Hle did not know tbht Air. Tarte got any more money. It is possible that someof Mr. H. Brown's may bave been renewals. These items swellld the account, but they did not swell the assets. (A lau-h.) It n,ishb have buen the fact th'.t the bills discounted by the bank for Mr. Tarte would appear as accounts of the banik, but that was iot the motive for doing it. Ir. Cam,erois's debt was believed to hc good til late period. He could not say that be believed that the loses of the bank ,.mounted to .50,0001., but no doubt it would be a very consi.erable sumo. Perhaps if the assets of the bank had been realiz!d, unter the most favourable circamstances the.re might have beea a loEs of not mush le-s than 60,00 it. It gave bins a great deal of uneasiness. It was not dinsinished by the 10th of June. Mr. LiN1CLATER.-Had you not serious apprelhen-ions as to the safety of the bank before the end of June, 1456 ? Mr. Staploon.-Yes.

Mr. LINxAtThlR.-Do youi remember this also on the 12thi of July, which seems to sum up all the rest : "That a majority of these directors were 'adventurera' to whom most illegitimate seeoommodatIon was allowed, and that one of them we know was convicted in France for swindling, and sentenced to the galleys (exclamations from various parts of the court) ; that two gentlemen wrho wvere nominated to office did take their seats in. the direction, hut resigned in about a fortnight altar, as soon as they became acquaminted with the position of the company;, that the names of gentlemien were proclaimed at the company's meetings as having Joined the direction whose consent had never previowsly been asked. and that gusuhqruently, when applied to to join, thety unhesitatingly refused ; that the direction at the present molisent pre-ents the worst features of a 'close-borough' disection-for example. a really poor banister lend a late reportissuing fromA the inns of court showe us that a barber may become a barrister) is one of the number who stands In the relati nehip of eon-is-law to the chief of the executive-a fnact unPrecedented in joint stock hank directions;, that a roIsoynt was given In paymeunt lor those shares, which qual bedmim fory the direction-a fact we should holpe unprecedented iEn the amassing of Joint-stock capital ; that the capital ha% reached the vanishing point by reason of loesee and the recklceasimode of busne6se; that they have e asaesota a large mining property in South Wales, for which they have no title, and which lacy coannot,work. on account of the heavy lose It would weekly eutallupon them (of this * milistone' the company canuot gel rid because o f their inability to supply a titlls); that the oblIgations 5 ror. the chief of the executive, amnounting to tinas of thousbanes, are t' ail intents and purpr.ees. a bad debt, for the simple reason that the indtvidual has it no t in his power to Pay as many pence ; ihat. among much other worthless secturity, the company are large holders of the b,urds of i% lately decrased improvement rosi. pany, antd that all these worthless assets are put dowoasa good in the aerounts pub ished, to matie thinigs look plemasat to the shareholders; th.t au Iwmporiant legal officer of the company found it convenlent some times ag., to become dece%ssd, bec,iuso that at the timeu he f-estea itot t.orte etto nxut Z£5,60O * that the fact of his finding it convenient to beermo deceased wYe kNown to the chief of the execa ive and btudo.,vly suppresaid by him ; f irtherm re, that the 'd-functi'ent1eman is sAid now k, be rving in Belginm ' never better sabig lfe ; tvalt the coutrvn.y -),- coUtinually Cbs purchasers of their own shareR, aid that they Etrive by every means to pr7eent their beiug offered in the 114Ual Way." I suppose you recollect that, from the peculiarity of its Mr. Stapleton.-I do not think I could have read that, as there is oto particular thing that I should have recollected, and that is about a late report issuing from the inns of court, showing tbat a barber inight become a barrister; if that had reference to Mr. AM'Leod, lie was a gentleman. I have no recollection of that circumstance, and therefore it is very probable I never did read it. Examsination continued- His attention was called to these paragraphs before the 30th of Jane. He did not recollect whether Mr. Boviil was instrueted to give an opinion upon the question whether they should or not procsed againstthe Joint-Stock Jouiw-,al. It was very possible. Mr. Paddisuo stod it was, but he did not recollect it. There was sonre talk about proceedings, but he was against proceedings. He recollected the Joint-Stoc- Joet-uzu being referred to in his interviewv with Zsr. Gilltt and others. The Joint-S!ocd- Jour7rust was referred to at the subsequent half-yearly ineeting of the lit of August. Mr. LLxuLATElc.-Having your memory refreshed by. these facts, do you recollect that you hnd determined upon t4kipg the opinion of Mr. Bovill upon the sauhjet ?

Mr. Stapleton.Becanse there were a good many of thoee things which, no doubt, - Mr. LINILLTM-Were known to be untrue? Yr. Stapleton,-& good deal of evidence might come out which might be damaging to the bank and all interested in it whether depositors or others. Mr. LNKLr.&vx.-Why were not thc shareholders told so on the 1st o£ August? Mr. Stapleton.-Alow me to say that on the 1st of August those numbers of the 7oint-Slock- ,Tournal had been extensively distributed among the shareholdera, and if the shareholders had thought proper that this statement should be made they had the clue in their hands-they could have caLled upon me, but they did not. Some of the meost respectable shareholuers said it was not worth mentioning; they were as anxious as we were that it should not be brought forward, bfcause at that time we were endeavourIzg to transfer the business to some other bank, and they knew as wells awe that if such statemenWs were made the last hope was destroyed. If I had made a statement then it would haye been contrary to the wishes of the penons present. Mfr. IL -By . Let me ask you did not a shareholder at the meeting of the 1st of August ask whether the statements in the Joint-Stodc Journal were tzueor false? Mr. Stapleton.-Ido not know. Mr. IN]LATzR.-Try and recollect? Mr. Stapleton.-I do not recoUect that anything was said. Mr. LLI;RmE..-You can recollect whether any question of that kind was put to the Court of Directors present at that meeting? fr. Stapleton.-I do not recollect any question being put to Mr. Eadaile. I believe that this Joint.Stock Joursat was widely circulated among the shareholdera There were Mr. 3fitchell, ir. Gillott, and others. Mr. LINZLBT.-Did not Mr. lEsdaile say in your presenoe on the 1st of August, "that there was no trnth in the articles of the Joint-Stock Journal, and it it had not been for the increasing business of the bank the Court I Would have taken measures against the Joint.Sock Jour7al of a very trenchant kind?" Do you remember that ex*preselon? -ar. Stapleton.-I do not, Mr. LUTR DATEP-Did he not say, if such had been the case, the directors would have taken the most trenchan1 measures against the foulest conspiracy that was ever pul forward against publc institutions? 3fr. Stapleon.-I recollect the thing being mentioned. One of the shareholders said the thing was not worth allud. ing to, or something of that sort. Mr. LtlcKnAvxn.- Was not the tendency of Mr. Esdaile's iobservation to deny the trth of the charges in the Toint2fork Jotornal?a Mr. Stapleton.-I have no doubt it was to deny a portion of them. 1 believe a portion of them was untrue; not the whole. I do not believe that the shareholders were led to believe that none of the observations of the Jorbin-SWf ,Toumncal were true. Mholder. LKLAT.-Do you remember Mr. Harris, a share. Mr. Stapleton.-No, I do not. Mr. IA' LTATER.-Do you remember this letter from Mr. Harris to Mr. R. H.

I do not knowv Mr. Esdaile's handwiriting. 3fr. LINiLAmB.-Just see if you recollect that this is a note prepared for Mr. Harris:- Sir,-X am instructed by Mr. Eadatle. as a matter of personal courtes to Yourself. to reply to your commnuication of the 15th.

Mr. Stapleton.-Yes. Mr. LINKLATER.-Did you suppose from that that Mr. Harris would believe that the articles were true ? hr. Stapleton.-No. They were not true in all parts. Mr. LA2KLATER,-Did you believe he thoughtany portion of them true, and that they would affect the character of any of the directors of the bank ? Mr. Stapleton.-I do not know that he would. Mr. IsN KL.rxTtR.-Did he not write this letter in answer on the 19th of May, as addressed to Mr. Paddison ?- No answer. The letters set forth that Mr. Harris was extremely unwilling to believe in the charge against the bank, from the name of the general manager having become quite familiar Whim while residing for some years in the north of Scotland, where he was held in the highest respect and esteem. Now, having regard to the correspondence between the Court of Directors and Mr. Harris, have you any doubt whatever that Mr. Hlarris was induced to believe that there was no trnth in the charge against tho bank ? Mr. Stapleton.-I believe Mr. Harris got rid of his shares because his m ind was not satisffied. Examination continued.-Mr. Stapleton here stated the securities that the bank held of Mr. Cameron, that they amounted to about 12,0001. and a few life policies of little or no value, and the Royal British Bank shares. One of these sureties, Mr. Finlayson, was not, he believed, a she herd of Mr. Cameron's. Wr. LINKLATER.-Mr. Cameron's debt was 30,0001. Was it or was it not represented to the shareholders at the meeting of the 1st of August, 1856, at which you were present, that the bank w.s covered as far as Mr. Cameron's debt was concerned? Mr. Stapleton.-Mr. Esdaile made a statement at that meating which I have already said I disapproved of, and I told him so. Ee insisted it was right. le placed a higher value upon those things than I did. Mr. LLNEL&TEF.-Did you tell any one of the shareholders at that meeting that Mr. Esdaile was making an incorrect statement ? Mr. Stapleton.-No; because the shareholders were in possession of sufficient information to make them doubt ir. Esdaile's representation; and if they had chosen to caU for more information they might have had it. Examination continued. -Mr. Esdaile did make a statement to the effect that the bank was fuUy covered against Cameron's debt, but he thought he had gone too far in his gtatement. It was very likely that one of the shareholders spoke of the impropriety of advances baing made to those who were in the management. He believed what Mr. Esdailo stated was untrue, but he did not believe it was a voluntary untruth. He thought he was misrepresenting the value of Cameron's property. MIr. LIN LATER.-And, hearing this misepresentation, you made no comment whatever? !Mfr. Stapleton^-lN-o. I knew hfr. Esdailo was entitled to his opinion as much as I was to mine. I supposo Esdaile thought the bank was f.olly covered. He took a sangaine view of it, (A laulgh.) He could not say what he thought was M Erdale'sbelie. Howcoul he aswerthat-? ,ur. LiN-KL,OLTEB.-1 beg your pardon. Do you believe that Esdaile thought the securities wonld cover the amount? Mr. Stapleton.-I think Esdaile had very nearly persuaded himself of it. M Ir. Lr}KLATES.-YOU Wi not answer my question. Mr. Stapletou.-EIow can I answer asto another man's Mr. LLKTAL TERvYoU told us on a former occasion that you were determined to drive Cameron from his seat? 3Mr. Stapleton-Yes. I thought him very clever (laughter), but I did not think him a person to be trusted. Mr. LINsKUTER.-You say you never associated with him 1 Mr. S'apleton.-No, not out of doors. 1 spoke to him at the batk. I could not do otherwise. I met him before I joined the bank at Sir James Matheson's in Scotland, when he induced me to join. I never was associated with him. On one occasion when a publio scheme was on foot I spoke a few words to him, and that is all. Mr. LaNKLA. Lt-Don't you recollect in the month of June taking him in your brougham to the Reform Club to a baquget to be given to Sir W. Williams, of Kars? Mr. Stapletocs-I can explain that. That is not associating with a man. There was a performance at Drury-lane Theatre in July, towards the end of the session of Parliamient, of an ainatear pantomime. I was there with Cam(ron and I put him down at the Reform Club. (A LLNKLATM.-Le had given you a ticket of admission to the theatre 9 31r. Stapleton.-Yes; but I paid him for it. Mr. LumLATER-Bnt you went with him? Mr. S apleton.-I nmet him there. This was by appointmnent. He had offered me in the bank this ticket, for M hich I had to pay him. I set Cameron down at thebanquet, and went up the room to Sir William Williams, I do nO reeollect asking Cameron at the latter end of April to obtain a situation for a friend of mine.

I remember the expression about the scapegjoat, I think he used that expregsion in conversation. Mxfr. LENLATE.-DO you remember that he said if you made an attack upon him he would tur round upon the directors? Mr. Stapleton.-Not to me. Mr- LUIEATER.-What did yon hear about the scape- Mr. Stapleton.-It was not sd to me personally It was said at the luncheon table. It was with reference to the other directors. Mr. LlrNxLA- Now, having had Wamning after warning in the Joint-&ock Journal with reference to the falsehood, as alleged, in the accounts laid before theshareholdera, I ask you, did you take Any steps whatever to see of what the assets consisted that Were represented to the hare. holders in the balnce-sheet of August, 1856 ? Mr. Stapleton.-I took the most effectual step, and the only step that a man in my tlon could take. I Put the preparation of the bslance-set in the hands of the new general manager. The fnrst item in this new balanoce.heet repreEented the assets as being 810,2041. Os. 7d. I cannot sa whether that was a true account. If Crawford had had time he would probably have prepared a very different balance-sheet. I was on the past due bill oommittee. CzawSord very possibly told me that the assets of 810,0001 included past due bills to the amount of 42,0001., but they were considered a valuable property-worth 20s. in the pound. Mr. Stapleton was here examined touching his knowledge of the. past due bills book and other debts owing to the hank, and the manner in which each debt was described. 'rhe amounts varied from 201. to 20,0001. Against one debt to which Champion, Corser, and Robinson were the parties, there was written in his own hand, " Champion aead-Corser discharged-and nothing expected from Robinson." (A laugh.) Against another was written, "A U in the GazcUe, lot the bank debt be proved." Ie did not notice that Mr. Valliant bad vwritten " Bad" against one or more debts. AgainstMr. M'Leod's name there waswritten, "Debt hopeless-proesed against Smith immediately, who is gone aWay," (Laughter.) He Was aware that this was the mode of marking page after page, but he never looked at the book, and seldom had occasion to refer to it, He would not swear that he did not believe at this time thatone-fourth of the capital of the bank would not provo to be lost. On the 31st of January, 1866, he did not know that a single shilling was placed to the bad debt fund. A statement was ut forth to the public after this time in the document proneed that more than ordinary provision had been made for bad debts. Ho never addressed his mind, however, to that subject, and he had no belief uZen it. Would not undertake to say that Mr. Esdaile hd not in his presence staed that a sufficient provision had been made for bad debts, Something was said on the 10th of August about the hank closinz its doors. After a few more questions, Mr. INXLcaTER said he had ooncludedthe examination of Mr. Stapleton. Mr. Stapleton.-I wish to have an opportunity (f stating, after all this examination, that I only really became an active member of the board at the tLme already stated, and that during the 'whole time I was on it I never received any advantage whatever, except receiving a small fee as a director. I wish particularly to stste, as by some accident or other it was stated in some of the papers in my exanination a fortnight ago that I had signed a petition to the Board of Trade containing misstatements, I never 6igned a petition to the Board of Trade. The only document I signed was the certificate of the shares, and that certificate I firmly believed to be true MIr. Lrn-LATixR said he proposed to exAmine the auditors on a future day, and to examine Mfr. Humphry Brown (Mr. Brown was present in coert during the proceedings) on Wednesday next. Mr. Alderman Kennedy was abroad and suffering from ill health. He could not, therefore, be examined at present.
ROYAL BRITISH BANVK. TO THEE EDITORhOF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your impression of Saturdayv appears the result Of an interview stated to have taken place between a Mr. Frond and myself regarding the position of the batik. As faras Lmconeemed, I mu in the most unqalified terms assert that such statement is prfectly untrue,and when itisknownthatth o bank for an entire year neveramountecloO (h u mientioned by Mx. Frond) it will be obviou thtt asrinthat all the bad debts were to be tak-en out of a half-year's profits is entirely unwarrntable, and that neither the sums mn question nor the statement were ever made by me; nor did the convenbation assume the form that Mr. Frond is desirous of imparting to It, consisting rather in a narrtive of the success of his speculations and his talent in outwitting his stockbroker. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. THOMAS CRAUFURD.
KIDDEBRIINSTER RIOTS. TO THE EDITO1hOF THE TIBMES. Sir,-I expected that you, being the professed champion of justico, would ere this have made a few observations upon the fact of my name having been in your widelycirculated journal made most unpleasantly conspicuous in connexion with the Kiddernninster riots; and, as you havo also been pleased to make comments upon me before my defence, or even before the case for the yroseoution had closed, I do not ask the insertion of these few remarks as a favour, but, in justice to myself, demand it from you as a right. I am well aware that had the knowledge of the charge against me been confined to the people of Kiddermmister and the county in which I live I should have suffered no damage. Every one who knows me personally knows well that I am guite incapable of, and it Is impossible for me to be guilty of, the charge of riot, or wishing injury to any man; but my name is known in a commercial point of view, not only in several parts of Eneland, but in several parts of the world. No one deplores orregrets the disgraceful acts of tho infuriated mob, no one sympathizes more truly with the right hon. gentleman than I ao. But have I not reason to complain of the most infamnous attempt ever made to implicate a man of my standing in a criminal chargo for party and political objects ? Tho right hon. gentleman knows full well that I did not interfere in the election during the canvass; I was not present on the day of nomination, I did not hear a speech made, I did not ask for a vote, I was not in the town of Kidderminster for a week before the day of election, I did not come into the town till after 12 o'clock on the day of election; that I walked by myself to the booth to record my vote in favour of Mr. Boycott; that after the offer made by Mr. A. Talbot to protect the right hon. gentleman and his fricnds had been refused I wvalked away by myself from the booth. All this not only the right hon. gentleman knows, but all of his supporters know also. Surely, this being patent to every one, what could I have to do with the riot (as it is called) ? Why, this I had to do witL it,-I was talking in the road with three gentlemen, when we found ourselves in the midst of a shower of stones, my hat knocked off, the other three gentlemen also struck. We all ran across the road and scrambled over the hedge into a garden out of the way. Surely if I am a rioter the three gentlemen who were within a yard of me all the time (about three or four minutes) were rioters also. Was thare ever a more monstrous case of injustice and porsecution? Was there ever a more disgraceful prosecution instituted ? Having stated these facts, which have been proved in evidence, I leave the public to pronounce their verdict. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. lt. U1ikLL[NGWORTH. Park Attwood, April 21.
OBITtAPRY.-Died, on E ater Monday, that terrible old nuisanoe, Greenwich Fair; not a bit lamented by any one who knew it, pickpockets and gents aLlone perhaps excepted. The deceased bad been for many yeara in a bad way, and at the last had sunk to so low a state that it was evident its existence must be put a stop to. For mny seasons past the deceased had been subject to attacks by the public press, and from what had transpired in contemporary columns-those which are devoted to polic reports especially-it was evident that the decead could not long be expected to survive. It may be said. therefore, that tho death was chiefly brought on by exposure, while it will Fenerallybe admitted that it can but bo regarded as a appy release.

Two or three sessions xince this eompany went to Paria ment for poWers to make a railway from Fenchurchstreell to Wwfford and Loughton, mo sa to open up the hitsrt, una0commodated forest neighbourhood of Londoa, aW afford gret facilitles, not only for the stock, aipI, bill, and colonial brokers, who snu cong apte near thatieri xuB, to pan between their *es and home6, but lo fo reddents in the Eas-end to nake excursions into fresh air. and ae" the most wonderful sight within 10 miles of townmiles upon milea of open hornbeam thicket. The stength of the oompany's cme rested on tbsadmirble position of the Fenehurch-gteet terminus. The convenience of leaving the city from its oentre by tbis means brought in promis of snpport from every side aud enlisted the sympathies of the committee. On th faith of this the Bill pd, the line was made, and ir August last it opened, amid aodcmxtionc from city un forest. Mouldy mansions at Wanstead and Woodfor&. cytonatone and Loughton, wre furbished up, and aTidly taken by the brokers and others; house property along the line rose 20 per cent, in Value, and Clapham declined to dis. on the Stock-Exchange. From every ston oi the new rail, even through the ate autumn and wintrt months, season ticlcets Were taken up to an unexpecte( amount, and an extraordinary number of day pamengern went regularly up and down; so that this branch, with * prosperity unexampled in EAster Counties Railway annsal, actually paid more than had been clcurlated on, and win answerng commercully. Of coure, having to uee the sttions and rail of the Blackwall Company between Fm church-street and their own Stratford, they had to pe royalties to that company; but these were low-T believu only a guinea per season ticket, and a humble cpper ot so per single or day ticket, acording to the clas. Until the end of 1856 al lwet merry as a marriage bell; But with the new year came a change, consequent, it is believed, on the revolution which eliminated Waddingtom from the Eastern Counties Railway, and placed the helm really in the hnds of one Horatio Love, or heis muh malignea. This gentleman has the credit of the foUowing wise proceeding, besides that of shaving off the bear(s of the porters, &c., from Bishopegate to Lynn. Finding themselves unaooonntably popular with one section of the public, who were paying contentedly exorbi. tant prioss for the great eonvenience of a central city ter. mainus, the company resolved to work their one milch cow to the uttermost; and at one feU swoop removed half the trains-four ont of eight each way, daily-from Fenchurchstreet to Shoreditch, thus saving the royalties to the Blackwall Company. As a preliminary it was an. nounced that on a certain day the company, with patenal kindness, would change all the season-tickets for others of a much prettier oolour, and superior in every respect, with a neat little case to hold them, &c. But this exceSS of politeness alarmed the ticket-holders, and (inquiry having been made) soon a hint passed like wildfire down the line that the new tickets were to be available for Bishopegate only, not Fenchurch-street, and were clogged with condl. tions such as that the holder should never sue the compay in the probable event of a smash; that if one train was fua you should wait for the next, and not go home in a Hansom at the company's expense, and so on. Of course,therefore, the Machiavellian trick failed. If it had succeeded, I ahould like to have heard the opinion of a British jury on the point-not in Westminsbr Hall, but the Old Bailey. certainly before this 12 Englihmen have been found disposed to deal sricy with individual sinners obtaining propertj under pretenoes apparently lems false. The attempt, and not the deed, led to rebellion against not conquest by, the company; and the quarrel betweenz them and their customers is armighty pretty quarrel asit stands-C.g., by the latest move of the company if I takle a day-ticket to town I am obliged to elect between the termini. I may want to go to Fenchurch-street, and return by Bishopsgate, only, of course, by the advertised trains of the company running by the same rails to the same places; but my day-ticket to Fenchurch-street is not recog. nized at Bishopegate, and viac vrsd. Letexcursionistslook to themselves; if theytake ticketsfrom either terminus, they have not eight, but four trains only to choose betr-een fot their retn On returning unawares by the next up-train, theMmy be dragged from their carriage at sweet Stratford and be compelled to pay 6d. or 4d. extra, and, perhaps, wait half-an-hour, or an hour, at that pleasing place before they can return to the terminus whence they started. In my own case, I have to take a day-ticket to Fenchurch-street, but my time of leaving work compels me to return by a Bishops. gate train, and they make mae pay 6a. every evening to carrp me to Stratford, from which point their own ticket becomes available. It's like giving 2d. for an apple, and ild. mora to be allowed to eat it. Respectable Hebrews of Houndasditch ! if 4d. per head orn six or seven children be an object at the end of the excursion, go not to the woods; to thst extent you wil bet shorn on your return Alen of Mincing-lane! beware of seductive villas at Snaresbrook, and of snug boxes in the vicinity of the Epping Hunt. You miy travel to Fenchurch-street in the morning and be comfortably deposited within a stone's throw of the sale rooms; but yoe may have to return by distant Shoreditch, and expend the commission hardly earned on a small transaction in musco vado in a Hansm to the station and an extra ticket ta frank you to Stratford. Seriously, the inconvenience is one of importance, and 6d. a-day is too much to pay becaus the company dishonour their own pasteboard. Very likely they could be compelled to carry a day ticketholder back by any train on their tables, from whichever terminus it starts, but no one likes to play adventurous plaintiff against a pugnacious and desperate company. The most recent instrument of warfare adopted by the company is stiU more charcteristic; for, according to popu. lar belief, not only do they run the trains as slow and make the stations as Inconvenient as possible, but they assign to the poor devoted Woodford branch the more aged locomo. tivec Thus, on Saturday, the 1tth inst. (if the Board of Trade wish for particnlars on which to found an inquiry), the train leaving Fenchurch-street at 410 p.m was about Stepnoy brought to by being fired into by its own engine. The end of a horizontal cylinder was neatly blown oat of it in the manner of a steam gun, and raked the train. I believe the shot did not reach the smoking carriage at the end of the train, or disturb the stockbrokers there in their customary rnbber; but one carriage at least it perforated. passing unpleasantly near a human leg or two. And now we travel with the curious sensation of having a battery permanently planted sO as to rake us fore and aft, and thQ excitement is quite Crimean. Under these circumstances some of the afflicted have sub. scribed a considerable sum to be spent in law against the Eastern Counties Railway Company, and there are soma vulnerable points ; such as, for instance, that the train due at Fenclurch-strect at 9.58 am. never reaches it till 101 or 10.15; and a quarter of an hour a day for 100 men inz business is worth, say, about 25. a-week-, for which the company is clearly liable. But many of us think it useless to solicit or atack a corporation, having neither heart nor parts, to persuade or kick; and we do not wish to aggravate the feud, but rather to appeal, through you, to public opinion, and to the indiTidual shareholders, whom we beg hereby to warn:-lst. That settlers in thefarforest are resolving andpreparing todecamp, and go elsewhere; 2d, that others at nearer stations are in ominous communication with omnibus proprietors; 3d, that others who used to ride first class now will not-not simply to spite the company, but to recoup themselves for the extra sixpences extorted to Statford ; 4th, that in the present state of feeling it would be easy for us to orgauize a general scheme of self-defence, and mutually pledge our selves to take third-class tickets till the obnoxious changes re repealed; and then they must either find us carriages ofthat class, or carry us in better carriages, either wvy at a low rate, ad infinitum; fifthly, that excursionists will be re luctant to expose themsolves to the expense and peril of trips by the line as now conducted; and, lastly and genae rally, that it is better to accomm odate than disgust your customers. If you walk into a baker's and ask fur a buns and he, instead, hits you in the eye, you do not go there again, and you deter your friends. So with railway companies and the public; the Eastern Connties Railway Company annoy us with vexatious and petty acts oE tyranny and restriction; in return, we deprive them ot every penny of our own which we can by fair means keep from them, and we celebrato them to our friends and the public by the unpleasant extension of their signifilant initials into such flattering phrases as the " extremeld cantankerous," and "extensively cursed " railway coo pany.
