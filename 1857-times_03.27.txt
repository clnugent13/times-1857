I am an advocate for a thorough reform of all abuses, In whatever department they may bs found to exist, and for the greatest possible seduction of Otaxation which is comipatible with the maintenanc-e of our civil and tailiterj esteblishments in a state of efficiency. In regard to the Income-tax, Iamn of opinion that It ought notto beresorted to excePt in time of war, or unuder ciromrsetonces of gret ermergency anud I shall therefore advocate its total extinction at the earhiest p)ossl'le moment, and this object Amiud ho kept In view In&all financialt arraugemnenie sanctioned by Parliament.
The conduct of Sir John Bowring, the Representative of the British Government in China, is, in my opinion, meet unjustifiable, and cal. culiated to lower Encland. assa Christian nation, in the eyes of the wh ole world, andI I think Lord PAlmerston war much to blame for not bav.ng auDnerededl him at onoe, a course which he has only'now adopted, after the late aslverm voet of the House of Commons.
I am anxious to see sreat efforts made to impDrove the education of the people, and the social condition of the working classes.
I shall at all tines watch over the interesta of the freemen, and be red odefend their privilaes, both pecuniary and political, when attacked oby theiropp3nente.

The railway-market was fairly supported, and, in some cases a further advance of 6s. to Los. per share took place. Lancashire and Yorkshire experienced a alight reaction, sales haying been pressed to realize profits. Indian were steady, and French exhibited inrmness. Northern of France closed at an improvement. Grand Trunk of Canada, and Great Western of Canada, were in better demand, especially the former. Few transactions occurred in the shares of the joint-stock banks, but quotations presented heaviness.

Vandalism At Dover.
VA NDA LISA! AT DOYR?B.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES.
Sir,-The spirit of destructiveness has been so active and daring among our most interesting ancient national monu. mnents that you wil not be surprised thatj two of the few remaining are in great jeopardy, and that one of them is actually condemned to be pulled down.
The Roman Pharos and the Saxon church upon the heights of Dover, tbough probably sa" but unknown to the majority of the thousands of tourists who yearly pass by them to visit objects of antiquity in other countries, are well known to and appreciated bytho better educated classes; and even many of the inhabitants of Dover itself have a certain respect and affection for these noble landmarks of two distinct historical epochs. I need not point out to you the peculiar features which make these edifices dear to the antiquary and to the architectural student.
The Pharos, I believe, is not yet destined to be pulled down, although its doorway is blocked up vwith modern masonry under orders which emanated from the late Duke of Wellington, who had no feeling for the remarkable details of the interior architecture of the building.
But the Saxon church which stands by its side is doomed to make way for some building about to bo erected, and for which, by the knowledge, consent, ana order of the Government, a contract has been taken. The church has long served as the coalhole of the garrison, and, as the public has tolerated the desecration, the Government probably concludes it will not object to see the ancient structure en. tirely removed.
But, Sir, I hope, through your aid, to inform the Go. vernment that it would bh wel that some inquiry shonld be made before the Saxon church be destroyed. I believe that Lord Panmure will not for a moment ratify the contract after be has become convinced of the great interest attached to the condemned structure by the better informed classes, not only of Great Britain, but also of France and Germany, mny of whom I have been pleased to notice, on visiting England, have inquired with much curiosity about the ancient buildings at Dover Castle.
I am, Sir, yours respectfully,

PORlYwn'TP
The half-yearly meeting of this comoeny wAs *ppointed to be held yeaterday at the offioe, Great George-street, Westminster; Admiral Sir J. Stirling in the chair.
Mr. Horne, the secretary, read tha notioe convening the meeting, and a circular to the shareholders, stating that in consequence of the dissolution of Parliament several directors would be unable to attend, and it was therefore intended to adjourn the meetine to the 14th of May next.
The CHAnntAx sid that m accordance wlth the circular sent to the shareholders it was not proposed to go into any ether matter than the adjournment of the meeting to the day mentioned. He was therefore precluded from enterifgintoastatement of the affairs of thecompany.
* Mr. MowATr did not intend to interpose any difficulty in the way of the directors, but was advised that they had no power to adjourn the meeting, but that it should be left to the shareholders. They. were bound to prepare an account of the affairs of the company and balance-sbeet for the inspection of the sbareholders 14 days before the meeting. Ie could not understand why they should not have the statement of accounts presented, although it was proposed to adjourn the meeting.
The CBAMAw- said the statement had been prepared, sand was available to ny shareholder.
Mfr. MowATr, as a large'shareholder, holding 1,050 shares, was naturally anxious to know the state of the company's affairs, and whether they hid the mewns to complete the line.
The COHAiB3 had nothing to conceal from the shareholders, and trusted that, instead of it being considered a misfortune to hold shares In the company, the reverse would toon be the case, and that their affairs 'would be found in a tatisfactory position.
Mr. MowAT' asked several questions, in reply to which it was stated that in consequence of additional workl to those originally contemplated. more money would be required, hut that the borrowing powers would enable them to complete the line to Havant about the end of the year. The fullest information 'would be given at the adjourned ueeting in May, and it wa s believed would be considered very satisfactory by the shareholders.
The meeting then adjoed to the 14th of May next,
SCOTTISH NORTH-EAlSTERN.
The halIf-yearly meeting of this company was held at Aberdeen'on Wednesday; Mr. Stirling in the chair
xThe CHAIIRMA, in moving the doption of the report, an abstract of which has appeared in 1%c imes, expressed his regret that there had been a faling off in the receipts for traffic during the half-year. This arose entirely from the advanced rates put upon the through traffic by the 3nglish companies, and which still continued; but he was glad to say there was a prospect that in May next, in conse-
uence of new arrangements that 'were in progress, a change
or the better would takeplace inthis depattnent. The paen. ger traffic had greatly incrased during the half-year, and it waslexpected thatitwould show larger returns during the ensuing summer than ever had been realized on the line. With tegard to the expenditure it would be seen from the report that the worklng expenses were 45 per tent. This, in conrideration of the fact that they had to pay 30 per oent. more for their coals in the North of Scotland than was paid in England, was a low figure They had been able to effect reductions in various departments, the chief of which was in the locomotive department, the cost of which had been reduced more than 3 000L; while they hAd run 13,000 miles on the Dunkeld line more than they had run befor The directors had felt it their duty to oppose the Deeside Extension; but a protective clause had been agreed to which removed their objection. Upon the whole, he had
the fullest confidence in the present position and prospects of the comp ny. He movd the adoption of the report and k series of reso.utions declar tory of the dividends.
Mr. WATSON seconded the motion, 'which wa;s unsanimously agreed to.
The meeting then separated.
IME1RICE ANI FOYN8E.
The report of the directors of this com~pany states that the trafflc on the portion of the line from Limerick to Rathlkeale, 174 miles in length, showved a satisfactory result. The net receipts for the half-year ending the 3Lst of Deember
last, after deduction of working expenses, were equivalent to 1J per cent. per annum on the cost of the construction of that portion of the line. A further portion of the line to Askeaton would be opened in a few weeks, and in the course of the summer the opening 'would be extended to the terminus at Foynes, which would enable them to secur the l arge traffic to .ilkee during the autumn. The lo. of
40,00L from the Loan Commissioners 'would enable the directors to complete the lne to Foynes.

Joint-Stock Banks.
JOINT-STOCK BANK.S.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TiMES.
Sir,-Mr. Fadaile's examination on the affairs of the Royal British Bank, and Mr. Coleman's statement of the accounts of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation, ought to be suffident to satisfy the most speculative shareholders that no director or officer of a joint-stock bank ought to have any money accommodation from his own bank He ought not to be allowed to have any other than a deposit account and a drawing account.
In order that the Board may do their duty to their customers and their shareholders, they ought to be as rigorous in refasing accommodation and exacting payment in any one case as in every other; but this cannot be when the appli. cant or the creditor is one of themselves. Therefore, there ought not to be the possibility of the Board being plaeed in the false position of having to treat any person at the same time both as a friendly eolleague or confidential officer, and as a man not to be trmsted.
When the new 3Joint-Stock Companies' Act is amended, it is posible that Parliament may put some restrictions on the powers of directors to help themselves to the trnst moneyswhich are attheirdisposal; but,judgingfromthedi9iculty of eonstruing thatAct, it is at leastequally possiblethat the amending Act might not answer its purpose. There is, however, a legislative body with ample power to do what Parliament either may not do, or may do so perfunctorily as to be worth very little-a body which occasionally enacts a law in a few simple words, and is never found not to attain its object-I mean the Committee of the StockExchange; and I would beg your permission to appeal to them through your columns to take the matter up.
My own connexion with joint-stock banks is confined to my having a drawing acount and deposit acconnt with the London and Westminster Bank-of the perfect solvency of which I have not, of course, the least doubt. Bat I should be glad to have my absence of doubt converted into entire confidence. I should like to have something like a gEarantee that there not only is not, but that there is no chance of there being, any reason for fancying that my small balance might go towards making up an ugly item of 237,0001., and if I, who take matters easily, wouldc b glad to have such a
uarantee, there are probably some thousands of nervous people, having accounts with or shares in other banks, who would be more glad to have it.
I would therefore venture to submit for the consideration of the Committee of the Stock-Exchange whether they might not do a great service, not only to the customers and shareholders of all joint-stock banks, but also to the commercial credit of the country, by plaing a ban on all joint-stock banks which do not within a reasonable time (say before Michaelmasnext) make it an imperative regulation, that no pcuniary aecommodation sball be afforded to any of their directors or officers, and that none of the money of the bank shall be advanced on securities which cannot be realized when needed.
The reiul,tion might oceasion hardship to individual directors; but it would probably save some thousands of customers and shareholders from ruinous losses, and it would certainly give them les uneasy dreams than now haunt the pillows of many. Yours obediantlU

Court Of Common Council.
COURT OF COMMON COUfCIL,
THZ QvESTON OF nrIvILEGE.
Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public business.
'Sir W. IAGNA.Y.-M7 Lord Mayor and gentlemen,-I have now to ask the mdulgence of the Court for a few minutes while I allude to a circumstance deeply affecting myself, which took place at the last Court of Common Council. (Hear, hear.) I feel that I have reason to complain that in my absence upon thst occasion matters so deeply affecting me were brought before the Court without any previous intimation-without giving me the opportunity of attending to offer any explanations, or to stbsoit myself to any questions which any member of the Court might have thought proper to put to me. (Hear, hear.) I am satisfied that hsd I had the opportunity of offering such explanationN the referencewhich bas been made to the law officers of the corporation would not have been of the character that it now is. I am satisfied that if I had stated to this Court that the matters which had been under investigation in Brussels had been thoroughly and fully investigated here by the shareholders of the company, with every Inowledge of the facts connected with them,-that they had been fully passed, and a discharge given on the recommendation of the directors, and with their knoweoge of the parties,-if I had had the opportunity of stating that although this discharge, which was final and legal here, had been ripped up again at Brussels, but that when opprtunities were offered to the parties accused to justify their conduct, the evidence was such that
in immediate acquittal was given in their favour, a totally differentimpressionwouldhavebeen entertained But whenI find that the matter has been taken up in a judgment given upon an appeal against tbat which took place in Brussels 18 ibonths after the matter had been settled; that it was a judgment in the absence of the accused, and without one tittle of evidence, coming as it did, accompanied with the observation that among other things Sir WiUiam Magnay nd others had been charged with appropriating no legs than >8,0001. of the oompanys money; ifI had stood here in my place as I do now, and had declared to you before God and man that not one-hundredth part of the fraction of a farthing ever came into my possession, either directly or indirectly, or in any way whatever; that, in point of fact, I did not even know the parties to whom the advanoe was saade; that I was out of the country when the important prt o the transaction took place, prosecuting the budness of the affairs of the company Paris sand in Brunssels; if I bad stated these things and this judgment was not a final judgment, but was again subject to appeal, I am stisfied that this Court as Englishmen, and as men desirous of doing jvstice between man and man, would have accompanied that reference, if they had made it at all, with a power on the pkrt of the law officers to examine me, and to examine the ppers, and to report thoroughly upon the whole trans. Actions of the case. That not having been done, I took the earliest opportunity, as I felt myself bound in support of my character to do, to appeal to the Court of Aldermen. As I found that the law, officers had not the power to go into the investigation Iappealed to my bret= of the Court of Aldermen to go into the matter thoroughly and fully, to sift it from the top to the bottom. I did not app to them as comrades to pro.
ctaend shield me, I stood before them as an honest man sand asked them to go freely, fully, thoroughy, and fearlessly into the investigation, and to report their opinon as to whether I have not been able to clear myself from the scandalous and libelous charges which were made against me. I will not now detaln the Court by any details, as I shall hereafter have an opportunity of going into the matter fdly. I think it uncourteous that the gentleman who brought the matter forward did not give me notice of his irjtenion todo sO. (Cries of "Not at alL") At all events, tiV deprived me of the opportumity of making such Stltements as I think woud have awardedl a larger allkiont of wer to the law officers and wouldl have eabled re to justify myself in Away in which otherwise
Mr. BLA gL-My Lord Mayor, I feel deeply grieved that
Sir William Magnay should think that he has a jusgt cause
of complaint against me in having omitted to give him notice of the motion which I made at the last Court. When I entered the Court upon that occasion I had no knowledge whatever of this circumstances of the case A newspaper was put into my hands within the court, and I saw upon the face of it that, if the statement it conitained was correc; Sir Wiiagm Mpaay had forfeited hi3 right toV a sct in this court, inasmuch as by the act passed in S9 Any person who has become bankrupt, or taken the benefit of-tbe lnsolvent Debtoes Act, or been convicted of frud, immediately forfeits-the word in the act is " immedatel-his sat either as a member of this Court, or as a member of the Court of Aldermen. Now, what was the Fubetance of the motion which was unanimously carried upon that occasionI It was that the truth of that state. ineut as it appeared in the Momninq Chronidc should be in-
iired into, and, if affirmed, that the law officers should report how fsr Sir W8lliam Magnay had become disqualified omholdinga seat in Uiis courtn I apprehend that there couldbenothing whatever personal in that. Sir William Magnay hada summons to attend this Court. Sir Wiliam Magnav knew perfectly wel that that paragraph had appearedin the papers three daysbefore, and thereforehecould nDt suppose that 200 gentlemen sent here by their con-
stituents from a knowledge of their position and personal character, and knowing alO by what qualification they held their seats in this Court,-he could not suppose but that some one oe t of the 200 oonldask some question with regard to that statement. (Hear, hear.) Sir William MAgnay now asks to-day, as he has repeated in another place, that the inquiry may be of a larger kind. I am sure that Sir Willam Magnay has acted in his capacity of magistrate in the city too long not to be aware that it is out of the power of the Court to erect or to institute itself Into a tribunal to re'iew the decision of a court of law, And that we must be bound, not by what our opinions nay be (and I am delighted to hear him a that he has not been guilty of what is imputed to him), but woe must be bound by the letter of the Act i and if it shall appear that that gentleman, in the opinon of the law officers, has been convicted of a fraud, there is only one other question that remains,-namely, whether the construction of the Act maeans a fraud committed in this country, or whether it takes cognizance of a fraud committed elsewhere beyond these dominions. I am not a lawyer. I do not attempt to explain the nice refinements of a clause in the Act which may admit of various constructions, but I know that that Act was obtained at the solicitation of this corpoation, with a view of securng the perfect purity of this body and the respect for us out of doors of our constituents and the world at large I know full well what the intention of the corporation was in asking that a person convicted of fraud ehould be disqualified fromi holding a seat in this Court. And therefore, however desirous as individuals we may be to see Sir William Mainay' exonerated from this charge, vwith the conviction still existhing whatever disposition w,e mayhave to lend him our indidual efforts to get that conviction revoked, it is hia duty to obtain that revocation before, as far as I understand it, he can be entitled to a seat in this court I trust that the Court will do me the justice to believe that I am Influenced by no personal feelings whatever in this matter. (Hear, ear,) I utterly disclaim any motives whatever of a personal character. I am guided solely by that ingle object which influenced Us all When We obtained tho Act-namely, that we should secure the pd ect respectabilty and undoubted reputation of the members of this Court. (Hear, bear.) I for nne should rejoioe most sincerely in seeing that Sir William Nagnay obtained a revocation of that verdict, but I apprehend that nQ further proceedings can be taken in the matter until our own officers have reported upon the subject. We cannot review the verdict of a regular court of law, inasmuch as if we attempted to set aside a verdict of " Guilty" we might hereafter, when a man has been acquitted, review the verdict and convict that man. Such an act on the part of a Court consituted as we are would only bring down upon us the unmitigated ridicule of the whole world. Iam sure that Sir William Magnay would not expect us to take such a course, and I trust that he will wait patiently for the result of the deliberations of our law officers.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-May I ask whether Sir Villiam Magnay follows up the statement he has made with any request? I do'not think he followed It up by asking for any extension of the inquiry on the part of the Court.
Sir W. MAGyAY.-I do not foUow It up by such a request, because the Court of Aldermen have undertaken to remedy that deficiency. I should have submitted myself to any course which this Court thought proper to adopt, inasmuch as the reference is limited to the question as to whether such a verdict has been found.
the CIT SoLiciToR-My Lord Uayor, application has been made to me by the chairman of the committee of aldermen to whom the matter just alluded to by Sir Wllliam Magnay stands referred, that I should hand over to that committee when obtained, copies of the officil documents in the Bellgan Court for which I have applied. I feel, ard my professional friends advise me, that without the a thority of this Court I cannot with propriety hand them over for the use of the committee of aldermen. I apprehend that this Court wiU give me leave to do so ; otherwise I shall be obliged upon their direction to make application to the Belgian Court also, and shall have two copies of the game docaments. I apprehend I should be discharging my duty to this Court were I to hand those over for the use of the committee of aldermen as soon as I receive them. (ear, hesr.)
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR.-That will be exceedingly objectionable. If Sir W. Magnay is not satisfied with the motion carried in this Court as to the nature of the inquiry.
let it be extended in suchmanrswil ethsvew
but let there be but one committee of investigation andc one' report. (Hear, hear,) What more can berequired? Why should there be two investigation two committees of inquiry, aud two reports? Let there be but one feeling her-naely tht i Si W.Magayis not gauity-and
Sir W. l!AGNAY.-I feel much indebted to the worthy mnover of the motion, and I shall feel deeply obligedl to this
Court if they will so extend the reference as to meet theI entire case,
The City Solicitor was then Instructedl to furnish copies of the various documents to the Committee of Aldermen, and the subject dropped.

CITY ELECTIO1.
TO TH EDITO6 OF TEIE TIMES.
Sir,-It is said that the Conservatives of the City are in a state of apathy. The City Coneervatives are just the same men they have always been. But they are struck dumb by the conduct of their leaders in the Parliamentary session just terminated.
In that conduct they can see nothing but a mere striviug for power. In the debates on the budget and on the Chineso question, they can recognize no impulse beyond that ot party hostility carried to the highest pitch. They believe that the gratification o' this party spirit has placed in periI 3ome highly important national interests.
The City Conservatives have, therefore, asked themselves this question-whether they are associated together merely to bring into power one set of stateemen to displace another cet,-or whether some higher mission does not belong to them?
Far from bringing forward a candidate to oppose the Go. vernment of the day dimply because it bears the attribute of Liberal, my impression is that the Conservatives whho may vote at all on Saturday next will vote in support of thi existing Government.
W'hat, in fact, are we to gain by a change of Ministers? Can we forget that when Lord Derby was commanded bq the Qneen to form an Administration, the first man he in. vited to join him was Lord Palmerston? Does any 4cri
doubt that if, when the news of these events in China arrived, Lord Derby had been in power, he would havo done otherwise than as Lord Palmerston has done ?
The true Conservative policy at this moment is e) strengthen the bands of the present Government. After doing that, lot us quietly but deadily insist on such mean sutes of domestio improvement and social amelioration as may be prudently undertaken. It will be the policy sad, I trust, the inclination of the Government to grant them. It they do not, then lot the nation take the matter into their own hands, and use those means which they constitutionally possess-of ejecting them from power.

The Schools In Golden-Lane.
THB SOHOOLS IN GOLDEN-LANE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIEES.
Sir,-With reference to the report in to-day's limcs of the public dinner presided over by Lord John Russell to celebrate the opening of the schools recently established by the Rev. William Rogers in Golden-lane, I venture, as an old admirer of Mr. Rogers, to soEcit space enough in youx columns to explain that the schools in question, although intended for the most ragged of children, will be among some of the least ragged of schools.
Your reporter may very easily have gathered his imprees sion of Lord John Russell's remarks from the character which his Lordship gave of the scholars, but he never employed, so far As my memory serves me, the word "ragged"' as descriptive of the schools, or of the method to be pursued in them.
Mr. Rogers himself, in his address to Prince Albert on the l9thinst., was veryexplicit in pointing out that "some. thing more was needed in order to improve the condition of Golden-lane than the machinery of ordinary ragged schools,
and that his own plan was " to erect schools of such size and completeness, and to maintain them in such thorough efficiency, as would secure even to the poorest as good an edneation as could be brought to any." The plan was not new to him. From 1847 forward there has been no improve. ment in the means of popular education of which he has not been one of the first to avail himsel£ His schools have always been good enough to secure for him a large staff of Government apprentices-15 per annum upon an average ot the last nine years, and at this moment 19, under three older assistants, and four certificated teoachers; Tho buildings, furniture, and appliances of hin schools have always been maintained upon a corresponding scale, and might challenge comparison with those of any elementary school in the kingdom. How he has contriyed, and contrives, to do all this thoso who best know both his powers and his self-devotion can only tell imperfectly. But the fact remains to distinguish broadly his method froma that pursued by the promoters of ordinary ragged schools, who do not claim,and would commonly repudiate, the prin. ciple that education must be as well armed for good as its antagonists for evil, when it grasps vice and ignorance by the throat in their own den. Thricg armed is he that hath his quarrel just. True; but there is another maxim about the dryness of powvder. Mr Rogers's success is analogous, not to miraculous victories, but to the long-prepared triumphs of disciplined valour. We admire the former when we believe them, but we reserve our best honours for those who achieve objects in
,hich we sympathize by means which we understand. Mr. Rogersproceeds by the ordinary road. But how does he manage to keep it 1 ln the answrer to that question, uot inz the smple fact of success-wrhich follows naturally enough from the immediate antecedents-lie his secret af11i praise.
I am, Sir, your obedient ppri's,.t

NOMTNATIONS AND PtBLIC MEETINGS.
WESTNMSTER-
'ihe niomination of candidates for the representati on of thlis city took place yesterday, at hustluga erected in front ef St. Paul's Churcb, Covent-garden.market. As it was lkcwan that no opposition would be offered to the return of tbe late members, Sir Do lacy Evans and Sir John V. Shilley, the proceedings excitedcomparatively little interest. A few minutes before 12 o'clock, the time appointed for the commencement of the proceedings, the candidates, attended lby a number of their leading supporters, appeared upon the hustings, and were greeted with cordial cheers by a crowd of some 1,500 persons, the great majority of whom were evidently non-electors. Punctually at 12 o'clock the proceedings were commenced, and the usual preliminaries having been gone tbrough.
The HIGH B.AILIsF said he had no doubt the late anembera for the city, who had appealed to their constituents for re-election, would be able to give a satisfactory explanation of their post conduct, should they be required to do so, and if the electors thought proper again to repose confldence in them, be would bave tbe greatest pleasuie in putting his seal to their return. (Cheers.)
Dr. BAINBRBIDGE, in proposing Lieut.-General Sir De '*acy Evans as a fit and proper representative, expressed his gratification that the gaUnt general's health was completely zestored, and recommended him for re-election as a firm .supporter of progressive improvement, of a large extension of the franchise, of the spread of education and enlightenment among the people, of a large reduction of taxation, &ad of religious toleration.
hMr. HI G. ROBIN;SOr seconded the nomination, and observed that the gallant general's services in the field, as vell as i Parliament, had earned for him the universal -re rd and approbation of his fellow-countrymen.
'(Mc ers. )
MIr. H. BIDGOOD nominated Sir John ViUiers Shelley, 'wo, he said, had fulfilled all the pledges he bad made to tUe electoas when they returned him as their representative in 1852. Mr. Bidgood expressed a hope that the city of 'Westminster would be incorporated [A voice.-" Do you -Ws 'at turtle i] (Iaughter), and that their excellent high
iff would be the first mayor. (Cheers.)
J- Mr. JosEsPH GEOSaX seconded the proposition.
No other candidate having been proposed,
bir D. L. EcvANs addressed the meeting and said, there wtre two subjects which appeared mainly to occupy the attention of candidates at the present election,-the first was their own particular claims eand merits (a laugh), and the secc,d was the recent occurrences at Canton. On neither ef thece topics did he mean to say a word, but he would leave them to judge whether his humble merits so far counter'balanced his demerits as to entitle him to continue to act as their representative in Parliament. (Cheers.) He would, however, advert to one or two events of some political im,portance which had taken place since the dissolution of Par. iiament. There were few of those present, whether electors 'or ron-electors, who did not feel deep interest in the progress of Sardiniaa State which had not only recently adopted free and representative institn.tions, bu which had nobly and manfully borne a part with tllS in tho Crimean war. (Cheers.) Since the dissolution of -3?arlament the Government of Austria had complained of t e lberty of the press at Turin, had withdrawn their Ambassador from the Sardinian Court, and had evinced a disposition to proceed to hostilities. Now, Lord Palmerston nad often been blamed for a disposition to meddle rather too nnueb in foreign affairs, but he (Sir D. L. Evans) would venture to ea; tbist if Austria should dare to interfere with the cascent liberties of Sardinia, the high-spirited people of this country would compel Lord Palmerston and his colleapues, whether it pleased them or not, to throw the agis of this empire over the Sardinian State. (Cheers.) Be might remind them also that the independence of Sivitzerland-an oasis of liberty in the midst of despotic military States-was even now menaced by Prussia. The non-interferenoe of the British Government in favour of Switzerland had beea cited as a
roof of their padfic disposition, but he would have fiked the Government much bet if they had interfered, for they had the power of coercing Austria and Prussia in both the cases he had mentioned. (Cheers.) [A voice.- "What about the Princess Royal's dovry."] Oh, he (Sir D. L. Evans) would take care about that. [A voice.-" Will you vote for 70,0001. ?"J Oh, no. (Cheers.) It was now nearly 25 ycars since he first presented himself to the electors of Westminster, and after having returned him on Tormer occasions in spite of the determined opposition of the Conservative party, they had added to their kindness by allowing him to absent himself from his Parliamentary duties for three years on military service. [A voice.-" If your advice had been taken Inkermanu wouldn't have happesied.] (Cheers.) He had been, as far as he could not only their political, but their military representative [A voice. -" You've done your duty."] (cheers), and although it had been stated in some quarters that he was past work, he was glad to say his health was so completely restored that he would be enabled to discharge his Parliamentary duties diligently and vigorously, if they honoured him with a renewal of their confidence. (Loud cheers )
Sir J . SHELLEY said he now appeared for the second time before the electors of Westminster to ask the honour of being returned as their representative to Parliament. He would unhesitatingly affirm that during the time he had sat in Parliament he had not given a single vote which did not tend to the furtherance of those principles to which he declared his adherence at the last election. (Cheers.) Undoubtedly among 15,000 electors there must be men who would find fault with some of his votes, but in every instance ibe had acted upon an honest conviction of daty. (Cheers.) Be had been reaUy what was caUed " an independent mem. ber ;" he had voted both for and against Governments, and he was prepared to defend every vote he bad given. He appeared before them at the last election as an untried man, but, as a landowner and a large farmer, he had previously been a candidate upon free-trade principles for the county with which he was connected; and wben he told them that county was Sussex they might readily believe that he got a tolerably Rood thrashing. (Cheers, and laughter.) The great question of freetrade against protection was now settled, and all the best farmers in the county of Sussex adniitted that free trade had proved to them-as he believed it had to the commnerce of the country -the greatest possible blessing. (Cheers.) The coup de 95acV had been given to protection, and those who were for. nerly the bitterest enemies of free trade were now its warniest supporters. He had on all occasions voted La favbur of an extension of the franchise, and for the ballot. (Cheers.) The question of Reform was now before the country, and he believed they had as good a chance of obtaining measures of Reform from the present Adminis. tratmn asthey had had at any former period. (Cheers, and some indications of dissent.) The matter rested, however, with the constituencies. (Cheers.) If they returred determined men, who -would not shrink from pressing the question in Parliamen4 they might depend upon it that the great binister who had shown himself worthy to rule the estinies of this country would not disregard the popular feeling. (Renewed cheers.) He could only say that if the (Government did not bring forward measures of Reforrm he would oppose them on every occasion. If a proposal ,were made to incorporate the city of Westminster it would receive his support, but the local Management Act, recently passed, enabled the inhabitants of the metropolis to exercise control over the local administration of their respective districts. He was decidedly opposed to church-rates, for he thought the time had arrived when men should not be called upon to contribute to the support of a religion from which they consdientiously dissented. tCheers.)
The HIGi BAnLIFF then took a show of hands, and declared the two candidates duly elected.
Sir D. L. EVAls tbanked the electors for baving returned himl as the first member of the new Parliament, and, referring to the contested election for the ciy of London, observed that he had had a sort of fracms with Lord J. Rus-ell some time ago, but he appreciated the valuable servicts rendered by that noble lord to the cause of civil and religious liberty, and would think it a disgrace to the constitnescy of the city of London if they rejected him. The hon. and gallant officer concluded by movintg a vote of thanks to the High Bailiff.
Sir J. SflEEILxY expressed his acknowledgments to the electors for the renewal of their confdence, and seeonded the vote of thanks.
The motion was carried by acclamation, and the High Bailiff having briefly returned thanks, the proceedings tersminated.
CITY OF LONDON.
A crowded meeting of the electors was held yesterday at Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate-ptreet ; Mr. Metealf Hopgood took the ehair at half-past So'Wlock.
Mr. Alderman SALTosloNs, in moving the first resolution, expressed his conviction that Baron Rotbschild had been greatly misinformed when he stated that the course which lie (Alderman Salomons) had takcen, bad prejudiced the Je. i.h question with the House of Peers. He believed that on the contrary, the course he had adopted had been favourable to the Jewish cause. (Hear.) The Jewish electors claimJed to exercise the same freedom of judgment which other electors enjoyed, but, whatever individu&s might do, it would be a disgrace to the Jowish electors of the city if they were to vote as a body against Lord J. Russell. (Applause.) He snoved:-

Mr. F. LAWIt?sCes seonded the motion.
Mr. MoosRt opposed the motion; btxl after making repeated attempts to obtain a hearing was compelled to retire under a storm of hisses.
The resolution was then agreed to, with only three distenients.
Mr. ABRAHAm then moved the next resolution, condemning the dictatorial conrse taken by the Liberal Registration Association.
Mlr. BoBtrEy seconded the resolution, which was supported by Mr. BBA1.
Mir. BNNOCH stated that Mr. Pearc% of Ludgate-hill, had, for the satisfaction of his friends, inquired of Lord J. RusseU whether it was true that before the first meeting of the Liberal Registration Association he had, directly or indirectlv, intimated that on the present occasion he would 2t come forward. To this Tery plain question Lord J. B Il had promptly replied by stating that, at one time, lhe nad intended to retire from the representation of the Citv of London, but that no one was authorized to declare that intention, nor was any one entitlod to presume that he meant to retire when the resolution of the Registration Association excluding him from the representation was proosed and passed. That insult and attempt at dictation to thse citizens of London put an end to any hesitation he might have felt. He considered he was no longer at liberty td oonslt hls own ease at the expense of the Inddepndence of the City of London, and thepresent stugl was the re. ra. (AP Unne.)

on moral political, economical, and legal grounds. They had no right on moral grounds tocondemn a man behind his back, and without giving him an opportunity of making his defence. On political grounds, was it not extraordinarv that a society enrolled for the advancement of Liberal opinions should attempt to impose a new qualification upon the representatives of the people ? (Applause.) The Liberal Xegistration Association had decIred that no representative ought to be elected for the city of London unless be were a commercial man. But in comnmercial firms was there not often a very useful man called the sleeping partner muchlaughter), but who, nevertheless, brought a great dea of capital into the concer ? (Hear.) The resolution of the association was also a mistake in an economic point of view, because there could be no mistake that his brother was a perfect naster of his work in this respect. It was also wrong in a legal point of view. A recent Act of Parliament regulated the limited liability of different concerns, but it did not provide that the liability should remain a secret. On the contrary it took measures to secure publicity, and directed that the names and objects should be placarded over the doors of the concern. Now, he had never seen the word " limited" attached to the title of the Liberal Registratiorn Association. (Laughter and applause.) It could not be, indeed, in the power of such a society to limit the respondbi!lity of the electors, and he trusted that the electors would not be dictated to by such a society. One of the speakers bad stated that his brother had done nothing
for 16 years; but that gentleman had forgotten that during! the six years in which his brother had been in office he had repealed 5,000,0001. of taxes, and had thereby brought comfort to many a humble home. An allusion had been made to the letter written from Edinburgh by Lord John Russell to the electors of the city upon the repeal of the corn laws. There had been a bad harvest, and his brother chose the right moment for his letter. A younger brother of his went in to Lord Heytesbury, who was then LordLieutenant of Ireland under the Peel Administration. He found him with Lord J. Russel's letter in his hand; and Lord Beytesbury exclaimed, "That has done our work." That letter did not put out the Conservative party, but it carried Free Trade. (Applause.) In politics it very often happened that one man sowed while another reaped. (Hear.) It might be reserved for some other person to remove the Jewish disabilities, but when his brother succeeded in carrying the Test and Corporation Act he commenced a course which had ended in his (Lord C. Russell's) becoming the guest of his friend, Mr. Alderman Salomons, at the Mansion-house. (Applause.) His brother's conduct at Vienna had been sharply questioned, but, as Lord J. Russell had said, the time had not yet come when every revelationhadbeenx made on this subject. It was sdfficient to remind them that when bis brother undertook this mission Sebastopol had not fallen. Would they have found any other man to undertake that mission? (Bear, hear.) There were not wanting people who said that it was a desperate mission for a statesman to undertake who was not versed in the arts of diplomacy. As the champion of England, his brother went out against all the world, and if be failed they ought at least to give him credit for his daring. (Applause.) There was another rumour to which he gave no countenance, and which he ought to apologize for mentioning-nawely, that this mission to Vienna was a subtle device of Lord Palmerston to get his brother into a net, in the belief that his reputation would be damaged, and that he must fail in his mission. Lord Palmerston was a man of high honour, and such a design was, he believed, entirely foreign to his nature. (Hear, hear.) le hoped that they would see these two great men goiDg hand in hand, and that the Reform party would again see them, as before, labouring tegether in the good cause. (Applause.) He trusted that any temporary wounds that might be caused by the Liberal Registration Association would be healed over, and that the electors of the city of London would, above al, support a good old Reformer, whose motto was "'Peace, Retrenchment, Economy, and Reform." (Loud
A vote of thanks to the Chairman ~hai been carried, three cheers were given for Lord John R a, nd the proceedings terminated.
FIN SBURY.
The lecture theatre of the London Mechanics' Institution, Southampton-buildings, was crowded last evening by electors anxious to bear an exposition of the political principles of Mr. William Cox, one of the four candidates for this constituency. Mr. Bennett, Chancery barrister, occupied the chair.
Air. Cox said, the genuineness of the 2,000 signatures and upwards to the requisition calling upon him to contest the borough had been caUed in question, but it lay at his central conimtttee in Islington, and le defied any one to make good that assertion. (Che,rs.) His object in convening the pres nt meeting was to supply any omissions in his printed address to the electors, which he believed set forth with all possible clearness his political principles. He would extend the franchise not only to every householder, but to every occupier of a portion of a house which was rated at 5. (Hear hear.) One of the first things which he had to do when he, 20 years ago, entered the office in which he learnt his profession was to prepare notices to quit against betsween 200and 900 tenants, because they had voted contrarily to the wish of their landlords, and from that time to the present he was convinced that nothing but the baUot could enable an elector to vote without the fear or influence of any man. He thought that the income-tax (which should only be imposed in time of war) should not affect incomes not exceeding 1501. He was in favour of national education, as he had raised himself to an honourable position by means of education. He would heartily support the establishment of free libraries, for of what service was it to a man to educate him if he could not obtain books and journals to read ? Although lie practised the legal profession, he was an ardent advocate of law reform, and had been for some time a member of the Law Amendment Society, whose president was Lord Broughaia-the greatest law reformer of the age-and w hose members included many gentlemen engaged in mercantile pursuits. It had been said that he had threatened to buy the constituency of Finsbury, and thus force his way into Parliament, but that was a monstrous calumny. [A Voice.-" Rothschild himself has not money enough to do that !"J Even if he had the means
of doing so, he knew better than to throw away his hard-. earned money for the purchase of any constituency, large or email. (Hear, hear.) If he had chosen to throw away his money for a seat in Parliamenthe might have been returned for 7501. for one of those small boroughs which were a scandal to our representative system, and which he would do his utmost to annihilate. (Cheers.) He was opposed to the desecration of the Sabbath, but he should vote for the opening of the 'British Museum and the National Gallery on Sunday so long as the Queen and the aristocracy were permitted to have their Sunday smusements. Hle believed that if thepeopleceasedaltogether fromn work on Saturday, or, at least, on Saturday afternoon, there would be no desecration of the Sabbath. (Cheers, and cries of " Oh!")
In answer to an elector,
Mr. Cox said, he was opposed to all State endowments Nhatever, but he would vote for the Maynooth grant because there was a contract between the people of Ire and and the Government of this country that Maynooth CoUege should receive Government support, and as long as the people of Ireland honestly performed their part of that contract they were entitled to the grant. (Cheers.)
Air. J. R. TAYLOB, of Chancery-lane, said he had subjected Mr. Cox to a severe cross-examination as to tie course which he woudi pursue if returned to Parliament, and as that gentleman had proved to his satisfaction that he would heartily support every movement for the religious physical, and inteilectual improvement of the people, be (Mlr. Taylor) had great pleasure in moving that every effort
houild b e made to secure his return to Parliament.
The resolultion having been seconded was carried amid e ud cheers, there being only a few dissentients.
TOWER HA MLTETS.
A requisition, numerously signed by electors, was presented to Mr. J. G. Holyoake, publisher, of Fleet-street to offer himself as a candidate, but, as the presentation 'was subsequent to the address of Mr. Ayrton, Mr. Holyoake deemed it his duty to refrain from dividing the extreme Liberal party in the borough. Mr. Holyoake addressed a public meeting at the White Raven, Raven-street, Wbite. chapel, last evening, in the uourse of which he aeknowledged the ability vith which Sir W. Clay dealt with the churchrate question, but remarked that he had failed to make a convert of Lord John Russell. With regard to Mr. Butler, he said that gentleman was, no doubt, the resident candidate, but he shouid leave the borough more frequently to attend to his Parliamentary duties. He advocated the election of earnest Reformes, who should insist upon national suffrage as the best measure of State education, and as a measure which would render natioral education . ievitable,-upon civil and religious freedom, which should include all who hada conscience,and upon the establishment of home colonies on waste lands, so as to save poor-rates and train useful emigrants. It was the choice of members without responsibility which led to administrative incapacity. They should choose men whlo had zeal as well as honour, who were earnest as well as able, who would work as well as vote, who would lead as well as represent, who would not only preserve the character of the constituenoy, but make their principles a power as well as a name in the nation.
A resolution was passed regretting the unselfish decision of Mr. Holyoake, and expressing a hope that he would allow himself to be put in nomination on a future oceasion.
SOUTHWARK.
As the day approaches which is to decide the election the excitement increases, and the exertions of at least two of the candidates, Sir C. Napier and Mr. Locke, are proportionately augmented. By each of these gentlemen several meetings are addressed each day, and now that the weather Is not altogether unfavourable for open air gatherings, they also are had recourse to. As it is impossible to pay domiciliary visits to a tithe of a constituency 'which comprises upwards of 10,000 voters, the candidates adopt the next best mode of cultivating the ac9uaintance of the electors-that of holding frequent distrsct meetings, with the view of bringing themselves and their principles, as it were, " home to every man's door."
Yesterday forenoon Mr. Locke, after a canvass amon
the tauners of Bermondsey-a numerous and influential class upon the register-held an open air meeting in front of the Leather-market Tavern, and as the hour selected was that allotted to the workmen's dinner a very large number of them attended.
Dr. CHA.UCx havlng briefly introduced the candidate to the assemblage,
Mr. LocIx presented himself, and his address was listened to with marked attention. He stated that he had that mormnig been canvassing through the different yards in the neighbourhood, and that the promises of support from the workmig men, compared with the refusals which he had met with, were as 20 to 1. It was highly gratifying to him to be able to make that statement, because those promises had not been made in ignorance of what his prlnciples were; and it showed naot only that those principles coincided 'with
the feelings and wishes of those whom heo was addressing, but that they believed him to be an honest man, readyio carry outtheirviewsand opinions. (Cheers.) If hisfriends w ould but continue their exertions be was as certain
as that be wasstanding ther,that on Honday
xt he should herd theJ poL. One subject shit .
had been urged upon him In every yard was the right of worldng men to eccupy themselves. apon the Suwday as they pleased. On thinspoint his opinions were clear. He reverenced the Sabbath, and he tbought that no man should neglect his religions duties upon that or any other day; but he would not force men into churches by Act of Parliament. He would open the British Museum and the National Gallery upon that day, because that which tended to improve the mind and to soften the manners never could injure; and he believed that If auch means of improvement and instruction were open to hina a maa would be the better fitted to dischargo hie religious obligations. (Loud cheers.) For these reasons, as well as upon the abstract principle of liberty, he would sanction no unnecessary interference with the rights, privileges, or pleasures of the people. Having run through the heads of hie published address, and having answered satisfactorily a questio with regard to emigration put to him by Mr WV. Osborne, who said that he attended as the delegate of 20,000 working men from Smithfield, he coneluded b7 reiteratin his belief that his opinions afforded a fithful refex of those of the great body of the electors, and that therefore, if returned to Parliament; he should be, in one of the strictest senses of the term, their "representative."
On the motion of Mr. REDGRAVE, seconded by Mr. BAxTso, the usual vote of confidence in the candidate was passed with about six dissentienti, and the proceedings terminated.
Mr. LocXE afterwards addre3sed other bodies of the electors at the Bell, Rotherhithe, and at the China-hall, Rotherhithe.
Sir C. NAPR' also held an open air meeting in the morning in front of the Bricklayers' Arms Hailway Statlon,where he had a very numerous and enthusiastc audience, and in tbe evening he had another large gathering at the "Gregorian," St. James's-road, Bermondsey.
LAMBETH.
A meeting of electors and others ws held at the Sehoolroom, lint-street, last evening; MIr. William Cook occupied the chair.
Mr. W. WrnuAms said he had supported the grant to Maynooth every session until the last. Then, however, havng voted against grants from the public taxes for ecclesiastical purposes, and having also voted in the last session for the first time for a committee to inquire into the appli
cation and use made of the great revenues of the Church of Ire)and, bo thought he should only be acting consisteantly with the principles he had laid down for himself by opposing the Maynooth grant. Previously to this he haa spoken to several Irish Roman Catholic members, and they quite approved the course he was taking, observing that the abolition of the grant was only aquestion of time. These were the grounds upon which he had altered his vote upon this question. As to his duties in the House of Commono, he ventured to say there was not a man there whose time had been so devoted to his Parliamentary duties as bish He had no other occupation, and he had given up a.lwas the whole of the day, and pretty nearly tho ,whole of the night, to the performance of his duties ; but he never was tired, for he considered himself bound to do all he could for his constituents and the country. His late colleagne (Mr. Wilkdnson) claimed to have voted a few times oftener than he had, but no gentleman present would walk across the room to vote one way or the other at the divisions from which he had been absent. With rezard to the income-tax, he found that his late colleague had Seen saying that his mnoton for the reduction of the tax upon incomes under l50I. a-year was only a piece of claptrap. He had, however, pledged himself at a meeting of his constituents, which took place some time before the question was brought on, to submit to the House a motion for the abolition of that portion of the tax, and he had given notice of this motion on the first opportunity possible, some time before 3Mr. Cobden's motion was brought on or the dissolution of Parliament was thought of. Against this motion Mr. Widkinson voted and spoke. But his late colleague insinuated that he was not respected in the House of Commons. [A voice.-" We don't want you to be."] Now, he would tell those present who were respected there. They were those members who supported the Government, right or wrong, and those only were disagreeable men (there were not many such) who, like himself, preferred the interests of the people to those of the Government. (Cheers.)
In reply to a question put with reference to the Metropolis Local Management Act, Mr. Wiliams stated that that Act, involving, as it did, a good principle-namely, that of representation and self-governmeit, had not, he considered as yet had a fair trial; bat if, after such trial, it was founa to work unsatisfactorily, he pledged himself to ass1st in obtaining its repeaL
A vote of confidence in Mr. Williams, ledzig the meeting to spport him, was moved by Dr. ars , nded bu La aite, supported by Mr. Culverwell, and carried uanamimously.
GREBNWICH.
Although the nomination of candidates for the representation of Greenwich takea place this morning, the borough did not yesterday present any appearances which would have led a stranger to suppose that it was on the eve of a contested election. Indeed, with the exception that hustings had been erected in front of the church at Greenwich, and that on the walls and in the windows of the shops there appeared afew placards inviting the electors to vote for the different candidates, there were no indicationsthat there wasabout to be an election at all. Notwithstanding this appearance of quietude, however, the committees of the several candidates were actively engaged in canvassing the electors, and the absence of public excitement was no indication of an absence of intereSt in the approaching contest. In the evening Mr. M. Chambers addressed a meeting at Woolwich, and the supporters of Mr. Townsend held a meeting at Deptford, at wimch that gentleman was present. The friends of Mr. Townsend are very sanguine of success, but it is probable that the result of the polling wall disappoint their expectations, and that the borough of Greenwich will in the next Parliament be represented by the two members who represented it in the last.
MlIDDLESEX.
Lord Robert Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury, the candidates for this county, met a number of their supporters at the public rooms, Uxbridge, yesterday, to give any explanations which the electors might desire. Mr. Ricardo presided.
Lord RoBBmT GRosvmoR was very well received, *nd entered at some length into a statement of his rinciples and opinions with reference to the chief topics of the day. He defended his vote on the Chinese question, and stated that he was adverse to the ballot.
Mr. HANBuxY also addressed the meeting, and *vowed himself an independent supporter of Lord Palmerston and a thorough Liberal. He said he should vote for Locke King's motion, and f or a voluntary system of education.
Resolutions supporting and approving Lord Robert Grosvenor and Mr. Eanbury were passed unanimously.
DOVER.
A fierce contest is being waged for the representation of this borough. Neither Lord Chelsea nor Mr. Rice, who sat for it in the last Parliament, the former as a Conservative and the latter in the Liberal interest, has thought it desirable to solicit a renewal ef the trust reposed in him at the last election, and there are no fewer than four candidates in the field, all of whom, except one-Sir George Clerk, a Peelte -are strangers to the constituency, though, as respects the local interests of the inhabitants, one at least. Mr. Bernal Osborne, the Secretary to the Admiralty, cannot fairly be included in that category, since his official Position in connexion with the present Government has necessarily rendered him familiar with their ancient harbour and with the works now being carried on for its improvement oa something like a gigantic scale. That position, indeed, of Mr. Osborne, and the intimate and constant communication into which it brings him, as the organ of the Admiralty, with the town of Dover, situated as it is directly in the great highway between England and the continent of Europe, have naturally induced him, on the organization of a new Parliament, to seek to represent it in the House of Commons and hsve given him, over and above his well-known ability as a man of business and a skilful debater, a strong claim on the suffrages of the constituency. The other Ministerial candidate is Sir William Russell, a Glocestershire baronet, who, like Mr. Osborne, is in the prime of life, and, besides, a man of extremely prepossessing appearance and frank manners. The two remaining candidates are Sir George Clerk and Mr. G. W. Hope, both Peelites, the former having, as will be remembered, been Secretary to the Treasury, and the latter Under Colonial Secretary during the Administration of Sir Robert PeeL They are acting on this occasion in open and avowed coalition, and not from any " fortuitous concurrence." This, with their identity of political sentiments, seems to have rendered a similar concert necessary or unavoidable on the part of Mr. Osborne and Sir W. Russell; the electors, at all events, have come to class the two latter gentlemen together, though in point of fact they act separately, or at least with the faintest possible show of coalition. Sir George Clerk has some slight advantage-if, indeed, advantage it beover all the rest in having previously represented the borough in Parliament; and, curiously enough, the father of lr. Osborne and Mr. Hope some years ago contested the borough of Weymouth, when the latter was returned, but unseated on petition at the instance of his opponent, the late Mr. Osborne.
The whole constituency of Dover numbers 2,024, of whom 902 belong to the class of freemen but, taling into account deaths, persons abroad, and duplicate entries, not more perhaps than 1,700 will vote at the approaching contest. At the general election of 1852,1,756 was the total number
who poUed, and on that occasion Lord Chel the Derb-te candidate, who was at the head of the poll, had 1,097 votes, -Mr. Rice 898, and Sir George Clerk, the unsuccessfal candidate, 781L
In the last few days Sir William Russell, Sir George Clerk, and Mr. Hope have been actively engaged in a personal canvass of the electors; but Mr. Osborne has held himself excused from taking a similar course in consideration of the onerous duties which his official position devolves upon him. He is however, stayingin the town, and has received so very gratifying a reception from the electors on the two occasions on which he has addremsed them in public meeting within the last week, and through his committee in their canvass on his behalf, that his auccess cannot be considered a matter of doubt.
The contest for the second seat wil probably lie between Sir William Russell and Sir George Clerk.
The nomination taL-es place to-day, and the poling on Saturday.
IPSWICH,
On Wednesday evening Mr. J. C. Cobbold and Mr. Henry J. Selwyn, the Conservative candidates for the borough, accompanied by Sir Fitzroy Kelly, the late M.P. for the eastern division of the count, nd who again offers himself for re-election, met at the Wellinoton Inn, Car.street, to address the " Conservative freemen with reference to the forthcomuing election for the borough of Ip4wich.
In the " good old times " tickets used to be distributed among the "i ndependent true-blue freemen," in order that thay might " enjoy themselves" with pipes of tobacco and their accompaniments; but these, along with the "good old times," have disappeared.
No tickets for such a purpose were viible, and some of the " true-blue old freemen feemed not to understand the non-obsevance of "ancient custom." Therewas however, a goodly mustr of freemen, sad a ltte after 8 o'clock the
chairwas taken by Mr. W. Adams, surgeon, cue of the freemen.
Mr. COBBOLD and Mr. SELwyN addressed the meetiDg, adverting to the various points set forth in their addresses, and stating their determinatiou to maintain the lights of the freemen.
Sir F. KELLY next addressed the freemen, observinu that lheir kindness to him 16 years ago would ever live m his memory whatever chances and changes of life he might undergo. He then reminded them that Mr. Selwyn wasthe son-in-lavv of Lord Lyndhurst, to whom they owed so much for preserving their privileges when they were about to be sacrifced by the Reform Bill, and called upon them to give Mr. Selwyn their support at the election, and to return him along with his friend Mr. Cobbold. With reference to Lord Palmerston, of whose liberality so much was now said, he observed that during the lonz period he had been in Parliame2t he had not been the auntor or even the chief sapporter of one great or useful measure - and why should they expect anything from him as the hesdof the Ministry?
A vote of thanks having been passed to the chairman and three cheers given for the candidates and Sir F. KleUy, Mr. H. G. BsisTosw announced that it was in contemplation to resuscitate tie Old True Blue Freeman's Club, which in times gone by was a "terror to their opponents."

A large meeting of the electors and inbabitants of Halifax was held in the Oddfellows'-haU on Wednesday night, MIr. A pI eard, ex-mayor, in the chair, supported by the Right .Hon. Sir Charles Wood, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Mr. Crossley.
The Right Hon. Sir C. WooD rose amid loud applause, and; after some introductory observations, said he should hbve been glad if at an earxier period he could have presented himself before them, consistently with that publi
duty which he had to perform in Londoi; bhut he was in attendance on his Sovereign in council on Saturday afternoon; he was engaged on important business with his colleagues at the Admiraltv until 11 o'clock on Monday morning, and at a quarter past U o'clock he was in his carriage on hisway to Halifax. (Applause.) He was gratified at the reception with which they had been pleased to honour him that night, as well as during a two days' canvass among the electors. He rejoiced again to find himself ssociated with those with whom in the borough, for the last 25 years, he had acted in promoting their common principles of public liberty andfreedom. (Hear.) He had passed many years in the House of Commons. (Applause.) lie had lived to vote for the freedom of Dissenters, for the repeal of the Roman Catholic disabilities, for the reform of Parliament, for throwing open municipal corporations, for the repeal of the corn laws, for the extinction of protection, and for the hberty of commerce without a shackle and without a bond. (Loud applause.) In that struggle he had fought in the House or Commons for upwards of 30 years, and he was proud to say that for 25 of those years he had been associated with the free, and enlightened, and inteligent electors of Halifax. He had never, however, asked for their anifrages merely as a personal favour. (Hear, hear.) It was incumbent upon us, cash in that condition of life in which it had pleased Providence to pbc us, to do our duty, not only in morals, but in pubc and political life; there were many men in Parliament abler and better than imself who could not afford to devote their time to the publc service in office or in Parliamentary lfe; the electors were chosen as trustees for the great bodyof the people; and norelectors as well as electors were bound to contribute to the formation of that Breat public opinion which, after all, decides affairs in this country. It was the business of Parliament to watch the conduct of the Minister, it was the duty of the electors to watbh the conduct of Parliament, and it was the business of the great mass of the people, nonelectors as well as electors, to look after the conduct of the electors of this country. Non-electors, persons not posessing the franchise, might exercise as large a share in controlling public opinion as the men who possessed a vote. (Hear.) He hsd always been opposed to secretvoting. Ministers, members, and electors, each in their plaoe, were but the trustees of the great mass of the people in this country. He was glad to find himself in open and free communication with the people of Halifax. Nine times he had been sent to Parliament as their representative, and this election would be the tenth time in 25 years. (Applause.) The more often he met them the more glad and pleased he was. He was not sorry to have a contested election. They had a gallant opponent in Major Edwards, whose only fault was that attribated to English soldiers-he did not know when he was beaten. (Loud laughter and applause.) Let them fight the battle honestly an fairly, as he believed they (the Conservatives) were doing; he differed from their principles from beginning to end, he bdieved that they would be found in a small minority, and that his hon. friend and himself would be returned as their representatives. (A. Voice. -" You're mistaken ," and another-" Don't backbite a man before his face !") (Great laughter.) His friend said he was mistaken. Three days hence would show whether he was. Having said so much upon these point4 the next thing upon which he wished to touch wras why he and his hon. colleague were there, because a dissolution of Parliament was not a very light subject. The state of affairs in the House of Commons was such that it became Tory evident from the beginnig of the session that the Government could not carry on the affairs of the country. The House of Commons was broken up into smaU sections, differing in every respect, uniting on one point only-viz., that no section had any chance of coming into power, except by uniting to overthrow the Government. The right hon. gentleman then reviewed the proceedings of the session, the attacks made upon the Mtinistry by MIr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli, the intention oE the Governmsent to abolish the war income-taxc, and to reduce the expenditue of the country to a reace rate, and then proceeded to state the facts of the Chnese question,-a move, he said, to which those who wished to overturn the Government were driven. The Chinese, early civilized,had not made much progress or improvement, and were in their treatment of oreners inhuman and barbarous in the extreme. Englishmen for years past were subjected to ill-treatment, murder, and indignities at which the mind of every Englishman must revolt; but that state of subjection and inferiority in which Europeans, and especially Englishmen, were held in China was put an end to by the stipulation of the treaty with China, and in the four ports thrown open to Europeans Englishmen were treated as equals. At four ports in China such had been the case; at Canton it had not; and it was only the other day that he saw the captain of a British man-of-war which had been
ent up to obtain redress for six British subjects who, going into the country for the mere purpose of amusement, were seized and barbarously murdered. (Hear,hear.) Application was made to the Governor of Canton. He promised to do something. He did nothing; and when Captaia Macdougal demanded that the bodies should be produced; maimed, mangled, and disfigured bodies were produced, cut to pieces in a manner which sent a thrill of horror through every one who saw them. (Sensation.) Some persons had connected this transaction with opium smuggling. Opium bad nothing whatever to do with it. (Applause.) No opium ever went to Hiongkong. (Hear, hear.) Opium was smuggled into China by Chinese vessels at Chinese ports, and those mandarins who openly professed to prohibit the traffic were commonly bribed to permit its introduction. (Hear, hear.) In order to put an end to the irregularities that prevailed, and make smuggling impossible, a register was adopted, so that any Crown lessee misht obtain a license to trade to Chiese ports This was disnctly recognized by the Chinese. (Hear, hear.) After detailing facts connected with the seizure of the Arrow, the right hon. gentleman said an insult of the kind mlght appear light and small as a cause of hostility, but if once they submitted to such insults and injuries they knew not to what extent such conduct might be carried; and the ultimate results might be much more serious than if they resisted insult aud injury inthe first instance. The opposition in Parliament was most unfair. They tried to raise a distinction between Sir J. Bowring and Sir Michael Seymour, to the prejudice of Sir John, and counted upon the support of the Tories, because Sir John had sprung from the people. (Hear.) He supposed he must not call the vote which led to the dissolution a coalition, or even a combination, though there was the fact that Mr. Cobden and Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone had combined in theirvotes. (Applause.) Whether, as Lord Palmerston had said it was "a concurrence of antagonistic atoms," it was cfearl a concurrence of antagonistic action. (Applause.) And Lord Palmerston appealed from the party vote in the House of Commons to the independent and enli'htened opinion of the country. So far as tbey bad been able to ascertain, the country was unted in upholding them in the course they had taken; Iand ii Hlifaax nobody held aU opinion contrary to that of
the Government of Lord Palmerston upon this Chinese question. (Laughter and applause.) aveon their hon. opponent, disagreeing with them as he did upon every other subj ct, declared that he would, had he been in the House of Commons, have voted with the Government. (Applause and laughter.) He trusted that the Chinese dispute would speedily be concluded byanhonourablepeace-apeacewhich snhold sive security to the property and lives of Englishmsen in China, increise our comperce theae, divese tho flessings of civilization to the oountless myriads of barbarous Chinese, ancd extend Christianity among them. (ApFplause.) The Government had been designated by the leader of the Opposition as " a turbulent and aeive Government," but they had brought to a honourable termination the Russian war-a war which they had not began; they had made pe_ce with Persls, and at the Same time secured the integrity of Herat; they had entered into a treaty for the final settlement of the vexed question of Central America; and they had taken measures which they hoped to see eventuate in
race and the extension of commerce and civilization in
'hina. (Hear.) Here, then, iu three out of four cases upon which Lord Palmerston's Governmenthad been unjustifil.ly attacked, so far from being " a turbulent and aggressive Government," they had secured the blessings of peace without compromising the honour and dignity of the kingdom. Loud cheers.) They had also been accused of not bnuging forward measures of reform,-a complaint which caume with a very bad grace, for those who made it were the very, persons Woo refused to support Lord Palmerston's Government in their efforts in that direction. (Hear, hear.) During the war no man would listen to any measure of internal improvement, and when, in 1853, the Government introduced a large mesure of reform, the House of Commons, by their votes, said that they were so fully occupied by the war that they could not attend to anythinR else. (Hear, hear.) He then came to the motion of Mr. Locke Sing, in the late session, to extend the 101. franchisa to counties. The Government had thought it necessary to oppose this meabure, not because they thou7ht an extension of the county suffrage undesirable, or that they had any objection to the 101. franchise in oounties. The greatest proof of that was that in the Bill introduced
in 1853 was contained a provision for extending, with I certain qailiications, the 101. franchise to counties. Ho wouldtell them why the Government objected to that ineasure. He did not think that every extension of the franchise was desirable. The old freemen were retained by the aid of the Tories, against the wish of the whole Lberal .pary and the Chandos clause in the Reform BiU, which was also the work of the Tory party, placed the rerentation of the counties in the hands of the landlord Lot them look at the effect of Introducing the l01, franchise into counties without any stri¢tion. He did not find fault with independent mem-
bes for voting for the motion. He did not blame his1 hon. friend Mr. Crossley for supporting that motion (lond cheers); but Government must frst ee what
the ooulda cary, and what qnalification they could
country -as not. On this point Mr, Overend said,In Sheffield there are more than b,000 voters. These repre. sent the agricultura interest, the church interest, the medical interest, the law interost, the shopkeeping interest, the merchant interest, and the artisan interest. Now, if you extended the suffrage to 51. householders, you would make the number of voters 15.000 or 20,000. Take them at 20,000. I-ow, suppose these 20,000 persons were all in this building, 5,000 on one side and 15,000 on the other; the 15,000 A ould be all of one class, and one class only, while the 5,000 would comprise all the classes who are represented. ICheers.) I am aainat monopoly, and I don't want to ga,ve to any one class the right of returning a member, as this would. I have no disrespect for the working class, but I say that it would be uufair to put such a power into th4ir hands that they alone would be represented and every other class would be swamped. (Hear, hear.) Mr. overend then wxent on amiid much interruption to say that he was against the ballot, which had been tried in France, Spain, and America, and faUed. A scene of much confusion ensued towards the close of the meeting, the ob. structives in the gallery keeping up a continued fire of abuse and ridicule on all who attempted to address the meeting.
MIr. WOSTriNH01-ie at length moved,-
" that. In the opi)nico of this meeting, 3Ir.William Overend does mo: reDreseat the opinions of the constttuency of Sheficid (applane and uproar), and, consequently, is not a fit Derson to represent this horough in Pasllnusot."
MIr. HARNVEY seconded the motion, which, after continuous uproar, was carried by a large majority.
NOTTINGIMI.
Yesterday was the nomination day for the borough of Nottinghan, and the proceedings took place in the Exchange-hailL. There are three candidates at the present election,-viz., the two old members, Mr. Walter and Mr. Paget, and the well-known Chartist orator, Mr. Ernest Joncs, who has been in tho town for some days past, and hvs been nightly enforcing his peculiar doctrines in the market place. The doors of the Exchange-hall were opened shortly before 10 o'clock, and the body of the haUl was immediately oeupied by a numerous force of Chartists, who, combined with the peace -at-any-price party, upon the show of hands carried the matter their own way, outvoting the electors who occupied places on the hustings. The result -was that their favourite candidate, ar. Ernest Joues, was declared elected in the show of hands, together with M;r. Paget; but not the slightest doubt is entertained that the choice of the electors of Nottingham will, at the close of the poll this day, be found to have fallen upon Mr. Walter and Mr. Paget.
On the hustings were the Mayor (Mr. Bradley), the sheriff (fr. Charles FelUdn), Aldernen Carver, Heard, Blirkin, Hart, Herbert. Heymann, Felkin, and Cullen; Councillors Mundella, W. Parsons, Thackeray, Beck, W. Knight, and Howitt; Dr. Massey, Messrs. S. Newhami, T. B. Charlton, J. Braithwaite, S. Bean, H. Hadden, F. Hadden, K. Swann, R. Entield, J. Bradbhaw, C. Swann (under sheriff), W. Cursham, T. Hopkin, Bailey, Brewster, T. Bishop, Truman, N. Dickinson, and A. Lowe.
The customary formal proceedings having been gone through,
The SHERIFF opened the real business of the day by requesting a fair hearing for each speaker-a request which, we regret to say, though to all appearance cordially responded to at the moment, was afterwards utterly disregarded by the Chartist portion of the assemblage.
Mr. S. NEwuAM proposed Mr. Walter as a representative for Nottinghama in the British House of Commons, and was glad to bring to their notice their old and well-tried friend. (Cheers and uproar.) It was 10 years since they first sent him to represent them in Parliament, and what reason had they to be dissatisfied with his. conduct? He had proved a good and stanch representative of the men of Nottingham, and had always given honest and independent votes. (Cheers.)
Mr. E. H_DDEn briefly seconded the nomination, stating that he would not detain the meeting, as they seenmed not inchned to listen.
After another appeal from the Mayor for an impartial bearing,
Mr. Alderman HART proposed Mr. Charles Pagetas a roper person to represent Nottingham. (Applalse.) We said that that gentleman had lived among them the greater part of his life, and was known to be attached to civil and religious liberty. Mr. Paget had directed his attention to the subjects of trade and agriculture, and he was well qualified to represent a commercial town like Nottingbam.
Mr. A. J. Mu?rnirLLA seconded the nomination, and characterized the vote of the majority on the Chinese question as a factious vote. Mr. Disraeli and his party cared not a whit for the Chinese. It was Downing-street that that they aimed at. The question was whether theopeople would have Palmerston or somebody worse. In the next Parlianment there must be an extension of the franchise, and he believed that Lord Palmerston dared not oppose it, hut if he did he must make way for a better man.
Mr. T. Honnie proposed another candidate (Mr. Samuel Fox), hut seemingly only for the purpose of making a speech, in which he abused Lord Palmerston, The Times, and Mr. Walter.
His nomination not being seconded fe hto the ground.
Mr. S. BEA.N, amid the applause of the Chartists, proposed " Mr. Ernest Jones as a candidate for Nottingham."
expressed a vwish to see aU the " humbug" bishops exLluded from the House of Lords, for they were, he said, a pest and curse, and supporters of oppression.
MIr. MOT r seconded the nomination. He alluded to Mr. Walter's vote on Mr. Locke Kng's motion, and trusted that the people would make the question of reform their great question.
Mr. WALTER then presented himself to the meeting, and was greeted with cheers mingled with expressions of disapprobation from the Chartists, who kept up a noise and uproar for so long a period that Mr. Ernest Jones felt caUeod upon to make a brief appeal to their feelings of fairness. A little calm being thus obtained, lMr. Walter proceeded to address the assembly. He said that, after the appeal just made to them by their friond Mr. Ernest Jones, they would hardly refuse to give him a fair hearing, for otherwise they would not be lovers of fair play and worthy of the name of Nottingham men, from whom he had always experienced fair play on former occasions. (Cheers and disturbance.) But there was no arguing with noise, and if those noisy gentlemen at the other end of the hall would be good enough to keep their mouths shut for a few moments, he would give them some nuts to crack by and by. (Laughter.) He would come to the point with them at once. Mr. Mott had alluded to his vote on a recent oc casion with reference to a question he knew to be interesting to them-Mr. Locke King's motion. He voted against that motion, not because he entertained any abstract objection to it, but because he thought it was tinkering with a great question. When Mfr. Locke King brought forward his motion three years ago, Lord J. Russell opposed it on the same ground, stating, that it was not the way to deal with the great question of re form. He (Mr. Walter) was as much and perhaps more of a Parliamentary reformer than Mr. Locks King. That gentleman's motion applied only to the country districts, and he wished that reform should apply as much to the town as to the country districts. (Applause, and cries of disapprobation, and here it may be as well once for aU to state that whenever Mr. Walter was cheered in the course of his speech, a counter demonstration was sure to proceed from the friends of the Cbartist candidate.) He was prepared when Lord J. RusseU brought forward the Reform Bill of 1854, to support it, if it had not been withdrawn, for a reason they were all aware of. It was put off in order that the war might be carried on without the attention of Parliament being diverted from it by other measures. He had already told them in his address that, so far from being opposed to Parliamentary reform, he thought it impossible ever to go on for many years together without revising the representative system. (Applause.) He wished every man among them to be in a condition to exercise the right of voting. Mr. Mott had told them that he admired what might be called express. train legislation ; but there was some risk in that. According to an old and very wise proverb, " The more haste, the worse speed ;" and some people, who were in such a desperate hurry to get on and have everything done at once, were very apt to upset the machine in the process. In his opinion the representative system must adapt itself to the
rowieg intellgence of the people. (Cheers.) A man, efore being qualified to vote, should at least be able to read and write, (Confusion.) Surely they did not wish to make the franchise so common a thing as scarcely to be worth picking up in the streets. It ought to be an object of ambition to every honest worldong man. (Cheers.) After the treatmenthe had experiencod in Nottingham, when ten years ago he was chaired round the town, lot it not be fanoied that he was afraid of the working men. He had employed hundreds of working men in his lifetime, and he believed there was not a m an in his establishment who would not go through fire
and. water to sere him. (Cheers.) Some of the persons 'Who had spoken that day bad alluded to his connexion with
a certaill journal. Now, if he should desire to go to the country on any question more than another, he conceived that the service which that journal had done thecountry would behis best claim to support. (Applause ) Had any among them been for truckling to Russia? 9 ad they been for an honourable or dishonourable peace-in favour of the army in the Crimea being properly attended to or starved? WFho was it that first enlightened them aU an to the state of the Briti-i army in the Crimea? (Cheers.) When almost every lDan in Parliament on both sides of the House was abousLig that journal for daring to speak the truth, who first directed the attention of the country to the disgraceful manner in which our army was being mailged in the Crimea? (" The Times," anda applause.) 'What other journal but The Times ever enjoyed sunh a mark of public coanfidelice as to have 20,0001. placed at its disposal, to be administered for time relief of the soldiers in the Crimea? (Loud cheers.) He was prouder of that transaction than of auy event in his life; and never before had such a thinj
been recorded in history as the placing of 20,0001. by the
public at the disposal of a journal for the r.lief of our starving and perishing soldiers in the Crimea. (Cheers.) Who, again, supported Lord Palnmerston in adema(ding an honourable peace, when Mr. Cobden and Mr. Giadstone and the Peace party would have betrayed the interests of the country to Russia ? Now, he was as much a friend of peace as any man. He was as little quarrelsomeasanyman,-much less so than M1r. Cobden; but he remembered an old Lstin proverb which said, if they wanted peace they must be ready for war, and so they must resist tke beginning of insults if they would not submit to be bu51ed. (Applause.) Let them tike the Chinese question. Thst was not a question of war or peace, but whether they wished English interests in China to be set at noughtand trampled upon by the most inaglent and faithless barbarians in t world. Let those who w,re in favour of Commissioner Ybh hold up their bands. (Not a single hand was raised for Yeh,) He would tell
them something about the Chiwlese. They were a v If singular peoplo a6nd had somne very curious habits. They 'wasre a petol the most uttewrly regardless of eutnta
e in the world. In China a man about ti
be tried for a capital offencoe might get another to stand the tria and have his head cut off instead. Askt any one engaged in the China trade, whether English, American, or Preonbe-ause the hissionauties, and al would answer that thir collisyon could not be helped. Did they suppose that one-third of the human race could continue until the end of the world for ever excluding commerce from themselves? Didl they suppose that any footing could ever he obtained in China without a few heartY knocks at the beginning? This Chinese difficulty would not lastsixmonths, and the wouldbe no war with China. It was not a i qain of a war, and the Nottingham men of allteentinathenwotldnought to back up Lord Paluerston in thi afair fo beore12 ouths were over they might have agtenottingha laCeersent into China. HesupportedL ords Paherestec to this occaston bemuse he thought that noble lordehad oto been fairly dealt by, for that noble lord was thehonly Ma . foundtogest tnes cntry cout dof the difficudty ofemtha the y war e (Applause) bUy hedidn pin his faith to Lor Pamertonin llreset.H i o consider him a

Aman o had been engaed wal his life in foreign polcy was not the individual uhner asi circunspancese to maket best Prime Minister; But the noble lord had done good service tohis country and deserved better treatment than to be censured for hacking uP his agents in China. (Cheers.) Be would now ay a fewv words wlth respect to his past conduct, as that had been alluded to. He had known Nottingham for some ma years, and though Mr. Ernest Jones had comes down to persuade them that they were all badly off, he must be allowed to say that they were not so very badly off. There never was A time when the trade of Nottingbam was so 1lours hing as it had been during the last ten years. How did Mr. rnest oneprc oose to remedy their grievances? fo tsettlin
them woud t waste lands of the couatry. Mr. onthey tell them that there was a certain namber of millions of ares of waste laud in the county, and he proposed to make the people better off by takng themfa frem the occupations they were accuistomed to and settling them on the bogs. rnorasses, and waste land of England. He had some experience of waste land. There were two classes of ren in every community, -one, and gonerally the wiser class, consisting of those who were willing to learn by the experience of others, and the other class choosing to buy their experience for themselves. It was a very amusing hut rather a dear process to bay one's o,wn experience, and most men repented of having done so. Now, he would givethem a little advice before they meddled withiana schbmes. There was a certain offce in Chancerylane where they right sew the original land sHeme of FeaTgus OConnor. It was a large volume, and containedthe names of Nottingham men, three-fourths of whom rould neitherreadnor write, and therefore affidxed theirmarkns. Every page, and almost every line, of that book recorded the loss of some poor man's savings in that most deplorably fatal scheme. He did not now thaerit was that landscheme which drove leargul O'Connor mad, or whether his madness m t pon the scheme, but the result wa the same; O'Connor endedhis life in a madhouse, and the unfortunate subscribers were reduced to ruxin. He (Mr. Walter) had some experience in waste land. He owned a good deal of waste land, and if any one wanted to sik his money in waste land he could accommodate him. but would hardly be acting the jpart of a friend in doing so. There was a custom in India, when an Indian Prince -wanted to ruin aPdangeros friend he adopted a curious process and made him a present of a white elephant, in order that the white elephant might eat a hole in his pobcet, and that was just what a p resent of waste land would do to a poor nMan. (Chers.) In the ancient history of the Trojan war it was related thai Ulysses, who was a man of the world and had great ex. perience, did not want to go to the fight, and in order to effect his object he pretended to be mad, ordered out a yoke of oxen, and tried to plough the ea" shore. That was waste land. (Cheers and laughter.) He did not tnow whether c r. Ernes Jones proposed to plough the sea he,he ut that gentleman's mode of dealing with waute ladu wudhe quito as unprofitable. (Cheers.) It was said byd some that if a man was not a great talker in Parliament he was of no use, but that was a great mistake. Parliament was a great school for the study of pptblic maen, and, though not a talker in Parliament, he (Mr. Walter) might become one, and, If not, might Imla his tim more profitably for his constituents. (enfear, helar.) But those Who were aware of his attendance in Par liament would tell them that be was one of the nost constant attendants in the House of Comons. (Appladuse.) The experience which he gained in Parliament was not lost to the country or to his constituents. (Applause.) He believed that rany of the Conservative party would supri Lord Palmerst'on becau they thought he had behavdim k a true John Bull under difficult circumstancds He also though that the Whig party would support that noble lord, who had promoted his (r. Walter's) late colleague, Mr. Strutt, to the House of Lords, and he could not have passed a greater compliment on the town of Nottingham. (Applause.) In his opinion the electors had made a very good choice i ettindg Mr Paget as their representative, for he undertioo wtheir local business thoroughy, and was a depresentative who would do them credit. His (Mr. Walter's) duty in Parliament was of a somewhat different kind from Mr. Paget's, but as long as they honoured him with their confidence isis imbe and energies were at their comamand. Whenever they grew tired of him, or found a man to suit them better, stil he should say lot them part good friends; hbut he would notewningly leave them in the hands of a new eacdidate, who, whateverhmiht be his ood intentions, was the advocate of medsre faught with danger to the State and certain ruin and misery to those who con. fided ingthem. (Cheers, with disapprobation from the Chartists.)
Mr. PAGET on presenting himself was received with mnuch hpplause. He said it was hut a few short months since they retarned him as their representative, and be was there to
them an account of his proceedings in the House of 5com1mons. He regretted the time was too short to enable him to show the full sense he entertained of the position in which he had been placed, but he had endeavoured not to lose his time, and had attended every sitting of the House with one exception, when, perhaps, they might think he was better employed in attending a deputation to a good Reformer to induce him to supplant an old Tory for North Nottingbanshire. The vtoe on the Chinese quesnton was what had brou gt them there on that occaion, and certainly it was the most difficult as it was the most important vote which farliament had had to cot-
ider for years. the entered on the examination of that question after receivinglrepresentations fromn the Peace Society, urging him in the stronges possible way to support Mr. Cobden's motion, and It was then is opinionl he should give his vote against the Government. He looked tMrough the boots, noting the things which made against the Government, but be found so much more which justified their conduct that he felt himself compelledon the thirdwday of the debate to make up his mind to support the Government. They were already aware he was in bavour of Parlimentary reform, and when he should see a measure which might be safely voted for to give the franchise to the now unrepresented millions, he should be most earnest in his support of it. The measure of Mr. Locks Ring went to enfranchise 300 000, and that division produced an imapresson upon the wOUSe
which they would have been delighted to witnbe. As he considered,. the borough members were infinitely superior to the county member, so he believed the introduction of 300,000 voters by Mr. Locke King's measure would have vr much improved the character of the county represednta tves. The young lords who went to the Opera and to balls, and just came into the House in time for a division, were not the men whom the counties wanted. Many important questions had come before the late Parliament. There was a measure respecting education, involving principles most difficult to decide upon, and he wished electors would turn their attention to those things, and give him their advice as to what course le should pursue. (Cheers.) They allfelt the necessitymfor increased education amonng the whole body of the population, and the difficulty was to ascertain in what way that should be carrieda out. If it was coinducted through the means of the funds of the State, then it would become a mere Gover-t Ment eagine, and they could easily imagine that no advantage would be derived from taking education out of the hands of the people and placing it in the hands of the Government. Some 40 or 50 yeara ago a mchine was m-ide-the beat machine at the time-for fabricating bolts for ships at Woolwich at the cost of 9d. each, but on one of the meon of the establihisent going to Birmingham the other day he found that the seine article coula be manufactured for three farthings. This wvas an illustration showing how apt matters were to remain stationary in the hands of the Goverument. (Cheers and laughter.) He had no doubt that if Governmient had the control of the education of the country they would establish the best system that could be establishedI now; lint then afterwards it would remain without improvement. (Appilause.) With regard to education, there miight be assistauca given to it from rates or by mosey from the State, bat stil there must be voluntary contributions from the people, because when the people gave their money they would also give their time anid attention t) the subject. (Cheers.) There were a great many objects besides education which requirzed the expenditure of money, and he didl not know how they could raise money without laying oni taxes. The difficuLlty was to spend and retrench at the same time. With respect to the army, there were parts of the mnilitary service which required y3ears of atten-
tion 0o bring to a proper state of perfection. He would keep them up ia a condition of efficiency, but, as for the rank and file of the army, he thought they need not have so many Englishmen wearing red coats at all times. (Cheers and laughter.) Whenever they were wanted they were always ready to come forward. and therefore he was inclined to reduce as much as possible the rank and file of the army. (Cheers, and cries of " Officers and aU.") There was only one other question on which he wished to say a few words, and that was the question of the settlement of the poor, and it was one which he knew, from having lived among them in a populous village, was of very great importance to the working men. No person would keep his horses two or three miles from where they worked. If they looked around they found the whole neighbourhood dotted over with large and small villagfe and they saw the men obliged to come to Nottingham to live and to go oat to the villages around to work, because in those villages comfortable houses were not built for them to live in. (Cries of " Shame.") Was that a good state of law which encouraged such a condition of things ? He found himself, in his efforts to improve the condition of people around him, met with objections, He wanted to build comfortable hoases for the people who worked on his farms; but if he proposed to do so his neighbours complained thathewasinjuring them by bringing a burden on them in consequence of his building those houses. (A cry of "Never mind.") Thus the building of those houses was left to tradesmen who must make the best interest for their money, and therefore they built houses with rooms as small as poRsible and with walls quite thin. He did not know any social reform which would operate so beneficiaUy for the people as an improvement with resect to this question of settlement. (Applause.) The sovernment had a measure, but the country gentlemen w oald not hear of it, and the Poor Lawr Minister
declared that his measure was not acceptable to the House. He (iMr. Paget) therefore conjured them to. F send to Parliament men to wvhom such a measure would be acceptable. If they again did him the bonour
to return him to the Hounse of Commons he would endea. Tour to do his duty as he had hitherto done it. (Cheerm)
Mr. EREUST JoNms next addressed the meeting, andnow the very parties who had before tried by their vociferations and uproar to deprive Mr. Walter of a hearieg were charmed to silence and gave a most patient attention to the harangue of their favourite orator, occasionallycheering him with all the might of their lungs. He said that three years ago they had done him the honour without solicitation to propose him as a candidate, and that invitation, givenand accepted, had been repeated on a subsequent occasion. A vacancy occurred, and Mr. Paget and himself had put up for it, but he immediately gave way to Mr. Paget, who was a townsman of, theirs, as he t ought out of two members ono should be their fellow-townsman. He was pledged to conteat the borough whenever a general election occurred, and to remain in the field and to poll to the last man. (Cheers.) Mr. Walter was part proprietor of a London paper, and so also was he (Mr. Jones), consequently they both belonged to London and to the press, and were on an equality in that respect. Mr. Walter claimed credit for a part taken by 2h6 Times in the Crimean war, but he recollected that it was The Times which, by its writings, caused the British army to be engulfed in the Crimea, instead of alloving it to remain to oppose the plans of Russia in the neighbourhood of the Danube. What was it that urged The Times to expose the mismanagsement of the army? It was the voice of the people. After making some further allusions to Mr. Walter in connexion with The Times, he proceeded to say he would refer to some of the questions of the day. Mr. Walter had described him as bemg in favour of relieving the distresses of the poor by takig them from their occupations and locating them on bogs Ae was not in favour of tbat, but he was in favour of giving employment to those who could find none by locating them, not on bogs or bad land, but on good land.
e did not desire anycompulsory legislation on the subiect; al that he wanted was that free trade should be carried out in land and in laud proprietorship. (Cheers.) One of the barriers that stood in the way of increased production and cheap food was the law of primogeniture, which gave to the eldest son aU the land of the father, and made the rest of the family beggars. Administrative reform was impossible as loug as the law of settlement and of primogeniture remuaned as at present, because the younger sons of the aristocracy had nothing to live upon but the public purse. The alteration of the law of prinuogeniture was the first step to be taken toplace the people ontheland, and was itnotajust and reasonable measure? (Applawse.) He was an advocato of the People's Charter in its entirety, and he thought that those who taUled about the danger of smashing the delicate machine of the British constitution were the most likely men to help to smash it. Although he declared hinself an advocate for the Charter in its entirety, he would at the same time be ready to vote for any progressive and rational measure of reform. Did they think he would have voted against Mr. Locke King's motion, against the equalization of electoral districts, against the ballot, or against Sir J. Walmasley's motion for inquiring into the franchise? He said to the advocates of moderate reform that the -way to get those instalments which they desired was not to return men to Parliament who would not go for any instalment, but to send those who would vote for an instalment, because they were ready to vote for a still greatermeasure. He denied that Mr. Walter had realized the professions he made in 1852 to advocate and support measures of reform and improvements in the British constitution. What chance was there that Mr. Walter would vote to enfranchise the unenfranchised, when he actually disfranchised the very men whom he vas sent to represent in Parliament, for during the last session he was absent from his duties 164 nichts, and voted contrary to Mr. Paget on eight occasions? They wanted a representative of a different kind, and if Mr. Walter would gve a vote to every man who couald read and write, why did he not support Air. Locke King's motion and Mfr. Berkeley's motion for the ballot as well as every measure for the extension of the suffrage ? (Cheers.) There was one vote of Mr. Walter to which special attention bad been drawnthat relating to the Chinese question; but he thought, instead of giving that vote, it would have been better had Mr. Walter absented himself from the House 165 nights instead of 164. He was no " peace-at-any-price" man, but yet he was a man in favouar of peace, and he believed the Chinese warwasagreat crime, and not necessary ia any way. (Hisses and cheers.) Mr. Walter had told them he considered the war necessary to protect the interests of the
English in China; bat was war necessary for that purpose I (Cries of "Yes," aiid " No.") Englishmen were in no danger in every other town on the seaboard of China bat Canton, showing that it was the English who aggravated the Chinese and and not the Chinese the English. (Loud cries of " No.") Let him draw their attention to the ruinous consequences the Chinese war would have on their trade in 3ottingham. China was an empire with about 300,000,000 of inhabitants, and from it came the chief amount of the silk employed in this coantry; and they knew of how much consequence that article was to the trade of Nottingham. They were plunged in a war with a country that produced the article which kept factories and warehouses of that town in a state of comparative prosperity. After adverting to the circumstances connected with the transactions in China, he declared himself to be an advocate for freedom in religion, and he thought that to compel people to support a church to which they did not belong was unjust in principle, unsound in practioe, and tended materially to bring religion into discredit. He therefore was in favour of a separation of church and State and repeal of church-rates, but he was not in favour of touching the private property of the church. He did not want to rob the church, but, on the other hand, the church should not be empowered to rob him. (Applause.) The next great question was tho income-tax, which bore most unevenly upon different classes of the community. It had been said the working classes had escaped the incometax, but never was there a greater fallacy. No man in the country, except the pauper in the workhouse, escaped the effects of that tax. Be was in favour of a modified, reduoed, and graduated scale of income-tax, so that the great aristocrats of the country should pay as much inproportionasthe small shopkeeper and tradesman. Mr. Jones concluded by observing that he thought the contest was between himself and Mr. Walter, and by offering a reward of 50M. to any person who would being evidence of any case of bribery during the election.
Mr. MARsioTr, an elector, asked Mr. Paget whether he would vote for the abolition of church-rates.
Mr. PAGET replied that this was a question which had divided large towns, and the rates, when opposed, were almost always opposed with success. He was confident that by a better management of the church property the fabric of the church might be maintained. (Applause.)
Mr. MARPiOTr inquired whether Mr. Walter would vote in the same way ?
Mr. WALTER said he had always voted in the same way (loud cheers), and he took that opportunity of saying that he and his family had built and supported a church, and maintained a clergyman at their own expense. (Cheers.) He was not going to ask the privilege of a reply, but Mr. Jones had not only misrepresented his opinions, but he had made a misrepresentation of fact in stating that he (Mr. Walter) was absent from Parliament 164 nights last session. That was absolutely untrue (cheers), for he had attended the House of Commons almost every night last session. (Renewed cheers.)
Mr. E. JoxEs.-I said Mr. Walter was absent from 164 divisions. (Cries of " No, no; you said nights.") Well, then, if I said nights I meant divisions. (A cry, "You can say anything.")
A show of hands was then called for in favour of the several candidates, and it was declared by the sheriff, as we have previously stated, to be in favour of Mr. Paget and MIr. E. Jones, whereupon a poll was immediately demanded on behalf of 3ir. Walter, and the polling was fixed to commence at 8 o'clock this morning.
With a vote of thanks to the sheriff, moved by Mr. Paget and seconded by Mr. Walter, the proceedings termninated.
NOTTINGHAMSWIRE (NORTH).
Mr. J. E. D&NCsoy;, in a speech to the elec'ors of the division, said, that he had not come forward until he had been waited upon by two deputations requesting him to do so. He could not, therefore, be charged with thrusting himself into the representation. The Chinese question was not so much a question of law as of common sense, and by that test the electors should form their verdict. After alluding to one or two minor topics he concluded by saying, if they elected him he should consider himself at the service of all his consti.nents, however much they might differ from him in political opinion.
Lord R. CLINTON said, that his former predictions as to the benefits of free trade in stimulating agriculture and extending commerce had been happily fulilled. In voting against the Government on the China question he wished it to be distinctly understood he had simply intended a condemnr.tion of Her Majesty's agents at Hongkong, and not a vote of censure on Her Majesty's Ministers at home and such he considered was the gist of Mr. Cobden's motion.
It was surmised that Lord H. Bentinck would, after all, be nominated by some of his more enthusiastic supporters.
MANCHESTER.
The adjourned meeaing of Messs. Gibson and Bright's supporters took place on Wednesday evening in the Free Trade-halL It was mAuch more crowded even than on the
previous occasion, there being probably 7,000 persons in the building, packed close, and nearly all standing, while about 1,000 more, being unable to gain admittance, held an openair meeting of their own in an adjoining street. It had been announced that Mr. Gibson and Mr. Cobden wouldaddress the assemblage, but the expectation of hearing the last-named gentleman was doomed to a painful disappointment.
Mr. GzOcGE WILSOy, the chairman, who rose amid prolonged cheering, said it was his painful duty to inform the meeting that their friend Mr. Cobden, who never during seven years, so far as he could recoUect, failed to attend on any occasion when he was announced to speak, had arrived in hMaucheiter that evening, exhausted with the efforts he had made during the last seven or eight days, and was now suffering the most intense afflietion of the brain in consequence, as his friends believed, of his exertions on behalf of the people of this country. (Loud cries of " Hear, hear," and cbeers.) On Monday week Mr. Cobden addressed a great maeeting in London, the next night le spoke in Salford, and the next at the great meeting held in this hall, since which, day by day, he had been addressing in the open market-place of Huddersfield the electors and nonelectors of that town. It woould be readily conceived hov. in the midst of the excitement of a struggle like this, these things must tel upon a man; and he must therefore claim the kindly consideration of the meeting in Mr. Cobden's absence. (Hear.) He (the chairman) feared that their best men were being exhausted in this great struggle. (Hear, hear.) He should not like to see Mr. Cobden brought there for the
ose of exbantiug himself as bMr. Bright had exhausted imself in their cause. (Hear, hear.) England could not afford to lose the services of those great nuen (hear, hear); and if for the present we were deprived of them, he felt persaaded that the great and mannly determmua#on of Englishmoen would stand by those men (mucch confosion)-those men of the 'people-and that we should see
then 5o ntine among us in the proud poition of the great leaders of progress in the cause of and for the people of England IPenewed confusion at the lowar end of the room; durng which the chairman begged that no attempt would be made to turn out or molest any man ) Since they last met they had beon engaged in preparation for the general election, and they had seen their opponents resort to practices which on all former occasions had met, and he believed would now meet, the condemnation of every man in Manchester. They (the chairman and his friends) fought this battle on principle, and, whether they were destined to stand or fall in this great struggle, the people of England should at least say that there were still in England men faithful to their principles. (Applause.) He was no' going to repudiate his connexion with the League. As to the charge that the late members had not attended to their local duties, he could say that during the last year more than 500 honest working men had applied to him to Fend communications on business to those gentlemen; and he hbd never heard a single complaint from any ono of the 500 of inattention to their wants. (Loud cheers.) All the private business of Manchester in connexion with Parlia. ment was not concentrated in the Town-hall, as would be plinly seen if the correspondence of the late members with those who did not form deputations could be produced. He knew that the Government had concentrated all their energies to crush the men of Manchester, and they accepted the challenge. (Great cheering.)
The Right Hon. T. M3 Grisox was received with the most enthusiastic and long-continued cheering. His speech was of considerable length, but princpaly a repetition of hisrecentarguments, or dealing with the local circumstances of the election. He said he had been unable to ascertain the political opinions of M1r. Turner, but that gentlemnau was represented to him as a political Marplot; certainly as one who had never helped forward the chariot of progress. Was such a man fitted to represent the activemirded, progressive constituency of Manchesterl ("No, no !') If Sir John Potter was, as be professed to be, a Liberal, why did he try to turn out a Liberal whose opinions hesaid he could endorse? When Lord Palmerston took credit for the extraordinary vigour of himself and his Administration in bringing about a glorious peace he forgot that there was not a single success to the British arms after he was placed at the head of affairs. The only change for the better after his Lordship's assumption of power was that the soldiers were better provided with food and clothing but Lord Panmure distinctly avowed that the plans, in that respect, of the Duke of Newcastle were carried out. (Hear.) When Lord Palmerston called the Liberal members together at his houee the only inducement he held out for them to vote with him was the "extraordinary luck" ofthe Government. Certainly it was Iremarkably lucky in getting credit that fairly belonged to others He did not see much yolitical difference between Lord Derby and Lord Palmerston. Lord Derby said to Lord Palmerston, "Y ou set yourself up as head of the Liberal party, but you are not a Iiberal ;" and Lord Palmerston rephed, "No more are you." (Laughter and loud cheers.) As to the Canton question, it was absurd to talk of faction. In sending out Lord Elgin the Government had only followed Mr. Cobden's advice, and the cry for increased protection to lives and property in China was pointed out by Mr. Cobden as necessary, and as a direct result of the hostilities that had been commenced witbout the sanction of Parliament. The Government intended to make the late war a pretext for a permanent addition to the military establishment, and if successive augmentations were to be made after every war this country would in time have an overpowering military force, which might endanger the cvil liberties of the people. The Police Bill as first proposed, was still in a pigeon-hole at the Home-office, and if the electors did not send men to Parliament who would resist this attempt on their hberties, they would find that the opportunity would be sei7ed by the Government some day when they thought the House was in the humour, and, in spite of the people, this obnoxious measure woulid be carried. ( ar, hear.) Perbaps the meeting was not aware that the present Prime Minister was most popular among the county members Lord Palmerston knew how to tickle them, and he (1r. Gioson) had repeatedly noticed that when his Lordship was taking a ride on the British lion he threw out some complimentary zemark about the yeomanry force or the militia, of which the country gentlemen were so proud; and so, when they left the House, the county members said to one another, " Well, after all, old Palmerston is a true Conservative, and we sbeant mend matters by cbanging him for Derby." (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) He stated deliberately that
e (Mr. Gibson) knew thin to be the case; and would the electors send men to Parliament whose business it would be to support a Minister of that sort ? (' No, no!") The letter to foreigners-from Sir George Grey appeared to him (Mr. Gibson) to be tinged with the same policy that dictated the old Alien BiU1,-to make foreigners uneasy and uncomfortable in this country; and, as he had told several German gentlemen, if he was again returned to Parliament, as he believed that letter was not in accordance with the laws, he should bring the subject under the consideration of the House. (Hear, hear.) He had never flinched from doing his duty upon the questions of the extension of the franchise, the redistribution of political power, shortening the duration of Parliaments, and civil and religious liberty. If these were, as he believed, the principles of the reform party of Manchester, he asked emphatically if the case of the old members was not a good one (hear, hear), and whether the ,electors would not, by the decon they would give on Saturday, again return those members to Parliament by a triumphant majority? (Prolonged cheering.)
lr. J. Sirpsox moved, and Mfr. H. Rxwsox seconded, a vote of confidence in Messra. Gibson and Bright, which was carried all but unanimously, with great cheering.
The meeting was afterwards addressed by the Pev. Dr. M'KERP.ow and the Rev. Dr. HALLEY, who approved Mr. Cobden's motion and advocated the return of the late members for M1anchester; and the proceedings terminated with three cheers for the Queen and three for Gibson and Brzight.
The meeting outside the haU had meanwvhile passed a vote of confidence in Messrs. Gibson ard Bright, and then adjourned till last evening, in Stevenson-square.
BATE.
The nomination took place yesterday morning in the Orange-grove. The candidates, Mr. Tite and Sir A. H. Elton (Liberals), and hr. A. E. Way (Liberal-Conservative), accompanied by their friends, arrived at the hustings shortly before 11 o'clock, and were received with cheers and hisses from their respective cartisans
The AYor (Mr. P Cook) officiated as returning officer and after the usual preliminaries addressed the meeting, requesting a patient hearing for all the candidates, and vindicated himself from a charge of partiality preferred against bim by Mr. Way for maling proclamation of the writ on SLnday last.
Mr. Alderman HUiTr proposed and Mr. W, T. BLAIR (magistrate) seconded the nomination of Mr. Tite.
Mr. Alderman Nor..sia proposed and Dr. FiLCOXXR seconded the nomination of Sir A. HL Elton.
Captain DOLPysIl proposed and Mr. Sxim (chymist) seconded the nomination of Mr. Arthur Edwin Way, of Ashton Lodge, Somerset.
Mr. TiTE addressed the electors, appealing to the votes he had gOven in Parliament in confirmation of the declaration in his address that he had supported all questions on administrative reform, had voted for the ballot and the extension of the franchise, and against the Regium Donum and the minister's money, and for Mr. Miali's motion for an inquiry into the state of the Irish church. The hon. candidate highly eulogized Lord Palmerston for his recent ad-
le appointments to the episcopal bench, and declared hs intention of giving the present 'Ministry his cordial support. Referring to his opponent, Mr. Way, he severely criticized the principles which he had avowed, and declared that he could not understand the position of any man who called himself a Liberal-Conseryative. Would he, if returned to the Bouse of Commons, sit behind John Arthur Roebuck, the former member for Bath, or go on the other side to sit behind Disraeli? If he took the former course, what would the Tories say, who now brought him forward? In conclusion, Mr. Tite impressed upon his gupporters the necessity of a firm union among themselves, and declared his strong conviction that if they continued united he should be placed at the head of the polL
Sir A. H. ELTON said that a Government was wanted which would carry out Liberal principles, improve the constitution, and maintain England in the state of glory to which she had attained. He was an advocate for vote by ballot, and for the extension of the suffrage, and for the application of something like an education test to the emercise of the franchise, by giving it to professional men, clergymen, barristers, surgeons, and artists, though they might be only lodgers, and not occupiers of houses. He would have the smaller boroughs assimilated, and their number of members transferred to populous counties and cities, or their boundaries extended. e was friendly to the present system of Government aid for education, and was opposed to any
merely secular system of instruction. He also advocated I cheap law, and legal reform generally. H{e was notj ashamed of the old watchwords of the Whiga, "Peace, retrenchment, and reform," but wfas ready to advocate them, if returned to the Hlouse of Commons.
3r. WAY, who, on the whole, obtained a very fair hearing, replied to the observations made respecting him by the Mayor, and complained that the effect of the proclamation of the writ on Sunday had been to deprive him, the last candidate in the field, of two days' canvassing. He defined his designation as a Liberal-Conservative to be a supporter of the fundamental principles laid down at the glorious Revolution of 16Sb,_a limited monarchy, an hereditsrv Uouse
of ['ers, a free House of Commons, an established Protestant Church, civil and reli-ous liberty, equal lavs and equal justice for every indivdoal of the realm of England. (Cheers.) On the otherhand,hewouldasupport all judicious and well-considered measures of reform. He was favourable to a revision of the law and ecclesiastical courts, opposed to the ballot and any present extension of the suffrage, willing to assist in an equitable adjustment of the church-rate question, and desirous of the utmost economy in the plic expenditure consistent vwith the efficiency of the public service. If returned, he should givo
the Government of Lord Palmerston an honest and independent support.
The show of hands was Isrgely in favour of Mr. Tite and Sir A. W. Elton. A poll was demanded on behealf of Mr. Way, which was fixed to take place to-day (Friday).
Captain SconELI, one of the late ienubers for the city, in a few vords took his farewell of hiq constitnents, and defended the v.te which he gave in reference to:he Chinese question.
Sir A. ELTON moved, and 3rr. WAY seconded, a vote of thanks to the Mayor, which concluded the proceedings.
BEDFORD BORiOUJGH.
The nomination took place yesterday npon St. Peter'sgreen, and the proceedings were conducted in a most primitive stjle. Eight waggons were placed so as to forns a square, and they were occupied by the returning offlcer, the offcals, cancidates, and speakers. The people stood on the turf mn the space betseen the waggons. Mr. Kilpin, the Mayor, presided.
Tr. W. *LrMlS,ss, a magistrate, pDnposed lEr. Samuel Whitbread,and Mtr. Aldermlan H1GGS seconded ;he nomi-
Captain LExcH proposed, and Captain NEwr.AN. seconded, Captain W. Stuart, the Conservative candidate.
Mr. Ald.rman HuisT proposed, and Ur. T, RosE
*rry with It, before they approved of a masure. Now, what osTt of votes would th at measure have given in counties? They had beard in Halifax of what was called -cow-house voters? ("H ear, hear," and laughter.) Did they know what a cow-houte vote meant? ("Yes, yes.') Did they know how those who created theminauenced those who received the vote. Did they ever know a iAberal vote in that borough ori nating out of a cowhouse qualification? (lear, hexr.) He was told that there would proba6bly be at the ensuing election something like 70 votes which might be called .o3w-house votes. These were not, be it remembered, the votes of intelligent and indepeDdent householders; but they were persons entirely dependent upon those who conferred the franehise upon them; and they were led to the poll-booth to swamp the votes of the independent electors. (Cheers.) Was that a class of voters they would wish to see introduced? (Cries of "No no," ' Tho ballot -land loud cheers) Aye, butthe ballot would not cure that. Did they suppose that Major Edwards's butler, or footman, or gardener would be induced by the ballot to vote against their employer who gave them the franchise. (Hear, hear.) Depend upon it the gentlemen who made these votes would take care to select men upon whom they could depend, and thus swamp the independent electors. (Applause, and "Doa't the Whi
do it?") No. (Applause.) Let them,show him a W g cow-house voter m that borough. (Loud cheers) He would meet them fuly, freely, fairly, openly upon that guestion; and if there were any let them now declare it.
ow, let them look to the effect of the 10W. franchise in counties. Why, they could by that franchise establish tens and hundreds of votes which would be used just as the landlords might direct. (Hear, hear.) Take the 101 householders of Doncaster, for example. Two-thirds of them, he would Assume, were of Uberal opinions, and one-third were Conservatives. Suppose the Tory landlords were to make cow-house votes; he could place a stable in one field, a cow-house in another, a pig-sty in another, and so on round his estate. One field he could apportion to his butler, a second to his footman, a third to his gardener, and so on through all his sevants and Iabourers, and swamp the independent electors of the whole neighbourhood. (Loud applanse.) Desirous as they were to extend the franchise, Government oould not consent to a measure liko this with. out some protection against this system of manufacturing votes and converting counties into close boroughs in the hands of the lndlords. (Applause.) He did not say that they could not devise means of guarding against this abuse; but he wished them distinctly to understand that the Government of Lord Palmerston, in opposing Mr. Locke King'e motion, did not object to an ex. tension of the franchise. (Hear, hear.) The members of that Government had introduced two Reform Bills, in both of which they provided for an extension of the suffrage; but he warned them not to be led away by the delusion that every extension of the franchise was an unmi-xed good. (Hear, hear.) The Reformers of this country had done aUl they could to destroy aristocratic influence in elections, and don't let them now go back and restore that evil infdnence by putting Into the hands of the aristocracy the power to convert counties Into close boroughs. That was the reason why Government opposed Mr. Locke King's Bil in the last session-not because they were opposed to an extensioa of the county franchise, but becaLue they believod it would tend to swamp the independent roters of counties by creating fictitious voters not competent to form independent opinions, or to Act upon them if they had any. (Applause.)
Mr. F. CRosSrEY, who was received with reiterated cheers, then addressed the meeting.
Several 9uestiocs having beenanswered, thanks were given to the chairman andto thetwo candidates for their past services, and the proceedings terminated.
WINDSOR.
The nomination of candidates for this borough took place yesterday. On all previous occasions, such has been the strong and excited feeling among the electors that the proceedings of nomination have been conducted in the open market, beneath the Town-hall; but, as the present contest appears to be carried on in a more friendly and quiet spirit by the two parties, the Mayor (Mr. G. Pearl) determined u nn opening the haU on this occasion, and the demeanour or the crowd most conclusively demonstrated that his worshin was not mistaken in the confidence he placed in the
e writ was read by Mr. DarviU, the town clerk, and the Mayor having taken the usual oath, caUed upon any of the electors to propose candidates.
MIr. J. CLODI, wine merchant, proposed, and htr. H&Rnrs seconded, that Mr. Charles William Grenfell was a fit and pror person to represent the borough in Parliament.
. J. T. BEDBoloUoGr, a magistrate of the borough, proposed Mr. Samson Ricardo as a candidate, and Mr. MimTON seconded the nomination.
Captain BULxnLY proposed as a candidate Mr. William Vansittare, and Dr. DUNr-P seconded the nomination.
Mr. GRrNFELL rose, and was received with enthusiastic cheers. He said he appeared before them as a candidate for their suffrages at the approaching election. He asked it in the remembrance ofmany Acts of kindness received at thoir hands, and he did so with the most perfect confidenco that he should obtain it. But he did not rely upon acts of kindness on their part. EHe asked them to look at acts he had done andvotes he had given in Parliament since he had been fivo years their representative, and since he had spent ten years of his life in the House of Commons. (Cheers.) His principles wore sufficiently known to that constituency and to the country. He was not, nor had he ever been, for half-and-half measures. (Cheers.) He should not have appeared before them then, if he thought tbat on any occasion in Parliament he had forsaken those Liberal principles upon which he first obtained their suffrages. From the year 1847, when he first had the honour of a sat in Parliament, all measures that had for their object progressive reform, a gradual extension of the suffrage, and the advancement and enlightenment of the country at large, he had always supportod. (Cheers.) He did not know of but one occasion during the whole 10 years in which he sat in Parliament on which he was absent at a division where the measuro was known to affect the popular interests of the people of this country. (Cheers.
He assured themthat he was a cordial but independent supporter of Lord Palmerston, and he should continue to pursue the same course of conduct as hitherto if he succeeeed in obtaining the suffrages of the electors. (Cheers.)
Mr. RrscAno next addressed the meeting, but very briefly. Elo said that duing the two years lie represented this borough in Parliament ie had shown himse. to be an uncompromising Liberal. He was not a Liberal-Conservative. (Laughter.) He did not understand thatapplication It was, undoubtedly, a very convenient appellation to carry about in a canvass. It waswell tohavetwo sidestothe banner, to put "Iaberal" on one side and " Conservative " on the other; to depict on one side "Progress of Reform, the People, and Success to Lord Palmerston," and on the other, "I o Reform, the wisdom of our ancestors, and Lord Derby for ever." (Laughterand cheers.) The bon. gentleman who opposed him and Mr. GrenfeU had something of this course of action about him. He could safely venture to affirm that the Liberal feeling predominated with the Minilstcrs at the present time, and if the Government were weU supported by the conntry in the return of an increased numnber of Liberals, he had no doubt Lord Ealmerston would introduce measures of a liberal character, which would tend to benefit the great masses of the population. (Cheers.) As the borongh of Windsor was one o the fit called upon to make an election, he trusted that it would not go forth that this district, in the very precincts of the Court, should be the first to chase away one of the Liberalmembers and let in a Conservative, who would not be a cordial supporter of Lord Palnerston and his Government. (Loud cheers.)
r. VAN-ArBT was loudly cheered. He had been told that he was a novice and inexperienced * he could assure themn, however thatin al6 days' canvass he had learnta thing or two. (Loua laughter and applause.) He had some claim upon the borongh, inasmuch as within a few miles of it he was born, bred, and educated. At an early age he proceeded to serve his country in foreign parts. He spent the best of his days there; he rose to the highest judicial and magisterial departments, and there. fore he had seen active service, and had a knowledge of character. (Applause.) He was now desirous of serving his country m another way-namely, by being returned to represent them. (Loud applause and disapprobation.) With regard to the Chinawar, now that the country was involved in i,e and from what he knew personally of the character of those people, itmust be vigorously and promptly conducted. The more vigorously and promptly it was conducted the quicker should we have an honourable and glo. rious peace. (Applause.) Let them not be satisfied with seeing the flag or Britain waving upon that rock of Hong. kon=, but let it wave at Canton itself. (Loud applause.) With reference to the domestic policy of the country, he told them honestly he was prepared to uphold our constitutien, our free institutions, and the Protestant church. (Applause.) He would advocate aU such measures of progressive reform as were suitable to the wants of the age and wbhilh were iR correspondence with the spread of education and intelligence among the people. (Applause.) H should devote the strictest possible attention to the expenditure of the country, and strongly advocate reduced expenditure and a total extinction of the income-tax. Loud *pplase.) He would aLso endeavour, as far as in im lay, to promote the social oondition of the people, whether it was by stimulating them by emigration or advancing among them greater measures of education. (Applause.) It had been stated hoe was a strong supporter of Lord Palinerston. If he was returned,he was prepared to give a general, but an honest and independent uepport to that Minister, (Applause.) He was no truckler, no timeserver; he wasnominee of neither club nor party, but he
appeared among them as a thoroughly independent man. (Lond applause.) In his opinion, within three or four years there would be another election, and then, if they thought proper to elect him now, they would see how far he had carried out the promises he had made to them. (Loud applause.)
The Mayor then took a show of hands, and declared it to be in favour of Mr. Grenfell and Mr. Vansittart.
A pol was demanded by Mr. Bedborough on behalf of
Mr. Ricardo.
A close contest is antielDated.
HERTFORD.
The nomination of the candidates forthe borough of Hertford took place yesterday.
The proceedings commenced at 11 o'clock, and, the writ havig been read and the other formalities gone through, MIr. B. D. RAYMEir, the mayor of Hertford stood forward
and commenced the business of the election by calling uponL
the electors to propose candidates to represent them in A?rliament.
Mr. J. J. GRsi'PP first proposed the Righlt Hon. W. F. Cowperfyreat cheering), and Mr. W.FPOLLAD econded the nominaton.
Mr. Y. CRAWLEY proposed Mr. T. Chambers, and Mr. Alderman YoUIG econded the nomination.
Mr. J. LAURE:NCE then proposed Sir 1I. Parquhar, whose nomination was seconded by MIr. H. CoLxmiA.
Mr. Cownnrz then stood forward to address the electors. He said that only two months ago he had stood before them in a similar position to that be now occupied, and they would remember that ae that time the opoonents of the Government were endeavouring to maie the people beleve that the Government intended unfairly to tske advantae of the wording of the statute to kee enther wan n -tax for anhother yer, but he toln them at the time that they had no suchL Int4ation. and
the result had verified what hIe then stated. The GoVieinmnent of Lord Paltnerston was most anxious ths rednoe the burdens of the people and to leseen the erpenditure of the
country in every respect ma far sa3 uas donsistent with its honour and safety. They had already done a great'deal in that direction, and they were prepared to do much mn6re if the Parlianent had not been so suddenly broueht to an end by the proceedings of their opponent (Hear.) What, then, was the cause of this step beimg takon7 A haugty and despotic barbarian bhd dared to inflict an insult upon the British flag which no nation jealotts of its bonour could for a moment think of submitting to, and he bad received the chastisement he deserred; but the proceeding appeared to have come very opportunely for the purposes of the opponents of the Government. They had moked round them at home, but could find nothing that would answer tbeir purpose. First they made it a gromd of complaint that the incomne*tax was not to be taken off, and when they found there was no foundation for this suggestion, they tauned round and said that too great reductions had been made, and that the country would be bankrupt. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) Finding that neither of these arguments irevaled, and that the Honse of Commons by a maiority oF 80 sactioned the financia propositionsof the Government, they looked for some other question uPon which they might hope to turn out the Government, and they found it in this p- ceeding at Canton By a most extraordinary coalition a majority was obtained against the Government, thereby virtually declaring that the barbarian Yeh Was right, and he supposed if Lord Derby came into power n apokgy would be made to him for the proceedings that had been taken by our navy for the honour of Old England, and for proclaiming by the mouth of the cannon that they would not allow their country to be insulted by any barbarian, however great he might be. (Cheers.) Now that the country happily enjoyed the blessings of peace, the Government s prepared to carry outthose measures of reform that were required, and he would ask those who desired the progression of Liberal principles to consider whether they were more likely to obtain thena from the Government of Lord Derby than from that of Lord Palmerston. (Hear, hear.) Lord Palmerston had accepted offiae at a period when they were engaged in an European war, and under very discoragi circaumstances, when no other statesman would undertake the task, and by his energy and determination he had brought t4e vessel of the State safe into port, and he could rot believe that the people would desert bim now. (Heai.) He could only say that if they did, and if they gave his opponents a majority, it would cause great
elight in Rassia, great delight in every despotic Court in Europe, and would give especial delight to Commissioner Yeh and his despotic, throat-cutting barbarians. (Hear, hear.) He said, in concluding, that he believed the electors of Hertford would certainly not tako this course, and that they would return their two old members and reject the candidate who would oppose the Government.
Mr. T. CR5AMS then stood forward to address the electors, but he was received -with considerable disapprobation, and soine time elapsed before le coald be heard. He commenced by observing that he did not complain of the electors expressing their feelings, although they might ba wnfavourable to hun, andl they had a perfect right to do so. (A cry of to Tur him out.') Some one said, " Turn him out." Well, they might do so if they pleased, and he would not complain, but he hoped that in fairness and candoar theywould at all events hear him before theydid so. (" Hear ancla laugh.) Ten years ago he first camneforward to solicit their sauffraNes, and for five years he had had the honour of being their representative, and he now stood before them again to ask their support and he asked them to act upon their candid and upright judgment in deciding the question whether he ought to be returned as their representative, and if such decision was favourable to him, or whether it would consign binm to the shades of private life, he should be satisfied. Duing the Administration of Lord Palnmerston a safe and honourable peace had been obtained, and although at the commencement of the war all the administrative departments of the State appeared to have broL-en down ia the most melancholy manaer, so much so that the voice of everyone was lifted up in indignation and disgust at their proceedings, yet the insment the House of Commons expressed its opinions upon these matters a great change took place, and the army,which had before been in the most depressed and miserable condition, was speedily raised to the state of the utmosb ehffciency; and it appeared to him that the House of Commo s on this question entirely reflected the feeling of the peop e of England. He then proceeded to state that he supported the Government of Lord Palmerston because he believed he would bring forward Liberal measures and he asked them whether they thought they were likely to get any reform from a Government such as would be formed by LordDerby or Mr. Disraeli. If they wanted a Government that would support the honour of the country, did they think, after the recent debate, that they would effect that object by supporting Lord Derby? He would not take an unfair advantage of his lordship, however, and he was bound to express an opinion that if he had been in office he would have acted on the Chinese question exactly as Lord Palmerston had done. (Hear, hear,) If it were so, then he could not help considering that his vote was a factious vote, and that it was ungenerous to the Government and unjast to the country to give such a vote, (Hear.) Mr. Chambers next proceeded to refer to the proceedings he had taken in connexion with the Nunneries Bill, and he said he had done all be could to pass that measure, because ho considered that at present the young women of this country who entered such establishments were virtuaUl
placed out of the protection of the law, and he said that ii ho was re-eleoted it was his intention to introduce another measure upon tho subject, and he believed he should make out a mach stronger case for its adoption than he did before. He then stated that ia all his Parliamentary course he had acted from a conscientious desire to advance the interests of his constituents and the country at large. and, although they might undoubtedly deprive him of tbe high honour to vwhich;he now aspired-he did not believe they would do so, but if they should he should ever foet grateful for the honour they had formerly conferred on him and for the kindness he had on so many occasions received at their hands.
Sir M. FARQUHAx next stood forward and was received with loud cheers. He said that he most cordially thanked the electors for the kindness he had received from them during his canvass and for the promises of support that he had received. They all k-new him as a neighbour-he was constantly mixing with them, and they were aware that 10 years ago he came forward as a candidate to represent them in Parliament, and he was delighted to find that they had not forgotten him. (Cheers.) H¢ could assure them that if he had consulted his own personal convenience he should not have had the honour of addressing them on the present occasion. He had no desire to plunge again into polities, but he had received such pressing solicitations that he could not resist coming forward as their representative. ("No, no ?I anda lau4h.) It was a slip of tha tongue to say their representative at that momenl* but he regarded it an a goodomen. He came forward solely at the request of the electors, and he would repeat the observation that was made by his hon. friend, Mr. Cotwper, when he first came forward, that it was his intenton to open the borough, and give the electors an opportunity of asserting thelr sndependence. He was surprised that any gentleman should have ventured to make the assertion that he ws merely the nominee of Lord Salisbury. He was no man's nominee, nor had he seen Lord Salisbury since last June or July. He had always told them that he would not ptedge himself to any particular course, but would go into Parliament thoroughly independent. This determination was confirmed by what had taken place between the electors and one of their late honourable candidates, Mr. Chambers. They had on several occasions expressed their dissatisfaction at the conduct of that gentleman, and what was the reason? Why, because in 1852 he had made a flourish of pledges which his supporters thoaght he had not carried out. (ear, hear.) If there was any dis& tinction between their two late hon. members, it appeared to him that Mr. Chambers was the greater Radical of the two, and yet upon Mr. Locke King's motion for extending the county franchise he was found in the majority of 31, 21 of whom were placemen that supported the Governnent in opposing that motion. (Hear, hear.) He then said that nothing bat the determined coalition that existed between hlr. Cowper and Mr. Chambers could prevent him from being returned, and that if the contest had merely been between him and Mr. Chambers thero would be no doubt of the result; and heurged the electors not to assist ia the endeavour that would be made to carry MIr. Chambers into Parlianment upon the shoulders of his colleague. He would support every well-considered and rational measare of reform, and, although his opponents preferred tolaugh at hisaddress and at his coming forward as a Liberal Conservative, they must have supposed that he had been asleep for the last 10 years if he had asked for the sufra ges of the electors upon any other principles than those he had avowed in his address. (Cheers.) With regard to the Chinese question it appeared to him that a most gross insult had been offered tothe British flag, and that the British authorities had done no more than their duty in resenting it, and although it might have been dlsagreeable to his party, upon that ques. tion he should certainly have supported Lord Palmerston. (Cheers.) He at the same time, however, thought that at the onset of the debate Lord Palmerston ought to have informed the House that he had sent out so able a diplomatist as Lord Elgin, with full powers to set"e the dispute, and he believed that if he had done so the Government would not have been left in a minority. If he was elected, he should certainly
give no factious opposition to any measures tha' might be introduced, and lie should be the more inlined to support Lord Palmerston becaase ho believed that he was reay a Conservative at heart. ("Hear," and a lugh.)
A show of hands was then talkon, which was declared in favour of Mr. Cowe rand Sir Minto Farquhar. A polli was demanded on beh'Ifof Mr. Chambers, which will commenice at 8 this (Friday) morning and finaly close at 5. The contest between Mr. Chambers and Sir . Farquhar is expected to be a very close one.

Mr. Overend, the Conservative candidate, has during the week addresed sveral maetings of electors, convened by circular. On Wedlnesday night he addrmesse a crowade meeting of electors and non-electors in the Sessions.room. of the Town-halL. A. considearable numaber of the friends of Messrs.

Prom this circumstance the meeting was very disorderly, but on the whole good tempered. Mi. Hawksworth resided.
Mrx. OvausEND was received with cheering and hooting. In the course of hIds address, which Was very ion , and.continually interrupted, he went at lengthL intote Chines

COVENTRY.
The nomination took place here yesterday morning, at 10 o'clock, from the hustings in the 3Market-place. The candidtes were oar. Ellice, Sir J. Paxton, Mr. Mellor, Q.C, Mr. Iorau Treherne (Tory), and Mr. B. J. philimore j (Liberal-Conservative).
[ Ir. T. RA.NnUiY (alderman reposed, and Mr. COLE (maer riband weaver' seconded, . Ellice.
MIr. SIBLLYWITTTEM (town councillor and cnrrier) proposed, and Mr. W. HL GAiDS-ER (artisan), seconded the noD ination of Sir Joseph Paxton.
Mr. Morgan Treherne was nominated by MIr. CoBLEY (pubican), and seconded by Mlr. GEORGE HANDS, a Weaver.
Mr. E. K. DUNNE proposd, and Mr. Nxwavsosiseconded, the nomination of Mr. Mellor.
Mr. t. K. ROTR?RsAX (magistrate) proposed, and Xr.W. LvNxs (ex-mayor) seconded, M1r. Phillimore.
Air. ELLICE %aid that during his connexion with the electors he and they had together fought many battles; they had seen violent changes of parties, and they had had elections which he would not describe then, since the times of such scenes had now paed by; but when a public man, after long service, found, at a time when there was no strong feeling abroad, at a time when every man exercsed big calm opinion, that both from friends and former opponents he was receiving the support which it was apparent he (Mr. Ellice) was receiving on that occasion, that was the greatest reward which he could receive. He thanked them for their good opinion, and hoped that at the poll on the next day they would yet further express their goodwill by supporti'g those men who, having the cause of the people at heart, might be relied upon to do their duty.
Sir JosEPH PAXTON then came forward, and said that although he could not give so long an account of his stewardship as his right hon. friend, yet he hoped that he had done nothing since they had given him their confidence to warrant them in not giving him another trial. When he came among them to solicit their suffrages he had no personal interestin viow, and hewould appeal to the Liberal interes in that city to say whether he had not faithfully represented them. He had on atl occasions given the most independent votes. When he believed the Government to be in the right he had supported them to the uttermost, and when he had supposed them to be in tie wrong he had not done so. He had done his utmost for the comfort of the British soldiery when they were in the 33ast, and he had supported Lord Palmerston against factious oppositions; and if they returned him again he should give that noble lord an independent support. He had been a Liberal aUl his life, had aIways voted for Liberal measures, and if they re-elected him he should pursue a sumilar course.
Mr. MoRGA-N TREHERNE said that more than 20 years had elapsed since he firxt addressed them as a candidate for the representation of that ancient city, and he now found hinmaelf in a most peculiar situation-a situation which to men with less " pluck" than himself would have been fatal to his showing his face in Coventry that day. He, however, threw himself with confidence on the people. He had been deserted by those who for years had given him their support, and he had been refated admittance to the balcony from which he had often had the pleasure of addressing them (the King's Head balcony).
The after remarks of the hon. candidate were lost to the reporters from the shouting of the electors.
Mr. MELLOSI annourced that he would give a general support to Lord Palmerston.
Mr. PHILLDIOR15 followed, merely sayingthathe followed the polcy of Sir Robert PeeL
The show of hands was declared by the Mayor to bo in favour of the sitting members, aud a poll was dumanded by the other three candidates.
The whole proceedings were accompanied with great tumnult, and it was with difficulty that the remarks of any of the speakers could be heard X fen on the hustings, Mr. Elce and Sir J. Paxton, however, being listened to by the electors with more patience than was bestowed upon either of the other candidates.
NORTHAMWPTONSHIRE (SOUTH1).
The contest in this division of the county is Increasing in intensity. On Wednesday Lord Althorp personally canvassed his constituents in Syresham and Brackley. At the latter place he addressed an enthusiastic audienco at great length. After a general review of the state of parties, and an ample exposition of his ow;n Liberal principles, his Lordship concluded by saying that he was an advocate of civil and religious liberty. He thought that every one should have perfect freedom in his reigoas views; and he did not think the State should tax a man heavily, or at all, for the support of views which he did not hold. (Cheers.) He was a warm supporter of the Church of England, and he would carry out the views that men should support what they professed. (Applause.) He supported the Church of England, and he thought every man shoald support the religion he preferred. If they did him the honour to return him to Parliatnent, ho would go unpledged to anything. He had formed his opinions on public matters after much thought and deliberation. He would not say that he would not alter them, but he would give every question his best consideration, in order that he might arrive at a just conclusion; and he hoped they wfould put confidence in him, and he had little doubt but that he should falfil all his publicduties. (Loud cheers.)
WORCESTER.
A crowded meeting of the electors was held at the Guildball on Wednesday night to hear an expositiou of principles by Mr. Alderman Sidney.
Alderman SwDstw addressed the meeting at great length. He said he would not be retarned as the tool of any party in the House of Commons. A great number of the constituencies returned members to Parliament solely that they might vote s party leaders dictated to them, and not as the people required of them. If ihey returned members merely to support any of the leading interests in Parliament, they were encouraging them to vote in support of faction; and he expressed an opinion that the legislation of the last 10 years wras a disgrace to the British statute-book. He himself had been a working man, and was well aware of the hardships of the present system of rating to the poor.
KENT (WEST).
(BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPR).
A numerous and influential meeting of the electors of the Gravesend district of West Kent was held in the Assembly Room of the Literary Institution last night. Messrs. Wykeham Mlartin and James Wbatman, the Liberal candidates, addressed the meeting at considerable length in explanation of their political principles and of the grounds upon which they hsd respectively supported the polcy of Lord Palmerston in the Chinese question. Both gentlemen pledged themselvesto a contirued support of the general policy of Lord Palmerston's Administration so long as it sustained the national honour, and acted in support of the Liberal principles, particularly the extension of the franchise.
The meeting enthusiastically cheered the speeches of the hon. candidates, and unanimously adopted a resolution to the effect that it would use every exertion to promote their joint return as the representatives of the western division of Kent.
So successful has been the canvass of Mr. Whatman that it is confidently stated in the town that the Conservative candidate, Mr. Smith, will not abide the test of the poll.
EDINBURGE.
On Wednesda3yIlir. Black addressed a large meeting of the electors of Edinburgh in the Music-ball there, the Lord Provost presiding. The hon. candidate remarked that during the session of 1856 there had been no subject of vital importance brought before Parliament, but the most exciting questions had been those coniests for place and power, in all of which he had supported Lord Palmerston, being convinced that he was the pilot best qualified to weather the storm. (Cheers.) After some remarks on various subjects he contended that the Scotch members, generally speaking, were the soundest of any class of representatives sent to Parliament. If they examined the votes of Scottish members they would always find that the majority of them had voted on the right side, whether the sight side had prevailed or not. In the China debate, for instance, therevwere 25 Scotch members forthe Ministry, and 17 against, and, had the English and Irish members voted in the same proportions for and against Government, Lord Palmerston, instead of being in a minority of 16, would have had a majority of 96.
At the close of a lengthened address Mr. Sheriff YOmiG, seconded by Mr. G. E. RUnssELL, movedih.at MIr. Black wals a fit and proper person to return to Parliament, which resolution was carried by acclamaltion.
There is no opposition now to the return of the former members, Mr. Black and Mr. Cowan.

ANGLO-INDIAN SOCIETY.-Recently the tone of
ANoLO-INDLuN SOCIET9.-Recently the tone oF
Anglo-Indian Society, during the hot seasons, is very Much I improved. Six or seven years ago there never was a season that did not end as unhappily as that which I have attempted to describe; but it is now four years since I heard of a duel in the lUpper Brovinces,-upwards of four years sinee I heard of a victim to g%mbling,- and nearly three since there was an elopement. It is true that the records of courts-martial still occasionally exhibit painful cases, but, if we compare the past with the present, wemust adnit that the change is very satisfactory. I do not attribure this altered state of things to the vigilance of commanding officers or the deternmination of the commandein.chief to punish severely those who offend. It is due cbiefly to the improved tone of society in England, from which country wve get our habits and manners. The improvement in the tone of Indian society has been very gradual. Twenty years ago India was famouas for its infamy. Ten years ago it was very bad. It is now tolerable. In ten years from this date, if not in less tuue, Indtan Eociety wll be purged entirely of those evils which now prey upon it, and trials for dmtikenness and other improper conduct will happen as rarely as in England. Year by year the commutnication between our fatherland aud the upper part of India will become more speedy and lesS expensivo; and thus will a greater number of officers be cnailed to come honme on furlough for a year or two. Nothing does an Indian officer to mach good as a visit to Europe. When a man has once contracted bad habits in Iudia ho cannot re. form in India. To be cured he must be taken away for a rhile from the country. There have been intances of officers who have had strength of mind to alter their course of life without leaving the East, but those instances are very few.-Eousehlo Wo,di.

Election Intelligence.
BLECTION INTBLLIaENCE.
CITY OF LONT)hov
Yesterday was a scene of great bustle and activity in the city. Thee canvassers of the respective candidates redoubled their exertions, but the number of promises is still far too small in proportion to the number of voters to justify any positive opinion as to the result of the election. It may, however, be stated that Lord John Russell's supporters were more confident yesterday than they have hitherto been, and they now express a sanguine opinion that Lord John will be returned. Sir James Duke's weat is considered in some danger, but the result is far too speculative to warrant any prediction on the subject. The course taken by the Liberal Registration Association is sharply debated, and the business committee of that body have issued a statement repelling the charge of dictation. and asserting that the association have only obeyed publio opinion. One of Lord John's supporters has applied totbo noble lord to know whether he had intimated, before the first meeting of the Liberal Pegistration Association, that he did not intend to seek to be re-elected on the present occasion. Lord John's reply is, that at one time he had intended to retire from the representation of the city, but that no one was authorized to declare that intention, nor wa any one entitled to presume that he meant to retire when the resolation of the Liberal Registration Association excluding him from the list of candidates was come to. When that resolution came to his Imowledge he resolved to fight the battle of the independence of the city of London against this attempt at dictation, and he considered that he was no longer at liberty to consult his own ease by retiring.
The nomination takes place this day at Guildhall, at 12 o'clock, and as there are five candidates, and fifteen speeches of greater or less length to be delivered, the proceedinga promise to be of a protracted character, unless the proposers and seconders study a commendable brevity. The polling takes place to-morrow (Saturday). There are upwards of 19, voters on the register.
MARYLEBONE.
The hustings erected in Park-place have been placarded with an announcement that Mr. Hoare and MIr. BevanL have declined to entertain the contemplated requisition to them, and, as nothing has been made publio to show that the discontented have carried their grievance elsewhere, there is every probability that Sir B. Hall and Lord Ebrington will be elected to-day without opposition. This result, however disappointing to those to whom the chief feature of an election Is tho I' expenses " (and it is stated that they were at least 9,0W10t. at the last election), wiU, no doubt, be most gratifying to the great body of the electors.
ABINGDON.-Mr. Ralph A. Earle, whose appearance here was noticed in Tile Times of yesterday, has withdrawn from his opposition to Mr. J. T. Norris, the Liberal candidate.
BRIDoEWvATER.-Mr. A. Otway, the late member for Stafford, was invited to become a candidate for Bridgewater, accompanied by an offer to return him withont expense, bat he declined the invitation.
BRIDPORT.-Mr. Heygate and Mr. Mturrough have resigned the contest for this borough. Mr. N. ltodgson and Mr. Mitchell will therefore be declared elected without a. polL
CAlRDIFF.-Mr. E. A. Freeman and Dr. Nicholl Carue have retired, and Colonel Stuart will conseauently walkover the course. The retirement of Messrs. Freeman and Carne vws both honourable to themselves and satisfactory to the constituency. The election will take place on FCriday.
CARLISLE.-(By Electric Telegraph.)-Sir J. Graham, Mr. Ferguson, and Xr. Hodgson were yesterday put in nomination, and a poll demanded.
CmRENCESTER-Mr. MIullings, the late member, is unable to wait lpon the electors personally on account of continued illness.
F,,LMOUTm AND PxPnRYx.-Mr. Bowel Gwyn, the Conservative candidate, and ore of the late meonbers for this borough, withdrew from the contest on Tuesday by formal communication to Mr. Baring; and the field is now left clear to the latter gentleman and Mr. Gurney, who will walk over the course to-morrow (Friday), whereby both seats wil be ranged on the side of the Government at this election,-a total reverse of political position in favour of Lord Palmerston.
FLINT.-The electors of this county were addressed at the GuildhaU on Wednesday by the Right lion. W. Ewart Gladstone, on behalf of his brother-in-law, Sir Stephen Glytine, who is a candidate for the county, in opposition to the Honi. Mr. Mostyn. The chair ras taken hy Mr. Richard Muspratt, the Mayor of the borough. Mr. Gladstono complained of the conduct of the Ministry in. naking vway withot the consent of the Houso of Commons, and denounced Sir John Bowriug in connexion with the Arrow affair, stigmatizing him as the utterer of a falsehood in regard to the registry of that vessel; and further svent on to speak of the extravagant estimates brought forvard by Lord Palmerston's Government, concluding by moviig a vote of want of confidence in those members of Parliament who had supported the Budget; after whlich Sir Stephen Glynne addressed the meeting. Some exceptions to Mr. Gladstone's statements were taken by Mr. Bate, a borough magistrate, and by r. Ellis lSyton, the town clerk. The raoyor put the preposition to the meeting, when, out of aboutn00 people who .were present, 23 held np their hands for it and 11 a gainst. It was therefore declared carried, but the meeting is not looked upon as at all a triumuph to Sir ntephen Glynne or his party.
GLAMorotsAX;scREI.-31r. Talbot (Lord-Lieutenant) and Mr. Hussey Vivian (late M.P. for Truro) arc sure of being returned. In theeastern end of the county, where it was considered alr. Vaughan was strongest, he turns oat to be in a minority.
GLoCEsMTESESRtP (WVST).-It is now definitely settled that there will be no contest in this county. A meeting of the Liberal Registration Sodety was held in Glocester on Saturday, and most of the heads of the party were present. It was resolved to offer no opposition to the return of Mr. Rolt, Q.C., the Conservative candidate, inthe place of Mr. R. B. Hale. Several iron and coal masters of the Forest were previously spoken of as likely to become candidates in the Liberal interest. Mr. Grantley Berkeley has again addressed the electors, stating-
* It is not my intention to beeask the pmee of teb dirion, but had It been broken I shouldhave solieltec yoer suffrages as a eandldate

HEsRtFoRDSIsTrR.-Mr. B. Blakemore has published the reasons why he was absent from the division on the Chinese war. He begs at once to avow that he was "absent by design," and he adds:-
" I mistrusted the motion or resolutlon ameved by lr.Cobdeu. an

HIRTFORDSucIRn.-In our impression of Monday last
under the head of eiection intelligence, we gave a sketch of the present state of electioneering parties in Hertfordshire. They present so strange a medley that it may not be asist to describe the whole circumstance as they at present stand. On the announcement of the dissolution of Parliament meetings were as a matter of course held by those associations to which, as in other constituencies, is committed the organization of elections. Among others the Conservative Registration Society held a meeting at the Red Lion, at Hatfield. At this meetinz the three sitting mnembers were present-viz, Sir Henry Meux, Sir Edward Buiver w ytton, and Mr. Abel Smith, jun.,all three Conservatives-all three having voted in the antiMinisterialmajority. This meeting was notably held for the purpose of considering a compromise offered by tho Wbig or Liberal Association to theo effect that by the withdrawal of one Conservative candidate and the admission of one Whig the county night escape the expense andturnmoilof acontest. Resolutions wereconsequentlypassed for the appointment of,a committee to consider this offer if thought advisable to enter into negotiations with the Whig committee, and, should those negotiations be successful, to choose the candidate who should retire. The resolutions were unmanimously passed, the tlreenmembersgivingtheir fallandunconditionalpledgetoabideby the award of the comnuittee. Theconmmittee sat fortwo bours, at length arriving at thedeterminatiuonto outerinto thenegotiation, and, if successful in obtaining guarantees from the other party, to eliriinate fromn the represent4tion the senior member, Sir Henry Menux, whose bealth it was generally known was unequal to the ta.k of representing a large and populous county. The u'ecision of the committee was made known to the members with the exception of the name of the dooned candidate, whose fate depended on the answer of the Liberal Committee. With this understanding, however, the members departed to their homes, while the committee repaired to London to communicate with the other contracting p,rties. Bitt it appears that duriW his drive to Theobald's gloomy vision3 came across the maind of Sir Henry Meuttx. On his arrival at his seat, therefore, he had decided on a course of action. He wrote a letter to an inflluerti md1 hiiiber of the Conservative Asso-
ciation, declaring his intention not to abido by his plIedgq should tho decision be adverse to himself. This letter was communicated to the committee, however, only after arrangements had been finally concluded. Since that )?Tiod
statements havo appleared and eounter-statement y Siry
Henry lMenx in w,hich ,while declaring himself a mar>, ho does uot, deny his pletigo, but annouces his intentpn oL ant
ke9eping it. Thls couduct, however, has beea sastisfao tdty to all partie that; a representation has ksuo wal t&
him, with the signaturms of the leading personages of the county, both Conservative and1 Liberal, suggesting that he is boundirIn honour to retire from the contbest.
STATFO'RD (SOUTfl).-Mr. William Orme Foster, of ftourton Castle, has just come forward to represent South Staffordshire in conjunction with Mr. William Mathew.
Lams.-As the day of nomination (Friday) draws nigh 'the political excitement in this borough increases. The -contest promises to be an arduous one. The Hon. xL T. uAines and Mr. John Remington Mills, the Liberal candi'dates, have addressed several large meetings of their saipiporters in different parts of the borough every day during -the week, and an active canvass on their behalf has been .made. Nor are the Conservatives less zealous on behalf of -their candidate, Mr. Robert Hall, who bas addressed many assemblies of his supporters during tho present and preceding -week, and has been well received. Mr. Baines and Ar. Hlall, being natives of Leeds, while Mr. Mills was unknoyan

hIA&CCLEWIELD.Mtr. Thomas l-luggiris, sharebroker, SLondon, has comne furwvard in the Liboral interest, but as -a supporter of Lord Palmerston.
MALLOW.-Mr. Windsor has retired from the contest.
OXFORDSIsR g.-An unexpected onponent to the late mnembers for this county camne forward yesterday. HLas eignature is H. Peliy Hinde. 75, Ecleston-square, London. In his address he professes Protestant against Rooman Catholic principles, would continue for the present -the reduced ineome-tax, regrets that free trade has not ,been extended to agriculture, and suins up as follows:-
" Vlth reference to our position in China I can only add that which erery true and Cliristian friend of humanity nwust neceesrily do, my regretg for the larrre.table destruc'len of pr.perty and eonsequent los ot life3 entailed upon the Chinese by reasot ot their wilful poridy. reSuiting in the open r.pture that has take-n l1ate.

Inused scarcely add that I am prepared to uphol thin policy in alliIts eon"ttlerices.'
; PE-rEitPo: ouols.-A fierce contest is waging here be. tween Mr. Hankey and Msr. WVhalley. Both gentlemen have addressed publiv meetings and reported the result of their canvass as roost satisfactory. The lon. C. W. Fitzwilliam's seat is considered to be quite safe. On Wednes-day night a meeting of Mr. Hankey and his friends was held -at the WVentworth Assembly-roomis. The hon. gentleman explained andjustified bistwovoteswwhiohhad been principally questioned-one against Mr. Spooner's urotion relating to Maynooth, and1 the other against the Sebastopol Committee. Tbe nomination wiU take place to-day.
SOUTH SIIIELDS.-Mr. lnballtr addressed a densely crowded meeting of the electors rif this borough on Wednes. day eveninig. After a lengtheiied explanation of the votes he had given duriig the past Parlianiieiit, the hon. gentle.man said that ]r, had voted against i-r. Cobdens, motion because he looked upon it as a vote of censure. In fact, 3Nr. Disraeli on the last night of the debate challenged the -Government upon it as a vote of censure, and said he was ready to go down and meet Lord Paslmerston at Tiverton upon it. Buibr dare he go there now:' No ! no doubt he would now quake to meet anybody of hi3 coiuntryYuen on such an issue. I.Ir. ] ngham vindicated the course takeri by our agents in China. It was nrw s- id by nrany who had voted against the Government that they would not have dune so had Lord Palumerston announced his intention of sendiung ont a plenipotentiary but he was of opinion that had Lord Palmirerston made that pcromise the hon. gentlemen vwho nsed snch an excuse would have fouiid some other ground on which to justify their Totes. Mtr. Inghamn declared himself as an advocate of the ballot and an extension of the suffrage, and was prepared to give Lord Palmerston's Government a finn and cordial support.
TY.xxutor'-ric.-(ByElectricTelegraph.)--Mr. Linshill. the Conservative canididate, retiredyesterday evening. Mr. IV. S. Lindsay is, therefore, unopposed. Had a poU taken place there was no doubt of an overwvhel;sing majority for Mr. Lindsay.
SCOTLA.XND.
BERWVICK.'iIIREa-In answer to a request miade by a meeting of electors at Douse, Mr. D. NMarj .ribanks Robertson, of Lad} kirk (brother of the late bMr. Charles bl arjori. banks, who fonnierly represented the county\, has agreed to come forward for this county in opposition to the Hon. Francis Sentt, who has occupied tbe seat in the Consers-ative interest since 1847. Mr. Robertson describes himself as " a moderate but earnest and decided Liberal, and with hearty goodwill a cordial supporter of the present Govern. -ment." He strongly condemns the vote on the China
.question which has led to the dissolution of Parliament.I Unfortunately, he has been for five weeks, and still is, con| faned to his house in consequence of a severe hunting nccident, so that he will be uniable to undertake a canvass, -and may possibly not be able to ap;'aar at the hastings at ths election.
LiTII BnJRCII.-A very keen canvass is going on in ,these burghs. Nvhichi are contestedl by the Lord-Advocate and Mr. Miller. The poU takes pl.ace to-day (Friday), and the Lord-Advocate has been urging his sapPorters in the various burghs to come out with a strong majority in his favour fron. the first, and up to the cloE of the poll to relax no exertion to show their confidence in him aud in Governmenit. The other side are scarcely less sanguine of -sucess. The contest is almost altogether a personal one. Mr. Miller rests his claims on the s-le ground of his being a mnerchant, while a large portion of the support given hint arises froin the fact that the bhrghs have been represented by an uninterrupted succession of Wlhig Lord-Advocates since the Reform B1i3, an arrangeurent ws-hich many think unsuitable to a mercantile constirirorray. (By Electric Telegraph.) - Mr. Moncreiff (the Lord - Advocate) and Mr. Miller were nominated yesterday, anid a poll demanded.
PERTII.-(Ey Electric Telegraph.;-The Hon. Arthur K3innaird was this day returned for l'ertli witthout opposition, being the first member returned for Scotland to serve in the new Parlianient.
PERTHSIIIRF.-RLord James Murray, who had announced his intention to contest this county, now states in an address to the electors that, contrAry to his expectation, Mr. Stirling had expressed himself in i-is address as approving geiieraily the: home policy followed by Lord Palmerston, and the vigour and judgmrent witb which lie had terminated the late, war; and a converhstion which he had held with Mlr. Stirliiig having satisfied hiil tilat his political sentimients coincided in a great degree with his owvn, he does not consider himself justified in involving the county in a contested election.
IRELAXD.
CAVAN COSNTY.-Mr. O'Reilv Dease, the High Sheriff of Louth, has addressed the electors of Cavan. In his address lie gives his adhesion to the principles of a genuine tenant right bill, and declares hinmself to be independenit of all parties, and unwilng to sacrifice liis position for place or personal eiilolument. le opposes two Conservatives in Cavan, and will therefore have an active contest,
COstar CITY'.-Tlie Hon. Coloniel Hutchlinsoni has seen the folly of his attempt to win one of tho seats, and has beat a timely retreat. Messrs. Beamish an-I Fagan, therefore, will be returned oa Saturday without a contest.
DoNvN COUNTY.-Tlle rational Conservatism of Mr. Ker having given offeniee to the enlightened electors of the county, i ultra Tory has been set sup, in the person of Colonel Fords, whose address is published in the local .iorrnaha.
DEUBLI2N CIITY.-As so much has been hitherto said of the certainty of Coiiservative success, it is but right to mention that witbi n the last two days matturs- have assumed a very different asnect, and there is at present good reason for bolieving that the supporters of Messrs. Grogan and Vance are by no nieass so sanguine as they were before the Liberal candidates had actually entered the lists. At all events, an argent whip, in the form of a eircul.ar, has been served upon the Pr.itestant electors entreating their prompt attendance at the poll on Tuesday niorisiig, and, as the reason, that not a vote can be spared. All, however, depends upon the unity of the freeiiien. Shoulld there be any extens:ve defection or apathy on the part of this body, the Liberals -vould have iiiore than a fair chance of carrying the day.
GALWVAY Boitoulal.-Annuierous meetinz of the electors was held on Wedniesday, when it was decided by a large majority that every exertion should he miade to place Mr. P. Blake, Q C., at the head of the poll. The struggle, therefore, -will be between the learned gentleianst anid LordDankellin.
GALWVAY CourjrY.-As yet the- ol-i members retain tem - porary possession. From the followving corresponidence it will be seea that Sir T. Redington has been completely enuffed oUr. The hon. knight's retenition of office during the stormy debates on the Titles Bill, anoi subsequent to its enactment, has sealed his doom, at least as regards his pretentions to be " the man for Galway."'

QuE,x's C0ou?Ty.-There is, it seems, to be a contest here. The Freemny's Journal states that the advanced Liberals are reaking most energetic efforts to return a manl
on the independent opposition principle. A very hearty -sall bas already been madeon Mr. Joho Maacniara Cantwell, of thin city, asking him to come forward. His address is, however, only conditional, and intirrteis that if he thought he would receive similar support in the other baronies he wrouSoorne forward as a candidate. Tire Right Hon. Johin Wibson Fitzpatnick has addressed the slectors of the Queen' s
County. A requisition from the barony of Ossory, in this county, has been presented to him, calling on him to allowr himself to be pot in nomination. Like iii. Cautwell's, tea address of Mr. Fitzpatrick i3 only conditional.
TnB Un-aivERsTy.-Mx. Anthony Lefroy declines coming forward on the present occasion, as any farther division of the Conservative interest could be badly afforded just now, -when there is likely to be trouble enough in store for the late members The names of the acting committee of Mr. Iawson, the Liberal Conservative, inidicate a material change in the leanings of the College taken in its corporate caieiaty. They include those of eleven junior fellows, six bemg clergymen, ten scholars of tbe house, the Professor o:
Political Economy. Archbishop King's Lecturer in Divinty, &c. The list is not yet, nearly comnpleted.

The numerical estimates founded on the retirements and the new candidates, opposed or unopposed, range from a Ministerial gain of from 25 to 40, counting, of course, for twice those figures on a division. But, though it may be easy enough to enumerate a dozen counties in which a Conservative goes out and a Liberal comes in, and more than that number of boroughs, there is a more serious and difficult question, which ic would take much reading of speeches and addresses, much interpretation of political phrases, and much scanning of personal character to answer. In what precise direction are the changes ? In wnat respect will the new Parliament differ from the old ones ? Appearances, so far, justify an opinion that the new Parliament will be rather wanting in distinctive character, and that it will be exactly such as might be expected to meet at the invocation of a statesman -who, with ardent patriotism, a great love of liberty, and a genial temperament, had not entered very hotly and bitterly into the domestic feuds of his country. The one thing that harmonizes all the election addresses and speeches is broad love of country, to an extent involving the speakers in considerable absurdities. Our eyes have not yet lighted on a single address which suvgests a suspicion that the writer is ready to hand over the honour of his country to be trampled on by barbarians for any reason whatever. All sides are agreed on the necessity of going on as we have begun, whether we began right or wrong. So, as Government took the course they did because they thought it right, and their opponents are anxious to proceed with it for the sake of Old England, though they think it abstractedly wrong, the latter exhibit even stronger evidence of patriotibm than the former. It is, at al events, very clear that we are not to look into our relations with the Emperor of CIINA, or, indeed, into foreign affairs, for the distinctive character of the new Parliament, and the gain on the elections this way or that. If there is any change to be expected in this quarter, we are inclined to expect, that the topics of the Arrow, Sir J. BownmIN, his vanity, and monomania having been exhausted, and the causes of international humanity and justice having become rather threadbare with six weeks' violent agitation, the agitators on the meeting of Parliament wil make a rush to new topic. That will naturally be the necessity of more vigorous, prompt, and decisive measures. After censuring Government for not having stopped what took place two months before it was heard of in this country, the censurers will next May be equaUy impatient that China has not been brought to reason before the possible arrival of reinforcements, or even orders, from this country. At the distance of 12,000 miles time will always be against the Executive, and the Opposition wiU always hear bad news for months before it can be set right.
Where, then, are we to look for the difference between the new Parliament and the old ? The addresses are unusually vague; generalities are greatly in request ; painful experience leads the candidates to commit themselves not an inch deeper or to one more measure than they need do; and it is not easy to say, in some cases, whether the candidate is M-inisterial or Opposition. Indeed, this source of consolation has already occurred to the organs of the Opposition. Admitting the loss of a score seats, they ask, " iWhat does it signify, "when nobody is committing himself, and there
is no one measure or principle in question?" Lord PAam1xSro2{, say his opponents, has not committed his own side, and it was not in the power of the Opposition to commit theirs; so there is nothing really before the country except a few extravagances of political opinion, such as the Ballot, for example, which will always have advocates, but will never become law. There certainly is more indifference and laxity than usual, and there are other less pardonable derelictions of principle. At one seaport we are told that the two Conservative candidates have 81lCceeded in persuading some of the voters that Lord PAEr.tsToNcl desires their return over a member of his own Administration; and a good many of the speeches and addresses really leave it quite open whether the speakers will support Lord PA-mfxxsTos or not. Some of these gentlemen, no doubt, are only waiting for their retainers, and don't think it necessary to give pledges to constituents whom they are obliged to pay in a more solid currency. Yet we are constrained to say-and we do not think any side has much reason to rejoice for what is nobody's gain-there will be at least the usual proportion of members unattached. Those who have least reason to rejoice in this prospect are they who have most stood on certain measures or positions. Neither Mr. COnDDE2, nor Lord DzRBY, nor -Ir, GrADMSIONE, can think himself the better for a change which seems to leave people more at liberty than ever, and morethan ever exposed to influences beyond the reach of speculation. They gentlemen have hitherto relied on the formation of certain political schools. Those schools, however, have received a severe interruption, not to say check, by the process of sending every legislator back to mother earth, to return after an interval less swathed and fettered than he was before.
But, if this is to be all the change, what was the use of the dissolution ? Ay, what was the use of it? That is a question for MIr. COBDEn
Lord D)EBY, Mr. GLADSTONE, and a few other gentlemen to answer,-not for ourselves. We may pursue the inquiry still further. What was the use of the censure ? Indeed, what possible good could result from a Parliamentary decision on a merely historical dispute,-one which involved no practical difference? A new Parliament assembled upon the question whether one Sir J. BowIxnce acted as discreetly as he should have done on the other side of this planet in the month of November, A.D. 1856, is about as farcical an idea as could occur to the wildest visionary that ever employed himself on paper constitutions. The dispute has already died a natural death, and Sir JoHN BowRiNG has fulfilled a political
purpose he never contemplated in being made the excuse for an unpledged Legislature. That there is no great question now before the nation is a fact that need be placed to the charge of no man and no party. It is chiefly owing to the absorbing questions, or rather to the grand crises, of foreign policy throuigh -which we have been passing, and which have left but small time, interest, or means for domestic legislation. It is owing in some degree to that division and subdivision of parties wihich puts it in the power of so mauy people, individually unequal to positive results, to frame resolutions that will muster a majority for the occasion against almost any measure. For som time past there has been scarcely any meas3e, however good and necessary, that it was not in the power of an "aggregation of discordant elements" to throw out. Hence that pa3aiysis of our domestic legislation -which Loxd PA xsrow found already existing when 'he took the reins of power, and which a sr;ccession of temporary combinations against him has continued to the present time. -No doubt, -.oo,-and we are ready to make the admission,- -the fact of a Premier more engaged hitherto , foreign than in domestic policy teni
to leave this an unoccupied ground. Lord P~.
AIERST' jW is not a statesman of 'that class -i6h ivista is xe3pQation on this or thati meawapt, qr
-which takes its stand on this or that defidite proposal. He has not his new constitutfon, or his sixth part of one, accurately defined, numbered, surveyed, appraised, and reduced to a tabular statement. He has not a form of words ready for subscription. When called upon, as in the 13ome-office lately, and when put on his mettle, he did good ser-vice in the removal of several home nuisances that liad baflled our greatest domestic reformers; and we have no doubt he will show equal alacrity whenever required. In his own words, he is for " progressive improvement," and, as you may buy a horse with a willow before you can buy a saddle for it with an oak, we have no doubt that for the next 20 years " progressive improvementf' viu do ten times as much as "radical reform." But it has also the quality, be it good or bad, of not binding men so severely and irrecoverablyto this or that political opinion. All can lend a hand at gradual amelioration-at that slow and sure work which is described somevwhere as " line upon line " and precept upon precept ;" but it is not everybody who can or will apply the axe to the root of the tree, or the lever to the foundation of his house. "Progressive improvement,"then, is the most comprehensive, the directest, and the surest line, and will, we believe, be the characteristic of the new Parliament. It supposes no theory, it rests on no pledge, it makes no party, and is therefore the proper work of an unpledged Legislature.
Can anybody be so cold as to say a word in dis-
Can anybody be so cold as to say a word in dispraise of oratory this day, or even in the way of caution and qualification ? Can any one be so unsympathetic, so unsusceptible and dry, as to do this to-day, which is devoted to oratory, on which so many thousand speeches will be made from proposers, seconders, supporters, and candidates ? What an experience will have been gained of the difficulties of oratory by a great number of gentlemen before they go to bed to-night ! The old hands, used to their own standard, and knowing exactly what they can do and what they cannot in the way of speaking, will take the result easily enough; but the fresh men, of whom there will be a certain proportion, both among supporters and candidates, the speakers for the first, and nearly the first, time to a crowd-what a keen experience will have been gained by these first essayists of the difficulty of oratory, by that most cruel ordeal-the actual trial ! How many bitter recollections, how many vain regrets, will torment to-night's pillow ! How many tbings intended to be said will revisit the orator, -an abortion in one part of a speech, a flounder in another, all the more provoking because he cannot tell how in the world he got into it ! He had his sentence in his head quite right only an hour before, quite pat for the occasion, and only waiting the moment of summons; but somehow it was gone when wanted, and was not in the corner in which he had stored it up. What a moment of despair that was when he saw an empty void before him, which had to be filled by a violent rush and a sudden creative effort, which shook the mental fabric to its basis! What an airy thing is that structare of words called a speech I A breath dissolves it, a stir in the corner of the room, a voice from the middle of the crowd, somebody talking close to you just when you were making the last internal review and launching yourself! "What
a fool I was not to think of that; what a mess "I made of such a sentence; how that simile "collapsed, how awkwardly I began, and as for "the ending, I really must not think of it." Such wAIl be the noctumal visitings of many a tender oratorical conscience; and they will moreover produce, as their natural result, a sort of morbidly high estimate of the value of the gift of oratory. On the principle of the old proverb, " Qiti ncscit cancre semper canere laborat," a man who feels that he cannot speak wants particularly i to be able to speak,-the explanation which we suppose is to be given of the extraordinary and indomitable perseverance of many excellent men who go on to the end of their lives speaking at every public meeting within manageable distance of their places of residence, but never improving in the art. The stimulus is simply the forbidden talent or power which they are resolved to vote themselves in possession of, merely because Nature has resolved the other way. A man who can speak a litte is in great danger, and should be anxiously watched by aU his friends; he lives on the very verge of a sad delusion, into which he may fall at any moment, and which, if it once takes hold of him, will send him all his life long following an oratorical will-of-the-wisp, much to his own discomfiture, just emerging perpetually out of the ditches of language, and making his way splashed and dirty out of bad sentences, and lucky if he does.
For the consolation, then, of all gentlemen who may on this day not make the very best appearance as speakers in our town-halls and places of nomination, and to correct any too high and morbid estimate of the value of this gift, we wil just remind them, first, of what they are already, perhaps, fully aware of-that they may be very clever, shrewd, penetrating, and powerful men without it; and, secondly, that oratory is by no -means an omnipotent talent in this country. This very election is a snub to the orators. The orators in the House of Commons all spoke for the resolution which has dissolved Parliament and sent back so many gentlemen humbly apologizing to their constituencies for that vote. We estimate this gift at its true worth, and no more. We respect good speaking as a sterling talent ; but, while we admire, we distrust oratory. Does anybody belonging to the thinking and intelligent class really hear oratory in this coumtry without a latent inward salvo and protest against being carried away by it? He may keep it under for a time, just enough to prevents its interfering with the due and measured pleasurable excitement of the occasion, but the monitor is insensibly there all the time, and speaks when he is wanted. We are not Athenians, and those who govern us are not orators. Lord PA12nuRSTON is an excellent speaker; he says exactly what he wants to say, and conveys the idea he wants to convey ;. he makes a statement with al the shades and qualifications it may want, with a perfect commandc over all the flexibilities .sd aptnesses of good sterling English ; but Lord PA?.cERSTO?- iS notan orator. 31r. DISRAEL. and aMr. GLA.DsTo-B are onators, but they are not mcn to lead public opinion in this colutry. Why is this? Is it not because. there is something in oratory, as distinguished from good speaking, which is apt to mislead the jadgment and upset the balance of mind of the possessor of the gift ? Oratory is defined somvshere as being the art of making little things great. But this is a very dangsrous power to possess>-daugerols to the judgment of the man himself, because, when he is conscious of this power, he naturaUyy begins immediately to make his own estimate of things, nct. as they are, but -a he can make them. He knows he can, by the amplification 4, language, by illustbation and sentiment, swall olut a particular poinat in a case till it aunsles a most formidable si7.e; he knows Y 'has tlhe proportims oa things at his commapi iau this way, and the xery next azd perfectly vatural step is that his own judgment sympatlAvs with this power. In fact, you orator gets i!, &a little time so completely to regae5 the paints. i , csse in the lght in which they Gea be mai. to. tell upom other people, that h haiaraly diting;uishes 148jzWeen what is rQ%b ih thr. irgt-oa>4 wlut, i oratorical, and
he adopts a maxim-not unlike " whatever is i.S "right"-" whatever tel is true." Nor is this process only going on while he is actually speaking, for the truth is your orator is always speakirg; if be is not speaking to others he is speaking to himself. He thinks sonoroubly, he observes in rcunded periods, and he judges with a climax. As your man of learning is a walking dicticnary, your orator is a living and acting speech. The external speech is only the occasional and transient embodiment of a perpetual internal one, which is always going on to an invisible Parliament, which is always sitting within the orator's brain. The machine is always ready to convert, at a touch, any discovery, fact, or no fact into a speech, so that he is impeded by his own creative power, and cannot bend his judgment to any fresh tumn in the evidence of the case. The perpetual internal speech obstructs him, and he cannot move about easily with the cumbrous alligatorial appendage. Defend us, then, from being governed by orators ! WVe want men w-ho can think and men who can speak, but not men who can make things appear different from what they are by the mere power of language. Hoow completely was the whole Chinese case the creation of oratory ! But the nation is not so easily taken in.
English Admiralty Law has long enjoyed the
English Admiralty Law has long enjoyed the bighest consideration in Europe. WVe have been for 150 years the first of naval Powers. During the French revolutionary war we were, in the estimation of our enemies, the tyrants of the seas, the Carthaginians of modern times, initenit on hoisting our flag on every islet and monopolizing the commerce of every ocean. The meaning of this was, that our line-of-battle ships and frigates, corvettes and privateers, were successful everywhere, both in fighting and pillage. The merchant vessels of all the trading States of Europe were during a period of more than 20 years brought prizes into our ports to be adjudicated upon by our tribunals. It happened that at this time the ountry possessed a judge of pre-eminent merit. Sir W. SCOTT found the law which he was to administer a confused, a contradictory bundle of precedents, and by his wide comprehension, his clear judgment, and his singular felicity of expression, he raised it to the digniity of a science. The law of prize is mainly of English creation, and, though perhaps doomed to be swept away by new mitigations of the practice of warfare, it will ever remain full of interest to the student of international right. The decisions of the Judicial Committee of Privy Council within the last few days have established principles of no small importance in this branch of jurisprudence. It may be that Mr. PEFMERTON LEIGH and his colleagues are enunciating law wlich will soon be as of little real interest as the details of witch-testing or trial by battle; but as for the present the matter is a very practical one, and large sums of money will have to be made good by the Admiralty, we will give an account of the somewhat singular proceedings.
All the cases were appeals from the judgment of Dr. LusHINGrTo. The first is of comparatively small importance, as it involves only the restitition of a single ship and freight. The Ariel was a Russian ship, and before the commencement of the war belonged to a Mr. EcsiioFi, as administrator for Air. HAGEDORiN, Dutch Consul at Libau. When the war was on the point of breaking out the Libau merchants were anxious to got rid of their ships, even at a reduced price, to neutrals. MIr. SonRuNsEN, therefore, the Danish Consul at Libau, resolved to invest, but his residence and trading iu Russia made him, in the eye of international lawyers, a Russian subject, and his vessels liable to seizure. His son, however, was at the time carrying on the business of an agent in England. His son, then, might buy the vessels. SonPzENsr, junior, goes to Altona, resumes his Danish nationality, and buys his father's vessels and some others-among these latter the Ariel. The Ariel is then sent on a voyage to America, and returning enters the port of Belfast, presuming on her Danish flag. She is seizcd on the 2d of December, 1854, as a Russian sailing under false colours. SORENSEN, junior, appeals, but the ship is condenmed by the Judge of the Admiralty Court. The claimant then goes before the Privy Coimcil. Putting aside one or two nminor points, the questions for decision were, whether a sale of this kind was legal. That the Russian vendors disposed of the vessel to a neutral, imminent72 bMleo, was plain. WFould this make the contract void in the eyes of a belligerent ? The Privy Council have held that it would not if the sale were real and boxd fi4e. Even flagrat'ls bcUo, it is held that an enemy can dispose of his vessel to a neutral if that vessel be not iu. tra75Sit7', but actualy in port, and commences its next voyage as a neutral ship. The question, therefore, was whether this sale was bond jlde, and this was determined in favour of the claimant, from the particular circumstances of the case. It was held, however, that if the belligerent retained any interest in the vessel, in the shape of a lien or a stipulation for restitution on certain terms at the end of the war, the vessel would be lawful prize. Here it was urged against the claimant that the full price was not paid, and that he engaged to devote a proportion of the earnings to the liquidation of the sum agreed upoII. But this was hehl not to invalidate the transfer. The vessel was bo,nd tide sold to a neutral, although reedy money was not paid, and the interest of the seller must be held to have ceased. This decision greatly increases the power of belligerents to dispose of their maritime property. The highest Dritish Court has decided that an enemy can not only, vhen war is imminent, but when it is actually raging, dispose of his property to neutrals, provided the sale is absolute and bond fule, without the reservation of any interest to the seller.
The cases in which Mr. Pr-rmnarToNr Lxonn pronounced judgment on Wednesday are of far more imnmediate importance, and the decision turns upon a very curious and interesting point. The practical result is that a considera'xle numbe- of captures made by our fleet in the Black Sea must be held illegal, and, as the vessels have been sold, the claimants will have, to be reimbursed at the expense of the Admiralty. The case of the Gerasimo ias as follows.- The ship belonged to an Ionian finn at Galatz. Shle left that port under WTlIachian colours, laden with Indian carn, and bound for Trieste, and was seized as a prize by Captain PowE, of the Vesuvius, ca. the lath of July, 1854, as she was coming ouA of the Sulinam rou'.h of the Danube. Now, the are two points dwelt upon ia support of the capture-frst, that the Gerasimo belonged to an enemyas country; and, secondly, that she broke a blookade. The first plea is feunded on an assertion of the doctrine that territory held by a. Power must be considered to belong to it. In the present case such a principle works evidently with monstrous hardhip. The Russian forces invaded Mloldo-Widlachia in the summer of 1853. Theseprovincesfeamed part of the SUITr2sesempire; they never wi)imed to transfer, and did, in fact, never transfer their allegiance. And yet our naval authorities would assert that this temporary and lawless military occupation cooverted MoldoWallachia so entirely into a Russean province that Galatz must be hbld t?. be a Russian port, Wallachian or even, fore&,a merchants traders in a Russiau teravvy,. and their ships. consequently liable to uptum , It is tzv,
that in past timO we have, under the pressure of political danger, ac6l on this principle. When the French armies ov'ern Holland and added its foLees to their owxf, we at once declared war agaikst the country, conquered the Cape and the Spice Islands, and made prize of the Dutch marine. But in that case the whole resources of the country. had been turned against us. The Dutch soldiers were placed under French Generals, the Dutch navy bad encountered our own at Camperdown. Similar was our justification for prompt; measures against Spain. The countries and. their de f(scto Governments were at war with Us. But in this case there is no pretence for saying that the Danubian Provinces were Russian. They were still under the suzerainty of the PORTE, and Russia did not even pretend to hold Galatz by conquest, but merely to occupy it in a military sense. Moldavia and Wallachisa were not treated by the PoRTE as enemnieu, and therefore could not justly be so treated by us. Lord ELLEN-BOROUGH Mad held, during the last war, that a Government which yields to a superior force does not become a co-belligerent with the Power to which it yields; and we had ourselves recognized this principle by acknowledging the Moldo-Wallachian flag, and, consequently, declaring that no act of thce Russians had altered the nationality of the Provinces. Therefore Galatz was not an enemy's port, and the claimant had a locus sta2di in his denmand for restitution. This is the principal point of the case, and it has been decided by the Privy Council in consonance, as we think, writh humanity and common sense. The second point is of a more technical nature. Did the Gerasimo break a blockade ? The Privy Council decides in the negative. A blockade, it declares, was established, but only as a military expedient and for the euzbaiTassment of the Russian army. In the summer of 1854 the Russian forces were straitened for want of provisions. The allied Admirals wished to prevent the importation of corn up the Danube, and with that viewissued a proclamation, dated June 2, 1854, in Mwhicll they declared that they had established a blockade of the Danube " in order to stop all " transport of provisions to the Russian armies ;" and they apprized all vessels of every nation that "they would not be able to enter the river until "further orders." The Russians, on the other hand, forbade all export of cereals after the 2d of July. Any exportation was, therefore, to the prejudice of the Russians. " Could, therefore," ask the Judicial Committee, " a Moldavian merchant "imagine, if he had heard of this blockade, "that he was liable to capture by the allies "for exporting provisions, when the whole pur"pose of the blockade was declared to be to "prevent their import 9" Bloreover, there was no proof that the merchants of Galatz had ever heard of the blockade, since Galatz is some 150 miles from the mouth of the Danube. And if the vessel had no notice of blockade, she was, onI that general ground, entitled to bring out her cargo.
So the Gerasirno, the Aspasia, the Achilles, and. many another craft are decided to have been iUegaDy seized and sold; and their owners, lonians, Wallachians, or Sciotes, wiU come oni the British Admiralty for compensation. Certainly we seem to have made as many mistakes during the last war as could be crowded by any nation into the space of two years. It is of course natural that these seizures at the mouth of the Danube should be made by active naval officers very little burdened with maritime law, but one cannot help wondering that the Government did not take the trouble to be reasonably well advised on the matter. The attempt to support the seizure on the ground that Wallachia was Russian territory seems as irreconcileable vith common sense as with humanity_ The Privy Council has in both its judgments. extendcd the liberty of the trader and made a step in the emanCipation of neutral commerce. It is a question, however, whether the system can ever be placed on a satisfactory footing, except by the concession of that absolute immrulity which has been recently proposed to the -world.

PARIS, M-Aicu 25, 6 P.3L
At the meeting of the Conference on the Neuch,tel question held yesterday not much progress was made in business: it was merely for the purpose of taldng note of the propositions set forth by MX de Hatzfeldt. The Conference met again to-day, whea the Swiss Plenipotentiary, Dr. Mern, was at last admitted; he laid before the meeting the counterpropositions of his Government, which, as you are aware, differ essentially from those of his adversary. The public appears quite indifferent to this affair, and I suspect none are more sick of it than the Plenipotentiaries themselves. It may linger on for some days longer, but no one doubts that it will be settled by mutual concessions.
M. de Rayneval, the French Minister at Rome, is about to return to Paris on leave of absence.
A letter from Turin of the 23d announces the departure of General della Marmora, the Minister of War, for Genoa, to visit the Grand Duke Constantine, who had arrived there.
A letter from Nice says that the Grand Duke Constantine will accompany the Empress-Dowager of Russia to Rome. The Empress intends spending the holy week in the Eternal City. After the Easter festival the Grand Duke will visit Toulon, for the purpose of inspecting the port and arsenal, as also the Mediterranean squadron. He is expected at the end oi next month in Paris, where it is said a magnificent reception awaits him. I am assured that all that has been said about the journey of the Emperor Alexander to this country is completely without foundation.
The expedition to Kabylia has, it appears, been decided upon. Marshal Randon has left Paris for Dauphine to spend some days with his family before returning to Africa. General Trochu, who was severely wounded at the capture of Sebastopol, b has been appointed to a command in the expedition under Marshal Randon.
A Cabinet Council, at which the Emperor presided, was held yesterday at the Tuileries to consider the question of removing the prisoners confined in the penal settlement of Cayenne to a more healthy climate.
The Moniteur publishes the official return of the Customs' revenue for last month, which amounted to 13,987,439f., being an increase of 926,771f. on the receipts of the corresponding period of last year. A comparison of the proceeds of the first two months of 1856 and 1857 shows an increase of 3,625,675f. in favour of the latter, the amounts being respectively 24,165,876f. and 27,791,5511. The articles which show the greatest improvement arecoffee, 2,550,946f£; French colonial sugar, 334,033f.; oleaginous seeds, l06,262f.; pepper, 19,480f.; raw and spun silk, 14,364f.. hemp, 235,757f.; mahogany, 30,946f.; and wine, brandy, and spirits of wine, 1,088,007f.

A postal treaty has just been concluded between France and the UJnited States. By this treaty the French Government will pay the expense of transit of the Franco-American mails between France and England, and between England and America, by British packets. The American Government wiU pay the expense of transit of such mails between France and the United States by American packets, and between England and the United States by American packets. The postal offices of exchange between France and America will be Havre, the railway post-office between Paris and Calais, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The postage on a letter from America to France will be 4id. per quarter of an ounce, prepayment to be optional. The treaty will come into operation on the 1st of April.
The following is the ecoposa des motifs of the budget of 1858, lately presented to the Legislative Body. The document bears the signatures of E. Boinvilliers, President'of the Finance Section ofithe Council of State, and MM. Godelle and Vuitry, members of the same body:-
' Gentlemen, -We are about to submit to your examination the estimates of the receipts and expenses proposed for the year 185l. Last year at this period we congratulated ourselves, with you, on the hopes of an early peace. Peace has been signed, a glorious and lasting one, a work of wisdom and straightforward dealing; a new treaty of Paris, very different from the old one, and in which are written by the hand of France, and sanctioned by all Earope, great principles of humanity too long contested, and the rules, henceforth certain, of international maritime law. At the same time, Heaven gave a son to the Emperor and to France. To these great benefits of Providence we must respond by moderation and wisdom. The ensemble of the budget which we now submit to you is summned np, so to speak, in the words of the Emperor at the opening of your session :-' I have resolved to reduce the expenses without suspending great public works, without compromiaing acquired positions, and to diminish certain taxes without injuring the finances of the State. The budget of 1858 will be pre Fented to you in equilibrium; all the foreseen expenses have been set down in it. The amount of the loans wil uffice to pay the balance of the expenses of the war; all services maybe assured without our haing need to apply anew to pnblic credit.' As you know, gentlemen, the year 1856, which has just concluded, shows a notable augmentation in the produce of the indirect taxes and revenues, and yet the year 1855 was itself exceptionally producEive. The year 1855 produced 957,000,000f. In that sum new duties figure for 33,230,000f. for half a year. The year 1856 produced 1,033,000,090f., in which the new duties figure for 79,647,000f. for a whole year. You will remark, gentlemen, that the estimate of the receipts for tho year 1858 has been made with that prudent reserve which last year obtained your *pprobation. At the same time, to be consistent with ourselves, and to obey the wishes of the Emperor, we have inscribed in the budget all the foreseen expenses, and we have set them down at the true figure, as closely, at least, as it is possble to do with things to come.
" Suppression of the Second War Decino on the Regis. tration Duties.-The new war d6cime on the registration duties will be suppressed from Jan. 1,1858, which will be a relief of 23,000,000f.
" Abrogation of Article 1 of the Law of the 6th Prairial, An VII., and Suppression of the Stamp Duty on Printed Notices and Prospectuses.-Art. 1 of the law of the 6th Prairial, An VIL, is thus conceived:-' Printed notices, whatever may be their objeot, which are cried and distributed in the streets and public plcs, or which %ra put into circulation in any other manner, shall be subjected to a stamp duty, with the exception of addresses containing a simple indication of domicile or a simple notice of change of residence.' Although this duty was reduced by Art. 6 of the budget of the 28th April, 1816, which fixed it at lOc. for the whole sheet, at 5c. for half a sheet, and 2ic. for the quarter sheet, and at lo. for the half-quarter sheet, cards, and other papers of smaller dimensions, commerce and manufactures have not ceased for 15 years to de. mnand its suppression. It presents the inconvenience of being quite out of proportion with the value of the object taxed. It quadruples and even quintuplesthe price of printed papers; thus, restricting the employment of this useful mode of publication, it becomes an embarrassment to the devolopment of commerce and manufactures in general, and causesxa real and special prejudice to the printing trade. It is the objoct of numerous frauds, which, being exercised on a large scale, destroy the elements of just and honest competition, and favour, to the injury of honest manufacturers and traders, thoee who do not fear to disobey the law. The laws of the 25th March, 1817, and of the 15th Mav, 1848, whieh admitted exceptions to the law of the 6th Prairal, An VII*, gave rise to incessant difficulties
and to disputes as to the application of it. From 1837 to 185G the produce of that stamp duty did not exceed annually Y0,O00f.; from 1850 to 1855 it amounted to nearly 1,000,000ft But the suppresdon of it will not cause an equal loss to the Treasury. At Dresent it is only at the post. office that contraventions in this matter can be ascertained; and in most cases it i8 private enterprs which, especially in towns, are engaged in the conveyance and distribation of printed papers. From the) moment the samp duty sball be suppressed the poet-office, thankn to the reductions qg postage effected by the law of the 25th of June last, will resume it^Ajdvantages, and the Treasury will find in the postage a large coQmpensation for what it will lose by the stamp duty. TILe repeal of Art. I of the LAw of the 6tb Prairi, An VI., by removing a permanent cause of discontent, without ccasioningasensible prejudice to the Treasury, will give satisfaction to wants aring from the exten8ion of commerce and manufactures. We tbink that this measure will oVsin your approbation.
" Modifcations in the Law of June 5, 1850. -Increae in the. Duty on French and Foreign Transferable Se¢uri.
ties.-In oonformity with the Wish repeatedly expre6;ed by the Legialative Body, the Emperor bsa charged Us to propose to you to le'y a new tax on trnerable 8eoulties. The law of June 5, 1850, eablshed a proporeonal xsmp duty on the nlegoia l shar aMd bod of atcom.
panle. That ax Ws 5oc. Ier 100. on the nominal capital of the shiare, If 'he Iaron o the company did not exceed 10 years, and If. t it vas for a longer period. This proportional tax onoe paid, the share acquired under the law of 1850 a double advantage; it had no more stamp duty to pay during the whole continuance of the company, aud wan exempt during the same space of time from any formality of registration in case of trnfer. According to the provisions of that law, if the companies wished to avoid the payment of the proportional duty, they night enter into an annual subscription for the whole period of their duration. In that ease they would have to pay 5c. per 100f. of capital. Such is the general economy of the law of 1850. We continue to transferable securities all the advantages conferred on them by that law; but we propose to convert this proportional stamp duty, once paid, into an annual and obligatory tax of 15c. per 100f. of the real capital of the share. By that system the proportional duty on the issue will cease, and the subscription, which was before optional, becomes obligatory. Different considerations have induced us to recommend this plan to your serious examination. In the first place, it avoids the creation and the introduction into our laws of a new tax, which appears difficult and perhaps even dangerous. We find, besides, in a law already established the principle and ,the basis of the new duty to be
levied. In the second place, the annual stamp duty leaves I to transferable shares all their liberty, and does not in any way interfere with the different negotiations of which they are the object. MAintained, and ssit were embodied, in the law of 1850, it removes all reasonable fear of further increase. Simple and easy of collection and moderate in its amount, it will not in any way impede industrial progress, and its proceeds are destined to h3 increased only by the ldevelopment of the object taxed.
"Budget of Receipts.-The estimates of the receipts for 1858 has been made according to rules admitted last year, and approved by you. We have confined ourselves for this estimate within the limit of the receipts reall&ed in 1856, and the calculations] admitted by the budget of IW7. The taxes and indirect revenues on which this calculation is almost exclusively based stand In tho budget of 1857 for a £uin of 1,031,010,000f. We propose to you to admit them |in that of 1858 at 1,030,340,000f. We must add, that in
this total estimate account has been taken of a diminution of 24,000,000f., the causes of which are explained above, and also an increase of receipts of 14,000,000f., being the probable result of the now duty on transferable securities.
" Budget of Expenses.-The budget of 1858, as compared with 1857, presents an increase of expenses of 18,081,526f. Different causes have produced this considerablo augmentation; it will be sufficient for us to point out the prindpal ones. The Department of Finance claims for itself alone an inereased expenditure of 27,855,366L, in which amount are set down 5,000,000f. for the Transatlantic steampackets; 5,000,000f. for annual reimbursement to the Bank of France on the loan of 75,000,000f. made in 1848 (hitherto this annual reimbursement had been placed to the charge of the floating debt); 5,000,0001. for the increase of small salaries in different branches of tho Finance Department; 7,000,OOOf. for the reserves of the sinking fund; and the remainder for other expenses connected with the collection of the indirect taxes. The Department of the Marine receives an extraordinary grant of 11,251,299f., the inevitable results of the wear and tear of a war so nobly sustained, and also called for by the progress every day making in naval science.

The following are the articles of the budget which relate to the new duty on shares and bonds:-
" Art. 6. From the promulgation of the present biU the duties established by Arts. 14, 22, 27, and 31 of the law of June 5, 1850, on the shares and bonds of financial, commercial, and industrial companies are converted into a single obligatory duty of 15. per annum for every 100f. of the capital of the said shares and bonds.
" Art. 7. For companies created hereafter the duty shall be determined during the first three years with respect to shares according to their nominal capital, and with respect to bonds according to the rate of issue. For the years following it shaU be levied on the capital fixed every three years, according to the average price of the shares and bonds during the triennial period preceding. For companies establshed previously to the promulgation of the present law the duty shaU be levied, during the first triennial period, according to the average quotations of the three preceding years. If the company has naot been in existence three years, the average shall be determined on the period which has elapsed since its creation.
"Art. 8. The amount of the proportional duty paid, in virtue of Arts. 14 and 27 of the law of June 5, 1850, by companies established prior to the promulgation of the pre. sent law, shall be included in the duties which they will have to pay hereafter, in virtue of the preceding article.
" Art. 9. Shares and bonds issued by foreign companies shaU be subjected, like French, to a tax which shaU not exceed 15c. per 100f. per annum on their real value. A regulation of the public administration shall establish the proportion and the manner in which this tax shall be collected.
** Art. 10. The same regulation shall lay down all the necessary measures for the execution of the present law.
" Art. 11. Every contravention of this regulation shall be liable to a fine of from 501. to 3001."

CONSTANTINOPLE, MAucur 16.
Every one who has sailed up the Bosphorus will remember,on its Europeau bank, an elegant range of white buildings, supported by a graceful marble colonnade, with beautifully laid out grounds at the ba^k, on the slope of the overhanging hill; this was the Palace of Tcheragan, built by the late Sultan Mahmoud. Although the new Palace of Dolma Bagtch6, not half a mile lower down the Bosphorus, is scarcely finished, and not altogether p did for, the Sultan has ordered the demolition of Tcheragan, and its immediate reconstruction a little further in from the water, at an estimatedl cost of nearly 2,000,0001. sterling. 'He is also buying up, at any price, all the houses between the two palaces, about 100 as he means to connect the two by a garden. iWith the same intention, a barrack and a small-arm manufactory situated near the new palace have been leve led to
tne ground, although they were both new and in very good order. The Sultan's mania for building seems quite insatiable; all his predecessors were to some degree possessed in the samae way, but Sultan Abdul Medjid has far surpassed them all. He is at present constructing no less than ten new palaces or kiosks on all parts of the Bosphorus, and purchased besides only a short time ago the palace of the Armenim Allahverdi at Ortakioui, for the sum of 9,000,000 piasters, and is now trying to buy the adjoining houses to enlarge it. Some of these palaces are for himself, others for his two daughters, who have been betrothed, and are shordty to be married. The marriage ceremonies will take place at the same time as the ceremony of circuImcision of the sons of the Sultan, and it is intended to display great magnificence and splendour on this solemn occasion, to pay for which a loan of 30,000,000 piasters is now being negotiated in Galata. If the Sultan is allowed to continue this prodigal expenditure unchecked, it vill be a serious drawback on the unremitting efforts of the present Grand Vizier to improve the resources of the country and introduce order into its finances.
The Government has published a new regulation, to which all persons who own printing-offices or who are desirous of opening new ones in Constantinople or the provinces will in future be obliged to conform; it is based on the French laws in this matter, and reflects their illiberal principles. Before authorizing the publishing of any book or pampblet the Government will asaure iteolf by mature examina.
tion that it contains nothing against the interesth of the Ottoman empire or of foreign States, and that it ig not injurious to the public. A decree has also been promulgated on colonization, and is entitled-" Conditions arr6t6as par le Gouvernement Imp6rial an sujet de la colonisation en Turquie des familles qui, venant de Ietranger, desireraient s'y 'tablir en devenarit sujets de l'Empire Ottoman." On certain conditions stipulated in this decree the Government wiU grant lands in Roumelia or Anatolia to families anxious to establish themselves there, and who are possessed of the minimum capital of 60 gold medjidi6s, or 561. sterling; application for such grants to be made to the representatives and consuls of the Ottoman Government abroad. A certain number of the Poles of the ex-Polish Legion wiiU at once settle as colonists on the estates of Redschid Pasha in Thessaly on the terms of this decree; and, moreover,by a special contract with these, RedschidPasha has granted to them special advantages and priv'leger.
The commission appointed to inquire into the circumstances of the Polsh expedition to Cireassia has not yet reported; but in the meantime it has ordered the arrest of Ferhad Pasha (General Stein) and Ismail Pasha, a Circassian, and the director of the Turkish postal establishments, both of whom are supposed to have been active in organizing the expedition. The Kangaroo has returned, and brought down from the Circassnan coast 85 female passengers and 28 children. As there is little doubt that these women and children will mostly be sold as slaves in Constantinople, the English authorities were on the point of seizing the vessel for an infraction of the law against slavery, but it seems this infraction could not be proved.
Mr. D. Pevelaky, a Greek, for some years past a clerkinthe house of T. I.Black,of this town, and who lately was actively engaged in negotiating with the Porte for various concessions, and among others that of the Wilkins Bank,has been appointed by the Ambassador to act for the time bemng as first dragoman to the Embassy. It is supposed that this appointment will not be made permanent.
The Commissioners to the Principalities have a. left for their posts. Sir Henry Bulwer went last Wednesday in the screw gunboat Coquette, which wiiU leave him at Sulina; the smaller gunboat, Boxer, uow stationed at Susna, wiU take him up the Danube as far as Giurgevo, and from there he wiU proceed by land to Bucharest.
Acurious instance of how somethings are managed inTurkeyhas just occurred. To relieve the sufferings of the inhabitants of the island of Rhodes, victims of an earthquake and of the terrible explosion of a large quantity of gunpowder, the Sultan sent them a present of 400,000 piastres. In passing from hand to hand this sum was so reduced that only 18,000 piastres reached the island, and this sum was handed over to the primates to buy their silence, so that the sufferers for whom the money was intended got nothing at all. The story seems incredible, but is nevertheless quite true.

A few days since the Archduke Ferdinand MaxiniIian, the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venotian Kingdom, wzrote the subjoined letter to the Burgomaster of the city of Trieste:
"< Dear Podestb,-Being about to obey the orders of His Imperial Royal Apostolic Majesty, my most grrcions lord, and to leave for the Lombardo-VenetiAn Kingdom, I cannot refrain from giving to Trieste, a city in which I have passed six of the most agreeable years of my life, a slight token of my grateful sentimeuts.
"I herewith send the sum of 3,000fd., and request you to divide one-half of it among the most necessitous inha. bitants of the city, and to give the other half to the f and that owes its origin to an event which, although It was a severe trial,* afforded the city an opportunity of display. ing its attachment to me in a way that wvas at once affectionate and worthy.t
" The inhabitants of Trieste have never failed to display a kindly feeling towards me, and, as I attach a high value to that feeling, it affords me pleasure that my office of Commander-in-Chief of the Imuperial Navy will keep me in continual communication with the city. If in future my new duties should keep me absent during a longer period of the year, I shall always be glad to return, and to pass, with my fature consort, some happy days in the immediate neighbourhood of Trieste, in my castle of Miramare. The further development and increasing proeperity of a city which is so dear to me will always give pleasure to rmy heart.
" FERDINAND MAXETLIA. "Trieste, March 20, 1857."
The following letter, which is extracted from the Pesth LlyIJd, cannot but be acceptable to all those persons who take an interest in the fate of the Caucasian races:
"Circassian Head-quarters, Tuabs, Feb. 26.
"By means of the British steamer Kangaroo you will receive this letter, which will, perhaps, convey to Europe the first information of an event that may have very great influence on the future fate of the Circasslan nations. Itia known to you that Mehemed Bey (Bangya), to whose person I am attached, has acceded to the wishes of the chiefs and deputies of the Circassian tribes, and hgs accepted the post of Commander-in-Chief. On Monday, the 23d of February, we landed at Tuabs,4: where we have our head-quarters. Before our departure, Mehemed Bey engagged a couple of hundred excellent mlitary instractors for the different arms, and they accompanied us hither. Mehemed Bey has already been solemnly proclaimed General-in-Chief of all the Circassian forces. The princes, nobles, and deputies of the people have sworn on the Koran to obey him, and a deputation of the Circassian Diet has to-day sent in the flag of the Prophet, which is the symbol of the highest power. The enthusiasm was very great when the new commander awore fidelity to the sacred standard. (The flag itself is green, and on it is a white sword with the crescent and the star.)
"The excitement is great, and the Cireassians re resolved to obtain their complete indeendence or to perish in the struggle for it. It is expected that 150,000 (.) men will be in the field by the month of May. 'Iussia,' said Mehemed Bey to me just now, I will soon have an opportunity of convincing herself that a new spirit prevails. I know the materials which are plued at my disposal (Mehemed Bey was with the Circassians duang the fate war), and am of opinion that a nation which, without a military organiza. tlOn, could resist its enemy for 30 years, wlL, when pro-
erly organized, be able to achiereits complete inde;cedence.' on may expect to receive some impcortant news rm these mountains in the coming spring. You sall hhave from me as early information of what happens as our neans of communication wvill permit."

The state of trade at the port of St. Petersburg during the past year, showing the extent to which that port not only recovered, but also surpassed its commercial activity before the war, wiU certainly be of too great interest, particularly to your commercial readers, to require any lengthened exordium on my part, or apology for its introduction here.
In 1856 the total value of all articles imported was 68,871,752r.; of all articles exported, 54,926,091r. ; O1 the imports the most extensive were raw cotton, amounting to 13,452,029r.; precious metals, 9,343,672r.; raw sugar, 8,005,520r.; colours, 6,702,447r. ; sundries, 15,786,050r. Of the total amount of 68,871,752r., no less than 64,257,720r. was the value of goods imported by }Kussian merchans,b while the foreigners trading
tnere imported only to the aM-ount of 4,491,740r.
Of the exports the most extensive were grain, to the amount of 15,355,686r.; tallow, 11,445,920r.
sundries 14,762,035r.; and then the only article of any amount remaining to be mentioned is hemp, 4,100,458r. Of the total amount of 54,926,091r., the Russian merchants exported to the extent of 39,558,999r., while the foreigners trading there exported to the amount of 15,311,562r.
The total amount of Customs dues received at St. Petersburg and Cronstadt on the imports and ex-
ports of 1856 wras 9,7T00,73Sr.
The folowing totals of the exports cleared out at St. Petersbarg during the last four years will show
the efects of the war on that chief port of Russian trade, and its recovery after the peace:

of Russian exports that Great Britain takes, which teaches us at the same time the expediency of setting to work at once to obtain a good treaty of commerce with 'her, as soon as the tariff arrangements are concluded, and the necessity of providing ourselves during peace with other markets to buy in, so that we may be independent of her when politics require we should go to war with her. Of the 1,214,000 pouds of hemp which she exported in 1856, England took 820,800 pouds; of 636,400 pouds of flax, 598,800 pouds; of 2,574,121 pouds of tallow, 1,856,954 ; of 727,160 pouds of bones,

The navigation opened MIay 6th (N.S. 17th), and ws closed Nov. 22d (N.S. Dec. 4th). The total number of arrivals was 3,374; of these 1,176 camo in ballast; of the remainingb 2,198 vessels, 631 brought coals. Of the 430 steamers that entered that port last year, 155 came from England. The suddenness vith which the winter set in caused no less than 377 vessels to be blocked up in the ice at St. Petersburg and Cronstadt, against eight on the previous winter. The total number of arrivals at the port during 1856, as mentioned above, 3,374, shows, when compared with 1,921, that of 1853, the last year before the war, an increase of 1,453.
Additional light is thrown on Russian trade and navigation by a report on the craft that has passed the Sound during the last year, from which I extract the following:-

Amounting altogether to ... 20,530, being an Increase of 4,745 vessels on the preceding year, but a diminution of 228 on the number in 1853. Of those that entered the Baltic 2,485 brought cargoes for Russian ports, the most prominent element of which was raw cotton, amounting in aU to :l170,000 bales, of about 450 lb. Russian each; of these 170,000, there came 56,100 direct from the United States, 95,000 from England, 12,000 from liolland and Belgium, &c. Of those vessels that left the Baltic with Russian exports on board there were 4,183-viz., 1,901 from St. Petersburg, 1,581 from R1tiga, andthe rest from Wyborg, Varva, Liban, Revel, Pernau, &c. The Russianshlpping trade seems to have endeavoured in the past year to make up by increased activity for the losses it had sustained during the war, for we find that 194 Russian vessels, of which no fewer than 66 were built from 1855 to 1856, contrived ia the latter year to make 456 trips through the Sound. Last year's navigation of the Baltic has been remarkable for the great increase in the proportion of steamers, of which no less than 684 passed the Sound; 414 of them were English, 158 Swedish and Norwegian, and 7 Russian.

Thurstay Evening.
The English funds opened steadily to-day at the prices of last evening, and subsequently experienced an improvement of an eighth, the market presenting a favourable appearance, although money ia still in demand on Government securities at 6 per cent. Consols for money were first quoted 93} to i, and they left off at 93g to i for money, and 3, to I for the 8th of ApriL The next account is fixed for the 7th of May, and the latest transactions for that period were at 94*. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222, with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds, 98g to ;; India Bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills (March), par to 3s. premium.
Foreign stocks were rather firmer, but the highest prices were not in all cases supported. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were purchased at 98, and for the account at 98i, 98, 98 , and J. In Mexican transactions took place at 23. The other bargains comprised-Ecuador Consolidated, 14*i; Portuguese Three per Cents., 454 ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 90i to 91; Spanish New Deferred, 25e; the Certificates of Coupon, 6i: Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 991; Dutch'Two-and-a-Half per Cents, 65j ; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 99.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evenin were 70f. 25c. for money and 70f. 60c. for the end of the mouth, showing in the former case a further decline of a quarter per cent,, but scarcely any alteration in the latter.
About 75,0001. of bar gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation to the continent in payment for silver. It must be mentioned, however, that the effect of these constant withdrawals is partially counteracted by a gradual influx of sovereigns from Constantinople and other quarters.
The commercial history of each day seems to be little else than a record of the shanmeful mismanagement of our public compames. On Monday last there was an exposure of the Australian Agricultural, which, with a paid-up capital of 380,0001. and a free grant of nearly 700,000 acres of valuable land, has squandered all its immediate resources, the shareholders meanwhile being kept in profound ignorance. A few days previously, in connexion with the abandonment of the project of the London and Paris Bank-, a balancesheet was presented to the subscribers showing 14,4221 to have been expended by the directors in the mere introduction of that enterprise to the public, not a single step having been taken in the shape of an absolute commencement of business. Yesterday the theme was the London and Eastern Bank, which, having been established three years back to carry on banking and exchange transactions with India, with a paid-up capital of 250,0001., has contrived in that period to assist its own directors and manager with sums amounting in the aggregate to nearly 290,0001., and which is now obliged to announce to its shareholders the probable loss of their whole investment, with the possibility of their being called upon even for a further considerable contribution. The addition tothe list for to-day is furnished by the North of Europe Steam Company. About a month back The Times cautioned the public that there were unfavourable rumours regarding this undertaking which required investigation, although the great respectability of the directors seemed to preclude the possibility of there being anything really wrong. The result was that some of the largest proprietors waited upon the directors, and were solemy assured that, notwithstanding some inconvenience which had arisen from accidental causes, nothing had occurred to interfere with the permanent prosperity of the concern; that the large dividends paid had aU been honestly earned, and, of course, that there had never been anything more unjustifiable than the distrust suggested by The Times. It was added, moreover, that at the meetingof the company about to be held every detail would be entered into, and this favourable statement be fully confirmed. That meeting took place to-day, Sir Morton Peto in the chair, and the following is a narrative of the proceedings, from which it 'will be seen that the directors, like those of the Australian Agricultural Company, have perilled the enti property of their constituents by leaving it recklessly in the control of a single individual; that650,00Ql., or upwards, out oE a capital of 500,0001., has been lost in the course of a few months, without the beard having the slightest suspicion of the circumstance; and that the last half-yearly diXidend at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum was paid not only when there had been no profits, but actually while these ruinous proceedings were going on. The chairman commenced by adverting to the declaration of a dividend in July last for the previous six months without the presentation of accounts, these being made up annually. The distribution, which involved 13,0001, 'was made on the faith of a statement prepared bythe managing director, CaptainAndrews, showing for the half-year ending Midsummer a profit of upwards of 20,000l., and certified by Mr. J. E. Coleman. On that occasion Captain Andrews personally addressed the propretors, alluding to the position and prospects of the company, which he described as satisfactory, and it was then supposed that when the meeting took place, in January, there would be at least an equal if not an augmented dividend. Soon after Christmas the accountant of the company died, and it was found, notwithstanding every exertion, imposible to complete the accounts in time for the usual meeting in February. The directors, however, had no reason to believe bnt that the busines had been in afavourable position, and it was not until Tuesday, when the books were brought into partial order, that they and Mr. Coleman discovered the fact of a considerable loss on the operations of the year. Captain Audrews, the managing director, was incapacitated towards the close of the year through sickness, and, although previously apparently in the vigour of health, the disease from which he suffered had overthrown his intellect, and he was no longer responsible for his acts. In this state of things the best exertions had been made to prepare accounts for the shareholders, but at present they were incomplete, although Mr. Coleman had ascertained that the loss was at least 50,0001. Thiscircunistancehad taken the directors greatly by surprise, and, as Captain Andrews, in wrhomthe beard as well as the shareholders had placed great confidence, could not be appealed to, the directors proposed that a cammittee of shareholders should be appointed to co-operate with them in carrying out an examination of the accounts and investigating the state of the trade not only with regard to the past, but also the future. Vith respect to the position occupied by himself, the chairman stated that his original bolding in the company was 20,0001., but that, having confidence in the management of Captain Andrews and the position of the undertaking, hehad increased it to 60,0001. fully paid up. Consequently, if the shareholders had beendeceived, hohimself largely participated in the sacrifioe. The announcement of the loss occasioned great dissatisfaction, and several shareholders arraigned the conduct of the directors for the absence of the necessary vigilance, and also the neglect of ordinary arrangements, since the loss of the services of a manager and the death. of the principal accountant couldnototherwisehave thrown the company into such a state of inextricable confusion. In answer to questions, the chairman mentioned that of the fleet 14 vessels were employed, 3 under repair, and 10 unemployed, and that the weekly pay-sheet at Lowestoft amounts to 1401. A variety of interrogatories were put with
respect to the traffic arrangements, which were replied to, but it was suggested that it would be more desirable to allow a committee to take them into consideration. It was stated that the position of the share list is satisfactory, the majority being aU
aid up. A shareholder inquired if the last diviSend was declared, when there was in reality no profit. The chairman said he feared from what had since been ascertained that such would be found to be the case. Two or three proprietors then desired MIr. Coleman to explain how he came to certify to
the accounts. In reply he stated that the accounts I were regularly audited to December, 1855. Being made out annually, there was no balance-sheet prepared to the 30th of Juno, 1856. A statement of the earnings for those six months was, however, submitted to himself and the directors by Captain .Andrews, which showed, from the employment of vessels in the transport service and other sources, a total of about 24,0001., and upon that it was presumed a dividend absorbing 13,0001. to 14,0001. might be safely declared. The loes which has now accrued arises solely from the operations of 1856, and Mr. Coleman refused to place it at a nanimum of 50,0001., the whole of the accounts not having been finally completed. One shareholder oomplained
that tbe directors should have given so favourable an account after the warning uttered by The, Timu.
Solely on the representation of the Bosrd, who
stated- that there was no cause for alsnn, lie had doubled his interest in the undertaking. "The chairman asiredthe meeting-that the direct;&A'p to Tuesday were unacquainted with the los0 wluch was then shown by the progress made under,txe superintendence of Mr. Coleman with the books. Captain Andrews, whose talent and energy had received the approval of the directors and the shateholders by special votes, had been placed in a po d- tion of entire confidence, and the committee woild have the opportunity of probing the whole question, and of testing the capacity of the trade snd the position of the company. In co-operation with them the directors would at a future day be able to present a report with such recommendations as might appear consistent with the interests of the proprietors. After some further disussion it was agreed that a committee of six shareholders should be apPointed to investigate, with the directors, the situation of the undertaking, and Sir Morton Peto pledged himself that the report shall be circulated a week previously to the adjourned meeting. Out of the 14 vessels of the company at present employed 11 are chartered at remunerative rates, and he begged the shareholders and public to reserve their judgment and not to display unneoessary adarm pending the general inquiry.
The Board of Trade returns for the past month were issued this morning, and continue to show an extraordinary increase of our exports. Compared with the prosperous month of February last year there is an augmentation of 1,587,293M., or 2(0 per cent., while compared with the same month of 1855 the difference is 4,280,6241., or 85 per cent. Assuming that this trade has been conducted on legitimate principles to meet an actual demand ia foreign marketb,-a point upon which no material doubt has as yet been suggested,-it seems imposeible that the existing unfavourable tendency of our bullion balances can much longer prevaiL Our home conusmption of goods does not appear to be extravagant, and we have;*o unusna,y heavy commitments weighing upon uviR the shape of foreign loans or advances. The annexed table shows the exact increase or decrease of our exportations under each head, and it will be observed that the only item of any importaut amount on the adverse side is again that of cotton yarn, which would imply merely that foreign manutacturers are less active than our own. It must be borne in mind with regard to the subjoined amounts, however, that in some cases the increase is partly due to a rise in the price of the raw material -
rr TVI regara lo unported commodities, a decreae is shown for the first time during a considerable period in the arrivals of wheat, flour, and rice. Salted provisions ahow an increase, but in the consumption of cocoa, coffee, and tea there has been a falling off owing, as respects the latter, to the dealers holding back for the reduction of duties. Sugar, wines, spirit, tobacco, spices, and fruits have been largely taken.
Subjoined are the quantities of provisions, &c., imported and taken for home consumption:
The following are the comparative imports and expots of raw material, showing an extraordinary increase in silk!
The miscellaneous imports exhibit an augmentation as regards dyes and dyeing stuffs, hides, leather manufactures, and timber. Copper and iron figure for a decrease, and other metals for an increase. Olive and palm oils again show a decrease, and other descriptions an increase.
At a meeting of the Ottoman Bank, held to-day, Mr. Laysrd in the chair, the dividend declared was at the rate of 1 5s. per share, or 10 per cent. per annum, and the report and accounts were unani mously adopted. It was stated that business Is making satisfactory progress, and that establishments have been opened at Constantinople, Galatz, Smyrna, and Beyrout. Already a beneficial influence has been exercised upon the native population, wbo have freely availed themselves of the advantages offered by the English system of banking; and even the Greeks, originally strong opponents, have become cuwtomers. The chairman detailed the negotiations opened for the formation of the National Bank ef Turkey and the acceptance of the concession by Messrs. lVilkins, and urged that if success should attend the efforts of those engaged in its organization it will not injure other establishments, as it must stand in the same relation to them as thae of the Bank of England and the Bank of France to other banks in those respective countries. Several shareholders made inquiries respecting the selection of auditors, and it was stated that immediately the deed, which has only just been received from the Treasury, shall have been signed, and other arraugements perfected, a special meeting will be called for the appointment of those officers. Provision is also made for the periodical retirement of one-fourth of the directors, wvho are, howrever, eligible for re-election. ,iiited liability to the extent of double the capital is secured by the Royal charter, and no advances have been made to directors or officera. It was suggested that branches should be opened at Aleppo and Damascus, and the chairman said those localities have not been lost sight of, but that the directors are desirous of exercising caution in their early career. Reference in the course of the proceedings was made to the startling disclosures at$e meeting of the London and Eastern Banking company, the Board being enjoined not to entertain doubtful adventures for the sake of inordinate profit. Special votes of thanks -were passed to the chairman and directors, the shareholders expressing entire confidence in their =anti ement.
At an adjourned meeting tod-y of the credi ona of Iessrs. Copland and Barnei, provision con raetors, who failed on the 6th inst., it wa agreed to wind up the estate through a petition for private arrangement, under the control of tho BhjEruptc

A mee'ting of the Canada Company took place torday for the re-election of retiring directors, and the presentation of a report of progress, from which it appeared that from the 1st of January to the 6th inst. the disposals of land have been 3,684 acres, at = average of 47s. 9d. per acre, against 2,853 acres, at 43s. 6d., during the corresponding period of last year. It was also stated that 27,338 acres have leen converted to freehold by the lessees, at an Average of 17r., against 23,481 acres, at 15s. 9d., in the corresponding period of 1856. The receipts show atotalof 38,7111. against 31,5501. The funds in hand in London are 38,1581., and the liabilities 2,8851.
The Committee of Spanish American Bondholders have transmitted a copy of a communication addressed to them by Messrs. Baring, Brothers, and Co., announcing the receipt of 2,2181. 15s. on account of interest on the debt of Buenos Ayres, and forwarding a copy of a letter received from the Finance Minister of that republic. This letter is lengthy, but, with the exception of the following paragraphs, it merely expresses the inability of the Government to cornply with the modifications requested by the bondholders in the conditions of the recent treaty for the arrangement of the debt:-
" Respecting the assigning of the canon enfleutico of the public lands to the Payment of the engagements to be entered into with thebondholders by the present arrangesnent, my Government does not deem it inexpedient to agree that the said 'canon' be specifically assigned to tho paymenn of the interest and redemption fond for the Active and beterred Bonds, for the whole amount of those bonds, any deficiency thereof to be made good from the other revenues of the State, it being understood that from the said I canon' there is to be reserved a num not to exceed 15, 0001. for the liqutidation of the still outstanding classified debt; and likewse what is owing and collected henceforth of the proceeds from the respective lands of the country towns apportioned by the law to the respective municipalities.
" Lastly, with regard to the principle of the sinking fund for the Deferred Bonds, and to the cancelling and depositing of all the purchased or redeemed bonds, the Government coincides entirely with the views and suggestions expressed in your letter.
" After these candid explanations, and the proofs which my Government has already given to the bondholders of its earnest desire to settle satisfactorily and equitably their claims, and offering at the same time guarantees for the punctual fulfilment thereof, the Government trusts that you, in behalf of the said bondholders, will not hesitato to consider as adjusted and agreed the bases of the settlement in the manner proposed by my Government, in order that the said Government may be placed in a condition to present itself to the hon. Legislative Chambers (who meet ox the 1st of May next), soliciting the competent authorization for the final completion of the arrangement, that it may be cArried into immediate execution, remitting to the bondhelders the monthly amount that may have accrued for the present year.

TO THE EDITOR OF THEB TIMES.
Sir,-On a subject so important as the supply of water to extinguish fires in this metropolis I am sure I shaLU not appeal to your columns in vain.
un Sunday evening, the 15th inst., a fire broke out in the extensive drain-pipe and terra.ootta works of Messrs. Doulton, High-street, LAabeth. For nearly an hour after the discovery of the fire water could not be obtained from the mins, otherwise it could have been kept within very narrow limits-the powerful engine from Messrs. Hodges distillery andplentyof hands being on the spot imrmediately after the outbreak. When water companies go to Parliament to obtain their powers, they hold out, as one of the chief inducemnents to the Legislature to grant them, their determination to afford a constant and *bnndant supply of wvater to extinguish fires, bnt when the timo corneae they are frequaently found sadly wauting, and the in,surance companies and others are made to
In this case the damage, which has been considerable, would have been very trifling had the supply been at al in proportion to the pretensions of the Lam heth Watervrorks Company.

COOR} V. TODD.-JUDGHME.
(BefOr thc LOAD QLAXOM-1 0o1.)
i11s was an appeal from a decree of the Master of the RoDs respecting the construction of the will of John Blagrove, dated in February, 1824. The testator thereby devised certain plantations and estates to trustees upon trust (inter calta)to pay out of the rents and profits unto his grandson Henry John Coore, the annual sum of 300L so long as he should be under the age of 25 years, and to pay to his grandson Richard John Coore, after he should have attained the age of 25 years, the annual sum of 4001. during his life, and to every tenant in tail in possession of the estates 150 a-yea-r during his minority. The testator then declared tbat, subject to the trusts aforesaid, his trustees should stand possessed of the -said plantations and estates for his said grandson Henry John Coere, after attaining 25 years of age, during his life, with remainder to his sons in tail, with a power to his grandson to charge the estates with a jointure of 3001. a-year in favour of any woman with whom he might intermarry. llenry John Coore entered into possession of the estates, rnarried, charged them with the jointure above mentioned, and died, leaving at widow and a posthumous son. The rents and profits of the estates were insufficient to pay In full the 4001. a-year to Richard John Coors, the 3001. ointure to the widow of Henry John Coore, and the 1501. annuity to the infant tenant in tail; and the question r-:aised hy the suit wlras whether either of the annuities were entitled to prorit or were all to abate in proportion. The lIa ster of the Rolls heldthat there ought to be equality among the several parties, and that they must take their annuities pro reag; and from this decision the plaintiff appealed.
Mrz. Lloyd and Mr. lalder were for the plaintiff; Mr. B. Palmner, Mr. Haynes, and Mr. MS«ckeson for the different defendants.
TheLosD CHAxcELLoir, after going through the will said that the question was whether the testatorintended the 4001. aunuity to his second grandson to be paid in priority to the jointure of 300Z. to the widow of his eldest grandson, and to the 1501. a-year maintenance for his great-
andson, the infant tenant in tail. The Master of the Colls held that all the annuitants ought to be paid rateably, and, after great doubt, he (the Lord Chancellor) had come to the same conclusion. It had been forcibly argued that the testator could never have intended that the 4001. &-year ghould be paid in ful out of the life estate of his eldest grandson, and yet should abate after his death withthe jointure to such eldest grandson's widow. This certainly appeared to be an anomaly, but there existed many reasons for supposing that the testator intended all the charges to be placed on the same footing, the chief of which was the direction irn his will that the surplus rents and profits of the estates were to be taken subject tothe jointure. This direction placed the jointure in tne same position as all the other annuities, and it was not inconsistent to hold that the testator, had he contemplated a deficiency, would have directed the life estate of his eldest grandson to be subject to the annuity of 4001. to his second grandson, and that such annuity should afterwards abate pro rat4 with the first grandson's widow. The decree of the Court below would therefore be in substance affirmed; but, as it was necesary to make an alteration in Itto giveeffect touch construction, the costs of all parties would comeout of8thelestate.
ZIOT V. I=R.-JlDG3M T.
This was an appeal from an order of Vice-Chancellor Stuart holding that certain deeds executed by the late Catherine Cumming, after she had been declared a lunatic, were vlid. The question arose under a reference to the chief clerk to ascertain what real estates the said Catherine Cunming died seised of. It appeared that Mrs. Cumming was tenant for life of certain copyhold estates under a settlement made in the year 1776, and that her two daughterm, Mrs. Ince and Mrs. HIooper, would now be entitled to such estates as tenants in tail, if such entail had not been barred by Ms. Cumming. In May, 1846, Mrs. Cumming was found by inquisition to be of unsound mind, and the deeds cutting off the entail were executed by her in the month of March, 1847. 31rs. Cumming diedin the year 1853, having, howFever, previously obtained leave from this Court to traverse the inquiisition. The Vice-Chancellor held, reversing t'he certificate of the chief clerk, that hlrs umnming died seised of the estates in fee, accordin,g to the custom of the manor. *The appeal of Mrs. Ince from that decision was heard som e timne back.
Mr. Bacon, Mr. Walker, lr. Cairns, Mr. Burdon, and Mr. Mforris were the counsel in the ase.
The Lotn CA OmRon now delivered judgment, and said the question to be determined was what effect was to be given to certain aets and deels done and executed by Mr.CGummning in the year 1847. Previous to that time Mrs. Cumnming had been decLared by inquisitionto be of unsound mind, and therefore. prmi frcie, she was at the 'time of executing the deeds a lunatic. It had, however
been urged that a lunatic was formerly competent to le'; a fine, and therefore the disentailing deeds in question being of a similar character, were valid. aThe whole of this argument depended upon a fictica in law, that a fine was a judicial proceeding. That fiction was now at an end, and a disentailing deed must be regarded in a very different light. The other branch of the plaintiff's case was that the Coult ought to uphold the deeds, as they operated for the benefit of the lunatic. This argument was not sustainable, for, in the first place, there was nothing to prove that the deeds were beneficial to Mrm Cummnin; and secondly, it had not been shown to be the doctrine a this dourt to inquire whether an aet done by a lunatic was or was not for his benefit. His Lordship then reviewed the varous cases cited, and said there was no principle or authority to warrant this Court in sayng that the acts done by MrsC.umming while of unsoud mind could alter the provisions of the settlement of 1776. With regard to the objection that Mrs. Lnce and
rs. llcoper wrere estopped from laying any claim to the estates by reason of certain acts already done by them the answer was that they had not, and as married women could not bar their rights. The judgment of the Court below must be reversed; but, as Mrs. Cumming had in her lifetime obtained leave from this Court to traverse the inquisition, the case would stand over until the first day of next term to give the plaintiff an opportunity of applying for an issue to tr whether Mrs. Cumming was of UnsoUnd mind at thhe time she executed the deeds.

Th'Is was an adjUourned summons, and came into court upon an application by the sheriffs of Middlesex that pub.. licatlon in the cause miglht pass forthwith, or at suchi time as the Court might think proper, in order that the appi cents might get dismissed from the suit, with which they had, no concern, and their connexion with which bad the effect of keeping their accounts open since 1849, when they were enjoined from taking out execution upon a judgment. The proceedings, were of a very, painful natuire, and the plaintiff, Mrs. Henniker Wilson, hatd obtained a decree fromthe late VioeeChancellor of England, setting up a deed of separation, and toat had been affirmed on appeal both by the Lord Chancellor andl the House of Lords. The defendant, Mr. Wilson, then gave a bond to a person de. scrbing herself as a progtitute, and confessed judgment upon it, 'whereby she was enabled to issue execution on the sepa. rate estate of the wife, and the injunction was obtainiel aganstth shrifs or roeedng unerthat judgmene.

'Mr. GIn'ARn, for the plaintiff, stated the circuLmstances with reference to the execution, and said that the evidence as to the plaintiff was wholly immaterial ; the defendant h'ad ipnt irn an answer of the most extraordinary description, not signed by counsel, nor had his solicitors any haudm it. He had hicmself personally examined partied before the examiner, and especially the present Attorney.

M1r. GLASS, for Mr. Wilson, said that the application now made ouaeht to have come froiR the plaintiff; the sheriff were kept here as pawns, and it was difficult to see why they were made defendants. There was no applica.. tion to discharge the order, and the plaintiff arowed that she would not be examined.
Mfr. Gnm= was heardl in reply.
The Vzc.u-Cua.cAr.uon thought that the order as to enlargiiig time, so far as regarded them, was wrong ; but the Court could not grant the app lication in its present form.
There must be a motion either to discharge the order, or. that the time for closing evidence might be fixed, anda that the'sheriffs might be dismissed, with costs. If that had been the form now, his Honour would have granted it, for all he had now heard. He declined to enter into any other quiestion, and to have the plaintiff examined before him unnecessrily ; she was bound by the order of the Court.

'Tho VIOBER.CwILonrO this morning gave judgment in this aew, which involved a, question of some importance The late Sir Gilbert AfIll.k beig second tenant for life Iu
Irm derofcetWin real sstates,with a power, when he should be in possession thereof, to appoint to his wife for her life byway of rentcharge an annual sum not exceeding 301. for *ve 1000!. received by bira with her as her partion, nd settle on younger children, and having, on his mamage with the plaintiff, received a portion of 10,000i . with her, which was settled on their younger children, entered into a covenant on that occasion that if be should come into possession of the before-mentioned real estates he would immediately thereafter appoint to his wife for her life a rentcharge of 3001., pursuant to the above power. Sir G. ASleck afterwards came into possession of the estates, and he was at that period and thenceforward up to his death in a shte of mental incapacity. The question ws whether the covenantconld be enforced as a valid execution in equity of the power. The case was argued in December last.
Mr. Cairs and Mr. Kaslake were for the plaintiff; and Mfr. Wigrara, Mr. Ialins, and Mr. Sehomberg for the do- fendant, who was now in possession of the estates.
The VIcx-CErcLoR. The plaintiff. as widow of the late Sir Gilbert Afleck, seeks by her bill to recover a jointure of 3001. as being well charged on certain real estates by her late husband's covenant in their marriag settlement. The question is whether tbis covenant is such an execution of the power of jointuring in the will of Sir James AfMleck as entitles the widow to the assistance of the Court to enforce it. Some time after the marriageand execution of the covenant, and before he came into psses sdon of the estates, Sir Gilbert Afflock fell intoa statoof decay and incapacity, mental and bodily, which continued til hi
death, and made him incapable during his possession of the estates of executing any deed of appointment of the jointure pursuant to the power and his covenant. The power of Jointuring in the will of Sir James Affleck authorized his nephew, Sir Gilbert, the second tenant for life, when he shouldbe In possession of the estates, or anypart thereof, to grant and appoint for the use of any womnsLr with whom he might intermarry, for hev life, any annual smn (by way of reutchrge and in lien of dower) not exceeding 301. for every 1,0001. which he should receive with such wife as her
rthon, but such jointure not in any case to exceed Q ., but with the express condition that the portion should be settled in the names of trustees for the benefit of younger children. The testator died in the year 1833, upon which Sir Robert Aflecl, the father of Sir Gilbert, became entitled to the estates in possession as first tenant for life, with remainder to his son, Sir Gilbert, as next tenant for life in remainder. In 1834 Sir Gilbert, while still tenant for life in remainder, rmarried the plaintiff, who had a portion of 10,000l. By an indenture of settlement madepreviously to the marriage, and dated the 2d of December, 1834, the plaintif's portion of 10, 000. was settled upon the yonnger childrenof the marriage. This settlement contained a covenant by Sir Gilbert that if he should come into or be entitled to the possession of the estates, then, and immediately after he should so become entitled to exercise the power, he would by proper deed grant and appoint to the plaintiff during her life a rentchage of 3001 by way of jointure, pursuant to the power in the wi On the 7th of May, 1851, Sir Gilbert became entitled to the possession of the estates, There was no child of the marriage. A deed, dated the 23d of May, 1851, Iprepared pursuant to the power and the covenant, was on that day executed by Sir Gilbert. But his incapacity at that time and during the remainder of h life has been safficiently proved. He died in 1854 The right of the plaintiff, therefore, must depend on the covenant in the marriage settlement of 1834, executed before Sir Gilbert was in possession of the estates. It is not disputed that the covenant of Sir Gilbert, although executed by him as a remainderman, and before his right to the pession had accrued, would have been enforced in equity against him when he came into possessionif he had continued of sound mind. The case of "TJackson v. aJckson " (4 Bro. C.C., 462) and other authorities bave establshed the right to equitable relief. Lord Redesdale, in "Shannon v. Brad9treet" (1 Schb and Laf, 63),
eahing of powersof jointure, says, "It hasbeen determined thatacovenantisa suficientdeclaration of intent to execute even when made before the power arose, as where a poweris
imited to be exercised by tenant for life in possesnon, and he covenants that when he comes into possession he will execute; in all these cases courts of equity have relieved." This was not disputed by the defendant. But it was argued that having capacity to execute the power when in possession of the estate was of the essence of the power, and that the Court would not interfere where the intention of the creation of the power would be violated, nor aid a defective execution before the power arose where the donee of the power was wholly incompetent to execute during his possession of the estates which was the time fixed at which the right to exercise the power was to accrue. This argument seams not consistent with the principle on which relief is given on the covenant to exercise the power where that covenant is entered into before the time when the power is to come into operation. The Court acts on the principle that the covemant, as a defective execution of the power, affects and binds the land as soon as the time arrives at which the covenantor has authority to bind the land. The operation of the covenant is Independent of any neglect or refasal or subsequent act of the covenantor. As to the intention of the teshtor who created the power, he probably contemplated that the -tenant for Efe should have a capacity to receive and -njoy the rents as well as a capacity to execute the power. Btt if the covenant is to have any effect at ali it operates from the moment of its execution. When the eovenantor came into possession of the estate, if the covenant bevalid,it is in itself such an execution of the power as will ho made good by the ettled rules of the Court, and therefore the capacity or incapacity of the tenant for life to execute any further deed seems an unimportant circumstance, if the charge created by the covenant attached to the lands. The authorities show that no further act or consent of the covenantor is necessary to create the charge. The covenant itself can be enforced against the land, even if he refused to make it good. The consent necessary to make the charge vahd is considered as sufficient by his covenant, and the manifestation of consent at the date of the covenant before he was in possession makes his absolute dissent and refusal after he comes into possession of no avail. But if a previous covenant by a person of sound mind operates as a charge upon the estate as soon as the covenantor comes into possession, so as to prevail against his subsequent actual dissent or refusal, it must equally prevail against any subsequent mental Incapacity. Having the power and capacity to execute is of the essence of the power just as much as a will and intention to execute-p.s much and no more. The same principle, therefore, which gives effect to the covenant as an execution, although a defective execution, of the power against a subsequent want of will and intention, must give effect to it against a subsequent want of capacity. In both caseseffect Is giventothecovenant ss avahdinstrumentbinding the estate, without reference to any subsequent want of consent orcapacityon the part of the donee of the power. The Court iS bound to give it assistance and enforce the charge not merely because the covenant is duly execated, bnt be cause it has been executed in consideration of money re ceived ad in favour of a wife who contracted a marriage on the faith of that covenant.

PRI55TLE v. HIOTATII.
The Exof.Cc qetion gave juwdgment in this case, the facts of which were reported in sie Timed a few days since, and were shorUy thee e:-Thetestator in the cause made a codicil in these words:
Wherea, sin te hthe makining esomytwig.toam ssPiest e.thewhomnhaducioneueted£20 the plaiti toeu sralieap I therefore t heb
revoke that le,acy, and m leu ereof I gve and beoueath to him, the raid Janles Prbeytle, in cuae be emaond iniustralia, or outof tais tingdom, £6t0, to beald to him la mouths after the decease of my qucaib so him4 the fuzrther sum cff £400 (making ;£5,0),tehilastb £ not to be paidtill 12mouths aftertheodeceaseof my wife."
T,he legatee James Priestley, who a e in Australia at the death of the testator, was proved to have sailed from E elbourne in the ship Madagascar, which has never since been heard of. The question was whether the ansimus r-eveitendi, which had thus been frustrated by the act of Providence, was a suflicient compliance with the terms of the codicilto entitle him to the additional legacy of 4001.
His HoNouR said that he had delayed giving his judgment, inthe hope of finding something to assist the constrction uged by the plaintiff as the representative of the legates, but he had been unable to do so. The condition annexedby the testatorwas a conditionprecedent,-namelyy the returnof the leate "to England," and there wvas nothng in the shape of a recital or otherwise on the face of the codiCil to r ow any reason for this condition which could help the plaintiff's case. The "return to England" mnust be construed to mean an actual return, and that not having been performed the claim must faiL.

His HoNouie also delivered judgment in each of the above cases, none of hich, howvever, presented any feature of public interest.
DAVIS V. AnRAtAa.
His HoNou then proceeded writh this part-heard case, which was a claim filed by Mtr. Sackville Davis, a solicitor, for the specific performance of a contract for the sale to him by the defendant of certain leasehold property belonging to him, the performance being resisted on the alleged grounDa that the relationship of solicitor and client existed between them at the time of the contract, and that the sale had been made at a great undervalue, the defendanit being at the time in circumstances of great embarrass-
r. Willcock and mr. Lovell were for the plaintiff; Mr. Daniel and Mr. Soutbgate for the defendant.
His HosoU, without calling upon the counsel for the defendant went minutely into the case made by the evidence, ana beld that, although the relationship of solicibor and client did not appear to have been established before the contract was really signed by the defendant (and, indeed, there seemed to have been on the part of the plaintiff a careful attempt not to put himself into the position of solicitor to the defendant until after it had been signed),
yet the bargain that had been made was undoubtedly; snatched bargain, and, although the Court might absol'e the plaintiff from wishing to do anything positively improper, his claim could not be sastained. The defendant, thou. gh undoubtedly wishing to seU the property, had evidentyy, no more idea than a child of hig legl position, and had first jarrelled with his family solicitor, and had not had the advantage of any solictor to protect him in his bargain with the plaintiff- moreover the plaintiff, choosing to become the purchaser, bad offered Iegal advice and information to the defendant as to his rights, the result of that information being that the nature of and title to the property were such as to make it improbable that he would find any but a professional man to buy it-a representation which (his Honour observed) there was nothing in the state of the property to 3ustiLy. If the ease had depended on the faWt of the plaintiff beinr a solicitor, and a vendor simply proposing to sell, then the inade q of price would not have beent sufficient to set aside the conhtact, But the case wat Tery different to that, and the circumstances were sach a to make it impossible for this Court to give the plintiff specific performance
Twhis ease afforded another Illustation of the speedy admiistration of justice in the Court of Chancoery under the new practice. The contraAct was made in January, the claim filed in Febrary, and a decree made (in a most hostile suit) on this the 26th day of Mairch,

From 300 to 400 people surrounded us, and tore his things off, the prisoner saying that he wan innocent, and atthat time he had neither sack nor bag.
Geore White, 16 a wood-chopper in Turk street Bethnal.green, said,-i saw the prisoner to-day, between U and 1, on the ruins -with a bag on his shoulder, from which, opposite the church, he turned out seven or eight eats. They al moved; some raied their heads, and others their legs. Itouched one and it was quite wwarm a portion of the skin had been left upon the paws. HTe was then walking away, but I raised a cry and a number of boys followed him! andI seized hold of him, but wsnot man enough to bold him. I therefore snatched the bag ay from him and he ran off again. I followed him, and he threatened to give me In charge for stealing his bag I found the sldn of a at in the bag, and afterwards put the cats into tha bag off the ruins. I never saw the prisoner before. I hung to him, and he flung me down, but other boys pulled off the skirts of his onat.
George Macintosh, a painter.-I saw the prisoner turn the cats out into a heap of dust. They were raw and skinned; they moved and got on to their legs, but then fell down n. I saw the prisoner one day last week turn out two or three other cats on the ruins, but they were all dead.
Edward Maynard, fringe-weaver.-On Monday week I aw the prisoner shoot out 10 cats on to the ruins, but not exactly in the sme place; there ws only a little skin left npon the pawa of each. I asked himwFhat he did itfor, and! he said he ws double-ruptured or he would not have done it, and that he had been in Guy's HoepiteL. He then pretended to be deaf. I and the other boys made him put them again into his bag. and he took them away.
Police-constable 93 N.-The prisoner was handed over to me, surrounded by about 500 people. He admitted the ck belonged to him, and when told the nature of the charge he made no answer. I found a clasp-knife on him. A quantity of cats' hair ws on his back from carrying the bAg. (The be here produced, containing a cat's skin and sax eats' bodies, stated by the officer to have evi. dently been just killed.)
The prisoner, in a wilc, excited tone, said,-I am a camel's hair brushmaker by trade, and have seen better days, but now support myself as wleU as I can. I am married, anct my wife, I suppose, is now out selling good;, but trade is very bad. Do you suppose I would do such a thing as this after living for 12 yeas in the neighbourhood ? Why, I should never be able to look any one in the face again. r was paaBing the ruins, looking for anything I could And, and I did pick up the skin foond m my bag, thinking it was a rabbit-skin. Any one might see that the cats had been lin about for a long time. Some one put them into myba
tr. Christie, the overseer, said,-I have known the prisoner for xix or eight weeks about that neighbourhood, and always thought he was gathering bones or rags. A number of cats are found there. and, there being a national school there, it is really a fas-increasing nuisance. I have seen as many as 50 cats lying there at one time.
Alderman, the gaoler.-The skins are disposed of to the German furriers living there. I know many inhabitants of the Hackney-road who have lost very valuable cat&
h[r. HAmi.-One really does not know how to deal with such a case as this; it is positively monstrous that such atrade should becarried on. (To the prisoner.)-Your manner is very extraordinary, and it is per4aps a charitable wish of mine that you may be found not exactly right in your mind. I shl remand you for a week, and during that time you will be examined by a surgeon, who will report to me, and tho polioe must prosecute an inquiry into the whole matter.

Thopointof the blade touched his breast; had not witness moved back and warded off the knife he must have been killed.
The woman with whom the prisoner cohabited gave evidence astohisiglusge and threats to murderher and her children. He was in the habit of iMtreating her.

Dinger, a police-constable, No. 182 K, said he was sta. tioned on a bank at the side of the North London Rallway, at Bow, and saw the prisoner and another boy throwinug stones on the line. Soon afterwards a train passed, and he saw the prisoner take a stone from his pocket, and delbe. rately hurl it at the carriages, which were full of passengers.
Mr. YARDL,EY.-Did the stone hit any of the carriages?
The Policeman.-I don't know, Sir, but it foll on the line.
Mr. YARDLEY.-HOw far was this boy from the railway? Dinger.-Not more than 20 yards, Sir.
The prisoner, in defence, said another boy threw stones at the carriages, and he (the prisoner) had some stones in his pockets, and threwy them away.
Mr. YAItDLEY.-ArO you sure that you saw him throw a stone at the carriages, policeman ?
Dmnger.-I am quite certain of it, Sir.

He was, however, enabled to cry out and bring the police to his assistance, and the prisoners were secured. It was stated by the constables that the prisoners were the constant associates of notorious thieves, and were freuently seen prowling about in search of persons the worse for liquor, with the view of robbing them. They were fully committed for trial.

Wctorc Mr-. JuiCT WILLIAS
Gordion Trevanioa Chadwick and Joseph uick 'were in.
dicted for a burglary in the dwelling-house of the Rev. M. N. Peters, at Mawnan, on the 24th of July, and for having stolen a large quantity of plate and other articles, his property.
hlr. Stock w.d Mr. Hodges were counsel for the prosecutor; and Mr. Cole defended the prisoners.
It appeared that the house of Mr. Peters vas locked ip about o'clock on the night of the 23d of July, when the family went to bed. The next morning, at 5 o'clock, the groom came downstairs, aed he observed the pantry door open, and in tltat pantrytbe greaberpartof the plate was kept. As alterations were being tuade m the house, the groom iuiagined thatthe carpenters niglit hare left the door of the antry open, and he thereforedid not alarm tha house.
hen t other servants came down they found that a large ,quantity of plate, to the value of 2001., had been taken eway; and it was found that some one had entered the house throughi a new window, which had not been glazed. 'Pe pantry door had been broken open, and there were the marks of a chlsel on the door and posts. Some plate had also been taken from the d.ningroom and drawing-room. 'wo guns had elso been taken. There were several footmarks about the premises, and a chisel was found. All sorts of inquirtes wereseton foot, and in Septembertheprisoners were apprehended, and the witnesses were brought forward, and -a man named Spargo said he had seen a man in the nei"hbourhoodof Mr. Peters's house about 4 o'clock on the morning of the 24th of July, as he was going to his work as a mason. 3 e had a gun with him. Lost sight of him for a short time aud then he saw two men, but they had no gun. They were in a field. They got over a hedme One of them had a " bravish" paroeL Spargo askea them what they were doing there. One of the men, who was Chadwick, said they had lost their road. Spargo said, "Here's the parish road
longhside of you." Chadwick said he wanted to know Stythian's road to PenTyn. Spargo pointed it out to him. Spargo asked where the gun was which he had seen 'with them. Chadwick said they had no gun with them. Spargo said they had it a minute before, and they had better be gone from there or they might get into it about the rabbits. Spargo then left them. Tbis was near Orpy's copse. In cross-examination Spargo said he knew it was the 24th of July because his fatherhad looked at the amIanac some time after. He had told his fellow-workmen ,what he had seen the same day. He was found out by the constable on the 3d of September, when the prisoners were before the magistrates. He had neverseen Chadwick before that morning. The marks on the door corresponded with a chisel which was found near the bouse the norning of the robbery. That chisel had belonged to one D)onnell, who was a carpenter at a mine where Chadwick lad acted as a watcher. It was a common width chiseL Donnell missed this chisel about the middle of July. The tools were kept in an open shop to which all the men had access by (lay. On the 27th of August some silver plate 'was found in Orpy's-copse. The evening before that one Jenkins and the prisoner Chadvick were at the Masons' Arms, near this copse. Jenkins bad been charged with receiving the plate, but had absconded from his bail. They inquired for Stythian-s Church Town, and wished to be -directed in the road. The landlord of the Masons' Aras showed them the road; he had never seen Chadwick before nor since, till he saw him in the gaol yesterday. On the .27th of August, early in the morning, two men were seen in the copse searching in the bushes for something; as soon as they saw a persoa looking the men started, and Orpy went after them. They were at the time seven or -eight feet from the spot wbere the plate was afterwards found. The men went towards Stytbian's at a fast pace. * (rpy overtook the two men; they were Chadwick and -Jenkins. Orpy asked them why they came there for the * rabbits again, and Jenkins said, " I'm not after rabbits; I :have neither netsnordogs. Wehave missed sometbing andare in searcl of it, and have lost our road." Orpy said he would have them taken up before the day was out, and .le went back to see what they liad been doing in the copse. The grass and furze had been beaten down 40 or 50 feet round the spot where the plate was afterwards found. .Chadwick and Jenkins had been at Orpy's the night before, and had had a quart of beer. It had been said before this that the plate was hidden in that copse. There was a re-ward of 501. offered for the apprehension of the burglars. Christopher Orpy, the son of the man who owned the copse, xmade search for the plate between 2 and S in the day of the 2(th of August. After a long search he found plate .and silver under three stones and a furze-bush; he remnoved one stone, and then saw the silver. He made an alarm, and Edward Slade and others came; they took out Ahe plate. Some of it was in bags, and some loose. They carmed it about 100 yards, and then Holman, the constable. took it into his possession. The search was continued up to the 21st of October, when a gun was found lying flat among the furze. There was a "<brave" pile of silver. A man named Slade, who was a watchmaker, was at Stythian's that day - be heard the alarm made by Orpy; he went, and they pulled out the plate. The constable (Holman) took possession of the plate. The morning after the robbery the footmarks of two men were pointed out to Axmitage, the constable; they were in a plantation behind the Louse of Nirs. Peters. Ile measured the length of the footmarks: one measured 124 inclIes, the other .l0A full inches. On the 18th of September he apprehended Quick and took off his shoe, and made an imPression with it, and measured that mark; it was 124 Imches. Traced the footmarks for a quarter of a mile near to the place where one of the guns was found. Upon apprehending Quick Armitage gave him the usual caution, -and then conveyed him to Xledruth. He saw Quick again some hours afterwards, and remained with him two hours ; during that time be made a statement, and then asked the ,constable if he could recollect all he had told him, and said he had better get a pen and ink and paper, and put it downin writing. The constable did this, wrote and read it over to Quick, who said it was quite correct, and signed it. Arnitage was cross-exanmined upon this; he was a railway policeman, but was employed in this matter by Mr. Peters; knew there was a reward of 501. Chadwick at that time had been committed. The obtaining of the 501. depended upon the conviction of the prisoners. Asked Quick some questions when he apprehended him; told him ie had beard be was in company with Chadwick. A Mr. Nancarrow said if Quick had lost any time, by going to Mr. Peter's, he could tell it by his books. He then said be must take Quick to Redructh. Quick said he did not know Chadwick. Heard Nicholls, the constable, say to Quick that Jenkins's wife had told all about it. When he was in custody at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and when he was chained in a room, Armitage told bin he would not deceive him, but would toel the magistrate what he told him. Told him Iiis shoes corresponded with the marks he had found. Did not say to him the sooner lie confessed the better it would be for hins. 4The stateulent, which was a complete confession of the robbery, was read.)
Mr. COLE said all that could be urged for the prisoners, but more particularly contendl d that there was no evidence whatever upon which they could convict Chadwick.
The learned Jr),c: having summed up,
The jury Ao'pticdChadwick r.nd found Quick Clilty, but recommndeinded him to mercy because they thought he'had been led into it.
Quick was then sentenced to six years' penal servitude. Mr. Slade has been trying prisoners all day.
The Lord Chief Justico is expected here this evening.

BlIADLMALL V. LERLS.
This was an action brought by the plaintiff, as administrator.of Elizaheth Brisn;inall, his daughter, to recover compensation in daniages 'or the loss of her life by the defendant's negltgence.
bMr. Fill, Q.C., and Mr. Aepland appeared for the aintiff.; and Mr. Attorney-Generdl Eiaowles and Mr. 'Wheeler for the defendant.
Mr. HILL, in stating the case, said the plaintiff was an .artisan, at Sesleybridge, znd the defendant a chymist and .druggist in that town, and the action was brought under a recent statulte to recover compensation in damnages for the death of his dau,gh5er, wlhich was occasioned by the gross negligence of the defeudant. On the 13th of August last Elizabeth Bramnmall, the deceased, the 'daughter of the plaintiff, having a bowel complaint, her mother sent another daughiter Mary with a teacup and 2d. 'to buy two pennyvworth of tincture of rhubarb at the delendanlt's shop. The girl went and was served by thie defendant, who took dQwn a bottle ContainiDg a lark liquid, and poured somo into the teacup sbe had -with her, taking 2d. for it. This liquid the child took homie, and it was aduinistered to tho deceased Elizaheth. After she had taken it ihe became sick aRd went to hbe. In ,the course of the night cle was taken by her imother into 3ser own bed, thinking to inake her sznAe codfortable. Soon after the father's attention was aroused by hearing a rattling in the child's throat, aDd on getting up and striking a light the child appeared to be dead. A surgeon was sent for, the stomach pumnp applied, and every reuiedy resorted to which 'the surgeon could deviie, he thinking sbe had taken tine'ure of opiUnc, as in feet sbe had, the defend.ant having sold 'tircture of uputrn in)stead of tizcture of rhubarb. The child died in the course of next day. This action wvas brought under a recent statute, whicth enabled the, relatives of a person whose life was lost by the negligence of any person to sue him for the loss sustainedi by the deatlh. The jury woiild have to ettimate the pecuniary loss to the plaintiff by this child's death. She a-as one of several children, and was nearly 13 yearg of age. She s:as earning small wages, and when 13 yeatrs old she would have been able to work in a factory, where she would have earned 10s. a-week; and this suuo, besides supporting her, would have coAtributed tow'ards the support of the plaintiff's fatnily. For this loss the plaintiff sought pecuniary compens%tion in the present action.
The following witnesses werc then called
Mary Branu,mall, the vwife of the plaintiff, stated that on the 13th of August last. her daughter ElizAbeth being ilU she sent her daaghter Mlary to the eefendant's shop for sosle tincture of rhubarb, and gave her 2d. and a ap to put it in. She returned with the culp witb a liquid ia it. She got sotno warm waver and sugar to inix witeh it, and gave it io her daughLter Elizabeth about 9 o'clock at night. Her d.ughter Ehizoweth had not turned her thirteelbth year X11en bah vuk it she said it was very bitter, and wiues
sId tober, Drink it, it wLl do you goo, She then wfit to bed, and in les than 5 minutes she domplxaied of ber legs being numb. She then began to vomit, and witneEs asked her to get into ber ovwn bed, and she did to. She was again sick, and complained of her throat and breathing. Her husband was awoke about 2, and told the child to rmove a litt.le higher up. She never spoke, and he got a light, and they both thoaght she was dead. They immediately sent for Mr. Pearson, the surgeon, to attend the child. She died at 2 o'clock next day. She had been healthy before this time, and witness had sent for the tincture of rhabarb for her for a bowe complaint. The child was earning wages, and in six months would have been old enough to go into a factory. She was intended to go into a factory. Her daughter 3rary worked in a factory and also another daughter. She received their wages, and they were at least 5s. a-week benefitto her and her husband. 'he deceased child was also of great use to her in the house in many ways.
Cross-exanminea.dThe deceased would be 13 years of age at Chnistmas. She was in the service of a Mrs. Bullock part of the week, and gotls. 10d. wages. She slept at home and ained at home. She directed her daughter to go to Mr. Lees's shop for the tincture. 1r. Lees had paid the doctor and given her 5o., but it barely covered the expense of the funeraL
Re-examined,-Thirteen was the age that children were allowed to go and work faUl time in factories.
Mary Brammall, ecxamined, stated thab she went to Mr. Lees' shop, as directed by her mother, for twopennyworth of tincture of rhubarb. She sawMr. Lees at the shop. Hewas standing in the middle of the shop and asked her what she wanted. She told him twopennyworth of, tincture of rhubarb. He went round the counter and reached a bottle down and asked her how much she wanted. She said twopennyworth. He measured it into a glass and poured it into a onp she had with her. She paid him for it. She tasted it. It was very bitter. She then went two other errands and took the cup home, anl saw her mother put some warm water and sugar in it and give it to her sister to drink.
Cross-exainined. -She had been at other druggists' shops before; to a Mr. Bagaharw's many a time. Sbe did not go to Mr. Bagshaw's on this occasion, She went to Mr. Lees, and had been many a time at his shop and knew him wel. She got 5s. a-week when she first went to a factory, afterwards 10s. a-weelc.
Joshua Brammall, the plaintiff, examined.-His father was alive, and he allowed him 2s. a-week and his food. He intended his danghter Elizabeth to have gone into a factory as soon as she became 13 years of age. He expected to derive 5s. a-week benefit from her wages; and sbe was of great use in the house. He had sent his daughter Mary to the factory when she was 14 years of age.
Mlr. Pearson, surgeon, of Staleybridge, examined.-He was sent for on Friday morning, the 14h of August last, and found plaintiff's daughter in a c ,mplete state of insensibility. He at first thought that she was in a state of collapse from cholera; but on examination he found this was not so, and asked the mother what she had given her. He then asked for the cup and tasted the liquid in it. It was tincture of opium. He immediately used the stomach pump, and tried every expedient his skill could suggest, without avail. She died next day at 2 o'clock. He made a post mor-tem examination, and the appearances indicated death from the poison of opium. She was otherwise in a healthy state. He afterwards saw the defendant, and he showed witness how the mistake might have occurred. The bottle containing tincture of rhubarb was placed sideby side with the bottle containing tincture of opium. The liquid was of the same colour in each bottle, and the bottles were of the same size. The defendant said he was not aware le had made a mistake, but is must have been from getting hold of the wrong bottle.
Mr. Attorney-General KNovLEs submitted to his Lordship that the object of the statute was not to give a remedy in such a case as this, where the party deceased could have caused no pecuniary loss to the plaintiff by her death. Who could say that the child would ever have gone into a factory at all, or that she would bave lived, or that she would have continued to live at home when she was of an age to make a contract for herself ?
His LORDSHIP said the estimate of all damages was alvways speculative. He could not say there was not some injury to the father here.
Mr. HILL, in summing up, coutended that the mode in which the defendant had kept this bottle, containing a poisonous liquid, close to another bottle, containing a medicine much in request, of the same colour, and with no distinctive mark upon it, was gross negligence. lIe stated the facts from which the damages were to be estimated, and called upon the jury to assess such damages as the case reasonably demanded.
Mr. Attorney-General KNowi,gs, in addressing thee jry for the defendant, said the question was to be looked at, not as a matter of feeling, but as a money computation, and in no other light. Assuming that the defendant had done a negligent act n placing two such medicines, without distinction, side by side, he would direct their attention to what the Act of Parliament contemplated which gave this action. It was to allow an action to be brought to provide compensation for a family dependent on the exertions of a parent who was suddenly cut off by some accident arising from negligence. It could not be believed that the law was intended to enable a parent to come into court and traffic in the possible value of a child who was at the time of the accident a burden on her parents to support her. The support and clothes of this child would cost her parents more than the Is. 10d. per week which she earned. Asto the child's future value to the parents every step was clothed with uncertainty. He submitted that in a case like this it was impossible to assess any damages at all
His LoICDsssn, in summing up, left it to the jury to say what pecuniary or imoney loss the parents had sustained by the loss of the child. They were not to compensate the parents for the unhappiness and misery which the child's oss might have occasined them. The case was an unuasal one, as generally a child was a burden on the parents ; but in the manufacturing districts children -were said to be of value to their parents from the facility with which they obtained emplovmensot at high wages. They must consider the whole facts, and estimate what, if any, pecuniary loss the child had been to her parents by her death.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, damages 154, a shilling of it to the grandfather.

TlE: QUEEN V. NOLDWVITT.
This was an indictment against the defendant, John Spencer Noldwritt, charging him with wilful and corrupt ,cerjury.
The defendant pleaded ' Not Guilty."
Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. Lush, r. 1EHoll, and Mr. Wilkinson were counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Edwin James, Q. C., Mr. G. flennman, and Mr.,C. Pollock appeared for the defendant.
This case occupied the Court nearly the vhole of the day, but the facts layin anarrow compays. The prosecution arose out of an action that was tried at Croydon in the summer of 1855, in which the London and County Bank were the plaintiffs, and Mr. Noldwritt was the defendant, and it was brought to recover rrom him a sum of 5()01.upon a bill of exchange which purported to bear bis acceptance,and which had been discounted with the bank by a Mr. George Brooks, who carried on an extensive business as a poulterer in Leadenhall-market. Mir. Brooks was the principal witness upon that trial, and he swore that the defendant accepted the bill in question for his arcommodation. The defence set up was that the signature was a forgery, and Mr. Noldwritt was examined. and he swore that he never put his name to the bill or authorized it being done; and, after a long inquiry, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, thus eatsblishing the defence of forgery. Proceedings were subsequenitly taken against Noldwritt for perjury, the allegation of perjury being that he had falsely sworn that the accept. ance to the bill was not his handwriting; and the whole of the facts have been frequently before the public.
'Tlhe same evidence was now again given, and aU the circumstances above narrated were detailed by a number of wit.nesses.
Mr. JAMES made a most able speech to the jury on behalf of the defendant, and a host of respectable witnesses were exiamined, who testified to the high character he had borne for a nreat nuumber of years.
The learned JUDGE, in summing up, explained the law upon the question to the jury, and observed that they by no means were recquired to say that perjury had been committed by the principal witness in support of the charge if they acquitted the defendant ; but if it was not made out to their satisfaction that he had wilfully sworn that which he knew to be false it was their duty to acquit him.
The jury retired, and, after being absent about threequarters of an hour, they returned into court and gave a verdict of Not Guilty.

Yesterday afternoon the 82d and 90th Regiments, and the 23d Royal Welsh Fusileers, remaining in Portsmouth garrison, assembled on Southaca-conmon, on the occasion of the presentation of French war medals to two sergeants of the 23d, for distinguished conduct in the field. The troops having been formed into three sides of a square, the sergeants (Colour-Sergeant O'Neale and Sergeant Parkinson) were called forward, and Colonel Campbell, C.B., of the 90th (in the absence of Major-General Breton from indisposition), after a suitable address, received the medals from the hands of Brigade Major Nelson, and pinned them to their breasts The troops afterwards were put through the various evolutions of a field-day.
Her Majesty's steam three-decker Dake of Wellington, 131, Captain Caldwell, C.B., steamed into Portsmouth harbour yesterday to be paid off.
The construction of the steam corvette Galatea in Woolwich Dockyard is progressing with astonishing rapidity. Four gangs of shipwrights, making a total of 68 men, are constantly employed, and are pushing the work forward with great diligence. The first, second, and third futtocks are already laid down, and the floors crossed the entire length of the old shed. The heavy beams intended to form the flooring of the extra portion required to lengthon the building slip are also crossed and laid down, Iextending 40 feet beyond the usual length inwards.
The freight-shins Eglintosn and Canaan, at Deptford, are embarking stores from the War Department of Woolwich Arsenal for China, and are shipping a portion of the guns, shot, and ammunition belonging to the gunboats Lee, | Algerine, Firn, Watchful, Janus, and Drake, under orders
for Hongkong.
Captain Caffin, C.B., R.N., storekeeper-general of the Royal Ordnance, has transacted business with Mr. Pellatt, principal military storekeeper of Woolwich Arsenal, and other members of the select committee, with reference to the shipment of war materials for China. The freightship Violetb which arrived at the Arsenal pier on Wednesday, is to commence shipment of stores immediately, and will probably be fitted out for the accommodation of a portion of the Artillery troops to embark from Woolwich.
Her Majesty's new screw steamship Doris was launched on Wednesday from Pembroke dockyard. The Doris is one of our largest steam frigates, and is a sister ship to the Diadem, launched from the same yard a fewmonths since, and now being fitted at Portsmouth. The " christening" wva performed by Mrs. George Lort Philipps. The Doris is pierced for 32 guns, and is in length 240 feet between the perpendiculars, and 48 feet beam. Twenty 10-inch guns wiU be ranged upon her main dock, and the upper deck will be furnished with ten 32-pounders and two 68-pounders (pivot guns). The engines, which are nominally of 800 horse-power, are by Messrs. Penn and Son. The Doris will now be placed under the charge of Mr. Martyn, of Devonport, -who will at once jury-rig the vessel and navigate her to that port. where she will receive her engines and be made ready for sea. The following vessels are now being built at Pembroke Dockyard :-The Howe, 120 guns; the Windsor Castle (to be altered from a sailing to a screw vessel), 116 guns; the Orlando, of gigantic proportions, 50 guns ; the Revenge, two-decker, 90 gans; the Melpomene, 50; the Immortality, 50; the Aurora, 50, frigates; the Greyhound, 17 gums, and the Gannet, 11 guns, sloops.
The screw steam storeship Himalaya was appointed to go from Hamoaxe into Plymouth Sound yesterday. Her crew will be paid advance wages to-day, and she will sail tomorrow for Portsmouth.
The screw steam surveying-vessel Plumper, 12, Captain George 1H Richards, sailed from Plymouth Sound on Thursday for the Cape of Good Hope.
The artisans employed on the Belleisle, Kestrel, Hornet, and Sprightly, at Plymouth, are ordered to work extra hours.
Miss Elorence Nightingale, who was accompanied by Miss Carter and Sir Johe Liddell, ALD., F.R.S., Director-Gene. ral of the Medical Department of the Navy, arrived at Chatham on Wednesday for the purpose of inspecting the several naval and military hospitals of that garrison, in which there are at present upwards of 800 patients belong. ing to the various branches of the service. Miss Nightin. gale first inspected the Garrison Hospital at Chatham BarraeLs, over which she was conducted by Dr. A. Maclean. After spending some time in visiting the several wards, in which there are about 300 patients, the party proceeded to Melvile HospitaL This large establishment, which adjoins Chatham Dockyard, is used solely for patients belonging to the Navy and the Royal Marines, and, in consequence of its proximity to the two large naval establishments at Chatham and Sheerness, the wards are generally all occupied. The number of patients now in that hospital is upwards of 200, of whom 140 are Marines. MIiss Nightingale was conducted over the establishment by Dr. Drummond, Deputy-Inspector of Hospitals; the principal medical officer, Dr. Moody; and the other officers of the medical staff. During her inspection of this hospital, which occupied upwards of two hours, Miss Nightingale frequently expressed her warm approval of the excelent arrangements adopted for the comfort of the patients. She was also much pleased with the size of the wards, which are commodious, light, and well-ventilated; each patient, it was found on inquiry, having 1,260 cubic feet of space. After visiting thewholeof the wards, Miss Nightingale and the other visitors inspected the dispensing-rooms, washhouses, receiving-rooms, and other portions of that large establishment, all of which were found to be in excellent order, Miss Nightingale intimating her opinion that MelviUle Hospital was one of the best arranged and conducted establishments in this country. On leqving MelviUe the party proceeded to Fort Pitt general hospital, over which Miss Nightingale was conducted by Dr. J. R. Taylor, C.B., principal medical officer of the garrison, and Dr. J. C. G. Tice. Since the termination of the war the number of patients ut this hospitalhas been much reduced, there being only 194 in the establishment at the present time. Miss Nightingale spent some time at Fort Pitt in inspecting the internal arrangements of the bospital, with the whole of which she evidently appeared well satisfied. The inspection of the hospitals occupied the entire day.
Yesterday morning the head-quarters. stafi; and H troop of the 2d (the Qaeen's) Dragoon Guards, under the command of Colonel W. Campbell, arrived at Chatham from Dublin, under orders to proceed to Canterbury, where they relieve the 11th Hussars. The following officers also arrived with the head-quarters:-Captain J. OHara, Lieutenant F. G. Powel, Adjutant S. Calvert, Cornet G. B. Jarvis, and Veterinary-Surgeon Gudgeon. The 3d Dragoon Guards are also under orders to move to Canterbury from Ireland.
A large discharge of troops, to the number of 80 noncommissoned officers and men, selected from various cavalry and infantry regiments, took place yesterday morning from St. Mary's Barracks, Chatham. The troops discharged were previously inspected by a Board of Commissioners from Chelsea Hospital, and pensions awarded them according to their length of service. Seventy-eight men of all ranks were inspected yesterday and the previous day at Fort Pitt by Drs. Taylor and Tice, and all were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to be discharged.
We are informed that the launch of the Renown is not to be postponed, as stated, but will take place to-morrow at Chatham about 2 p.m.
The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:-
Commander Henry Trolope, to the Melville, vice Little, whose appointment is cancelled ; Lieutenant E. W. Hawes, to the Porcupine; W. Stanton, master, to the Porcupine; Francis H. Chown, clerk, to the ExceUent.
The Surrey Lunatic Asylum And Mr. Snape.
THE SUpRP.Y LUNATIC Asyuntr =?uD MR. SNAPE. -The charge adduced against Mr. Snape, a surgeon, of causing the death of a lunatic, named Dolley, in the Surrey Asylum, by ordering him a showerbath and strong doses of tas tar emetic, wil be fresh in the recollection of the public. The case is revived by the publicatioa of a long letter, ad dressed by the Secretary of the Commissioners in Lunacy to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and bearing the date of the 13t] of December, 16. The Commissioners bring before Sir 0. Grey's notice the facts which " rendered it imperative upon them, in the course of last year, to order a prosecution for manslaughter to be instituted against Mr. Charles iSnape." The Commissioners say that it would never have occurred to them to prosecute if they could have satisfied themselves, upon a review of all the circumstances attending the death of Dolley, that the administration of a showerbath of half an hour's duration to a man 65 years old, at a temperature of 45 deg. Faahrenheit, and followed by an unusually large dose of tartar emetic, was in any possible view to be considered as medical treatment banzd fidc intended for his benefit, how strongly soever they might have condemned such an experiment. Bat at this conclusion they found it impossible to arrive. Into the merits of the question, a reopened by the Commissioners,:it is not advisable to enter. The grand jury rejected the bill against Mr. Snape on the 15th of September; but up to the date of their letter the Commissioners had received no communication from the Committee of Visitors of the Asylum since thieir attention was first drawnx to the case, excepting those which, with the dates of the 23d of April and the 10th of May respectively, had announced the intention of the committee-first, to suspend al opinion or prooeedings in reference to Mr. Snape until the question of criminal proceedings against hinM should have been decided; and, secondly, to remove him from his offlice pending the proceedings instituted by the Commissioners. It further appars that the Committee of Visitors, on the failure of the prosecution against Mr. Snape, regarding the question " asone of strictly niedical experiaene," resolved on consulting. Ja ur of six medical men, three named by Mr. Snap- and three by them,qlves- This jury found a verdict " That Mr. SnaPe's cond_cbt )u the case dn question was zleither so rash' nor sos inju., lcsus as to deprive himn of the co3s6dence of the mag,if,akes -which he had previously ei9joyed;" Whereupon

PREA CRING AND PBEA CiING.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I am glad to see that the discussion which you have allowed me to raise excites so much interest and it ig especiaUy gratifying to me to find that l was right in my conjecture as to " Cantab's" true position in the Church.
Now, when it is considered that this learned Professor, in addition to the Regius Professorship of Divinity, holds the rectory ot Somersham, Hunts, which I see set down in the Clergy List at 1,7701. a- year, and that he is also Subdean and Canon of Lincoln, I reaUy think, for aU this money, we ought to have better logic, better Latin, and better French. Of his logic everyone may judge who has read his two letters, but, as all the world does not know Latin or French, I may remark that a man who on his own confession writes a letter in which, having first made a foul copy, he commits a gross grammatical error in three words of Latin, and two equally gross errors in two lines of French, may be very fit for a Regius Professorship, though it is not so certain whether he would not be plucked in one of those competitive examinations for schoolteachers which are now so common. " Oh !" says the Professor, "C but this was merely a slip of the pen." What, three slips of the pen in three lines, and in s fair copy too ! I hope no idle fourth-form boy at Eton will get a sight of the Professor's letter, or there is no knowing what use he may make of these slips of the pen in answer to the severe Dr. Goodford when that heavy-handed pedagogue requests the delinquent to favour him with a short interview in a certain place after schooL
" Ego bomuncio hoc non facerem. "
The Professor, though he reads not naughty Terence, will find the quotation in St. Augustii's Confessiois. For my own part, I must confess these slips of the pen have taken me by surprise. I was told that excessm anwre dei, however bad in classical times, might be very good Latin in Augustin and Jerome-lucky fellows not to be now at Eton-and that, as far as the Professor's French was concerned, it might be good rough Channel Island French, bearing the same relation to the Parisian article as bay salt does to dinner salt. In those favoured islands, for aught I know,
oix may be masculine, and the niceties of de and die may not be regarded. I thought, in fact, that this learned man was like that equally learned woman in Chaucer who spoke French
"After the scole of Stratteford at ye bowe,
"For French of Parys was to hire unknowe."
But it seems I was altogether wrong, and that these were only "slips of the pen which a child could correct;" an observation in which I quite agree, with the addition that I can conceive none but a child making them in a copy foul or fair.
But enough of the Professor. I am glad to see, bothbythelettersyou have published and by the mass of letters on the same subject which your space will not permit you to publish, but which you have sent to me, suppressing their names and addresses, that .this subject excites great attention. To those who are on my side, and theyare many, and to those who are against me, and they are many too, I return my best thanks. This is a subject which will grow by discussion, and the stone I have set rolling will not stop. One half of my opponents, at least, devote their time and energies to proving that I was wrong in my conjecture as to the position of " Cantab." These gentlemen I refer to " Cantab" himself, who by implcation confesses himself to be the Professor. One man savs I was a disappointed candidate for the Professorship. This man is like those political opponents of your own, who, when you say anything that they do not like, accuse you of having been bribed. They forget that this sort of charge recoils on the head of him that makes it; a vile accusation reveals a vile mind, and certainly I shouLd as SOOU think of opening a college for the deaf and dumb as of undertaking to teach candidates for orders-from which class mnany of my opponents have recently passed-moderation or common sense, much less Divinity. Many beg me to let well alone, asking what would satisfy me, besecching me to reflect on the Act of Uniformity and the thousand impediments to bringing about a better state of things. In reply, I say it is not well; it is il in the Church at prese nt. As to vhat would satisfy me, I say, once for all, I wish to see more services and shorter services. I desire to 'see fewer preachers and better preachers. I would separate the sermon altogether from the service. In towns, in the largest churches, men who had proved that they could preach should be allowed to
preach. In other churches service alone should he performed, and that more shortly and more frequently. One correspondent asks how T should like an Order in CounCil to-morrow that no clergyman of the Church of England who had not obtained the Queen's license to preach should preach for a twelvemonth ? I reply I should like it very much. We should then see how few possessed thuis precious gift of preaching, which at present all are supposed to have, and we should then see the bulk of the clergy, who are as ignorant, due regard being had to the change of times, as the 1eoman Catholic priesthood at the Reformation, turning to their proper pastoral duties, instead of wasting six or seven hours every week in writing discourses which are not worth the paper on which they are written, and which, in nine cases out of ten, send the congregation home in diszust.

I XBITAikS IN SICCO.
ibroad ±hylactery, March 26.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have read the powerful letters of your correspondent " Habitans in Sicco" under the above title, and although he introduced himself to your readers as a EHigh Churchman," and professes to wish well to the Church of England, I confess I am somewhat at a loss to reconcile the tone of his letters with any great partiality or goodwiU towards her communion.
I think he must admit that his strong expression, " That sluggish pool, the preaching of the Churchl of England,' would have been more applicable to the state of the church at the end of the last century than at the present day, and, altlsough there is still doubtless much room for improve. ment in the matter of preaching, yet it seems to me, I confess, hardly fair to publish to an the world (which by the aid of your columns he certainly does) that the clergy of I ur church consist of the "aged ecclesiastical cripples," " boys who would not earn l0s. a-week in any other trade," or of any other of the interesting specimens of the class which he so cleverly but severely depicts in his letters.
Besides, he must be aware that until the existing laws of the church concerning ministering in the congregation (see Art. 23), and the ordination of her clergy are altered, there is no way, even if the will existed, to allow Mr. Spurgeon or any other lay preacher, to preach in our churches, even supposing their doctrines agreed with those of the church which in most cases they certainly would not.
If " Habitans in Sicco" really has the welfare of the church at heart, as I sincerely hope h a has, let him use his undoubted talents in urging her lawful clergy to increased exertions in their several parishes, and to strive more and more both by word and deed to do the work of their Divine Master and increase His fold; but let him pause before he advocates the admission into onr pulpibt of any Dissenting preacber whose peculiar style of oratory may enable him to draw together a large number of hearers, although it may often be scarcely suited for the House of God ; and never lt him forget, as many seem to do, that the worship of the Most High consists in something more than the listening to a sermon, whether good or bad, and that the duty of a clergyman comprises many things even more important than the art of public speaking.
As he concludes his last letter, I scarcely know why, with the following questions-viz., ' The baptism of the Apostles and of the first centuries, was it infant or adult? Was it by immersion or sprinkling7."-I hope he will pardon me if I remind him, in answer to the first question, that as a Churchman he caunot consistently, in the face of the 27th Aricle, raise any doubts with respect to the doctrine of infant baptism, the latter part of such article expressly declaring that "the baptism of young children is in anyvise to be retained in the church, as most agrecable with the institution of Christ." If, however, be diesentsgfrom the church on this important article of faith, I am sure he will agree with me that the columns of yonr valuable paper are not the proper place for arguing the points, even though you, with your accustomed kindness, accorded space for the turposc.
With respect to his second query, I would merely refer him to the baptismal service in the Prayer Book, where he vill find that the church actually enjoins baptism by immersion, and only permits sprinkling in lieu thereof in case the child is weak and cannot endure the former method. So far, therefore, from the Church of England condemning baptism by immersion, it, in fact, enjoins it; and, although it certainly holds sprinklmg to be equally effilcacions, yet any person who wished it might have the rite performed by immersion.
Apologizing for the length of this letter, I remain, Sir, sour most obedient servmnt.

Althounh the coming elections compelled rmany of the aristocratic patrons of the meeting to absent themselves, yet the attendance of visitors of aU classes and conditions wvas not perceptibly below the average.
As the returns of the racng which have been already published will attest, the meeting fuUy maintained the reputation which it has of late years acquired for sport, not only of temporary interest, but of much prospective importance.
The race for the Northamptonshire Stakes caused St. Giles to be advanced to a leading poition in the betting on the Chester Cup, and brought Skirmisher into considerable notice for the Derby. The running of Gemnma GdiVergy and Fisherman's success for the Queen's Plate caused Fisherman to be backed for the Metropolitan, whQe saveral investments were made on Gemma di Vergy at an " outside price " for the Chester Cup.
Since last year many imnrovements have been effected. The Earl Spencer's Plato Oourse has been made perfectly straight, the Grand Stand has been enlarged, and by the COnstruction of suitable ofices additional facilities were
afforded for conducting tbe business of tho meetin&g
The fineness of the weather added materially to the plea sant character of the gathering.

Olympic Theatre.
OLYMPIC THBEA2RE. ,
Anything less novel in the shape of a drama than the piece produced last nightwith thetitlo of Daddy Hirdc'v couxld searcely bo conceived. It is simplIY a new version, h
ur. Pagrarve Simpso n, of the old Filc de l'Avare, founde by iIL Bayard and Dapont, pon the late M de Blza
novel Eguanic Gratndcf.. The French piece was played at the St. Janes's Theatre during the last enga,ement ot: M. Bouffe, and an English translation, by Mr. Bridgeniarr, was subsequently produced at the Olympic dunng thei. management of Mr. Farren.
But want of novelty in the piece itself is more thaniom.
pensated by the marvelous acting of Mr. Robson ,. imitating no predecessor, but merely following the dictates, of his own genius, represents the character of the rustic miser, supposed in the new version to be an Englishman,. and endowed with the dialect of a south-eastern county. The man is made intrinsically good-natured and even gooerbumnoured, but his love of money, and the preternatural shrewdness which he exercises both in getting and in keep-
ing, is so diffused over his whole nature that the. most trifling act is more or less under its influence. Hereally wishes that the nephew who has come all the wayfrom London to pay him a visit should feel perfectly co
fortable; but every item of expense by whic the comforb is promoted costs him a pang. The eggs, the hot rolls, the chocolate, al represent to his morbid fancy so manuyamounts of hard caslh and the arithmetical operation thab takes place in his mind is at constant war with his effort to, look easyland cheerful. When his nephew,ldetecting the distress, offersto pay for his own breakfast, the relief experienced by the oldimoney-worshipper is immense. Thereisnotonlyso, mnuch cash saved, but a painful internal struggle is reduced to a comfortable equilibrium. His love for his dauehter is to the highest degree unaffected-almost chldish, Hedelights to gaze upon her face, to fondle over her, and to. fancy that he forgets everything else while she is in his presence. But there is one tbing that he does not fo et thathe cannot forget, and that is money. In his fondest6 moments lie is aware that she is kneeling, and rapidly draws the inference that for the durability of gowns this is an unfavourable position. He would gratify her,prlde bytelling her that she is the richest girl of th 0illage and may pick and choose from all the neighbouring evsins
but his suspicious temperament checks him; and he wilt only let her knowv that she is fhougha rich. When he is. engaged in business, settling how a bargain may be struck to the best advantage, the exhibition is wonderful. The eagerness depicted in the face communicates itself to the arms and legs. He cannot sit easily in his chair while he is proving to his lawyer how he cnn take advantage of some unlucky wight's immediate necessities. Twostimulating causes are simultaneously at work to keep. him at the highest pitch of excitement,-namely,
ravenous cupidity and the consciousnessof s=perior shrewd.. ness, that vanity of cunning which is a distinct passion in. itself. As the moments of the highest joy are those which. render us most acutely sensible to reverses, so is it with our miser. While delighted at purchasing an estate dirt cheap. his happiness is marred by the thought that the very act of purchaso implies an outlay of money, and that deeds require costly stamps. We are describing ctutMr. Robsondoesto convey by description an idea hoto he does it is utterly impossible. The luxury of detail, the magical transition fronn one feeling to another must not only be seen but vatche& attentively in order to be fully appreciated. We may ada that nothing is done by way of trick. An individualdis placed under circumstances that lay bhare the recesses of his nature, and the revelation has all the variety that belongs to every thorough exhibition of concrete life.
All that we have sa-id refers to the first act which por-
trays the miser in a state as happy as is compatible with hi. nature. In the secoud, where he discovers that his daughter has plundered him, there is a prolongation of that kind of agony which wra first indicated in the Aula&aria, of Plautus, and afterwards followed up by the Avare of Molidre. It is the fault of thepiece that this explosion istoo extensive in itsduration. Thereportofapistolspreadoveran. hour would not be half so startling as itis under ordinary ecrcumstances, when it lasts for a second. Still we must admirethe untiring force and energy with which Mr. Robson supports the long continuance of passionate despair, and the variety of emotions which he crashes together in the storm. Admirable, above ill, is the courage with which he ventures to give the most debased expression to the agonies of a, grovelling nature. The manner in which he kneelshowling over the site of his lost treasure, and crawls on all-fours up a flight of stairs, would bo fatal in an artist of inferior genius but with him it becomes the extreme expression of a teri_b truth.
Miss Hughes, who represented tho miser's daughter, is new to this theatre, though, if we recollect right, she distinguished herself very creditably at the Lyceum during Mr. Mathews's management by her performance of the young lady in an English version of La Joie fit Pcur. Lat night she played in a most natural and unaffected manner fully supporting all the situations in which she was involved without once attempting to make herself unduly prominent. The displays of the miser must not be counterbalanced by any violent utterances of feeling on the part of the other characters; but there is full opportunity for an exhibition of intense enduring affection in the daughter, and this is accomplished by Miss laughes. Tho otber parts, which have been very well " Engliahed" by llr. Palgrave Simpson, were efficiently played by Messrs. G. Vining, G. Cooke, Leslie, and Mliss htevens.
Royal Society Of Musicians.-The 119th anni-
ROYAL SOCIETY or MusIcIANS.-The 1l9Dh anniversary festival of this highly useful charity took place at the Freemasons'-hall yesterday, wben about 130 members, subscribers, and visitors sat down to an excellent dinner. The president of the daywastheRightBon. Lord Ward, and next tohim sat Lord Saltoun, one of themost stanch sunpporters of' the society and of music generaUy. The formal proceedings on these occnsions have been so often described that it is unnecessary to refer to them at any length. After dinner "N on nobis Domine" was sung, according to time-honoured. custom, and, as usual, sung very finely by the majority of the "professionals" present. The ordinary routine of toasts was then gono through, beginning of course with " Her Majesty the Queen," which was duly folowed by the National Anthem. In coupling with that of the Royal family the health of the Duke of Cambridge, the noble President mnade a decided " hit," since the name of the Commander-in-Chief was hailed by three genuine and unanimous bursts of applause. The speech in which Lord Ward proposed "Prosperity to the Royal Society of Musicians" was interesting and to the purpose. His allusion to those absent members of the profession. whose duty he considexed it was to have been present conveyed a well-directed censure, and his general remarks upon the nature and objects of the society were both logical and eloquently delivered. In sahort, the dtbfpt (for we believe it was his d4db4t) of Lord Ward as chairman at this venerable and respected anniversary gathering may be recorded as a bonez .4dc success. The health of the noble chairman himselfproposed by Mr. T. H. Hall, hon. counsel to the society, in a very complimentary apostrophe-was drunk with musical honours, and followed by enthusiastic cheers. In returning thanks Lord Ward expressed in warm terms the satisfaction he had received from the evening's entertainment, assuring the company that it was his wish to attend every annual meeting of the Royal Society of MSusicians, and that no slight cause should henceforth suffice to prevent that wish rom being accomplished. The last oratorical display of his Lordship was a toast in honour of " The ladies who honoured this festival with their presence," anid this was accomplished in a style no less witty than gallant. The lst of subscriptions was communicated by Air. T. H. HaU and at the head of these figured the names of Lord Ward and the Messrs. Broadwood-the wealthy aristocrat, and the enterprising manufacturers-for 501. each. 'The announcement of the Messrs. Broadwood's donation was the signal for loud and long-continued cheering. The remembrance oE the recent conflagration in Horseferry-road, which entaled so immense a loss of property upon the house, combined with that of tho very many and munificent contributions of the Messrs. Broadwood to the funds of the Royal Society of Musicians, engendered a heartiness of feeling among all present that could not fail to find vent in the spontaneous burst of enthusiasm which followed. This new proof of their iberality, moreover, brought with it substantial and gratifying evidence that the fire had not been so disastrous in. its effects as mzaterially to cripple their resources. The followinr is the gener.al statemet of receipts and expenditure ofteoho Roal Society of Mtussoxaus from January 1st to December 31st, 1856:-

£el 575211 T leaving a balance " to the good" of 1546, 19s. 7d. The concert which succeeded the dinner, and agreeably relieved the " toasts," was varied and effective, and afforded unanimous satisfaction. Criticism on such an occasion being out of place, we may simply mention that there was a capital selection of glees, part-songs, madrigals, vocal duets, and solos, contributed by a number of weU-known vocalists; and that M. Remnnyi, solo violinist to the Queen, performed. Ernst's brilliant fantasia on the Pirata, being encored in which he substituted the same composer's. popular Carsia.val de Venisc. Miss Dolby was encored with acclamations in a very graceful song by Balfe, to Longfellow's words, " The day is cold, and dark, and dreary," in which she was accompanied on the pianoforte by Dr. Sterndale B,ennett, Cambridge Professor of Music. The other solo singers wore Mademoiselle Sophie Perlet, Iiss lIi. Wortley, Miss Poole, and Signor 3Iarras, wsho all snore or less distinguished themselves. In short, so attractive am entertainment merited a much larer attendance.
F5R1B AT THE CLAREKDON ±OTEL.-Thias ex;tensive establishment, situate in Albemarle-street, Piccadilly, next to the Royal Institution, and extending back to Oia Bondstreet, narrowly escaped destruction by fire on Wednesdayv About half-past 1 o'clock smoke was observed issui4from what was at first supposed to be the upper part of the Royal Institution, but shortly afterwards the roof of the Claren4on. Hotel (that portion fronting Albemarle-street) was dis. covered to be in flames. The brigade engines were soon om the spot, and two immediately got into play. Hearly 200 feet of hose had, however, to be affixed to the engine in order to admit of the branch being taken up the main Staircase in the hotel so as to reach the fire. The firemen prevented the fire from descending, ana ultimately confined the damage to the roof, although the water poured down into the suite of rooms below. Mfr. Braidwood, the superintendent of the brigade, afterwards, with Mr. Wright, the proprietor of the hotel, made ar
examination into the cause of the fire. On the vrevious evenin one of the hotel chimneys caught fire, which wag allowe to bur itself out. Some sparks were probablycarried underneath the slating of the roof, and resting orw some of the timbers there smouldered and produced thoe mischief. The hotel and its contents are insured for a scrf large amount in differeat insurance offices,
